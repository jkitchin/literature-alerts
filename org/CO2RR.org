The application of supermolecular naonostructures in the photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted increasing attentions. However, it still faces significant challenges, such as low selectivity for multi-electron products and poor stability. Here, the cuprous oxide (Cu2O)-modified zinc tetraphenylporphyrin ultrathin nanosheets (ZnTPP NSs) are successfully constructed through the aqueous chemical reaction. Comprehensive characterizations confirm the formation of type-II heterojunction between Cu2O and ZnTPP in Cu2O@ZnTPP, and the electron transfer from Cu2O to ZnTPP through the Zn-O-Cu bond under the static contact. Under the visible-light irradiation (λ > 420 nm), the optimized Cu2O@ZnTPP sample as catalyst for photocatalytic CO2RR exhibits the methane (CH4) evolution rate of 120.9 μmol/g/h, which is ∼ 4 and ∼ 10 times those of individual ZnTPP NSs (28.0 μmol/g/h) and Cu2O (12.8 μmol/g/h), respectively. Meanwhile, the CH4 selectivity of ∼ 98.7 % and excellent stability can be achieved. Further experiments reveal that Cu2O@ZnTPP has higher photocatalytic conversion efficiency than Cu2O and ZnTPP NSs, and the photoinduced electron transfer from ZnTPP to Cu2O can be identified via the path of ZnTPP→ (ZnTPP•ZnTPP)*→ ZnTPP-→ Zn-O-Cu → Cu2O. Consequently, Cu2O@ZnTPP exhibits a shorter electron-hole separation lifetime (3.3 vs. 9.3 ps) and a longer recombination lifetime (23.1 vs. 13.4 ps) than individual ZnTPP NSs. This work provides a strategy to construct the organic nanostructures for photocatalytic CO2RR to multi-electron products.

Abstract Nowadays high‐valent Cu species (i.e., Cu δ+ ) has been clarified to enhance multi‐carbon production in electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). Nonetheless, the inconsistent average Cu valence states have been reported to significantly govern the product profile of CO 2 RR, which may lead to misunderstanding of the enhanced mechanism for multi‐carbon production and results in an ambiguous roles of high‐valent Cu species. Dynamic Cu δ+ during CO 2 RR leads to erratic valence states and challenges of high‐valent species determination. Herein, we propose an alternative descriptor of (sub)surface oxygen, the (sub)surface‐oxygenated degree (κ) to quantify the active high‐valent Cu species on the (sub)surface, which regulates the multi‐carbon production of CO 2 RR. The κ validates a strong correlation to the carbonyl (*CO) coupling efficiency and is the critical factor for the multi‐carbon enhancement, in which an optimized Cu 2 O@Pd 2.31 achieves the multi‐carbon partial current density of ∼330 mA cm −2 with a faradaic efficiency of 83.5%. This work shows a promising way to unveil the role of high‐valent species and further achieve carbon neutralization. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved

In this study, the graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) was successfully synthesized through thermal polymerization under three different g-C 3 N 4 precursors such as urea (U-gC 3 N 4 ), melamine (M-gC 3 N 4 ) and dicyandiamide (D-gC 3 N 4 ) and then doped into the fibrous silica iron (FSFe), denoted as U-gC 3 N 4 /FSFe, MgC 3 N 4 /FSFe, and D-gC 3 N 4 /FSFe, respectively. The synthesized catalysts were characterized using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR), and UV-Vis Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (UV-Vis/DRS) and also tested for photocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to methanol (CH3OH). The study indicated that altering the precursors had a substantial impact on the physicochemical features of the FSFe, which in turn increased the catalytic performance of the conversion of CO 2 to CH 3 OH. U-gC 3 N 4 /FSFe exhibits the highest CH 3 OH yield (2.3 x 10 4 µmol gcat−1) compared to bare FSFe, D-gC 3 N 4 /FSFe and M-gC 3 N 4 /FSFe under visible light irradiation within 240 min. The higher CH 3 OH yield over U-gC 3 N 4 /FSFe is mostly owing to the lower bandgap energy of U-gC 3 N 4 /FSFe, as well as the advantageous interaction between g-C 3 N 4 and FSFe.

or zero-carbon fuels is necessary to reduce CO2 emissions. Gas reburning technology can be applied to existing coal boilers to reduce not only CO2 but also NOx emissions. In this study, we confirmed the gas reburning effect using lab-scale equipment based on the consumption coal used in real-scale boilers, with the aim of practical application. Bituminous coal was used as the reference fuel, and sub-bituminous coal was blended to determine whether coal blending has an effect on NOx emissions. This was conducted to optimize the coal blending ratio and gas reburning technology for NOx emission reduction and quantify the NOx reduction by the two methods. Blending sub-bituminous coal reduced the unburned carbon (UBC) content, because of its high volatile matter content. Moreover, NOx emissions decreased as the ratio of sub-bituminous coal increased. In terms of the reburning effect, although UBCs increased with the addition of methane, NOx emission decreased by up to 96.05%. The conversion ratio, defined as the NOx formation ratio of the total fuel N injection, was used to separate the NOx reduction effects of the two methods. Thus, gas reburning in the ammonia co-firing system of coal-fired power plants can significantly reduce NOx emissions.

China has been implementing energy efficiency and CO2 emission reduction schemes at the provincial level that have been embedded in the National Five Year Plans of the country. We set out to investigate the relationship between R&D expenditures and CO2 emissions in China at the province level in the context of the planned emissions reduction targets. We explore the possibility of the existence of a non-linear relationship between R&D expenditures and CO2 emissions with a non-parametric methodology, a fixed effect panel data quantile (FEQR) regression estimator applied to a panel of 30 provinces. We stratify the sample according to the five emissions reduction target tiers of the 12th Five-Year National Plan of China and we investigate the role of R&D expenditures in emissions reduction within each of the tiers. We find an inverse U relationship with different turning points for the three middle tiers and a U-shaped relationship for the tier under the most stringent environmental regulation. We find no effect in the tier with the least stringent emissions reduction targets. A further investigation shows that the above results are attributed to sectors with relatively low energy intensity and not to the sectors of heavy industry. The results allow us to draw broad conclusions about the effectiveness of investment in new technologies as a means of meeting the CO2 targets in China.

Producing Cn products through electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is of great significance in addressing the global warming crisis. Organic-inorganic hybrid catalysts, characterized by precise and controllable active sites and metal-ligand synergistic interactions, can enhance the reaction activity and stability of Cu-based catalysts. Herein, based on density functional theory (DFT), a novel flexible aromatic Cu3 metal-organic π-cluster (Cu3-π cluster) was constructed, consisting of triple-atom active centers and pentalyne ligands. During the catalytic CO2RR process, the adsorption of H can promote the activation of CO2, this converts the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) into promoting CO2RR. Enhanced aromaticity of its cluster core is credited with stabilizing the coadsorption of H and CO2 (H*+CO2*), consequently lowering the reaction free energy of the CO2 activation process. Research has shown that Cu3-π cluster have high catalytic activity for electrocatalytic CO2 generation of C2H4. Considering the solvation effect, the limit potential of this reaction is -0.60 V. Furthermore, the reaction free energies suggest that the Cu3-π cluster is more inclined to yield C2H4(g) products via COCO* coupling. Moreover, the high CO coverage at the triple-atom active centers not only makes it more challenging for this cluster to adsorb H, but also reduces the energy barrier of the COCO* coupling reaction.In the entire reaction pathway of C2H4(g), there exhibits dynamic self-adaptive behavior in the bond lengths and bond angles of the three Cu atoms in the cluster core, leading to fluctuations in aromaticity. The flexibility and aromaticity changes in this structure enable the Cu3-π cluster to better stabilize intermediates. This work provides theoretical guidance for the application of metal-organic π-clusters, accelerates the screening of catalysts for CO2RR, and provides powerful theoretical guidance for the structure-activity relationships between aromaticity and catalytic activity.

Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CO(2)RR) has emerged as a prospective and appealing strategy to realize carbon neutrality for manufacturing sustainable chemical products. Developing highly active electrocatalysts and stable devices has been demonstrated as effective approach to enhancing the conversion efficiency of CO(2)RR. In order to rationally design electrocatalysts and devices, a comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic structure evolution within catalysts and micro‐environment change around electrode interface, particularly under operation conditions, is indispensable.

This review systematically introduces the applications of synchrotron radiation technologies classified by radiation sources with varying wavelengths in CO(2)RR. By virtue of in situ/operando synchrotron analytical techniques, we also summarize relevant dynamic evolution processes from electronic structure, atomic configuration, molecular adsorption, crystal lattice and devices, spanning scales from the angstrom to the micrometer. The merits and limitations of diverse synchrotron characterization techniques are summarized, and their applicable scenarios in CO(2)RR are further presented. On the basis of the state‐of‐the‐art fourth‐generation synchrotron facilities, a perspective for further deeper understanding of the CO(2)RR process using synchrotron analytical techniques is proposed.

The Zn-containing HMCM-22 samples with different zinc species were prepared and characterized to discriminate the influence of zinc species on the ethane activation by the initial C-H bond cleavage or the β-H cleavage dehydrogenation step of alkyl zinc species (Zn-C2H5) through the propane co-dehydroaromatization and CO2 reduction process. The synergistic effect of zinc species types with the Brønsted acid sites (BAS) of the parent zeolite HMCM-22 had a significant effect on the ethane dehydroaromatization. The synergistic effect between ZnO species and BAS had better ethane conversion and aromatic selectivity in ethane dehydrogenation, while the poor synergistic effect between ZnOH+ species and BAS was not conducive to the formation of aromatic, and ZnOH+ species was more conducive to ethane dehydrogenation. The ZnOH+ has better catalytic performance in CO2 activated ethane and promote the β-H desorption of Zn-C2H5 in ethane dehydrogenation. The synergetic effect of ZnO species and BAS in the zeolite facilitates the hydride transfer activation of ethane by propylene carbenium ions thus enhancing the ethane conversion through ethane-propane co-aromatization.

Synergistic interactions between the atoms in double atom catalysts has emerged as a promising tool to tune and boost CO2 activation and reduction. In this work, we systematically designed highly stable transition‐metal‐free homo‐ and hetero‐biatomic catalysts based on Al, Be, B and Si supported on TCNQ monolayer for CO2 reduction to C1 products using dispersion corrected periodic density functional theory calculations. Our findings reveal that transition‐metal‐free homo‐and hetero‐biatomic TCNQ catalysts can effectively capture and activate the CO2 molecule with binding energies ranging from 0.09 to 2.35 eV. Extensive free energy calculations to screen the favourable reaction pathways to different C1 products (CO, HCOOH, CH3OH and CH4) demonstrate that Al2‐TCNQ, AlBe‐TCNQ and BeSi‐TCNQ stand out as potential candidates for catalyzing CO2RR to methanol in a selective manner, suppressing the competitive HER simultaneously. Remarkably, BeSi‐TCNQ shows the best catalytic activity towards CO2 reduction to methanol at record low limiting potential of ‐0.29 V with spontaneous desorption of the final product. From the in‐depth examination of the electronic structure details, integrated projected density of states and crystal orbital Hamilton populations are used to understand and rationalize the binding interactions between the adsorbed CO2 molecule and the homo‐ or hetero‐biatomic TCNQ catalysts.

The exhaust gases in production of burnt clay bricks is responsible for greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission which increase the carbon footprint in the ecosystem. Here, we report carbon emission and thermal performance based evaluation of 8 ft. × 9 ft. × 8 ft. building. The bricks used in building construction are manufactured from fly ash, agro-forestry wastes, construction & demolition wastes (C&D), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) using NaOH as activator in order to provide compressive strength in the range of 3-6 MPa with ambient curing at 30 °C for 28 days. Life cycle analysis (LCA) reveals the total CO2 emission for fly ash and burnt clay bricks estimated to be 43.28 gCO2 and 290 gCO2 per brick, respectively. Considering the current scenario, by replacing 1-2% of brunt clay bricks with agro-forestry waste, C&D waste based fly ash bricks can potentially reduce 0.5-1.5 million tons of CO2 emission annually. The embodied energy calculation shows fly ash based bricks consumes 10-15 times less energy as compared to burnt clay bricks. Thermal paremeters viz., U-value (0.5-1.2 W/m2K), thermal conductivity (0.4-0.5 W/mK) show adequate insulation of agro-forestry waste based fly ash bricks highlighting its importance of thermal comfort, CO2 reduction along with sustainable and eco-friendly construction practices.

For the scope of commercial supermarkets, the demand for energy efficiency improvement and environmentally-friendly working fluid of the refrigeration system is necessary. In this study, supermarket booster refrigeration system by using eco-friendly working fluid CO2/halogenated alkene (HA) mixture is proposed, and the mixture used in systems with two evaporation temperatures and operating modes affected by ambient temperature are studied. The energy efficiency, economic performance and emission reduction potential of the whole life cycle are conducted to compare with the pure CO2 booster refrigeration system. Furthermore, the influence of climate condition is discussed when used in 40 typical cities around the world. The results show the coefficient of performance (COP) of booster refrigeration system can be significantly improved by using CO2/HA mixtures. As the ambient temperature is 33 °C, the CO2/R1234yf (93/7) operates with the maximum COP of 1.367, which is 11.59% higher than that of pure CO2. Using CO2/HA mixtures in the booster refrigeration system can significantly improve the exergy efficiency of system. Moreover, the system using CO2/HA mixtures has higher annual performance factor and lower life cycle cost (LCC) than pure CO2. LCC of the system using CO2/R1234yf (94/6) is the lowest, and the reduction rate is 3.06∼5.59%. Meanwhile, the life cycle carbon emissions of systems in different climatic regions using CO2/R1234yf can be reduced by 2.39∼5.21%. The booster refrigeration system adopting CO2/HA mixtures is a promising alternative solution for commercial supermarket refrigeration and energy-saving.

In this study, the environmental improvement effectiveness of CCU(Carbon capture & utilization) technology is analyzed, based on LCA(Life cycle assessment) methodology. Target CCU technology is synthesis process which uses carbon dioxide as raw material and produces useful materials such as DMC(Dimethyl carbonate), methanol and etc. As a result of LCA performed, 25 g CO2 eq. of greenhouse gases is reduced during life cycle for treating 1 kg of carbon dioxide. Therefore, target CCU technology produces an effect on greenhouse gas reduction. And electricity consumption of synthesis process is the main issue of GWP results. The improvement of energy type of synthesis process is effective for GWP. 746 g CO2 eq. of greenhouse gases is reduced by changing energy type of synthesis process. As a result, life cycle GWP reduction is obtained. The scenario analysis about carbon dioxide transportation distance is performed. In case of the distance of carbon dioxide transportation is farther than 97.13 km, the amount of greenhouse gas emission during life cycle is larger than avoid and target CCU technology is ineffective for greenhouse gas reduction. Consequentially, target CCU technology is effective for greenhouse gas reduction. And the region for installing the process should consider the distance of carbon dioxide transportation.

Carbon capture and storage(CCS) is a technique that aims to capture carbon dioxide(C02) from emissions and store it somewhere, thus it attracts public attention as a reduction method of the greenhouse gases(GHGs). To achieve GHGs reduction goal complying with 2005 level by 2050，internationally it is forecasted that CCS will reduce 19% of total greenhouse gas. Also, South Korea has a plan to reduce 32 million tons of CO2 emission, which is 10% of total national GHGs, by using CCS techniques by 2030. There many technical efforts and researches for CCS system for GHGs reduction, however, there has been little study on ecological and environmental impact assessment and research for CCS system. The CO2 storage at underground and deep saline aquifer can contribute for GHGs emission reduction, however, the CO2 leak from storage can affect ecological system and this cause other serious problems. Also we cannot expect its impacts. Therefore, in this study, we suggested a life cycle impact assessment method, which can be applied to the CCS system, as not a global warming emission but an ecotoxicity factor for CO2 emission. When CO2 emission is considering as an ecotoxicity emission, first we can identify the quantity and concentration of CO2, and then it can be translated to l,4-dichlorobenzene(DCB) equivalent value, which is ecotoxicity characterization factor. This life cycle impact assessment method can be applied to CCS system effectively. By using this suggested life cycle impact assessment method in this study, we can interpret in terms of global warming and ecotoxicity aspects and it will contribute for safe CCS technology development.

The chemical transformations of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) greenhouse gases typically have high energy barriers. Here we present an approach of strategic coupling of CH4 oxidation and CO2 reduction in a switched microbial process governed by redox cycling of iron minerals under temperate conditions. The presence of iron minerals leads to an obvious enhancement of carbon fixation, with the minerals acting as the electron acceptor for CH4 oxidation and the electron donor for CO2 reduction, facilitated by changes in the mineral structure. The electron flow between the two functionally active microbial consortia is tracked through electrochemistry, and the energy metabolism in these consortia is predicted at the genetic level. This study offers a promising strategy for the removal of CH4 and CO2 in the natural environment and proposes an engineering technique for the utilization of major greenhouse gases.

Abstract Digital technology, including advancements in artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and data analytics, has the potential to revolutionize tackling the problem of carbon dioxide emissions and achieving sustainable development. The paper aims at checking the nature of the impact of digital technology development on carbon dioxide reduction for the EU countries in 2013–2020. The study applies the following methods: entropy methods, panel‐corrected standard error, and feasible generalized least squares. The digital technology development index enabled the classification of all the EU countries into two distinct groups: High Digital Technology Development and Moderate/Lower Digital Technology Development. The findings confirm that digital technology development has a significant impact on decreasing carbon dioxide emissions. In the first stage, the growth of digital technology causes a faster decrease in carbon dioxide emissions. However, beyond a certain threshold, the further improvement of digital technology results in diminishing marginal benefits of CO2 emissions reduction. Thus, the EU government should catalyze the extension of digital technologies among all sectors and levels. In addition, it requires enhancing digital literacy of the society and local authorities.

To quantitatively evaluate the co-benefits of air pollution reduction and carbon dioxide reduction of Taiyuan's 14th Five-Year Plan air pollution prevention and control policies, this study used the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Greenhouse Gas-Air Pollution Interaction and Synergy Model (GAINS-JJJ) to simulate and evaluate the emission reduction potential and CO2 co-benefit of 13 air pollution control measures. The emission reductions of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NOx, VOCs, and NH3 in 2025 were 1.8 (5%, compared with that in the baseline scenario), 2.5 (2%), 3.7 (16%), 20.0 (27%), 13.6 (15%), and 0.0 kt (0%), respectively. The reduction in CO2 emissions was 9.0 Mt (13%), whereas CH4 emissions increased by 203.3 kt (25% increase relative to that in the baseline scenario). SO2, NOx, and VOCs emission reductions derived from the power, industrial combustion, and solvent use sectors. CO2 reduction occurred mainly in the industrial combustion sector, and CH4 emission increased mainly due to the increase in coal mining activity. The highest synergistic CO2 reductions were achieved by restricting energy consumption in the high energy-consuming and high-emitting sectors; prohibiting new capacity in the steel, coke, cement, and flat glass industries; and replacing coal-fired power generation with renewable energy. Furthermore, the CO2 reduction co-benefit was highest for VOCs. In addition, this study suggests that promoting the policy of terminal electrification and simultaneously increasing the share of clean energy and the ability to consume renewable energy generation in the power sector are the keys to decreasing the emissions in Taiyuan.

The transition from conventional soil treatment technology to zero treatment technology contributes to an increase in carbon sequestration (Sorg) in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere into the soil and, as a result, a reduction in the adverse effects of the greenhouse effect on the ecological state of the environment. The effectiveness of the application of zero tillage is to a greater or lesser extent due to specific agro-climatic conditions, crop rotation systems, fertilizers and plant protection, soil quality and stability. The influence of zero tillage on the dynamics of sorghum reserves and greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, N2O, CH4) in the agro-climatic conditions of crop production (LLC “Orlovka AIC”, Samara region) was investigated. The study was conducted on agrochernozem heavy loam in September–November 2021 in conditions of an abnormally arid growing season and high summer temperatures. On plots with zero tillage, plant residues were received: 268–1720 kg С/ha, 3–66 kg N, 0.2–7.7 kg P and 12–44 kg K/ha. Based on the results obtained, recommendations are proposed for further improving the efficiency of zero tillage technology due, firstly, to reducing its adverse effect on the density of soil composition, and, secondly, taking into account the influence of underlying parent rocks and relief on water erosion of soil and redistribution of granulometric fractions of soil in the agricultural landscape, which will allow using this technology according to principles of adaptive landscape farming.

This study aims at life cycle assessment on valuable sorting/recovery from small household appliances was carried out. The recycling process mainly consists of 1st-stage crushing, manual dismantling, magnetic separation, 2nd-stage crushing and wet gravity separation process. This process is designed to process about 8 tons of used small household appliances per day, but it processes 800 kg per day for efficient sorting/recovery of the downstream wet gravity separation process. GWP was estimated to be about 9.24E+02 kg CO2-eq./f.u when each valuable resource was sorting/recovered from 1 tonne used small appliances. The environmental impacts on GWP among the environmental impact categories for sorting/recovery by valuable resources were about 65.7 % for PS/ABS 6.07E+02 kg CO2-eq., about 29.0 % for PP 2.68E+02 kg CO2-eq., about 2.9 % for ferrous metals 2.72E+01 kg CO2-eq., and 2.22E+01 kg CO2-eq. for copper And about 2.4 %. The effects of environmental and economic benefits are analyzed compared to the amount of virgin material recycled as recycled material, and the environmental impacts of 1.93E+03 kg CO2 yield were analyzed. If it translates into carbon emissions reduction, it will result in an economic impact of about 5,777 thousand won per year. In addition, environmental avoidance effects were analyzed to reduce carbon dioxide levels of about 237.8 tons per year. Recycling process including gravity separation techniques used in recycling process, which is used in the recycling companies, the environmental avoidance effect on the sorting/recovery of the final valuable resources is inefficient. In addition, when the wet gravity separation system for sorting plastics is applied, it is analyzed that the environmental load is caused by the use of the water and the treatment of the generated wastewater. It is urgently required to develop a crushing, disassembling technique and sorting technology in order to efficiently sorting and recover the valuable resources generated in the recycling process of used small household appliances made of various constituent materials.

Coastal saline soil is an important reserve resource for arable land globally. Data from 10 years of continuous stubble return and subsoiling experiments have revealed that these two conservation tillage measures significantly improve cotton rhizosphere soil organic carbon sequestration in coastal saline soil. However, the contribution of microbial fixation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has remained unclear. Here, metagenomics and metabolomics analyses were used to deeply explore the microbial CO2 fixation process in rhizosphere soil of coastal saline cotton fields under long-term stubble return and subsoiling. Metagenomics analysis showed that stubble return and subsoiling mainly optimized CO2 fixing microorganism (CFM) communities by increasing the abundance of Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Chloroflexi, and improving composition diversity. Conjoint metagenomics and metabolomics analyses investigated the effects of stubble return and subsoiling on the reverse tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle. The conversion of citrate to oxaloacetate was inhibited in the citrate cleavage reaction of the rTCA cycle. More citrate was converted to acetyl-CoA, which enhanced the subsequent CO2 fixation process of acetyl-CoA conversion to pyruvate. In the rTCA cycle reductive carboxylation reaction from 2-oxoglutarate to isocitrate, synthesis of the oxalosuccinate intermediate product was inhibited, with strengthened CO2 fixation involving the direct conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to isocitrate. The collective results demonstrate that stubble return and subsoiling optimizes rhizosphere CFM communities by increasing microbial diversity, in turn increasing CO2 fixation by enhancing the utilization of rTCA and 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycles by CFMs. These events increase the microbial CO2 fixation in the cotton rhizosphere, thereby promoting the accumulation of microbial biomass, and ultimately improving rhizosphere soil organic carbon. This study clarifies the impact of conservation tillage measures on microbial CO2 fixation in cotton rhizosphere of coastal saline soil, and provides fundamental data for the improvement of carbon sequestration in saline soil in agricultural ecosystems.

Carbon sequestration and conservation is one of the important ecosystem functions of the forest. The task of modern science is to explore the possibilities of enhancing this function in order to counter the increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Sustainable and climate smart forestry, in particular the use of mineral fertilizers, are an effective way to increase the productivity of forests and enhance their carbon-sequestration capacity. This review aims to summarize the experience of using mineral fertilizers in boreal and temperate forests. It is concluded that fertilization should be selective, and it is most effective in combination with other forest management operations. A significant effect is observed on sites with medium-productivity conditions on sites with with sufficient, but not excessive moisture, at the age of the maximum current increment of biomass or commercial wood (40–70 years for coniferous species). The most common (inexpensive, but effective) are N-fertilizers, but it is necessary to control the content of other nutrients, in particular P, K and B. We have collected and published a database of long-term experiments on the application of mineral fertilizers. Experiments have shown that the absorption of 1 t of CO2-eq. requires from 5.6 to 10.3 kg (on average 7.2) of nitrogen. The results of a fertilizer application project should be compared against the baseline (without fertilizer application), and the difference can be counted in emission reduction units.

Decomposition of solid waste in landfills causes global air pollution with methane, the most dangerous of the greenhouse gases. The emission potential of this gas is 28-36 times greater than that of CO2. With the help of methane-reducing Biocover, can find a solution to this problem. In this study, a biocover was developed in the laboratory to reduce methane emissions. When measuring the methane emissions of this biocover, data on the amount of carbon dioxide emissions were also obtained in parallel. The purpose of this study is to clarify the interaction between methane emission reduction and carbon dioxide emission flux. The laboratory experiment consisted of three parts. The first part was the creation of experimental tubes. Three experimental columns with a diameter of 160 mm and a height of 1500 mm were created. Active compost saturated with water at a thickness of 500 mm was used as a source of methane, a permeable layer of sand at a thickness of 300 mm was further formed and finally covered with biocover. Biocover represents 60% of fine-fraction waste, 20% of soil and 20% of compost. The second part was taking measurements. All measurements were performed with the Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) gas measurement device Picarro G2508. The third part was the analysis of the obtained data. The obtained data were analyzed by processing the data and obtaining the interaction between these gases. The experiment is planned to be continued by obtaining long-term emission data. This will help to develop more promising future approaches to reduce methane emissions from landfills. This research contributes to the understanding of sustainable environmental management practices and underscores the importance of a holistic approach to address multiple greenhouse gases simultaneously.

Climate change is driven by the increase in greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide (CO2), leading to a rise in the global average temperature. This temperature rise unleash far-reaching and profound consequences on various living organisms. In this research work, we formulate a nonlinear mathematical model to perceive the impact of rising temperature on wildlife species. In formulating the model, we take into account that the escalating CO2 concentration contributes to a rise in the global average temperature, thereby impacting the growth rate of wildlife population. We pinpoint the sufficient conditions for all the dynamic variables to reach their simultaneous equilibrium levels. The model analysis reveals a spectrum of bifurcations, including transcritical, Hopf, saddle–node, and Bogdanov–Takens bifurcations. Further, the examination of transcritical bifurcation led to the identification of a critical reduction rate of wildlife species due to human activities above which the wildlife population may teeter on the brink of extinction under the considered stressor of temperature rise. This extinction of wildlife species can be avoided by increasing the carrying capacity of forest biomass. Also, we have shown that for a specific set of parameter values, there exists a bistability between the forest-wildlife free equilibrium and the coexisting equilibrium.

In recent years, a number of technologies have emerged to purify biogas into biomethane. This purification entails a reduction in the concentration of polluting gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide to increase the content of methane. In this study, we used a microalgal cultivation technology to treat and purify biogas produced from organic waste from the swine industry to obtain ready-to-use biomethane. For cultivation and purification, two 22.2 m3 open-pond photobioreactors coupled with an absorption-desorption column system were set up in San Juan de los Lagos, Mexico. Several recirculation liquid/biogas ratios (L/G) were tested to obtain the highest removal efficiencies; other parameters, such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, and biomass growth, were measured. The most efficient L/Gs were 1.6 and 2.5, resulting in a treated biogas effluent with a composition of 6.8%vol and 6.6%vol in CO2, respectively, and removal efficiencies for H2S up to 98.9%, as well as maintaining O2 contamination values of less than 2%vol. We found that pH greatly determines CO2 removal, more so than L/G, during cultivation because of its participation in the photosynthetic process of microalgae and its ability to vary pH when solubilized due to its acidic nature. DO, and temperature oscillated as expected from the light-dark natural cycles of photosynthesis and the time of day, respectively. Biomass growth varied with CO2 and nutrient feeding as well as reactor harvesting; however, the trend remained primed for growth.

Recent ground-based observations of Venus have detected a single spectral feature consistent with phosphine (PH3) in the middle atmosphere, a gas which has been suggested as a biosignature on rocky planets. The presence of PH3 in the oxidized atmosphere of Venus has not yet been explained by any abiotic process. However, state-of-the-art experimental and theoretical research published in previous works demonstrated a photochemical origin of another potential biosignature—the hydride methane—from carbon dioxide over acidic mineral surfaces on Mars. The production of methane includes formation of the HC · O radical. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations predict an energetically plausible reaction network leading to PH3, involving either HC · O or H· radicals. We suggest that, similarly to the photochemical formation of methane over acidic minerals already discussed for Mars, the origin of PH3 in Venus' atmosphere could be explained by radical chemistry starting with the reaction of ·PO with HC·O, the latter being produced by reduction of CO2 over acidic dust in upper atmospheric layers of Venus by ultraviolet radiation. HPO, H2P·O, and H3P·OH have been identified as key intermediate species in our model pathway for phosphine synthesis.

The possibility of conjugate electroreduction of carbon dioxide and hydrogen in the presence of 2,2'-bipyridine and its N -substituted salts in the presence of acids with different pKa values was studied. It was revealed how the strength of the acid affects the efficiency of the process; in particular, it was determined that the presence of methylsulfonic acid in the system promotes the conjugate formation of hydrogen and the reduction of carbon dioxide to formic acid. Probable mechanisms for the reactions occurring have been proposed.

In carbonation reaction, the impact of surfactants on the movement and mass transfer behavior of carbon dioxide bubbles were crucial for the production of high-quality silicon dioxide products. The study employed the Matlab image processing system to investigate the shapes, motion velocities, and rise path of single carbon dioxide bubbles within varying concentrations of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) solutions. This exploration aimed to elucidate the effect of CTAB on the movement and mass transfer coefficient (MTRC) of single carbon dioxide bubbles. Alterations in the CTAB solution concentration and bubble sizes significantly influenced the mass transfer and movement characteristics of single carbon dioxide bubbles. The conclusion was drawn through the computation of the MTRC of single carbon dioxide bubbles in deionized water and CTAB solutions: the addition of CTAB significantly reduced the mass transfer efficiency of carbon dioxide in deionized water, with the MTRC of CTAB solutions decreasing as the solution concentration increased. Utilizing the stagnant cap model, it can be concluded that CTAB's reduction of the MTRC of carbon dioxide was attributed to the high viscosity of the medium, low bubble velocity, stable flow conditions, and intensified adsorption degree of CTAB molecules at the gas-liquid interface. According to the significant periodic trajectories of single carbon dioxide bubbles in the stable range, the correlation between the trajectories of compressible bubbles in surfactant solution and mass transfer in liquid phase was established, and the previous method based on rigid sphere model was modified. The paper proposed the mechanism of CTAB's influence on single carbon dioxide bubbles, offering crucial theoretical insights into the industrial application of surfactants in the carbonation process for producing silicon dioxide.

The global surge in the warming trend is predominantly attributed to the substantial release of greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide. Despite continuous international efforts to curb these emissions, our country, marked by the largest population and energy consumption, stands as a major contributor to carbon dioxide emissions. Unlike developed nations, we face a more formidable challenge in reducing emissions, demanding intensified endeavors. To address climate change, our nation has set a crucial carbon emission target: achieving a carbon peak before 2030 and attaining carbon neutrality by 2060. The "14th Five-Year Plan" of each province underscores the significance of "carbon peaking and carbon neutrality," tailoring emission reduction policies to individual economic landscapes. Current research inadequacies hinder theoretical guidance needed to meet the 2030 carbon peak. Crafting province-specific emission reduction strategies is thus imperative. This study aims to scrutinize national and regional carbon dioxide emissions in four distinct Chinese regions, utilizing the STIRPAT model to predict emissions from 2020 to 2030 under the "low development and strong low carbon" paradigm. Initial analysis from 2004 to 2019 showed an annual increase in national and provincial carbon dioxide emissions, revealing significant regional differences. Six prominent factors influencing emissions were identified. The STIRPAT model predicted emissions for 2020 to 2030, indicating that achieving carbon peaking before 2030 is unfeasible under the baseline scenario. However, within the "low development and strong low carbon" framework, attaining this goal becomes plausible.

In this study, the potential carbon absorption is assessed by applying the methodology of the revegetation project in the business to the project site using the methodology of the emission trading system offset system, and then assessing the potential of the project site though economic analysis. The study found that the annual carbon dioxide absorption in this study was assessed at 1,179tCO2-eq. Economic analysis shows that if the project is carried out to 60 years due to renewal, net profit is 2.1 billion won, which is more economical.

Based on Green Slow model, this paper builds a framework to achieve carbon peak driven by manufacturing, energy-conservation and energy substitution technology concurrently.Through a panel dataset from 2000 to 2018 at the province level, we find that the increasing carbon emissions effects from manufacturing technology are primarily due to increased levels of disposable income resulting from technological advances applied in production, which increases the demand for energy consumption and results in the emission of more carbon dioxide. China's carbon emissions have been significantly reduced by energy-conservation and energy-substitution technology, which reduce the amount of fossil energy used in the generation of clean energy while increasing its share. These results suggest that to achieve carbon peak and further improve the carbon reduction effect of energy-conservation and fossil fuel alternatives technologies, local governments should strive to create an enabling environment for technology development.

Numerous industrial processes utilise gaseous chemical feedstocks to produce useful chemical products. Atmospheric and other small molecule gases, including anthropogenic waste products (e.g. carbon dioxide), can be viewed as sustainable building blocks to access value-added chemical commodities and materials. While transition metal complexes have been well documented in the reduction and transformation of these substrates, molecular complexes of the terrestrially abundant alkaline earth metals have also demonstrated promise with remarkable reactivity reported towards an array of industrially relevant gases over the past two decades. This review covers low oxidation state and hydrido group 2 complexes and their role in the reduction and transformation of a selection of important gaseous substrates towards value-added chemical products.

The multi-community integrated energy system holds significant potential in facilitating the decarbonization of energy distribution in the context of carbon neutrality. However, the literature review reveals the gaps in the comprehensive examination of hybrid energy sharing and hydraulic-thermal dynamic processes within the system, which can compromise the security and stability of the energy supply and lead to insufficient dispatch. To address these challenges, this research proposes a bi-level optimization framework for the day-ahead dispatch of the multi-community integrated energy system, novelly taking hydraulic stability and economic efficiency as optimization objectives. Hybrid energy sharing is considered as one of the processes of system operation rather than merely a constraint. To accurately capture the hydraulic and thermal dynamic characteristics, a dynamic-correction quasi-dynamic model is proposed for hydraulic-thermal coupling calculation in the heating networks. Additionally, Latin hypercube sampling and backward reduction are applied to address the uncertainty of renewable energy. The results show that the proposed optimization framework can achieve a 22.19 % reduction in operation costs and a 42.35 % reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, the maximum hydraulic steady time is significantly reduced from 360.02 s to 136.39 s, indicating effective suppression of extreme hydraulic instability conditions. In conclusion, the proposed optimization model offers a viable solution to enhance the economic efficiency of the multi-community integrated energy system and mitigate hydraulic instability in heat transmission.

Achieving peak carbon dioxide emissions and accelerating decarbonization progress in the power industry is of paramount significance to Henan Province's objective of achieving carbon peak and neutrality. In this study, the Carbon Emission-Energy Integrated Model (iCEM) was employed to conduct scenario studies on the coal reduction and carbon reduction paths under the "dual-carbon" goal of Henan's power industry. The results indicated that, by considering measures such as optimizing the power source structure and technological progress, Henan Province's power industry carbon emissions will reach their peak between 2028-2033, with coal consumption in the power industry continuing to grow during the "14th Five-Year Plan" period. With a peak range between 2027-2031, the peak value increased by 1881, 1592, and 11.48 million tce, respectively, compared with that in 2020. To control coal in Henan Province under the constraint of carbon peak goals, it is proposed to develop clean energy sources such as wind and solar power, use more low-carbon or zero-carbon heat sources, increase the proportion of external electricity supply, and enhance energy-saving transformation in coal-fired power plants. Accelerating the elimination of backward units and energy-saving transformation of existing units, accelerating non-fossil energy development, advanced planning for external electricity supply, improving market mechanisms for the exit of coal-fired power plants and peak regulation, increasing system flexibility, and accelerating external policies to ensure clean energy security are effective paths for controlling coal and reducing carbon emissions in Henan's power industry. Additionally, inland nuclear power layout is one of the crucial paths to alleviate coal control pressure in Henan Province and achieve "dual-carbon" goals during the carbon-neutral stage. Therefore, it is imperative to conduct research on demonstrations in advance. Henan Province is highly dependent on energy from other provinces, and the power supply and demand situation in Henan Province will become increasingly tense in the future. It is necessary to support Henan Province from the State Grid and coordinate the construction of inter-provincial and inter-regional power transmission channels.

Based on the integrated model of Super-SBM model, spatial Durbin model (SDM) and Grey neural network model, this paper analyzes the panel data of various provinces in China from multiple angles and dimensions. It was found that there were significant differences in eco-efficiency between organic rice production and conventional rice production. The response of organic rice to climate change, the spatial distribution of ecological and economic benefits and the impact on carbon emission were analyzed. The results showed that organic rice planting not only had higher economic benefits, but also showed a rising trend of ecological benefits and a positive feedback effect. This finding highlights the importance of organic rice farming in reducing carbon emissions. Organic rice farming effectively reduces greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide and methane, by improving soil management and reducing the use of fertilizers and pesticides. This has important implications for mitigating climate change and promoting soil health and biodiversity. With the acceleration of urbanization, the increase of organic rice planting area shows the trend of organic rice gradually replacing traditional rice cultivation, further highlighting the potential of organic agriculture in emission reduction, environmental protection and sustainable agricultural production. To this end, it is recommended that the Government implement a diversified support strategy to encourage technological innovation, provide guidance and training, and raise public awareness and demand for organic products. At the same time, private sector participation is stimulated to support the development of organic rice cultivation through a public-private partnership model. Through these measures, further promote organic rice cultivation, achieve the dual goals of economic benefits and environmental benefits, and effectively promote the realization of double carbon emission reduction targets.

The industrial sector that can actively respond to the circular economy is remanufacturing. In the case of machine tools, the need for remanufacturing of machine tools is emphasized because it is expected that waste products will increase before the mechanical life expires due to the change in perception of low carbon energy reduction and the increase in demand for advanced high-precision machine tools due to the development of ultra-precision industry. This study calculated the environmental load and greenhouse gas reduction effects through LCA analysis of the remanufacturing of four major machine tools used throughout the industry, such as grinding machines, planar millers, presses, and lathes, using LCA. Due to the nature of the remanufacturing process, some consumables are replaced or put in to improve quality and function by using the core of the product (or part) after use. In the case of cores used in the remanufacturing process, environmental impacts have already occurred during manufacturing by new manufacturers. In remanufacturing, only the environmental impacts caused by the use of newly input auxiliary materials and energy, excluding cores, occur. As a result of the Midpoint LCA analysis, the amount of reduction in environmental impact for each product remanufactured were 4,439 kg CO2 eq. per machine based on the global warming impact category during characterization, the planar miller 90,080 kg CO2 eq., the press 636,390 kg CO2 eq., the lathe 24,638 kg CO2 eq., it was found that the reduction of environmental impact was the highest when one press was remanufactured.

Background Health care is a significant contributor to climate change. Global pressure for a change towards a more sustainable way of providing dental health care has resulted in the creation of the Green Impact Toolkit, which is comprised of a list of suggested changes that dental practices can make to become more sustainable in a number of categories, such as procurement, waste and water.Aims To compare the effectiveness of changes suggested by the Green Impact Toolkit.Materials and methods A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted using the Ecoinvent database v3.8 and these data were processed using OpenLCA v1.10.3 software.Results The carbon footprint per patient was significantly reduced after the recommendations were implemented. For instance, using water from a rainwater collection tank instead of the mains supply saved 30 g CO2eq (carbon dioxide equivalents) per patient, a 90% reduction in carbon footprint.Discussion This comparative LCA identified some effective changes which can be easily made by a dental practice. Nevertheless, some actions require some initial financial investment and may be difficult to implement in a busy modern dental practice setting.Conclusion The findings from this study can be used to guide dental practices to making choices which are more sustainable and eco-friendly in the future.

Cities, where human energy activities and greenhouse gas emissions are concentrated, contribute significantly to alleviating the impacts of global climate change. Utilizing the China Carbon Emissions Accounting Database (CEADs) to provide carbon dioxide emission inventories for urban areas in China at the prefecture level, this study closely examines the historical evolution trajectories of carbon emissions across 247 urban units from 2005 to 2019. The logarithmic cubic function model was employed to simulate these trajectories, evaluating urban emission peaks and classifying the different carbon emission trajectories. Further, the Geographical and Temporal Weighted Regression model was employed to explore spatiotemporal traits and essential variables that impact the variations in carbon emissions among four identified trajectory types. Our results showed that Chinese urban carbon emission trajectories can be classified into four categories: a) peaking emissions, b) fluctuating growth, c) continuous growth, and d) passive decline. Specifically, 43 cities, primarily in North China, proactively attained their emission peak post-2010, driven by the reduction in secondary industry and energy intensity. 90 cities, largely industrial hubs in the southeast coast and inland, reached an emission plateau around 2015, exhibiting fluctuating growth due to dependencies on secondary industries. 101 cities, predominantly located in western and central regions, demonstrated a clear upward trend in carbon emissions, propelled by rapid urbanization and heavy industry-oriented economic development. Lastly, 13 cities, typically in the northeastern and southwestern regions, experienced a passive decline in carbon emissions, attributable to resource depletion or economic downturns. It is evident that China's city-level carbon peaking has demonstrated some effectiveness, yet considerable progress is still required.

Introduction The use of pressurised metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) and asthma exacerbations necessitating healthcare reviews contribute substantially to the global carbon footprint of healthcare. It is possible that a reduction in carbon footprint could be achieved by switching patients with mild asthma from salbutamol pMDI reliever therapy to inhaled corticosteroid-formoterol dry powder inhaler (DPI) reliever therapy, as recommended by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Methods This post hoc analysis included all 668 adult participants in the Novel START trial, who were randomised 1:1:1 to treatment with: as-needed budesonide-formoterol DPI, as-needed salbutamol pMDI, or maintenance budesonide DPI plus as-needed salbutamol pMDI. The primary outcome was carbon footprint of asthma management, expressed as kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions (kgCO 2 e), per person year. Secondary outcomes explored the effect of baseline symptom control and adherence (maintenance budesonide DPI arm only) on carbon footprint. Results As-needed budesonide-formoterol DPI was associated with 95.8% and 93.6% lower carbon footprint compared with as-needed salbutamol pMDI (least squares mean 1.1 versus 26.2 kgCO 2 e; difference −25.0, 95% CI −29.7 to −20.4; p<0.001) and maintenance budesonide DPI plus as-needed salbutamol pMDI (least squares mean 1.1 versus 17.3 kgCO 2 e; difference −16.2, 95% CI −20.9 to −11.6; p<0.001), respectively. There was no statistically significant evidence that treatment differences in carbon footprint depended on baseline symptom control or adherence in the maintenance budesonide DPI arm. Conclusions The as-needed budesonide-formoterol DPI treatment option was associated with a markedly lower carbon footprint than as-needed salbutamol pMDI and maintenance budesonide DPI plus as-needed salbutamol pMDI.

Cobalt and nickel-based bimetallic catalysts supported over titanium dioxide and zirconia were synthesized using the mechanical mixing method and investigated for catalytic methane decomposition reaction. The total contents of both metals were kept at 15 wt% and the ratio between cobalt and nickel remained one. The catalyst characterization prior to reaction showed that zirconia-supported nickel and cobalt-based catalysts represented as ZNC exhibited weaker metal-support interaction as well as easily reducible active species while titania-supported nickel and cobalt-based catalysts denoted as TNC had relatively stronger metal-support interaction. The activity results revealed that ZNC activated at 500 °C (ZNC-500) catalysts performed better with a maximum hydrogen production rate of 7.26 mol/gM/s than their TNC counterparts i.e., TNC-500 (5.83 mol/gM/s). The elevated activation temperature resulted in the loss of activity that was assigned to metal particle agglomeration. Moreover, elevated activation temperature caused the reduction of surface oxide species without allowing the reduction of bulk oxide species. The extent of interaction between the metal and the support, reducibility, and the degree of metal particle aggregation have significantly influenced the catalytic activity as well as carbon growth mechanisms of the catalysts. The characterization of spent catalysts using SEM and TEM discovered that carbon nanomaterials were formed over the surface of the catalysts and each catalyst followed either base-growth and/or tip-growth mechanism.

In recent years, fossil-based fuels have been used to supply the energy needs of the world. Fossil-based fuels induce accumulation of the atmospheric CO2 which causes global warming. One of CO2 source is flue gas emission from the power plant. The microalgae have been considered excellent biological materials for reduction CO2 with ability to photosynthesis. In this study, air, 10% CO2, 15% CO2 and simulated flue gas (containing 15% CO2) feed were used to observe effect CO2 concentration and flue gas on cell growth and lipid content of Chlorella protothecoides. The highest dry cell weight (1,5 g/L) and lipid content (45%) values were obtained with 15% CO2 feed while the highest growth rate (1,10), biomass productivity (0,125 g/L/day), and lipid weight (0,63 g/g) were observed in 10% CO2 feed. Cultures fed with flue gas did not inhibited C. protothecoides growth and showed similar results with those fed with 15% CO2 gas in terms of growth rate, dry cell weight, biomass productivity and lipid content. These results showed that C. protothecoides has great potential for reducing CO2 emission from flue gas.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technique for trapping CO2 as it is emitted from large point sources, compressing it, and transporting it to a suitable storage site where it is injected into the ground. CCS system can attribute to the reduction of CO2 and currently many projects in the world are commercializing. In South Korea, many researches are concentrated upon the CO2 capture processes in CCS system. In this study, we evaluated environmental impact of CCS infrastructure system, which has CO2 capture, transportation and storage stage using life cycle assessment (LCA). Also we assessed the costs for each CCS stage operation with scenarios. As a result, the global warming impact in a system without CO2 capture process was 9.64E+04g CO2-eq and a system with CO2 capture process had 1.45E+05g CO2-eq. About 1,368 kJ/ton CO2 energy is required for CO2 capture and it could remove 90% of occurred total CO2 from electricity generation. The result of life cycle cost analysis shows that the cost of 500MW size electricity generation and CCS system is 1,045 million US dollar and the operation cost per year is 154~267 million US dollar. As a result of the life cycle costing, current value of 20 years total cost is 4,236 million US dollar. For the future dissemination of CCS system, the database of the quantified environmental impacts and cost analysis in each stage (capture, transport and storage) should be updated and constructed regularly.

In a context where clean energy has become almost an imperative, investments in renewable energy projects play an important role for achieving the sustainability of scarce resources needed for the well-being of future generations. Driven by the fact of climate change and the very need for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions all around the world, renewable energy economy has expanded with increasing participation of investors and new types of innovative financial techniques. One of the most striking innovative financial techniques is green bonds, started with the issuance of the �climate awareness bond� by the European Investment Bank in 2007. International Capital Market Association�s (ICMA) publication of the Green Bond Principles (GBPs) in 2014, further motivated the expansion of the green bond market. Green bonds, are fixed-income securities which are issued to finance exclusively positive impact generating projects related to environment and climate change. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the development of global green bond markets with their related advantages, disadvantages, and policy implications. A green policy proposal will be made for enhancing the financing of renewable energy projects.

Livestock is one of major sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in China. Clarifying spatiotemporal characteristics of GHG emissions from livestock and exploring influencing factors can provide reference for grasping regional changes of GHG emission and formulate strategies of carbon reduction for livestock industry. However, existing literatures considered both spatial and temporal impacts and dynamic evolution trend of these factors seldomly. This paper used the life cycle assessment (LCA) method to estimate GHG emissions of livestock in 114 cities of the YRB from 2000 to 2021. On this basis, spatiotemporal heterogeneity of influencing factors was analyzed by using geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model. Finally, future evolution trend of GHG emissions from livestock was predicted by combining traditional and spatial Markov chain. Four main results were listed as follows. Firstly, GHG emission in the life cycle of livestock industry increased from ××carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2000 to 77.568 Mt CO2e in 2021. Secondly, structure of livestock industry, labor flow and mechanization were vital factors that led to increase of GHG emissions from livestock. Positive effects of labor flow and mechanization were increasing year by year, while negative effect of urbanization and positive effect of economic development were decreasing year by year. Markov chain analysis shown that probability of keeping high level of GHG emissions of livestock in the YRB unchanged were 96% (T = 1) and 90% (T = 5), and there also existed a Matthew effect. In addition, probability of level transfer of GHG emission in urban livestock was spatially dependent. Government should formulate strategies for livestock development and optimize low-carbon transformation of energy structure for livestock and poultry husbandry based on local conditions and key driving factors in the future. Meanwhile, boundaries of administrative divisions should be broken to promote reduction of GHG emissions in livestock comprehensively.

This study aimed to compare the environmental aspects of different water treatment systems using life cycle assessment (LCA). The target system of this study is the three different physical treatment systems which are sand filtration, pressurized type membrane filtration and immersed type membrane filtration. The key environmental issues in this study are analyzed in terms of abiotic resource depletion (ARD) and global warming potential(GWP). As a result, sand filtration represents the worst environmental impact. In case of GWP, sand filtration is about 17 and 27.5% higher than pressurized type and immersed type membrane filtration. ARD has same trend compare with GWP. Impact of sand filtration is about 16.5 and 27.4% higher than. Most of impacts are caused by electricity which considers 40 years operation time of the system. And we can derive benefit from trading of CO2 on market. If we sell tons of CO2 which come from emission reduction, we can earn around 463 thousands and 748 thousands euro from exchange sand filtration for pressurized type and immersed type one. Immersed type by this study is the best choice for reduction of CO2 and sustainable water supply.

The distribution of the concentrations of CH4 and CO2 and other gases in the sediments of the Kara, Laptev and East Siberian seas was studied. A correlation was found between CH4 and CO2 in most sediment cores. The correlation coefficient R for the sediments of the Kara Sea ranges from 0.58 to 0.97 and does not depend on the gas distribution with depth. Methanogenesis in marine sediments is presumably associated with sulfate reduction, and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis leads to an increase in CH4 concentration against the background of high CO2 concentration. The high concentration of dimethyl sulfide in the sediments indicates the simultaneous formation of CH4 and CO2 through methylotrophic methanogenesis with the participation of CH3SCH3. In the upper layers of the sediment, opposite trends in the CH4 and CO2 distribution can be observed. The fact that the correlation coefficients between CH4 and CO2 gases in the sediments of the Laptev Sea acquire both negative and positive values is probably related to the fact that gas formation processes in the upper layers of the sediment captured by short columns differ from those of deep layers.

Electrification of bus fleets is an effective approach to reducing transportation-related pollution and carbon emissions. Evaluating the impact of electrification on existing bus fleets can provide valuable insights for promoting full electrification of public transportation in large cities. Utilizing the fuel life cycle method, we analyzed the CO2 and pollutant emissions of Zhengzhou's bus fleet before and after electrification and evaluated emissions under different electrification scenarios. Our results indicated that after electrification, the fuel life cycle CO2 and PM2.5 emissions increased by 32.6% and 42.6%, respectively, whereas CO, NOx, and VOC emissions decreased by 28%, 34%, and 25%, respectively. Optimizing the power generation structure is a critical factor in reducing CO2 and PM2.5 emissions during the electrification process. The best scenario for comprehensive electrification and power generation structure optimization could result in a 38.7% reduction in CO2, as well as reductions of 80.1% in CO, 84.4% in NOx, 92.2% in VOC, and 30.2% in PM2.5. Prioritizing electrification on long-distance routes is recommended during the replacement process. Additionally, replacing plug-in hybrid natural gas vehicles with pure electric vehicles has both advantages and disadvantages in terms of emission reduction. Achieving pollution reduction and carbon synergies requires advancing fleet replacement and power structure adjustments simultaneously.

Here, the unsupported Ni5Ga3 catalyst was prepared at different reduction temperatures in H2 for methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation. The structural variation incurred by changing the reduction temperature was characterized carefully (including extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)) and related to the activity and reaction mechanism (by in situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)). The findings show the significant influence of H2 activation on the structural properties, activity, and selectivity of the catalysts. Specifically, Ni5Ga3-500 (i.e., reduced at 500 °C) encourages the copresence of Ga2O3 and NiGa alloys, which is key to achieve the appropriate interaction strength with the CO2-related intermediates, thus giving comparatively highest CO2 conversion and methanol yield. Longevity tests (100 h) of Ni5Ga3-500 showed slightly declined performance at the lower reaction temperature (viz., 220 and 260 °C), which was due to the further reduction of Ga2O3 and NiGa alloying during the catalysis.

Cyclic and repeatable CO2/H2 formation under periodic CO ↔ H2O feeds, that is unsteady-state water–gas shift reaction (uss-WGS), was found to be catalyzed by a gold nanoparticles-loaded CeO2 (Au/CeO2) catalyst. Kinetics of the CO-reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ and Ce3+ reoxidation by H2O in combination with transient CO2/H2 formation over Au/CeO2 were studied by operando ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) and infrared (IR) spectroscopies at 175 °C. The Ce4+–OH species were reduced by CO to give Ce3+-□-Ce3+ (□: oxygen vacancy) and gas phase products (H2, CO2). The Ce3+-□-Ce3+ species were oxidized by H2O to give H2 and Ce4+–OH species. The reduction and reoxidation rates of Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple were close to the rates of transient CO2/H2 formation. The X-ray absorption spectroscopy results showed that the oxidation states of Au remained unchanged during the redox reactions. These results indicate that the uss-WGS is primary driven by the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple. Combined with the observation of adsorbed carboxylate intermediates as a precursor of H2 and CO2, associative redox mechanism is proposed as the main pathway for the unsteady-state WGS reaction on Au/CeO2 at 175 °C.

Abstract Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal (ECCO 2 R) is used in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients to facilitate lung-protective ventilatory strategies. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) allows individual, non-invasive, real-time, bedside, radiation-free imaging of the lungs, providing global and regional dynamic lung analyses. To provide new insights for future ECCO2R research in ARDS, we propose a potential application of EIT to personalize End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) following each reduction in tidal volume (VT), as demonstrated in an illustrative case. A 72-year-old male with COVID-19 was admitted to the ICU for moderate ARDS. Monitoring with EIT was started to determine the optimal PEEP value (PEEP EIT ), defined as the intersection of the collapse and overdistention curves, after each reduction in VT during ECCO 2 R. The identified PEEP EIT values were notably low (< 10 cmH2O). The decrease in VT associated with PEEP EIT levels resulted in improved lung compliance, reduced driving pressure and a more uniform ventilation pattern. Despite current Randomized Controlled Trials showing that ultra-protective ventilation with ECCO 2 R does not improve survival, the applicability of universal ultra-protective ventilation settings for all patients remains a subject of debate. Inappropriately set PEEP levels can lead to alveolar collapse or overdistension, potentially negating the benefits of VT reduction. EIT facilitates real-time monitoring of derecruitment associated with VT reduction, guiding physicians in determining the optimal PEEP value after each decrease in tidal volume. This original description of using EIT under ECCO 2 R to adjust PEEP at a level compromising between recruitability and overdistention could be a crucial element for future research on ECCO 2 R.

Abstract The mass transfer from a stagnant CO2 gas pocket to the flowing water in a horizontal pipe was investigated experimentally, considering the application of pH adjustment by injecting gaseous CO2 for raw water in water treatment industries. In the experiments, the variation of the CO2 gas pocket volume and the corresponding pH values of the pipe flow with time under different conditions were recorded. The mass transfer coefficient of the CO2 gas pocket in the pipe flow was then calculated. The results showed that the injection of gaseous CO2 into the pipe flow could effectively adjust the pH. The volume of the CO2 gas pocket decreased exponentially. Different from most studies on bubble mass transfer, it was found that the ambient CO2 concentration could not be neglected in this study due to the large volume of the gas pocket and the restricted space in the pipe. The mass transfer coefficient increased with the increasing ratio of the CO2 injection rate to the water flow rate and exhibited a sharp reduction as the volume of the CO2 gas pocket decreased by about 80%. The outcomes of this paper can contribute to a better understanding of gas bubble mass transfer in pipe flows.

This study conducted the environmental load comparative analysis between unclassified thermoplastic wastes incineration/landfill and recycled thermoplastic blocks manufacturing with considering the avoided burden effects of concrete bricks manufacturing by using the LCA methodology and quantitatively calculated the environmental advantages of recycling unclassified thermoplastic blocks manufacturing. As a result of the environmental impact assessment of the recycling unclassified thermoplastic blocks manufacturing, ODP was decreased by 1.49E-05 kg CFC-11-eq./unit, and the reduction ratio was 99.95% which implies removing most of all environmental impact. POCP also decreased by 1.64E+00 kg C2H4-eq./unit, and the reduction ratio was 99.88%. AP also was decreased by 2.30E+01 kg SO2-eq./unit, and the reduction ratio was 97.92%. EP also was decreased by 2.79E+00 kg PO43--eq./unit and the reduction ratio was 96.86%. The reduced amount of GWP also was 1.49E+03 kg CO2-eq./unit and the reduction ratio was 83.77%. But, ADP was decreased by 1.92E-01 kg Sb-eq./unit and the reduction ratio was 15.09% which is the least reduction effect among the six environmental impact categories. The results of this study imply that recycling unclassified thermoplastic wastes can eliminate most of all environmental impacts in the four categories (ODP, POCP, AP, and EP) compared to thermoplastic waste incineration/landfill. In particular, the reduction of CO2 emission can be visualized at the same level as the amount of annual greenhouse gas absorption of 634 pine trees or 421 oak trees. The implications derived from this study have a clear purpose as macroscopic basis data for the necessity of recycling waste thermoplastics and business strategy, and this suggests the possibility of derivative research through a more sophisticated data collection process in future research.

Environmental issues are rarely investigated within the framework of different urban development patterns, especially concerning CO2 emissions. This research works to reveal the trends and determining factors of urban CO2 emissions under different urban development patterns. Taking the cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) as an example, this study develops an identification system in light of the dynamics of urban population and population density to categorize urban development patterns as growth, potential shrinkage, smart shrinkage, and continuous shrinkage. Then, the Theil-sen medium analysis and spatial econometric modeling are applied to shed light on the trend and influencing factors of CO2 emissions, respectively. The findings indicate that urban growth and potential shrinkage are the main development patterns in the YREB, and the percentage of growing cities and potentially shrinking cities is more than 77% across the different geographic areas of the YREB. CO2 emissions are remarkably heterogeneous under different urban development patterns. Over 90% of cities show a growth trend or fluctuation in per capita CO2 emissions under the four development patterns during 2010∼2019. Only a few growing and potentially shrinking cities show a decreasing trend in per capita carbon emissions, suggesting a severe peak carbon challenge in the YREB. CO2 emissions in growing and shrinking cities are significantly influenced by their neighboring cities. Factors affecting CO2 emissions are different in shrinking and growing cities, and spatial spillover effects enhance the role of these factors. Compared with growing cities, improving population concentration, developing appropriate tertiary industries, strictly controlling land expansion, and developing green areas can pave the way for carbon emission reduction in shrinking cities. This study can support designing efficient carbon emission reduction measures for various cities.

Single atom metal–nitrogen–carbon materials have emerged as remarkably potent catalysts, demonstrating unprecedented potential for the photo-driven reduction of CO2. Herein, a unique Cu@g-C3N5 catalyst obtained by cooperation of single atom Cu and nitrogen-rich g-C3N5 is proposed. The particular CuN diatomic active sites (DAS) in Cu@g-C3N5 contribute to the formation of highly stable CuOCN adsorption, a key configuration for CO2 activation and CC coupling. The synergistic diatomic active sites interaction is found responsible for the efficient photoreduction of CO2 to C2H4 which has been demonstrated in our Gibbs free energy calculation and COHP analysis. The CO2 activation mechanism was studied, the charge density difference and DOS analysis show that the low oxidation state Cu atom significantly affects the electronic structure of g-C3N5 and then enhance the catalytic activity of CO2 hydrogenation.

Microbial CO2 fixation into lactic acid (LA) is an important approach for low-carbon biomanufacturing. Engineering microbes to utilize CO2 and sugar as co-substrates can create efficient pathways through input of moderate reducing power to drive CO2 fixation into product. However, to achieve complete conservation of organic carbon, how to engineer the CO2-fixing modules compatible with native central metabolism and merge the processes for improving bioproduction of LA is a big challenge. In this study, we designed and constructed a solar formic acid/pentose (SFAP) pathway in Escherichia coli, which enabled CO2 fixation merging into sugar catabolism to produce LA. In the SFAP pathway, adequate reducing equivalents from formate oxidation drive glucose metabolism shifting from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway. The Rubisco-based CO2 fixation and sequential reduction of C3 intermediates are conducted to produce LA stoichiometrically. CO2 fixation theoretically can bring a 20% increase of LA production compared with sole glucose feedstock. This SFAP pathway in the integration of photoelectrochemical cell and an engineered Escherichia coli opens an efficient way for fixing CO2 into value-added bioproducts.

Despite the considerable efforts made by the community, the high operation cell voltage of CO2 electrolyzers is still to be decreased to move toward commercialization. This is mostly due to the high energy need of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the most often used anodic pair for CO2 reduction. In this study, OER was replaced by the electrocatalytic oxidation of glycerol using carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles as an anode catalyst. In parallel, the reduction of CO2 to CO was performed at the Ag cathode catalyst using a membraneless microfluidic flow electrolyzer cell. Several parameters were optimized, starting from the catalyst layer composition (ionomer quality and quantity), through operating conditions (glycerol concentration, applied electrolyte flow rate, etc.), to the applied electrochemical protocol. By identifying the optimal conditions, a 75–85% Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward glycerol oxidation products (oxalate, glycerate, tartronate, lactate, glycolate, and formate) was achieved at 200 mA cm–2 total current density while the cathodic CO formation proceeded with close to 100% FE. With static protocols (potentio- or galvanostatic), a rapid loss of glycerol oxidation activity was observed during the long-term measurements. The anode catalyst was reactivated by applying a dynamic potential step protocol. This allowed the periodic reduction, hence, refreshing of Pt, ensuring stable, continuous operation for 5 h.

Zeolite-catalyzed polyethylene (PE) aromatization achieves reduction of the aromatic yield via hydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions. The hydrogen required for CO2 hydrogenation can be provided by H radicals formed during aromatization. In this study, we efficiently convert PE and CO2 into aromatics and CO using a zeolite-metal oxide catalyst (HZSM-5 + CuZnZrOx) at 380°C and under hydrogen- and solvent-free reaction conditions. Hydrogen, derived from the aromatization of PE over HZSM-5, diffuses through the Brønsted acidic sites of the zeolite to the adjacent CuZnZrOx, where it is captured in situ by CO2 to produce bicarbonate and further hydrogenated to CO. This favors aromatization while inhibiting hydrogenation and secondary hydrogenolysis reactions. An aromatic yield of 62.5 wt % is achieved, of which 60% consisted of benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX). The conversion of CO2 reaches values as high as 0.55 mmol gPE-1. This aromatization-hydrogen capture pathway provides a feasible scheme for the comprehensive utilization of waste plastics and CO2.

The concept of sector coupling is gaining international attention as a means to drive further decarbonization. Our study develops and simulates 27 sector coupling technology combinations based on assumptions derived from the literature and then evaluates their efficacy in meeting Germany's CO2 emission targets for 2030, 2045, and 2050, respectively. Our findings reveal that only ambitious technological pathways involving disruptive innovations in multiple sectors offer realistic pathways for achieving the country's decarbonization targets. Using a scoring system that incorporates technical and socioeconomic indicators, we reveal the relation between reductions in CO2 emissions and multi-criteria-based scores assigned to specific sector coupling scenarios. Our results favor emission reductions from both a socio-economic perspective and a purely economic one, and they highlight the benefits of disruptive sectoral linkages in achieving emission reduction targets. Nevertheless, none of the technology combinations analyzed here meet the more ambitious German emission targets set in 2021.

This work employs a combination of density functional theory-infrared (IR), conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS), and molecular dynamic (MD) methods to investigate the impact of hydroxyl functional groups on CO2 capture within dicationic ionic liquids (DILs). The COSMO-RS reveals that hydroxyl groups in DILs reduce the macroscopic solubility of CO2 but improve the selectivity of CO2 over CO, H2, and CH4 gases. Quantum methods in the gas phase and MD simulations in the liquid phase were conducted to delve deeper into the underlying mechanisms. The IR spectrum analysis confirms red shifts in CO2's asymmetric stretching mode and blue shifts in the CR-HR bond of the dication, indicating CO2-DIL interactions and the weakening of the anion-cation interactions caused by the presence of CO2. The results show that the positioning of anions around hydroxyl groups and HR atoms in rings inhibits the proximity of CO2 molecules, causing the hydrogen atoms within methylene groups to accumulate CO2. van der Waals forces were found to dominate the interaction between ions and CO2. The addition of hydroxyl groups strengthens the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds between dications and anions. The stronger interaction energy between ions in [C5(mim)2-(C2)2(OH)2][NTf2]2 limits the displacement of CO2 molecules within this DIL compared to [C5(mim)2-(C4)2][NTf2]2. Compared to [C5(mim)2-(C4)2][NTf2]2, [C5(mim)2-(C2)2(OH)2][NTf2]2 exhibits stronger ion-ion interactions, higher density, and reduced free volume, resulting in a reduction in CO2 capture. These results provide significant insights into the intermolecular interactions and vibrational properties of CO2 in DIL complexes, emphasizing their significance in developing efficient and sustainable strategies for CO2 capture.

Road transport is one of the main causes of air pollution around the world. Nowadays, the notion of sustainable development is one of the major pillars for a healthy environment. However, faced with its major challenges, it is more than necessary and important to understand a set of elements which contribute to better understanding the level of planning for sustainable road transport. This study aims to estimate energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions, namely from road transport, for the city of Douala in Cameroon from 2010 to 2035. In order to achieve our objective, we used the Long range Energy Alternative Planning (LEAP) model. Based on the LEAP model, the estimates were evaluated based on three scenarios Business As Usual (BAU), Energy Optimization and Mitigation (EOM) and Sustainability Mobility (SM). The aim of this work was to identify suitable potential policies with a view to reducing energy consumption and emissions carbon dioxide () for road transport in Douala. The results tell us that the EOM and SM scenarios have advantages over the BAU scenario with the SM scenario being more optimistic than the other two scenarios. In addition, the SM scenario has a growth rate of 87.408 % in energy demand smaller than the other two scenarios BAU and EOM respectively 151.598 % and 132.073 %. We also note that the SM scenario contributed to a reduction of 60.661 kilo ton emissions of less than the BAU scenario. At present, with a view to reducing energy consumption and reducing carbon emissions, road vehicles in circulation in the city of Douala should emphasize structural optimization measures through the use of clean energy by promoting the use of biofuels in mass transport, eliminating old cars and finally considering improving energy efficiency through the implementation of technological development in the automobile sector. Policy makers must take this study into consideration in order to better integrate the notion of energy sustainable road transport.

This study explores the stability of electrodeposited copper catalysts utilized in electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) across various amine media. The focus is on understanding the influence of different amine types, corrosion ramifications, and the efficacy of pulse ECR methodologies. Employing a suite of electrochemical techniques including potentiodynamic polarization, linear resistance polarization, cyclic voltammetry, and chronopotentiometry, the investigation reveals useful insights. The findings show that among the tested amines, CO2-rich monoethanolamine (MEA) exhibits the highest corrosion rate. However, in most cases, the rates remain within tolerable limits for ECR operations. Primary amines, notably monoethanolamine (MEA), show enhanced compatibility with ECR processes, attributable to their resistance against carbonate salt precipitation and sustained stability over extended durations. Conversely, tertiary amines such as methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) present challenges due to the formation of carbonate salts during ECR, impeding their effective utilization. This study highlights the effectiveness of pulse ECR strategies in stabilizing ECR. A noticeable shift in cathodic potential and reduced deposit formation on the catalyst surface through periodic oxidation underscores the efficacy of such strategies. These findings offer insights for optimizing ECR in amine media, thereby providing promising pathways for advancements in CO2 emission reduction technologies.

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to value-added products provides a feasible pathway for mitigating net carbon emissions and storing renewable energy. However, the low dimerization efficiency of the absorbed CO intermediate (*CO) and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction hinder the selective electroreduction of CO2 to ethane (C2H6) with a high energy density. Here, we designed hydrophobic iodide-derived copper electrodes (I–Cu/Nafion) for reducing CO2 to C2H6. The Faradaic efficiency of C2H6 reached 23.37% at −0.7 V vs RHE over the I–Cu/Nafion electrode in an H-type cell, which was about 1.7 times higher than that of the I–Cu electrode. The hydrophobic properties of the I–Cu/Nafion electrodes led to an increase in the local CO2 concentration and stabilized the Cu+ species. In situ Raman characterizations and density functional theory calculations indicate that the enhanced performances could be ascribed to the strong *CO adsorption and decreased the formation energy of *COOH and *COCOH intermediates. This study highlights the effect of the hydrophobic surface on Cu-based catalysts in the electroreduction of CO2 and provides a promising way to adjust the selectivity of C2 products.

As main by-product in iron and steel industry, high value-added utilization of blast furnace slag had received extensive attention. In this paper, a novelty technology was proposed for using blast furnace slag as raw material to obtain excellent CO2 adsorbent-layered double oxides. The characteristics of layered double hydroxides and layered double oxides were investigated in detailed. Most notably, the laminate structure of layered double hydroxides collapsed and the pore structure, particle size distribution and functional groups of the sample had been greatly changed. The layered double oxides were occupied by phases of CaO, Ca12Al14O32Cl2 and MgO. The transformation mechanism of the layered double oxides preparation was obtained. In addition, CO2 concentration and temperature influencing on CO2 adsorption of layered double oxides were studied and established a suitable kinetic model. The optimal kinetic mechanism model of CO2 adsorption by layered double oxides was PSO. The activation energy and pre-exponential factors were 56.88 kJ‧mol-1 and 12.26 min-1, respectively. Ultimately, CO2 adsorption capacity comparison and preliminary economic evaluation were conducted to assess the industrial feasibility of this technology. This work achieved the goals between CO2 reduction and high value-added utilization of solid waste in iron and steel industry.

The tandem application of CO2 electrolysis with syngas fermentation holds promise for achieving heightened production rates and improved product quality. However, the significant impact of syngas composition on mixed culture-based microbial chain elongation remains unclear. Additionally, effective methods for generating syngas with an adjustable composition from acidic CO2 electrolysis are currently lacking. This study successfully demonstrated the production of medium-chain fatty acids from CO2 through tandem acidic electrolysis with syngas fermentation. CO could serve as the sole energy source or as the electron donor (when cofed with acetate) for caproate generation. Furthermore, the results of gas diffusion electrode structure engineering highlighted that the use of carbon black, either alone or in combination with graphite, enabled consistent syngas generation with an adjustable composition from acidic CO2 electrolysis (pH 1). The carbon black layer significantly improved the CO selectivity, increasing from 0% to 43.5% (0.05 M K+) and further to 92.4% (0.5 M K+). This enhancement in performance was attributed to the promotion of K+ accumulation, stabilizing catalytically active sites, rather than creating a localized alkaline environment for CO2-to-CO conversion. This research contributes to the advancement of hybrid technology for sustainable CO2 reduction and chemical production.

Irrigation is a land management practice with major environmental impacts. However, global energy consumption and carbon emissions resulting from irrigation remain unknown. We assess the worldwide energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with irrigation, while also measuring the potential energy and carbon reductions achievable through the adoption of efficient and low-carbon irrigation practices. Currently, irrigation contributes 216 million metric tons of CO2 emissions and consumes 1896 petajoules of energy annually, representing 15% of greenhouse gas emissions and energy utilized in agricultural operations. Despite only 40% of irrigated agriculture relies on groundwater sources, groundwater pumping accounts for 89% of the total energy consumption in irrigation. Projections indicate that future expansion of irrigation could lead to a 28% increase in energy usage. Embracing highly efficient, low-carbon irrigation methods has the potential to cut energy consumption in half and reduce CO2 emissions by 90%. However, considering country-specific feasibility of mitigation options, global CO2 emissions may only see a 55% reduction. Our research offers comprehensive insights into the energy consumption and carbon emissions associated with irrigation, contributing valuable information that can guide assessments of the viability of irrigation in enhancing adaptive capacity within the agricultural sector.

Spain is among the 11 virtuous European countries that achieved the 2020 European targets, including the reduction of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, as well as the implementation of renewable energy. Yet, about 250 Mtons CO2 equivalent were still emitted in 2020 and is out of the question that the current efforts are not sufficient to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. This Policy Brief aims to describe the current situation, critically analyze the trends, and give recommendations to the policy makers based on the ten-year experience of our group on CO2 emissions research.

In the framework of the RECCAP2 initiative, we present the greenhouse gas (GHG) and carbon (C) budget of Europe. For the decade of the 2010s, we present a bottom-up (BU) estimate of GHG net-emissions of 3.9 Pg CO2-eq. yr-1 (global warming potential on 100 year horizon), and are largely dominated by fossil fuel emissions. In this decade, terrestrial ecosystems are a net GHG sink of 0.9 Pg CO2-eq. yr-1, dominated by a CO2 sink. For CH4 and N2O, we find good agreement between BU and top-down (TD) estimates from atmospheric inversions. However, our BU land CO2 sink is significantly higher than TD estimates. We further show that decadal averages of GHG net-emissions have declined by 1.2 Pg CO2-eq. yr-1 since the 1990s, mainly due to a reduction in fossil fuel emissions. In addition, based on both data driven BU and TD estimates, we also find that the land CO2 sink has weakened over the past two decades. In particular, we identified a decreasing sink strength over Scandinavia, which can be attributed to an intensification of forest management. These are partly offset by increasing CO2 sinks in parts of Eastern Europe and Northern Spain, attributed in part to land use change. Extensive regions of high CH4 and N2O emissions are mainly attributed to agricultural activities and are found in Belgium, the Netherlands and the southern UK. We further analyzed interannual variability in the GHG budgets. The drought year of 2003 shows the highest net-emissions of CO2 and of all GHGs combined.

Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) has emerged as a promising field for solar energy conversion, water splitting, CO2 reduction, and environmental remediation. Various modification methods have been developed to enhance PEC performance, with single-atomic catalysts (SACs) gaining attention for their potential to improve efficiency. SACs consist of isolated metal atoms dispersed on a support material, providing high atom utilization efficiency and well-defined active sites. Incorporating SACs into photoelectrodes has shown significant improvements in charge carrier dynamics and catalytic activity. This review comprehensively analyzes recent advancements in PEC, focusing on the role of SACs in standalone photoanodes, photocathodes, and dual-function photoelectrodes. It explores their impact on water splitting, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, detection, and sensing. This comprehensive review paper provides a valuable resource for researchers in the field of PEC by addressing existing gaps and incorporating the latest research progress. With its up-to-date analysis and comprehensive coverage, this review also contributes to the development of efficient and sustainable PEC devices.

Coated Titanium Anodes (CTAs) exhibit significant potential in addressing the high energy consumption challenge inherent in current manganese electrowinning processes. However, the electrodeposition of manganese dioxide (MnO2) at the anode limits the utilization of CTAs in conventional manganese electrolytic cells. Herein, a novel H+ exchange membrane (HEM) electrolytic cell was proposed and applied to manganese electrowinning employing Ti/IrO2 − RuO2 − SiO2 anode. The HEM electrolytic cell is a three-chamber electrolytic reactor consisting of cathode chamber, acidification chamber and anode chamber separated by woven terylene diaphragm and HEM. The results indicated that after 24 h of electrowinning, the cathodic current efficiency (CE) of 85.1 % was achieved, along with a specific energy consumption (EC) of 4189 kW·h/t. Compared to conventional industrial electrowinning technology, this represents an increase in CE by more than 15 % and a reduction in EC by over 1400 kW·h/t. The unique structure of the HEM electrolytic cell effectively prevents MnO2 deposition, ensuring the functionality of the CTAs and eliminating the generation of anode mud. Additionally, the H+ from the oxygen evolution reaction at the anode is collected and concentrated in the acidification chamber. This resulted in a spent electrolyte with 15.2 g/L H2SO4, enabling its reuse in extracting manganese ores. Employing the HEM electrolytic cell with a Ti/IrO2 − RuO2 − SiO2 anode for manganese electrowinning is therefore considered an energy-efficient and clean approach. It is highly recommended for saving energy and reducing carbon emissions in industrial processes.

Insufficient surface catalytic sites and charge kinetics constrains the progress of CO2 photoreduction reaction. In this work, oxygen vacancy-enriched Ag/brookite TiO2 hybrid by anchoring Ag nanoparticles on brookite TiO2 has been synthesized through the transformation of Ti-glycerol precursor with simultaneous reduction of Ag+ in the diethylene glycol (DEG)-H2O solution. In particular, the involving of oxygen vacancy and Ag species could extend light absorption range, facilitate charge separation and transfer, and accumulate the electrons on Ag center. As a result, the Ag/brookite TiO2 with formed Schottky junction reveals enhanced CO2 photoreduction performance compare with pristine TiO2 and solvothermal treated TiO2 (TiO2-sol). Particularly, the oxygen vacancy-enriched Ag/TiO2 hybrid shows the highest catalytic activity with CH4 and CO yields. This work offers an approach to modify brookite phase TiO2 with metallic sites and oxygen vacancy for improved CO2 photoreduction.

Summary Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an important practice for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. However, accurately monitoring carbon storage operations using simulations can be challenging due to data availability, subsurface complexity, uncertainty, and computational cost. Machine learning can help to address these challenges by providing cheaper data-driven approaches. For instance, Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CCGAN) can be used to predict CO2 plume propagation with sparsely available data. This model enables fast prediction with reasonable accuracy and a substantial reduction in computational cost when compared to numerical simulations. Another approach, Barlow Twins (BT), provides better results than other deep learning-based approaches and comparable results to traditional methods for linear subspace and nonlinear manifold problems. In this work, we compare the accuracy of predictions of CO2 plume propagation based on data from three well locations using a BT-based approach to those obtained with the CCGAN. Our findings suggest that BT-based approaches could be a viable option for data-driven simulation of CO2 plume propagation in the subsurface when data is limited.

PHOX2B is a transcription factor essential for the development of different classes of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system. Heterozygous mutations in the PHOX2B coding region are responsible for the occurrence of Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS), a rare neurological disorder characterised by inadequate chemosensitivity and life-threatening sleep- related hypoventilation. Animal studies suggest that chemoreflex defects are caused in part by the improper development or function of PHOX2B expressing neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a central hub for CO2 chemosensitivity.Although the function of PHOX2B in rodents during development is well established, its role in the adult respiratory network remains unknown. In this study, we investigated whether reduction in PHOX2B expression in chemosensitive neuromedin-B (NMB) expressing neurons in the RTN altered respiratory function. Four weeks following local RTN injection of a lentiviral vector expressing the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Phox2b mRNA, a reduction of PHOX2B expression was observed in Nmb neurons compared to both naïve rats and rats injected with the non-target shRNA. PHOX2B knockdown did not affect breathing in room air or under hypoxia, but ventilation was significantly impaired during hypercapnia. PHOX2B knockdown did not alter Nmb expression but it was associated with reduced the expression of both Task2 and Gpr4, two CO2 sensors in the RTN. We conclude that PHOX2B in the adult brain has an important role in CO2 chemoreception and reduced PHOX2B expression in CCHS beyond the developmental period may contribute to the impaired central chemoreflex function.

In this study, we investigated whether reduction in PHOX2B expression in chemosensitive neuromedin-B (NMB) expressing neurons in the RTN altered respiratory function. Four weeks following local RTN injection of a lentiviral vector expressing the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Phox2b mRNA, a reduction of PHOX2B expression was observed in Nmb neurons compared to both naïve rats and rats injected with the non-target shRNA. PHOX2B knockdown did not affect breathing in room air or under hypoxia, but ventilation was significantly impaired during hypercapnia. PHOX2B knockdown did not alter Nmb expression but it was associated with reduced the expression of both Task2 and Gpr4, two CO2 sensors in the RTN. We conclude that PHOX2B in the adult brain has an important role in CO2 chemoreception and reduced PHOX2B expression in CCHS beyond the developmental period may contribute to the impaired central chemoreflex function.

Controlled-release urea (CRU) fertilizers are widely used in agricultural production to reduce conventional nitrogen (N) fertilization-induced agricultural greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) and improve N use efficiency (NUE). However, the long-term effects of different CRU fertilizers on GHGs and crop yields in vegetable fields remain relatively unexplored. This study investigated the variations in GHG emissions at four growth stages of lettuce in the spring and autumn seasons based on a five-year field experiment in the North China Plain. Four treatments were setup: CK (without N application), U (conventional urea—N application), ON (20% reduction in urea—N application), CRU (20% reduction in polyurethane-coated urea without topdressing), and DCRU (20% reduction in polyurethane-coated urea containing dicyandiamide [DCD] without topdressing). The results show that N application treatments significantly increased the GHG emissions and the lettuce yield and net yield, and DCRU exhibited the lowest N2O and CO2 emissions, the highest lettuce yield and net yield, and the highest lettuce N content of the N application treatments. When compared to U, the N2O emission peak under CRU and DCRU treatments was notably decreased and delayed, and their average N2O emission fluxes were significantly reduced by 10.20–20.72% and 17.51–29.35%, respectively, leading to a significant reduction in mean cumulative N2O emissions during the 2017–2021 period. When compared to U, the CO2 fluxes of DCRU significantly decreased by 8.0–16.54% in the seedling period, and mean cumulative CO2 emission decreased by 9.28%. Moreover, compared to U, the global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) of the DCRU treatment was significantly alleviated by 9.02–17.13% and 16.68–20.36%, respectively. Compared to U, the N content of lettuce under DCRU was significantly increased by 6.48–17.25%, and the lettuce net yield was also significantly increased by 5.41–7.71%. These observations indicated that the simple and efficient N management strategy to strike a balance between enhancing lettuce yields and reduce GHG emissions in open-field lettuce fields could be obtained by applying controlled-release urea containing DCD without topdressing.

A greenhouse gas emission reduction effect of “Low-Carbon Products” which are the second scheme of Korean carbon footprint labeling has been analyzed from 2011 to 2015 in this study. The reduction effect is calculated by subtracting the low carbon product from the first carbon emission which shows the reduced emission value of product and then multiplying by the sales of the products. The total number of the low-carbon products is 231 and its estimated reducing GHG effect totals 3.44 Mt CO2-eq. This equals to an annual absorption of approximately 520 million 30 year old pine trees and an annual emission of about 1.43 million vehicles. In addition, it is evaluated that the cost effectiveness of a low carbon product labeling program is more than 50 times than that of carbon trading schemes in Korea. Both the government and companies should develope and apply various policies to invigorate the program of low carbon products.

Three novel conjugated porous organic polymers, denoted as C-POP1-3 and which consist of alternating pyrene cores with various contorted fluorene surrogates, were successfully synthesized from a versatile one-pot palladium-catalyzed [3+2] cyclocondensation reaction. The resulting polymers were obtained in excellent yields and displayed weight-average molecular weights (Mw) ranging from 12.2 to 20.2 kg/mol with polydispersity indices (Mw/Mn) ranging between 1.8 and 2.4, suggesting that the molecular masses are narrowly distributed and thus implying homogeneous polymer chains. Thermal stability exploration of C-POP1-3 by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed an impressive robustness with a 10% weight reduction temperature attaining 485 °C. Investigation of the inherent microporosity properties of C-POP1-3 via nitrogen adsorption experiments using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory discloses their surface areas which reach up to 560 m2 g-1 and pore volumes averaging 0.47 cm3 g-1. The target conjugated polymers were explored as adsorbents disclosing a maximum carbon dioxide adsorption of 83.0 mg g-1 at 273 K and low pressure for C-POP1, whereas iodine sorption tests portrayed prominent outcomes, notably for C-POP3 which proved to owe a strong affinity toward the hitherto mentioned halogen by achieving a maximum adsorption of 2220 mg g-1. Additionally, recyclability experiments confirmed the possibility to regenerate the polymers' adsorption capabilities even after seven consecutive cycles of adsorption-desorption cycles, which qualify them as auspicious iodine adsorbents.

Cement is one of the widely used materials in construction, and its production is both energy- and emission-intensive, contributing significantly to industrial emissions. This study investigates multiple methods for reducing emissions in the Indian cement sector based on the mass and energy balances of a representative cement plant. A novel methodology for calculating the overall emissions reduction per tonne of cement with multiple emission reduction measures and their interdependencies is proposed. The effect of captive power plants in the cement industry on emissions reduction is also considered. The results are depicted using an emission abatement curve, which gives the CO2 abatement cost against cumulative emission reduction per tonne of cement, and a cost premium curve, which shows the cumulative abatement cost against percentage abatement. The analysis shows that up to 30% emissions reduction is possible using existing emission reduction measures in all the cases considered with no additional cost, and near-zero emission reduction is only possible with the adoption of emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage. The proposed methodology is the first to explore the impact of multiple measures for emission reduction on a given cement plant, allowing for a realistic estimate of emission reduction from the measures implemented.

A novel hybrid energy system driven by torrefied biomass gasification and solar energy is proposed for the first time, and their complementarity to enhance the system's energy efficiency is analyzed and shown. The system mainly combines biomass torrefaction, biomass gasification subsystem, solar heat collection and absorption refrigeration technology. The effects of different operating parameters on the gasification products were studied. The economic analysis is carried out based on the theory of exergy economy. The results show that torrefaction pretreatment of biomass can significantly improve its fuel quality and gasification performance. With the increase of torrefied temperature, the volume fraction of CO2 and H2 decreased while the volume fraction of CH4 and CO increased. The economic analysis shows that the expected annual income is $72,735, and the investment recovery period is 2.89 years. Through the calculation of the energy-saving and environmental benefits, it can be concluded that the hybrid energy system can save 1.05 × 106 MJ of heat per year. This equates to about 358.26 tons of standard coal or a CO2 emission reduction of 550.59 tons, the participation of solar energy is conducive to the system emission reduction. By tuning the parameter sensitivity, the influence of biomass price change on the unit exergy cost of system products was more obvious.

2,6-xylenol and p-cresol are widely used in medicine synthesis, which are both important raw materials in chemical engineering. It is shown significant economic benefits to separate 2,6-xylenol and p-cresol. Owing to the extremely relative volatility between 2,6-xylenol and p-cresol, it is difficult to separate the two phenolic compounds through conventional distillation. The results of vapor–liquid equilibrium analysis, COSMO-SAC and reduced density gradient result are used to investigate molecular interaction in the separation system, indicating diethylene glycol (DEG) as the optimal solvent. Accordingly, we propose an energy-saving extractive distillation process with DEG as an efficient entrainer for the separation of 2,6-xylenol and p-cresol. Total annual cost (TAC) and CO2 emission are investigated for optimization and estimation of the proposed process. In addition, three energy-saving scenarios for further reductions in TAC and CO2 emission are proposed. Compared with the benchmark process, the TAC and CO2 emission of the energy-saving design vapor recompression heat pump assisted extractive distillation separation sequence B are reduced by 26.18 % and 49.18 %, respectively, which indicates that the considerable industrial potential of the proposed design.

Gallium oxide‐based catalysts are promising candidates for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, whilst mechanistic understanding of the catalytic systems is not yet fully understood. Here, transient in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) studies of CO2 hydrogenation over the unsupported CuGa and CuGaN (with N doping) catalysts were conducted. The findings show that N doping could possibly promote the formation of surface Cu+ sites on the interface between Cu and Ga2O3, and hence increasing the selectivity to methanol. However, N doping prohibited the reduction of Ga2O3 to oxygen‐deficient Ga2O3‐x, which is unfavorable for CO2 conversion. Additionally, during DRIFTS the steady‐state isotope transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) was performed (under H2/D2 isotopic switching conditions). The SSITKA results confirm that the Cu+‐bound formates were likely the key intermediates for methanol synthesis over the catalyst, and the N doping could also weak the interaction between CO* species and the catalyst surface, and thus facilitating the selectivity towards methanol rather than CO. Findings of the work show that the partial nitridation of the metal oxides could be the strategy to promote methanol synthesis selectivity.

A growing body of life cycle assessment (LCA) data desribes the environmental impact of healthcare processes. Objectives: To apply existing GHG emissions estimates to the bladder cancer pathway, To adapt GHG emissions data to accurately represent 2023 practice in the UK, To identify and quantify ways to reduce GHG emissions in England. METHODS: A scientific reference group comprised of healthcare environmental impact assessment experts was convened. Expert knowledge and literature review identified evidence describing ways to reduce GHG emissions across the bladder cancer care pathway, from referral to definitive treatment. Practice recommendations likely to result in equivalent or superior patient care, with lower GHG emissions, were made. Potential nationwide GHG emissions reductions were estimated based on incident numbers derived from Hospital Episode Statistics. RESULTS: Sixty eight recommendations were made. A national annual GHG emissions reduction of 3,690 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) was modelled as being possible if UK practice were optimised. This is equivalent to driving 17 million km in an average UK petrol car. The top 14 recommendations comprised 93% of modelled potential GHG emissions reductions, and are summarised in Table 1. CONCLUSIONS: Urology services can rapidly and substantially reduce GHG emissions associated with bladder cancer care, by adopting an array of pragmatic evidenced-based recommendations. Our approach to quantifying potential GHG emissions reductions allows healthcare services to be able to prioritise the most important adaptations. Replicating and implementing this approach internationally could yield substantial GHG eminssions reductions. Further LCA research and incorporation of circular economy principles into healthcare will continue to identify means of further GHG emissions reductions.

The Mountain Pass mine is recognized as one of the world's primary sources of rare earth minerals. These rare earth minerals mainly consist of bastnaesite and a small amount of monazite phosphate, which cannot be decomposed and recovered through conventional oxidative roasting and hydrochloric acid leaching process. An efficient, clean, and economical process called the "combined method" was proposed for the utilization of the Mountain Pass mine to extract rare earths from Mountain Pass rare earth concentrate (MPREC). The main steps of this process include weak oxidation atmosphere roasting, step leaching of hydrochloric acid, solid-liquid separation, the monazite slag with sulfuric acid roasting water leaching, etc. In this paper, the roasting process of MPREC under a weak oxidation atmosphere was investigated. The study examines the thermal decomposition kinetics, phase transition process, and leaching behavior of MPREC in air/CO2 atmosphere. Results show that, the activation energy (Ea) for MPREC thermal decomposition in air and CO2 atmosphere are 146 and 320 kJ/mol, respectively. At temperature above 500 °C in air or above 700 °C in CO2 atmosphere, REOF are generated from bastnaesite through an in-situ reaction with CaO, which is decomposed from CaCO3, to form CaF2 and rare earth oxide (REO). Thus, F is regulated into solid phase. In an oxidizing atmosphere, the thermal decomposition of bastnaesite is accompanied by the rapid oxidation of Ce(Ⅲ). In contrast, the oxidation of Ce(Ⅲ) in a CO2 atmosphere is significantly inhibited. At 700 °C, the oxidation rate of Ce in air is 74.09%, while in a CO2 atmosphere, it is only 33.83%. The hydrochloric acid leaching experiment shows that, the leaching rate of rare earth after roasting at 600 °C under an air atmosphere reaches to 82.9%, and it reaches 87% after roasting at 800 °C under a CO2 atmosphere. The reduction of Ce oxidation in a weak oxidizing atmosphere significantly improves the leaching rate of Ce.

Acidic CO2 electroreduction has the potential to synthesize low carbon footprint chemicals using renewable electricity. However, proton-rich environments can lead to strong hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and severe degradation of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance. Modulating electrode structure plays a critical role in improving the local microenvironment of CO2RR electrolytes. Here, by covering the catalyst layer with a hydrophobic silica aerosol layer, the surface of the catalyst is protected from corrosion, thereby increasing the efficiency and stability of the system. In the flow cell, the Sn-C/SiO2-3 catalyst has high formic acid (HCOOH) selectivity at high current density (∼90 % at −400 mA cm−2). Importantly, the Sn-C/SiO2-3 catalyst can operate stably for 45 h at −400 mA cm−2. Combined in situ infrared analysis reveals that hydrophobic SiO2 aerosol layer can engineer the local microenvironment over the Sn-C catalyst surface by increasing the coverage of *OCHO to improve the CO2RR, which ultimately promotes high-efficiency CO2 conversion to HCOOH in strong acidic media. This surface coating strategy for adjusting the interface microenvironment can also be used for other electrocatalytic reactions.

Spilling has already occurred as a result of rising the penetration of intermittent renewable generation, and it is anticipated that the level of renewable energy curtailment will continue to soar. This leads to an increase in operating costs, CO2 emissions, and not good utilization of renewable energy resources. A bi-level multi-objective optimization model is proposed in this paper to reduce wind power spillage (WPS) based on demand response (DR) and dynamic thermal line rating (DTLR). In the upper level, multiple objectives will be satisfied based on the optimal allocation and time of DR programs considering DTLR obtained in the lower level. The minimization of WPS, load shedding, power losses, and CO2 emissions are the objectives of this level. While the lower-level aims to maximize social welfare under different scenarios and overall system constraints. Under the uncertainty of the wind power and load demand, a collection of lower-level problems that represent the market clearing conditions is used to constrain the upper-level. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is examined on a modified two-area IEEE 24-bus test system. Results depict that the suggested bi-level model enables considerable reductions in the WPS by up to 32.7 %. Also, there is an enhancement in load shedding, power losses, and CO2 emissions by 28.93 %, 23.07 %, and 13.9 % respectively. Finally, the social welfare increased by up to 36.6 %.

The work analyzes the rights of future generations in a perspective of solidarity within Italian-European environmental law, in a similar way to what was done in the German legal system. The analysis is conducted through a survey of the Italian-European regulatory framework, also with specific reference to the objectives of European social policies and through the jurisprudential comparative analysis with the legal system of the Federal Republic of Germany. In particular, with specific reference to a recent environmental dispute brought before the German Constitutional Court (Case Neubauer, et all v. Germany), within which the rights of future generations to live in a healthy environment are recognized. In the aforementioned case, the complainants allege that the German government has not introduced a legal framework sufficient to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and has not limited the increase in global temperature, according to the parameters agreed in the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. The ruling of the German Constitutional Court is relevant since it considers it inadequate to achieve the objectives set by the international obligations on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions assumed by the federal law on climate protection of 2019. The aforementioned law is considered partly unconstitutional because it does not sufficiently protect people from future violations and limitations of the rights of freedom following the gradual intensification of climate change. In particular, in a perspective of solidarity, in a not local but global conception of the environment, with the recognition of the progressive and dangerous climate change, the German Constitutional Court notes that the German legislator has not distributed the CO2 emission balance proportionally and therefore, an adequate distribution of the sacrifice among current and future generations. In particular, the German Court writes: "one generation must not be allowed to consume large portions of the CO2 balance by supporting a relatively smaller share of the reduction effort, if this would leave subsequent generations with a drastic reduction burden and expose their lives to serious losses of liberty". The European and sometimes national regulatory framework still appears to be unsatisfactory with respect to the sustainable development objectives. So, the task of the national courts is that, as in the case of the German Constitutional Court, to evaluate the national regulatory provisions on climate protection, in the light of the principle of solidarity towards future generations, adopting an environmental approach that is not limited in time and in space but global.

Air leak syndrome, including pneumomediastinum (PM), pneumopericardium, pneumothorax, or subcutaneous emphysema, is primarily caused by chest trauma, cardiothoracic surgery, esophageal perforation, and mechanical ventilation. Secondary pneumomediastinum (SP) is a rare complication, with a much lower incidence reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our patient was a 44-year-old nonsmoker male with a previous history of obesity (Body Mass Index [BMI] 35 kg/m2), hyperthyroidism, hypokinetic cardiopathy and atrial fibrillation in treatment with flecainide, who presented to the emergency department with 6 days of fever, cough, dyspnea, and respiratory distress. The COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed based on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). After initiation of mechanical ventilation, a chest computed tomography (CT) on the first day revealed bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities, consolidation and an extensive SP and pneumoperitoneum. Our therapeutic strategy was initiation of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) as a bridge to recovery after positioning 2 drains (mediastinal and pleural), for both oxygenation and carbon dioxide clearance, to allow protective and ultra-protective ventilation to limit ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and the intensity of mechanical power for lung recovery. After another chest CT scan which showed a clear reduction of the PM, 2 pronation and neuromuscular relaxation cycles were also required, with improvement of gas exchange and respiratory mechanics. On the 15th day, lung function recovered and the patient was then weaned from VV-ECMO, and ultimately made a good recovery and was discharged. In conclusion, SP may be a reflection of extensive alveolar damage and should be considered as a potential predictive factor for adverse outcome in critically ill SARS-CoV2 patients.

Two sets of Cu2+, and Co2+ complexes of two 4 – Pyridyl thiosemicarbazone derivatives ligands symbolized by (H3L1), and (H3L2), were synthesized and examined utilizing different analytical, and spectroscopic techniques such as (FT-IR, Elemental Analysis, Magnetic studies, PXRD, UV-Vis, and GC-MS). Thermal stability along with kinetic parameters of both Co2+ complexes were studied. 1H NMR technique was used to confirm the structures of both ligands. The proposed geometries of complexes were recognized by density function theory (DFT) calculations using Material software. Additionally, Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) topological analyses for both ligands were obtained using Multiwfn software. The cyclic voltammogram revealed that copper ions are electroactive and exhibited two reduction waves. Fluorescence studies for both ligands showed a direct increase in the intensity of emissions because of increasing Co2+ concentration in solution. Moreover, several biological evaluations were carried out for all six compounds to evaluate their potential use as biological agents, including antioxidant activity using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging approach, anti-microbial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans, DNA degradation activity, in addition to anticancer activity, along with molecular docking theoretical study against MCF-7 breast cancer cell line to determine the compounds ability to act as antitumor. It was found that the investigated compounds (especially the free ligands) have beneficial effects such as antimicrobial, antitumor, and DNA degradation agents. Furthermore, Co2+ complex (2) has the highest ABTS scavenging activity.

The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) of Indonesia in the Paris Agreement targeted emission reductions of 29% on its own and 41% with international cooperation in 2030, followed by Net Zero Emissions (NZE) in 2060. To achieve NZE, Indonesia enacted a carbon tax policy on April 1, 2022. The 2022–2024 carbon tax is limited to Steam Power Plants and will be imposed on other sectors by 2030. This research examines the ratio legis of carbon cost policies in Indonesia and compares the core of carbon tax policies in Indonesia with Sweden and Finland. Indonesia is starting to implement a Carbon Pricing policy under the ‘Cap-and-Tax’ scheme. The Cap scheme will be a means to force changes in the business culture in Indonesia, so the companies will pay attention to and reduce the carbon emission produced to avoid paying penalties for carbon exceeding the limits. Meanwhile, the Carbon Tax will provide economic resources to Indonesia to develop environmentally friendly technologies, fund research on renewable energy, and provide incentives for environmentally friendly businesses during the transition process to a carbon culture in Indonesia. Referring to the results of the comparison of carbon pricing policies in Finland and Sweden, Indonesia can gradually increase the cost of carbon taxes starting from Rp30,000/US$2 per ton CO2 equivalent to US$10 per ton CO2 equivalent. Meanwhile, for the imposition of high carbon tax rates, such as in Finland (US$73.02 per ton CO2 equivalent) and Sweden (US$137 per ton CO2 equivalent), Indonesia must carry out tax reforms, so the applied carbon tax is able to reduce carbon emissions without causing adverse impacts for the Indonesian economy.

With the increasing demand of passenger and freight air transportation and their key role in energy consumptions, this study developed a hybrid framework integrating machine learning algorithms to predict passenger and freight demand in air transportation and analyzed the impacts of the air transportation demand on energy consumption and CO2 emission. Critical variables are identified through correlation analyses between air transportation characteristics and economic, social, and environmental components, which are further selected to predict the air passenger and freight transportation demand. A hybrid framework is then developed where pairwise machine learning algorithms are developed to enhance prediction accuracy with an optimization model. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses are conducted to assess the effects of passenger and freight demand on energy consumption and CO2 emission. The framework is employed using Canadian air transportation as a case study. The pairwise machine learning algorithms are compared to single algorithm which increases prediction accuracy by 24.5% for passenger demand and by 25.85% for freight demand. It is predicted that the air passenger will increase by 94% to 94.25% and freight transportation demand will increase by 28.12% to 33.97% in 2050 relative to 2019 level. This surge can raise energy consumption and CO2 emission by 8.91% to 9.46% and 11.32% to 12.12% respectively. A 50% decrease in both air passenger and freight transport demand will result in a 5.43% reduction in energy consumption in Canada's transportation sector. Conversely, if demand increases by 50%, CO2 emissions will rise by 3.42% for air passenger transport and 3.67% for air freight transport. The predicted air transportation demand growth and trends can be used for capacity development and emission mitigations for sustainable planning and controls in passenger and freight demand in air transportation.

Abstract In this groundbreaking experimental study, examines the impact of copper oxide (CuO) and Titanium oxide (TiO2) nanoparticles on both emissions and performance of a 4.1.5 kW diesel engine fueled by waste cooking oil biodiesel. B20 test fuel blends fortified with 50 ppm concentrations of CuO and TiO2 nanoparticles, subjected to rigorous testing across diverse engine loads (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) while maintaining a constant speed of 1,500 rpm. Through meticulous evaluation of key performance metrics such as brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), coupled with the analysis of emissions including CO, CO2, HC, and NOx, we observed remarkable enhancements. Notably, the introduction of 50 ppm copper oxide and titanium oxide nanoparticles into biodiesel blends resulted in a notable boost in brake power (BP) and BTE, showcasing a remarkable surge from 12.39% to 22.14% in BP and 4.92% to 15% in BTE, underscoring their profound impact of particular significance, B2050CuO exhibited superior combustion characteristics compared to titanium nanoparticles, leading to elevated flame temperature and reduced ignition delay, thereby translating into improved engine performance, enhanced braking power output, and overall superior brake thermal efficiency. Furthermore, CuO and TiO2 nanoparticle blends demonstrated a significant reduction in CO emissions at full load with a 50 ppm dosage, achieving reductions of 6.32%, 8.57%, and 6.25%, respectively. Moreover, for B20 and B2050 TiO2 blends, HC emissions saw a notable drop by 9.14%, 6.57%, and 2.817%, promoting efficient combustion through enhanced fuel molecule interaction. Comparatively, the inclusion of B20, B2050TiO2, and B2050CuO fuel blends led to substantial reductions in CO2 levels by 14.4%, 4.8%, and 3.75%, along with lowered NOx emissions by 5.2%, 3.125%, and 2%, highlighting their potential in mitigating environmental impact."

Trauma continues to be noted in studies as a risk factor for autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Successful therapeutic interventions that support the reduction of numbing episodes associated with MS may include diet, stress reduction techniques, and biofield therapy.This case report highlights the successful reduction of numbing episodes, stress, and fatigue in an individual 38-year-old Caucasian female patient using nutrition and body-mind-spirit practices. This individual continued conventional interventions while starting medical nutrition therapy. Over the course of 120 days, her treatment was augmented with a Paleolithic-style diet, which eliminated dairy and ultra-processed foods. Other dietary recommendations suggested were the increase of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), decrease of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), and increase in protein and CO2-promoting foods. Integrative recommendations were biofield therapy and for stress reduction were psychotherapy, reduced exercise intensity, lifestyle recovery from trauma, body-mind-spirit practices, and herbal supplementation.Integrative therapies such as diet, stress reduction techniques, and biofield therapy may be used as therapeutic protocols for trauma-induced MS patients. Population-based clinical studies should be done to understand the role of these therapies in synchronization.

CO2 methanation is an effective way for CO2 recycling, and nickel-based catalysts have attracted much attention in this field due to their excellent CH4 selectivity and cost-effectiveness; however, their applications are limited by their suboptimal catalytic activity. In this work, the catalytic activity of Ni-rutile-based catalysts was increased by almost an order of magnitude simply by doping the rutile with Fe. Series characterizations show that three factors that mainly contributed to the improved catalytic performance of the Ni/Fe-Rutile, which are the reduction of the Ni size, the increase of the basic sites, and the inhibition of the encapsulation of the Ni particles by the support. With Fe doping, the OH and oxygen vacancies on the rutile surface were reduced, which made the support difficult to reduce and thus suppressed the encapsulation of Ni by the support. As a result, the number of exposed active sites on the Ni/Fe-Rutile which with a smaller Ni size was further successfully increased, and the catalytic activity was significantly improved. This study provides new ideas for the design of activity-enhanced supported catalysts from the perspective of tuning the metal-support interaction and may be applicable to other reducible oxide-supported metal catalysts.

This study provides a fundamental literature review of biomass characterisation and application for utilisation as a reducing agent and fuel in an integrated steelmaking process. This review contains and evaluates the existing literature concerning the properties of different biomass sources and available pre-treatment technologies for upgrading biomasses to have similar characteristics to fossil coal. The suitability of biofuels in different operating units including Brazilian mini blast furnaces, cokemaking, larger blast furnace injection, sintering and production of carbon composite agglomerates are analysed. There is a considerable opportunity to reduce CO2 emissions in the integrated steelmaking process by using biomass-based reducing agents. The literature reports that charcoal optimisation in the integrated steel plant can achieve reduction in net CO2 emissions of 31–57%, depending on the substitution rate. Although, some level of pre-treatment is also necessary for efficient use of biomass, the pre-treatment requirement will depend on the unit operation where the biomass material is added. Solid biofuels are considered the most suitable form of biomass-based reducing agents due to similarities in the physical properties with the injected coals; this will make coal replacement more straightforward and lower the costs required for plant modifications.

This study elucidates the environmental benefits and the supply dynamics of electric vehicle sharing (EVS) across various trip modes and purposes. A comprehensive survey involving 1,784 participants is carried out to gauge travelers' latent preferences to EVS. An integrated model of the structural equation modeling (SEM) and the partial proportional odds model (PPOM) is developed to identify the interactive relationships between EVS and other trip modes. A before-and-after analysis is conducted to unveil the environmental benefits of EVS across different trip modes and purposes, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). In particular, marginal effect analysis is performed to assess the environmental benefits and supply dynamics as EVS adoption levels vary. The findings highlight a remarkable reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Beijing due to EVS operations, amounting to reductions of 168,000 kgce and 406,000 kgCO2, respectively. This study provides policymakers with insights into EVS's environmental potentials and optimization recommendations.

Despite proven as effective in overcoming the limitations of low CO2 solubility and inefficient diffusion, traditional gas-diffusion electrodes used in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions (eCO2RR) still face challenges, such as flooding and salt precipitation, and thus exhibit insufficient efficiency and durability at high current densities. Herein, an integrated gas-penetrable electrode (GPE) is developed by interfacially growing dense N-doped carbon nanotubes, embedded with NiFe alloy nanoparticles, on the outer surface of a Ni hollow fiber (NiFe@NCNTs/Ni HF). Thanks to improved mass transfer and the abundance of well-established triphase reaction interfaces, the NiFe@NCNTs/Ni HF GPE exhibits a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of over 90% across a wide potential range of 240 mV. Furthermore, it displays significantly enhanced partial current density (jCO) of up to 171.7 mA cm–2 at −1.03 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Notably, this GPE maintains stable FECO and jCO values for 42 h. This work demonstrates an effective strategy for developing integrated GPEs for efficient eCO2RR by addressing the mass transfer limitation while achieving high efficiency and durability at high current densities.

Photoelectrochemical water splitting and CO2 reduction provide an attractive route to produce solar fuels while reducing the level of CO2 emissions. Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been extensively studied for this purpose in recent years due to their suitable optoelectronic properties. In this review, we survey the recent achievements in the field. After a brief introduction to photoelectrochemical (PEC) processes, we discussed the properties, synthesis, and application of MHPs in this context. We also survey the state-of-the-art findings regarding significant achievements in performance, and developments in addressing the major challenges of toxicity and instability toward water. Efforts have been made to replace the toxic Pb with less toxic materials like Sn, Ge, Sb, and Bi. The stability toward water has been also improved by using various methods such as compositional engineering, 2D/3D perovskite structures, surface passivation, the use of protective layers, and encapsulation. In the last part, considering the experience gained in photovoltaic applications, we provided our perspective for the future challenges and opportunities. We place special emphasis on the improvement of stability as the major challenge and the potential contribution of machine learning to identify the most suitable formulation for halide perovskites with desired properties.

To achieve the goals of carbon peak and carbon neutrality, Xinjiang, as an autonomous region in China with large energy reserves, should adjust its energy development and vigorously develop new energy sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) power. This study utilized data spatiotemporal variation in solar radiation from 1984 to 2016 to verify that Xinjiang is suitable for the development of PV power generation. Then, the averages of the solar radiation, sunshine duration, and other data in the period after 2000 were used to assess the suitability of Xinjiang, based on spatial principal component analysis (SPCA). Finally, the theoretical power generation potential, fossil fuel reduction, and CO2 emissions reduction were estimated. The results are as follows: (1) In terms of temporal variation, the solar radiation in Xinjiang decreased (1984–2002), increased (2002–2009), and decreased again (2009–2016), but the fluctuations were not statistically significant. In terms of spatial distribution, the Kunlun Mountains in southern Xinjiang had the highest solar radiation during the span of the study period. Hami and Turpan, in eastern Xinjiang, had sufficiently high and stable solar radiation. (2) The area in Xinjiang classed as highly suitable for solar PV power generation is about 87,837 km2, which is mainly concentrated in eastern Xinjiang. (3) In the situation where the construction of PV power plants in Xinjiang is fully developed, the theoretical potential of annual solar PV power generation in Xinjiang is approximately 8.57 × 106 GWh. This is equivalent to 2.59 × 109 tce of coal. Furthermore, 6.58 × 109 t of CO2 emissions can be reduced. PV power generation potential is approximately 27 times the energy consumption of Xinjiang in 2020. Through the suitability assessment and calculations, we found that Xinjiang has significant potential for PV systems.

The production of CaO for lime-based plaster and render generates 1.2 t CO2/t CaO, consumes 1.78 t CaCO3/t CaO. This research paper examines the environmental and economic performance of upcycling paper mill sludge (PMS) and carbide lime (CL) as replacements for hydrated lime (HL) in lime-based plasters production. For this, a new Cradle-to-Gate industrial-scale inventory is designed, upscaling recent lab-scale innovations, investigating PMS and CL treatment processes, followed by a Cradle-to-Grave scenario analysis. The results show that incorporating CL in the plaster yields better environmental and economic outcomes compared to PMS. The intermediate treatment for CL is cost-effective and has low carbon emissions. The upcycling of CL eliminates 100% of CO2 emissions, while PMS reduces emissions by 11%. The production of the traditional binder HL is more expensive than upcycling PMS (+69%) and CL (+65%), with carbon taxes accounting for 35%, 44% and 15% of production costs, respectively. The effect of an equilibrated carbon price to ensure fair market competition, considering the natural carbonation of lime (carbon credit) is discussed, and the cost assessment reveals a 47% and 54% reduction for upcycled plasters using PMS and CL, respectively, compared to traditional HL.

Fractional CO2 laser therapy may serve as a novel minimally invasive treatment for PD. The objective of the study is to evaluate changes in penile curvature and the safety of fractional CO2 laser therapy in subjects with chronic phase PD. METHODS: This was a single site non-randomized and open label study utilizing a fractional CO2 laser. Subjects underwent 3 treatment sessions every 6 weeks with a fractional CO2 device using low density settings. Topical triamcinolone was applied immediately after each treatment and a petroleum product was applied to the treated area 2-5x/day for a week. Between treatments, patients were required to perform at-home penile modeling three times daily. Penile curvature assessments were performed and self-reported questionnaires were collected at baseline, 24-weeks, and 52-week follow-up. Adverse events were assessed at each treatment and by self-reported diaries. RESULTS: There was a total of 5 patients included in the study. All study participants completed all of the follow up assessments. The median baseline penile curvature was 37° (range: 30° - 50°) and at the 52-weeks, this had reduced to a median curvature to 28° (range: 14° - 44°) (p=0.03). This represented a median reduction in penile curvature by 24.3% (range: 16.9% - 53.3%) and a mean change of -11.6°±3.58° in curvature for each patient. Overall, the IIEF Overall scores were comparable at baseline and at 52 week follow-up (median: 59, range: 33 - 71 vs. median: 60, range: 52 – 72 respectively, p=0.81). However, patients did report significant improvement in overall PDQ scores at baseline as compared to 52- weeks after laser treatment (median: 26, range: 15 - 30, vs. median: 14, range: 6 – 23 respectively, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Fractional CO2 laser therapy may serve as a safe and minimally invasive therapy for PD, with results at both 24 and 52 weeks being encouraging. Further clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fractional CO2 laser therapy in the treatment of PD.

Due to differences in the physical and chemical properties of CO2 and N2, along with a reduction in the momentum ratio between oxidant and fuel streams, the local extinction of oxy-fuel flames is significantly more pronounced compared to conventional air–fuel flames, which poses challenges in the design and operation of oxy-fuel burners. This study further validates the species-weighted flamelet/progress variable (FPV) model proposed in previous work [Jiang et al., 2023], particularly in oxy-fuel flames characterized by highly local extinction. Large eddy simulations were conducted on the Sandia oxy-fuel jet diffusion flame at various Reynolds numbers. The predictions are systematically compared with experimental data, and the influence of Reynolds number on local extinction is thoroughly analyzed. The results demonstrate that the numerical simulation effectively predicts mean temperature, species mass fractions, differential diffusion parameters (ZHC), and local extinction in oxy-fuel jet flames across a wide range of Reynolds numbers. The errors in predicted mean temperature and mass fractions exhibit a slight increase with rising Reynolds numbers, yet remain below 15 %. As the Reynolds number increases from 12,000 to 18,000, the predicted peak ZHC decreases by 30 %, and the beneficial effect of preferential diffusion of H2 weakens, while the adverse effect of CO2 on combustion becomes stronger.

La, Mn and Co-based materials with diverse compositions encapsulated in N-doped carbon materials were synthesized by an in-situ sol-gel method. The as-prepared materials were physically activated with CO2 giving as a result composites with excellent performance for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The composites were characterized by different physicochemical techniques revealing the importance of porosity created by CO2 activation. This crucial step increases the number of accessible active sites such as Co-Nx-C sites, Co/MnO heterointerfaces and graphitic N groups. Moreover, the formation of La2O2CO3 was detected to enhance electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance and it is active for ORR. Although the composite containing La, Mn and Co has less concentration of the highly active sites, its small particle size favour a better distribution of these sites. The Co-containing composites were tested as air-electrodes in a Zn-air battery and compared to commercial electrocatalysts. All composites showed a better operation in terms of higher cyclability and higher energy density which is a consequence of metal nanostructures encapsulation in N-doped porous carbon shells. Interestingly, the pure Co-based composite showed an outstanding performance related to the high concentration of the Co-Nx-C active sites that provide high activity and stability.

Introduction Use of home non invasive ventilation (NIV) to treat persistent hypercapnic respiratory failure in patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) effectively reduces readmission rates and mortality compared with standard therapy. Traditional workflows around the initiation and management of NIV include elective admission for therapy initiation and frequent face to face clinic visits for follow up, but use of telemedicine offers an alternative approach. Aim This retrospective cohort study evaluated the clinical efficacy and health resource use impact of a remote monitoring approach to the initiation and monitoring of home NIV. Methods Individuals with COPD, COPD obstructive sleep apnoea or obesity related respiratory failure who were started on remote-monitored home NIV from July 2016 to December 2020 were included. Data were obtained from electronic health records. The primary outcome was healthcare utilisation (hospital admissions and average number of bed days) in the 12 months after versus 12 months before starting NIV; secondary endpoints included 2 year survival and time to readmission, and blood gas analysis. Results In the 12 months after versus before NIV initiation, there was a significant reduction in the mean number of admissions (1.0± 2.1 vs. 1.4± 2.1; p<0.0001) and occupied bed days (9.6± 26.8 vs. 17.2± 27.5; p<0.0001); results were consistent across NIV indications. Time to first readmission (hazard ratio [HR] 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.58 – 2.8; p<0.001) and time to death (HR 2.25, 95% CI 1.51 – 3.34; p<0.0001) were significantly worse in NIV non users versus users, but did not differ by deprivation quintile. Blood gas analysis showed that NIV significantly reduced carbon dioxide pressure and bicarbonate compared with before NIV. Conclusions A technology assisted service model for the remote initiation and monitoring of home NIV therapy for individuals with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure was feasible, had a beneficial effect on healthcare utilisation and outcomes, and offset typical adverse relative survival outcomes associated with deprivation.

Blast furnace ironmaking produces abundant CO2, and molten oxide electrolysis (MOE) attracts great interest in ironmaking due to its carbon-free emissions. However, the anodes are the key limiting factor, making them very challenging due to high temperature and the intensive oxidation atmosphere. In this respect, a non-consumable argon plasma anode for iron electrolysis is proposed as a new technological process. During electrolysis, argon ionizes anodically and forms Ar+, which will jet into the molten oxide electrolyte and react with the O2– complex anion from the electrolyte. Metallic iron is obtained by cathodic reduction, while oxygen evolution and argon regeneration occur in the electrolyte through 2O2–(complex) + 4Ar+ = O2 + 4Ar, demonstrating the workability of the argon plasma as a non-consumable anode for molten oxide electrolysis.

The global demand for sustainable energy solutions in the oil and gas industry has stimulated interest in the integration of renewable energy sources. This paper investigates the techno-economic and environmental aspects of incorporating a solar-hydrogen-based hybrid renewable energy system (SHRES) into oil and gas processing facilities. The proposed SHRES, comprising Solar PV modules, hydrogen production and storage systems, and a gas turbine generator (PV-FC-EL-Tank-GT), aims to enhance energy efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of energy-intensive operations. The study utilises a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing engineering, economics, and environmental analysis. The techno-economic evaluation employs detailed modelling and optimisation using Fick's Law Algorithm, ensuring efficient energy production and cost-effectiveness. Ecological assessments quantify potential reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts. The technical and economic evaluation identifies the electrolyser system as the most significant cost contributor (57%). The optimised system balances energy sources with 45% from PV modules, 35% from fuel cells, and 20% from gas turbines, showcasing substantial reliance on renewable energy while maintaining required power generation. Addressing the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions in the oil and gas industry, the study highlights the potential of SHRES integration. By employing Fick's Law Algorithm, alongside with 80 % of renewable energy integration, the research optimises system components to optimise the annualised cost to be $57,539.85, decrease to zero the Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP), and mitigate CO2 emissions to a lowest value of 0.147 gCO2eq/kWh (by 80 %). The electrolyser system's pivotal role and the distribution of power generation sources are emphasised. This study presents a novel approach to integrating solar-hydrogen systems into oil and gas processing facilities, aiming for sustainability. The findings underscore the significance of the electrolyser system and the distribution of power generation sources in optimising the SHRES. Recommendations for renewable energy integration and potential reductions in CO2 emissions and costs are discussed, providing valuable insights for future energy policies.

The use of tailings sand for CO2 mineralization and utilization (CMU) has been emerging globally, offering a sustainable solution for repurposing tailings sand while establishing a stable carbon sink. Despite several reports that evaluated process performance and project benefits, existing research has not delved into the project layout focusing on the tailings pond facility and the feasibility considerations from a cluster and ownership perspective. Conducting facility-scale refined mineralized carbon sink (MCS) and layout feasibility assessment is a key issue that needs to be addressed urgently. Here, we accounted for CMU potential (CMUP) of tailings sand using a sample of 6219 tailings pond ownerships in China, predicted future annual carbon sinks through an innovative ARIMA-cloud model, and analyzed the feasibility of project layouts within potential clusters concerning enterprise size. Our results indicate that the CMUP of accumulated tailings sand in China amounts to 1817.87 Mt. In a combined scenario involving future technological leapfrogging and increased utilization, the average annual carbon sink by 2030 is projected to be 24.73 Mt. A considerable reduction in project layout feasibility across all scenarios was observed due to the mismatch between carbon clusters and enterprise size. Our study reveals that CMU using tailings sand should be regarded as one of the essential green technologies in the portfolio of strategic Chinese CO2 mitigation. However, we highlight the necessity of aligning cluster programs with the support capacity of the ownership enterprise to ensure the optimal project success.

Lack of safe water availability and access to clean water cause a higher risk of infectious diseases and other diseases as well. Heavy metals (HMs) are inorganic pollutants that cause severe threats to humans, animals, and the environment. Therefore, an effective HM removal technology is urgently needed. In the present study, a customized bipolar membrane electrodialysis process was used to remove HMs from aqueous solutions. The impacts of the feed ionic strength, applied electrical potential, and the type and concentration of HMs (Cd2+, Co2+, Cr3+, Cu2+, and Ni2+) on the process performance were investigated. The results showed that feed solution pH changes occurred in four stages: it first decreased linearly before stabilizing in the acidic pH range, followed by an increase and stabilization in the basic range of the pH scale. HM speciation in the basic pH range revealed the presence of anionic HM species. The presence of HMs on anion exchange membranes confirmed the contribution of these membranes for HM removal in the base channels of the process. While no clear trend was seen in the ionic strength solution, the maximum HM removal was observed when 1.5 g/L NaCl was used. The initial HM concentration showed a linear increase in HMs removal of up to 30 mg/L. A similar trend was seen with an increase in the applied electrical potential of up to 15 V. In general, the amount of HMs removed increased in the following order: Cd2+ ˃ Ni2+ ˃ Co2+ ˃ Cu2+ ˃ Cr3+. Under some operational conditions, however, the removed amount of Cu2+, Co2+, and Ni2+ was similar. The mass balance and SEM-EDX results revealed that the removed HMs were sorbed onto the membranes. In conclusion, this process efficiently separates HMs from aqueous solutions. It showed the features of diluate pH adjustment, reduction in the overall stack electrical resistance, and contribution of anion exchange membranes in multivalent cation removal. The mechanisms involved in HMs removal were diffusion and migration from the bulk solution, followed by their sorption on both cation and anion exchange membranes.

Climate warming and air pollution are the main environmental problems in China. This study used China's Carbon Accounting Database, energy economic model, and air quality model to analyze the potential carbon emission peaking path and synergistic air quality improvement gain in the industrial sector in Hunan Province. Based on China's Carbon Accounting Database and the local industry/energy statistical yearbooks in Hunan, the total CO2 emissions in Hunan Province in 2019 were 310.6 Mt, of which the industrial sector accounted for over 70% of the emissions, mainly from the production and supply of electricity, steam, and heat; the production of non-metallic minerals; and the smelting and pressing of ferrous metals. Three potential industrial carbon emission peaking scenarios were analyzed using the LEAP energy economic model, including the business-as-usual scenario (peaking by 2030), moderate emission reduction scenario (peaking by 2028), and aggressive emission reduction scenario (peaking by 2025), by employing different economic growth rates, energy technology progress, and energy structures of the industrial sector. Furthermore, by combining the anthropogenic air pollutant emission inventory and the regional air quality model WRF-Chem, we analyzed the air quality improvement associated with various carbon emission peak paths. The results showed that the annual mean concentrations of major air pollutants had decreased in the three scenarios, especially in the Chang-Zhu-Tan Region. The aggressive emission reduction scenario was the most effective scenario, followed by the moderate emission reduction scenario and the business-as-usual scenario. Manufacturing was the sector with the most significant synergistic effect of pollution and carbon reduction. When carbon emission peaks were achieved, the annual average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 in Hunan Province could be synergistically reduced by 0.6-1.8 μg·m-3 and 1.8-8.9 μg·m-3, respectively. Our findings offer important insights into carbon emission peaking and can provide useful information for potential mitigation actions.

The door of a passenger car is one of the key components used for the safety of passengers from side collisions. Mostly car doors are made of Steel that increase the overall weight of the vehicle since steel is the primary metal used for the construction of door. The main objective of this research is to replace Steel material of a car door with low-cost automotive materials such as aluminium alloy, magnesium alloy, and carbon fibre material to perform weight reduction analysis without compromising the strength and safety. A comprehensive theoretical study of the existing car door has been performed with 3D Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models through commercially available software SolidWorks. Results of this research work revealed that by selecting the appropriate engineering materials of the doors for a commercially available passenger car, the overall weight reduced to 45% when used aluminium material and 64% when used magnesium and carbon-fibre materials compared to the total weight of four doors made of typical steel material. Furthermore, reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emission was also obtained by reducing the overall weight of the passenger car doors. Lastly, the performance was measured through power-to-weight ratio (PWR) analysis for steel and aluminium which revealed that the latter material was more economical and lighter in weight than the former material.

In case of cement industry, large amounts of waste by-products are effectively utilized as alternative sources for fuel and raw materials. The objective of this study is to assess environmental effects on cement manufacturing process in utilization of wastes compared to the alternative waste treatment systems, such as landfill and/or incineration, etc. Both LCI and LCIA were conducted with a perspective of gate to grave as well as scenario analysis in order to figure out more detailed environmentally key issuses. The seven major manufacturing companies were chosen for portland cement - Type I and conducted LCI. Generally, site-specific data was applied. If it's not impossible, database was used. Impact assessment was carried out consecutively as classification, characterization, normalization and weighting by Eco-indicator. The eco-indicators of cement system, scenario A(bituminous coal), B(raw material), C(landfill/incineration/recycling) were 53.4288, 2.0307, 0.00077, respectively. The key issues of cement system is a GWP by CO2 released kiln. The scenario analysis is performed in order to compare the reduction of environmental impact when recycled resources make used of kiln and treatment system. The environmental burden of kiln system is lower than landfill and/or incineration system.

Demographic studies suggest that mortality of emerging bunchgrass seedlings limits restoration success across North American cold desert rangelands, but how variation in seedling resilience to ecophysiological stress contributes to this is unclear. We measured light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Asat), apparent CO2 assimilation quantum yield (ΦCO2), and light-adapted PSII yield (ΦPSII) of seedlings from two native perennial bunchgrasses (Elymus elymoides, Pseudoroegneria spicata) during and in recovery from acute water stress (6% soil moisture). All seedlings of both species survived the 14-d dry-down and recovery, and both had ∼95% reduction in Asat and ΦCO2 by day 3 of the dry-down but had divergent recoveries from the acute water stress. E. elymoides took a single day to recover Asat and ΦCO2 to prestress levels, while it took P. spicata 6 d to have 50% recovery from acute water stress. Especially notable is that after reduction in ΦPSII on d 7 of the dry-down, E. elymoides recovered within 1 d at a lower ΦPSII compared with pretreatment, while P. spicata had an additional 1-d lag in ΦPSII recovery. These results suggest that E. elymoides (Turkey Lake germplasm) seedlings are more physiologically resilient to acute water stress than P. spicata (Anatone germplasm), which has implications for restoration planning and native plant breeding.

Cu catalysts, known for their unparalleled catalytic capabilities due to their unique electronic structure, have faced inherent challenges in maintaining long-term effectiveness under harsh hydrogenation conditions. Here, we demonstrate a molybdenum-mediated redispersion behavior of Cu under high-temperature oxidation conditions. The oxidized Cu nanoparticles with rich metal-support interfaces tend to dissolve into the MoO3 support upon heating to 600 °C, which facilitates the subsequent regeneration in a reducing atmosphere. A similar redispersion phenomenon is observed for Cu nanoparticles supported on ZnO-modified MoO3. The modification of ZnO significantly improves the performance of the Cu catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, with the high activity being well maintained after four repeated oxidation-reduction cycles. In situ spectroscopic and theoretical analyses suggest that the interaction involved in the formation of the copper molybdate-like compound is the driving force for the redispersion of Cu. This method is applicable to various Mo-based oxide supports, offering a practical strategy for the regeneration of sintered Cu particles in hydrogenation applications.

Wood pellets have become a preferred solid biomass fuel for heat and power generation due to their standardized nature, known properties, and consistent quality. However, pellets produced from fresh sawdust sometimes undergo self-heating and off-gassing and this poses a challenge for their transportation and storage. The aim of this thesis was to increase the body of knowledge towards understanding the mechanisms underlying the self-heating and off-gassing of wood pellets. The results from paper I showed that the total amount of extractives in the raw material has little effect on off-gassing. Although pellets produced from Scots pine sawdust with lower extractive contents exhibited reduced concentrations of off-gasses; CO, CO2 and CH4, increasing the extractive content of the sawdust through the addition of additive oils did not result in increased off-gas emissions. The results of pure cellulose pellets with added additive oils showed that off-gassing is influenced by the type of extractives in the raw material (paper II). The highest concentrations of off-gasses were recorded from pure cellulose pellets with added linseed oil due to their high content of unsaturated fatty acids of 73.9% linolenic and 7.6% linoleic. The results from papers III and IV indicated significant effects of both raw material and drying temperature on off-gassing and self-heating of wood pellets. There was a strong linear correlation between off-gassing and the sapwood content of the raw material, with correlation coefficient (R) values greater than 0.9 at p < 0.001 for all the off-gases (paper III). An increase in sapwood content led to a significant increase in off-gassing of CO2, CO and CH4, and O2 consumption. Storing of sawdust for over six months prior to pellet production, and increasing the drying temperature led to a significant reduction in off-gassing for sapwood pellets. For heartwood pellets, increasing the drying temperature resulted in increased off-gassing while raw material storage had no effect. In the other study (paper IV), the pellets produced from Scots pine mature wood sawdust were more prone to self-heating and off-gassing compared to those produced from juvenile wood sawdust. Steam drying the sawdust at high temperature led to a significant reduction in heat and gas generation for both materials. The overall results indicated that a biological process, in combination with the chemical oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids lay behind the self-heating and off-gassing of wood pellets.

In the quest for proficient electrocatalysts for ammonia's electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction, cobalt oxides, endowed with a rich d-electron reservoir, have emerged as frontrunners. Despite the previously evidenced prowess of CoO in this realm, its ammonia yield witnesses a pronounced decline as the reaction unfolds, a phenomenon linked to the electron attrition from its Co2+ active sites during electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR). To counteract this vulnerability, we harnessed electron-laden phosphorus (P) elements as dopants, aiming to recalibrate the electronic equilibrium of the pivotal Co active site, thereby bolstering both its catalytic performance and stability. Our empirical endeavors showcased the doped P-CoO's superior credentials: it delivered an impressive ammonia yield of 49.6 and, notably, a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 9.6% at −0.2 V versus RHE, markedly eclipsing its undoped counterpart. Probing deeper, a suite of ex-situ techniques, complemented by rigorous theoretical evaluations, was deployed. This dual-pronged analysis unequivocally revealed CoO's propensity for an electron-driven valence metamorphosis to Co3+ post-ENRR. In stark contrast, P-CoO, fortified by P doping, exhibits a discernibly augmented ammonia yield. Crucially, P's intrinsic ability to staunch electron leakage from the active locus during ENRR ensures the preservation of the valence state, culminating in enhanced catalytic dynamism and fortitude. This investigation not only illuminates the intricacies of active site electronic modulation in ENRR but also charts a navigational beacon for further enhancements in this domain.

Alternative energy storage systems to lithium-ion batteries that can reduce the dependency on such technology have attracted great interest in recent years. Besides their current limitations, multivalent batteries based on coupling a metallic anode (Mg, Zn, Ca…) with a multivalent intercalation cathode are considered as a potential option. Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) have shown promising multivalent intercalation capacities and have also been employed in other scientific fields like wastewater treatment, selective element extraction, and may have a potential applicability in batteries recycling. However, some controversies have recently appeared around the capacity of PBAs to incorporate multivalent cations in aqueous media. In this work, we analyze by a combinatorial approach using structural and electrochemical techniques the potential Ni2+ and Co2+ intercalation in K0.61Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.84□0.16·2.12H2O, its limitations, the role of proton intercalation and the cation released after oxidation, which differed from the intercalated during previous reduction step. The potential implications of such findings in current uses of PBAs for multivalent batteries are also discussed.

Electrocatalytic urea synthesis under ambient conditions offers a promising alternative strategy to the traditional energy-intensive urea industry protocol. Limited by the electrostatic interaction, the reduction reaction of anions at the cathode in the electrocatalytic system is not easily achievable. Here, we propose a novel strategy to overcome electrostatic interaction via pulsed electroreduction. We found that the reconstruction-resistant CuSiOx nanotube, with abundant atomic Cu-O-Si interfacial sites, exhibits ultrastability in the electrosynthesis of urea from nitrate and CO2. Under a pulsed potential approach with optimal operating conditions, the Cu-O-Si interfaces achieve a superior urea production rate (1606.1 μg h-1 mgcat.-1) with high selectivity (79.01%) and stability (the Faradaic efficiency is retained at 80% even after 80 h of testing), outperforming most reported electrocatalytic synthesis urea catalysts. We believe our strategy will incite further investigation into pulsed electroreduction increasing substrate transport, which may guide the design of ambient urea electrosynthesis and other energy conversion systems.

Postoperative evaluations of patients, who undergo of transoral thyroarytenoid myoneurectomy using CO2 laser for the treatment of Adductor Spasmodic Dysphonia (ASD), reveal some residual laryngeal symptoms such as intermittent spasms, vocal effort, and stiffness in laryngeal muscles which can be identified on videolaryngo-stroboscopy (VLS) by patterns of Muscle Tension Dysphonia (MTD) and mucosal wave, and as deviations in acoustic perceptual measures. This study aims to document these vocal symptoms observed postoperatively, and most importantly highlight the need for voice therapy postoperatively and report the short-term vocal outcomes post-therapy.Retrospective case series.The case series includes five patients, three females and two males, in the age range of 40 to 76years, who underwent transoral thyroarytenoid myoneurectomy using CO2 laser for severe ASD. The assessment protocol to document pretherapy (3-week postop) and post-therapy (after 1month of therapy) findings included VLS, Maximum Phonation Time (MPT), VHI-10 GRBAS, and Multi-Dimensional Voice Profile (MDVP) (acoustic voice analysis). Voice therapy regimen included Resonant Voice Therapy, semi-occluded vocal tract exercises, Vocal Function Exercises, and/or breath support exercises customized for individual symptoms.MTD of varying grades, MPT less than 10 seconds, deviant F0, mild to moderate degrees of perceptually rough and predominantly strained voice were noted in the pretherapy evaluation. Following 1month of voice therapy, changes noted were a reduction in strained and rough voice quality and an increase in MPT and muscle tension. Improvement of almost all parameters of MDVP tended towards normative as compared to pretherapy including F0.Voice therapy initiated at the earliest recovery stage postoperatively does lead to positive short-term vocal outcomes in patients with severe ASD. It is necessary to have long-term follow-ups and aim for the maintenance of satisfactory vocal outcomes.

In this work, a new triazine-based covalent organic framework (COF) was synthesized and further modified by 9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene-10-oxide (DOPO) to obtain a 'honeycomb-like' DOPO@COF material, which was used as flame retardant (FR) for epoxy resin (EP). Surprisingly, DOPO@COF overcomes the ineffective effect of DOPO on smoke release inhibition and the weak flame retardancy of COF. DOPO@COF can exhibit suppression of smoke and harmful gases while effectively reducing heat release. When incorporating 3 wt% of DOPO@COF into the EP (0.2 wt% phosphorus content), significant reductions of 39.0% in peak heat release rate (pHRR), 18.7% in total heat release rate (THR), 20.6% in peak CO production rate (pCOPR), and 38.7% in peak CO2 production rate (pCO2PR) were observed. Moreover, the introduction of DOPO@COF effectively enhances the storage modulus, crosslinking density and the tensile and impact strength of EP composite. This work provides a new research idea for the development of N, P synergistic EP FRs for nanomaterials based on DOPO and triazine-based COFs.

Agriculture and its supply chain pose significant environmental threats. This study employs Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to explore the environmental impact of fresh bell pepper production and distribution, comparing Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture (UPA) with Rural Long-Distance Food Supply Systems (RLDFS). Four UPA scenarios (hydroponics, soil-based greenhouse, open-field conventional, and organic) and two RLDFS scenarios (soil-based greenhouse and open-field conventional) are evaluated using SimaPro, incorporating input from UPA practitioners and rural farmers. Results reveal an energy demand range of 0.011 to 5.5 kWh/kg eq., with urban greenhouses exhibiting the lowest consumption and hydroponics the highest due to lighting, ventilation, and irrigation. Hydroponics exhibits a global warming potential of 7.24 kg of CO2 eq·kg−1, with energy demand contributing over 95 %, surpassing other scenarios by 7–25 times, necessitating reduction for sustainability. RLDFS's environmental impact is dominated by transportation (over 70 %), meanwhile other UPA systems are influenced by irrigation, infrastructure, and fertilizers. Despite challenges, UPA-hydroponics proves to be 1.7 to 4.3 times more land-use-efficient than other scenarios, emphasizing its potential. The study highlights the need to address electricity usage in UPA-hydroponics for carbon footprint reduction. Despite challenges, hydroponics could contribute to sustainable food security, and RLDFS does not significantly lag in environmental performance compared to UPA other than Ozone layer depletion criteria attributed to fossil fuel usage in transportation. These insights offer valuable guidance for urban development and policy formulation, promoting sustainable agricultural practices and supporting policies for agronomic and supply chain sustainability.

To quantify the carbon source/sink function of riparian zone swamps and explore the feedback relationship with climate change, we measured the annual fluxes of soil greenhouse gas, soil carbon emission, net vegetation carbon sequestration and related environmental factors (temperature, water level, etc.) by static chamber-gas chromatography and relative growth equation methods in three kinds of forest swamps (Alnus sibirica swamp, Betula platyphylla swamp, and Larix olgensis swamp) distributed along the water reduction gradient of lowland to highland in the stream riparian zone of Changbai Mountains. The results showed that the annual fluxes of CH4(0.19-0.85 mg·m-2·h-1), CO2(60.81-228.63 mg·m-2·h-1), and N2O (-0.02-0.05 mg·m-2·h-1) showed spatial variations along the water gradient of lowland to highland, with a trend of first constant then decreasing, decreasing, and first absorption then emission, respectively. The spatial variations of annual fluxes of these greenhouse gases were controlled by water levels. The annual net carbon sequestration of vegetation (2.61-3.45 t C·hm-2·a-1) was constant along the water gradient, which was mainly promoted by nitrate nitrogen content. The carbon source/sink and global warming potential (GWP) undergo regular changes along water gradients. The A. sibirica swamp was a carbon sink (1.93 t C·hm-2·a-1), the B. platyphylla swamp was a weak carbon source (-0.18 t C·hm-2·a-1), and the L. olgensis swamp was a strong carbon source (-2.51 t C·hm-2·a-1). The spatial variation of carbon source/sink in forest swamps was jointly promoted by water level and nitrate nitrogen content. A. sibirica swamp exhibited a strong cooling effect with a strong negative feedback effect on climate change (-5.88 t CO2·hm-2·a-1). L. olgensis swamp exhibited a strong warming effect with a strong positive feedback effect (10.97 t CO2·hm-2·a-1). B. platyphylla swamp exhibited a weak warming effect, approximately neutral (2.95 t CO2·hm-2·a-1). The spatial variation of GWP in forest swamps was mainly inhibited by water level.为量化河岸带湿地碳源/汇并探究其对气候变化的反馈关系,采用静态箱-气相色谱法和相对生长方程法,测定长白山溪流河岸带低地至高地沿水分减小梯度依次分布的3种森林沼泽(毛赤杨沼泽、白桦沼泽和落叶松沼泽)土壤温室气体年通量、土壤年净碳排放量、植被年净固碳量及相关环境因子(温度、水位等)。结果表明: 长白山溪流河岸带森林沼泽的CH4(0.19～0.85 mg·m-2·h-1)、CO2(60.81～228.63 mg·m-2·h-1)和N2O(-0.02～0.05 mg·m-2·h-1)年通量沿低地至高地水分梯度依次呈先恒定后降低、递减和先吸收后排放的空间变化规律,且这3种温室气体年通量的空间变化均受水位控制。河岸带森林沼泽的植被年净固碳量(2.61～3.45 t C·hm-2·a-1)沿水分梯度呈恒定型,主要受硝态氮含量促进。河岸带森林沼泽的碳源/汇及全球增温潜势(GWP)沿水分梯度发生了规律性的转变,其中,毛赤杨沼泽为碳汇(1.93 t C·hm-2·a-1),白桦沼泽为弱碳源(-0.18 t C·hm-2·a-1),而落叶松沼泽为强碳源(-2.51 t C·hm-2·a-1);且森林沼泽碳源/汇的空间变化受水位和硝态氮含量联合促进。毛赤杨沼泽表现为强冷却效应,与气候变化间存在较强负反馈作用(-5.88 t CO2·hm-2·a-1);落叶松沼泽表现为强增温效应,存在较强正反馈作用(10.97 t CO2·hm-2·a-1);而白桦沼泽表现为弱增温效应,近似于中性(2.95 t CO2·hm-2·a-1);且森林沼泽GWP的空间变化主要受水位抑制。.

Electrochemical hydrogen compression is a promising alternative to conventional mechanical compression due to low maintenance costs and high one-stage compression ratios. The typically employed planar systems, however, are intrinsically difficult to operate in high differential pressure environments. Tubular systems are inherently advantageous for high differential pressure systems but require innovative membrane electrode assembly development. This study unveils the first tubular EHC featuring a membrane electrode assembly supported by a stainless steel 3D-printed porous anode. The membrane electrode assembly for gas-phase electrochemistry is produced by spray coating the porous anode with Pt/C as the catalyst and joining the anode with a tubular catalyst-coated membrane. Electrochemical characterization demonstrates the functionality of the tubular EHC at current densities up to 60 mAcm−2 with a cell potential of 200 mV under non-pressurized conditions. Moreover, a pressure difference of 2 bar is achieved at 60 mAcm−2 within the first 60 min in continuous mode. By demonstrating the proof-of-principle for the first tubular EHC, this work paves the way for new research avenues in electrochemical process engineering, offering a broad spectrum of applications, from enhancing EHC technologies to advancing electrochemical CO2 reduction.

Enhancing soil health is critical to improve crop productivity, fertilizer use efficiency, and resilience to climate change impacts for smallholder farmers in Africa. Increasing the use of mineral fertilizers is critical for achieving higher crop yield and residue return. However, it is crucial to consider the simultaneous use of carbon (C)-rich organic materials alongside mineral fertilizers to support soil health and enhance fertilizer use efficiency. It is proposed that increasing mineral fertilizer use without a concurrent increase in C-rich organic materials may not enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil health in the long term. When the labile pool of nutrients is increased through mineral fertilizer, it can reduce microbial C use efficiency, thereby hindering the formation and stabilization of SOC. This reduction in efficiency can cause a more significant proportion of the returned plant residues to be lost as CO2 through microbial respiration rather than being incorporated into the SOC pool. However, this effect can be mitigated by the concurrent application of large amounts of organic amendments, such as compost, manure or biochar, which provide a balanced supply of nutrients and C substrates to support microbial activity and enhance SOC formation.

High transportation costs have been a barrier to the expansion of agriculture in the interior of Brazil. To reduce transportation costs, Brazil launched the National Logistics Plan, aiming to expand its railway network by up to 91 % by 2035. Such a large-scale infrastructure investment raises concerns about its economic and environmental consequences. By combining geospatial estimation of transportation cost with a grid-resolving, multi-scale economic model that bridges fine-scale crop production with its trade and demand from national and global perspectives, we explore impacts of transportation infrastructure expansion on agricultural production, land use changes, and carbon emissions both locally and nationally in Brazil. We find that globally, the impacts on output and land use changes are small. However, within Brazil, the plan's primary impacts are impressive. PNL2035 results in the reduction of transportation costs by 8-23 % across states (depending on expansion's extent) in the interior Cerrado biome. This results in cropland expansion and increases in terrestrial carbon emissions in the Cerrado region. However, the increase in terrestrial carbon emissions in the Cerrado is offset by spillover effects elsewhere in Brazil, as crop production shifts away from the Southeast-South regions and accompanying change in the mix of transportation mode for farm products from roadway to more emission-efficient railway. Furthermore, we argue that the transportation infrastructure's impact on the enhanced mobility of labor and other agricultural inputs would further accentuate the regional shift in agricultural production and contribute to carbon emission mitigation. Upon its completion, PNL2035 is expected to result in the reduction of net national emissions by 1.8-30.7 million metric ton of CO2-equivalent, depending on the impacts on labor and purchased input mobility. We conclude that the omission of spillover effects due to infrastructure expansion can lead to misleading assessments of transport policies.

In the pharmaceutical industry, energy efficiency has played a minor role compared to other energy-intensive industries. However, there is a growing recognition of the need to address environmental concerns. With ambitious climate targets and the increasing demand for significant reductions in CO2 emissions, the pharmaceutical industry is now embracing the opportunity to enhance its sustainability practices. Mainly fossil fuels are used to provide process steam at moderate temperature levels at about 160-180°C and to a lesser extent to provide hot water or for on-site power production in CHPs. In this paper, the main processes with demands for process heat, such as media supply, cleaning, or air conditioning, are presented and possibilities for increasing efficiency, for switching to alternative heat supply and for using alternative process technologies are evaluated with respect to economics, but also regarding hurdles for implementation such as requirements for revalidation of production processes and possible necessity of re-approval of products. The present study highlights the potentials for decarbonization of the Austrian pharmaceutical industry using a generic but representative production site applying various measures that either reduce heating and cooling requirements or alter the temperature requirements for heat supply. It is shown that, at least for the example case, full decarbonization is technically feasibly without an increase in energy costs if efficiency measures are progressively used on demand level.

The renovation of existing energy-inefficient residential buildings is an important measure to improve building energy efficiency and achieve CO2 emission reduction strategic tasks. At present, existing energy-inefficient residential buildings suffer from high energy consumption for heating, low efficiency, and poor indoor thermal comfort. It is necessary to implement energy-saving renovation on existing residential buildings and evaluate the renovation effect. This article took existing energy-inefficient residential buildings as the research object and selected a targeted evaluation system. Based on expert research, the hierarchical-grey correlation degree method was used to determine the weight of indices. Actual testing was conducted on the three nodes of the heat exchange station, secondary network, and the building ontology during the heating seasons of 2015–2016 and 2016–2017 (before and after renovation). Based on measured data, a fuzzy membership degree evaluation model was constructed, and the evaluation results were determined using a linear weighted method to form a complete evaluation system. The evaluation system covered 12 evaluation indices, and the evaluation indices with the largest weight in the criterion and index layer were energy consumption (0.308) and economic contribution rate (0.183), respectively. The average linear weighted evaluation scores before and after the renovation of each node were 14.16 and 29.04, respectively.

Aestivation is a form of seasonal dormancy observed in various insect species, usually coinciding with the summer season. Psylliodes chrysocephala (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), the cabbage stem flea beetle, is a key pest of oilseed rape and obligatorily aestivates as adult in late summer. At present, our understanding of the physiological and transcriptional changes linked to aestivation in P. chrysocephala is still limited. In this study, physiological parameters and RNA-seq analyses were performed with laboratory-reared beetles at pre-aestivation, aestivation, and post-aestivation stages. Measurements of CO2 production supported the notion that aestivating beetles dramatically reduce their metabolic rate and, together with assessments of reproductive maturation, allowed precise discrimination between the three adult stages. Aestivating beetles showed a reduction in carbohydrate reserves and an increase in lipid reserves compared to pre-aestivating beetles, indicating that aestivation is associated with drastic changes in energy metabolism. In agreement with these findings, we found that genes involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, digestion, and mitochondrial activity are differentially expressed between the three stages. Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis suggested the regulation of transcription factors associated with aestivation maintenance and the involvement of cytochrome P450s in conferring a summer-resistant phenotype during the aestivation period. In conclusion, this study represents the first exploration of the transcriptomic and physiological aspects of the aestivation response in P. chrysocephala.

Europe must avoid losing manufacturing SMEs. However, presenting distinct maturity levels, these companies have a hard time fulfilling the necessary ecological sustainability level. Controversially, despite the intense debate about digital technologies, there is still a need for knowledge in the industrial world about the impact of these technologies to make manufacturing SMEs environmentally friendly. According to data made available by Stone Portuguese Federation, in 2019, the Portuguese Ornamental Stone sector (OS.Pt): (i) exported to 116 countries; (ii) ranked 9th in the World International Stone Trade; (iii); was the second country in the world in international trade per capita; (iv) exports covered imports by 660%; (v) 45% of exports were to countries outside Europe and (vi) had a total turnover of EUR1,230 million. Mainly comprised of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the OS.Pt sector is relevant for the Portuguese Economy, representing over 16,600 direct jobs, and is one of the main generators of private employment in inland regions has registered an average annual growth rate in turnover of 5.13% over the last ten years and has generated around 500 new jobs from 2016. By using the Portuguese stone sector case study, considering the investment to improve the operations towards digital, a framework was designed and used in five groups of forty stone manufacturing SMEs, each representing a digital level. Through a quantitative methodology based on five years after the investment, depending on the technology used and level of investment in digital technologies, it was found a potential reduction of CO2 emissions between 10.7% and 35.1%.

In response to the global call for action to reduce CO2 emissions, operational measures such as speed, route optimization, and hull cleaning play a significant role in the maritime industry. These measures can be implemented immediately without significant investment in both newbuilding ships and existing ships. To make accurate decisions regarding operational measures, reliable and precise models of environmental conditions and effects of hull fouling are required. In this study, a data-driven approach using linear regression was applied to predict shaft power, fuel consumption, and speed after intensive data preparation and feature engineering. First, a shaft power prediction model was developed by combining three independent submodels: the RPM-power model, hull fouling model, and environmental effect model. Subsequently, fuel consumption and speed prediction models were developed based on the shaft power prediction model. Model validation was performed on a 174K LNG carrier, and the results showed good accuracy even in long-term ship operations of more than two years. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of the prediction models were 1.60%, 1.70%, and 2.68% for the shaft power, fuel consumption, and speed, respectively. The validated models were applied to two LNG carriers, and satisfactory results were obtained. This study contributes to greenhouse gas (GHS) reduction by providing interpretable, flexible, and accurate models that can help make correct decisions regarding optimal operational measures.

As electrocatalysts, molecular catalysts with large aromatic systems (such as terpyridine, porphyrin, or phthalocyanine) have been widely applied in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, these monomeric catalysts tend to aggregate due to strong π–π interactions, resulting in limited accessibility of the active site. In light of these challenges, we present a novel strategy of active site isolation for enhancing the CO2RR. Six Ru(Tpy)2 were integrated into the skeleton of a metallo-organic supramolecule by stepwise self-assembly in order to form a rhombus-fused six-pointed star R1 with active site isolation. The turnover frequency (TOF) of R1 was as high as 10.73 s–1 at −0.6 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (vs RHE), which is the best reported value so far at the same potential to our knowledge. Furthermore, by increasing the connector density on R1's skeleton, a more stable triangle-fused six-pointed star T1 was successfully synthesized. T1 exhibits exceptional stability up to 126 h at −0.4 V vs RHE and excellent TOF values of CO. The strategy of active site isolation and connector density increment significantly enhanced the catalytic activity by increasing the exposure of the active site. This work provides a starting point for the design of molecular catalysts and facilitates the development of a new generation of catalysts with a high catalytic performance.

The reduction in agricultural carbon emissions (ACEs) in Shandong Province is essential to China’s carbon peak and carbon neutrality objectives. In this regard, we constructed an ACE inventory for Shandong Province at a resolution of 1 km × 1 km, integrating the emission factor method with geographic information system (GIS) technology. Building upon this, we explored the dynamic evolution patterns of ACEs using kernel density estimation and conditional probability density estimation. Additionally, long short-term memory networks were trained to predict ACEs under various scenarios. The results showed that: (1) ACEs in Shandong Province exhibited two stages of change, i.e., “rise and decline”. Notably, 64.39% of emissions originated from the planting industry. The distribution of emissions was closely correlated with regional agricultural production modes. Specifically, CO2 emissions were predominantly distributed in crop cultivation areas, while CH4 and N2O emissions were primarily distributed in livestock breeding areas. The uncertainty of the emission inventory ranged from −12.04% to 10.74%, mainly caused by emission factors. (2) The ACE intensity of various cities in Shandong Province is decreasing, indicating a decoupling between ACEs and agricultural economic growth. Furthermore, the emission disparities among different cities are diminishing, although significant spatial non-equilibrium still persists. (3) From 2022 to 2030, the ACEs in Shandong Province will show a continuous downward trend. By 2030, the projected values under the baseline scenario, low-carbon scenario I, and low-carbon scenario II will be 6301.74 × 104 tons, 5980.67 × 104 tons, and 5850.56 × 104 tons. The low-carbon scenario reveals greater potential for ACE reduction while achieving efficient rural economic development and urbanization simultaneously. This study not only advances the methodology of the ACE inventory but also provides quantitative references and scientific bases for promoting low-carbon, efficient, and sustainable regional agriculture.

The mesoporous metal oxide semiconductors exhibit unique chemical and physical characteristics, making them highly desirable for catalysis, electrochemistry, energy conversion, and energy storage applications. Here, we report the facial fabrication of mesoporous gray SnO2 (MGS) electrocatalysts employing an evaporation-induced co-assembly (EICA) approach, utilizing poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) triblock copolymers Pluronic P123 (PEO-PPO-PEO) triblock copolymer as a template for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). By sustaining the co-assembly conditions and utilizing a thermal treatment technique based on carbon, gray mesoporous SnO2 materials with a high density of active sites and oxygen vacancies can be constructed. The MGS materials were employed in eCO2RR in a flow cell type, which exhibits excellent catalytic activity and selectivity toward formate with a high partial current density of -234 mA cm-2 and Faradic efficiency (FE) of 93.60 % at -1.3 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Interestingly, the mesoporous SnO2 with a 1.5 wt% ratio of Sn precursor to P123 surfactant (MS-1.5@350N-400A) electrode exhibits a high level of Faradaic efficiency (FE) of (98%) at a low overpotential of -0.6 VRHE, which is a seldom recorded performance for similar systems. A stable FE of 96 ± 1% was observed in the range of -0.6 to -1.2 VRHE, which is the result of a large surface area (184 m2 /g) and a high number of active sites and oxygen vacancies within the mesostructured framework.

Advancements in new technologies, a reduction in CO2 emissions, and the rising demand for energy are causing a growth in the share of renewable energy sources. In distribution networks, an increasing number of distributed generators (DGs) makes the utility grid’s protection complex and demanding. Vector surge and rate-of-change-of-frequency are the established anti-islanding protection methods, recognizing that the standard paradigm for protection, involving distributed generation, cannot be set only once but has to be continuously updated following the requirements and changes in the system. One of the requirements is active participation in the preservation of system frequency and voltage, which can be interrupted if the DG trips and disconnects from the utility grid. Anti-islanding protection and spurious tripping can be avoided by implementing new algorithms and techniques. This paper presents a novel protection scheme based on a voltage frequency differential. The proposed algorithm employs remote and local frequency measurements in such a manner that, for the occurrence of a frequency difference, it is assumed that the DG is in an islanding state. In this article, we demonstrate the feasibility of the algorithm through numerical analysis of grid events and laboratory testing emulating real grid-measured values. The test results show that the algorithm is resilient to false tripping for non-islanding events and more reliable than conventional methods in islanding detection. The algorithm can be set to low-frequency differential values, drastically reducing the non-detection zone in any DG type, regardless of its size and voltage level at the point of common coupling. Unlike standard anti-islanding methods, the algorithm supports the ability of the DG to fault-ride through demand.

Microplastics (MPs) pollution and their impact on plants have become a global threat, but their effect at the molecular level remains scarce. This study aims to gain insight into the effects of polyvinylchloride microplastic (PVC-MP) on tomato plants at the genetic and protein levels. In this study, we found that increasing concentrations of PVC-MP (2.5, 5,7.5, and 10% w/w) in the soil did not cause any phytotoxic (chlorosis or necrosis) symptoms but it did result in a dose-dependent reduction in plant growth-related parameters, such as height, leaf area, stem diameter, and plant fresh and dry weight. Additionally, the number of secondary roots was reduced while the primary roots were elongated. Furthermore, PVC-MP also caused a significant decrease in light-harvesting pigments chlorophylls, and carotenoids while increasing the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation in plants. Microscopic analysis of the roots revealed the uptake of PVC-MP of size less than 10 μm. Micro- and macro-element analysis showed changes in concentrations of Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, and Zn, upon PVC-MP exposure. Results from western blotting and q-PCR showed that higher doses of PVC-MP significantly reduced the CO2-fixing enzyme RuBisCO and D1 proteins of PSII at both protein and transcript levels. These findings suggest that lower levels of light-harvesting pigments, D1 protein, RuBisCO, and modulation of nutrient absorption are among the factors responsible for growth suppression in tomato plants upon exposure to PVC-MP. As tomato plants are economically significant crops, an increase in PVC-MP in agricultural fields may have a detrimental influence on crop production, resulting in economic loss.

Abstract This study examines the relationship between inflation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in three major economies: the United States of America (USA), the European Union (EU), and China. The analysis spans from 1960 to 2021 for the USA and EU, and from 1971 to 2021 for China. A feedforward neural network model, optimized using the Levenberg–Marquardt backpropagation algorithm, was employed to predict GHG emissions based on annual inflation rates and fossil fuel energy consumption. The study integrates historical data on inflation trends with GHG emissions, measured in CO2 equivalents, and fossil fuel energy consumption, expressed as a percentage of total energy use. This multidimensional approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the economic-environmental interplay in these regions. Key findings indicate a nonlinear response of GHG emissions to inflation rates. In the USA, GHG emissions begin to decrease when inflation rates exceed 4.7%. Similarly, in the EU, a steep reduction in emissions is observed beyond a 7.5% inflation rate. China presents a more complex pattern, with two critical inflection points: the first at a 4.5% inflation rate, where GHG emissions start to decline sharply, and the second at a 7% inflation rate, beyond which further increases in inflation do not significantly reduce emissions. A critical global insight is the identification of a uniform inflation rate, around 4.4%, across all regions, at which GHG emissions consistently increase by 1%, hinting at a shared global economic behavior impacting the environment. This discovery is vital for policymakers, emphasizing the need for tailored regional strategies that consider unique economic structures, energy policies, and environmental regulations, alongside a coordinated global approach.

MHP-PV/T is a novel PV/T with phase change heat transfer, uniform flow of working medium and good anti-freeze performance. The excellent year-round performance of MHP-PV/T has been demonstrated in previous studies and is more suitable for winter heating in northern China. In this work, we further combine MHP-PV/T with dual source heat pump to form an experimentally validated indirect expansion-solar assisted heat pump (IDX-SAHP) system and simulates the overall performance of the heating system in winter based on TRNSYS in Lanzhou, China. The component type50b of TRNSYS was modified to make it closer to the actual results of MHP-PV/T. Research shown that the thermal efficiency of MHP-PV/T heat pump system can be maintained well throughout the heating season at the SAHP/ASHP switching temperature is 7 ℃ in winter. The net system energy efficiency ratio (NSEER) during heating season is range from 3.28 to 5.42, which can achieve highly efficient and low cost heating. For this system, the photovoltaic power generation is sufficient to meet the operation of three water pumps. By connecting surplus electricity to the grid, a total of 1806.25 ¥ of electricity revenue can be obtained around the year. The PEUR of the system is 72.26 %, the DPP taking 5.133 years, and the annual CO2 emission reduction is 13486.5 kg. Significant energy, economic, and environmental benefits of the system. This study demonstrates the application prospects of PV/T heat pumps and provides a reference basis for subsequent research on MHP-PV/T heat pump systems in cold regions.

The UK Government's Climate Change Act (CCA) aims to achieve a net zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050. Supermarkets, being among the most energy-intensive non-residential buildings, play a pivotal role in this endeavour. This research delves into the influence of climate change on supermarket buildings, exploring methodologies to mitigate its impact and assessing its effects on operational energy and carbon emissions. The United Nations has emphasized the built environment's significant contribution to global CO2 emissions, necessitating urgent action. Using a quantitative approach, this study employs the TAS – EDSL software to simulate energy consumption, carbon emission, and building regulations for various supermarket case studies. The research also evaluates the performance of these buildings across different UK climates and emission scenarios, incorporating EU Zebra2020 tool metrics. The primary challenge encountered was the scarcity of literature specifically targeting the UK supermarket industry in the context of climate change. The research underscores the importance of balancing energy consumption, carbon emissions, and future climate adaptations, especially given the industry's nZEB target by 2050. The findings of this study serve as a beacon for all non-residential buildings, bridging the knowledge gap between climate change, building futureproofing, and emission reduction strategies. The research underscores the importance of long-term planning, continuous monitoring of energy-intensive buildings, and the holistic approach of reducing emissions across a building's lifespan. This research aims to guide policymakers and building designers in future-proofing structures, emphasizing the need for energy-efficient measures and the integration of renewable technologies. The overarching goal is to foster the creation of sustainable, climate-resilient buildings for future generations.

Abstract Plate tectonics plays an essential role in the redistribution of life-essential volatile elements between Earth's interior and surface, whereby our planet has been well tuned to maintain enduring habitability over much of its history. Here we present an overview of deep carbon recycling in the regime of modern plate tectonics, with a special focus on convergent plate margins for assessing global carbon mass balance. The up-to-date flux compilation implies approximate balance between deep carbon outflux and subduction carbon influx within uncertainty but remarkably limited return of carbon to convecting mantle. If correct, carbon would gradually accumulate in the lithosphere over time by (i) massive subsurface carbon storage occurring primarily in continental lithosphere from convergent margins to continental interior and (ii) persistent surface carbon sinks to seafloors sustained by high-flux deep CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Further assessment of global carbon mass balance requires updates on fluxes of subduction-driven carbon recycling paths and reduction in uncertainty of deep carbon outflux. From a global plate tectonics point of view, we particularly emphasize that continental reworking is an important mechanism for remobilizing geologically sequestered carbon in continental crust and sub-continental lithospheric mantle. In light of recent advances, future research is suggested to focus on a better understanding of the reservoirs, fluxes, mechanisms, and climatic effects of deep carbon recycling following an integrated methodology of observation, experiment, and numerical modeling, with the aim of decoding the self-regulating Earth system and its habitability from the deep carbon recycling perspective.

Abstract Low carbon transition strategies of power plants are crucial to meet China’s “Dual Carbon” targets. While the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, the “capital economic circles” of China, is suffering from serious air pollution, air quality co-benefits of low carbon transition policies in electricity system in BTH area remain unclear. Here, we estimate the impacts of low carbon transition policies, including one BAU, six single and five combined scenarios, in electricity system in BTH area on installed power capacity, CO2 emissions, air quality and human health through 2060 based on OSeMOSYS and ERSM models. Results show that the total installed capacity under single and combined scenarios (except RE and Tech single scenarios) fluctuates around the BAU level of 310.5 GW in 2060. While all single and combined scenarios would generally achieve “carbon peak” in BTH electricity system before 2030, only S4 (combining technological progress, renewable energy development and CCUS) and S5 (in additional to S4, including gas-fired power generation instead of coal-fired power generation) scenarios have the potential to realize carbon neutrality by 2060. The magnitude of reductions in air pollutant emissions and improvement in air quality in BTH area from the BAU level in 2060 under combined scenarios, especially S4 and S5, generally exceed that of six single scenarios. Importantly, S5 in 2060 contributes to about 8,528 avoided premature mortalities in BTH area, which are more effective than any other scenarios. The results suggest that S5 is a promising low carbon transition policies to achieve environmental improvement and produce health benefits.

Low-enthalpy geothermal energy can make a major contribution towards reducing CO2 emissions. However, the development of geothermal reservoirs is costly and time intensive. In particular, high capital expenditures, data acquisition costs, and long periods of time from identifying a geothermal resource to geothermal heat extraction make geothermal field developments challenging. Conventional geothermal field development planning follows a linear approach starting with numerical model calibrations of the existing subsurface data, simulations of forecasts for geothermal heat production, and cost estimations. Next, data acquisition actions are evaluated and performed, and then the models are changed by integrating the new data before being finally used for forecasting and economics. There are several challenges when using this approach and the duration of model rebuilding with the availability of new data is time consuming. Furthermore, the approach does not address sequential decision making under uncertainty as it focuses on individual data acquisition actions. An artificial intelligence (AI)-centric approach to field development planning substantially improves cycle times and the expected rewards from geothermal projects. The reason for this is that various methods such as machine learning in data conditioning and distance-based generalized sensitivity analysis assess the uncertainty and quantify its potential impact on the final value. The use of AI for sequential decision making under uncertainty results in an optimized data acquisition strategy, a recommendation of a specific development scenario, or advice against further investment. This approach is illustrated by applying AI-centric geothermal field development planning to an Austrian low-enthalpy geothermal case. The results show an increase in the expected value of over 27% and a reduction in data acquisition costs by more than 35% when compared with conventional field development planning strategies. Furthermore, the results are used in systematic trade-off assessments of various key performance indicators.

This provides opportunities to develop sustainability initiatives to reduce environmental impacts. GOR initiatives require buy-in and execution from various stakeholders, including hospital administration, clinical staff, and support teams. Our objective is to share easy-to-implement strategies that reduce costs and improve sustainability through reductions in environmental/climate impact in the OR that Urologists' can lead. METHODS: A retrospective assessment of a single large cancer center's GOR efforts from a prospectively maintained sustainability dashboard. RESULTS: In 2022, our GOR initiative saved 1.8 million kWh in electricity, decreased greenhouse gas emissions by 148%, avoided 150 tons of waste, and recycled 14,000 kbs of single-use devices (SUD) leading to an overall savings of $1,112,505 (Figure 1). A few high-impact easily implemented initiatives contributing to savings include: Energy consumption: Computer power on/off software programs, turning off OR monitors/lights at the end of the day, switching OR lights to LED, and HVAC (air exchange) setbacks using CO2 sensors to decrease exchanges when the room is not in use. Waste reduction: Standardizing case carts, switching from single-use-plastic to reusable equipment, recycling SUD (ligatures, staplers, blood pressure cuffs, O2 sensors, compression devices, etc.), recycling/repurposing sterile blue wrap, and donating unwanted medical equipment. Anesthetic gases: Reducing Nitrous oxide, desflurane, sevoflurane, and isoflurane use, and increasing the use of monitored sedation or regional anesthesia, when possible, helps reduce anesthetic gas use. Education and collaboration: Educating staff by placing recycling signage in every OR, using color-coded recycling bin/bags to help with waste segregation, nominating champions within OR staff, environmental services, and other stakeholders helps align everyone toward a common goal and identify areas for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: We present easily implemented high-impact GOR initiatives aligned with industry best practices that any Urologist can initiate to kickstart a GOR program in their own organization and reduce the environmental/climate impacts of healthcare in their community.

While important, testing can be costly, unnecessary and burdensome to patients to obtain G&S in a short timeframe due to expiry. We aimed to assess and reduce unnecessary G&S testing in a safe and collaborative manner through a Transfusion Dashboard. We assessed the effect of reduced G&S testing on cost and the environment. METHODS: The Transfusion Dashboard (TD), launched at UBC in 2020, is a quality improvement initiative which tracks procedure-specific transfusion rates. Based on initial findings, recommendations for pre-operative G&S for endoscopic procedures were developed. We reviewed incidence of G&S testing, perioperative transfusion rates and rescue transfusion rates (when a patient without G&S needs urgent, uncrossed transfusion) in endourological procedures before and after the implementation of this initiative with the chi-squared test. We also assessed cost and environmental savings. RESULTS: From 2016-2023, outcomes were tracked for 4393 pre-TD initiative and 2058 post-TD initiative patients who underwent endoscopic procedures (Table 1). We found a statistically significant decrease in G&S testing post-TD for TURP, PNL, HoLEP, and TURBT by as much as 63.6% (Table 1, p<0.001). There was no change in uncrossed or overall blood transfusions (0% for all groups). In 2022, for TURP alone, this resulted in a total saving of $1947 and reduction of 40Kg in CO2 emissions by eliminating 75 patient visits to the laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: Institutional and procedure specific G&S testing guidelines decrease unnecessary tests, leading to improved resource stewardship, reduced cost, respecting patients' time, and environmental savings. While the cost savings per group is modest, care improvements may be amplified safely in larger organizations and across more procedures.

The climate crisis and loss of biodiversity, two closely related threats to human and planetary health, meet the criteria for the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare an international public health emergency, as occurred with COVID-19 (1), and urged by numerous scientific journals (2). Attaining decent work, understood as "opportunities for women and men to work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity" (3), in the context of the climate emergency, creates a paradox for worker health. Outdoor workers (notably those in agriculture and construction), many of them informal workers, are among the populations most vulnerable to climate-related hazards. Simultaneously, they are inevitably at risk of exposure due to their role in maintaining the economy and functioning of society. A similar situation happened during the pandemic with essential workers (4). The WHO declaration of a public health emergency helped manage that global crisis. A consequence of the industrial revolution The current climate crisis is a direct consequence of the Industrial Revolution where key processes emerged to explain the current situation: the appearance of wage labor and the working class, with consumerism as a basic economic driver, and the exploitation of natural resources – especially fossil fuels – in their own territories and in the colonies. The extension of this capitalist model of society to virtually the entire planet is a reality. Now, we see how this economic system has brought both great harm and significant benefits. Since its beginning, capitalism has wrought great suffering for people, masterfully described, among others, by Fredrich Engels in the Manchester of 1845 (5) or the London of 1838 in Charles Dickens` Oliver Twist (6). Although working conditions have since improved in many countries, there are still unbearable examples worldwide of worker exploitation and suffering. Among them, child labor, where 70% are working in agriculture (7) or some underregulated platform work (8), in a context of ever-increasing social inequalities (9). On the other hand, due to improved working and life conditions, there has also been an extraordinary increase in the world population, from one billion at the beginning of the 19th century to approximately eight billion today, leading to a linear increase in life expectancy at birth, which doubled globally between the beginning of the 20th century and the present. In 2015, the Lancet Commission on Planetary Health (10) pointed out that never before has humanity faced such an unintended paradox. While human well-being has been improving, the planet has been degrading. A contradiction that can no longer be sustained. We have lived as if our planet`s resources are unlimited. Based on comparisons to average temperature readings of the planet between 1850 and 1900, the United Nations International Panel on Climate Change estimated in its latest report that temperatures increased by 1.1° C between 2011 and 2020. This increase is very close to the 1.5° C established by the 2015 Paris Agreement as the limit beyond which climate impacts may become irreversible. Beyond any reasonable doubt, this is mostly attributable to the greenhouse effect produced by CO2 emissions, a consequence mainly of human activity and our way of living initiated by the Industrial Revolution. This global increase in temperature, with heat waves, floods and other extreme temperature events as its most obvious manifestations, is already having effects on worker health (12, 13). Climate change is also having effects on the economy and the labor market, both in the primary (agriculture and fishing) and services (tourism) sectors, with reductions in productivity and employment. Estimates from the European Commission reveal an average loss of 3% of GDP among EU countries between 1980 and 2020 (14). Simultaneously, we should not forget that the capitalist society that emerged from the Industrial Revolution is based, among other pillars, on full or near full employment. As such, wages represent the main economic resource for the majority of people, in addition to being the primary source of wealth generation for society, on whose income and taxes the welfare state was built. Of course, employment means much more than wage earning, as it plays a fundamental role in the social processes that sustain human dignity and social cohesion (15). However, only approximately 50% of the employed population, mainly in high-income countries, enjoy decent employment with a living wage and social rights (16). The resulting Gordian knot before us is enormous, with humanity facing the climate emergency and trying to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, while simultaneously seeking to maintain and increase decent employment for all Earth`s inhabitants, boosting the welfare states at the same time (17). Controlling climate-related hazards and just green transition The alternatives proposed to escape this crossroads vary between those that propose a new paradigm, which radically changes the current economic model, betting on measures that break drastically from the capitalist economy (18), versus a gradual process, supported by mitigation, adaptation, and compensation policies (19). Favoring this second alternative, but without ruling out the need to profoundly change human consumption patterns with important repercussions on the productive system (energy, transportation, food, etc.), gradualist policies will also directly or indirectly impact employment and working conditions during the transition from carbon emission energy to green energy. To cope with this urgent situation, specific control measures have been proposed over the last few decades. Schulte and colleagues have systematically reviewed the literature (20, 21, 22), identifying new and exacerbated old climate-related hazards such as extreme temperatures, air pollution, ultraviolet radiation, natural disasters, biological hazards, indoor air quality, etc., and they also assessed the impact of employment transition and economic burden on occupational health equity and mental health. On this basis, the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has elaborated recommendations to mitigate and control the impact of several climate-related hazards on worker health and well-being (23). Similarly, the EU Agency for Safety and Health at Work has published guidelines for heat at work (24). Going further, some governments, such as Spain, have begun regulating and enforcing specific measures (25). Implementation of these workplace preventive measures to mitigate the impact of climate change is the responsibility of employers, with full participation of workers. Devoting resources to hazard recognition; performing risk assessments to identify which workers are most vulnerable to climate change-related hazards; and implementing a control strategy with policies, procedures, equipment, and work organization changes aiming to eliminate or minimize the impact of these hazards can improve employer preparedness (26). Adaptation policies to reduce emissions of CO2 and other gases that are driving the greenhouse effect, still with limited results, could mean a loss of six million jobs worldwide, according to estimates of the International Labor Organization (ILO) (27). This same estimation predicts a promising creation of 24 million jobs, mainly in economies emphasizing recycling and reutilization of manufactured products (the so-called "circular economy"), infrastructure construction, development of renewables and energy efficiency. Also, during this transition, new forms of work will emerge (e.g., human-robot interfaces and artificial intelligence), and with them the need to train workers, both new and existing, to adapt to those new forms of work. While waiting for positive results from mitigation and adaptation policies, a just transition to a green economy must simultaneously incorporate compensation policies. To achieve this, it is essential to strengthen social protection systems, a cornerstone of decent employment. For example, there were measures adopted during the pandemic, such as temporary employment regulation for employees or benefits covering the cessation of activity of the self-employed. Similar compensation measures may help workers affected by mitigation and adaptation policies during a transition phase, possibly to a lesser degree than in the pandemic, but lasting longer. In summary, as was the case in the most recent public health emergency, the COVID-19 pandemic, declaring the climate emergency as an international public health emergency by the WHO could play a critical role in managing this new global health crisis. Research programs, supported by global occupational health surveillance systems, to monitor the effectiveness of mitigation, adaptation and compensation measures are urgent.
