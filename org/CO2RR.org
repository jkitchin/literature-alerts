Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are considered as promising catalytic materials for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (ECR) reactions due to their excellent properties. However, the development of efficient and stable electrocatalysts within a wide potential window remains a great challenge. Herein, the rod-like Sn-MOF is synthesized by a fast and simple solution reaction, which has good performance in converting CO 2 to HCOOH. In particular, Sn-MOF reaches a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 86.4% at −1.15 V vs RHE with a current density of 25.2 mA cm −2 . It is worth noting that Sn-MOF has excellent long-term stability, maintaining more than 80% of FE HCOOH production within 30 h of continuous electrolysis. Meanwhile, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization confirm that Sn 2+ in Sn-MOF can be reduced to Sn 0 in the ECR reaction. The theoretical results show that *COOH intermediate tends to form in the ECR process on Sn-MOF, and it has a high selectivity for the formation of HCOOH. In addition, the two-electrode system driving the co-electrolysis of methanol and CO 2 can significantly reduce the voltage by 500 mV at a current density of 20 mA cm −2 .

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) technology seamlessly integrates and optimizes the merits of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis, facilitating charge separation and enhancing solar conversion efficiency. It stands out as a promising approach for CO2 treatment. GaN as III-Ⅴ semiconductor, has garnered substantial attention in the realm of PEC CO2 reduction reactions (RR). In this study, GaN and In/GaN micro-rods were prepared via straightforward hydrothermal synthesis. Attaining a current density of approximately 10 mA/cm2 and CO Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of ~45% at -0.75 VRHE (Reversible Hydrogen Electrode, RHE), In/GaN exhibited exceptional stability over a 2 h PEC CO2 RR. The introduction of In into GaN significantly augmented CO2 adsorption capacity and light harvesting. Additionally, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations elucidated that In-doped GaN can diminish the adsorption of intermediate CO, favoring subsequent CO desorption. Furthermore, the N-vacancy increased with In doping, resulting in a rise in the number of unpaired electrons, facilitating carrier transport. Herein, vibration energy harvester was introduced to drive CO2 RR, marking a significant advancement in development of PEC CO2 RR for future green energy applications.

The development of high-efficiency catalysts plays a crucial role in advancing CO2 electroreduction techniques. Among potential candidate, diamond-based electrocatalysts show promise due to their broad electrochemical windows, which effectively suppress competitive hydrogen evolution and ensure high CO2 reduction efficiency. In this study, we report an integrated electrode composed of oxygen-terminated diamond nanocone (ODcone) with CoPc-molecules anchoring (CoPc/ODcone). The CoPc/ODcone electrodes exhibited remarkable performance, achieving a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94.1% for CO at −0.97 V vs. RHE, and maintaining an FECO higher than 80% over a wide potential range of −0.67 V to −1.07 V vs. RHE. The outstanding performance of the CoPc/ODcone electrode can be attributed to the synergistic effects between the nanostructured diamond surface and the CoPc catalyst. The hydroxyl-rich nature of the diamond surface facilitates the anchoring of CoPc molecules and bonding with Co atoms in CoPc. Simultaneously, the nanostructured diamond with sharp tips enhances CO2 adsorption, thereby improving the catalyst's performance. This study provides valuable insights into the utilization of non-metallic carbon materials, particularly diamond, as metal-free catalysts in CO2 electrochemical reduction and tackles challenges such as low current density and poor Faradaic efficiency, thus contributing to the advancement of more effective catalysts for CO2 electroreduction.

Abstract Due to new environmental and cost challenges in the oil and gas industry, operators are looking for solutions to save costs and reduce their CO2 footprint. The main objective of this project was to find a solution to save time in the plug and abandonment (P&A) operation and reduce the CO2 footprint in a manner that can be applied in future P&A operations in the Norwegian Waters. The first step was to perform a detailed engineering analysis of the new solution, comparing it with the standard P&A technique. Technical requirements, associated costs, additional risks, equipment, NORSOK D010 requirements and blend designs were considered. After this analysis, the decision was made to go for the new P&A solution. This implied placing one long cement plug in one go (1425m) using a sacrificial drill pipe and a disconnect tool. The cement plug was tailored to achieve competent slurry properties for the job, such as fluid loss (FL), free fluid (FF), thickening time (TT), wait on cement (WOC), etc. Pre-job laboratory tests were conducted to assess the suitability of this blend for the new technique. The project was then planned, and the proper tools, equipment, and slurry design were selected for the job. A detailed cost analysis compared a conventional P&A method, which implied placing 5 – 6 plugs, versus the new method of placing one long plug in one go with a sacrificial pipe and a disconnect tool. The HSE aspects were evaluated, significantly reducing rig time, slop generation, CO2 footprint and people's exposure in the red zone. The job was performed as planned, observing normal circulation throughout the whole cement job and a clear indication of the dart landing and the tool release. The well barrier was verified by tagging and pressure test after WOC confirmed hard cement and isolation at the theoretical top of the cement. This new P&A method has been used for five jobs in Norway in the last two years. No issues have been recorded. The tool was disconnected as planned, confirming its reliability. Substantial rig time savings and HSE improvements have been achieved on all jobs so far. Improved HSE and reduced CO2 emissions can be achieved with this new P&A method. The paper will also show the advantage of the tool compared with conventional P&A methods and how important this can be for both environmental improvements and cost reductions.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission has been a global concern over the past few decades due to the increase in the demand of energy, a major source of which is fossil fuels. To mitigate the emission issues, as well as to find a solution for the energy needs, an ample load of research has been carried out over the past few years in CO2 reduction by catalysis. Bismuth, being an active catalyst both photocatalytically and electrocatalytically, is an interesting material that can be formed into oxides, sulphides, oxyhalides, etc. Numerous works have been published based on bismuth-based materials as active catalysts for the reduction of CO2. However, a proper understanding of the behavior of the active facets and the dependence of morphology of the different bismuth-based catalysts is an interesting notion. In this review, various bismuth-based materials will be discussed regarding their activity and charge transfer properties, based on the active facets present in them. With regard to the available literature, a summarization, including photocatalysis, electrocatalysis as well as photoelectrocatalysis, will be detailed, considering various materials with different facets and morphologies. Product selectivity, varying on morphological difference, will also be realized photoelectrochemically.

The mechanistic details of the asymmetric Ni‐catalyzed reductive cyclization/carboxylation of alkenes with CO2 have been revisited using DFT methods. Emphasis was put on the enantioselectivity and the mechanistic role of Lewis acid additives and in situ formed salts. Our results show that oxidative addition of the substrate is rate‐limiting, with the formed Ni(II)‐aryl intermediate preferring a triplet spin state. After reduction to Ni(I), enantioselective cyclization of the substrate occurs, followed by inner sphere carboxylation. Our proposed mechanism reproduces the experimentally observed enantiomeric excess and identifies critical C‐H/O and C‐H/N interactions that affect the selectivity. Further, our results highlight the beneficial effect of Lewis acids on CO2 insertion and suggest that in situ formed salts influence if the 5‐exo or 6‐endo product will be formed.

The insufficient electrocatalytic activity and CO2 resistance hinder the application of cathode material for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). In this study, we introduce a series of Pr-doped perovskite Bi0.8–xPrxCa0.2FeO3–δ (BPCFx, x=0, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20) as candidate cathode materials, with a focus on its phase structure, oxygen desorption ability, catalytic activity, and electrochemical reduction kinetics. Among all the components, the Bi0.6Pr0.2Ca0.2FeO3–δ (BPCF0.20) catalyst shows impressive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity, with a low polarization resistance of 0.06 Ω cm2 at 700 °C and peak power density of 810 mW cm−2 at 800 °C. Moreover, the BPCF0.20 cathode shows outstanding CO2 resistance in different CO2 concentrations (1% ∼ 10%) due to the larger average bond energy and higher relative acidity of Bi, Pr, and Fe ions. These findings demonstrate that BPCFx are advanced cathode electrocatalysts for SOFCs.

Abstract The entropy design paradigm is yielding advanced materials for many societally crucial applications. While most work focuses on single-phase materials, there are vast opportunities to integrate entropy-designed materials into novel composites. Here we develop a nanocomposite design strategy using exsolution-self-assembly to fabricate Cu nanorods in an entropy-stabilized oxide. Atomic-scale electron probes and energetic calculations elucidate how exsolution-self-assembly is tunable using knowledge of point defect interactions. We leverage this to then demonstrate a high-throughput synthesis and screening strategy to fabricate a library of Cu-ESO tandem CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) electrodes. Electrocatalytic mapping and localized physicochemical analyses reveal structure-property relationships between local Cu valence and CO2RR activity, identifying operating potentials and electrode surface chemistries that favor CO2RR over competitive hydrogen evolution. This high-throughput synthesis-screening approach can accelerate development of advanced electrocatalysts and nanocomposite materials for many applications given its compatibility with entropy-designed materials and physical vapor deposition at/near silicon volume manufacturing temperatures.

The rational design of catalysts with atomic dispersion and a deep understanding of the catalytic mechanism is crucial for achieving high performance in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we present an atomically dispersed electrocatalyst with single Cu atom and atomic Ni clusters supported on N-doped mesoporous hollow carbon sphere (CuSANiAC/NMHCS) for highly efficient CO2RR. CuSANiAC/NMHCS demonstrates a remarkable CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) exceeding 90 % across a potential range of − 0.6 to − 1.2 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and achieves its peak FECO of 98 % at − 0.9 V vs. RHE. Theoretical studies reveal that the electron redistribution and modulated electronic structure—notably the positive shift in d-band center of Ni 3d orbital—resulting from the combination of single Cu atom and atomic Ni clusters markedly enhance the CO2 adsorption, facilitate the formation of *COOH intermediate, and thus promote the CO production activity. This study offers fresh perspectives on fabricating atomically dispersed catalysts with superior CO2RR performance.

Despite significant advancements in the investigation of catalyst morphology in electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR), achieving precise control over multi-carbon (C2+) products selectivity remains challenging. Thus, a sequence of catalysts with incorporation of CuO onto three-dimensional (3D) spherical CeO2 were synthesized using a hydrothermal and calcination two-step method. The molar ratios of Cu(NO3)2·H2O to Ce(NO3)3·6H2O can manipulate morphology and oxygen vacancies (Ov) of CuxCey catalysts, further influencing their product distribution in ECR. Materials characterization and electrochemical testing demonstrate that dual effects of spherical morphology and Ov in the CuxCey catalysts can enhance the activity and C2H4 selectivity in ECR. To elaborate further on the topic, the pure CeO2 exhibits excellent Faradaic efficiency (FE) of CH4 with the value of 54.3 %. Cu7Ce3, among all CuxCey catalysts, reaches a maximum value of 37.22 % at −1.2 V vs. RHE, possibly attributed to its highest Ov concentration. More significantly, the possible reaction pathway was monitor by ATR-FTIR technique for CuxCey during ECR is: CO2 → *COOH →*CO → *CHO → *OCCOH → C2H4. The concept of dual tuning strategy by morphology and Ov opens up a wide range of possibilities for the development of effective Cu-based catalysts for ECR.

Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 powered by renewable electricity provides an elegant route for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and feedstocks, but normally suffers from a high overpotential and low selectivity. Herein, Ag and Sn heteroatoms were simultaneously introduced into nanoporous Cu (np‐Ag/Sn‐Cu) mainly in the form of an asymmetric local electric field for CO2 electroreduction to CO in an aqueous solution. The designed np‐Ag/Sn‐Cu catalyst realizes a recorded 90% energy efficiency and a 100% CO Faradaic efficiency over ultrawide potential window (ΔE = 1.4 V), outperforming state‐of‐the‐art Au and Ag‐based catalysts. Density functional theory calculations combined with in situ spectroscopy studies reveal that Ag and Sn heteroatoms incorporated into Cu matrix could generate strong and asymmetric local electric field, which promotes the activation of CO2 molecules, enhances the stabilization of the *COOH intermediate, and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction, thus favoring the production of CO during CO2RR.

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 using copper-based electrocatalysts has emerged as a promising approach for sustainable chemical production, offering a pathway to mitigate the rising atmospheric CO2 levels while generating valuable fuels and chemicals. However, the selectivity and efficiency of copper-based catalysts towards specific C2 products remain a major challenge, hindering their commercial viability. This thesis focuses on the development, characterization, and mechanistic understanding of three promising electrocatalyst systems for multi-carbon product generation from CO2 reduction: copper-phosphide (Cu-P), copper-tin (Cu-Sn), and copper selenide (Cu2Se). A comprehensive investigation of the electrocatalysts was conducted using advanced characterization techniques, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). The electrochemical performance of the electrocatalysts was evaluated under various operating conditions in a zero-gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer, which enables operation at industrially relevant current densities. The Cu-P0.065 electrocatalyst demonstrated a remarkable enhancement in ethylene selectivity, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 52% at a current density of 150 mA cm-2 in 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte. The Cu-Sn0.03 electrocatalyst exhibited a notable shift in selectivity towards ethanol, with an FE of 48% at 350 mA cm-2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte. The Cu2Se electrocatalyst showcased a unique selectivity towards acetate production, achieving an FE of 32% at 350 mA cm-2 in 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte, surpassing the performance of the pure Cu electrode and previously reported Cu-Se electrocatalysts. Durability studies revealed the stability of the electrocatalysts under prolonged CO2 reduction conditions, with the Cu2Se electrocatalyst demonstrating exceptional structural integrity. Thermodynamic considerations based on Pourbaix diagrams highlighted the role of electronegative dopants in stabilizing the desired oxidation states of the electrocatalysts, contributing to their enhanced performance and stability. This thesis advances the understanding of CO2 reduction mechanisms for multi-carbon products on Cu-based electrocatalysts and provides valuable insights into the rational design of efficient and selective electrocatalysts. The development of the Cu-P0.065, Cu-Sn0.03, and Cu2Se electrocatalysts, with their remarkable selectivity, stability, and activity, represents a significant step forward in the field of electrochemical CO2 reduction.

The effect of the CO2:C2H6 feed ratio, the relative Lewis acidity of reducible and unreducible catalytically active metal oxide supports with and without Fe3Ni1 alloy nanoparticles on the activity, selectivity and stability for the CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (CO2-ODHE) is investigated. To circumvent the influence of the typically dissimilar textural properties of the supports in bulk form, overlayer oxide supports of V, Cr, Ga, Ti or Sm coated on a common γ-Al2O3 carrier were employed. Separately, (Ni0.75Fe0.25)Fe2O4 precursor nanoparticles were synthesized via a nonaqueous surfactant-free method, sonication-deposited onto supports and reduced in situ into an Fe3Ni1 alloy microstructure of bcc and fcc mixed phases captured with in situ XRD. When exposed to carbon dioxide at 255 °C, a selective re-oxidation of the bcc phase via CO2 dissociation is observed, while the fcc phase stays stable and only partially re-oxidizes above 525 °C. Upon exposure to CO2-ODHE conditions, the initial activity of the bare supports increases with increasing acid site strength, but this activity is rapidly lost in case of the strongly acidic supports. Comparison of the C2H4 and CO selectivity indicate direct dehydrogenation is preferred over the oxidative dehydrogenation pathway and is initially occurring in combination with some CO-forming routes, possibly the dry reforming of C2H6. This CO forming route is significant over the most acidic and reducible VOx@Al2O3 support in the early stages of operation. The addition of the Fe3Ni alloy increases the conversions of both C2H6 and CO2 across all supports, with a notably stronger effect observed on CO2 conversion especially over the highly acidic and reducible VOx@Al2O3 and CrOx@Al2O3. As a result, the CO selectivity is increased due to ethane dry reforming activity over the latter supports while CO2-ODHE activity is observed over the supports with intermediate and weak acid sites.

Ruthenium CNC pincer complexes, comprised of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and a pyridyl ring, are highly active catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction. We hypothesized that the addition of long chain aliphatic groups with an olefin terminus as wingtips on these CNC pincers could be used to form macrocyclic catalysts by ring closing metathesis (RCM). We have synthesized three new ruthenium pincer catalysts, [(CNC)Ru(CH3CN)2Cl]OTf, containing a long chain olefin wingtip (4A-4C, where R = H, Me, OMe para to N on the pyridine ring) and performed RCM on 4B, followed by hydrogenation, to form a novel macrocyclic ruthenium catalyst, 6B. These four catalysts were tested for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 in the presence (sensitized) and absence (self-sensitized) of an external photosensitizer. With a photosensitizer, these catalysts produced mostly CO (775 to 1210 TON) with smaller amounts of H2 also formed. The methyl substituted macrocyclic catalyst 6B showed a TON of 1185 for CO over 72 hours compared to a TON of 775 for CO for the acyclic catalyst 4B. The remote substituents at the para-position of the central pyridine ring significantly influence catalyst activity with R = OMe > H = Me.

Review Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate Electrocatalytic C-N Coupling for Sustainable Production of Urea Litao Jia, and Fanghua Li * School of Environment, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150090, China * Correspondence: fanghuahope01@hit.edu.cn Received: 15 December 2023; Revised: 17 January 2024; Accepted: 19 February 2024; Published: 5 March 2024 Abstract: The electrocatalytic co-reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3−) for urea synthesis under environmental conditions offers a promising solution for achieving sustainable environmental management. Besides, electrochemical urea synthesis is an alternative approach for cleaner production of urea compared to the conventional urea industrial production process with high energy consumption and pollution. However, lower urea yield, lower selectivity and unclear C-N coupling reaction mechanism are still the main challenges to its large-scale application. In this review, we focus on accurate and reliable detection methods and evaluation criteria for urea products, recent progress on CO2 and NO3− electrocatalytic co-reduction synthesis of urea, rational design of high-performance electrocatalysts, and C-N coupling reaction mechanism of urea electrochemical synthesis under atmospheric conditions. This review could contribute to the development of electrochemical urea synthesis via effective remediation of CO2 and NO3−.

In this work, we introduce ZeroCarbon - ZC, a startup focused on contributing to the reduction of environmental impact through the neutralization of carbon emissions from online purchases. Our process involves connecting individuals who wish to make online purchases with affiliated companies to contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. These purchases are neutralized through carbon credits that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The use of ZC’s platform has mitigated environmental impacts, as we neutralized 169,000 kilograms of CO2 from purchases made by 8,000 users, in partnership with 224 affiliated stores. Unlike other similar service options on the market, ZeroCarbon calculates only the emissions related to the type of product purchased. This work offers insights on the carbon footprints of conventional and online retail from a ”natureback” perspective.

Abstract. Wildfires release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change and causing severe impacts on air quality and human health. Including carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from wildfires in international assessments and national emission reduction responsibilities is crucial for global carbon reduction and environmental governance. In this study, based on a bottom-up approach and using satellite data, combined with emission factor and aboveground biomass data for different vegetation cover types (forest, shrub, grassland, cropland), the dynamic changes in CO2 emissions from wildfires in China from 2001 to 2022 were analyzed. The results showed that between 2001 and 2022, the total CO2 emissions from wildfires in China were 693.7 Tg (1 Tg = 1012 g), with an annual average of 31.5 Tg. The CO2 emissions from cropland and forest fires were relatively high, accounting for 46 % and 32 %, respectively. The yearly variation in CO2 emissions from forest and shrub fires showed a significant downward trend, while emissions from grassland fires remained relatively stable. In contrast, the CO2 emissions from cropland fires showed a clear upward trend. High CO2 emissions from wildfires were mainly concentrated in the eastern regions of Heilongjiang and Inner Mongolia Provinces in China, accounting for 44 % of the total annual emissions. Various factors such as daily cumulative sunshine hours (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, forest: -0.41, shrub:0.25; p < 0.001) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; Spearman’s correlation coefficient, forest: -0.35, shrub: 0.37; p < 0.001), influenced CO2 emissions from forest and shrub fires. Moreover, temperature (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, -0.45, p < 0.001) primarily affected CO2 emissions from grassland fires. The CO2 emissions from cropland fires negatively correlated with the gross domestic product (GDP) (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, -0.52, p < 0.001) and population density (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, -0.51, p < 0.001). China's policy management has been crucial in reducing CO2 emissions from wildfires. By accurately assessing CO2 emissions from wildfires, governments worldwide can better set CO2 reduction targets, take corresponding measures, and contribute to the global response to climate change.

Air pollution is a critical issue impacting urban environments, leading to severe health problems and environmental degradation. This comprehensive review examines the potential of green systems—specifically green walls, active green walls, and urban greenery systems—to mitigate atmospheric pollutants such as particulate matter (PM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and carbon dioxide (CO2). By systematically analyzing 44 recent studies, the review highlights the pollutant capture efficiency of various green technologies and plant species in both indoor and outdoor settings. Active green walls, particularly those utilizing plant species such as Chlorophytum comosum and Sansevieria trifasciata, were found to be highly effective, with VOC reduction efficiencies up to 96.34%, PM reductions by 65.42%, and CO2 reduction rates reaching 4.8% under optimal conditions. The review identifies key strengths in current research, including diverse experimental setups and the use of sophisticated measurement techniques, but also notes significant limitations such as variability in experimental conditions and a lack of long-term performance data. The study underscores the importance of proper maintenance to sustain green systems&#039; efficacy and highlights the potential issue of pollutant resuspension, which remains under-researched. Practical implications for urban planning are discussed, advocating for the integration of effective green systems into urban infrastructure to enhance air quality and public health. Recommendations for future research include the need for standardized metrics, long-term studies, economic feasibility analyses, and real-world validation of simulation models to better understand and optimize green systems for urban air pollution mitigation.

The use of biodiesel for common rail direct injection (CRDI) diesel engines is very difficult, because its viscosity affects on CRDI systems leading to the high engine knock. Thus, the main aim of the research is to study the performance and emission characteristics of a CRDI diesel engine at a constant speed of 1,500 rpm and different loads, operated with diesel mixed with palm-oil biodiesel at 20% (B20) combined with adding alcohols (5% of ethyl acetate and bioethanol increased from 5 to 20%). Results of exhaust emissions and performance parameters from using B20-bioethanol-ethyl acetate blends compared with fuel baselines (regular diesel and B20) were changed. The B20-bioethanol-ethyl acetate blends increased the releases of carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitric oxide (NO) but the reduction of carbon monoxide (CO) and black smoke (BS) compared with fuel baselines. Meanwhile, performance parameters from using these fuel blends were different. Outstandingly, B20 mixed with 5% of bioethanol and 5% of ethyl acetate had the highest engine performance and the lowest CO and BS emissions, but it released the CO2 and NO levels higher than fuel baselines.

Abstract This paper assesses the role of natural gas in the global energy transition and industrial decarbonization, specifically in the power and industrial sectors, where natural gas holds substantial importance both at present and well into the future. An overview of the current societal relevance of natural gas will be presented, and an assessment of natural gas contributions to global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions/reductions will be presented. The opportunities and repercussions of fuel switching is illustrated through a detailed case study in the United States highlighting the importance of Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) for natural gas to have a more significant role in energy transitions and decarbonization efforts. This research presents a comprehensive approach, combining data analysis, literature review, and development of a case study to examine the significance of natural gas on the energy transition. Methods include assessing the share of natural gas in global emissions and analyzing fuel switching scenarios. The study draws on data from open sources such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), Our World in Data and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to support its findings and conclusions. Natural gas, while contributing significantly to global CO2 emissions, emerges as a crucial transitional fuel for reducing emissions in the short term. Fuel switching, particularly from coal to natural gas, is identified as a key strategy for achieving immediate emission reductions. But the switch implies an increase in demand for natural gas. The study reveals that the United States (U.S.) has witnessed substantial emissions reductions through coal-to-gas switching, emphasizing the economic and environmental benefits. However, the ultimate goal remains a shift towards electrification and low-carbon sources for long-term sustainability. CCUS becomes crucial in advancing sustainable power and heat within the energy and industrial sectors and can be deployed with appropriate policy frameworks and incentives using current technology and infrastructure, making it a crucial bridge to decarbonization. This research introduces insights into the cooperative relationship between coal, natural gas, renewables and the role of CCUS, emphasizing their complementary roles in energy transitions. The potential of natural gas as a flexible and reliable transition energy source is explored, particularly in the U.S. industrial sector. The study also delves into the role of CCUS in decarbonizing power and heat generated by the use of natural gas in power generation and industrial settings. The need for a phased approach to energy transitions and policy support is highlighted. Research funding, financial incentives or carbon cap, and greenhouse gases (GHG) reporting are essential components for advancing carbon capture technologies. The study concludes by emphasizing the evolving role of natural gas in the context of global, regional, and national climate objectives, considering factors such as technology advancements, market conditions, policy support and necessary timelines for substantive reductions in CO2 emissions required by intergovernmental agreements such as the Paris Accord.

Dam reservoirs are exposed to a loss of water storage capacity due to the phenomenon of siltation. This particularity can be expressed by the siltation of reservoirs and the entrainment of particles transported by watercourses. Siltation of reservoirs is a critical state which causes a reduction in the storage capacity of dams. Algeria is characterized by a semi-arid climate, which annually loses a considerable volume of water storage. The carbonation of concrete is influenced by a number of parameters which accelerate its kinetics. These parameters are the porosity of the concrete, the quantity of lime contained in the cement, the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and the humidity of the environment. It should be noted that, water being the vector for moving aggressive agents, carbon dioxide can only diffuse through the concrete if the latter is not completely saturated and not perfectly dry at the same time. Another factor increasing the permeability of concrete is the amount of limestone added to the cement during its manufacture at the factory. This permeability allows the diffusion of CO2 or other aggressive agents in the concrete. The addition of limestone to cement must therefore be used with caution. The objective is to propose economically competitive and easy-to-implement formulations which allow the valorization of these materials in the making of ordinary concrete by partial substitution of cement (10, 20 and 30%) and its influence on the progress of long-term carbonation after six years of curing in the open air. The sediment is treated by calcination at 750°C to make it active. Natural carbonation tests were carried out on the study concretes in order to evaluate their durability. The results obtained confirmed the possibility of producing concretes incorporating calcined sludge at dosages of up to 30% without compromising the quality of these concretes from the point of view of behavior in the face of attacks by the dissolution of carbon dioxide from the air in the interstitial solution of concrete, meeting economic, ecological and technological objectives.

Abstract The oil and gas industry faces mounting pressure to reduce its environmental footprint, particularly concerning greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions contributing to climate change. Drilling operations represent a significant source, accounting for an estimated 11.6% of emissions within the industry's upstream activities. This study investigates quantifying the potential reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and overall environmental impact by transitioning from nonaqueous (oil/synthetic-based) to aqueous (water-based) drilling fluids. A multi-phase analysis was conducted to develop a comprehensive carbon emissions calculator for the entire lifecycle of nonaqueous fluids used in deep-water drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Across six lifecycle stages, from raw material transportation to disposal/reuse, the calculator quantifies CO2 emissions based on activity data and emission factors. Preliminary findings indicate rig operations (62%) and solids control/cuttings management (29%) contribute 91% of total calculated emissions. Case studies are presented demonstrating the emissions reduction potential of aqueous fluids. In the Gulf of Mexico, sustainable water-based mud eliminated operational steps like pit cleaning compared to nonaqueous fluids, reducing associated emissions. For a 12-well campaign in the Permian Basin, aqueous fluids reduced drilling days per well from 20 to 13 on average versus nonaqueous, resulting in a 37% reduction in CO2 emissions. The study proposes adapting this calculator framework to model representative aqueous fluid systems, enabling direct comparison of emissions profiles across all stages. Aqueous fluids’ inherent nature suggests reducible impacts through lower transportation volumes, less energy-intensive preparation, enhanced drilling performance, minimized rig time, and more straightforward waste management. However comprehensive comparative data is ongoing, aqueous fluids demonstrate compelling potential to lower the substantial carbon footprint associated with drilling activities. This rigorous methodology enables evidence-based decisions on drilling fluid selection to align with sustainability initiatives and improve environmental stewardship. The study proposes adapting this calculator framework to model a representative aqueous fluid system for the same drilling application. The potential environmental benefit achieved by using an aqueous fluid can be quantified by directly comparing the emissions profiles across all lifecycle stages. Aqueous fluids are expected to reduce impacts through lower transportation volumes, less energy-intensive preparation, enhanced drilling performance, minimized rig time, and more straightforward waste management. While comprehensive data is still needed for the complete comparative analysis, the inherent nature of aqueous fluids strongly suggests they offer a viable pathway to lowering the carbon footprint associated with drilling activities. This study establishes the foundational methodology to evaluate such environmental impacts rigorously, enabling operators to make informed decisions when selecting drilling fluid systems to improve sustainability practices.

Abstract Current liquid sorbents for CO2 capture in post-combustion gas mixtures are based on aqueous solutions of aliphatic alkanolamines, which react with carbon dioxide by forming carbamates. Regeneration of sorbents is therefore energy intensive. The present work shows that aromatic amines can be used advantageously, because of their lower energy demand. CO2 capture experiments are carried out in batch mode, allowing gas to flow into the headspace of a reactor at various pressures and temperatures. Sorption kinetics by the present liquid sorbents are measured by integrating data from a mass flow meter. Tests were conducted under two different pressures (10-20 bar) and temperatures (10-20 °C) for 4M water-ethanol solutions of the aromatic amines. CO2 sorption profiles show faster capture kinetics as the temperature and pressure, independently, increase. Alkylated derivatives are generally faster at sorbing CO2, while sorption amounts at the equilibrium are comparable for several species. Desorption/regeneration of sorbents occurred at a much lower temperature (30 °C) than with common alkanolamines. 80% saturation of some of the sorbents is very fast, being reached in 1-3 minutes. Loading capacities up to 200 mg CO2/g of sorbent solution (4.5 mol CO2/kg solvent) were observed. Energy demand calculations show how the present systems are much cheaper than those based on carbamate-forming sorbents. We propose that such energy savings may be invested in pressurization of a post-combustion flue gas, leading to the possibility of application of imidazole-based sorbents to this industrial process. In fact, it is shown that the energy burden added for pressurization is more than overcome by the drastic reduction of the sorption/desorption temperatures. This cooler process also decreases the corrosion potential of the sorbent.

Abstract Sustainable development demands a fundamental transformation in energy generation, requiring innovations in subsurface management and geomaterial manufacturing. Cement plays a crucial role in facilitating this transition on two fronts. Firstly, as carbon dioxide (CO2) storage emerges as a promising strategy for mitigating emissions from large-scale industrial operations, its effective implementation relies not only on identifying suitable reservoirs with proven storage capacities but also on the performance of wellbore cement in providing long-term mechanical and hydraulic sealing. Secondly, the production of cement demands an environmentally conscious alternative to traditional Portland cement (PC) capable of both curbing CO2 emissions during the calcination process and bolstering the resilience of wellbore casing under pressure. Our research adopts a dual-pronged approach. We investigate the chemical interactions between supercritical CO2 and cement, analyzing their effects on cement porosity, permeability, strength, and failure mechanisms. Concurrently, we explore the properties of a low-carbon cement formulation derived from a volcanic blend composition. This formulation aims to reduce reliance on limestone as a primary resource, thus cutting emissions and minimizing reactivity with CO2. Our findings reveal that exposure to CO2 triggers well-documented carbonation reactions in Portland-based cement, commonly used in older and legacy wells. These reactions lead to calcite mineralization within the cement pore space, resulting in decreased porosity, reduced permeability, and increased strength. While these outcomes show promise for effectively sealing stored CO2 and furthering sustainability goals, it is crucial to note that increased strength does not necessarily correlate with improved toughness. Our findings underscore that calcite mineralization exacerbates cement brittleness and damage, evident from crack propagation detected through acoustic emissions (AEs) monitoring. Over time, crack development worsens fluid flow and heightens the susceptibility of calcite to dissolution in the presence of acidic fluids generated by continuous CO2 injection. Conversely, the volcanic-based formulation yielded lightweight cement samples with density ranging from 1100 kg/m3 to 1300 kg/m3 and a remarkable CO2 reduction of up to 85%. The microstructure resulting from the volcanic blend composition enables ductile mechanical behavior, with peak strength and permeability ranging between 30MPa to 46MPa and 680μD to 30μD, respectively, thus appearing promising when cement is exposed to CO2.

The integration of renewable energy sources with fuel synthesis represents a transformative approach to addressing the twin challenges of energy sustainability and climate change. This review presents a conceptual framework for coupling renewable energy technologies, such as solar, wind, and biomass, with fuel synthesis processes to produce sustainable, zero-carbon fuels. The framework emphasizes the use of renewable electricity for water splitting and carbon dioxide reduction, key steps in synthesizing hydrogen and other synthetic fuels. The conceptual framework highlights the importance of advanced catalysts in enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of these chemical reactions. Innovations in nanostructured catalysts, hybrid materials, and biomimetic approaches are discussed for their potential to significantly improve the performance and durability of catalytic processes. Additionally, the framework underscores the role of advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling in understanding and optimizing catalyst behavior. This integration necessitates addressing technical challenges associated with scaling up production processes from laboratory to industrial levels. These challenges include ensuring the stability and longevity of catalysts under operational conditions, managing the intermittency of renewable energy sources, and developing robust systems for capturing and utilizing carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the economic viability of these integrated systems is critical, requiring cost-effective solutions that leverage earth-abundant materials and optimize the overall energy efficiency. The environmental benefits of integrating renewable energy with fuel synthesis are substantial, offering a pathway to significantly reduce carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels. The production of synthetic fuels using renewable energy can lead to a closed carbon cycle, thereby mitigating the impact on climate change and contributing to a sustainable energy future. Future directions in this field involve interdisciplinary research to further enhance catalyst performance, develop new materials, and refine process integration strategies. A roadmap for future development includes prioritizing areas such as improved catalyst design, efficient CO2 capture technologies, and the integration of electrochemical and photochemical systems. This abstract concludes by underscoring the transformative potential of renewable energy-fuel synthesis integration, envisioning a future where sustainable energy practices become the cornerstone of global energy systems.

Abstract Cement manufacture is a significant source of carbon dioxide (Co2) emissions in the building sector. Thus reduction in carbon footprint is need of the day which can be achieved through use of high volume flyash (HVFA) concrete mix which helps in reducing the cement demand in the concrete mix. HVFA mixes offers better life cycle assessment than the conventional Portland cement concrete mix (OPC). In this study, concrete mix of grade M30 to M70 with OPC mix without flyash was compared with the HVFA mix which had 40% and 50%flyash replacement. The mechanical behaviour such as compressive strength in HVFA mix was less as compared with pure OPC mix on an average by 4 MPA also the rapid chloride penetration (RCPT) was found less than when compared with pure OPC mix for all grades of concrete. For M30 grade of concrete the RCPT values were 1412 coulomb which was less as compared with OPC mix, while the RCPT values with HVFA mix for M35, M40 M45, M50, M60 and M70 was 1412 coulomb, 1317 coulomb, 1056 coulomb, 1182 coulomb, 990 coulomb, 870 coulomb 991 coulomb respectively. When compared to the HVFA mix, the pure OPC mix’s water absorption showed greater values. M30 grade of concrete the water absorption was 31% less than pure OPC. Similarly for M35, M40, M45, M50, M60 and M70 was 12%, 34% 5%, 34%, 38% and 53% respectively. Hence HVFA mix though had strength less than OPC mixes but delivered excellent durability parameters.

Our current research includes treating the toxicity of wastewater using green algae, and this is done through a set of steps that involve withdrawing nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater for algae to benefit from them in their growth, leading to a clear reduction in their concentrations. Since the algae depend on self-feeding for their living so that they carry out the process of photosynthesis, they thus consume carbon dioxide that is produced from the process of decomposing organic carbon in wastewater by the action of bacteria that work on consuming the oxygen liberated from the algae during the process of photosynthesis, and this leads to reducing carbon dioxide emissions on the one hand and reduces the requirements for ventilation necessary for the work of bacteria on the other hand. Quantitative analysis illustrates that 1.83 grams of carbon dioxide are consumed for every gram of algal biomass. This study highlights the effectiveness of algae as a sustainable and green method for treating wastewater.

This study aims to provide the first report on the soluble and polyphenolic profiles of “Farmacista Honorati” (FH) persimmons, which is a marketed cultivar with no existing data on its nutraceutical value. Total soluble tannins (TSTs) and major soluble (poly)phenols in FH fruits before and after post-harvest commercial treatments with carbon dioxide and ethylene were analyzed. Fruits at commercial harvest had a TST content of 1022 ± 286 mg GAL/100 g d.w. Whereas, after deastringency treatments, an 85% and 83% reduction were observed for carbon dioxide- and ethylene-treated fruits, respectively. Carbon dioxide treatment resulted in the insolubilization of tannins around comparable values in most fruit cultivars, despite the variable soluble tannin content in untreated fruit. By targeted metabolomic profiling, nineteen (poly)phenolic substances were quantified in the investigated untreated and treated fruits. Gallic acid (99 mg/100 g d.w.), (+)-catechin (1.8 mg/100 g d.w.), ellagic acid (1.2 mg/100 g d.w.), and (−)-epicatechin (1.1 mg/100 g d.w.) were the predominant compounds in the untreated FH samples. After the application of post-harvest treatments, a non-nutraceutical relevant decrease of 8-19% in the targeted (poly)phenolic content was generally observed. Ethylene induced the most significant reduction in the individual (poly)phenolic compounds in the FH fruits.

Purpose This study conducts an analysis of the interplay between governance quality, environmental expenditure of the government, and pollution emissions (measured as CO2 emissions) within the BRIC economies. Design/methodology/approach Utilizing the FMOLS model and marginal effects, we investigate the influence of governance quality and environmental expenditure on environmental quality (CO2 emissions) over the period 1996–2020. We took data for Brazil, Russia, India and China. We excluded South Africa due to its due to its small economic size relative to other BRIC economies, sluggish industrial growth and deteriorating foreign trade which gives contrast outliers to our data. Findings Results indicate that government investments in environmental protection contribute to a reduction in CO2 emissions. However, the effectiveness of these expenditures is contingent upon the quality of governance. This underscores the significance of robust governance for realizing meaningful reductions in air pollution through environmental spending. Further, increase in GDP per capita and the industrial sector's share of GDP are associated with a significant rise in CO2 emissions across BRIC economies. Conversely, FDI and trade openness exhibit a negative impact on CO2 emissions, with this effect gaining greater resilience when accounting for governance factors. Research limitations/implications Like any other studies, the present study also suffers from some limitations. First, besides air quality, environmental quality encompasses multiple dimensions and various characteristics such as water purity, noise pollution, open space access, visual effects of buildings etc. But the present study included only CO2 (air quality) as a proxy of environmental quality due to various problems of data and methods. Second, CO2 (carbon dioxide) emission, which is the dependent variable in our model, is actually influenced by various quantitative and qualitative (both natural and man-made) factors. We included only nine independent variables. However, we could not include many variables due to lack of consistent data. Third, this study included only four countries – Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) and excluded South Africa which is a member of the BRICS block due to its economic size, sluggish industrial growth and deteriorating foreign trade which gives contrast outliers to our data set of the four BRIC countries. Therefore, the future research may be carried out by addressing those issues for better understanding of the environmental problems, governance and policies thereon. Practical implications (i) Establish environmental governance committees – The four BRIC countries including South Africa should form a committee comprising government, civil society, and private sector representatives for comprehensive oversight and collaboration in environmental governance. (ii) Invest in capacity building for environmental institutions – Allocate resources to enhance environmental institutions' capacity through training, data improvement, and enforcement strengthening. (iii) Implement green procurement policies – Encourage green procurement in government agencies to drive demand for eco-friendly products and services, promoting sustainable practices. (iv) Incentivize green technology development – Offer tax credits or subsidies to stimulate green technology adoption, including renewable energy and sustainable agriculture. (v) Promote sustainable urban development – Prioritize sustainable urban strategies like public transportation investment and green space promotion to mitigate urbanizations' environmental impacts. (vi) Enhance cross-border cooperation – Foster collaboration on transboundary environmental issues among four BRIC nations including South Africa, including joint research and policy responses. (vii) Promote green finance and investment – Mobilize green finance to support sustainable development projects through instruments like green investment funds and bonds. Originality/value This study distinguishes itself by offering a unique analysis of both individual and combined effects of governance and environmental expenditure on environmental quality. Additionally, it encompasses various dimensions of governance, an aspect rarely explored in the BRIC countries.

A new approach for the thermal reduction of tin dioxide (SnO2) in the carbon/sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) system is demonstrated. The process of tin smelting was experimentally optimized by adjusting the smelting temperature and amounts of the chemical components used for the thermal reduction of SnO2. The numbers obtained are consistent with the thermodynamic characteristics of the system and molar fractions of reactants derived from the proposed mechanism of the SnO2 thermal reduction process. They reveal that the maximum yield of tin is obtained if masses of C, Na2SO3 and SnO2 are approximately in the ratio 1:2:3 and the temperature is set to 1050 °C. The key role in the suggested mechanism is the thermal decomposition of Na2SO3. It was deduced from the available experimental data that the produced sulfur dioxide undergoes carbothermic reduction to carbonyl sulfide—an intermediate product involved in the bulk reduction of SnO2. Replacing sodium sulfite with sodium sulfate, sodium sulfide and even elemental sulfur practically terminated the production of metallic tin. The kinetic analysis was focused on the determination of the reaction orders for the two crucial reactants involved in the smelting process.

Abstract This study focuses on the impact of China’s carbon tax on carbon emission behavior under the background of “double carbon”, using big data simulation analysis. The study utilizes the DICE model, combined with general equilibrium theory, to conduct in-depth theoretical analysis and numerical simulation of the carbon tax policy. It is found that the optimal carbon tax rate should be flexibly adjusted in combination with social and economic development and technological progress, and the optimal tax rate gradually rises from RMB 2.83/tonne of carbon dioxide to RMB 17.62/tonne from 1997 to 2023. Simulation results show that increasing the carbon tax rate can effectively promote the low-carbon emission reduction behavior of enterprises and thus achieve the emission reduction target. Under the fixed carbon tax policy, a 50% tax rate can significantly improve environmental quality and economic output. In contrast, steady-state values of output and carbon emissions decrease with the increase of tax rates. At the same time, the combination of carbon trading and carbon tax can more effectively incentivize enterprises to reduce carbon emissions. The results of the study show that a flexible and reasonable carbon tax policy can significantly affect carbon emission behavior, which is of great significance for realizing China’s “double carbon” goal.

Abstract In China, coal-fired power generation is still the main mode of electricity supply. However, the large amount of coal use exacerbates environmental and sustainability issues. To achieve the “dual-carbon” goal, significant reductions in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from fossil-fueled power generation will be necessary before a transition to cleaner energy can occur. Therefore, the reaction kinetics of the CCLC process was researched by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, which led to the activation energies of 57.58 kJ/mol and -34.26 kJ/mol for the FR and AR reactions. This is of great significance for reducing CO 2 emissions and improving energy conversion efficiency.

Hydrogen is an industrial raw material both for the production of chemicals and for oil refining with hydrotreating. It is the subject of increasing attention for its possible use as an energy carrier and as a flexible energy storage medium. Its production is generally accomplished in Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) plants, where a gaseous mixture of CO and H2, with a limited number of other species, is obtained. The process of production and purification generates relevant amounts of carbon dioxide, which needs to be removed due to downstream process requirements or to limit its emissions to the atmosphere. A work by IEAGHG focused on the study of a state-of-the-art Steam Methane Reforming plant producing 100 kNm3/h of H2 and considered chemical absorption with MethylDiEthanolAmine (MDEA) solvent for removing carbon dioxide from the PSA tail gas in a baseline scheme composed of the absorber, one flash vessel and the regeneration column. This type of process is characterized by high energy consumption, in particular at the reboiler of the regeneration column, usually operated by employing steam, and modifications to the baseline scheme can allow for a reduction of the operating costs, though with an increase in the complexity of the plant. This work analyses three configurations of the treatment section of the off gas obtained after the purification of the hydrogen stream in the Pressure Swing Adsorption unit with the aim of selecting the one which minimizes the overall costs so as to further enhance Carbon Capture and Storage in non-power industries as well.

Abstract A new type of carbon monoxide sensor is designed to address the issue of cross interference of nitrogen oxide gas in the exhaust emissions of underground diesel engine rubber-tired vehicles with electrochemical carbon monoxide sensors, which leads to frequent false alarm accidents. The hardware circuit design of the DC-DC voltage reduction power supply circuit, display circuit, component signal processing circuit, etc. is detailed, At the same time, the sensitive components used in the sensor adopt a special gas filtration membrane design. Six types of gases, including hydrogen sulfide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen, ethylene, and acetylene, were sequentially introduced in the laboratory for experimental analysis of multi-gas cross-interference performance. The experimental results have shown that the new carbon monoxide sensor can filter out nitrogen oxide gas, thereby solving the impact of underground rubber tire vehicle exhaust on the accuracy of carbon monoxide gas detection. It has broad prospects for promotion and application in coal mines underground.

CCUS is internationally recognized as one of the three major pathways to achieve carbon neutrality goals. It is an important choice for realizing zero emissions from large-scale fossil energy utilization and a feasible technological solution to offset carbon emissions in industries such as power, steel, and cement where emissions reductions are challenging. Systematic analysis of the development and policy evolution of the CCUS industry at home and abroad can provide theoretical basis and practical guidance for China&apos;s energy transition and development under the background of carbon emission peaking and achieving carbon neutrality. Guided by the strategic goals of national energy security, carbon emission peaking, and achieving carbon neutrality, this study aims to analyze the global development process and stage characteristics of the CCUS industry, investigate the supporting policies in the CCUS field and their evolution patterns, summarize the current status and trends of the CCUS industry at home and abroad, and provide reference for the implementation of national energy green and low-carbon transformation and the construction of a new energy system. In terms of industry, European and American countries emphasize national-level technological guidance and macro-control. The United States has introduced the progressive 45Q tax credit policy, and the European Union has included CCUS in its carbon trading system. The US National Carbon Capture Center provides a testing environment and facilities for CCUS technology research and development, and has established a carbon dioxide industry cluster and transportation hub. In terms of policies, tax credits and carbon trading policies in Europe and America have attracted various types of capital investment, establishing a relatively complete legal framework system. These regions have been leading in CCUS technology research and deployment, holding dominant positions and decision-making power in mainstream international CCUS organizations such as the CSLF, IEA, GCCSI, and OGCI. This study benchmarks the forward-looking and strategic development status of the CCUS industry at home and abroad, elucidates the challenges facing CCUS industry development, and proposes future trends and policy support needs for the CCUS industry. The research reveals that Europe and America emphasize national-level technological guidance and macro-control, focusing on the construction of regional industrial networks and having established a relatively complete legal and regulatory framework system. Compared to other countries, China needs to establish national-level guidance on CCUS development, regional carbon dioxide capture and transportation networks, and enact specific laws, regulations, and technical standards for CCUS.

Air pollution is the condition of air that is contaminated by the presence of materials, substances or polluting components. One of the causes of air pollution is the combustion or inseneration process because the residue of the process can be released into the air. Based on ISPU, there are five main pollutants, namely: carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), surface ozone (O3), and dust particles (PM10). This study was conducted to reduce the emission of gases. The use of modified cyclone with adsorbent pipe tube from cocoa husk can increase the efficiency of combustion results with adsorption pipe tube modified cyclone. From the results of the study it was found that emissions from incineration can be controlled with APPU in the form of a cyclone. The use of cyclone alone can reduce NOX and CO levels with a reduction in NOX emissions to 53% and CO to 96%. Both emission reductions are in line with the quality standards. However, the use of adsorption pipe tubes showed better efficiency and effectiveness.

The goal of “double carbon” (namely “peak carbon dioxide emissions” and “carbon neutrality”) proposed by China for the first time is an important layout in the Tenth Five-Year Plan, and it is also the key goal to realize the green and sustainable development of mobile communication networks in the future, and it is also the foundation for China’s international carbon asset pricing right and the world carbon trading platform. Among them, the difficulty in realizing green communication lies in maintaining the growth of business volume. Reduce network energy consumption and carbon emissions. This paper studies the green communication technology from the perspective of energy saving and emission reduction on the mobile communication network side and the perspective of the integrated architecture of communication network and multi-energy energy network. The research results show that the key to realize green communication technology lies in the mutual matching of network resources, energy resources and business distribution, while the existing technology can only achieve one-way matching of network resources and business distribution. Or the one-way matching of energy resources and service distribution. Based on this, this paper proposes a native green grid architecture with communication, perception and energy fusion, which has the ability of energy perception and service perception, supports the two-way matching method of network resources, energy resources and service distribution, and realizes the continuous growth of service while significantly reducing the energy consumption and carbon emissions on the mobile communication network side by eliminating the randomness and suddenness of service distribution and energy distribution.

Abstract Escalations in economic development and the concomitant upsurge in social globalization (SG) in the largest economies have enhanced the utilization of fossil fuels, which in turn has stimulated carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. Given that reducing global warming is one of the essential means to disrupt climate change and attain sustainable development, this study examines the interlinkages between SG, energy transition (ENTR), international tourism (ITU), and CO 2 emissions. As environmental issues are widespread in the largest economies, this investigation analyzed the data from the 10 largest economies using the Method of Moments Quantiles Regression (MM‐QR) from 1995 to 2020. The study found that ENTR plays a significant role in decreasing emissions and promoting environmental sustainability. Alongside this, increasing social globalization also curbs CO 2 emissions and facilitates environmental sustainability. Apart from this, the findings demonstrate a progressively increasing contribution of ITU and economic growth to enhancing environmental degradation. Furthermore, results indicated that carbon emissions are not influenced by reductions in political risks in the member nations. Finally, policies to support environmental sustainability are discussed.

Introduction: Execution of COVID-19 lockdown measures caused variations in air pollution worldwide. This paper investigates the impact of COVID-19 stringency measures on the spatio-temporal dynamics of air pollution in Mumbai, India, using a comprehensive two-and-a-half-year pandemic period dataset. Materials and methods: We classified the pandemic period into 7 phases and 21 sub-phases based on the severity of the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) Stringency Index (SI). Optimized Hotspot analysis (OHS) and Ordinary Least Square Regression models explored the spatio-temporal fluctuations and the effect of stringency measures on air quality. Results: The R2 value varied; with the best model R2 of 0.61 for Particulate Matters (PM10) and Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and lowest of 0.23 for Sulfur dioxide (SO2). A 10-point increase in SI caused a 3-7% reduction in air pollutants. Substantial reduction in average PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and Carbon monoxide (CO) was observed throughout the COVID-19 phases. Meteorology and SI collectively caused maximum reduction of 82.6%, 72.7%, 53.8%, 52.2%, 49.1%, 28.4% for NO2, PM2.5, PM10, NH3, CO, and SO2 respectively, during complete or extreme lockdown phases. Except SO2, seasonality significantly influenced the pollutant concentrations. Winter was the worst period while monsoon was the best. OHS identified central Mumbai wards as hotspots and areas close to the national park as coldspots. Conclusion: PM10, NO2 and CO were more affected by SI measures than NH3 and SO2. For a rapid emergency response to high PM10, implementation of SI, very high (≥ 80 score) and above is advised. Findings of this study have significant public health policy implications, especially among global south nations.

The presence of solvents can significantly alter the reaction kinetics of catalytic conversions, yet the mechanisms of the solvent effect remain widely debated and could greatly vary between different chemistries. We use vapor phase Hofmann elimination of tert-butylamine (TBA) to systematically investigate how solvents participate catalyzed reaction over Brønsted acid sites of solid acid catalysts and affect a catalytic cycle. Twenty commonly used organic and inorganic solvents were tested to investigate the relationship between solvent identity and their influence on reaction kinetics. Kinetic measurements showed a significant and reversible inhibition in rates of Hofmann elimination in the presence of every tested solvent, with the degrees of reduction vary from less than 10% for non-polar solvents (carbon dioxide, benzene, hexane) to more than 90 % (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, acetonitrile), which was found to exhibit a roughly linear against the molecular dipole moment of solvents. Additionally, the degree of reduction is not affected by the size of molecule as the carbon chain length increases, but is negatively related to the degree of substitution by alkyl group on the α-carbon as well as halogen atom on the β-carbon. Despite the significant kinetic inhibition and a 30 kJ mol-1 increase in the measured apparent activation energies, the temperature programmed surface reaction profiles performed with pre-adsorbed TBA with feeding of acetonitrile and methanol showed no change in the peak temperature from the catalyst without solvent feed. Cooperative adsorption complex formed between the surface tert-butylammonium and solvent molecule adsorbed on a neighboring framework oxygen, which is far less reactive towards Hofmann elimination, is proposed to be responsible for the observed rate inhibition. Also, the stability of adsorption complex formation is found to be affected by the proton affinity of solvent, as revealed by the kinetic modeling of experimental rate measurements.

Large volumes of waste are generated from the manufacture of slabs, roofing, and tiles using slate stone. The use of waste in the construction industry is prevalent due to the environmental advantages associated with the implementation of circular economy standards. This paper examines the production of Portland cement CEM II using heat-treated slate waste. The fineness index results were 10.95% for the 75-μm sieve and 23.53% for the 45-μm sieve. Assessment of reactivity using mechanical methods showed that mortars produced with 20% slate waste (SW) achieved a strength of 42.35MPa and a mechanical index of 84.93%. Direct measurements (FTIR), along with chemical methods (Frattini Test and Saturated lime test), confirm the pozzolanic activity of the slate waste. The environmental impact assessment demonstrated a reduction in the carbon dioxide emission rate by 21.49% (6.54E+02 kgCO2-eq/t) with the use of Portland cement CEM II/CSW. The valorization of slate waste can contribute to the availability of an alternative source of raw material and the reduction of natural resource consumption. However, further studies on mechanical performance and durability are necessary for this waste to be applied in structural cementitious matrices.

Syngas produced from biomass fuels is studied for renewable energy in combustion engines. Syngas used in dual fuel modes can reduce diesel consumption in diesel engines, but exhaust products are increased. Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) can increase fuel efficiency and decrease exhaust emissions. Therefore, the research aims to study the performance and emission of a diesel-engine generator at 3,000 rpm and various loads, fueled with dual fuel modes by adding syngas, air, and EGR. Syngas was generated from wood pellet by a downdraft gasifier. Flow rates of syngas and air were added at 93 lpm and 86 lpm, respectively. EGR was expanded from 0.36 to 1.92 lpm. The best engine performance in dual fuel modes was found at 3.82 kW. The increase of syngas, air, and EGR flow rates led to the changes of engine performance and exhaust products. Regular diesel combined with syngas-air-EGR blend by increasing syngas, air, and EGR at 93 lpm, 86 lpm, and 0.84 lpm led to the addition of engine performance and the reduction of exhaust emissions. Outstandingly, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitric oxides, and particulate matter were decreased by 2.98%, 10.08%, 12.64%, and 2.60%, respectively. The regular diesel saving was raised by 43.33% compared with the mode of only regular diesel.

Against the backdrop of global climate change and the "dual carbon" target, cities have a significant responsibility to achieve carbon reduction targets. As a crucial urban agglomeration in northern China, effectively balancing economic growth with CO2 emission reduction to achieve high-quality economic development remains a significant challenge that the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region should address both presently and in the future. The objective of this study is to utilize nighttime lighting data and energy consumption information to quantify the CO2 emissions of diverse cities within the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region spanning from 2006 to 2020. The research aims to analyze the spatial progression patterns of CO2 emissions across these urban centers, identify key determinants and their interrelations, and delve into the underlying mechanisms pivotal for advancing carbon mitigation strategies within urban agglomerations. The results indicate that: with an exception in Beijing where CO2 emissions slightly decreased compared to 2006, CO2 emissions increased across cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region by 2020. High-value CO2 emission areas are primarily concentrated in central of the study area, exhibiting negative spatial correlation characteristics. Based on its urban development positioning, it is imperative for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration to formulate and implement carbon reduction strategies on innovative development, industrial upgrading, and ecological protection among other aspects towards coordinated low-carbon development.

Methane is a short-lived greenhouse gas but has a far greater warming effect than carbon dioxide. At the same time, the livestock sector serves as a large contributor to global emissions of anthropogenic methane. Herein, this work aimed to use cultivated seaweed supplementation to reduce methane emissions and investigate the potential influencing mechanism. To evaluate the feasibility, two cultivated seaweeds, Laminaria japonica Aresch, and Porphyra tenera, along with the enzymatic hydrolysates derived from L. japonica, underwent in vitro trials, and they were both added into corn silage feed (CSF) with different concentrations (1%, 5%, and 10% of CSF) for methane reduction evaluation. The results indicated that >75% and 50% reductions in methane production were observed for the seaweeds and seaweed enzymatic hydrolysates in 9- and 30-day, respectively. Combined high-throughput sequencing and multivariate analysis revealed that supplementation with seaweed and seaweed enzymatic hydrolysates had a notable impact on the prokaryotic community structure. Mantel tests further revealed that significant correlations between the prokaryotic community and methane accumulation (P < 0.05), implying the prokaryotic community plays a role in reducing methane emissions within the rumen. Correspondingly, the networks within the prokaryotic community unveiled the crucial role of propionate/butyrate-producing bacteria in regulating methane emissions through microbial interactions. The predicted function of the prokaryotic community exhibited a significant reduction in the presence of the narB gene in seaweed-supplemented treatments. This reduction may facilitate an increased rate of electron flow toward the nitrate reduction pathway while decreasing the conversion of H2 to methane. These results indicated the supplementation of cultivated seaweeds and the enzymatic hydrolysates has the potential to reshape the community structure of rumen microbial communities, and this alteration appears to be a key factor contributing to their methane production-reduction capability.

Abstract The carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) for the synthesis of high‐energy‐density and high‐value multi‐carbon (C 2+ ) products has demonstrated considerable potential for practical applications. In this work, we design a novel copper oxide foam (OD‐Cu foam) catalyst through a high‐temperature calcination process, characterized by a substantial specific surface area. The distinctive three‐dimensional structure of the OD‐Cu foam catalyst and the metal oxide particles covered on its surface provide abundant active sites. The total Faradaic efficiency of 57.3% for C 2+ products over the OD‐Cu foam is achieved at −0.85 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Furthermore, the partial current density for C 2+ products over the OD‐Cu foam reaches 44.1 mA cm −2 at −0.95 V versus RHE, surpassing significantly that both of Cu foam (3.4 mA cm −2 ) and copper oxide foil (OD‐Cu foil) (1.6 mA cm −2 ). In addition, the integrated structure of the OD‐Cu foam, which does not require complex preparation processes, facilitates its application in CO 2 RR. These results underscore the significance of three‐dimensional structure and high specific surface area, emphasizing the considerable potential of this catalyst for effective and sustainable CO 2 conversion.

Ridesplitting has the potential to enhance transportation efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions from ridesourcing services by matching multiple shared rides to the same trip. However, an inappropriate matching can significantly diminish the environmental performance of ridesplitting. This study aims to propose a shared ride matching approach to low-carbon and electrified ridesplitting. Firstly, feasible ridesplitting trips within time constraints are identified and represented using a shareability network. Subsequently, the CO2 emission reduction of each feasible ridesplitting trip is calculated by comparing it with its corresponding single ride alternative. To maximize the total CO2 emission reduction from ridesplitting trips, an optimization model for shared ride matching is established and solved using a graph-theoretic algorithm. Additionally, a priority assignment policy is designed to preferentially assign available electric vehicles to feasible ridesplitting trips that have greater potential for emission reductions. Comparative experiments conducted in Chengdu, China show that the proposed model can achieve higher levels of CO2 emission reduction without compromising service quality in ridesplitting operations. Furthermore, significant improvements in emission reductions can be achieved by implementing the priority assignment policy instead of a random assignment policy for electrified ridesplitting trips, particularly when electric vehicles are limited. Finally, the effects of maximum tolerable delay and electric vehicle penetration are further analyzed to provide valuable insights for government authorities and ridesourcing companies aiming to enhance both the economic and environmental benefits associated with ridesplitting.

The bioelectroreduction of CO2 to value-added chemical commodities, by bioeletrochemical system (BES), represents a promising approach for alleviating both energy crisis and global warming. Although a wide variety of studies have been undertaken to improve efficiency of CO2 bioelectroconversion and speculate electron pathways of electroactive microorganisms, the underlying mechanisms of CO2 bioelectroconversion are still not fully understood. A much more comprehensive understanding of electron utilization mechanisms would be helpful to the practical applications of bioelectrosynthesis. Here, the working principles in bio-electrochemical CO2 reduction were summarized, and the change of Gibbs free energy (ΔG) and dynamics for CO2 bioelectroconversion were analyzed to evaluate the potential effects of external microenvironment changes (e.g., operational conditions, supply of mediators/conductive materials, electro-activity of key functional microbes, arious redox potentials of cellular redox compounds, etc.) ono CO2 bioelectroconversion and the electron transfer chains of bioelectrocatalysis. The potential electron transfer mechanisms for CO2 bioelectroconversion to multi-carbon commodities were further summarized. Particularly, the functional proteins and genes associated with the metabolic pathway of CO2 electroreduction were discussed. Finally, taking the CO2-reducing pathways of methanogenic archaea as an example, the electron transfer pathways were illustrated in details, and the future perspectives for the possible improvement and research interests in bioelectrosynthesis of CO2 capture and use were elaborated. This paper reviews the thermodynamics and electron transfer mechanisms of CO2 bioelectroconversion, and provided the guidance for the practical implementations of employing and electrochemically manipulating electroactive functional microorganisms to electrocatalyze CO2 to value-added low-carbon commodities.

Abstract CO2-hydrate formation in porous media diminishes injectivity, which is crucial for sustained high-rate CO2 injection in geological sequestration, posing risks throughout the value chain. Confined water in small pores induces a shift in the CO2-hydrate envelope, especially in high-porosity, low-permeability chalk structures. This study aims to establish a CO2-hydrate envelope in chalk and explore the impact of brine salinity and other gases on hydrate formation. Experiments are conducted using a well-designed coreflooding rig, where a core sample is mounted with separate brine and CO2 inlet lines to minimize hydrate formation outside the porous media. Precise temperature monitoring and simultaneous injection of CO2 and water guarantee both phases' presence, with temperature reduction leading to CO2-hydrate formation. CO2-hydrate formation is tracked through pressure difference and electrical resistivity responses within the core. Preliminary findings demonstrate the repeatability and reproducibility of results, with observed heat release during hydrate initiation and subsequent temperature increase. Significant differential pressure increase indicates injectivity loss during CO2-hydrate formation, mitigated by elevated temperature, restoring core permeability. Temperature-dependent variations in hydrate formation and dissipation are noted, with ongoing experiments exploring the impact of brine salinity and non-CO2 gases on the hydrate envelope. Restricting water into small pores alters the CO2-hydrate envelope's stability, particularly in high-porosity, low-permeability chalk structures, warranting careful consideration due to limited experimental data available in the literature.

Abstract The high consumption of fossil fuels and concomitant contamination of the environment have promoted the search for new, low‐cost, and cleaner energy sources to satisfy the current energy demand around the world, decreasing the levels of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. One of the promising strategies to facilitate the generation of renewable energy involves solar‐driven chemical reactions, by using photocatalysts with improved sunlight absorption and carrier transfer abilities. Lead‐free halide perovskites (LFHPs) are good candidates, showing mesmerizing optical features, modulable band structure, oxidizing/reducing capability, and less toxicity compared to their Pb‐analogous. However, the literature reporting the photo(electro)chemical (PEC) properties of the LFHPs‐based materials for solar energy production is scarce. This review describes the current state‐of‐the‐art exhibiting the influence of the dimensionality, chemical composition and the formation of heterojunctions based on LFHPs on their photo(electro)activity for conducting solar‐driven hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction, and the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants to obtain added‐value chemicals. In this way, it is also included the main challenges to be faced. Furthermore, we address some potential LFHPs to be explored in PEC systems, opening up the gamut of possibilities to consolidate the solar‐to‐chemical transformation as an innovative alternative to favor environmentally friendly energy production.

Recently, CO2 emissions have increased, and energy generation accounts for 42.5% of worldwide CO2 emissions, making it a serious problem owing to global warming and environmental change. To address this, power-generating units are increasingly aiming to reduce emissions while minimizing costs. The primary goal of this research is to develop a complete UC method that not only optimizes the operation of an 11-generator thermal power plant but also contributes to the reduction of CO2 emissions. In this paper, a weighted sum method was used to combine multiple objectives into a single objective through weighted combinations. An efficient hybrid algorithm to support unit commitment (UC) decisions is introduced in this context. The model addresses the significance of CO2 emissions, recognizing the need to reduce the environmental impact of power generation. Finally, the study emphasizes decision-making processes that support thermal power plant operations with integrated PV systems.

Closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle by means of the sustainable electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) toward formate (FA) is a promising strategy for CO2 abatement, clearing the path toward a carbon neutral future. Currently, three possible reaction pathways have been identified for the eCO2R toward FA, all of which are initiated by the adsorption of CO2 on the electrocatalyst's surface. Therefore, a possible strategy to enhance the availability of CO2 near the active sites is to combine an active electrocatalyst material (here, SnO2) with a known carbon capture medium (here, nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (N-OMC)). SnO2 was introduced in situ during the N-OMC synthesis, yielding SnO2-N-OMCs. We approached the state of the art for Sn-based N-doped carbon electrocatalysts in terms of performance under industrially relevant currents with an average FEFA of 59% for SnO2-N-OMC (6) and 61% for SnO2-N-OMC (2). Moreover, the SnO2-N-OMC electrocatalysts require a low overpotential, courtesy of the N-OMC support, compared to the state of the art, for the selective conversion of CO2 toward FA at the industrially relevant current density of 100 mA cm–2. Additionally, the 24 h stability of the best performing SnO2-N-OMC electrocatalysts is explored, and pulverization/agglomeration and in situ SnO2 reduction are identified as major degradation pathways, allowing future research to be steered more accurately toward more stable Sn-based electrocatalysts for the eCO2R toward FA. An optimal combination of both the SnO2 species and the N-OMC carbon capture medium could result in a synergistic effect, especially when utilization of the N-OMC support material is optimized to morphologically stabilize the SnO2 active species.

Vegetables are the high valued crops for human kind as it is rich source of important vitamins and minerals especially, micronutrients and phytochemicals promote good health which helps in reduction of mal nutrition. It is also primarily responsible for the positive health effects due to contains generous amount of numerous antioxidant substances, carotenoids and phenolics. Farmers are favored for their economics due to the short period of cultivation. But due to world's biggest threat that is climate change, which has made vegetable cultivation vulnerable to extreme weather occurrences including high temperatures, unpredictable rainfall that causes flooding, and drought situations. Vegetables are very perishable in nature due to high water content i. e., 90%. Therefore, high temperature makes the cell damage and vulnerable for carry out all physiological and biological process inside the cell. Shedding down of flower bud and small fruit of solanaceous, cucurbitaceous and other types of vegetables also occur under high temperature stress. Not only drought, high temperature causes the cell damage but also erratic rainfall pattern results flood condition also dangerous for crop growth and development. In flooded condition, tomato plants produced ethylene hormone which is detrimental for fruit quality due to absence of oxygen. Increases in carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, and other harmful gases as a result of human activity are the primary cause of climate change. The majority of carbon dioxide is produced by burning of fossil fuels with emission of harmful industrial gases, methane is produced by raising livestock, and nitrous oxide is produced by using inorganic fertilizer. According to FAO, worlds vegetable production is get lowered around 18.68% due to adverse climatic effect. As a result, by 2050, an estimated 175 million more people could have zinc deficiency and 122 million more could have protein deficiency. People in poverty, who rely primarily on plant sources for sustenance, will be most affected by these effects. Therefore, to mitigate climate change problem crop prototype or idiotype will be helpful in a 328significant manner. Climate change is not only responsible for abiotic stresses but also it is responsible for spreading of biotic stress. So, incorporation of new crop prototype or new cultivar in a farming system which are resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses along with rich in high nutrition content. Climate change is not only a potential for the future; it is a reality that we are all already experiencing. Therefore, in modern farming systems modified and new innovation technology regarding water, soil and food security can be helpful to cope up in the climate change issue.

Analyzing building loads and energy-efficient retrofits is crucial for effective energy management and sustainable development. Strengthening the identification and analysis of factors that impact energy consumption is informative for devising appropriate measures. In order to address the current limitations in analyzing building energy consumption, the present study proposes a combination of the arc elasticity analysis method with CO2 storage technology. By introducing sensitivity and arc mean elasticity indices, the cooling and heating loads of building energy consumption can be analyzed. Subsequently, a CO2 refrigeration system and compression process can be designed to optimize the storage of CO2 and facilitate its role in energy conservation and reduction of energy consumption. Thus, the research aims to fulfill the potential of CO2 in promoting energy efficiency and reducing consumption. The study utilized software simulation and experimental analysis to examine the impact of the proposed method. The findings revealed a positive correlation between the heat transfer coefficient and the building's annual heat load. In addition, the maximum data variation of the building's cold load was a mere 0.05 per cent, and the relative discrepancy between the software simulation and the actual load values was less than 10 per cent. The exterior building's total cold load value showed a difference of more than 25 per cent when cooled with CO2 intervention compared to the non-intervention result. Furthermore, the building's maximum load reduction reached 3.4 per cent when uniformly varying the thickness of the insulation layer from 40 mm to 100 mm. The proposed method demonstrates a positive impact on building energy sensitivity analysis. Its energy loss design for various parts of the building could offer useful references for practical engineering designs.

Cementing is one of the most crucial operations in an oil well since it fixes the casing and prevents fluid migration across permeable zones. However, the material used in this process, Class G cement, faces exposure to various agents during and after its curing process, particularly at greater depths where temperatures and pressures are elevated. Exposure of this cement to elements like brine, H2S gas, and CO2 gas tends to compromise the material's durability and the well's integrity. Consequently, exposure to these agents leads to modifications in the cement paste's physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. Thus, investigations into the influence of these agents are crucial to ensure the integrity of the cement sheath. In this study, Class G cement pastes were exposed for three months in an autoclave under elevated pressure (20 MPa) and temperature (88 °C) in a brine-saturated environment with either H2S or CO2 at different stages. The research investigated mechanical behavior through uniaxial and triaxial compression tests, physical properties through porosity and micro-computerized tomography tests, and chemical properties through X-ray diffraction and pH tests. The study demonstrates that confining pressure significantly affects the deformation of samples exposed to brine+H2S and brine+CO2, causing plastic deformations at confining pressures above 20 MPa even before applying deviatoric stresses. Exposure to acidic gases also leads to a 27% reduction in compressive strength for brine+H2S and a 45% reduction for brine+CO2, affecting the elastic moduli due to potential micro-defects originating from the curing process and chemical reactions induced by the presence of the acidic gases.

The present study comprehensively evaluates the CO2 capture performance of morpholine (MOR) at concentrations of 2 M, 5 M, and 7 M, comparing its effectiveness against conventional amines, monoethanolamine (MEA) and 2-(methylamino)ethanol (MAE). The assessment criteria include CO2 absorption rate, desorption rate, cyclic capacity, regeneration energy consumption, and relative economic cost. Utilizing 13C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technology, we analyzed the ion concentration variations of the amine solvents under different CO2 loadings, revealing the reaction mechanisms of MOR with CO2. Our results demonstrate that MOR outperforms MEA and MAE in CO2 capture performance, particularly excelling in desorption efficiency. At a concentration of 7 M, MOR exhibited a 357.86 % increase in average desorption rate and a 46 % larger cyclic capacity compared to MEA. Additionally, MOR showed a 33.33 % reduction in regeneration energy consumption and a 7.89 % decrease in relative economic cost. The comprehensive evaluation method developed in this study indicates that MOR, with its high thermal stability and low corrosivity, maintains excellent CO2 capture performance at high amine concentrations, suggesting it as a promising absorbent for industrial applications. The findings contribute to the optimization of amine-based CO2 capture technologies and provide a robust framework for the selection and assessment of amine solvents, paving the way for more sustainable and cost-effective carbon capture solutions.

Abstract Incorporating reprocessing, recycling, and sustainable processes and materials is essential for a circular economy. Reprocessing and recycling are related since both help minimize wastage and produce a sustainable regenerative economy. However, polymers might undergo degradation depending on the recycling process, reducing their lifespan. In this study, polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) undergoes repetitive reprocessing under varied temperatures, times, and shear rates to investigate the evolution of mechanical, chemical, and thermal properties. Furthermore, foaming experiments are conducted using supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2 ) on reprocessed samples to examine changes in the properties and morphology of the foam. The significance of reprocessing PBAT is divided into environmental, temperature, and processing effects. Environmental conditions impact the results where no oxidation effects are noticed in the 2‐hour test, while 7 days of humidity exposure lead to a tenfold reduction in polymer viscosity. Different processing techniques reduce the molecular weight of PBAT and alter its polydispersity. Specifically, the number average molecular weight ( M n ) decreases from an initial 53 to 37 kDa after processes like extrusion or mixing. However, elongation at break and ultimate strength of PBAT remain unchanged after high‐shear extrusion processing. Additionally, PBAT foam morphology evolves over 5 cycles, leading to smaller pores and reducing compressive modulus.

One carbon neutralization measure applied in the concrete sector is the use of artificial carbonate in concrete for immobilization. This CO2 reduction technology corresponds to the CO2 emitted during concrete production. When considering the marketability of these technologies, especially for newly developed products in the carbon market, it is essential to quantify the amount of CO2 fixed as inorganic carbonate. Additionally, as a representative test specimen for concrete containing aggregate, a φ100 × 200 mm cylinder specimen is conventionally used for physical property evaluation. To evaluate the amount of CO2 fixed in one batch of concrete, a mass far from that of the conventional chemical analysis sample may need to be analyzed. Therefore, in this study, we investigated a pulverization process for concrete analytical materials. We also propose a new analytical apparatus that can be used to measure large cylinder specimens. Experimental results showed that the newly developed analyzer, equipped with a mass balance and CO2 and H2O gas analyzer for large cylinders, exhibited excellent analytical variability and measurement speed performance. It was also inferred that the homogenization process is necessary to grind the entire cylindrical concrete specimen into a fine powder and homogenize it to improve the representativeness of the concrete.

Human skin-derived ECM aids cell functions but can trigger immune reactions; therefore it is addressed through decellularization. Acellular dermal matrices (ADMs), known for their regenerative properties, are used in tissue and organ regeneration. ADMs now play a key role in plastic and reconstructive surgery, enhancing aesthetics and reducing capsular contracture risk. Innovative decellularization with supercritical carbon dioxide preserves ECM quality for clinical use. The study investigated the cytotoxicity, biocompatibility, and anti-inflammatory properties of supercritical CO 2 acellular dermal matrix (scADM) in vivo based on Sprague Dawley rat models. Initial experiments in vitro with fibroblast cells confirmed the non-toxic nature of scADM and demonstrated cell infiltration into scADMs after incubation. Subsequent tests in vitro revealed the ability of scADM to suppress inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) presenting by the reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and MCP-1. In the in vivo model, histological assessment of implanted scADMs in 6 months revealed a decrease in inflammatory cells, confirmed further by the biomarkers of inflammation in immunofluorescence staining. Besides, an increase in fibroblast infiltration and collagen formation was observed in histological staining, which was supported by various biomarkers of fibroblasts. Moreover, the study demonstrated vascularization and macrophage polarization, depicting increased endothelial cell formation. Alteration of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) was analyzed by RT-PCR, indicating the reduction of MMP2, MMP3, and MMP9 levels over time. Simultaneously, an increase in collagen deposition of collagen I and collagen III was observed, verified in immunofluorescent staining, RT-PCR, and western blotting. Overall, the findings suggested that scADMs offer significant benefits in improving outcomes in implant-based procedures as well as soft tissue substitution.

Background United States (U.S.) school meal programs serve billions of meals annually; however, little is known about their environmental impacts.Objective This study estimated the daily greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), water scarcity footprint (WSF), and food cost associated with the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and School Breakfast Program (SBP) Programs and modeled the association of food substitutions and food waste reduction.Design A cross-sectional analysis of day-1 dietary intake in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2011-2018.Participants/Setting Participants included 796 children and adolescents from pre-Kindergarten to grade 12 who consumed breakfast or lunch on a weekday from a school cafeteria that met the minimum standard for an eligible meal. Main outcome measures The main outcomes were per capita nutrient intake, GHGE, WSF, and food cost.Statistical analyses performed Differences in mean impacts and between baseline and two modeled scenarios (food substitutions, food waste reductions) were evaluated using paired Wald tests.Results Daily per capita GHGE, WSF, and food cost for school food programs (NSLP + SBP) was 1.69 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) (95% CI: 1.55-1.84 kg CO2eq), 10.23 L eq×102 (9.20-11.27 L eq×102), and USD $3.70 ($3.39-4.00), respectively. Dairy (mainly cow’s milk) and protein foods (mainly beef) were the largest contributors to GHGE. Fruit was the largest contributor to the WSF. Modeled food substitutions significantly reduced GHGE by 14-25% and WSF by 11-14% for the school meal programs. There were mixed effects on food cost (-2% to 6% change) and nutrient intake. Modeled food waste reductions of 5% were associated with a 1% decrease in GHGE, WSF, and food costs.Conclusions The NSLP and SBP are critical to child nutrition, and food substitution and food waste reduction strategies can lower their environmental footprint with manageable impacts on nutrition quality.

To learn more about the behavior of amine (NH2)-functionalized metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived noble metal catalysts in the removal of aromatic volatile organic compounds in air, benzene oxidation at low temperatures has been investigated using 0.2-, 0.8-, and 1.5%-platinum (Pt)/Universitetet i Oslo (UiO)-66-NH2. The benzene conversion (XB) of x%-Pt/UiO-66-NH2-R under dry conditions (175 °C) was 23% (x = 0.2%) < 52% (x = 0.8%) < 100% (x = 1.5%): 'R' suffix denotes reduction pretreatment using a hydrogen (10 vol %) and nitrogen mixture at 300 °C for the generation of metallic Pt (Pt0) sites and simultaneous partial MOF decomposition into carbon- and nitrogen-loaded zirconium dioxide. The prominent role of reduction pretreatment was apparent in benzene oxidation as 1.5%-Pt/UiO-66-NH2 did not exhibit catalytic activity below 175 °C (dry condition). The promotional role of moisture in benzene oxidation by 1.5%-Pt/UiO-66-NH2-R was evident with a rise in the steady-state reaction rate (r) at 110 °C (21 kPa molecular oxygen (O2)) from 1.3 × 10–3 to 5.0 × 10–3 μmol g–1 s–1 as the water (H2O) partial pressure increased from 0 to 1.88 kPa. In contrast, the activity was lowered with increasing RH due to catalyst poisoning by excess moisture (r (110 °C) of 6.6 × 10–04 μmol g–1 s–1 at 2.83 kPa H2O (21 kPa O2)). Kinetic modeling suggests that XB proceeds through the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism on the Pt/UiO-66-NH2-R surface (dissociative O2 chemisorption and the involvement of two oxygen species in benzene oxidation). According to the density functional theory simulation, the carbon and nitrogen impurities are to make the first XB step (i.e., hydrogen migration from the benzene molecule to the substrate) energetically favorable. The second hydrogen atom from the benzene molecule is also extracted effectively, while the oxygen derived from O2 facilitates further XB. The Pt0 sites dissociate the O2 and H2O molecules, while the product of the latter, i.e., free hydrogen and hydroxyl, makes the subsequent XB steps energetically favorable.

Through photosynthesis, forests absorb annually large amounts of atmospheric CO2. However, they also release CO2 back through respiration. These two, opposite in sign, large fluxes determine how much of the carbon is stored or released back into the atmosphere. The mean seasonal cycle (MSC) is an interesting metric that associates phenology and carbon (C) partitioning/allocation analysis within forest stands. Here, we applied the 3D-CMCC-FEM model and analyzed its capability to represent the main C-fluxes, by validating the model against observed data, questioning if the sink/source mean seasonality is influenced under two scenarios of climate change, in five contrasting European forest sites. We found the model has, under current climate conditions, robust predictive abilities in estimating NEE. Model results also predict a consistent reduction in the forest’s capabilities to act as a C-sink under climate change and stand-aging at all sites. Such a reduction is predicted despite the number of annual days as a C-sink in evergreen forests increasing over the years, indicating a consistent downward trend. Similarly, deciduous forests, despite maintaining a relatively stable number of C-sink days throughout the year and over the century, show a reduction in their overall annual C-sink capacity. Overall, both types of forests at all sites show a consistent reduction in their future mitigating potential.

Abstract Using CO2 as a heat extraction medium from the subsurface offers several compelling advantages. These benefits result from CO2's distinct properties, notably its lower viscosity compared to water, as well as its pronounced density variations under varying pressures. Using CO2, it becomes possible to harness higher flow rates and density fluctuations to create a thermosyphon effect. These effects result in significant cost savings when contrasted with conventional water-based geothermal projects. To effectively predict and optimize the utilization of CO2 in geothermal applications, a precise understanding of CO2 properties and CO2-hydrocarbon gas-water mixtures become imperative. We conducted a series of highly accurate composition, viscosity and density measurements of CO2-methane-water mixtures. To prepare the mixtures, CO2 and CO2-methane gas was humidified in a saturating unit with accurate control of pressure and temperature. The humid gas was then directed through a capillary rheometer and an oscillating U-tube to measure viscosity and density of the mixtures. The outlet was equipped with a multi-stage gravimetric hygrometer to measure the water content and get the composition of the mixture. To ensure reproducibility and high quality of the data, the experiments were conducted repeatedly. Our research yielded data across a spectrum of CO2-methane-water properties. The measured water solubility in CO2 agreed with existing literature, while significantly extending the available dataset into the realm of high pressure and temperature conditions, pertinent to CO2 geothermal applications. This extension elucidated the non-linear relationship between solubility and pressure. Brine salinity has a noticeable impact on water solubility in CO2, causing up to a 15% reduction. Our investigation also established the relationship between water solubility and the CO2 content within CO2/Methane mixtures.Furthermore, our study precisely quantified the influence of CO2's water content on phase density and viscosity, revealing that while water's effect on CO2 density is modest, it engenders a substantial difference in CO2 viscosity, with variations of up to 9.1% observed between dry and water-saturated CO2. This paper addresses critical knowledge gaps pertaining to the modelling of CO2-methane-water fluids for CO2 geothermal applications. Our laboratory findings substantially enhance the dataset for water solubility in CO2 under high-pressure, high-temperature conditions. Furthermore, we shed light on the influence of brine salinity and gas composition, aspects that have not been extensively explored previously. Additionally, we unravel the impact of these properties on the density and viscosity of CO2-rich phases, enabling accurate predictions of volumetric and flow behaviour. Furthermore, this paper presents a comprehensive account of our experimental methodology and procedures. The results obtained have been rigorously cross verified with existing literature data, affirming the robustness of our chosen approach.

Abstract This study explores a green pathway for urea synthesis using plasma-ice interaction with gas mixtures of N2 + CO2 and NH3 + CO2. Electrical and optical emission spectroscopy were employed to characterize the plasmas, revealing that urea formation involves complex reactions driven by high-energy species, producing reactive nitrogen and carbon intermediates that further react to form urea. Physicochemical analyses of plasma-treated ice showed increased pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and reduced oxidation-reduction potential (ORP). Optimization of plasma process parameters (gas pressure, applied voltage, and treatment time) was performed to enhance urea formation. Among these parameters, plasma treatment time had the most substantial influence. Increasing treatment time from 20 to 60 minutes significantly impacted physicochemical properties: for N2 + CO2 plasma, pH increased by 21.05%, EC by 184.7%, and ORP decreased by 27.48%; for NH3 + CO2 plasma, pH increased by 27.37%, EC by 239.05%, and ORP decreased by 72.67%, respectively. The study shows that NH3 + CO2 plasma produces a significantly higher concentration of urea (7.7 mg L-1) compared to N2 + CO2 plasma (0.55 mg L-1). This is attributed to the direct availability and reactivity of ammonia, which simplifies reaction pathways and enhances intermediate formation. These findings highlight the potential of plasma-ice interaction as an energy-efficient and environmentally friendly method for urea synthesis, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional processes.

The excessive emission of CO2 has aroused increasingly serious environmental problems. Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an effective way to reduce CO2 concentration and simultaneously produce highly valued chemicals and fuels. Cuδ+ species are regarded as promising active sites to obtain multi‐carbon compounds in CO2RR, however, they are easily reduced to Cu0 during the reaction and fail to retain the satisfying selectivity for C2+ products. Herein, via a one‐step method, we synthesize Cu2(OH)2CO3 microspheres composed of nanosheets, which has achieved a superior Faraday efficiency for C2+ products as high as 76.29 % at ‐1.55 V vs. RHE in an H cell and 78.07 % at ‐100 mA cm‐2 in a flow cell. Electrochemical measurements, in situ Raman spectra and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectra as well as the theoretic calculation unveil that, compared with Cu(OH)2 and CuO, the dual O‐containing anionic groups (OH‐ and CO32‐) in Cu2(OH)2CO3 can effectively stabilize the Cuδ+ species, promote the adsorption and activation of CO2, boost the coverage of *CO and the coupling of *CO‐*COH, thus sustain the flourishment of C2+ products.

Electrochemical reduction of CO2 is an important way to achieve carbon neutrality, and much effort has been devoted to the design of active sites. Apart from elevating intrinsic activity, expanding the functionality of active site may also boost catalytic performance. Here we have designed “negatively charged Ag (nc‐Ag)” active sites featuring both the intrinsic activity and the capability of regulating microenvironment, through modifying Ag nanoparticles with atomically dispersed Sn species. Different from conventional active sites (which only govern surface process by bonding with the intermediates), the nc‐Ag sites could manipulate environmental species. Therefore, the sites could not only activate CO2, but also regulate interfacial H2O and CO2, as confirmed by operando spectroscopies. The catalyst delivers a high current density with CO faradaic efficiency of 97%. Our work here opens up new opportunities for the design of multifunctional electrocatalytic active sites.

This research aims to study and develop a model to demonstrate the causal relationships of factors used to forecast CO2 emissions from energy consumption in the industrial building sector and to make predictions for the next 10 years (2024–2033). This aligns with Thailand’s goals for sustainability development, as outlined in the green economy objectives. The research employs a quantitative research approach, utilizing Linear Structural Relationships based on a Latent Growth Model (LISREL-LGM model) which is a valuable tool for efficient country management towards predefined green economy objectives by 2033. The research findings reveal continuous significant growth in the past economic sector (1990–2023), leading to subsequent growth in the social sector. Simultaneously, this growth has had a continuous detrimental impact on the environment, primarily attributed to the economic growth in the industrial building sector. Consequently, the research indicates that maintaining current policies would result in CO2 emissions from energy consumption in the industrial building sector exceeding the carrying capacity. Specifically, the growth rate (2033/2024) would increase by 28.59%, resulting in a surpassing emission of 70.73 Mt CO2 Eq. (2024–2033), exceeding the designated carrying capacity of 60.5 Mt CO2 Eq. (2024–2033). Therefore, the research proposes strategies for country management to achieve sustainability, suggesting the implementation of new scenario policies in the industrial building sector. This course of action would lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions (2024–2033) from energy consumption in the industrial building sector to 58.27 Mt CO2 Eq., demonstrating a decreasing growth rate below the carrying capacity. This underscores the efficacy and appropriateness of the LISREL-LGM model employed in this research for guiding decision making towards green economy objectives in the future.

The CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2–ODHP) is a highly important reaction for not only producing large amounts of propylene but also consuming the CO2 resource. GaN/zeolite catalysts deliver preferable activity in the reaction. However, similar to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, there are shortcomings such as poor stability and coke accumulation, especially when operated at temperatures higher than 550 °C. Generally, carbon deposition is one of the main reasons for catalyst deactivation. The limited mass transfer greatly aggravates the deposited carbon formation, since carbon precursors could not be removed in time. In the present work, we modified zeolites with a short b-axis and hierarchical pores, which could offer a shorter diffusion distance and pore-rich structure to enhance the mass transfer. Thanks to this enhancement, the catalyst offers an initial propane conversion of 68.0% with a yield of 39.4% to propylene, surpassing other reported GaN/zeolite catalysts to data. Importantly, the catalyst showed a low loss rate of activity and a low amount of deposited carbon, which was easily regenerated compared with those of other catalysts without a short b-axis or hierarchical pores. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) confirmed that the reaction involves a coupling reaction of direct dehydrogenation and CO2 reduction via reverse water–gas shift reaction, and CO2 participates in the reaction. The present work sheds light on designing an efficient catalyst for CO2–ODHP via a mass transfer-boosted strategy and, importantly, is expected to provide inspiration in constructing a zeolite with a short b-axis and hierarchical pores.

Abstract An approach that combines data-driven analysis and modeling was used to select the optimal mud motor power section tailored to specific drilling requirements. Additionally, a novel methodology was developed for estimating the CO2 footprint of drilling operations based on operational data. Practical demonstrations verified that the strategic utilization of the optimal power section enhances drilling efficiency and mitigates the CO2 impact associated with drilling processes. Our focus revolves around choosing the optimal power section for the drilling, considering both drilling conditions and limits. Additionally, we estimatethe CO2 footprint for the entire drilling process after the job to underscore the positive impact of selecting the right power section. To achieve these goals, we integrate an advanced physical model of the power section with the capabilities of machine learning and data science. This power section model empowers us to predict its performance and durability in advance, facilitating an optimal choice based on expected drilling conditions. The established workflow for CO2 footprint estimation utilizes surface drilling data, ensuring precise results. To optimize the power section for drilling, we employ a modeling method coupled with a machine-learning approach. This aids in selecting a suitable power section type and determining drilling parameters based on specific requirements and equipment specifications, contributing to heightened drilling efficiency. Leveraging digital capabilities enables strategic implementation to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. Enhancing drilling efficiency via optimal mud motor power section selection improves rate of penetration, reduces nonproductive time, and substantially cuts field failures. This cumulatively shortens total drilling time, leading to both direct and indirect CO2 emissions reductions. To gauge the carbon footprint during drilling operations, we construct a physical model. This model predicts rig power consumption by considering surface drilling parameters (as pressure, flow rate, etc.). It estimates power consumption by components like mud pumps, top drive, and draw works, using system efficiency data. Additionally, a model encompassing generator sets and diesel combustion is employed to estimate CO2 emissions. Application of the proposed methodology to a real field example demonstrated the impact of enhanced drilling performance with optimal power sections versus conventional ones, along with effective greenhouse gas emissions reduction. The entirety of the results and conclusions highlights the substantial value of digital technologies and a smart approach in selecting drilling equipment for the energy transition.

Abstract Double‐atom catalysts (DACs) with asymmetric coordination are crucial for enhancing the benefits of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction and advancing sustainable development, however, the rational design of DACs is still challenging. Herein, we synthesize atomically dispersed catalysts with novel sulfur‐bridged Cu‐S‐Ni sites (named Cu‐S‐Ni/SNC), utilizing biomass wool keratin as precursor. The plentiful disulfide bonds in wool keratin overcome the limitations of traditional gas‐phase S ligand etching process and enable the one‐step formation of S‐bridged sites. X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) confirms the existence of bimetallic sites with N 2 Cu‐S‐NiN 2 moiety. In H‐cell, Cu‐S‐Ni/SNC shows high CO Faraday efficiency of 98.1% at −0.65 V versus RHE. Benefiting from the charge tuning effect between the metal site and bridged sulfur atoms, a large current density of 550 mA cm −2 can be achieved at ‐1.00 V in flow cell. Additionally, in situ XAS, attenuated total reflection surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR‐SEIRAS), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show Cu as the main adsorption site is dual‐regulated by Ni and S atoms, which enhances CO 2 activation and accelerates the formation of *COOH intermediates. This kind of asymmetric bimetallic atom catalysts may open new pathways for precision preparation and performance regulation of atomic materials toward energy applications.

Offshore heavy oil injection gas extraction is a highly scrutinized area in today's petroleum industry. However, the interaction mechanisms between oil and gas are not clear. To elucidate these mechanisms, an indoor experimental setup was established for research purposes. The effects of different types of gases on heavy oil expansion, mass transfer mechanisms between gas and heavy oil, the influence of gas injection on heavy oil phase behavior, and the testing of minimum miscibility pressures are investigated in this study. The results indicate that CO2 yields the best reduction in the heavy oil viscosity. Both forward and backward multiple contact mass transfer processes demonstrate nonmiscible multiple contact dynamic displacement mechanisms involving CO2 dissolution and condensation, as well as C1 extraction and coextraction. Nonmiscible multiple contact dynamic displacement of natural gas primarily involves limited dissolution and condensation of light hydrocarbon components and intermediate hydrocarbon components, with an extremely weak extraction effect. The minimum miscibility pressures are in the order of CO2 < natural gas < N2. This research provides important experimental evidence and theoretical guidance for further improving offshore heavy oil injection gas technology and practice.

CO2 geological sequestration in coal seams can be carried out to achieve the dual objectives of CO2 emission reduction and enhanced coalbed methane production, making it a highly promising carbon capture and storage technology. However, the injection of CO2 into coal reservoirs in the form of supercritical fluid (ScCO2) leads to complex physicochemical reactions with the coal seam, altering the properties of the coal reservoir and impacting the effectiveness of CO2 sequestration and methane production enhancement. In this paper, theoretical calculations based on ReaxFF-MD were conducted to study the interaction mechanism between ScCO2 and the macromolecular structures of both low-rank and high-rank coal, to address the limitations of experimental methods. The reaction of ScCO2 with low-rank coal and high-rank coal exhibited significant differences. At the swelling stage, the low-rank coal experienced a decrease in aromatic structure and aliphatic structure, and high-rank coal showed an increase in aromatic structure and a decrease in aliphatic structure, while the swelling phenomenon was more pronounced in high-rank coal. At the dissolution stage, low-rank coal was initially decomposed into two secondary molecular fragments, and then these recombined to form a new molecular structure; the aromatic structure increased and the aliphatic structure decreased. In contrast, high-rank coal showed the occurrence of stretches–breakage–movement–reconnection, a reduction in aromatic structure, and an increase in aliphatic structure. The primary reasons for these variations lie in the distinct molecular structure compositions and the properties of ScCO2, leading to different reaction pathways of the functional group and aromatic structure. The reaction pathways of functional groups and aromatic structures in coal can be summarized as follows: the breakage of the O–H bond in hydroxyl groups, the breakage of the C–OH bond in carboxyl groups, the transformation of aliphatic structures into smaller hydrocarbon compounds or the formation of long-chain alkenes, and various pathways involving the breakage, rearrangement, and recombination of aromatic structures. In low-rank coal, there is a higher abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups and aliphatic structures. The breakage of O–H and C–OH chemical bonds results in the formation of free radical ions, while some aliphatic structures detach to produce hydrocarbons. Additionally, some of these aliphatic structures combine with carbonyl groups and free radical ions to generate new aromatic structures. Conversely, in high-rank coal, a lower content of oxygen-containing functional groups and aliphatic structures, along with stronger intramolecular forces, results in fewer chemical bond breakages and makes it less conducive to the formation of new aromatic structures. These results elucidate the specific deformations of different chemical groups, offering a molecular-level understanding of the interaction between CO2 and coal.

Abstract The paper aims to outline the technical challenges and opportunities associated with implementing blue hydrogen production in the Panchevo oil refinery. It will emphasize a viable pathway for decarbonization, focusing on optimizing carbon capture and storage technologies, ensuring cost-effectiveness, and addressing environmental concerns. The scope includes contributing to the refinery's sustainability goals and fostering innovation in the energy transition. The approach involves utilizing Aspen Hysys for CO2 emission calculations, assessing all refinery emitters, and defining the carbon footprint. The required CO2 reduction for European blue hydrogen standards has been determined. Physical space needs for a carbon capture unit are analyzed, with parcel allocation. Three hydrogen production scenarios are evaluated using facility data and specialized software. This comprehensive methodology ensures a thorough examination of technical challenges and opportunities in implementing blue hydrogen production at the Panchevo oil refinery, emphasizing sustainability and adherence to European standards. The study employed Aspen Hysys with a Gibbs reactor to model fuel combustion, optimizing Gibbs free energy for phase and chemical equilibrium. Adjusting air flow to measured oxygen values, it was found that HPU emissions contribute 41% to total refinery emissions. Steam Methane Reforming data revealed current hydrogen production and the plant's underutilization at 50-60% capacity, indicating room for expansion. Implementing carbon capture technology enables the monetization of premium blue hydrogen. Analysis of three scenarios, with additional daily hydrogen production of 20t/day, 35t/day, and 50t/day, consistently showed a 74% emission reduction to meet blue hydrogen standards, equating to 350,000–530,000 tCO2/year for capture and storage. The proposed solution involves transporting captured CO2 via a pipeline to a depleted gas field located 40 km from the refinery, aligning with sustainability goals.

Electrolyte cations have been demonstrated to effectively enhance the rate and selectivity of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet their implementation in electrolyte‐free membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer presents significant challenges. Herein, an anchored cation strategy that immobilizes Cs+ on carbon vacancies was designed and innovatively implemented in MEA electrolyzer, enabling highly efficient CO2 electroreduction over commercial silver catalyst. Our approach achieves a CO partial current density of approximately 500 mA cm−2 in the MEA electrolyzer, three‐fold enhancement compared to pure Ag. In‐situ Raman and theoretical analyses, combined with machine learning potentials, reveal anchored Cs induces an electric field that significantly promotes the adsorption of *CO2− intermediates through performing muti‐point energy calculations on each structure. Furthermore, reduced adsorption of *OH intermediates effectively hampers competing hydrogen evolution reaction, as clarified by disk electrode experiments and density functional theory studies. Additionally, coupling our system with commercial polysilicon solar cells yields a notable solar‐to‐CO energy conversion efficiency of 8.3%. This study opens a new avenue for developing effective cation‐promoting strategy in MEA reactors for efficient CO2RR.

Integrated renewable-based power cycles should be employed to produce more sustainable electricity. This is a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of three combined power plants, encompassing: case 1 involving combined geothermal and wind, case 2 featuring combined geothermal and solar, and case 3 integrating wind and solar systems. The base case perovskite solar cell (PSC) modelling assumes a 3-year lifespan and a power conversion efficiency of 17 %. However, diverse scenarios are evaluated through a sensitivity assessment involving enhancements in lifetime and efficiency. The base case evaluation emphasizes that the phases with the most significant negative environmental effects which includes the drilling of geothermal wells, construction of wind plants, and manufacturing and installation of PSCs. The midpoint findings indicate that boosting the power conversion efficiency of PSC from 17 % to 35 % yields a notable decrease in environmental impact. Moreover, extending the lifetime from 3 to 15 years led to reduction in CO2 emissions from 0.0373 and 0.0185 kg CO2 eq/kWh to 0.026 and 0.0079 kg CO2 eq/kWh in cases 2 and 3, respectively. Assessing worst and best-case scenarios highlights significant declines in certain impact categories. In case 3, terrestrial ecotoxicity (TE), photochemical oxidant formation (POF), human toxicity (HT), marine ecotoxicity (ME), and marine eutrophication (MU) saw reductions exceeding 88 % compared to worst-case results. The environmental effects observed in cases 2 and 3 stem from toxicity and metal depletion, mainly linked to the PSC. Endpoint results revealed that when considering a PSC lifespan of 10 years or more, the detrimental ecosystem impacts of cases 2 and 3 become less severe than those of case 1. Uncertainty assessment has been done for different cases and impact categories. The study's results are also novel in which it evaluated the innovative PSC technology when integrated with other renewable resources, contrasting it with other integrated plants.

The features of the adsorbent utilized for biogas purification are covered in this study. The aim of this study was to investigate the features of the banana stem adsorbent that may be applied to the adsorption process for the purification of biogas. The research involved the preparation of banana stem powder, the removal of lignin, the creation of adsorbents, and the purification of biogas using the adsorption technique. The adsorption contact time variations used were (30; 60; 90) minutes, with a biogas flow rate of 1 l/minute and a banana stem particle size of 20 mesh. Samples were analyzed by lignocellulosic content analysis, FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy), SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope), and Gas Chromatography. According to the research findings, the adsorbent made from banana stems that can be used to purify biogas has a cellulose content of 47.5%, in the FT-IR analysis there is a shift in the peak number of stretching in the hydroxyl and carboxylic acid functional groups and has a surface structure of banana stem fiber that is orderly. The longer the contact time in the biogas purification process utilizing banana stem adsorbent with variations in adsorption contact time acquired, the more CO2 was adsorbed and the higher the CH4 concentration in the purified biogas. The biogas purification process resulted in a 39.893% reduction in CO2 content and the best contact time to produce the largest CH4 content was 90 minutes with the resulting CH4 content of 64.786%.

Abstract According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) Net Zero report of 2023, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is projected to achieve an 8% reduction in cumulative emissions, with an estimated capacity of 6 billion tons per year by 2050. The purpose of this work is to estimate the magnitude of effort required to meet this projection, both from an economic and an energy point of view. Based on the post-combustion process of a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) power plant and using Shell-Cansolv proprietary DC-103 solvent as a reference capture agent, an analysis of the energy requirements and economic costs associated with this technology has been conducted. This analysis includes parameters such as the energy surplus required for CO2 capture, Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) and Operational Expenditure (OPEX) of the plant. Costs related to CO2 transport and storage have not been considered. The values obtained, applied to the IEA's climate neutrality goals, are essential for understanding the operational and economic challenges of post-combustion capture. In particular, considering the important role of CCS in the IEA report and considering the calculation made with the reference data, about 5000 plants would need to be built by 2050, equivalent to an average of nearly 200 plants annually. This would require an investment of $1.24 trillion according by the current available technologies. Moreover, an additional energy cost of about 25% for the CCGT plant would be required to capture the CO2 that has been emitted for the power production. This could also result in additional CO2 emissions, thereby reducing the net capture capacity of the system. These data illustrate the scale of commitment required to achieve the ambitious climate-neutrality goals, in which significant amount of economic efforts and energy resources will have to be drawn upon. It also highlights the urgency of investing in more efficient and sustainable CO2 capture technologies and strategies. This study provides quantitative data that can be useful in making informed decisions regarding the adoption and implementation of CCS technologies.

Abstract Accurately reproducing the coupling of fluid flow in porous medium and rock mechanics is crucial for the modelling of CO2 geological storage in order to properly evaluate and prevent the risk of inducing fault instability during injection operations. As an alternative to using monolithic flow/mechanical suites, the process can be modelled by linking individual codes, i.e., a reservoir simulator for flow and a geomechanical package to account for fluid induced stress change, which tackle the two problems sequentially. We developed a flexible numerical framework where different coupling logics can be selected, i.e., one-way coupling, two-way coupling, and explicit coupling, which are characterized by different levels of accuracy and computational costs. A multirate two-way coupling algorithm, which allows the flow and mechanical simulators to exchange information periodically rather than at every time step, is also available to reduce the computational cost of two-way coupled simulations. In this work, we employ this coupling infrastructure to perform numerical experiments aimed at defining whether sequential iterative coupling is strictly needed or not, and which less expensive logic can be used in case to attain a similar solution accuracy. First, a synthetic test case is used to illustrate the onset of fault instability during CO2 injection operations for different sets of coupling parameters (type and frequency), rock properties and fault permeability. It is thus possible to evaluate, for a reasonable range of coupling strength, which depends on fluids and rock properties, the optimal level of coupling. Results are strongly influenced by the coupling strength and two-way iterative coupling should be selected for tightly coupled systems to accurately reproduce the fault behavior. For loosely coupled system instead, the one-way approach should be the preferred choice due its lower computational cost. Later, we consider CO2 injection into a realistic formation, and we analyze the impact of the coupling frequency on the computational performance. We show that for complex cases there is no one-to-one correspondence between the reduction in the number of coupling iterations and the reduction in computational time for increasing coupling period.

Abstract In 2021 the European Commission has proposed the Fit-for-55 policy package, requiring European countries to reduce their CO2 emissions by 55% with respect to 1990 by the year 2030, a first step to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Energy system modelling can be a valuable tool for national policymakers to choose the most appropriate technologies to achieve these goals efficiently. This article presents a model of the Italian power system realized employing the open energy modelling framework, Oemof. A Linear Programming Optimization is implemented to evaluate how to minimize system costs at decreasing CO2 emissions in 2030. The developed tool is applied to evaluate different research questions: i) pathway towards full decarbonization and power self-sufficiency of the electricity sector in Italy, ii) relevance of flexibility assets in power grids: li-ion batteries, hydrogen storage and transmission lines reinforcement. A 55% CO2 emissions reduction for the actual Italian power sector can be achieved through an increase of 30% of the total annual system cost. Achieving complete decarbonization and self-sufficiency increases significatively annual expenditures. However, cost mitigation is plausible through the integration of sector coupling methodologies or the adoption of a broader spectrum of technological solutions. Flexibility measures appear instrumental for decarbonization, particularly transmission lines, demanding a substantial expansion beyond the stated plans for 2030. This infrastructure is crucial in Italy to facilitate the transfer of renewable electricity generated in the Southern regions to the Northern areas, where a large portion of the electricity demand is located.

Biomass, due to its neutrality in terms of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere during its life cycle, is considered an interesting renewable source for energy production as an alternative to the use of more polluting fossil fuels. Among the different wood fuels, pellets are convenient for use in dedicated stoves, and pellet heating systems have a high energy efficiency. The aim of this work was to estimate the economic and global warming potential (GWP100a) generated along the thermal energy supply chain of wood pellets, starting from the production of raw biomass from dedicated poplar cultivations and ending with the use of pellets in stoves by the end-user to produce thermal energy and ash. The Eco-Efficiency Indicator (EEI) was used to link the economic and environmental performance for eight proposed scenarios, obtained by combining different levels of mechanisation for poplar harvesting and wood biomass management before arrival at the pellet plant. For the thermal energy produced by the poplar wood pellet, the GWP100a ranged from 1.5 × 10−2 to 2.1 × 10−2 kg CO2−eq MJ−1 for three-year-old plantations and from 1.9 × 10−2 to 2.4 × 10−2 kg CO2−eq MJ−1, for six-year-old plantations. In terms of eco-efficiency of the baseline scenario (EEIb), the most favourable scenarios remain those linked to the use of biomass from three-year-old poplar plantations, with EEIb values ranging from 0.31 to 0.60 € kgCO2−eq−1, compared to from 0.29 to 0.36 € kgCO2−eq−1 for pellets obtained from biomass produced from six-year-old poplar plantations. In terms of the Global Eco-Efficiency Indicator (EEIg), which also takes into account the positive effect on the reduction of greenhouse gases due to the storage of carbon in the soil by the plantations and the reduction of emissions from avoided fossil fuels, the most favourable scenarios remain those linked to the use of biomass from three-year-old poplar plantations, with EEIg values that vary in the range of 0.60 ÷ 1.04 € kgCO2−eq−1, compared to 0.55 ÷ 0.62 € kg CO2−eq−1 for thermal energy obtained using biomass from six-year-old poplar plantations.

Abstract This report discusses experienced lower C2 / C2+ recovery in NGL recovery unit of Saudi Aramco Khursaniyah Gas Plant Department (KGPD). The experienced lower recoveries were due to the unplanned outage of HP gas and no available HP gas feed to NGL plant. This led to uneven flow distribution of the gas through splits and turbo expander side which ultimately led to lower utilization of critical heat integrations affecting the temperature profile of the demethanizer column and eventually led to a lower C2 recovery overall. However, KGP has evaluated and applied an initiative solution of recycling over 100 MMSCFD of sweet gas back to the NGL train through the start-up line. The innovative solution boosted the C2 recovery to 95% from 84%. This special mode of operation of recycling sweet gas held for 8 days and after preforming the enhancement it was observed that NGL production was increased by 6.5 MBD with a total quantity of 52,000 BBL. Moreover, fuel gas quality improved as a result of lower C2+ components resulted in CO2 avoidance by 52% which represents a reduction of to 70 KTons of CO2.

Abstract The global challenge of climate change has prompted significant steps to reduce CO2 emissions, guided by international agreements like the Paris Agreement, which set targets for the transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources. Acting too slowly could result in future losses and reputational issues, while moving too swiftly could jeopardize shareholder value due to the marginal profitability or potential losses resulting from technology challenges and the immaturity of many renewable projects. To navigate this complex landscape wisely, energy companies will benefit from developing Sequential Decision Making (SDM) policies to maximize value creation from decision flexibility under uncertainties. However, achieving this goal is not trivial. This necessitates the use of decision-analysis and optimization methods that deliver robust decision insights without prohibitive computational costs or delays. In this research, we propose a multi-objective SDM framework to model the dynamic energy landscape up to 2050, allowing exploration of various decision strategies related to different portfolios for allocating funds across three sectors: hydrocarbon, renewables, and CO2 reduction investments. This approach aims to maximize value during the transformation while accounting for uncertainties in hydrocarbon and renewable energy productions, energy prices, and production costs. The framework targets three main objectives: maximizing profit, minimizing CO2 emission, and enhancing competitive advantage. Our research evaluates the benefits of using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to solve for the optimal investment decision policy for the SDM context. The sequential decisions of the energy company shape the virtual dynamic environment by influencing various variables. Subsequently, the environment responds with new variable states and immediate value feedback, reflecting the three defined objectives. Through repeated interactions, the RL algorithm navigates the extensive state space, learning the optimal decision policy amidst uncertainties.

Abstract The rate and severity of potential loss of CO2 injectivity in saline aquifers due to brine dry-out and salt accumulation near-wellbore is one of the main uncertainties in CCS project planning. Default parameters implemented in commercial reservoir simulators overestimate the degree of salt precipitation and resulting permeability impairment. The current study used lab and digital core analyses of Berea sandstone to estimate the petrophysical and dynamic properties for adjustment of predicted precipitation and flow reduction in reservoir simulation models of intermittent CO2 injection with aquifer drive. A set of 23 core plugs were subjected to repeated brine infiltration and drying for varying cycles and drying methods, and characterized by dried-state measurements of helium porosity, Klinkenberg permeability and mercury intrusion capillary pressure, plus non-destructive 3D X-ray imaging. In early cycles, permeability showed a gradual linear decrease with porosity loss, followed by a much steeper decline over later cycles, due to preferential accumulation of salt near the end faces. The plug-scale 3D porosity map was used to history match the flow experiments, to remove these end-effects from the salt-blocking porosity-permeability trend and generalized Kozeny-Carman exponent. High-resolution 3D imaging of a Berea subsample through an analogous sequence of small-scale brine infiltration-drying experiments was used to visualize the precipitated salt in pores, for pore-scale simulation of the porosity-permeability trend in the absence of larger-scale heterogeneities in salt distribution. Further, the co-flow of brine and CO2 during drainage and imbibition was also simulated in this salt-blocked image sequence, to generate curves of relative permeability and capillary pressure versus saturation of brine and dried salt. The resulting flow properties at pore- to plug-scale were integrated into a conceptual reservoir model to evaluate injectivity impairment caused by salt clogging.

In the present investigation, Cu2O-based composites were successfully prepared through a multistep method where cubic Cu2O nanoparticles (CU Cu2O) have been grown on Reduced Graphene Oxide (RGO) nanosheets. The structural and morphological properties of the materials have been studied through a comprehensive characterization, confirming the coexistence of crystalline Cu2O and RGO. Microscopical imaging revealed the intimate contact between the two materials, affecting the size and the distribution of Cu2O nanoparticles on the support. The features of the improved morphology strongly affected the electrochemical behavior of the composites, increasing the activity and the faradaic efficiencies towards the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction process. CU Cu2O/RGO 2:1 composite displayed selective CO formation over H2, with higher currents compared to pristine Cu2O (−0.34 mA/cm2 for Cu2O and −0.64 mA/cm2 for CU Cu2O/RGO 2:1 at the voltage of −0.8 vs. RHE and in a CO2 atmosphere) and a faradaic efficiency of 50% at −0.9 V vs. RHE. This composition exhibited significantly higher CO production compared to the pristine materials, indicating a favorable *CO intermediate pathway even at lower voltages. The systematic investigation on the effects of nanostructuration on composition, morphology and catalytic behavior is a valuable solution for the formation of effective interphases for the promotion of catalytic properties providing crucial insights for future catalysts design and applications.

Energy efficiency is crucial for the sustainable operation of industrial and urban sectors. However, practicing engineers seldom have access to open-source tools that can readily evaluate and compare scenarios. In this work, a novel web-based tool called ROSMOSE is developed and proposed for analyzing the energy efficiency of industrial and urban systems and comparing potential process integration options. This optimization framework computes and graphically represents the minimum energy requirements, the pinch temperatures, and the grand and integrated composite curves of process systems. Results are used to design utility systems that meet energy demands while minimizing a specified objective function such as total cost or environmental impacts. The Quarto environment, in which ROSMOSE is built, allows the integration of various open-source software and tools, such as database handling, process modeling suites, and optimization solvers, along with interactive data visualization and reporting tools. This paper discusses the application of ROSMOSE for the energy integration and total site optimization of a dairy process consisting of milk treatment, cream, and cheese production to demonstrate the tool features. Other integration options, such as the use of heat pumps or solar panels and the production of soft drinks or biogas, are proposed and evaluated. From 75% to 90% in fuel savings and up to 80% CO2 emissions reduction in the dairy plant are identified by optimizing utility integration. Moreover, complete electrification via heat pumps eliminates any gas needs and results in 85% energy savings and up to 96% CO2 emissions reduction. Activating renewable electricity sources, such as solar power, is plausible for this scenario. Finally, optimized waste management strategies lead to energy-autonomous production and net export of biogas to the grid but reduce cheese output due to prioritizing biogas production from whey. In this manner, decision-makers have access to a clear performance comparison for a list of system configurations to draw informed trade-offs. A similar approach could be adopted to aid decision-making for the design and operation of other industrial and urban energy systems using ROSMOSE.

Abstract As a key material for manufacturing clean energy technologies, steel is crucial for energy transition, but its production causes 2.6 Gton of CO2 emissions at global level each year. In 2020 the European Union (EU) set a net-zero emissions target by 2050, fostering innovation in the steel industry to reduce its environmental impact. However, a scenario-oriented and technologically comprehensive analysis assessing prospected environmental and market implications of steel decarbonisation strategies remains a gap, which is addressed in this paper. The analysis adopts a hybrid input-output-based LCA model built in the MARIO framework, extending the Exiobase database to represent the supply chains of the most promising low-carbon steelmaking technologies in the EU, such as hydrogen- or charcoal-injected blast furnaces and natural gas- and hydrogen-based direct reduction routes. The penetration of these technologies is explored by formulating scenarios resembling European climate targets. The results show a reduction in the carbon footprint of steel across all scenarios, ranging up to -26% in 2030 and to -60% in 2050. However, the extent of footprint reduction is highly dependent on the share of clean electricity in the European supply mix, highlighting the relevance of holistic decarbonization strategies. Economic implications affect steel prices, which rise up to 25% in 2030 and 56% in 2050, opening discussions on the need for suitable policies such as CBAM to avoid protectionism and encourage international technological progress.

The development of highly selective and energy efficient technologies for electrochemical CO2 reduction combined with renewable energy sources holds great promise for advancing the field of sustainable chemistry. The engineering of copper-based electrodes facilitates the conversion of CO2 into high-value multicarbon products (C2+). However, the ambiguous determination of the intrinsic CO2 activity and the maximization of the density of exposed active sites have severely limited the use of Cu for the realization of practical electrocatalytic devices. Here, we report a scalable strategy to obtain a high density of undercoordinated sites by maximizing the exposure of grain-boundary active sites using a direct chronoamperometric pulse method. Our numerical investigations predicted that grain boundaries modulate the adsorption behavior of *CO on the Cu surface, which acts as a key intermediate species associated with the production of multicarbon species. We investigated the consequence of grain-boundary density on dendric Cu catalysts (GB-Cu) by combining transmission electron microscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy with electrochemical measurements. A linear relationship between the Faradaic efficiency of the C2+ product and the presence of undercoordinated sites was observed, which allowed to directly quantify the contribution of the grain boundary in Cu-based catalysts on the CO2RR properties and the formation of multicarbon products. Using a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, the high grain-boundary density Cu electrodes achieved a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 73.2% for C2+ product formation and a full-cell energy efficiency of 20.2% at a specific current density of 303.6 mA cm–2. The GB-Cu was implemented in a 25 cm2 MEA electrolyzer and demonstrated selectivity of over 62% for 70 h together with current retention of 88.4% at the applied potential of −3.80 V. The catalysts and electrolyzer were further coupled to an InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple-junction solar cell to demonstrate a solar-to-fuel (STF) conversion efficiency of 8.33%. This work designed an undercoordinated Cu-based catalyst for the realization of solar-driven fuel production.

The injection of CO2 into subsurface reservoirs provides a long term solution for anthropogenic emissions. A variable injection rate (such as ramping the flow rate up or down) provides flexibility to injection sites, and could influence the amount of residual trapping. Observations made in cm-scale samples showed that starting at a low flow rate established a flow pathway across the core, leading to a long term reduction in pore space utilization, as increases in flux were accommodated with little change in saturation. In this work we assess the scalability of these observations by performing experiments with variable injection rates in larger samples: 5 cm diameter and 12 cm length, compared to 2.5 cm diameter and 4.5 cm length in our previous work (Spurin et al., 2024). We observed that starting at a low flow rate did not lead to a long term reduction in pore space utilization. Instead saturation increased significantly with increased flux, leading to a higher pore space utilization than experiments where injection started with the higher flow rate. The difference in observations depending on sample size and the role of heterogeneity highlights potential uncertainties in upscaling experimental observations to field-scale applications.

Abstract Well integrity plays an important role in any subsurface operation since the wellbore connects the target formation with surface facilities. Any compromising of well integrity may lead to unsafe operation, harm the environment, and may lead to complete failure of the project. This study introduces new built setup to study well integrity through permeability measurement of different wellbore components allowing new insights on the risk management of the geologic carbon storage projects. To study wellbore size sections like of casing-cement, cement-rock, or even casing-cement-rock, a large- scale facility was built at our underground laboratory at 150 m underground. The facility weighs approx. 3 tons with a length of 2 m, and a diameter of 0.7 m. It can handle samples of size 80 cm length and 30 cm diameter. Working pressure and temperature are up to 20 MPa, and 100 °C, respectively. The facility is equipped with two chamber real-time permeability measurement system that can determine the effective permeability of wellbore components based on transient method. Effective permeability of casing-cement composites is measured using CO2 at ambient and subzero temperatures to ensure the well integrity during CO2 injection in depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Preparation of casing-cement samples requires special conditions to preserve integrity of the samples and avoid damage. The preliminary results show that the tested samples exhibit expected values of permeability at ambient temperatures (lower than 1×10−17 m2). Subzero temperatures, down to -11 °C have no effect on original permeability i.e., no increase in permeability after thawing. Pressure cycling experiments showed that the effective pressure and exposure time to CO2 play the most important role in permeability degradation. Furthermore, small pure cement cylinders (10 cm× 10 cm) were prepared and tested on a small-scale facility (analogous to the large-scale setup) to compare the results with the composites. In addition, the permeability of the composites was measured -before and after CO2 exposure- with H2 to account for the reduction in permeability due to the geochemical reactions. It was concluded that the permeability has decreased at least in one order from 10−18 m2 to 10−19 m2 owing to the reaction. The large-scale facility has been used for HYPOS (Germany) project and currently working for RETURN (EU) project as well. Its uniqueness is in the broad range of pressure and temperature working conditions and handling wellbore sections of the size 1:1. The results provide new insights into the risk management of storage projects saving time and cost.

Bio-carbon–manganese composites obtained from olive mill wastewater were successfully prepared using manganese acetate as the manganese source and olive wastewater as the carbon precursor. The samples were characterized chemically and texturally by N2 and CO2 adsorption at 77 K and 273 K, respectively, by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction. Electrochemical characterization was carried out by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The samples were evaluated in the electro-Fenton degradation of tetracycline in a typical three-electrode system under natural conditions of pH and temperature (6.5 and 25 °C). The results show that the catalysts have a high catalytic power capable of degrading tetracycline (about 70%) by a three-electron oxygen reduction pathway in which hydroxyl radicals are generated in situ, thus eliminating the need for two catalysts (ORR and Fenton).

The Rnf complex is the primary respiratory enzyme of several anaerobic prokaryotes that transfers electrons from ferredoxin to NAD+ and pumps sodium ions (Na+) across a membrane, powering ATP synthesis. Rnf is widespread in primordial organisms and the evolutionary predecessor of the Na+-pumping NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (Nqr)1. By running in reverse, Rnf reduces ferredoxin with NADH as reductant at the expense of the transmembrane electrochemical ion gradient and provides low potential electrons for nitrogenases as well as CO2 reductases. Yet, the molecular principles that couple the long-range electron transfer to the Na+ translocation across the membrane remain elusive. Here we resolve key functional states along the electron transfer pathway using redox-controlled cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) that, in combination with biochemical functional assays and atomistic molecular simulations, provide key insight into the redox-driven Na+ pumping mechanism. We show that the reduction of the unique membrane-embedded [2Fe2S] cluster in the vestibule between the RnfA/E subunits electrostatically attracts the sodium ions, and in turn, triggers an inward/outward transition with alternating membrane access driving the Na+ pump and the reduction of NAD+. Our study unveils an ancient mechanism for redox-driven ion pumping, and provides key understanding of the fundamental principles governing energy conversion in biological systems.

Abstract CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) is increasingly relied upon as a significant contributor to the overall reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the transportation and injection of CO2 presents significant challenges to engineers, in terms of risk mitigation for the facilities, economics and feasibility. This paper focuses on the thermo-hydraulic connection between surface facilities and reservoir characteristics such as size, permeability, porosity, that ultimately determines the total amount of stored CO2, and the maximum achievable flow rates. As reservoir conditions and the number, type, and size of emitters change over time, this connection plays a key role in the overall feasibility of the project. Furthermore, we examine how the presence of different impurities may add significant uncertainty, which requires careful evaluation of the mixture's physical and thermodynamic properties. This approach ensures the asset's physical constraints are correctly taken into account. Through the novel use of a flexible life-of-field simulator, based on first principles and rigorous thermodynamics, we show that a holistic approach to modelling the whole asset comprised of surface facilities as well as subsurface stores, represents a crucial tool to design, plan and optimize the performance of the CCS hub. Based on the simulation of various case studies, representing different scenarios, we identify the physical constraints of the asset, and highlight methods and strategies to solve the challenges that may hinder the feasibility and sustainability of the project in the long term. The combined modelling integration of process, production, and injection facilities (e.g., pumps, compressors, heaters, pipelines, and wells), a simplified representation of the reservoir, and rigorous thermodynamics enable us to evaluate and compare different operating strategies from various angles. These include power and pressure requirements, achievable injection rates, and estimation of the overall project lifecycle, while monitoring the facility's flow assurance and integrity risks. As boundary conditions change, the continuity of flow between transport and injection facilities determines a variability in thermohydraulic behaviour that can only be examined using an integrated asset modelling approach. Furthermore, the unique thermodynamic properties of CO2, combined with the variability of the concentration's impurities, adds complexity to effectively evaluate the design and operating strategies. Such complexity implies that simple non-compositional approaches are ill-suited for evaluating the feasibility of the project.

In recent years, anaerobic oxidation of methane with iron and manganese oxides as electron acceptors has been confirmed to exist in electrochemical constructed wetlands (CW), and this process is an important way to reduce methane emissions. However, the internal mechanisms of emission reduction, microbial ecological networks, and electron transfer mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that AOM driven by iron and manganese oxides (Fe/Mn-AOM) reduced methane emissions by more than 50.86% in constructed wetland – microbial fuel cell (CW-MFC) systems. In iron and manganese systems, the relative abundance of microorganisms associated with methane metabolism (methanotrophic bacteria) increased significantly. AOM-related microorganisms cooperated with other microorganisms to form a robust and stable microbial ecological network. In the process of methane metabolism, there was an increase in the proportion of reverse methanogenic genes in iron and manganese systems, with the proportion of mcr genes being 1.75 and 1.79 times that of control systems. The key genes (cyc1 and cox11) that influence cytochrome C synthesis in AOM process were significantly enriched, resulting in enhanced electron transfer process. The coexistence of iron and manganese oxides enabled the simultaneous biochemical processes of CH4 oxidation and CO2 reduction within a single system. Additionally, the increase in humic acid also facilitated electron transfer, thereby significantly enhancing the removal efficiency of COD, TN, and TP in the CW-MFC systems. This study reveals the potential mechanism of Fe/Mn-AOM for CW-MFC methane emission reduction, which can provide a theoretical basis for the collaborative treatment of sewage and methane control in CWs, so as to achieve the maximum environmental benefits of CW.

The affinity of oxygen (O)-bound species is a key factor in CO2 reduction (CO2R) reactions (including C1 and C2+ products), although existing experimental methods cannot quantitatively track the O atoms active within CO2R reactions in real time. Among the diversified products from CO2R reactions, the formate (HCOO−) possesses the highest profit per mole of electrons. Here, we report an operando electrochemical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method, which allows to quantitatively describe the complex species containing O atoms during the electrochemical CO2R reactions. Based on Cu and bimetallic Cu-based materials (Bi2CuO4 and In2Cu2O5) systems, we found that by introducing Bi and In metal adsorption sites, the O atoms of adsorbed H2O can directly involve in the formation of HCOO− through a water-assisted mechanism (∗COOH− regeneration), thereby improving the selectivity of liquid HCOO− product mostly from 34.2% to 98%. This strategy gives valuable insights into the design of HCOO−-favored catalysts.

Centrifugal pumps consume majority of energy used by the electric motor driven systems among all end users of the industrial sector. Only in European region, a 1% improvement in efficiency (η) of the centrifugal pump is capable enough to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 572 tons per day. The prime motive of this research is to assess the applicability of the novel back cavity filling (BCF) in reducing the disk friction losses of centrifugal pumps without changing the pump's original design. By adding a solid ring to the bearing housing's back-cover plate, the BCF was applied to a medium specific speed pump (Ns = 54 rpm), resulting in a 1 mm back axial clearance from 13 mm. Numerical simulations and experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of BCF on pump performance under two conditions: with and without BCF at best efficient point (BEP) and various partload conditions for 1450 rpm (rated) as well as 1000 rpm. Pump performance characteristics were enhanced by BCF at both rpms for the whole flow rate range. At 1450 rpm, BCF resulted in an average 0.74% increment in total head, 2.08% reduction in input torque, and 2.70% increment in overall efficiency over the flow rate range. While an average 2.04% improvement in total head, 1.33% reduction in input torque, a 3.30% enhancement in overall efficiency were obtained at 1000 rpm. Performance parameter enhancement was higher at lowest part load compared to the BEP on rated rpm.

Electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and solvation effects can alter the free energies of ionizable functional groups in proteins and other enclosed porous architectures, allowing these nanostructures to tune acid-base chemistry as needed to support specific functions. Herein, we expand on this theme to examine how metal sites (M = H2, ZnII, CoII, CoI) affect the pKa of benzoic acid guests bound in discrete porphyrin nanoprisms (M3TriCage), which were chosen as model systems for better understanding how porous metalloporphyrin electrocatalysts might influence H+ transfer processes that are needed to support many important electrochemical reactions (e.g., reductions of H+, O2, or CO2). Lewis acidic CoII and ZnII ions increase the Brønsted acidities of the guests by 4 and 8 pKa units, respectively, while reduction of the CoII sites to anionic CoI sites produces an electrostatic potential that lowers acidity by ca. 4 units (8 units relative to the CoII state). Lacking functional metal sites, H6TriCage increases the acidity of the guests by just 2.5 pKa units despite the 12+ charge of the host and contributions from other factors (hydrogen bonding, pore hydration) that might stabilize the depro-tonated guests. Thus, the metal sites have dominant effects on acid-base chemistry in the M3TriCages, providing a larger pKa range (12.75 to ≥24.5 in CD3CN) for the encapsulated acid than attained via other confinement effects in proteins and artificial porous materials.

Abstract The advent of digital health technologies has transformed the landscape of healthcare delivery and sustainable practice, with dermatology being no exception. National Health Service (NHS) England reported carbon emissions of 27.1 million tonnes from the health and social care system in 2017, equating to 6.3% of England’s emissions [NHS England. Delivering a ‘net zero’ National Health Service. Available at: https://www.england.nhs.uk/greenernhs/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2020/10/delivering-a-net-zero-national-health-service.pdf (last accessed 19 March 2024)]. Subsequently, the initiation of the NHS campaign ‘For a Greener NHS’ was introduced to ensure stakeholders are mindful of their healthcare delivery. This project delves into the sustainability implications of transitioning from traditional paper-based patient information leaflets (PILs) to online platforms within the field of dermatology. Focusing on environmental, economic, patient and healthcare delivery perspectives, the project aims to elucidate the benefits and challenges associated with this digital shift. A quality improvement project was used to propose a new lean pathway for educating patients using digital PILs. Quantitative data assessed printing habits from the outpatient department printer over 2 weeks prior to any intervention. Printing habits were reassessed for a further 2 weeks after QR codes to PILs were left in the dermatology clinic rooms and clinicians were encouraged to avoid printing PILs where feasible. Carbon emissions and cost analyses were calculated to quantify the effect of digital PILs. Qualitative data through a survey disseminated to patients and clinicians assessed the impact of digital PILs on healthcare delivery, patient engagement, and information accessibility. The results demonstrated that over the first 2-week period 1723 pages were printed, which equated to 8615g CO2 equivalent. Implementation of the digital PILs resulted in 1596 pages printed, equating to 7980g CO2 equivalent. This equates to 16 510g of CO2 emissions and £317.50 in costs potentially saved annually when switching to digital PILs. This is equivalent to the CO2 emitted by fully charging 2068 smartphones [US Environmental Protection Agency. Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator. 2024. Available at: https://www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator (last accessed 19 March 2024)]. Preliminary qualitative results illustrated the reluctance of particular age groups to engage in digital PILs due to poor technology literacy. However, there was an awareness among patients and dermatologists to implement sustainable education. Our findings demonstrate that digital PILs foster a reduction in the carbon footprint and costs. The increasing prevalence of smartphones and internet connectivity gives digital platforms the potential to enhance patient education, engagement, and adherence to treatment plans. However, considerations related to digital literacy, accessibility and data security need to be addressed to ensure equitable healthcare delivery. Through a synthesis of environmental, economic and healthcare delivery perspectives, our findings aim to guide healthcare providers in making informed decisions regarding the adoption of digital platforms for sustainable patient information dissemination.

BACKGROUND Laparoscopic-assisted radical gastrectomy (LARG) is the standard treatment for early-stage gastric carcinoma (GC). However, the negative impact of this procedure on respiratory function requires the optimized intraoperative management of patients in terms of ventilation. AIM To investigate the influence of pressure-controlled ventilation volume-guaranteed (PCV-VG) and volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) on blood gas analysis and pulmonary ventilation in patients undergoing LARG for GC based on the lung ultrasound score (LUS). METHODS The study included 103 patients with GC undergoing LARG from May 2020 to May 2023, with 52 cases undergoing PCV-VG (research group) and 51 cases undergoing VCV (control group). LUS were recorded at the time of entering the operating room (T0), 20 minutes after anesthesia with endotracheal intubation (T1), 30 minutes after artificial pneumoperitoneum (PP) establishment (T2), and 15 minutes after endotracheal tube removal (T5). For blood gas analysis, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) were observed. Peak airway pressure (Ppeak), plateau pressure (Pplat), mean airway pressure (Pmean), and dynamic pulmonary compliance (Cdyn) were recorded at T1 and T2, 1 hour after PP establishment (T3), and at the end of the operation (T4). Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) were recorded. Pre- and postoperative serum interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS Compared with those at T0, the whole, anterior, lateral, posterior, upper, lower, left, and right lung LUS of the research group were significantly reduced at T1, T2, and T5; in the control group, the LUS of the whole and partial lung regions (posterior, lower, and right lung) decreased significantly at T2, while at T5, the LUS of the whole and some regions (lateral, lower, and left lung) increased significantly. In comparison with the control group, the whole and regional LUS of the research group were reduced at T1, T2, and T5, with an increase in PaO2, decrease in PaCO2, reduction in Ppeak at T1 to T4, increase in Pmean and Cdyn, and decrease in Pplat at T4, all significant. The research group showed a significantly lower incidence of PPCs than the control group within 3 days postoperatively. Postoperative IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α significantly increased in both groups, with even higher levels in the control group. CONCLUSION LUS can indicate intraoperative non-uniformity and postural changes in pulmonary ventilation under PCV-VG and VCV. Under the lung protective ventilation strategy, the PCV-VG mode more significantly improved intraoperative lung ventilation in patients undergoing LARG for GC and reduced lung injury-related cytokine production, thereby alleviating lung injury.

Bismuth-based catalysts have demonstrated significant electrocatalytic activity in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce formate/formic acid, while the morphology of these catalysts is considered to be crucial for their electrocatalytic performance. However, the potential topological transformation of Bi-based catalysts during CO2RR catalysis has been largely overlooked, which could lead to an underlying lack of understanding of the structure–activity relationship. In this study, various morphologies of bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3), including nanowires, nanoribbons, nanospheres, nanoparticles, and commercially available bulk powders of Bi2S3, were systematically investigated for the electrocatalytic CO2RR in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. Surprisingly, all of these morphologies exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activities for formate synthesis, with high Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 90%. Meanwhile, no significant distinction could be observed regarding their catalytic performance during long-term operation. During the CO2RR process, all Bi2S3 morphologies initially turn into similar nanocomposites of Bi and Bi2O2CO3 sheets, which subsequently undergo a topotactic transformation into metallic Bi nanoparticles. Theoretical calculations indicate that such a topotactic transformation is conducive to the CO2RR due to the superior activity and selectivity of metallic Bi nanoparticles. These findings shed light on the impact of the topotactic transformation of bismuth-based catalysts on the CO2RR, providing insights into the structure–activity relationship.

While the ambient N2 reduction to ammonia (NH3) using H2O as hydrogen source (2N2+6H2O=4NH3+3O2) is known as a promising alternative to the Haber‐Bosch process, the high bond energy of N≡N bond leads to the extremely low NH3 yield. Herein, we report a highly efficient catalytic system for ammonia synthesis using the low‐temperature dielectric barrier discharge plasma to activate inert N2 molecules into the activated nitrogen species, which can efficiently react with the confined and concentrated H2O molecules in porous metal‐organic framework (MOF) reactors with V3+, Cr3+, Mn3+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ ions. Specially, the Fe‐based catalyst MIL‐100(Fe) causes a superhigh NH3 yield of 22.4 mmol g‐1 h‐1. The investigation of catalytic performance and systematic characterizations of MIL‐100(Fe) during the plasma‐driven catalytic reaction unveils that the in situ generated defective Fe‐O clusters are the highly active sites and NH3 molecules indeed form inside the MIL‐100(Fe) reactor. The theoretical calculation reveals that the porous MOF catalysts have different adsorption capacity for nitrogen species on different catalytic metal sites, where the optimal MIL‐100(Fe) has the lowest energy barrier for the rate‐limiting *NNH formation step, significantly enhancing efficiency of nitrogen fixation.

Microbial grouting technology based on microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) is a new soil improvement method. This technique involves injecting bacteria and a cementation solution into soil pores to generate CaCO3 precipitation, thereby enhancing soil strength. Studies on microbial grouting from the aspects of experimental studies, theoretical models and engineering applications were extensively reviewed. Factors such as grouting methods, grouting rate, cementation solution concentration, and pH significantly influence the size and distribution of CaCO3. The three-phase grouting method enhances bacterial adsorption and soil strength. The higher grouting rate (grouting rate greater than reaction rate) and low pH (pH is not lower than 4) facilitate the uniform distribution of CaCO3. The size of CaCO3 and the soil strength increase with increasing cementation solution concentration. The existing models were established based on equilibrium flow, which overlooks the reduction of solute migration distance caused by the non-uniformity of the medium. Micro-structural analysis shows that CaCO3 precipitation between adjacent soil particles acts as a matrix supporting to increase soil strength. Microbial grouting technology can employ CaCO3 precipitation to seal wellbore cracks for CO2 storage and cement soil particles for slope stability and foundation improvement. Finally, the challenges encountered in microbial grouting technology were discussed.

Dietary fibre (DF) is important for overall health and disease prevention. However, the intake of DF in Westernised countries is below the recommended level, largely due to the excessive consumption of low-fibre foods. Fortifying staple foods, such as bread, with dietary fibre ingredients is one approach to closing the fibre gap in our diet. However, incorporating purified and chemically modified fibre ingredients into food is challenging. This study unveils interactions between soluble–fermentable (arabinoxylan), insoluble–fermentable (resistant starch type IV) and insoluble–unfermentable (cellulose) fibre ingredients and their impact on bread quality using Response Surface Methodology. This resulted in an optimised mixture of these fibre ingredients that can coexist within a bread matrix while maintaining quality characteristics comparable to white wheat bread. The partial replacement of flour with fibre ingredients led to an interference with the gluten network causing a reduction in gluten strength by 12.4% and prolonged gluten network development time by 24.4% compared to the control (no fibre addition). However, the CO2 retention coefficient during dough fermentation was not affected by fibre ingredient inclusion. The fibre content of the white bread was increased by 128%, with only a marginal negative impact on bread quality. Additionally, the fibre-fortified bread showed a lower release of reducing sugars during in vitro starch digestion. This study illustrates the synergy of different types of fibre ingredients in a bread system to advance in closing the fibre gap.

The carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR) toward C2+ and C3+ products such as propylene and cyclopropane can not only reduce anthropogenic emissions of CO and CO2 but also produce value-added organic chemicals for polymer and pharmaceutical industries. Here, we introduce the concept of triple atom catalysts (TACs) that have three intrinsically strained and active metal centers for reducing CO to C3+ products. We applied grand canonical potential kinetics (GCP-K) to screen 12 transition metals (M) supported by nitrogen-doped graphene denoted as M3N7, where M stands for Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Ir, Pt, and Au. We sought catalysts with favorable CO binding, hydrogen binding, and C–C dimerization energetics, identifying Fe3N7 and Ir3N7 as the best candidates. We then studied the entire reaction mechanism from CO to C3H6 and C2H4 as a function of applied potential via, respectively, 12-electron and 8-electron transfer pathways on Fe3N7 and Ir3N7. Density functional theory (DFT) predicts an overpotential of 0.17 VRHE for Fe3N7 toward propylene and an overpotential of 0.42 VRHE toward cyclopropane at 298.15 K and pH = 7. Also, DFT predicts an overpotential of 0.15 VRHE for Ir3N7 toward ethylene. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of advanced catalysts for C2+ and C3+ synthesis at room temperature.

High light (HL) significantly impacts plant photosynthesis. This study investigated the effects of different magnesium (Mg) levels (0, 1, 2, and 5 mol Mg plant⁻1; HMg0, HMg1, HMg2, and HMg5) on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Cuibi No. 1) under HL (1500 μmol m⁻2 s⁻1), aiming to understand the role of Mg in mitigating the impact of HL on photosynthesis and carbon–nitrogen metabolism. Plants treated with 1 mol Mg plant⁻1 under 750 μmol m⁻2 s⁻1 light conditions served as the control. HL led to a reduced chlorophyll (Chl) content and inhibited the maximum photosynthetic rate (Pmax). It also decreased energy involved in photosynthetic electron transfer (ET) and electron flux to reduction end-electron acceptors at the photosystems I (PSI) acceptor side (RE) and caused photosynthetic system damage. H2O2 accumulation exacerbated membrane lipid peroxidation damage, disrupting carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and inducing antioxidant enzyme activity. HMg2 increased Chl content, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, and the net photosynthetic rate compared to HMg0. It enhanced ET efficiency, PSI and PSII functionality, reduced dissipated energy flux (DI), and minimized photosynthesis damage. Conversely, excessive Mg application (HMg5) decreased Pmax and PSII activity, increasing DI. Adequate Mg supply alleviated HL’s detrimental effects by enhancing Chl content and ET and RE efficiency.

Institutions of higher learning in South Africa are grappling with occasional power outages in lecture halls, leading to disruptions in academic activities and occasional loss of lecture hours. Therefore, this study presents a comprehensive evaluation of a grid-connected solar PV/Li-ion battery microgrid (μG) system aimed at maintaining a constant power supply to selected lecture halls at a university in the Western Cape, South Africa. The microgrid design, modelling, and simulations, conducted in the MATLAB/Simulink environment, include the solar PV, Li-ion battery, energy consumption of the lecture halls (load profile), boost converter, bidirectional converter, and grid. Using the detailed design, modelling, and simulation, the study evaluates the economic and environmental impacts of integrating μGs, focusing on enhancing energy reliability, reducing operational costs, and mitigating CO2 emissions. The results indicate that integrating the microgrid resulted in a significant 51% reduction in energy cost and a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 530 kgCO2e per hour. In Cases 2 and 4, where the battery supplied power, the annual battery degradation costs are 6.08% and 14.9% of the initial cost, respectively. The μG ensures an uninterrupted power supply and improves the overall reliability of the university’s energy infrastructure. It promotes environmental sustainability goals of zero emissions and maintains continuous academic activities during grid outages. Furthermore, it fosters a conducive learning environment, supports innovation and creativity in sustainable energy technologies, and sets a standard for other higher education institutions to integrate renewable energy-powered μGs.

The Shimensi super-large tungsten polymetallic deposit is located in the Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous Porphyry–Skarn tungsten ore belt in the south Yangtze metallogenic belt. There are three types of mineralization: veinlet-disseminated type, thick quartz vein type and hydrothermal cryptoexplosive breccia type. Based on geological studies, this paper presents new petrographic, microthermometric, laser Raman spectroscopic and hydrogen and oxygen isotope research on the fluid inclusions from the deposit. The results show that there are five different types of fluid inclusions: liquid-rich inclusions, vapor-rich inclusions, pure liquid inclusions, pure vapor inclusions, and fluid inclusions containing a solid crystal. The homogenization temperatures of the fluid inclusion range from 140 °C to 270 °C, the salinities are 3 wt.%–5 wt.% NaCleq and the densities of ore-forming fluid range from 0.64 g/cm3 to 0.99 g/cm3. For the analyses of laser Raman spectroscopy, the ore-forming fluids can be approximated by a Ca2+-Na+-SO42−-Cl− fluid system with small amounts of CO2, CH4 and N2. Otherwise, the data of the pressure, pH and Eh show a fluid metallogenic environment of low pressure, weak acid and weak reduction. The values of the homogenization temperature in the three types of orebodies suggest that the mineralization is characterized by a decrease in temperature under the conditions of fluid immiscibility. The H-O isotope values are interpreted to indicate that the ore-forming fluids are mainly composed of magmatic water, and meteoric water is added with the process of magma rising.

L-asparaginase (L-asnase) is a versatile enzyme with uses in food industry and medicine. Current study aimed to isolate L-asnase producing microorganism/s without urease and glutaminase and optimize L-asnase production. First, screening and isolation of L-asnase-producing bacterial strains that did not produce glutaminase and urease from chicken gizzards were performed. For this purpose, the enzyme producing bacteria were screened on the agar medium supplied with substrate and phenol red indicator dye. Among the isolated bacteria, 1 isolate showed L-asnase free of glutaminase and urease. The selected strain was identified by biochemical, morphological and 16s rRNA sequencing. The selected strain was identified as Bacillus atrophaeus by 16S rRNA sequencing. The effects of incubation temperature (30°C) and time (72 hours), medium pH (8.0) and nutritional sources (glucose and NaNO3) on L-asnase production were determined. L-asnase was purified with acetone, and its molecular weight was determined to be 42 kDa by SDS-Page. Enzyme kinetics were also calculated, and it was determined that Vmax was 43 μmol/mL/min and Km was 2.7 mM. L-asnase activity was highest at 40 ℃ and the optimal pH was 8.0. L-asnase activity was stimulated by Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ but inhibited by Co2+, Na+, Zn2+, and Hg2+. L-asnase was utilized to treat potato chips before they were fried in order to assess its capacity to mitigate acrylamide. The result was an 80% reduction in acrylamide concentration when compared to the untreated control. Based on these findings, it appears that L-asnase could have potential use in the food industry.

Density functional theory (DFT) modeling has been useful to electrocatalyst research, yet simulating the complexities of the electrode–electrolyte interface hinders progress in understanding reaction mechanisms and the underlying kinetics. Though many approaches to incorporating electrochemical double layer (EDL) features in DFT calculations have been developed, uncertainty in interfacial solvent properties and the distribution of ions leave the impact of the EDL on electrocatalytic kinetics unclear. Elucidating the sensitivity of DFT predictions to the EDL properties and model is crucial. Herein, we use an analytical Grand Canonical DFT framework (aGC-DFT) to quantify the sensitivity of potential-dependent activation energies to parameters of the EDL, incorporating a Helmholtz EDL model with varying dielectric constant (εr) and EDL width (d). We compute the activation barriers for OC–H, CO–H, and OC–CO bond formation from CO* on Cu. These elementary reactions are critical within the heavily debated reaction mechanism of CO2 reduction and are likely to impact overall activity and product selectivity. We show the aGC-DFT method produces consistent results with explicit GC-DFT calculations, while enabling probing of the EDL model sensitivity at a much lower computational cost. Reaction steps with significant dipole moment changes (i.e., CO–H bond formation) are highly sensitive to the chosen EDL parameters, such that the relative barriers of the OC–H, CO–H, and OC–CO bond formation steps depend significantly on EDL properties. Without knowledge of the interfacial properties of the EDL, there is substantial uncertainty in activation barriers and elementary reaction rates within a DFT analysis of electrocatalytic kinetics.

Nutrient requirement for crop growth, defined as the amount of nutrient that crops take up from soil to produce a specific grain yield, is a key parameter in determining fertilizer application rate. However, existing studies primarily focus on identifying nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) requirements solely in relation to grain yield, neglecting grain protein content, a crucial index for wheat grain quality. Addressing this gap, we conducted multi-site, multi-cultivar, and multi-year field trials across three ecological regions of China from 2016 to 2020 to elucidate variations in nutrient requirements for grain yield and grain protein. The research findings revealed that wheat grain yield ranged from 4.1 to 9.3 Mg ha−1 (average 6.9 Mg ha−1) and grain protein content ranged from 98 to 157 g kg−1 (average 127 g kg−1) across the three regions. Notably, the N requirement exhibited a nonlinear correlation with the wheat grain yield but a linear increase with increasing grain protein, while the P and K requirements positively correlated with grain yield and protein content. Regression models were formulated to determine the nutrient requirements (MENR), enabling the prediction of N, P, and K requirements for leading cultivars with varying grain yields and protein contents. Implementing nutrient requirements based on MENR projections resulted in substantial reductions in fertilizer rates: 22.0 kg ha−1 N (10.7 %), 9.9 kg ha−1 P (20.2 %), and 8.1 kg ha−1 K (16.3 %). This translated to potential savings of 0.4 Mt. N, 0.23 Mt. P, and 0.17 Mt. K, consequently mitigating 5.5 Mt. CO2 greenhouse-gas emission and yielding an economic benefit of 0.8 billion US$ annually in China. These findings underscore the significance of considering grain yield and protein content in estimating nutrient requirements for fertilizer recommendations to realize high-yielding, high-protein wheat production, and minimize overfertilization and associated environmental risks.

Abstract Considering future developments and plans of decarbonization, the H2 pipeline transport technology will play a key role, and it could also be implemented as a component of an integrated system with CO2 pipelines (i.e. blue hydrogen). A key aspect of H2 technology development is the possibility to use existing natural gas transport infrastructure to be retrofitted for H2 transport. It is recognized that the transport of natural gas mixtures containing a 10% of hydrogen content could be in general feasible in existing onshore natural gas pipeline systems with minor modifications. Higher hydrogen contents, however, appear to have a large impact on the system components, requiring significant modifications instead. The more important bottleneck is related to the utilization of carbon steel grades normally used for natural gas transmission pipelines. Most of literature sources report a higher susceptibility of high steel grades to hydrogen embrittlement, i.e. the loss of toughness in steel which results from adsorption of hydrogen. Corresponding to the loss of net material toughness is a reduction in fatigue life, causing crack growth and propagation. There is a need to complement existing standards on hydrogen piping, pipeline and their components part of the hydrogen value chain to fulfill the energy transition design scenarios and the need to reuse existing gas transport infrastructure to support the economics of the transition. This translates to the definition of a clear methodology to carry out the assessment of existing natural gas pipeline systems (both onshore and offshore), in such a way to identify the tolerance to hydrogen of the different system components. All the engineering disciplines need to be involved, including piping & materials, machinery, instrumentation, as well as loss prevention & safety. Since the potential transport service conversion is normally carried out in steps, starting from a low H2 content in the blend with natural gas up to possibly 100% H2, the number of affected components will increase during this evolution; some of them could be ready to tolerate 100% H2 from the beginning, others will need some modifications, while some will need a complete replacement. This paper presents a description of Saipem methodology, that has been applied to a number of conversion studies relevant to transport systems mainly located in Europe.

Abstract. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are powerful anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) with high global-warming potentials (GWPs). They have been widely used as refrigerants, insulation foam-blowing agents, aerosol propellants, and fire suppression agents. Since the mid-1990s, emissions of HFCs have been increasing rapidly as they are used in many applications to replace ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) whose consumption and production have been phased out under the Montreal Protocol (MP). Due to the high GWP of HFCs, the Kigali Amendment to the MP requires the phasedown of production and consumption of HFCs to gradually achieve an 80 %–85 % reduction by 2047, starting in 2019 for non-Article 5 (developed) countries with a 10 % reduction against each defined baseline and later schedules for Article 5 (developing) countries. In this study, we have examined long-term high-precision measurements of atmospheric abundances of five major HFCs (HFC-134a, HFC-143a, HFC-32, HFC-125, and HFC-152a) at Gosan station, Jeju Island, South Korea, from 2008 to 2020. Background abundances of HFCs gradually increased, and the inflow of polluted air masses with elevated abundances from surrounding source regions were detected over the entire period. From these pollution events, we inferred regional and country-specific HFC emission estimates using two independent Lagrangian particle dispersion models and Bayesian inversion frameworks (FLEXPART-FLEXINVERT+ and NAME-InTEM). The spatial distribution of the derived “top-down” (measurement based) emissions for all HFCs shows large fluxes from megacities and industrial areas in the region. Our most important finding is that HFC emissions in eastern China and Japan have sharply increased from 2016 to 2018. The contribution of East Asian HFC emissions to the global total increased from 9 % (2008–2014) to 13 % (2016–2020). In particular, HFC emissions in Japan (Annex I country) rose rapidly from 2016 onward, with accumulated total inferred HFC emissions being ∼ 114 Gg yr−1, which is ∼ 76 Gg yr−1 higher for 2016–2020 than the “bottom-up” (i.e., based on activity data and emission factors) emissions of ∼ 38 Gg yr−1 reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This is likely related to the increase in domestic demand in Japan for refrigerants and air-conditioning-system-related products and incomplete accounting. A downward trend of HFC emissions that started in 2019 reflects the effectiveness of the F-gas policy in Japan. Eastern China and South Korea, though not obligated to report to the UNFCCC, voluntarily reported emissions, which also show differences between top-down and bottom-up emission estimates, demonstrating the need for atmospheric measurements, comprehensive data analysis, and accurate reporting for precise emission management. Further, the proportional contribution of each country's CO2-equivalent HFC emissions has changed over time, with HFC-134a decreasing and HFC-125 increasing. This demonstrates the transition in the predominant HFC substances contributing to global warming in each country.

The rising electricity costs, cost of space heating, and domestic hot water end up driving consumers toward reducing expenses by generating their electricity through devices like photovoltaic systems and efficient combined heat and power plants. When coupled with thermal systems via an energy management system (EMS) in a Multi-Energy System (MES), this self-produced electricity can effectively lower electricity and heating bills. However, MESs with EMSs can serve various purposes beyond cost reduction via self-consumption, such as reacting to variable electricity prices, meeting special grid connection conditions, or minimizing CO2 emissions. These diverse strategies create unique prosumer profiles, deviating significantly from standard load profiles. The potential threat to the power grid arises as grid operators lack visibility into which consumers employ which control strategies. This paper investigates the impact of controlled MESs on the power grid compared to average households and answers whether new control strategies affect the planning strategies of low voltage grids. It proposes a comprehensive four-step toolchain for the detailed simulation of thermal–electrical load profiles, MES control strategies, and grid dynamics. It includes a new method for the grid impact analysis of extreme and average bulk values. As a result, this study identifies three primary factors influencing distribution power grids by MESs. Firstly, the presence and scale of photovoltaic (PV) systems significantly affect extreme values in the grid. Secondly, MESs incorporating combined heat and power (CHP) and heat pump (HP) units impact the overall grid performance, mainly reflected in bulk values. Thirdly, the placement of an MES with heating systems, especially when concentrated in one feeder, plays a crucial role in grid dynamics. Despite the three distinct factors identified as impactful on the power grid, this study reveals that the various control strategies, despite leading to vastly different grid profiles, do not exhibit divergent impacts on buses, lines, or transformers. Remarkably, the impact of MESs remains consistently similar across the range of control strategies studied. Therefore, different control strategies do not pose an additional challenge to the grid integration of MESs.

Photoelectrochemical (PEC) systems are promising approaches for sustainable fuel processing. PEC devices, like conventional photovoltaic-electrolyzer (PV-EC) systems, utilize solar energy for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. Contrary to PV-EC systems, PEC devices integrate the photoabsorber, the ionic membrane, and the catalysts into a single reactor. This integration of elements potentially makes PEC systems simpler in design, increases efficiency, offers a cost advantage, and allows for implementation with higher flexibility in use. We present a detailed techno-economic evaluation of PEC systems with three different device designs. We combine a system-level techno-economic analysis based on physical performance models (including degradation) with stochastic methods for uncertainty assessments, also considering the use of PV and EC learning curves for future cost scenarios. For hydrogen, we assess different PEC device design options (utilizing liquid or water vapor as reactant) and compare them to conventional PV-EC systems (anion or cation exchange). We show that in the current scenario, PEC systems (with a levelized cost of hydrogen of 6.32 $/kgH2) located in southern Spain are not yet competitive, operating at 64% higher costs than the PV-driven anion exchange EC systems. Our analysis indicates that PEC plants' material and size are the most significant factors affecting hydrogen costs. PEC designs operating with water vapor are the most economical designs, with the potential to cost about 10% less than PV-EC systems and to reach a 2 $/kgH2 target by 2040. If a sunlight concentrator is incorporated, the PEC-produced hydrogen cost is significantly lower (3.59 $/kgH2 in the current scenario). Versions of the concentrated PEC system that incorporate reversible operation and CO2 reduction indicate a levelized cost of storage of 0.2803 $/kWh for the former and a levelized cost of CO of 0.546 $/kgCO for the latter. These findings demonstrate the competitiveness and viability of (concentrated) PEC systems and their versatile use cases. Our study shows the potential of PEC devices and systems for hydrogen production (current and future potential), storage applications, and CO production, thereby highlighting the importance of sustainable and cost-effective design considerations for future advancements in technology development in this field.

Here, we comprehensively investigated methanol electrooxidation on Cu-based catalysts, allowing us to build the first microfluidic fuel cell (μFC) equipped with a Cu anode and a metal-free cathode that converts energy from methanol. We applied a simple, fast, small-scale, and surfactant-free strategy for synthesizing Cu-based nanoparticles at room temperature in steady state (ST), under mechanical stirring (MS), or under ultrasonication (US). The morphology evaluation of the Cu-based samples reveals that they have the same nanoparticle (NP) needle-like form. The elemental mapping composition spectra revealed that pure Cu or Cu oxides were obtained for all synthesized materials. In addition to having more Cu2O on the surface, sample US had more Cu(OH)2 than the others, according to X-ray diffractograms and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The sample US is less carbon-contaminated because of the local heating of the sonic bath, which also enhances the cleanliness of the Cu surface. The activity of the Cu NPs was investigated for methanol electrooxidation in an alkaline medium through electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical measurements. The potentiodynamic and potentiostatic experiments showed higher current densities for the NPs synthesized in the US. In situ FTIR experiments revealed that the three synthesized NP materials eletcrooxidize methanol completely to carbonate through formate. Most importantly, all pathways were led without detectable CO, a poisoning molecule not found at high overpotentials. The reaction path using the US electrode experienced an additional round of formate formation and conversion into carbonate (or CO2 in the thin layer) after 1.0 V (vs. Ag/Ag/Cl), suggesting improved catalysis. The high activity of NPs synthesized in the US is attributed to effective dissociative adsorption of the fuel due to the site's availability and the presence of hydroxyl groups that may fasten the oxidation of adsorbates from the surface. After understanding the surface reaction, we built a mixed-media μFC fed by methanol in alkaline medium and sodium persulfate in acidic medium. The μFC was equipped with Cu NPs synthesized in ultrasonic-bath-modified carbon paper as the anode and metal-free carbon paper as the cathode. Since the onset potential for methanol electrooxidation was 0.45 V and the reduction reaction revealed 0.90 V, the theoretical OCV is 0.45 V, which provides a spontaneous coupled redox reaction to produce power. The μFC displayed 0.56 mA cm–2 of maximum current density and 26 μW cm–2 of peak power density at 100 μL min–1. This membraneless system optimizes each half-cell individually, making it possible to build fuel cells with noble metal-free anodes and metal-free cathodes.

Abstract The influence of individual solvents (ethyl acetate and tetralin) as hydrogen donors on the nature of the conversion of organic matter of low-permeable shale Domanik rock from the Mendym deposits of the Upper Devonian of the Tavel deposit (Tatarstan, Russia) during hydrothermal processes was studied. The experiments were carried out at a temperature of 300°C in a CO2 environment with a water content in the reaction system of a 1:1 to sample of rock and an exposure time of 24 hours. The degree of conversion of kerogen into extractable hydrocarbons was determined by Rock-Eval and thermal analysis methods. The changes in the composition of the formed hydrocarbons were evaluated using different technic such as gas chromatography (GC) analysis of evolved gasses, SARA analysis, GC-MS of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons) and elemental analysis before and after hydrothermal experiments. The results showed that, ethyl acetate does not exhibit the properties of a hydrogen proton donor but intensifies the destruction of kerogen. The results of GC-MS showed that, the ethyl acetate almost completely decomposes to acetic acid, which, in turn, due to its effect on the carbonate component of the rock, promotes the extraction of high-molecular components associated with the rock and the destruction of kerogen along the least stable C-S bonds. This is demonstrated by a higher presence of H2S in the gas composition compared to the control hydrothermal experiment. Additionally, there's an increase in the yield of extract from the rock, along with a higher content of high molecular weight components, consequently raising the sulfur content and the abundance of benzothiophenes in the aromatic fraction. Under these experimental conditions, tetralin not only enhances the conversion of organic matter from the Domanik rock into extractable hydrocarbons but also facilitates the removal of heteroatomic compounds by transferring hydrogen donors, which inhibit radical reactions. This leads to the elimination of alkyl substituents and the formation of lower molecular weight hydrocarbons. The results of GC-MS measurements of the aromatic hydrocarbons obtained confirm these processes. Specifically, a comparison with the control experiment reveals the formation of 1,4-dihydronaphthalene, naphthalene, and 1-, 2-methylnaphthalene in the composition. In addition, tetralin is not completely converted under these conditions and partially remains in the extract, also acting as a diluent, which can facilitate easier transportation of the extracted oil. The utilization of tetralin during hydrothermal treatment of kerogen-containing Domanik rock leads to several notable outcomes. Firstly, there is an increase in the yield of hydrocarbon gases. Additionally, the yield of oil extract rises, marked by more than a two-fold increase in the content of saturated hydrocarbons. Furthermore, there is a notable reduction in the content of resins by 1.5 times and a three-fold decrease in benzothiophenes within the aromatic fraction. Moreover, the presence of dibenzothiophenes is not detected, and the extract exhibits the lowest total sulfur content compared to all conducted experiments.

To the Editor: Delirium is a common postoperative complication associated with multiple adverse clinical outcomes in older patients.[1] According to the time of onset, delirium in the postoperative stage can be divided into emergence delirium (ED) and postoperative delirium (POD). ED occurs during or immediately after awakening from general anesthesia, whereas POD is usually found during postoperative days 1–7. Assessing patients for ED provides the first clue of a possible postoperative neurocognitive disorder.[2] Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is a highly selective α-2 receptor agonist that is increasingly used in the perioperative period to induce sedation, analgesia, anxiolysis, and sympathetic tone suppression. Previous studies suggested that DEX may be an effective intraoperative adjuvant drug, which can reduce agitation and improve recovery after orthopedic surgery in older patients.[3,4] However, few studies focused on the relationships between DEX and ED. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to explore the relationships between intraoperative DEX administration and the incidence of ED in older patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery, and examine the effects of DEX on the electroencephalogram (EEG) trajectories of older patients during the emergence period and its correlation with ED occurrence. We analyzed 240 older patients who aged ≥60 years (DEX-group, n = 120; saline [SA] group, n = 120). The confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit and the Richmond Agitation and Sedation scale were used to evaluate the occurrence of delirium during emergence. We also recorded and analyzed EEG trajectories during awakening, compared the differences in emergence trajectories between the two groups, and explored possible mechanisms. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University (No. PJ2021-14-16). The trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100053491, Date of registration: November 22, 2021). Written informed consent were obtained from all the participants or their legal representatives. The inclusion criteria were as follows: aged ≥60 years, body mass index (BMI) 18–30 kg/m2, older patients scheduled to undergo lower extremity orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia combined with nerve block anesthesia. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) refused to participate in the study; (2) diagnosed with a psychiatric disease; (3) preoperative cognitive impairment (defined as Mini-CogTM score ≤2), language barrier, or inability to communicate; (4) preoperative history of chronic pain or opioid abuse; (5) oral intake of levodopa, donepezil hydrochloride, and antidepressants; or history of stroke or brain tumor; and (6) inability to complete the neuropsychological tests. DEX or SA were diluted in 0.9% saline up to a volume of 50 mL in identical syringes yielding a concentration of DEX of 1 µg/mL. Each group of patients received DEX or saline 0.4 mL/kg loading volume (pumped within 15 min), etomidate 0.2 mg/kg, sufentanil 0.4–0.5 μg/kg, and cis-atracurium 0.15–0.20 mg/kg for anesthesia induction. After the patients lost consciousness and the muscle relaxation was satisfactory, a laryngeal mask was placed. Tidal volume (6–8 mL/kg) and inspiratory ratio (1:2) were set to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide at 35–45 mmHg. Combined with a lower extremity nerve block, DEX or saline 0.3 mL·kg−1·h−1, remifentanil 0.1–0.3 μg·kg−1·min−1, and propofol 4–6 mg·kg−1·h−1 were used to maintain the depth of anesthesia (anesthesia index [Ai]) at 40–60 in each group. DEX and SA stopped 20 min before the end of the surgery. At the end of the operation, the patients were transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) after spontaneous breathing was restored. The patients received the standard emergence program after stopping the anesthetic drugs to minimize external stimuli (such as noise and oral sputum suction) during the emergence period. EEG data for the whole emergence period (from the cessation of intravenous anesthetics to PACU discharge) were extracted and analyzed. For each patient, the EEG spectrograms were computed using the multi-taper method implemented in Chronux toolbox. The time-series plots of α (8–12 Hz) and δ (1–4 Hz) peak power were extracted from the EEG spectrogram. Then, the hypnograms depicting changes in these states over time were evaluated to determine emergence trajectories. Hypnograms were drawn using three types of anesthesia: non-slow-wave anesthesia (nSWA), δ-dominant slow-wave anesthesia (ddSWA), and α-dominant slow-wave anesthesia (adSWA). nSWA was defined as both δ and α power ≤7 dB; otherwise, δ or α power >7 dB, and ddSWA and adSWA were defined as δ power >α power and δ power ≤α wave power, respectively. Spectrograms with corresponding hypnotic maps were visually assessed by the observer. Patients must remain in a specific state (such as ddSWA, adSWA, or nSWA) for at least 60 s to be included in the appropriate trajectory category: (1) ddSWA to adSWA to nSWA to wake, (2) ddSWA to nSWA to wake, (3) adSWA to nSWA to wake, (4) ddSWA to adSWA to wake, (5) ddSWA to wake, (6) adSWA to wake, and (7) nSWA to wake [Supplementary Figure 1, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C58].[5] Continuous variables were compared using the unpaired two-tailed t-test or the Mann–Whitney test, and categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Correlation between ED and POD was performed as a post hoc exploratory analysis based on a univariable logistic regression model. P <0.05 was statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). A total of 260 participants were randomly allocated to the group [Supplementary Figure 2, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C58]. No statistically significant differences in the basic characteristic data, surgery type, and duration of surgery or anesthesia were found between the two groups [Supplementary Table 1, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C58]. Intraoperative data (including anesthetic or vasoactive drug use) did not differ significantly between the two groups [Supplementary Table 2, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C58]. According to the modified intention-to-treat analysis (n = 246), ED occurred in 23.39% (29/124) of cases in the DEX group and in 36.07% (44/122) of cases in the SA group (P = 0.030). According to the per-protocol analysis (n = 240), the DEX group had a lower incidence of ED than the SA group (24.17% [29/120] vs. 36.67% [44/120], P = 0.035) [Supplementary Table 3, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C58]. Despite the lack of difference in the patterns of emergence trajectory between the two groups (P = 0.173), more patients in the SA group experienced a similarly sudden transition from the slow-wave sleep (include emergence trajectories ddSWA to [adSWA], ddSWA, or adSWA) directly to wakefulness (P = 0.033) [Supplementary Table 4, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C58]. Postoperative plasma concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, and C-reactive protein increased significantly in both groups although the incremental change was significantly smaller in the DEX group (P <0.001) [Supplementary Figure 3, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C58]. Exploratory analysis showed a significant correlation between ED and POD (odds ratio [OR]: 8.60, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.75–19.72, P <0.001). Our results suggested that intraoperative use of DEX in older patients who underwent joint replacement (including knee and hip) reduced the incidence of ED but did not reduce the incidence of POD during the first 3 days after surgery. These results may support the adjuvant use of DEX for smooth emergence from anesthesia and further evaluation of the potential of DEX to reduce long-term cognitive dysfunction in older patients.[6] DEX reduced the levels of inflammatory factors after surgery. However, few patients in the DEX group experienced a similarly sudden transition from slow-wave anesthesia (include emergence trajectories ddSWA to adSWA, ddSWA, or adSWA) directly to wakefulness. The occurrence of ED was independently associated with an increased risk of developing POD. The possible mechanism by which DEX reduces ED in elderly patients is related to the reduction of perioperative inflammatory response in the DEX group and its effect on the emergence trajectory of EEG during the recovery period. The emergence trajectory of an abrupt transition from SWA to wakefulness can be compared to arousal during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. It was demonstrated to be often associated with parasomnias or sleep disturbances resulting from fragmented sleep.[7] Consistent with the common characteristics between sleep and anesthesia, the transition from deep sleep to wakefulness can also be observed in some NREM sleep abnormalities, such as, night terrors or sleepwalking.[8] In our research, more subjects of control group emerging from general anesthesia were observed to move progressively from SWA to awake [38 (50.7%) vs. 27 (33.8%)].The patients who spent emergence time less in nSWA were more likely to have severe pain, and express a degree of agitation in recovery.[9] The "non-preferred" type of emergence trajectory in which the brain transitions directly from SWA to waking status, as compared with the sleepness status, would characterize as a parasomnic or less desirable trajectory and re-establish conscious awareness.[10] This may be one of the explanations for a larger number of patients with ED in the control group during postoperative recovery. Whether effective measures to prevent ED can reduce POD and improve perioperative outcomes remains to be further validated by more high-quality RCT studies in the future.Our observations could help anesthesiologists identify patients at ED risks before the patients fully emerge from general anesthesia. Intraoperative EEG monitoring can provide a method to predict and prevent delirium in PACU, thereby improving postoperative prognosis. To summarize, further researches on the delirium interventions of the patients with delirium-related EEG patterns need to be explored.
