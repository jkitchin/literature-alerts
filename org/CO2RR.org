Background: The implementation of education in tertiary institutions contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), which causes the greenhouse effect and global warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) identifies transportation, energy supply, and industry as the primary sectors driving CO2 emissions over the past 30 years. However, the COVID-19 pandemic unexpectedly reduced CO2 emissions globally by up to 70% due to restricted activities. In 2020, the pandemic led countries, including Indonesia, to enforce Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB) to curb virus spread, which significantly limited community mobility and vehicle use. Climate change, driven by greenhouse gas emissions, is a critical development challenge for Indonesia. Method: The study uses various calculation methods from journals and websites, incorporating expert opinions and the IPCC's method, to analyze emission reductions. Findings: The findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdowns reduced CO2 emissions due to decreased fuel consumption and mobility. Conclusion: This period highlights opportunities for strategies like low-carbon development to continue reducing emissions from vehicles. Novelty/Originality of this Study: This study provides a novel contribution by quantitatively assessing CO2 emission reductions during the COVID-19 lockdown, emphasizing the unique context of an unprecedented global event. It conducts a comprehensive literature review to integrate various CO2 calculation methods, particularly highlighting the sophisticated IPCC method, and offers a comparative analysis of emission reduction techniques.

The use of renewable solar energy for the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has garnered significant interest owing to its dual benefits: reducing the greenhouse effect and producing high-energy alternatives to fossil fuels. Transition metals play a crucial role in catalyzing the CO2RR; however, their scarcity and high cost pose significant challenges in achieving sustainable chemistry. In this study, we developed a metal-free CO2RR catalytic system using triazolium, a small and structurally simple compound, as the key catalyst. Visible-light irradiation of a solution containing a carbazole photosensitizer and triazolium salt under 1 atm pressure of CO2 afforded formate in high yield at room temperature. No other reduced products of CO2 or by-products such as methanol, formaldehyde, oxalate, CO, or H2 were detected. The turnover number of the catalyst exceeded 2300, indicating high catalytic activity and durability. Mechanistic studies revealed that the triazolium salt serves as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst, with a carbon-centered radical as the catalytically active species. A study on the relationship between the chemical structure and catalytic activity of various triazolium analogs elucidated the essential structural properties required for carbon-centered HAT catalysts. The results of this study provide valuable insights for future research on CO2RR utilizing transition-metal-free organic molecules as catalysts, which could significantly contribute to environmentally friendly and sustainable methods.

Tin (Sn)-based materials are expected to realize efficient CO2 electroreduction into formate. Herein, we constructed a heterojunction by depositing Cu on Cu-doped SnS2 nanosheets. During the electrochemical reaction, this heterojunction evolves to a highly active phase of Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 while maintaining its two-dimensional morphology. Specifically, a partial current density of 35 mA cm-2 with an impressive faradaic efficiency of 93% for formate production was achieved over the evolved heterojunction. In situ and ex situ experiments elucidated the formation mechanism of the Cu2O@Cu6Sn5 heterojunction. Cu6Sn5 nanosheets were formed via a stepwise desulfurization process, while Cu2O was generated through its reaction with hydroxyl radicals. This evolved heterojunction with a high electrochemically active surface area synergistically stabilized the *OCHO intermediate, thereby significantly enhancing the selectivity and activity. Our findings provide insight into the structural evolution process and guide the development of selective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

The development of artificial photocatalysts to convert CO2 into renewable fuels and H2O into O2 is a complex and crucial task in the field of photosynthesis research. The current challenge is to enhance photogenerated charge separation, as well as to increase the oxidation capability of materials. Herein, a molecular junction‐type porphyrin‐based crystalline photocatalyst (Ni‐TCPP‐TPyP) was successfully self‐assembled by incorporating a nickel porphyrin complex as a reduction site and pyridyl porphyrin as an oxidation site via hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking interactions. The resulting material has a highly crystalline structure, and the formation of inherent molecular junctions can accelerate photogenerated charge separation and transport. Thus, Ni‐TCPP‐TPyP achieved an excellent CO production rate of 309.3 μmol g‐1 h‐1 (selectivity, ~100%) without the use of any sacrificial agents, which is more than ten times greater than that of single‐component photocatalyst (Ni‐TCPP) and greater than that of the most organic photocatalysts. The structure‐function relationship was investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Our work provides new insight for designing efficient artificial photocatalysts, paving the way for the development of clean and renewable fuels through the conversion of CO2 using solar energy.

The development of artificial photocatalysts to convert CO2 into renewable fuels and H2O into O2 is a complex and crucial task in the field of photosynthesis research. The current challenge is to enhance photogenerated charge separation, as well as to increase the oxidation capability of materials. Herein, a molecular junction‐type porphyrin‐based crystalline photocatalyst (Ni‐TCPP‐TPyP) was successfully self‐assembled by incorporating a nickel porphyrin complex as a reduction site and pyridyl porphyrin as an oxidation site via hydrogen bonding and π–π stacking interactions. The resulting material has a highly crystalline structure, and the formation of inherent molecular junctions can accelerate photogenerated charge separation and transport. Thus, Ni‐TCPP‐TPyP achieved an excellent CO production rate of 309.3 μmol g‐1 h‐1 (selectivity, ~100%) without the use of any sacrificial agents, which is more than ten times greater than that of single‐component photocatalyst (Ni‐TCPP) and greater than that of the most organic photocatalysts. The structure‐function relationship was investigated by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Our work provides new insight for designing efficient artificial photocatalysts, paving the way for the development of clean and renewable fuels through the conversion of CO2 using solar energy.

Product selectivity of solar‐driven CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions has been successfully controlled by tuning the spatial distance between Pt/Au bimetallic active sites on different crystal facets of CeO2 catalysts. The replacement depth of Ce atoms by monatomic Pt determines the distance between bimetallic sites, while Au clusters are deposited on the surface. This space configuration creates a favourable microenvironment for the migration of active hydrogen species (*H). The *H is generated via the activation of H2O on monatomic Pt sites and migrate towards Au clusters with a strong capacity for CO2 adsorption. Under concentrated solar irradiation, selectivity of the (100) facet towards CO is 100%, and the selectivity of the (110) and (111) facets towards CH4 is 33.5% and 97.6%, respectively. Notably, the CH4 yield on the (111) facet is as high as 369.4 µmol/g/h, and the solar‐to‐chemical energy efficiency of 0.23% is 33.8 times higher than that under non‐concentrated solar irradiation. The impacts of high‐density flux photon and thermal effects on carriers and *H migration at the microscale are comprehensively discussed. This study provides a new avenue for tuning the spatial distance between active sites to achieve optimal product selectivity.

Abstract Coinage metal nanoparticles (NPs) enable plasmonic catalysis by generating hot carriers that drive chemical reactions. Making NPs porous enhances the adsorption of reactant molecules. We present a dewetting and dealloying strategy to fabricate porous gold nanoparticles (Au-Sponge) and compare their CO2 photoreduction activity with respect to the conventional gold nanoisland (Au-Island) morphology. Porous gold nanoparticles exhibit an unusually broad and red-shifted plasmon resonance which is in agreement with the results of finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations. The key insight of this work is that the multi-step reduction of CO2 driven by short-lived hot carriers generated by the d → s interband transition proceeds extremely quickly as evidenced by the generation of methane. A 3.8-fold enhancement in the photocatalytic performance is observed for the Au-Sponge in comparison to the Au-Island. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry measurements confirm the 2.5-fold increase in the surface area and roughness factor of the Au-Sponge sample due to its porous nature. Our results indicate that the product yield is limited by the amount of surface adsorbates i.e. reactant-limited. Isotope-labeled mass spectrometry using 13CO2 was used to confirm that the reaction product (13CH4) originated from CO2 photoreduction. We present the plasmon-mediated photocatalytic transformation of 4-aminothiophenol (PATP) into p,p’-dimercaptoazobenzene (DMAB) using Au-Sponge and Au-Island samples.

DMDc and DMDspc successfully expedite the reconstruction and forecasting of CO2 fluid flow with acceptable accuracy margins, aiding in the rapid optimization of geological CO2 storage forecast and its optimization. DMDc and DMDspc models were trained with weekly, monthly, and yearly ECLIPSE 300 simulation pressure and CO2 saturation fields. The domain of interest is a large scale highly heterogeneous offshore reservoir model with over 100000 cells. Snapshot reconstruction significantly reduced simulation times from several hours to mere minutes. DMDspc reduced the number of DMD modes for pressure without losing accuracy while sometimes even improving accuracy. Two operation cases were considered: 1. CO2 injection, 2. CO2 injection and water production for pressure maintenance. For pressure, DMDspc achieved a slightly higher than DMDc average error by removing several modes. On the other hand, DMDspc showed limited success in reducing modes for CO2 saturation. The forecast performance of DMD models was evaluated using percent change error, mean absolute error, and Pearson R correlation coefficient metrics. Almost all DMD pressure models managed to successfully forecast pressure fields while a smaller number of DMD models managed to forecast CO2 saturation. While forecast errors have a considerable range, especially for saturation, only DMD models with errors below 5% PCE for pressure or 0.01 MAE for saturation were considered acceptable for geological CO2 storage optimization. Optimized CO2 injection and water production amounts were consistent across selected DMD models and all time scales. The DMDspc monitored cells approach, which only reconstructs the monitored during optimization cells, reduced even further optimization time while providing consistent results with the optimization that used full snapshot reconstruction.

Abstract Electrochemical CO 2 reduction (ECR) to value-added products is regarded as a sustainable strategy to mitigate global warming and energy crisis, and designing highly efficient and robust catalysts is essential. In this work, transition metal sulfides (TMS)-decorated CuS microflower-like structures were prepared via the one-pot hydrothermal synthesis method for ECR to CO, and the influence of TMS doping on ECR performance was demonstrated. Characterization of the catalysts was performed using XRD, FESEM-EDS, N 2 physisorption, and XPS, revealing the successful loading of TMS, the formation of microflower-like architectures and the generation of sulfur vacancies. Electrochemical tests demonstrated that doping ZnS, Bi 2 S 3 , CdS and MoS 2 improved the intrinsic CO 2 reduction activity of the CuS catalyst. Particularly, the MoS 2 -CuS composite catalyst with imperfect petal-like structure showed uniform distribution of edge Mo sites, which worked synergistically with the formed grain boundaries (GBs) and undercoordinated S vacancy sites in promoting CO 2 activation, stabilizing * COOH adsorption, facilitating * CO desorption, and lowering the energy barrier of the potential-limiting step for improved CO selectivity. The MoS 2 -CuS catalyst achieved a maximum CO selectivity of 83.2% at –0.6 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a high CO cathodic energetic efficiency of 100%. At this potential, the catalyst maintained stable catalytic activity and CO selectivity during a 333-min electrolysis process. The findings will offer a promising avenue for the development of efficient and stable catalysts for CO production from ECR.

Global warming that has an impact on climate change is mostly influenced by an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) gas in the air. The Objective of the study is to investigate risk control in the Decarbonization program consisting of Carbon Reduction and Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS). The focus of the study area in this research is the Donggi Matindok gas field in Central Sulawesi. The research method is to conduct a risk analysis of the decarbonization program implemented so that it can mitigate the risk of operation failure and safety. The results of the evaluation obtained that the carbon reduction program that has been carried out consists of gas processing innovations, energy efficiency, flaring reduction has a low risk with a reduction of 22% per year from the total CO2 produced. The application of the energy management system or ISO 50001 supports in maintaining energy performance so that energy efficiency can be achieved so that the carbon reduction program can be developed every period. Then for the implementation of the CCUS program has a medium to high risk with significant CO2 reduction potential, which later in this research will review the risk mitigation that needs to be prepared for project completion. CCUS programs that will be carried out are CCU Microalgae and CCS well Injection programs. Well targeted risk mitigation can help ensure that government efforts to support decarbonization programs are effective and successful in the long term.

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage supply chain is recently acknowledged as a crucial method to limit global warming. There is a notable desire to optimize supply chains simultaneously with respect to economic and environmental factors, and the development of a mathematical model integrating the life cycle assessment into source-sink matching is missing in the existing literature. The present work means to fill this gap by using a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming problem. The case study for this research focuses on a real-life scenario in Germany where carbon dioxide is captured from flue gas and transported to be stored or/and used. The total profit and life cycle GHG reduction are maximized. The results show that the profit per unit of sequestered CO2 decreases from 2014 to −€332 as the rate of life cycle GHG reduction increases from −873 to 52 MtCO2eq/year. The findings from the model can provide valuable knowledge that can be utilized in various countries at different levels, such as at regional, state, and national levels. This knowledge can also assist decision-makers in selecting more sustainable solutions when designing carbon capture, utilization, and storage systems.

In the backdrop of escalating global vehicle proliferation and the consequent surge in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, there is a compelling urgency to innovate energy recovery methods during vehicular operations for heightened energy efficiency and substantial environmental emission reductions. This paper discussed a variety of vehicle technologies to address environmental emissions issues and critically evaluates contemporary energy recovery technologies across three core dimensions: automotive thermal energy conversion, electronic turbine systems (ETC), and kinetic energy recovery systems. By analyzing empirical data encompassing CO2 emission reduction, energy recovery efficiency enhancement, fuel economy improvement, and applicability diversity across vehicle models, the study aims to establish a scientific foundation for continuous vehicular energy efficiency enhancement and emission reduction. This entails a comprehensive investigation of internal combustion engine principles for potential heat energy recovery, juxtaposing conventional and advanced cycles like the Rankine cycle. Moreover, it involves assessing ETC effectiveness in utilizing exhaust energy while acknowledging system complexity and dynamic response challenges. Additionally, the performance disparities of kinetic energy recovery systems like regenerative braking and exhaust energy recovery in distinct operational contexts are examined. By meticulously comparing experimental data, the paper intends to provide a comprehensive assessment of each technologys merits and drawbacks in advancing energy efficiency and emission reduction, try to pick one or more combinations to minimise the impact, thereby guiding future research and application in automotive energy recovery, and contributing to sustainable automotive engineering technology advancement.

The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) is one of the most promising ways to valorise CO2 as a source of carbon. The development of novel, efficient and scalable catalysts for CO2 electroreduction within electrolysers is still a big challenge. Here, we report the preparation of sustainable, efficient and stable gas diffusion electrodes utilizing Ag as catalyst for the CO2 electroreduction to CO. These cathodic materials are prepared by sputter deposition and subjected to post-deposition modification using dry, reactive processes. The catalyst is uniformly deposited as a thin layer on the porous structure of PTFE minimizing the amount of Ag required. This approach allows for fine tuning of the morphology, chemical composition and loading of Ag and their impact on the CO2RR. These electrodes have been evaluated for the CO2 electroreduction and for electrocatalytic studies in a flow reactor with gas-fed CO2. The optimized electrodes show high activity, with current densities > 20 mA/cm2 at -1,18 V vs. RHE, and faradaic efficiency for CO > 90 %. The stability was tested over periods up to 24 hours showing a significant impact of the post-deposition modification. Higher porosity, roughness and electrochemical surface area have been achieved after the modification. Noteworthy, our approach allows for outstanding performances using a minimal amount of metal, while using the processing advantages of sputtering as an industrial state-of-the-art, high-throughput, and roll-to-roll compatible technique. Moreover, this route enables the deposition of different metals and alloys of tailored composition for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction beyond CO.

Direct air capture (DAC) systems that capture carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the atmosphere are garnering considerable attention for their potential role as negative emission technologies in achieving net-zero CO2 emission goals. Common DAC technologies are based either on liquid–solvent (L-DAC) or solid–sorbent (S-DAC) to capture CO2. A comprehensive multi-factor comparative economic analysis of the deployment of L-DAC and S-DAC facilities across various United States (U.S.) cities is presented in this paper. The analysis considers the influence of various factors on the favorability of DAC deployment, including local climatic conditions such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentrations; the availability of energy sources to power the DAC system; and costs for the transport and storage of the captured CO2 along with the consideration of the regional market and policy drivers. The deployment analysis in over 70 continental U.S. cities shows that L-DAC and S-DAC complement each other spatially, as their performance and operational costs vary in different climates. L-DAC is more suited to the hot, humid Southeast, while S-DAC is preferrable in the colder, drier Rocky Mountain region. Strategic deployment based on regional conditions and economics is essential for promoting the commercial adoptability of DAC, which is a critical technology to meet the CO2 reduction targets.

The global construction industry, responsible for over 10% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in carbon dioxide (CO2) from energy use, contributes a substantial 38% to global emissions. Unchecked emissions pose a serious risk of hastening climate change impacts. To secure a habitable future, collective responsibility is incumbent upon all construction stakeholders to mitigate the carbon footprint. The prospect of a more sustainable environment lies in proactive emission reduction and the pursuit of net-zero carbon construction. This study investigates the indicators, challenges, and strategies in implementing net-zero carbon construction projects Employing an explorative qualitative approach, twenty project managers and environmental officers were interviewed, and thematic analysis identified management, project attributes, and technology as crucial indicators. Despite increased global awareness, the implementation of net-zero carbon in construction faces significant challenges, including financial constraints, governance issues, management, lack of competency, and limited access to green technologies. Effective strategies necessitate incorporation of governance, knowledge, management, and technology elements. Ultimately, this study enhances understanding of the construction industry by delineating indicators, challenges, and strategies in achieving net-zero carbon construction.

The numerous demanding application of concrete is not readily met with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) alone. To meet up the demand and as well as ensured the green concrete durability, it has becomes necessary to incorporate mineral additions with the best combination of others by-product as replacement to improve the performance without jeopardizing the strength of the concrete. In the construction industry, OPC cement and river sand are used as important building material making it scarce and limited. Whereas, as for the cement is well known as the biggest culprits for emitting carbon dioxide (CO2). Hence, partial replacement of cement becomes a necessity as well as natural sand in concrete by waste material or by-product without compromising the quality of the end product. Partial replacement with Ground Granulated Blast furnace Slag (GGBS), Fly Ash (PFA), Silica Fumes (SILICA) incorporates with 100% of Quarry Dust (QD) as sand replacement. The usage of 100% QD with OPC+PFA+SILICA (Mix 2) produced more durable concrete with good temperature control and better furnishing than with 100% river. In addition to the cost effect benefit, the reduction in depletion of river sand, addressing environment and sustainability issues, it is a valuable contribution in creating a green concrete.

Educational buildings tend to fail in the contagion containment of airborne infectious diseases because of the high number of children, for several hours a day, inside enclosed environments that often have inadequate indoor air quality (IAQ) conditions. This study aimed to assess indoor environmental quality and test the effectiveness of portable air cleaners (PACs) in alleviating airborne particle levels in schools of Central–Southern Spain during the period of reopening after the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. To accomplish this, three sampling campaigns were organized from September to December 2020 to consistently monitor temperature and relative humidity, carbon dioxide, and particulate matter in nineteen classrooms (seven school buildings). Results showed that although the recommendation of maintaining the windows open throughout the day seemed to be effective in promoting, in general, proper ventilation conditions (based on CO2 levels). For the colder campaigns, this practice caused notorious thermal comfort impairment. In addition, a great number of the surveyed classrooms presented levels of PM2.5 and PM10, attributable to outdoor and indoor sources, which exceeded the current WHO guideline values. Moreover, considering the practice of having the windows opened, the installation of 1 unit of PACs per classroom was insufficient to ensure a reduction in particle concentration to safe levels. Importantly, it was also found that children of different ages at different education levels can be exposed to significantly different environmental conditions in their classrooms; thus, the corrective measures to employ in each individual educational setting should reflect the features and needs of the target space/building.

How to decouple economic growth from carbon dioxide emissions and achieve low-carbon transformation of the Chinese economy has become an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Firstly, the Tapio index is used to identify China’s carbon peak status, and then the Technology Choice Index (TCI) and economic complexity are introduced into the comprehensive factor analysis framework for carbon dioxide emissions. Key influencing factors are identified using random forest and ridge regression. On this basis, a novel sparrow search algorithm–long short-term memory (SSA-LSTM) model which has more prediction accuracy compared with past studies is constructed to predict the dynamic evolution trend of carbon dioxide emissions, and in combination with scenario analysis, the path towards the carbon peak is simulated. The following conclusions are obtained: The benchmark scenario peaks in 2031, with a peak of 12.346 billion tons, and the low-carbon scenario peaks in 2030, with a peak of 11.962 billion tons. The extensive scenario peaks in 2037, with a peak of 13.291 billion tons. Under six scenarios, it can be concluded that energy intensity is the key factor in reducing the peak. These research results provide theoretical support for decision-makers to formulate emission reduction policies and adjust the carbon peak path.

Renewable energy development in Indonesia is one of the governmentâ€™s programs to reduce carbon dioxide emission and dependence to fossil fuel. Bioethanol is an alternative energy that can be developed to replace solar fuel. Peat is a source of bio-ethanol which is very potential because of its abundant source in Indonesia. This research investigated the lifecycle of bio-ethanol from peat, resulting in carbon dioxide emission reduction and energy net. Fermentation method was used to produce bio-ethanol from peat. In the fermentation, yeast was used and the fermentation temperature was from 200C to 400C. The products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC). The results showed that at the 10th day, the bioethanol production was the highest. This research also concerns to the side effects of by-products from bioethanol production. The use of by-products may improve the environmental performance and bioethanol energy until 30-70%. This research showed that bioethanol (from peat) development in Indonesia is much better compared to other countries.Â Â Â

Effective management of asphaltene-paraffin-resin deposits in the installations of oil and gas distribution systems, along with corrosion control, is one of the most pressing issues. One of the important issues arising from today’s demand is the development and testing of new multifunctional complex inhibitors and compositions based on them designed to combat asphaltene-resin-paraffin deposits and corrosion under laboratory and mine conditions. This paper reports on the laboratory testing of a new multifunctional composition that inhibits the formation of asphaltene-resin-paraffin deposits and corrosion processes in the oil well-gathering-transportation system. The effect of Difron-4201 depressant additive and ED composition on the freezing temperature of a high-paraffin crude oil sample, the formation of asphaltene-paraffin-resin deposits, and the surface tension coefficient were studied for the first time under laboratory conditions. It was found that, compared to the Difron-4201depressant additive, the ED composition exhibited higher efficiency. Specifically, at an optimal consumption concentration of 900 g/t for the Difron-4201 depressant additive and 700g/t for the composition, the highest efficiency was 190% and 200% respectively for freezing temperature reduction, 89.8% and 96.1% for the formation of asphaltene-paraffin-resin deposition, and 63.3% and 76.6% for surface tension reduction. Furthermore, the effect of the IB-1 inhibitor and the ED composition on the viability of sulfate-reducing bacteria in Postgate-B-nutrient medium along with corrosion rate in aggressive media containing hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and a combination of both were studied. Laboratory experiments determined the optimal consumption rate of the IB-1 inhibitor determined to be 25 mg/l. The corrosion protection effect at the optimal concentration of the inhibitor and the ED composition was 97.1% and 99.2% in hydrogen sulfide medium, 94.6% and 95.4% in carbon dioxide medium, and 93.6% and 94.7% in a combines hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide medium, respectively.

This paper addresses the growing challenges and developments in frequency control within power systems influenced by the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources. It evaluates the advancements and limitations of renewable-based control technologies and explores the critical role of diverse energy storage technologies in providing fast frequency response ancillary services. Through a comprehensive analysis of the global literature, this paper categorises energy storage solutions according to their efficacy in meeting fast frequency response demands and potential for revenue generation. It reveals significant gaps in the current research, which predominantly focuses on battery energy storage systems and microgrid applications, with insufficient attention to grid-scale storage solutions and innovative energy storage technologies. This analysis identifies a lack of detailed technical simulations and hybrid storage models for frequency control, as well as a minimal exploration of the environmental benefits, particularly in terms of carbon dioxide emission reductions, associated with deploying new energy storage technologies in ancillary service markets. The paper concludes by emphasising the urgent need for further research incorporating detailed techno-economic evaluations and the carbon dioxide reduction potential of modular, scalable energy storage technologies, which should be facilitated by advanced network simulation models and comprehensive market analysis to drive future advancements in the field.

Buildings account for 39% of emission worldwide. The study aims to clarify the effects of thermal insulation materials used in West Bank Palestinian buildings, to demonstrate their capacity to reduce emissions and saving cost. Using a variety of records from the Engineers Syndicate and the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, a thorough study of buildings in the West Bank area was carried out to determine the number and area of buildings. Additionally, data from sources of energy was collected for the study years 2018–2021. Following the use of thermal insulation materials to the buildings, computations were then equipped with thermal insulation materials, and calculations to estimate the energy savings and reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. The results show, using insulating materials reduce energy consumption by 27.23% and CO2 emissions significantly. It is anticipated that the cost recovery period for new construction is 0.39 to 1.09 years, and for repaired buildings it is between 4.34 and 7.2 years. Depending on the location and typical temperature of the area. The study recommends working for the widespread use of insulating materials in all new construction and for retrofitting existing structures. These initiatives will support international efforts to reduce emissions and achieve sustainable development goals in addition to improving energy efficiency.

Abstract Alga 1.0, a product containing bromoform, was fed to cattle to evaluate effects on methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and diet digestibility. Twelve non-lactating, non-pregnant Jersey cows (490 ± 19 kg BW) were used in four replicated 3×3 Latin squares with three periods, each consisting of 21 d. Cows were blocked by feed intake (averaged intakes over four weeks prior to trial) and assigned randomly to one of three treatments. Treatments included Alga 1.0 fed at 0, 69, and 103 g/d in a 0.454 kg/d DM top dress daily in a modified distillers grains plus solubles (MDGS) carrier. Diet consisted of 60% dry-rolled corn, 20% corn silage, 15% modified distillers grains, and 5% supplement (DM basis). Headbox-style indirect calorimeters were utilized to evaluate gas production from individual cows with two non-consecutive 23-h collections in each period. Data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS with cow within square as experimental unit and as a random effect, and treatment and period as fixed effects. Linear and quadratic contrasts were used to compare treatments. Feeding Alga 1.0 linearly reduced dry matter intake (DMI, P &lt; 0.01) by 10.1 % for 69 g/d inclusion and 13.3 % for 103 g/d inclusion compared to the control. Nutrient intakes decreased linearly (P &lt; 0.01) due to lower DMI, but nutrient digestibility was not impacted (P ≥ 0.28). Inclusion of Alga 1.0 did not impact gross energy or digestible energy concentration of the diets expressed as Mcal/kg DM (P ≥ 0.22) but did linearly reduce energy intake (Mcal/d; P &lt; 0.01). Feeding Alga 1.0 linearly reduced enteric CH4 emissions measured as g/kg DMI (P &lt; 0.01) by 39 and 64% for 69 g/d and 103 g/d inclusion, respectively. Linear reductions (P &lt; 0.01) of 64 to 65% were also observed in enteric CH4 emissions when expressed per kg of DM or organic matter digested. Respired CO2 as g/d linearly decreased (P = 0.03) for cattle fed Alga 1.0 but did not differ when expressed as g/kg of DMI (P ≥ 0.23). Oxygen consumption (O2) did not differ between treatments for g/d and g/kg DMI (P ≥ 0.19). In conclusion, feeding Alga 1.0 reduced DMI up to 13.3 %, did not impact digestibility, and significantly reduced CH4 emissions up to 63%.

The pursuit of sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030 has become a global imperative, necessitating a comprehensive examination of factors influencing carbon footprints across various sectors. In light of varying levels of sensitivity among the top five tourist countries—France, Spain, the United States, Turkey, and Italy—to renewable energy, tourism, financial development, and sustainable development goals (SDGs), this study addresses the challenge of effectively harnessing these factors to achieve comprehensive carbon emissions reduction and sustainable development objectives. By taking data from 1997 to 2021, novel panel quantile regression analysis is performed to ascertain the long-run impacts in lower, middle, and upper quantiles. It finds that renewable energy investments and eco-friendly tourism practices, supported by financial development initiatives, can substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions in top tourist destinations. These measures are essential for maintaining the concerns of the economy and environmental preservation. Renewable energy and financial development unequivocally lead to decreased carbon emissions in the middle and higher quantiles. Tourism development leads to an escalation in carbon emissions approximately in all the quantiles, i.e., from 0.10 to 0.90. The findings of this study underscore that it is crucial to implement specific measures to encourage the use of renewable energy, environmentally friendly practices in tourism, and sustainable financial initiatives. It will not only effectively reduce carbon emissions in top tourist destinations, but also make progress towards achieving sustainable development goals by 2030.

For often unclear reasons, the survival times of critically buried avalanche victims vary widely from minutes to hours. Individuals can survive and sustain organ function if they can breathe under the snow and maintain sufficient delivery of oxygen and efflux of carbon dioxide. We review the physiological responses of humans to critical avalanche burial, a model which shares similarities and differences with apnoea and accidental hypothermia. Within a few minutes of burial, an avalanche victim is exposed to hypoxaemia and hypercapnia, which have important effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and pose a major threat to the central nervous system. As burial time increases, an avalanche victim also develops hypothermia. Despite progressively reduced metabolism, reduced oxygen and increased carbon dioxide tensions may exacerbate the pathophysiological consequences of hypothermia. Hypercapnia seems to be the main cause of cardiovascular instability, which, in turn, is the major reason for reduced cerebral oxygenation despite reductions in cerebral metabolic activity caused by hypothermia. 'Triple H syndrome' refers to the interaction of hypoxia, hypercapnia and hypothermia in a buried avalanche victim. Future studies should investigate how the respiratory gases entrapped in the porous snow structure influence the physiological responses of buried individuals and how haemoconcentration, blood viscosity and cell deformability affect blood flow and oxygen delivery. Attention should also be devoted to identifying strategies to prolong avalanche survival by either mitigating hypoxia and hypercapnia or reducing core temperature so that neuroprotection occurs before the onset of cerebral hypoxia.

Abstract Existing studies indicate that future global carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) removal (CDR) efforts could largely be concentrated in Asia. However, there is limited understanding of how individual Asian countries and regions will respond to varying and uncertain scales of future CDR concerning their energy-land-water system. We address this gap by modeling various levels of CDR-reliant pathways under climate change ambitions in Asia. We find that high CDR reliance leads to residual fossil fuel and industry emissions of about 8 Gigatonnes CO 2 yr −1 (GtCO 2 yr −1 ) by 2050, compared to less than 1 GtCO 2 yr −1 under moderate-to-low CDR reliance. Moreover, expectations of multi-gigatonne CDR could delay the achievement of domestic net zero CO 2 emissions for several Asian countries and regions, and lead to higher land allocation and fertilizer demand for bioenergy crop cultivation. Here, we show that Asian countries and regions should prioritize emission reduction strategies while capitalizing on the advantages of carbon removal when it is most viable.

In 2002, the German agricultural sector contributed 8.7 % of the total national green house gas emissions. The main sources were animal digestion, manure management and agricultural soils. From the technical point of view, the manure management has the biggest potential of green house gas reduction by using biogas technology. Thereby methane emission from manure, which otherwise had been emitted into the atmosphere, can be recaptured and used to substitute fossil fuels. Regarding the whole output of manure from cattle and swine in Germany, the emission reduction is 56 Mio. t CO2-equivalent. This amount is equivalent to 4.5% of the emissions in 1990/95 for the Kyoto protocol. Regarding the biomass potential which is technically feasible at the moment, the reduction potential growth to 276 Mio. t CO2-equivalent or 22% of emissions. This is 27.5 times more than the reduction commitment of the German industry for EU-emissions trading in the period from 2005-2012.

Purpose: The study aims to provide a nuanced understanding of renewable energy sources' geographical aspects and challenges in reducing emissions and promoting sustainable development. Design/Methodology/Approach: This study adopts a qualitative approach to investigate renewable energy sources in the context of emissions reduction, focusing on geographical aspects and challenges for sustainable development. The methodology is designed to gain in-depth insights and understand the complexities of deploying and utilising renewable energy across different geographical regions. Case studies provide detailed, context-specific insights into the practical implementation and challenges of renewable energy projects. The selection of case studies follows a purposive sampling method to ensure diversity in geographical settings, types of renewable energy, and stages of development. Reviewing project reports, policy documents, and environmental assessments related to each case study. The data was analysed by cross-verifying information from different data sources to enhance the reliability and validity of the findings. Research Limitation/Implications: It justifies the immediate construction of a “green economy” in Ukraine, drawing on theory and the experience of advanced countries. Findings: The diversity of renewable energy sources, geographical influences, technological advancements, policy and regulatory frameworks, and socio-economic impacts influenced their efforts to reduce emissions. Social Implication: The modern global economy faces significant challenges such as energy security, sustainable development of society, and climate change. Practical Implication: The paper identifies directions and outlines paths and mechanisms for accelerated development. Indeed, such a powerful carbon dioxide and methane emissions surge has never been observed. Originality/ Value: Recently, the most pressing issue is the “carbon footprint”, which refers to the total amount of carbon dioxide and methane emissions released into the environment due to human industrial activity. Measures to combat it will soon focus on modernising technologies to facilitate the transition to the sixth technological paradigm and minimise greenhouse gas emissions. Critical technical solutions may involve harnessing the potential of hydrogen energy and immobilising or preventing greenhouse gas formation technologies. As an alternative direction, the authors consider research to solve some issues related to hydrogen production using metals.

Abstract Organohalides are widespread pollutants that pose significant environmental hazards due to their high degree of halogenation and elevated redox potentials, making them resistant to natural attenuation. Traditional bioremediation approaches, primarily relying on bioaugmentation and biostimulation, often fall short of achieving complete detoxification. Furthermore, the emergence of complex halogenated pollutants, such as per‐ and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), further complicates remediation efforts. Therefore, there is a pressing need to reconsider novel approaches for more efficient remediation of these recalcitrant pollutants. This review proposes novel redox‐potential‐mediated hybrid bioprocesses, tailored to the physicochemical properties of pollutants and their environmental contexts, to achieve complete detoxification of organohalides. The possible scenarios for the proposed bioremediation approaches are further discussed. In anaerobic environments, such as sediment and groundwater, microbial reductive dehalogenation coupled with fermentation and methanogenesis can convert organohalides into carbon dioxide and methane. In environments with anaerobic‐aerobic alternation, such as paddy soil and wetlands, a synergistic process involving reduction and oxidation can facilitate the complete mineralization of highly halogenated organic compounds. Future research should focus on in‐depth exploration of microbial consortia, the application of ecological principles‐guided strategies, and the development of bioinspired‐designed techniques. This paper contributes to the academic discourse by proposing innovative remediation strategies tailored to the complexities of organohalide pollution.

The reduction of CO2 is an important method to produce chemicals such as methanol, formic acid, formaldehyde, etc. In general, the reduction of CO2 is carried out at high temperatures and pressures with precious metals as catalysts, which is not favorable for industrial procedures. Thus, it will be very useful if researchers can find cost-effective catalysts for industrial application in CO2 reduction. In this work, commercially available ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was tested as a cheap, non-toxic, and recyclable catalyst to initiate the N-carbonylation reaction of CO2 with amines. After screening various reaction parameters, including temperature, pressure, time, solvent, and reducing agent, the optimal reaction conditions were obtained: 80 °C, 2 MPa, 6 h, 50 mmol% catalyst dosage, 1 mL DMSO, and 1:1 molar ratio of amine to reducing agent. Notably, further studies confirmed that EDTA could also be effective for N-formylation even under ambient conditions (0.1 MPa and room temperature). The suitability of the catalyst for 26 kinds of substrates (including aliphatic amines, aromatic amines, and alicyclic amines) and its reusability were also investigated, with satisfactory results. Scale-up research has been performed effectively with a high conversion of amine (83%) to obtain the mono-formylated product selectively. Finally, the mechanism of the reaction between amine and CO2 has been proposed via control experiments and compared with results in the literature.

Transition metal‐doped ceria (M‐CeO2) catalysts (M = Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) with multiple loadings were experimentally investigated for reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to benchmark the properties that impact catalytic activity of CO2 reduction. Temperature‐programmed desorption (TPD) was conducted to study the CO2 binding strength on doped CeO2 surfaces; the trend of the energy along increasing metal loading agrees with the DFT calculations. Notably, CO2 dissociative adsorption energy and oxygen vacancy (OV) formation energy are key descriptors obtained from both DFT and experiments, which can be used to evaluate catalytic performance. Results show the effectiveness of transition metal doping in enhancing CO2 adsorption and reducibility of the surfaces, with Fe showing particularly promising results, i.e., CO2 conversion higher than 56% at 600 °C and 100% selectivity to CO. Cu exhibits 100% selectivity to CO but low CO2 conversion, while Co and Ni showed notable ability of methanation, particularly at high loadings. This study finds that an effective CeO2 based RWGS catalyst corresponds to OV sites that have low OV formation energies for surface reduction, and moderate CO2 adsorption energies for strong interaction with the surface to promote C‐O bond scission.

Purpose To explore the efficiency and safety of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) laser-assisted sclerectomy surgery (CLASS) in Chinese patients with glaucoma secondary to vitrectomy. Methods This retrospective study consisted of 16 eyes from 16 patients with glaucoma secondary to vitrectomy who underwent CLASS and were followed up for 12 months. Main outcome measures included preoperative and postoperative intraocular pressure, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), number of anti-glaucoma medications, and postoperative surgical success rate and complications. Results The postoperative IOP and number of anti-glaucoma medications used at all follow-up time point were significantly lower than those preoperatively. The difference in BCVA was not significant before and after surgery. The main complicatios were peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS) and scleral reservoir reduction, which were controlled after neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, 2 (12.50%) patients underwent re-operation. The complete and total success rates at 12 months were 68.75% and 87.50%, respectively. Conclusion CLASS is a safe and effective procedure for Chinese patients with glaucoma secondary to vitrectomy. PAS and scleral reservoir reduction is a major contributor to postoperative IOP elevation, and trabecular minimally invasive perforation with the Nd:YAG laser is effective in lowering IOP and increasing scleral cistern volume.

To effectively solve the reverse logistics distribution problem caused by the increasing number of scrapped parts in the automotive market, this study constructs a multi-trip green vehicle routing problem model with time windows by comprehensively considering the coordination between carbon dioxide emissions and cost efficiency. A hybrid adaptive genetic algorithm is proposed to solve this problem, featuring innovative improvements in the nearest neighbor rule based on minimum cost, adaptive strategies, bin packing algorithm based on the transfer-of-state equation, and large-scale neighborhood search. Additionally, to efficiently obtain location data for supplier factory sites in the distribution network, a coordinate extraction method based on image recognition technology is proposed. Finally, the scientific validity of this study is verified based on the actual case data, and the robust optimization ability of the algorithm is verified by numerical calculations of different examples. This research not only enriches the study of green vehicle routing problems but also provides valuable insights for the industry to achieve cost reduction, efficiency enhancement, and sustainable development in reverse logistics.

Anthropogenic methane (CH 4 ) emissions increases from the period 1850–1900 until 2019 are responsible for around 65% as much warming as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) has caused to date, and large reductions in methane emissions are required to limit global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C. However, methane emissions have been increasing rapidly since ~2006. This study shows that emissions are expected to continue to increase over the remainder of the 2020s if no greater action is taken and that increases in atmospheric methane are thus far outpacing projected growth rates. This increase has important implications for reaching net zero CO 2 targets: every 50 Mt CH 4 of the sustained large cuts envisioned under low-warming scenarios that are not realized would eliminate about 150 Gt of the remaining CO 2 budget. Targeted methane reductions are therefore a critical component alongside decarbonization to minimize global warming. We describe additional linkages between methane mitigation options and CO 2 , especially via land use, as well as their respective climate impacts and associated metrics. We explain why a net zero target specifically for methane is neither necessary nor plausible. Analyses show where reductions are most feasible at the national and sectoral levels given limited resources, for example, to meet the Global Methane Pledge target, but they also reveal large uncertainties. Despite these uncertainties, many mitigation costs are clearly low relative to real-world financial instruments and very low compared with methane damage estimates, but legally binding regulations and methane pricing are needed to meet climate goals.

Greenhouse gas emissions from industrial activities have resulted in global warming, threatening the human way of life. Climate modeling is crucial to the effort to combat climate change by determining the potential impacts of anthropogenic emissions and thus identifying where emission reduction efforts should focus. In this study, we hypothesized that various economic sectors, geographic regions, and greenhouse gas species could impact the future global mean surface temperature (GMST) anomaly in ways that deviate from the historical and present norm. We used the Finite Amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model, a reduced complexity climate model, as well as four of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), SSP126, SSP245, SSP370 and SSP585, to test our hypothesis. We determined that the future impact of specific economic sectors, geographic regions, and greenhouse gas species deviates from their historical impact. We found that Asia and Africa will contribute to a greater share of the GMST anomaly in the future. We also determined that the warming from most of the greenhouse gas species, excluding carbon dioxide, is highest under the SSP370 scenario (the climate scenario that emphasizes regional rivalries related to climate policy). We concluded that the industrial sector would become more important under the SSPs that represent a lower degree of warming. This research augments the SSPs by considering specific variables not represented in the general SSP scenarios, determining the precise climate impacts of said variables. Additionally, this research helps to determine what emission reduction strategies can most efficiently reduce the GMST anomaly.

The decarbonisation of the industrial sector is required to achieve the objectives defined within the European Climate and Energy framework, since industry accounts for 37% of the total global energy consumption and for a quarter of global energy system CO2 emissions [1]. In this context, this work aims the decarbonisation of a sea-buckthorn processing plant using structural and operational optimisation for the analysis of proposed energy supply concepts based on the integration of renewable energy sources, energy conversion components and storage systems. Different configurations are evaluated to select the concept that leads to a minimisation of the operating costs and a CO2 emissions reduction of the industrial site with installation costs within the investment range defined and the minimum payback period. Thus, the selected decarbonisation concept is able to achieve a reduction of 25% in operation costs (OPEX) and 31% in CO2 with an investment (CAPEX) of 288.7 T€ and a payback time of 5.8 years. Additionally, the developed methodology can be used for the analysis of decarbonisation concepts for other industrial processes by the integration of an adapted techno- economic definition of the components for each energy concept proposed.

Abstract The increasing impact of industrialization on climate change, primarily due to the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), underscores the urgent need for effective strategies for CO 2 fixation and utilization. Electrochemical CO 2 reduction holds promise in this regard, owing to its scalability, energy efficiency, selectivity, and operability under ambient conditions. However, the activation of CO 2 requires suitable electrocatalysts to lower energy barriers. Various electrocatalysts, including metal‐based systems and conducting polymers like polyaniline (PANi), have been identified to effectively lower this barrier and enhance CO 2 reduction efficiency via synergistic mechanisms. PANi is particularly notable for its versatile interaction with CO 2 , cost‐effectiveness, stability, and tunable properties, making it an excellent catalyst option for CO 2 reduction reactions (CO 2 RR). Recent advancements in research focus on enhancing PANi conductivity and facilitating electron transfer through metal and metal oxide doping. Leveraging PANi's π–π electron stabilization ensures high conductivity and stability, rendering it suitable for real‐time applications. Strategic dopant selection and optimization of Lewis acid‐base interactions are crucial for selective CO 2 ‐to‐hydrocarbon conversion. Tailored electrode modifications, especially metal/metal oxide‐loaded PANi electrodes, outperform conventional approaches, underscoring the importance of catalyst design in advancing CO 2 electroreduction technologies. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the systematic methodology involved in preparing PANi‐modified electrodes and explores the enhancements achieved through the incorporation of metals and metal oxides onto PANi‐modified electrodes. It highlights the superior efficiency and selectivity of CO 2 RR facilitated by these modified electrodes through profound synergistic approach compared to conventional metal electrodes such as platinum.

Abstract: The Carbon concentration in earth is closed system, therefore, the contain of carbon in each elements are different. The concentration of CO2 in atmosphere is lower compared with N2 and O2 gas but CO2 concentration is great effect to the atmosphere temperature, it may cause the global warming and climate change. The CO2 concentration in atmosphere should be maintained to slower increase in order to reduce the effect of CO2 in atmosphere. Balancing of carbon positive and negative is concerned to maintain the CO2 concentration in atmosphere. Bio-chars are materials carbon that can be used as soil amendment to increase crop production. Recently, the carbon positive more than the carbon negative, resulted the CO2 concentration in atmosphere was increased gradually. Biochar has been possibility to produce in a large quantity to utilize of waste biomass. We needs a large quantity of biochar to be produced and mixed with soil and store in the ground as carbon sequestration, those biochar increase the soil fertility. Scenarios stabilization wedge represents an activity that starts at zero reduction of emissions in 2005 and increase linearly until it accounts for 1 GtC/ year or 1 wedges reduced carbon emissions in the year 2055.

Abstract Lithium carbon dioxide (Li–CO 2 ) batteries, noted for their high discharge voltage of approximately 2.8 V and substantial theoretical specific energy of 1876 Wh kg −1 , represent a promising avenue for new energy sources and CO 2 emission reduction. However, the practical application of these batteries faces significant hurdles, particularly at high current densities and over extended cycle lives, due to their complex reaction mechanisms and slow kinetics. This paper delves into the recent advancements in cathode catalysts for Li–CO 2 batteries, with a specific focus on the designing philosophy from composition, geometry, and homogeneity of the catalysts to the proper test conditions and real‐world application. It surveys the possible catalytic mechanisms, giving readers a brief introduction of how the energy is stored and released as well as the critical exploration of the relationship between material properties and performances. Specifically, optimization and standardization of test conditions for Li–CO 2 battery research is highlighted to enhance data comparability, which is also critical to facilitate the practical application of Li–CO 2 batteries. This review aims to bring up inspiration from previous work to advance the design of more effective and sustainable cathode catalysts, tailored to meet the practical demands of Li–CO 2 batteries.

The major challenge in the current context of the rising world energy demand is to limit the global temperature increase for mitigating climate change. This goal requires a large reduction of CO2 emissions, mainly produced by power generation and industrial processes using fossil fuels. In this study, a novel methodology for K2CO3-doped Li4SiO4 sorbents production for CO2 capture at high temperatures was adopted based on the Design of Experiments (DoE). This innovative approach systematically tested different synthesis (temperature and K2CO3 content) and adsorption conditions (sorption temperature and CO2 concentration), allowing for the assessment of individual and interactive effects of process parameters. The Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was employed to obtain non-linear predictive models of CO2 uptake and Li4SiO4 conversion. The results of RSM analysis evidenced a maximum adsorption capacity of 196.4 mg/g for a sorbent produced at 600 °C and with 36.9 wt% of K2CO3, tested at 500 °C and 4 vol% of CO2. Whereas at 50 vol% of CO2, the best uptake of 295.6 mg/g was obtained with a sorbent synthesized at 600 °C, containing less K2CO3 (17.1 wt%) and tested at a higher temperature (662 °C). These findings demonstrate that K2CO3-doped Li4SiO4 sorbents can be tailored to maximize CO2 capture under various operating conditions, making them suitable for use in industrial processes.

Adding Ni nanoparticles (NPs) is an effective methodology to improve the catalytic activity of Ni single-atom catalysts (SACs) in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the effect of the form in which the Ni NPs exist on the Ni SAs needs further exploration. Herein, the interaction between Ni NPs in different forms of existence and Ni SAs is investigated on g-C3N4-inducing carbon nanosheets. Comparing with the impregnated Ni NPs, the in situ-doped Ni NPs are encapsulated by a graphitic carbon layer to avoid catalyzing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and facilitate the adsorption of CO2. Meanwhile, the graphitic carbon layer boosts the catalytic stability of Ni SAs that are recognized as the active sites. As a result, the maximal FECO reaches 98.1% at −0.83 V (vs RHE). The large amount of Ni SAs increases jCO to 27.5 mA cm–2 at −1.13 V (vs RHE). A density functional theory (DFT) simulation confirms that the graphitic carbon layer covering the Ni NPs can reduce the energy barrier of the CO2RR to increase the selectivity on Ni–N4 sites. The clarification of the reaction mechanism for the graphitic carbon layer induced by Ni NPs paves a new path for the rational design of Ni SA-dominated catalysts for highly efficient CO2 reduction.

The proliferation of human-AI ecosystems involving human interaction with algorithms, such as assistants and recommenders, raises concerns about large-scale social behaviour. Despite evidence of such phenomena across several contexts, the collective impact of GPS navigation services remains unclear: while beneficial to the user, they can also cause chaos if too many vehicles are driven through the same few roads. Our study employs a simulation framework to assess navigation services' influence on road network usage and CO2 emissions. The results demonstrate a universal pattern of amplified conformity: increasing adoption rates of navigation services cause a reduction of route diversity of mobile travellers and increased concentration of traffic and emissions on fewer roads, thus exacerbating an unequal distribution of negative externalities on selected neighbourhoods. Although navigation services recommendations can help reduce CO2 emissions when their adoption rate is low, these benefits diminish or even disappear when the adoption rate is high and exceeds a certain city- and service-dependent threshold. We summarize these discoveries in a non-linear function that connects the marginal increase of conformity with the marginal reduction in CO2 emissions. Our simulation approach addresses the challenges posed by the complexity of transportation systems and the lack of data and algorithmic transparency.

Molecular catalysts offer a unique opportunity to implement different chemical functionalities to steer the efficiency and selectivity for the CO2 reduction for instance. Metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines are under high scrutiny since their most classic derivatives the tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and parent phthalocyanine (Pc), have been used as the molecular platform to install, hydrogen bonds donnors, proton relays, cationic fragments, incorporation in MOFs and COFs, to enhance the catalytic power of these catalysts. Herein, we examine the electrocatalytic properties of the tetramethyl cobalt (II) tetrapyridinoporphyrazine (CoTmTPyPz) for the reduction of CO2 in heterogeneous medium when adsorbed on carbon nanotubes (CNT) at a carbon paper (CP) electrode. Unlike reported electrocatalysis with cobalt based phthalocyanine where CO was advocated as the two electron and two protons reduced intermediate on the way to the formation of methanol, we found here that CoTmTPyPz does not reduce CO to methanol. Henceforth, ruling out a mechanistic pathway where CO is a reaction intermediate.

Abstract This study focuses on the development and improvement of a new combined power and cooling system called the power-cooling cogeneration system (PCCS). The PCCS incorporates a tri-tier waste heat recovery system that includes an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) system and an ejector-driven refrigeration mechanism. The cogeneration system design incorporates a thorough assessment of thermodynamic efficiency, cost-efficiency, and environmental consequences. A dual-objective optimization technique is developed to decrease expenses while simultaneously improving exergy efficiency. In addition, the complex behavior of PCCS is compared to a standard system that uses a one-stage recovery-ORC system and a compressor-based refrigeration approach. Also, the effectiveness of the PCCS was evaluated through the utilization of several environmentally friendly refrigerants. Environmental evaluations employ two metrics: total equivalent-warming impact (TE-WI) and life cycle-climate performance (LC-CP), emphasizing substantial reductions in environmental harm through improved waste heat recovery. The results demonstrate that the R1234-yf refrigerant achieves the best possible performance in both configurations, resulting in a significant increase of roughly 10.1% in exergetic efficiency compared to the standard system. Simultaneously, the PCCS experiences a decrease in exergy loss and annual costs of around 7.25% and 21.16%, respectively, as compared to the baseline. Incorporating an ejector into the refrigeration cycle has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 11.41 × 106 kg.

Residential energy usage in Charlottesville, Virginia, accounts for nearly 30% of the city’s greenhouse gas emissions. Without significant changes, Charlottesville is unlikely to meet its goal of reducing emissions by 45% by 2030. Improving residential energy efficiency is key to lowering emissions and reducing energy costs for residents. However, the high upfront cost of these upgrades is unaffordable for over a third of Charlottesville households. As electricity prices rise due to Virginia’s upcoming carbon dioxide cap-and-trade program, low-income households that can’t afford efficiency upgrades will face higher energy bills and greater financial strain. This study explores the feasibility of a residential efficiency financing program designed to improve the affordability and accessibility of energy upgrades for low-income households in Charlottesville. Through a detailed benefit-cost analysis, various policy alternatives, including On-Bill Financing, Revolving Loan Fund, and Loan Loss Reserve, were evaluated for their effectiveness, equity, and implementation feasibility. The recommended option, On-Bill Financing, would allow Charlottesville Gas to cover the upfront costs of energy efficiency upgrades. Customers would repay the investment over time through their gas bills, thereby enjoying immediate reductions in energy consumption and costs. This policy would fairly enhance residential energy efficiency and provide critical financial assistance to households that otherwise couldn’t afford these upgrades.

Abstract Biting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are of huge veterinary importance, mainly as vectors of pathogens, such as Bluetongue virus . Currently, there are no effective methods to protect animals against biting midges, as insecticides have limited or short‐lived efficacy. Biting midges are attracted to hosts by carbon dioxide and by their body odours, which are mainly produced by skin bacteria. In humans, it has been shown that differences between individuals in attractiveness to mosquitoes is mediated by these skin bacterial volatiles. This opens the possibility to protect individuals from biting insects by supplementing their skin microbiome with probiotics. In this study, we investigated this approach by culturing sheep skin bacteria on various media and assessing their effects against field‐caught Culicoides (overwhelmingly Obsoletus group species) as well as laboratory‐reared Culicoides nubeculosus (Meigen). Aerococcus urinaeequi , Bacillus safensis , Bacillus subtilis , Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus , Micrococcus sp. and Staphylococcus equorum were selected to be tested in a dual‐choice Y‐tube olfactometer, assessing their behavioural effects on biting midges. We revealed an avoidance effect on laboratory‐reared C. nubeculosus when testing B. safensis and B. subtilis . Bacillus safensis and Micrococcus sp. yielded significant repellent potential towards field‐caught Culicoides . These two candidates were subsequently tested in a membrane blood‐feeding assay. When the bacterial species B. safensis was applied to the membrane, a feeding reduction of 83% was observed with field‐caught Culicoides .

This study evaluated the environmental consequences of engine emissions from road and air transport on three commonly traveled routes between Berlin and the cities of Frankfurt, Paris, and Barcelona. The focus was on CO2 emissions due to their significant impact on climate change. By collecting and analyzing comprehensive data on vehicle and aircraft emissions, this study aimed to compare the CO2 output of each transport mode under different passenger load scenarios. The findings indicate that air transport is generally more efficient in terms of CO2 emissions per passenger for longer distances. For instance, the CO2 emissions per passenger ranged from 22.6 kg to 79.8 kg for air transport and from 64.7 kg to 220.8 kg for road transport, demonstrating reductions of approximately 65% to 72%. This study underscores the importance of considering both distance and passenger load when evaluating the environmental impact of different transport modes and highlights the need for a multifaceted approach to reducing transport emissions, including technological innovations, policy interventions, and behavioral changes.

Molecular catalysts offer a unique opportunity to implement different chemical functionalities to steer the efficiency and selectivity for the CO2 reduction for instance. Metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines are under high scrutiny since their most classic derivatives the tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and parent phthalocyanine (Pc), have been used as the molecular platform to install, hydrogen bonds donnors, proton relays, cationic fragments, incorporation in MOFs and COFs, to enhance the catalytic power of these catalysts. Herein, we examine the electrocatalytic properties of the tetramethyl cobalt (II) tetrapyridinoporphyrazine (CoTmTPyPz) for the reduction of CO2 in heterogeneous medium when adsorbed on carbon nanotubes (CNT) at a carbon paper (CP) electrode. Unlike reported electrocatalysis with cobalt based phthalocyanine where CO was advocated as the two electron and two protons reduced intermediate on the way to the formation of methanol, we found here that CoTmTPyPz does not reduce CO to methanol. Henceforth, ruling out a mechanistic pathway where CO is a reaction intermediate.

We developed a tandem, unassisted, solar-driven electrochemical and photothermocatalytic process for the single-pass conversion of CO2 to butene using only simulated solar irradiation as the energetic input. The two-step process involves electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to ethylene followed by ethylene dimerization to butene. We assessed two unassisted electrochemical setups to concentrate ethylene in the CO2R reactor, achieving concentrations up to 5.4 vol.% with 1.8% average solar-to-ethylene conversion and 5.6% average CO2-to-ethylene single-pass conversion under 1-sun illumination. When passed through the photothermocatalytic ethylene oligomerization reactor, we generated 600 ppm of butene under 3-sun illumination. Through analysis of this process, we identified that the presence of H2, CO, and H2O leads to rapid deactivation of the Ni-based ethylene oligomerization catalyst.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) is a promising strategy for converting CO2 into high-value chemical products. However, the synthesis of effective and stable electrocatalysts capable of transforming CO2 into a specified product remains a huge challenge. Herein, we report a template-regulated strategy for the preparation of a Bi2O3-derived nanosheet catalyst with abundant porosity to achieve the expectantly efficient CO2-to-formate conversion. The resultant porous bismuth nanosheet (p-Bi) not only exhibited marked Faradaic efficiency of formate (FEformate), beyond 91% in a broad potential range from −0.75 to −1.1 V in the H-type cell, but also demonstrated an appreciable FEformate of 94% at a high current density of 262 mA cm–2 in the commercially important gas diffusion cell. State-of-the-art X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) and theoretical calculation unraveled the distinct formate production performance of the p-Bi catalyst, which was cocontributed by its smaller size, plentiful porous structure, and stronger Bi–O bond, thus accelerating the absorption of CO2 and promoting the subsequent formation of intermediates. This work provides an avenue to fabricate bismuth-based catalysts with high planar and porous morphologies for a broad portfolio of applications.

Primary recovery techniques of hydrocarbons are insufficient to meet the ever-growing energy demand. This fact encourages researchers to establish tertiary hydrocarbon extraction techniques to increase production and meet the energy demand. The implementation of CO2 flooding has been widely regarded as a highly favourable approach for enhancing the recovery of both light and heavy oil resources. The rate of CO2 injection must be consistent so that viscosity decreases, and medium crude oil mobility is increased in accordance with production requirements. In this research, the compositional simulation model for CO2 flooding has been developed using Eclipse 2010.1 software with Lorentz-Bray-Clark correlation for enhanced oil recovery by reducing viscosity with constant CO2 injection. The compositional reservoir simulated model was executed from January 1, 2027 to January 1, 2050. From January 1, 2027 to January 1, 2048, the oil production rate remained constant. The concentration of CO2 in the oil phase has exhibited a notable increase, rising from 27.25% to 58.658% over the course of the twenty-three-year simulation period. This observation indicates that the oil phase has experienced a greater dissolution of CO2. Consequently, there has been a reduction in the viscosity of the reservoir oil, with a decrease from 0.126 centipoise (cp) to 0.088 cp, representing a 69.84 percent decline. Additionally, there has been an increase in the mobility of the reservoir oil. Furthermore, the enhanced oil recovery technique successfully achieved the recovery of 35.77 million stock tank barrels per day of medium crude oil. Finally, CO2 flooding reduces the amount of CO2 in nature, which is extremely significant from an environmental standpoint.

Microbial valorization of CO2-derived substrates has emerged as a promising approach to address climate change and resource scarcity. Formate, which can be efficiently produced from CO2, shows great potential as a sustainable feedstock for biotechnological production. However, the scope of formate assimilation pathways is restricted by the limited number of natural formate-assimilating enzymes. To overcome this limitation, several new-to-nature routes for formate assimilation based on its reduction to formaldehyde have been proposed, but they suffer from low catalytic efficiencies and cannot yet support bacterial growth. Here, we propose the Serine Shunt as a novel formate reduction route and demonstrate its activity in vivo. In this pathway, formate is attached to glycine to form serine, which is subsequently cleaved into formaldehyde and glycine, thereby effectively converting formate to formaldehyde. Unlike other formate reduction routes, the Serine Shunt mainly utilizes natural reactions with favorable enzyme kinetics, while requiring the same amount of ATP and NAD(P)H as the most efficient new-to-nature route. We implemented the Serine Shunt in engineered E. coli strains using a step-wise approach by dividing the pathway into metabolic modules. After validating the individual module activities, we demonstrated the in vivo activity of the complete Serine Shunt by measuring intracellular formaldehyde production with a GFP sensor and coupling its activity to cell growth. Our results indicate that the Serine Shunt could be applied as a novel formate reduction route in methylotrophic hosts relevant for biotechnology.

The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals using renewable electricity shows significant promise for achieving carbon neutrality and providing alternative energy storage solutions. However, its practical application still faces significant challenges, including high energy consumption, poor selectivity, and limited stability. Here, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer that couples the acidic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at the cathode with alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at the anode. This dual electro‐synthesis cell is implemented by developing Bi nanosheets as cathode catalysts and oxide‐decorated Cu2Se nanoflowers as anode catalysts, enabling high‐efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180% coulombic efficiency and more than 90% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR‐MOR cell also demonstrates long‐term stability exceeding 100 hours of continuous operation, delivers a formate partial current density of 130 mA cm‐2 at a voltage of only 2.1 V, and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system. This study illuminates an innovative electron‐efficiency and energy‐saving techniques for CO2 electrolysis, as well as the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.

&lt;p class=&quot;ABSTRACT&quot;&gt;In order to make correct estimates of energy consumption for heating, reduction of energy consumption, and CO2 emissions by applying energy efficiency measures, it is necessary to know the structure and characteristics of the building stock. The Typology of residential buildings in Bosnia and Herzegovina identified the structure and characteristics of residential building stock through different periods at the level of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This paper analyses the differences between national and city or municipal typology. Conducted analysis for the City Derventa, shows that in the case of single-family houses, the application of national instead of local typology can result in certain deviations in the estimation of energy consumption, savings, and CO2 emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

We introduced a new class of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) with adjustable pore morphology. We fabricated intrinsically conductive polymer‐composite membranes containing carbon filler, enabling a pore structure variation through film casting cum phase separation protocols. We further selectively functionalized specific pore regions of the membranes with Cu by a NaBH4‐facilitated coating strategy. The as‐obtained GDEs can facilitate the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at Cu active sites that are presented inside a defined and electrically conductive pore system. When employing them as free‐standing cathodes in a CO2 flow electrolyzer, we achieved >70% Faradaic efficiencies for CO2RR products at up to 200 mA/cm2. We further demonstrated that deposition of a dense Cu layer on top of the membrane leads to obstruction of the underlying pore openings, inhibiting an excessive wetting of the pore pathways that transport gaseous CO2. However, the presentation of Cu inside the pore system of our novel membrane electrodes increased the C2H4/CO selectivity by a factor of up to 3 compared to Cu presented in the dense layer on top of the membrane. Additionally, we found that gaseous CO2 could still access Cu in macropores after wetting with electrolyte, while CO2RR was completely suppressed in wetted nm‐scale pores.

The determination of magmatic mineralogy based on the oxidation-reduction state of magma by primary inclusion geochemistry of RAMAN equipment has identified Ngoc Tu granitoid blocks in the oxidation state represented by CO2-rich primary inclusions. Redox conditions help explain the specialized chemistry of geochemistry not only at the content level, but also in terms of the geochemical behavior of the elements. This shows that the Ngoc Tu granitoid block is not favorable for the metal potential of Sn, but is favorable for the movement of Mo and W from the magma solution to the ore solution.

The massive CO2 emission has caused frequent occurrence of climate problems, and a typical response to climate change has reached international consensus. Digital finance and green finance, as a subversion of the traditional financial model, have become significant drivers of global carbon emissions reduction efforts. Based on the panel data, this paper profoundly compares the effects of carbon emissions reduction, mechanisms, and heterogeneous results of two forms of finance. Research finds that technology-centered digital finance focuses on suppressing carbon emissions through technological innovation, and the higher the level of regional economic is, the stronger the role of digital finance in suppressing carbon emissions through technological innovation. The concept-centered green finance focuses on carbon emissions reduction through industrial ecologization, and government-led environmental regulation plays a positive regulatory role. Although the paths of affecting carbon emissions are different, there is a natural fit between the two in terms of the essential goal of carbon emissions reduction. Based on the consideration of the differences in geographic location and financial development level, the carbon emission reduction effects of two forms of finance show apparent heterogeneity. Based on the spatial characteristics of digital finance and carbon emissions, this paper further finds that the digital finance’s carbon emission reduction effects have apparent spatial spillovers. These findings provide an essential direction to formulate a reasonable carbon emissions reduction plan and accelerate realizing the “double carbon” goal.

Geological fractures are mechanical breaks in subsurface rock volumes that provide important subsurface flow pathways. However, the presence of fractures can cause unwanted challenges, such as gas leakage through fractured caprocks, which must be addressed. In this study, the dynamics of enzymatically induced carbonate precipitation in rock fractures and their subsequent influence on CO2 leakage were investigated from a pore-scale perspective for the first time. This was achieved through real-time monitoring of the injection of the solution into a rock-microfluidic flow cell using optical and scanning electron microscopy. It was revealed that the main growth dynamics occur during the first three injection cycles, with growth continuing until the fracture aperture is fully closed in the 6th cycle. Based on the flow simulation, a significant reduction of up to 25% in the CO2 conductivity of the original fracture is expected even after the first treatment cycle. Future studies are suggested to explore different resolutions, testing conditions, and to conduct 3-dimensional investigations of the growth dynamics.

Net-zero chemical production can be achieved through electrification, biomass-based processes, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage. However, these net-zero pathways require more resources than business-as-usual processes. One possibility to produce net-zero chemicals at a lower resource consumption is the combination of net-zero pathways based on locally available resources. This study determines the optimal combinations of net-zero pathways for producing chemicals with net-zero emissions that minimize the use of renewable energy, land, and water while complying with local waste biomass and CO2 storage availability. Waste biomass is defined as residue biomass that does not compete for land and water with other sectors. The analysis is performed worldwide at the country level and considers the production of ammonia, methanol, and plastics, which, when combined, account for ∼5% of the global CO2 emissions. Findings show that, when considering net-zero pathways individually, waste biomass is preferably used for producing ammonia and methanol, whereas carbon capture and storage is preferably deployed for plastics production. At the same time, a mixed strategy using carbon capture, utilization, and storage, and waste biomass, allows one to achieve a net-zero chemical industry with a nearly 60% reduction in energy consumption and 90% reduction in land and water consumption, with respect to single-pathway strategies. Finally, we find that adopting a net-zero portfolio that minimizes water allows water consumption to be reduced by more than 90% and land consumption to be reduced by more than 70% at the cost of an energy increase of only 5%, when compared to the minimum-energy portfolio.

Background: Indonesia is still an energy importer, especially in the form of crude oil and fuel products to meet the needs of its industrial sector. The reduced production of fossil energy, especially oil, as well as the global commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, has prompted the Indonesian government to continue to support the role of new and renewable energy. The production of palm oil-based biodiesel is faced with a number of environmental problems, which may occur from the release of emissions during the production of FFB (Fresh Fruit Bunches), CPO (Crude Palm Oil), and biodiesel. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to compile an LCI (Life Cycle Inventory) covering the production of FFB, CPO, and biodiesel; analyze the environmental impact of the CPO bodysel production process which includes CO2 (eq) emissions, acidification and eutrophication; and develop a life cycle concept for biodiesel production from palm oil as a renewable energy. Methods: The method used in this study is a combination of quantitative LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) and AHP (Analytical Hierarchy Process) and qualitative. Findings: The results of this study are LCI in 1 ton of biodiesel consisting of NPK fertilizer of 141.1 Kg; herbicide (0.25 Kg); water (1578 m3), diesel oil (25 Kg); fresh fruit bunches of 5.67 tons; electricity of 33.8 kWh, POME (Palm Oil Mill Effluent) (3,47 m3), CPO needed for biodiesel conversion of 1.17 tons; methanol (0.41 tons), and 0.01 tons of Sodium Hydroxide. The total CO2 emission (eq) of biodiesel production from palm oil is 1489 Kg CO2 (eq), eutrophication is 1.12 Kg PO43- (eq) and acidification is 3.06 Kg SO2 (eq). With the largest contribution of CO2 (eq) emissions in CPO production and the contribution of eutrophication and acidification in oil palm plantations or FFB production (Fresh Fruit Bunches). Environmental hotspot of LCA, CO2 (eq) emissions from palm oil biodiesel production show that 53% mainly comes from POME (Palm Oil Mill Effluent) waste, other contributors are NPK fertilizers (23%), methanol (18%), and diesel oil (7%). Hotspot eutrophication showed that 61% mainly came from NPK fertilizer, methanol (20%), diesel oil (11%), and POME waste (8%). Hotspot acidification showed that 48% mainly came from NPK fertilizers, methanol (28%), POME waste (13%), and diesel oil (11%). Conclusion: The concept of a biodiesel production life cycle can be applied with the best alternative utilization of POME waste with a priority weighting of 0.357 and a CO2(eq) emission criterion of 0.494. From the optimization of the life cycle of biodiesel production with the use of POME, the potential for emission reduction is 667.2 Kg CO2 (eq). Novelty/Originality of this Study: This study's novel application of LCA evaluates the environmental impacts of biodiesel production from palm oil in Indonesia, identifying critical hotspots in CO2 emissions, eutrophication, and acidification. Additionally, it proposes an innovative optimization approach by utilizing POME to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting a viable path for enhancing the sustainability of biodiesel production.

Renewable energy resources have become the best way to solve the issues created by traditional power resources in terms of environmental effects, energy cost reduction, and high-power demand. The hybrid-based system gives a realistic economic solution where grid extension is non-feasible especially for remote areas. The main objective of this study is to determine the optimum size of a hybrid-based system to fulfill the requirements of remote sites located in the Hasik area in the southern part of Oman. The work is carried out using HOMER Pro and MATLAB software. The proposed hybrid system in the Hasik network is a combination of PV systems with existing diesel generation. Real load data as well as solar radiations were utilized in the proposed model. HOMER selected an optimum solution for the hybrid system resulting in a combination of a 2,500 kW PV system and 3,100 kW diesel generation as well as providing a reduction in the cost of energy and CO2 emissions by 13% and 22%, respectively. The optimum PV sizing for the hybrid system was determined using a genetic algorithm tool in MATLAB. The optimization was based on reducing the system power losses, improving the voltage profile, and minimizing cost. Optimization verification was done using load flow analysis by MATLAB to determine the PV sizing effects on the system power losses and voltage profile. Based on the model results, the hybrid system is feasible in the Hasik area.

Regulating both crystallographic orientation and thickness of titanium metal–organic framework (Ti-MOF) membranes remains a significant challenge. In this study, we pioneered the fabrication of uniform 29 nm thick NH2-MIL-125 nanosheet seeds by employing crystallization kinetics modulation approach. Through innovating confined counter-diffusion-assisted epitaxial growth under single-mode microwave heating, a highly c-oriented 80 nm thick NH2-MIL-125 membrane was prepared. Significant reduction in thickness endowed the membrane with unprecedented H2 permeance (1350 GPU) along with considerable H2/CO2 selectivity (19.1), exceeding the performance benchmarks of state-of-the-art NH2-MIL-125 membranes.

Most countries in the world have agreed to reduce their emissions following the COP21 agreement in Paris, and as a result, each nation has presented suitable plans to do so. Chile is not an exception in this regard. This article examines the emissions of Chilean industries using the emission multiplier product matrix (eMPM), a cutting-edge method that estimates the pollution caused by inter-industrial activity in the country’s regions by integrating CO2 emissions with multi-region input–output table (MRIO) databases and elasticities. This approach connects the major emissions-producing sectors to the regions where these emissions come from, thereby accounting for existing interregional linkages. The application of technology, along with adequate state regulation in compliance with Chile’s pledges, acquired following the COP25 call, will decide the level of improvement in emissions reduction.

Controlling carbon emissions is a global goal, and China is actively implementing carbon reduction measures. As a major agricultural nation, China has considerable potential for developing agricultural residues as renewable and environmentally friendly biomass energy. In this study, we obtained data on crop yields, crop-to-grain ratios, and livestock excretion coefficients to calculate the biomass resources of agricultural and livestock residues in Chinese provinces from 2013 to 2022. Crop residue biomass resources showed a distribution pattern with higher levels in the north than in the south and the east than in the west. Henan and Heilongjiang provinces consistently had the highest resource levels, exceeding 35 million tons annually for 10 years. The biomass resources from livestock residues were relatively abundant in Sichuan, Henan, Yunnan, Shandong, Hunan, and Inner Mongolia. Inner Mongolia, Sichuan, Shandong, and Henan had the greatest potential for CO2 emission reductions, primarily located in regions abundant in biomass resources and with high traditional energy consumption levels. ArcGIS was used to apply natural break classification to categorize the potential for emission reductions from agricultural and livestock residues across China from 2013 to 2022 into five classes. Based on factors such as crop planting area and livestock numbers, the spatiotemporal distribution of factors influencing the quantity of biomass resources was examined using Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression. A tailored and integrated approach should be used for biomass, and the development of biomass energy should be promoted through policy support and technological innovation.

Besides outstanding catalytic performance, the stability of nitrogen-doped carbon materials during storage is equally crucial for practical applications. Therefore, we conducted the first investigation into the stability of highly nitrogen-doped activated carbon (AC-NC-T) obtained by modifying activated carbon with CO2/NH3 in different storage media (air, vacuum and N2). The results of the catalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction and the activation of peroxymonosulfate for degrading bisphenol A by AC-NC-T show that the catalytic activity of AC-NC-T stored in air decays most prominently, while the performance attenuated only marginally when stored in vacuum and N2. The results from N2 adsorption isotherms, Raman spectroscopy, elemental and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that the decline in catalytic activity is due to the presence of oxygen in the environment, causing a decrease in absolute contents of pyridinic N (N-6) and graphitic nitrogen (N-Q). After being stored in an air atmosphere for 28 days, the absolute contents of N-6 and N-Q in AC-NC-950 decreased by 19.3% and 12.1%, respectively. However, when stored in a vacuum or N2, the reduction in both was less than 7%. This study demonstrates that reducing oxygen concentration during storage is crucial for preserving high catalytic activity of nitrogen-containing carbon materials.

Abstract It is often observed that some runaway Li-ion cells with layered cathode materials become much hotter internally than existing thermal runaway models predict, Further, metals originally in the positive active material (such as Co, Ni, and Mn) are often found in cells whose temperatures became very high. It has been postulated that the formation of metals can be attributed to reduction of rock salt species (MO, where M is the metal), or the reaction of lithiated active material (LiMO2) with CO2. We propose an alternate process for formation of metals that also results in very high cell temperatures, namely thermite reactions between the Al positive electrode current collector and the positive active material. These reactions are highly exothermic, in contrast with the reactions of MO and LiMO2. In this paper the thermodynamics of thermite reactions are presented. Incorporating thermite reactions in runaway models will likely improve temperature prediction of Li-ion cells in thermal runaway.

Recycling fly ash (FA) and furnace bottom ash (FBA) help with reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving natural resources, and minimizing waste accumulation. However, research on recycling FBA is progressing more slowly compared to FA. This research aims to investigate the combined use of FBA as a replacement for both fine aggregate and cement and its influence on the performance of mortar. The findings indicated that incorporating 25% FBA as a fine aggregate replacement and 10% or 20% ground FBA (GFBA) as a cement replacement significantly enhanced compressive strength after 28 and 56 days. Flexural strength was comparable to control mortar at 28 days and superior at 56 days. However, increasing the FBA content beyond 25% as a fine aggregate replacement reduced workability and increased porosity, which negatively affected mechanical performance and water absorption. Microstructural analyses revealed denser and more compact structures in the mortar with combined FBA replacement for both fine aggregate and cement, specifically 25% as a fine aggregate replacement and 10% and 20% as cement replacements. Optimal performance was noted in mixtures with Ca/Si and Ca/Al ratios within the ranges of 1.8–1.5 and 0.24–0.19, respectively. Trace element leaching analysis has not shown significant differences between GFBA, FA, and OPC. Regarding environmental impact assessment, using FBA as a fine aggregate replacement did not show a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, but replacing cement with FBA reduced emissions remarkably. Generally, using FBA as a replacement for both fine aggregate and cement in mortar enhances compressive and flexural strengths at optimal levels, promotes sustainability by reducing landfill waste and CO2 emissions, and supports cleaner production practices despite some workability challenges.

The electrocatalytic C−N coupling from CO2 and nitrate emerges as one of the solutions for waste upgrading and urea synthesis. In this work, we constructed electron‐deficient Cu sites by the strong metal‐polymer semiconductor interaction, to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis. In situ Raman spectroscopy identified the existence of electron‐deficient Cu sites and was able to withstand electrochemical reduction conditions. Operando synchrotron‐radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations disclosed the vital role of electron‐deficient Cu in adsorption and C−N coupling of oxygen‐containing species. The electron‐deficient Cu displayed a high urea yield rate of 255.0 mmol h−1 g−1 at −1.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode and excellent electrochemical durability, superior than that of non‐electron‐deficient counterpart with conductive carbon material as the support. It can be concluded that the regulation of site electronic structure is more important than the optimization of catalyst conductive properties in the C−N coupling reactions.

Foam can effectively improve reservoir heterogeneity, increase gas–liquid flow rate, reduce viscous fingering, and help to improve sweep efficiency. This paper mainly studies the characteristics and performance of microbial foam production, and proposes an enhanced oil recovery method for profile control by in situ microbial foam production. By optimizing the carbon and nitrogen sources of the medium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 produced single and double rhamnolipids and biogas composed of N2, CO2, and CH4, and it could also produce foam in high salt, weak acid, and weak alkali environments. Gas injection experiments were carried out using self-produced biogas, the foaming effect is good in the range of gas–liquid ratio 1:1–3:1 and gas injection speed 20–40 ml/min, which was 71.43%–91.25% more than the foam volume produced by CO2 injection, and the foam production was positively correlated with the protein concentration of the foam. In the early stage of incubation, the foam was 20–100 μm in diameter, with high protein concentration and strong foam stability, which slowed down the drainage, polymerization, and disproportionation of the liquid film of the foam system. The foam performance test results show that the foam half-lifetime is long, up to 109 min. Foam culture medium has good viscosity reduction effect, emulsifying properties and less corrosive. The displacement experiment shows that the foam generated in situ by PAO1 in the core has good stability, reproducibility, and profile control performance, which can reduce the permeability of the core to half of the initial permeability and improve the reservoir heterogeneity. Therefore, microbial in situ foam production can be an effective method to enhance oil recovery in heterogeneous reservoirs, which is low cost, low pollution, and simple operation.

In order to cope with climate warming, control greenhouse gas emissions and realize the “double carbon” goal, it is necessary for China to improve the carbon emission efficiency of the logistics industry (LCEY). Therefore, in order to realize the emission reduction and efficiency of the logistics industry, this paper measures, evaluates and improves the LCEY in China's Yangtze River Delta region. Firstly, the evaluation index system of the LCEY is constructed from the perspective of inputs and outputs, and the input indexes mainly include the labor population, fixed capital inputs and energy consumption in the logistics industry, and the desired outputs include the output value of the logistics industry, cargo turnover, and the non-desired outputs are the CO2 emissions, which are measured using the Super-SBM model; secondly, the Tobit model is used to analyze the influencing factors of LCEY in the Yangtze River Delta; finally, countermeasure suggestions to improve the LCEY are put forward, the aim is to provide methodological and theoretical underpinnings for the LCEY's management and research, and to provide a basis for the policies formulation.

The electron‐deficient Cu displayed a high urea yield rate of 255.0 mmol h−1 g−1 at −1.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode and excellent electrochemical durability, superior than that of non‐electron‐deficient counterpart with conductive carbon material as the support. It can be concluded that the regulation of site electronic structure is more important than the optimization of catalyst conductive properties in the C−N coupling reactions.

Based on data from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Indonesia has abundant potential for solar power development, even with relatively low irradiation times. The implementation of solar power plants can directly mitigate the negative impact of carbon emissions caused by fossil power plants, especially coal-fired power plants. This study is aimed to calculate the carbon emission reduction from the construction of FPVPP Tembesi Batam and conduct economic analysis of FPVPP construction by considering Net Present Value (NPV), and Payback Period (PBP), and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for PLN Batam located in Tembesi Batam Islands Indonesia. This Tembesi solar power plant will be the largest solar power plant in Batam Island which is intended to replace the role of fossil power plants. The study also analyzes the financial impact of carbon credits and renewable energy certificates that PLN Batam will obtain if it fully implements the Tembesi solar power plant. Based on the results of our study, the total carbon emission reduction due to the use of FPVPP when compared to Batam's electricity carbon emission is 67,278,560-ton CO2 in a year. The use of FPVPP in Tembesi, Batam affects the savings of primary energy payments each year and from the economic analysis using the NPV, PBP, and IRR methods, the results show that the feasibility of investing in the construction of FPVPP in Tembesi, Batam is considered feasible and profitable for PT PLN (Persero), the environment, and the scope of the Indonesian state.

The development of electric vehicles (EVs) presents the challenge of optimising electric machines to enhance efficiency, compactness, noise, vibration, harshness (NVH), and affordability, while reducing the dependence on heavy rare-earth materials to reduce the CO2 footprint of electric powertrains. This paper introduces a comprehensive optimization approach for the electromagnetic design of permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs), employing a combination of Design of Experiment (DoE) and Robust Neural Networks (RNN). The optimization framework is utilised to comprehensively address the multiple objectives of an electric machine, including efficiency, noise, vibration, harshness (NVH), and cost. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven modelling has resulted in significant performance improvements, achieving up to 96% total efficiency over the entire load cycle with substantial NVH reductions of up to 20 dB, while reducing the magnet rare earth materials by 35% compared to the baseline. Furthermore, this methodology reduces the simulation time by up to 90%, demonstrating the potential of combining neural network optimization with conventional finite element simulation techniques. The validation of the AI-driven optimization approach with the measurement of the baseline and optimised electric machines for efficiency and vibration is demonstrated for correlation.

In the context of a global shift towards renewable energies and climate change mitigation, the market for electric vehicles has experienced a remarkable upswing, with battery electric vehicles (BEVs) leading this transformative wave. The appeal of BEVs lies in their ability to significantly curtail CO2 emissions by supplanting the traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) with an electric motor. This pivotal change in vehicular technology extends its influence to various subsystems, including automotive lighting. Headlights are particularly sensitive to the thermal environment they operate in, which can profoundly affect their functionality and durability. The removal of an ICE in BEVs typically results in a reduction in heat exposure to headlight components, prompting a potential reevaluation of their design. This article presents a comprehensive analysis of temperature distributions within headlight units, comparing BEVs and ICE vehicles. The study encompasses a robust dataset of nearly 30,000 vehicles from around the globe, taking into account the impact of ambient temperature on headlight operation. The investigation delineates the distinct thermal behaviors of the two vehicle categories and offers strategic recommendations for conceptual modifications of headlights in BEVs. These adjustments are aimed at enhancing headlight efficacy, prolonging lifespan, and furthering the sustainability objectives of electric mobility.

This book applies a contract-governance theory to the implementation of decarbonisation objectives in the international maritime sector. In doing so, it provides an overview of how the network of contractual relationships that characterise commercial shipping can become effective sites of collaboration between shipping actors to improve upon energy efficiency and CO2 reduction. To achieve this aim, the book investigates and develops a set of contractual tools that can enable private actors to strengthen their commitments to net-zero targets (whether state-mandated or voluntary) and develop cooperative norms to guide decision-making and contractual interpretation. These mechanisms include contractual clauses and drafting considerations which can secure a desired outcome for contractual performance, thereby managing climate risks and providing adequate remedy where such risks materialise. In a transnational sector such as shipping, where contracts can exert greater influence on corporate decarbonisation efforts than international regulation, the book challenges the traditional limitations of contract law and calls for a deeper integration of green principles into private relationships.

Steam displacement is prone to cross-flow, small swept area, large oil–water ratio, large oil–water interfacial tension, and low oil displacement efficiency. Compared with steam flooding, foam flooding can effectively reduce the residual oil in the small throat of the main flow channel and the small hole in the near flow channel and increase the overall recovery factor. Therefore, researchers carried out CO2 and chemical agent-assisted steam displacement. However, at present, there is a lack of research on the occurrence mechanism and model of residual oil. Steam flooding often encounters challenges such as cross-flow, limited sweep area, and high oil–water ratio. Foam flooding offers a promising alternative by effectively reducing residual oil in narrow throats and the near flow channel, thereby enhancing overall recovery rates compared to steam flooding alone. Therefore, chemical agent-assisted steam flooding was applied to enhance heavy oil recovery. However, the occurrence mechanism and model of residual oil after chemical agent-assisted steam is not clear. To fill this gap, the CO2 foam viscosity reducer assisted steam (CFVAS) flooding technology has been adopted and carried out in several studies. First, the foam viscosity reducer was prepared and its foam properties (viscosity reduction effect, foam volume, and half-life) were tested. Subsequently, the CFVAS displacement experiments after steam flooding were carried out, and the flow behavior of the remaining oil in multiple regions (main flow channel, near flow channel, and far flow channel) was analyzed. Finally, the shape and number of remaining oil under different displacement stages were compared, and the occurrence mode of remaining oil under CFVAS displacement was determined. The results indicate the following: (1) During steam flooding, the amount of near flow channel residual oil decreased with injected pore volumes (PV), transforming into columnar structures in small perforations and film-like formations in far flow channels. (2) CFVAS flooding, including the foam stability mechanism, flow channel adjustment mechanism, and emulsification and dispersion mechanism, can improve overall recovery rates by 55.2% by driving the remaining oil in near flow channels. (3) During CFVAS flooding stage, crude oil mobility notably improved and flooding front expanded more evenly. Residual oil primarily existed as oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions with discontinuous columns. (4) In the CFVAS flooding stage, residual oil mainly formed O/W emulsions through emulsification and dispersion, with foam-filled large and medium pores, concentrating residual oil in thick and middle throats. This work can provide important references for injecting CO2 gas into reservoirs to enhance heavy oil recovery and promote carbon sequestration.

A demonstration-scale outdoor constructed wetland (CW) wastewater treatment system was evaluated for about two years for its effectiveness in treating septic system effluents. The system included three treatment cells: an anaerobic cell, an aerated cell, and a basic oxygen furnace slag (BOFS)-based phosphorus (P) treatment cell. High removal efficiencies were achieved, with reductions of >99% for PO4-P, >83% for NH3-N, >99% for cBOD5, and >76% for COD, with influent concentrations averaging 6, 48, 63, and 143 mg L−1, respectively. Additionally, pathogen removal was high, with an over 99% decrease in E. coli and total coliform levels. The BOFS cell was critical, elevating effluent pH to 10.9 ± 1.5, which effectively inactivated pathogens. Environmental safety before discharge was ensured by CO2(g) sparging to adjust the pH and a zero-valent iron layer in the BOFS cell to control dissolved metal concentrations. Analytical techniques (FESEM-EDX, FTIR, and XANES) confirmed the formation of Ca carbonate and Ca phosphate on spent BOFS, highlighting their role in the treatment process. This study highlights the potential of integrating complementary technologies in constructed wetlands for sustainable and efficient wastewater management.

Abstract Anthropogenic gasses are very detrimental, requiring superior sensitive and selective materials to sense and segregate them. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) tools we have explored the sensitivity and selectivity of CO2, CO, NH3, NO2, H2S, and SO2 gases in the promising group-III Janus Ga2SSe and In2SSe nanostructured materials. We have explored all the possible adsorption sites in the Ga2SSe and In2SSe monolayer for sensing the gases and found that all the gasses are physisorbed in the sites with the lowest adsorption energy of -0.392 eV (-0.167 eV) for NH3 (NO2) on top of Indium (on the bridge-3 site) site of In2SSe (Ga2SSe). All adsorbed gasses significantly alter the bandgap of Ga2SSe and In2SSe from their pristine value and NO2-adsorbed M2SSe (M = Ga, In) structure exhibits significant bandgap changes: ~0.16 eV reduction in Ga2SSe and ~0.3 eV reduction in In2SSe from the pristine value, signifying substantial increase in conductivity. Additionally, analyzing the total density of states (TDOS), it can be concluded that NH3 at the Indium site of In2SSe and NO2 at the Bridge-3 site of Ga2SSe exhibit the most significant conductivity changes. Considering charge transfer, it is determined that 0.727 e/Å-3 of charge is transferred from In2SSe to NH3, while 1.05 e/Å-3 of charge is transferred from Ga2SSe to NO2 gas molecules, inferring that both NH3 and NO2 act as electron acceptors. Through this analysis, we found that NH3 is very selective on In2SSe while NO2 is selective on Ga2SSe Janus materials among the control gasses. This selectivity toward NH3 (NO2) gas on In2SSe (Ga2SSe) Janus material can open the new possibility of these materials for noxious gas sensing as well as NO2 utilization applications.&#xD;

Abstract Urbanisation processes contribute to an increase in the level of harmful emissions in cities, which significantly increases the relevance of sustainable inclusive development based on the principles of decarbonisation and the transition to zero-emission cities. The purpose of the study is to summarise the global experience of implementing sustainable urban development programmes and their transition to zero-emission cities and to develop proposals for its implementation in the substantiation of urban development programmes in Ukraine. The study is based on a system of methods that includes conceptual approaches to sustainable inclusive development based on a balanced approach, generalisation of global digital trends in the transition of cities to zero CO2 emissions, practical results of decarbonisation projects and identification of indicators for their achievement. In the context of the formation of “smart” city strategies in Ukraine, the current areas of decarbonisation of urban development, based on the feasibility and limited funding, are optimisation of urban traffic, creation of “green” zones with zero emissions, implementation of a set of measures and introduction of renewable energy, promotion of projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in construction, including their reduction at all stages of the life cycle of buildings, as well as the implementation of a “smart” waste management system Based on a synthesis of international experience, the study outlines the basic indicators for achieving decarbonisation goals, which can be used in the future to substantiate sustainable development strategies for Ukrainian cities.

Hydrogen is a key component for a successful energy transition on a large scale since it boasts a remarkable energy efficiency. Currently, H2 is mainly obtained through steam reforming of natural gas or hydrocarbons and low‐carbon alcohols but contains approximately 2% of CO, a contaminant detrimental to H2 fuel cells. Herein, an N‐doped carbon nanotube was prepared via the soft nitriding method to support nickel and cobalt for the PROX‐CO as the main reaction for hydrogen purification. The most efficient condition was achieved when the reaction temperature reached 250°C and the Ni and Co loading rate was 7.5%. In this situation, the CO2 selectivity reached almost 33% and CO conversion was 61%. Regarding CO conversion among bimetallic catalysts at 250°C a minimal variation occurred and the catalyst 10Ni/N‐CNTs slightly out performed (64.4%). The effect of N‐doping on the carbon nanotube’s structure was also revealed. Nitrogen atoms incorporated into the lattice of carbon nanotubes impart an electron‐donor character. Consequently, Co oxide reduction to the metallic phase occurred at significantly lower temperatures compared to other supports such as SiO2, Al2O3, and graphene. For the bimetallic catalysts, the strong metal‐support interaction facilitated obtaining different oxide and metallic phases at milder temperatures

Reducing children’s exposure to air pollution is a priority among California communities heavily impacted by air pollution exposures. We conducted an observational air quality study at a school to investigate the effectiveness of improved Heating, Ventilation, and Cooling (HVAC) system filters and portable air cleaners (PACs) in reducing children’s exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) under real-world classroom conditions. This study included five classrooms, three of which had PACs. Halfway through the study period, high-efficiency HVAC filters were installed in all five classrooms. Continuous measurements of outdoor and in-classroom PM2.5 concentrations were used to evaluate filtration effectiveness. The air filtration strategies, alone and in combination, demonstrated 14–56% reductions in indoor PM2.5 concentrations compared to outdoor levels. There were significant improvements in filtration resulting from HVAC filter upgrades in the two classrooms without PACs (11% and 22% improvement, p < 0.001). Upgrading HVAC filters in classrooms with PACs did not significantly improve filtration effectiveness, suggesting that utilizing both strategies simultaneously may not meaningfully improve air quality under these circumstances. CO2 data, as a proxy for ventilation, helped demonstrate that the observed filtration effectiveness was likely impacted by the variable HVAC system use and open doors.

Buildings play a significant role in the rise of energy consumption and carbon emissions. Building operations are responsible for 28% of the world’s carbon emissions. It is crucial, therefore, to evaluate the environmental impact of various buildings’ operational phase in order to implement sustainable strategies for the mitigation of their energy usage and associated carbon footprint. While numerous studies have been conducted to determine the carbon footprint of conventional building operation phases, there are still a lack of actual data on the operational carbon (OC) emissions of mass timber buildings. There is also a lack of research pertaining to the operational carbon of buildings within larger campuses and their inherent energy usage. This study, therefore, aims to quantify empirical data on the carbon footprint of a mass timber building, using, as a case study, the recent Adohi Hall building, situated at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. The study also aims to examine and identify the best energy use scenarios for the campus building under consideration. The research team obtained data on Adohi Hall’s energy consumption, fuel input usage, and other utilities (such as water, electricity, chilled water, and natural gas) accounting for the operation of the building from 2021 to 2023, a span of three years. The University of Arkansas Facilities Management (FAMA) provided the data. The study relies on the life cycle assessment (LCA) as its primary approach, with SimaPro 9, Ecoinvent v3.7 database, DataSmart, version 2023.1 and the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory (USLCI) database utilized to model the energy and water consumption of Adohi Hall during the operational phase (B6 & B7). The results indicate 4496 kg CO2 eq emissions associated with the operation per square meter of Adohi Hall over its 50-year lifespan. The study also examines various scenarios of fuel sources leading to carbon emissions and provides insights into reduction strategies during the operational phase of buildings. Among them, the electricity based on a cleaner fuel source diversification, according to realistic expectations and technological advancements projections, results in a 17% reduction in Adohi Hall’s OC. Due to the usage of the combined heat and power (CHP) plant on the campus of the University of Arkansas as a complementary source of electricity and heating for Adohi Hall, the resulting carbon emission is approximately 21% (20.73%) less when compared to similar buildings in the same city but outside the campus. The study, therefore, reveals that CHP plant development is a highly effective strategy for building OC reduction.

The wide metabolic diversity of microalgae, their fast growth rates, and low-cost production make these organisms highly promising resources for a variety of biotechnological applications, addressing critical needs in industry, agriculture, and medicine. The use of microalgae in consortia with bacteria is proving valuable in several areas of biotechnology, including the treatment of various types of wastewater, the production of biofertilizers, and the extraction of various products from their biomass. The monoculture of the microalga Chlamydomonas has been a prominent research model for many years and has been extensively used in the study of photosynthesis, sulphur and phosphorus metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, respiration, and flagellar synthesis, among others. Recent research has increasingly recognised the potential of Chlamydomonas–bacteria consortia as a biotechnological tool for various applications. The detoxification of wastewater using Chlamydomonas and its bacterial consortia offers significant potential for sustainable reduction of contaminants, while facilitating resource recovery and the valorisation of microalgal biomass. The use of Chlamydomonas and its bacterial consortia as biofertilizers can offer several benefits, such as increasing crop yields, protecting crops, maintaining soil fertility and stability, contributing to CO2 mitigation, and contributing to sustainable agricultural practises. Chlamydomonas–bacterial consortia play an important role in the production of high-value products, particularly in the production of biofuels and the enhancement of H2 production. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential of Chlamydomonas monoculture and its bacterial consortia to identify current applications and to propose new research and development directions to maximise their potential.

In order to reveal the migration and evolution of gas molecules in the actual oil–paper insulation composite system of transformer from the molecular level, the diffusion behavior of seven gas molecules (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6) generated during the operation and aging of oil-immersed transformers in the oil–paper composite insulation system is studied by molecular dynamics. Firstly, based on the molecular dynamics software, the model of the oil–paper composite insulation system and the gas molecule model is constructed. In order to compare and analyze the diffusion properties of gas molecules in a single medium, a single model of insulating oil and cellulose is also constructed. Then, the diffusion coefficients of gas molecules in the insulating oil, cellulose, and oil–paper insulating composite system are simulated and calculated. And the differences in the diffusion properties of gas molecules in the three insulating mediums are discussed. Finally, the microscopic mechanism of diffusion of different gas molecules in the three mediums is analyzed. The simulation results show that among the three mediums, the diffusion coefficient of H2 is the largest, while the diffusion coefficients of the other gas molecules are not very different. The diffusion coefficients of the seven gas molecules are the smallest in the oil-immersed paper composite insulation system, followed by cellulose, while the diffusion coefficients are the largest in mineral oil. It indicates that the diffusion of gas molecules is inhibited in oil–paper insulation systems where the insulating paper is completely immersed in oil. This is mainly due to the fact that the insulating oil completely penetrates into the paper, filling the pores and voids between the fibers, resulting in a reduction in the transition vacancies of the intermediate gas molecules, which hinders the diffusion of the gas molecules.

Purpose This study investigates the causal relationship and mechanisms between the development of digital finance and household carbon emissions. Its objective is to explore how digital finance can influence the carbon footprint at the household level, aiming to contribute to the broader understanding of financial innovations' environmental impacts. Design/methodology/approach The research combines macro and micro data, employing input-output analysis to utilize data from the China Household Finance Survey (CHFS) for the years 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019, national input-output tables, and Energy Statistical Yearbooks. This approach calculated CO2 emissions at the household level, including the growth rate of household carbon emissions and per capita emissions. It further integrates the Peking University Digital Financial Inclusion Index of China (PKU-DFIIC) for 2012–2018 and corresponding urban economic data, resulting in panel data for 7,191 households across 151 cities over four years. A fixed effects model was employed to examine the impact of digital finance development on household carbon emissions. Findings The findings reveal that digital finance significantly lowers household carbon emissions. Further investigation shows that digital transformation, consumption structure upgrades, and improved household financial literacy enhance the restraining effect of digital finance on carbon emissions. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that this mitigating effect is more pronounced in households during the nurturing phase, those using convenient payment methods, small-scale, and urban households. Sub-index tests suggest that the broadening coverage and deepening usage of digital finance primarily drive its impact on reducing household carbon emissions. Practical implications The paper recommends that China should continue to strengthen the layout of digital infrastructure, leverage the advantages of digital finance, promote digital financial education, and facilitate household-level carbon emission management to support the achievement of China's dual carbon goals. Originality/value The originality of this paper lies in its detailed examination of the carbon reduction effects of digital finance at the micro (household) level. Unlike previous studies on carbon emissions that focused on absolute emissions, this research investigates the marginal impact of digital finance on relative increases in emissions. This method provides a robust assessment of the net effects of digital finance and offers a novel perspective for examining household carbon reduction measures. The study underscores the importance of considering heterogeneity when formulating targeted policies for households with different characteristics.

Abstract. The high-resolution ship emission inventory serves as a crucial dataset for various disciplines including atmospheric science, marine science, environmental management, etc. Here, we present a global high spatiotemporal resolution ship emission inventory at a resolution of 0.1° × 0.1° for the years 2013, 2016–2021, generated by the state-of-the-art Shipping Emission Inventory Model (SEIMv2.2). Initially, the annual 30 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) data underwent extensive cleaning to ensure data validity and accuracy in temporal and spatial distribution. Subsequently, integrating real-time vessel positions and speeds from AIS data with static technical parameters, emission factors, and other computational parameters, SEIM simulated ship emissions on a ship-by-ship, signal-by-signal basis. Finally, the results were aggregated and analyzed. In 2021, the ship activity dataset established based on AIS data covered 109.3 thousand vessels globally (101.4 thousand vessels reported by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). Concerning the major air pollutants and greenhouse gases, global ships emitted 847.2 million tons of CO2, 2.3 million tons of SO2, 16.1 million tons of NOx, 791.2 kilo tons of CO, 737.3 kilo tons of HC, 415.5 kilo tons of primary PM2.5, 61.6 kilo tons of BC, 210.3 kilo tons of CH4, 45.1 kilo tons of N2O in 2021, accounting for 3.2 % of SO2, 14.2 % of NOx, and 2.3 % of CO2 emissions from all global anthropogenic sources, based on the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS). Due to the implementation of fuel-switching policies, global ship emissions of SO2 and primary PM2.5 saw a significant reduction of 81.3 % and 76.5 % in 2021 compared to 2019, respectively. According to the inventory results, the composition of vessel types contributing to global ship emissions remained relatively stable through the years, with container ships consistently contributing ~ 30 % of global ship emissions. Regarding vessel age distribution, the emission contribution of vessels built before 2000 (without Tier standard) has been declining, dropping to 10.2 % in 2021, suggesting that even a complete phase-out of these vessels would have limited potential for reducing NOx emissions in the short term. On the other hand, the emission contribution of vessels built after 2016 (meeting Tier III standard) kept increasing, reaching 13.3 % in 2021. Temporally, global ship emissions exhibited minimal daily fluctuations. Spatially, high-resolution emission characteristics of different vessel types were delineated. Patterns of ship emission contributions by different types of vessels vary among maritime regions, with container ships predominant in the North and South Pacific, bulk carriers predominant in the South Atlantic, and oil tankers prevalent in the Arabian Sea. The distribution characteristics of ship emissions and intensity also vary significantly across different maritime regions. Our dataset, which is accessible at https://zenodo.org/records/11069531 (Wen et al., 2024), provides daily breakdown by vessel type and age is available for broad research purposes, and it will provide a solid data foundation for fine-scale scientific research and shipping emission mitigation.

The cement industry is known for being highly energy-intensive and a significant contributor to global CO2 emissions. To address this environmental challenge, this study explores the potential of using the waste materials of steel slag (SS) and eggshell powder (ESP) as partial replacements for cement in alkali-activated mortars (AAMs) production, activated by NaOH and Na2SiO3. Mortar samples are prepared with 50% of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) as part of the total binder, and the remaining 50% is composed of ESP, incrementally replaced by SS at levels of 10%, 20%, 40%, and 50%. The activation process was performed with an 8% NaOH concentration and a silica modulus of 2. Key findings include that the workability of AAMs decreased with increasing SS content, requiring admixtures like superplasticizers or additional water to maintain workability. At 50% SS replacement, the water consistency and slump flow values were 32.56% and 105.73 mm, respectively, with a setting time reduction of approximately 36%, losing plasticity within 2 h. Both absorption capacity and porosity decreased as SS content increased from 10% to 50% of ESP. Additionally, the bulk density, compressive strength, and uniformity of the hardened mortar samples were enhanced with higher SS content, achieving maximum compressive strength (28.53 MPa) at 50% SS replacement after 56 days of curing. Furthermore, OPC-based AAMs incorporating SS and ESP demonstrate good resistance to sulfate attack and thermal heating. Microstructural analysis reveals the presence of C–S–H, C–A–S–H, and N–A–S–H phases, along with minor amounts of unreacted particles, and the microstructure shows a dense, highly compacted, and homogeneous morphology. These findings suggest that replacing eggshell powder with up to 50% steel slag enhances the hardened properties of AAMs. Further research is recommended to explore cement-free alkali-activated granular ground blast furnace slag (GGBFS) with ESP for more sustainable construction solutions.

Today, one of the major challenges of dairy farmers is to reduce their environmental footprint to establish more effective, efficient, and sustainable production systems. Feed additives such as yeast probiotics could potentially allow them to achieve these objectives through the improvement of milk production, feed efficiency, and ration valorization, hence mitigating the environmental impacts of milk production. In this study, the life cycle assessment (LCA) principle was performed to estimate the environmental impact of the production and supplementation of a commercial yeast probiotic (Actisaf Sc 47) in three trials performed in three different countries that are representative for around 50% of the milk production in Europe: France (French trial), United Kingdom (UK trial), and Germany (German trial). For each trial, two groups of animals were compared: control, without Actisaf Sc 47 supplementation, used as baseline; and experimental, with Actisaf Sc 47 supplementation at 5 or 10 g/cow/day. Different impact categories were analyzed for each group to calculate the impact of producing 1 kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk. An initial analysis was done only during the period of Actisaf Sc 47 supplementation and showed than the supplementation with Actisaf Sc 47 reduced, on average by 5%, the carbon footprint during the three trials. A second analysis was done via the extrapolation of all the data of each trial to an annual farm level, including the lactation period (305 days), dry period (60 days), and the period with and without Actisaf Sc 47 supplementation. Reported at a farm annual scale, the average reduction allowed by Actisaf Sc 47 supplementation was 2.9, 2.05, 2.47, 1.67, 2.28, 2.18, 2.14, and 2.28% of the carbon footprint, land use, water use, resource use, acidification, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, and terrestrial eutrophication, respectively. On average, the production of 1 kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk by using Actisaf Sc 47 was shown to improve environmental impacts compared to control. Regarding Actisaf Sc 47 production, the LCA showed that the production of 1 kg of Actisaf Sc 47 emitted 2.1 kg CO2 eq with a negligible contribution to total the carbon footprint of milk ranging from 0.005 to 0.016%. The use of Actisaf Sc 47 in dairy cows could then result in different positive outcomes: improving performance and efficiency while reducing the global carbon footprint.

This year’s Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) Technical Focus feature showcases industry advancements in sustainability practices through use of new digital technologies and circular economy, decarbonization, ecosystem, and biodiversity principles. Paper OTC 35396 graphically describes a holistic approach for industrial systems by strategic (outer) and operational (inner) circles integrating cybersecurity with process safety and human factors. Information technology, operations technology, and engineering technology converge to provide advanced opportunities for risk analysis, protection of critical systems, resilience of production systems, and personal and environmental safety, resulting in an integrated incident response. Paper SPE 216385 presents how, as part of a strategy to advance environmental excellence, a national oil company implemented sustainable and circular decarbonization, ecosystem, and biodiversity initiatives at Abu Ali Island, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. The initiatives include development of mangrove nurseries and plantation campaigns, construction of the Abu Ali Fish Hatchery, repurposing 34 km of old subsea pipelines to become coral reef habitats, rerouting treated sewage water to an irrigation system, converting food waste to compost to be used as fertilizer for agriculture, and continuous beach-cleaning campaigns. These actions promote the company’s sustainability focus areas of climate change and energy transition, safe operations, and people development, thereby minimizing environmental impact and growing societal value. Paper SPE 216338 describes how an operator implemented a new culture of circular decommissioning by applying the 3R circular economy principle—reuse, recycle, and reduce—during engineering and decommissioning of projects. To achieve asset-value maximization and CO2 footprint reduction, preused assets are reused for new projects and designs are created for long-life assets, products, and components. Modules and components are standardized to enable reuse and cost effectiveness, and assets and portions of assets are designed for reuse. This multiyear journey of the company’s new circular decommissioning culture begins with attention to its most-mature assets. Many more examples of recent notable achievements in HSE can be found in the OnePetro online library or presented through local SPE section meetings, SPE Live, webinars, workshops, and distinguished lectures. Knowledge sharing, on the local and global levels, encourages collaboration and solutions generation. Recommended additional reading at OnePetro: www.onepetro.org.

Количественные оценки баланса углерода ландшафтов суши и особенно криолитозоны, где наблюдаются наиболее значимые тренды потепления, требуют учета экспорта терригенного углерода за их пределы с латеральным стоком. В работе представлены результаты многолетнего круглогодичного мониторинга внутрисезонных и межгодовых флуктуаций концентраций растворенного органического (РОУ) и неорганического (РНУ) углерода в гидрографической сети Среднесибирского плоскогорья, осуществляемого на базе Эвенкийского стационара Института леса им. В. Н. Сукачева СО РАН (п. Тура). Исследования проводились на более чем 100 водотоках разного порядка в среднем течении р. Нижняя Тунгуска (62–66° с. ш., 96–102° в. д.) на основе регулярного измерения концентраций всех форм углерода, а также квазинепрерывного мониторинга физико-химических параметров водотоков с помощью автоматических логгеров-регистраторов. Показано, что основными лимитирующими факторами латерального стока углерода в пределах Среднесибирского плоскогорья в настоящее время являются запасы потенциально мобилизуемого органического углерода в наземных ландшафтах и количество осадков в условиях резко континентального климата. Рост стока органического углерода прогнозируется в результате как оттаивания богатых Соргмерзлых толщ, так и повышения продуктивности растительного покрова, а неорганического углерода – вследствие повышения скоростей выветривания горных пород и секвестрации атмосферного СО2. Отрицательные прогнозы поведения РОУ связываются с увеличением глубины инфильтрации растворов с ростом сезонно-талого слоя почвы, что определяет сорбцию РОУ в почвенной толще и его микробиологическую деструкцию. Возрастание площадей и интенсивности пожаров в результате потепления климата определяет существенную трансформацию латерального стока углерода. При этом наблюдаемое сокращение стока рек в результате усиления пирогенного фактора будет определять общее снижение транспорта терригенного углерода из наземных ландшафтов. Quantitative assessments of the carbon balance of terrestrial landscapes and, specifically the permafrost zone, where the most significant warming trends are observed, require taking into account the export of terrigenous carbon beyond their boundaries with lateral flow. The paper presents the results of long-term monitoring of intraseasonal and interannual fluctuations in the concentrations of dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic (DIC) carbon in the hydrographic network of the Central Siberian Plateau, carried out on the basis of the Evenkian field station of the V. N. Sukachev Institute of Forest, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences (Tura settlement). Research is being carried out on more than 100 streams and rivers of various orders in the middle reaches of the Lower Tunguska River (62–66°N, 96–102°E) based on regular measurements of the concentrations of all forms of carbon, as well as quasi-continuous monitoring of the physical and chemical parameters using specific sensors and automatic loggers. It has been shown that the main limiting factors of lateral carbon flux within the Central Siberian Plateau at present are: 1) stocks of potentially mobilizeable organic carbon in terrestrial landscapes and 2) amount of precipitation in a sharply continental climate. An increase in the DOC flux is predicted both as a result of thawing of C-rich frozen deposits and an increase in the productivity of plant cover, and inorganic carbon – as a result of increased rates of silicate rock weathering and sequestration of atmospheric CO2. Negative predictions of DOC behaviour are associated with an increase in the depth of infiltration of solutes with an increase in the seasonally thawed soil layer, which determines the sorption of DOC in the soil column and its microbiological destruction. An increase in the area and intensity of fires as a result of climate warming determines a significant transformation of the lateral carbon flux. At the same time, the observed reduction in river flow as a result of an increase in the pyrogenic factor will determine the overall decrease in the transport of terrigenous carbon from terrestrial landscapes.
