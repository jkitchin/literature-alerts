The rapid development of nanomaterial self-assembly technology has greatly favored the field of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and allowed for better control of catalyst structure and composition. Various self-assembly methods, such as DNA-directed assembly, matrix-assisted technology and solvent evaporation, have been used to improve catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Various newly created self-assembled catalysts have also contributed to the development of CO2RR, such as metal oxide catalysts, organic polymers and frameworks, organometallic frameworks and hybrid systems. This paper explored the application of the self-assembled nanocatalysts in CO2RR through a literature review and case studies, with an emphasis on how these methods can reduce CO2 to valuable products such as CO, methane and C2 compounds. The main results highlight the impact of self-assembled structures on improving reaction kinetics and product selectivity. The paper finds that self-assembly technologies and self-assembly nanocatalysts offer potential breakthroughs in improving CO reduction efficiency and contribute to the development of carbon capture and conversion technologies.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) presents a promising solution for mitigating CO2 emissions while producing valuable chemical feedstocks. Although single‐atom catalysts have shown potential in selectively converting CO2 to CH4, their limited active sites often hinder the realization of high current densities, posing a selectivity‐activity dilemma. In this study, we developed a single‐atom cobalt (Co) doped copper catalyst (Co1Cu) that achieved a CH4 Faradaic efficiency exceeding 60% with a partial current density of ‐482.7 mA cm‐2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the incorporation of single Co atoms enhances the activation and dissociation of H2O molecules, thereby lowering the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of *CO intermediates. In situ spectroscopic experiments and density functional theory simulations further demonstrated that the modulation of the *CO adsorption configuration, with stronger bridge‐binding, favours deep reduction to CH4 over the C‐C coupling or CO desorption pathways. Our findings underscore the potential of Co1Cu catalysts in overcoming the selectivity‐activity trade‐off, paving the way for efficient and scalable CO2‐to‐CH4 conversion technologies.

Abstract Reducing carbon dioxide （CO 2 ）to high‐value products using green renewable energy is a promising approach for addressing energy and greenhouse effect issues. Consequently, electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) technology has become a current research hotspot. Since the discovery of the high activity and selectivity of copper in the CO 2 RR, atomically dispersed Cu catalysts have garnered widespread attention due to their efficient atom utilization, unique electronic structure, and outstanding catalytic performance. However, a great challenge remains in providing rational catalyst design principles to achieve the regulation of product distribution. A clear understanding of catalytic materials and an in‐depth interpretation of the mechanism as well as the elucidation of the design strategy and research progress toward different products are the keys to building the understanding for solving the above problem. Therefore, this review starts with the introduction of advanced characterization techniques to reveal catalyst structure and reaction mechanisms. Then, various optimization strategies and the applications of atomically dispersed Cu catalysts in producing various high‐value targeted products are summarized and discussed. Finally, the perspectives on atomically dispersed Cu catalysts in the CO 2 RR field toward future development are offered.

Regarding the environmental impact of Ridesharing integrated with AVs, this paper examines the work done to identify substantial CO2 reductions possible with AV use. Drawing on the trends in the shift to AV and on the adoption of EVs, the paper estimates the potential green effects of swapping ICE vehicles for autonomous electric ones. We also discuss updates in AVs, infrastructure issues, solar power options for charging stations, future forecasts of global CO2 emissions, and the felt shortcomings of this study. The study shows that although AVs may hold the key to the dramatic reduction in emission levels, their potential is only as good as the infrastructure and policies in place, as well as a few technological constraints.

Modulating the oxidation state of copper (Cu) is crucial for enhancing the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), particularly for facilitating deep reductions to produce methane (CH4) or multi-carbon (C2+) products. However, Cuδ+ sites are thermodynamically unstable, fluctuating their oxidation states under reaction conditions, which complicates their functionality. Incorporating interfacial metal oxides has emerged as an effective strategy for stabilizing these oxidation states. This review provides an in-depth examination of the reaction mechanisms occurring at oxide-modified Cuδ+ sites, offering a comprehensive understanding of their behavior. We explore how Cu/metal oxide interfaces stabilize Cu oxidation states, showing that oxides-modified Cu catalysts often enhance selectivity for C2+ or CH4 products by stabilizing Cu+ or Cu2+ sites. In addition, we discuss innovative strategies for the rational design of efficient Cu catalytic sites tailored for specific deep CO2RR products. The review concludes with an outlook on current challenges and future directions, offering new insights into the rational design of selective and efficient CO2RR catalysts.

Abstract Electrocatalysis advances rely on the development of efficient catalysts. Systematic material design hinges on identifying activity and selectivity descriptors. While adsorption energy descriptors have helped predict new materials, they are typically based on pure metals, uncertain of their applicability to complex materials like alloys. Here, we systematically analyze the validity of descriptor models for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR). For this, we prepare gold, silver, and palladium alloys of variable composition and confirm experimentally the continuous variation of the d-band center (i.e. the CO adsorption energy) and work function (i.e. the potential of zero charge). Our results indicate that while the d-band center is the decisive factor for CO production, it, along with the work function, fails to fully explain the production of HCOO− and H2. Designing a copper-like alloy based on the matching of these descriptor values showed no formation of C2 products (as commonly expected for copper). This breakdown of the descriptor model is explained from first-principles calculations by the heterogeneity of the surface leading to different deactivation pathways for C2 product formation. Our results highlight the problems in transferring conventional descriptor models to more complex, heterogeneous materials motivating future developments.

Silylformates are emerging surrogates of hydrosilanes, able to reduce carbonyl groups in transfer hydrosilylation reactions, with the concomitant release of CO2. In this work, a new reactivity is revealed for silylformates, in the presence of imines. Using ruthenium catalysts, and lithium iodide as a co-catalyst, imines are shown to undergo hydrocarboxysilylation by formal insertion of CO2 to the N-Si bond of silyl amine to yield silyl carbamates in excellent yields.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as versatile materials with remarkably high surface areas and tunable properties, attracting significant attention for various applications. In this work, the modification of a UiO-66 MOF with metal nanoparticles (NPs) is investigated for the purpose of enhancing its photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to liquid fuels. Several NPs (Au, Cu, Ag, Pd, Pt, and Ni) were loaded into the UiO-66 framework and employed as photocatalysts. The synergistic effects of plasmonic resonance and MOF characteristics were investigated to improve photocatalytic performance. The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), confirming the successful integration of metal NPs onto the UiO-66 framework. Morphological analysis revealed distinct distributions and sizes of NPs on the UiO-66 surface for different metals. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiments demonstrated enhanced activity of plasmonic MOFs, yielding methanol and ethanol. The findings revealed by this study provide valuable insights into tailoring MOFs for improved photocatalytic applications through the incorporation of plasmonic metal nanoparticles.

This study explores the relationships between the digital economy, R&D investment, and carbon emissions, as well as the mediating role of financial technology (fintech). Despite a growing body of research, the impact of the digital economy on carbon emissions remains contested, partly due to the limited scope and inconsistent measures in existing studies. Additionally, while R&D is a pivotal driver of modern development, its potential quadratic effects on carbon emissions in China remain unexplored. By employing a comprehensive Digital Economy Index and analyzing panel data from 2011 to 2020 across Chinese regions, this study provides new insights into how digitalization and innovation influence carbon emissions. The findings reveal a positive linear correlation between the digital economy and CO2 emissions over the last decade. Moreover, R&D investments exhibit an inverse U-shaped relationship with emissions, acting as an effective factor in reducing CO2 emissions. Notably, the turning point of this relationship occurs in Quadrant I, where most regions are clustered, indicating substantial efficiency gains from early-stage R&D investments and their significant potential to enhance sustainable development. Furthermore, fintech emerges as a significant mediator in the R&D–emissions dynamic, underscoring its critical role in this context.

Abstract Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an important application that can considerably mitigate environmental and energy crises. However, the slow proton-coupled electron transfer process continues to limit overall catalytic performance. Fine-tuning the reaction microenvironment by accurately constructing the local structure of catalysts provides a novel approach to enhancing reaction kinetics. Here, cubic-phase α-MoC1−x nanoparticles were incorporated into a carbon matrix and coupled with cobalt phthalocyanine molecules (α-MoC1−x–CoPc@C) for the co-reduction of CO2 and H2O, achieving an impressive Faradaic efficiency for CO close to 100%. Through a combination of in-situ spectroscopies, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical simulations, it is demonstrated that α-MoC1−x nanoparticles and CoPc molecules with the optimized local configuration serve as the active centers for H2O activation and CO2 reduction, respectively. The interfacial water molecules were rearranged, forming a dense hydrogen bond network on the catalyst surface. This optimized microenvironment at the electrode–electrolyte interface synergistically enhanced water dissociation, accelerated proton transfer, and improved the overall performance of CO2RR.

One of the risks associated with climate change is carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, which can negatively affect human health and the ecosystem. The CO2 emission can lead to a decline in urban area quality that surpasses the environment's carrying capacity. This research aimed to investigate the relationship between CO2 Emissions from Transportation (X1), Household (X2), and Business Sector (X3) with the CO2 reduction of green open space (Y). The hypothesis is that there is a negative correlation between CO2 emissions from transportation, households, and businesses and CO2 reduction from green open spaces. A quantitative research design was adopted using the Slovin formula and cluster random sampling. The Normality and Homogeneity Tests are used to analyze research data. The study yielded the following results: first, the coefficient of determination (r2) = 0.003 indicates a relationship between CO2 emissions from transportation with CO2 reduction from green open space, with a 0.3% contribution. The second finding is that there is a 0.1% contribution from CO2 reduction from green open space to the CO2 emissions of households, as indicated by the coefficient of determination (r2) = 0.001. Third, a correlation of 0.1% between CO2 reduction from green open space and CO2 emissions from the Business Sector is indicated by the coefficient of determination (r2) = 0.001. Thus, using the regression equation Y = 2320.432 – 0.16X1 – 0,25 X2 – 0,007 X3, there is an overall significant relationship between CO2 emissions from transportation, CO2 emissions from households, and CO2 emissions from the business sector with the reduction of CO2 from green open space.

The study explores the phase transition of carbon dioxide from liquid to gas after injection and storage in a confined aquifer at a temperature of 30°C. By utilizing a compositional isotropic model and data from the NIST webbook (Linstrom and Mallard, 2024), the simulation analyzes, using compositional mesh model in tNavigator software (by Rock Flow Dynamics), the behavior of CO2 within a confined aquifer, seeking to identify the phase transition of the fluid. The effects of capillarity are neglected, and the main parameters of the reservoir are a pressure of 65 bar at the wellhead and a constant temperature of 31°C throughout the aquifer to evaluate the phase transition close to the supercritical point of CO2. The analysis reveals that the drastic pressure reduction within the confined aquifer leads to the formation of free gas within the reservoir after the closure of injection wells, which becomes a problem, as occurred in the Ordos CCS Project in China, allowing fluid backflow during non-injection (CAI, Yuna et al.). The results showed that the closer the temperature approaches the supercritical point of CO2, the greater the probability of free gas formation within the reservoir. Therefore, the conclusions emphasize the impact of the pressure reduction on the stability of CO2, which will undergo a phase transition from the liquid to the gaseous state, so that free gas is generated within the reservoir. In this way, it is highlighted the importance of understanding phase transition in CO2 injection processes for effective carbon capture and storage strategies.

Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is recognized as a critical driver of economic development in the modern era, significantly enhancing the productivity of production factors. However, the widespread adoption of ICT, particularly in countries reliant on fossil fuels, may contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2). So, this study investigates the interconnections among ICT, CO2, renewable energy, and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in Iran. This descriptive-analytical and applied study used time series data from the World Bank and Iran Statistics Center from 2000 to 2023. This study, the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to evaluate the long-term and short-term dynamic, unit root tests and diagnostic tests CUSUM and CUSUMQ and Canonical Co-Integrating Regression (CCR) Dynamic least squares (DOLS), and fully modified least squares (FMOLS) have been used to validate the results of ADRL estimates. The results of the ARDL estimation method showed that in the long run, TFP and economic growth on carbon dioxide had a coefficient of 0.07 and 0.14, respectively. Renewable energy consumption with a coefficient of -0.0808 had a significant negative role in reducing carbon dioxide. The coefficient of -0.286 obtained for the ICT variable at 95% indicates a reduction in carbon dioxide in parallel with the development of ICT. CUSUM and CUSUMQ confirmed the stability of the parameters, and CCR, DOLS, and FMOLS regressions confirmed the results of the ADRL model. The study recommends adopting green technologies and effective energy policies to balance productivity gains with environmental protection.

The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) presents a promising solution for mitigating CO2 emissions while producing valuable chemical feedstocks. Although single‐atom catalysts have shown potential in selectively converting CO2 to CH4, their limited active sites often hinder the realization of high current densities, posing a selectivity‐activity dilemma. In this study, we developed a single‐atom cobalt (Co) doped copper catalyst (Co1Cu) that achieved a CH4 Faradaic efficiency exceeding 60% with a partial current density of ‐482.7 mA cm‐2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the incorporation of single Co atoms enhances the activation and dissociation of H2O molecules, thereby lowering the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of *CO intermediates. In situ spectroscopic experiments and density functional theory simulations further demonstrated that the modulation of the *CO adsorption configuration, with stronger bridge‐binding, favours deep reduction to CH4 over the C‐C coupling or CO desorption pathways. Our findings underscore the potential of Co1Cu catalysts in overcoming the selectivity‐activity trade‐off, paving the way for efficient and scalable CO2‐to‐CH4 conversion technologies.

Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion to value-added, highly reduced chemicals such as methanol (CH3OH) is a promising possibility for producing renewable fuel and simultaneous CO2 recycling. However, this process remains a challenge, with only a few selective electrocatalysts known. Here, we present a study of a palladium monolayer on a platinum (111) single crystal (PdML/Pt(111)) as an electrocatalyst for CO2 conversion to CH3OH. A custom-made setup was employed in order to detect and quantify gaseous and liquid CO2 reduction products in sufficient concentrations despite the limitations of working with a single-crystalline electrode. Under ambient reaction conditions, a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 1.5% at −0.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was obtained while using CO2 as the reactant. Other reaction intermediates, carbon monoxide (CO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) were subsequently used as reactants, leading to FEs of 1.8 and 2.5%, respectively, whereas formic acid is not reduced. The corresponding mechanism concluded from our work is compared to the literature. The electrocatalyst introduced here, with a highly well-defined structure for CO2 conversion to CH3OH, opens up possibilities for further catalytic explorations.

Reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is vital at both global and national levels, given their significant role in exacerbating climate change. CO2 emissions, stemming from a variety of industrial and economic activities, are major contributors to the greenhouse effect and global warming, posing substantial obstacles in addressing climate issues. It is imperative to forecast CO2 emissions trends and classify countries based on their emission patterns to effectively mitigate worldwide carbon emissions. This paper presents an in-depth comparative study on the determinants of CO2 emissions in twenty countries with high Human Development Index (HDI), exploring factors related to economy, environment, energy use, and renewable resources over a span of 25 years. The study unfolds in two distinct phases: initially, statistical techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), fixed effects, and random effects models are applied to pinpoint significant determinants of CO2 emissions. Following this, the study leverages supervised and unsupervised time series approaches to further scrutinize and understand the factors influencing CO2 emissions. Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables (SARIMAX), a statistical time series forecasting model, is first used to predict emission trends from historical data, offering practical insights for policy formulation. Subsequently, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), an unsupervised time series clustering approach, is used to group countries by similar emission patterns. The dual-phase approach utilized in this study significantly improves the accuracy of CO2 emissions predictions while also providing a deeper insight into global emission trends. By adopting this thorough analytical framework, nations can develop more focused and effective carbon reduction policies, playing a vital role in the global initiative to combat climate change.

Climate change is driven by a combination of natural fluctuations and human activities, particularly the widespread use of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas) and alterations in land use practices such as logging, farming, and clearing land for agriculture. This global phenomenon encompasses various end-of-use activities, including agriculture, forestry, and consumerism. An inherent challenge in the global carbon dioxide (CO2) trading landscape lies in the competition between developed and developing countries, stemming from inconsistent CO2 prices. This competition manifests in three primary areas. Firstly, in the context of internationally transmitted mitigation outcomes, involving international trade aimed at surpassing Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) targets. Secondly, it pertains to sustainable development mechanisms, specifically the use of carbon offsets derived from projects implemented by both public and private entities worldwide. The third aspect revolves around non-market approaches, encompassing emission reduction through mitigation and adaptation efforts, financial support, technology transfer, and capacity building, which may involve tools like carbon taxes and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). This research adopts a legal norm perspective, delving into methods that investigate, describe, synthesize, interpret, evaluate, and analyze positive approaches. The findings signify a paradigm shift aligning with the "polluter pays principle," recognizing that entities and individuals responsible for environmental pollution should bear the associated costs. In the quest for a new paradigm of sustainable development, a carbon market ecosystem assumes a pivotal role. This ecosystem contributes to enhancing sustainability by curbing greenhouse gas emissions and offering economic incentives to address climate change. It acts as a cornerstone in constructing a fresh paradigm for potential development.

Climate change is a contemporary global challenge that requires comprehensive solutions to mitigate its adverse effects. All human activities contribute to climate change, mainly through atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4). While most of these emissions are primarily due to fossil fuel use, agriculture and livestock production also contribute to a significant share of approximately 12% of global emissions. Most processes that are implemented within an animal husbandry unit are associated with greenhouse gas emissions, including manure management. This review explores the interconnection between climate change and manure management practices, highlighting the potential for sustainable approaches to mitigating GHG emissions. The key strategies for manure management, such as anaerobic digestion, nutrient management, composting, manure separation and treatment, and improved storage and handling, are discussed, as they are implemented in different livestock production systems (ruminants, poultry, and pigs). Despite the technological progress, there is still a place for further improving manure management approaches, especially in non-ruminant species leading to a higher mitigation potential and a reduction in greenhouse gases emissions. Moreover, policy support and incentives for sustainable practices are crucial for widespread adoption.

Coastal wetlands, including freshwater systems near large lakes, rapidly bury carbon, but less is known about how they transport carbon either to marine and lake environments or to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide and methane. This study examines how GHG production and organic matter (OM) mobility in coastal wetland soils vary with the availability of oxygen and other terminal electron acceptors. We also evaluated how OM and redox-sensitive species varied across different size fractions: particulates (0.45–1μm), fine colloids (0.1–0.45μm), and nano particulates plus truly soluble (<0.1μm; NP+S) during 21-day aerobic and anaerobic slurry incubations. Soils were collected from the center of a freshwater coastal wetland (FW-C) in Lake Erie, the upland-wetland edge of the same wetland (FW-E), and the center of a saline coastal wetland (SW-C) in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Anaerobic methane production for FW-E soils were 47 and 27,537 times greater than FW-C and SW-C soils, respectively. High Fe2+ and dissolved sulfate concentrations in FW-C and SW-C soils suggest that iron and/or sulfate reduction inhibited methanogenesis. Aerobic CO2 production was highest for both freshwater soils, which had a higher proportion of OM in the NP+S fraction (64±28% and 70±10% for FW-C and FW-E, respectively) and organic C:N ratios reflective of microbial detritus (5.3±5.3 and 5.3±7.0 for FW-E and FW-C, respectively) compared to SW-C, which had a higher fraction of particulate (58±9%) and fine colloidal (19±7%) OM and organic C:N ratios reflective of vegetation detritus (11.4 ± 1.7). The variability in GHG production and shifts in OM size fractionation and composition observed across freshwater and saline soils collected within individual and across different sites reinforce the high spatial variability in the processes controlling OM stability, mobility, and bioavailability in coastal wetland soils.

Environment has been defined as the natural world in which living things dwell and grow. There are certain factors which often pose challenges to the environment and are capable of interrupting capacity building as well as sustainability. This research evaluates such factors as environmental contaminants which include any chemical, biological, or radiological substance or matter that hurts air, water, soil or living organisms. However, with the advancement of green technologies on the environment, there is a revolutionary change with regards to clean energy production, solar power, reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide, use of alternative fuels and other technologies that are less harmful to the environment than fossil fuels. This research focuses on clean energy production such as solar energy and other technologies that serve the best purpose of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide usually generated by vehicles, motorcycles and fuel power generators majorly in the cities, particularly in the industrial environments. These emissions from vehicle engines, power generators, gas flaring and other environmental contaminants are very dangerous to human health. Many, who have ingested these emissions, have serious interference with their bodies’ internal functioning, causing diseases like cancer, itching in the eyes and respiratory disorders like asthma. The pressing need to explore green technologies for sustainability becomes imperative and this gave rise to this research. To achieve this aim, this research adopts the doctrinal research methodology in examining the natural environmental contaminants and the impact of green technologies on climate change. On this premise, this research recommends tremendous exploration of green technologies as a recipe for a sustainable environment.

In particular, an analysis of the impact of providing a highly energy-efficient building thermal envelope and its heat supply using renewable energy sources during the modernization of the existing administrative building in Ukraine to the level of the requirements of the European Union was carried out. This analysis considered economic, technical, and environmental factors. Thus, the authors present the results of dynamic modeling of the building's energy consumption at different levels of building insulation and make a payback forecast for improving the thermal envelope and using various sources of heat supply (including using a heat pump and a pellet boiler). To assess emissions reduction of the proposed building modernization options, an analysis of the existing national methods of calculating carbon dioxide emissions was carried out, and the option of a combination of a heat pump and photovoltaic panels was considered.

In this study, emissions from boilers and steel furnaces with and without emission control systems (ECS), more especially wet scrubbers, were assessed. The concentrations of PM, SO₂, and NOₓ were determined using an isokinetic assembly for particulate matter (PM) monitoring and a flue gas analyzer for CO, NOX and SO₂ monitoring. The efficacy of the wet scrubber in capturing airborne particles was demonstrated by the remarkable 70% reduction in PM emissions observed in the steel furnace findings. There was no discernible change in CO2 levels, and emissions of SOx and NOx were reduced by 15% and 16%, respectively, but CO emissions only dropped by 3.31%. With a reduction of 70.22% in SOx emissions, the wet scrubber proved to be the most efficient in lowering emissions of NOx (30.79%) and PM (27.75%) in the context of boilers. CO2 levels marginally increased while CO emissions declined by 17.75%. In general, the wet scrubber demonstrated significant efficacy in mitigating pollutants, including PM and SOx; however, its influence on CO and CO2 was restricted.

Boron-doped diamond (BDD) is an excellent functional electrode material used as a working electrode in the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Formic acid production with approximately 100% Faradaic efficiency has been achieved via CO2 reduction using BDD electrodes. In this study, we investigated the production performance stability during long-term electrolysis by focusing on ion transport in the electrolyte during electrolysis. Initially, we investigated the behavior of potassium ions (K+) and pH during long-term electrolysis in detail. A relationship was observed between the change in ion concentrations and formic acid production, crucial in formic acid production. Based on this knowledge, we successfully achieved stable formic acid production for an extremely long time (1264 h) by controlling ion transport. In addition to utilizing the durability of BDD electrodes as stable electrode materials, controlling ion transport has paved the way for the industrialization of formic acid production via CO2 reduction.

The capture and utilization of CO2 from industrial off-gases to produce commodity chemicals has the potential to make an important contribution to the transition to a circular economy. Formate, and its conjugate formic acid, is a potential sustainable platform chemical that can be produced from CO2. Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate is a promising route, but biocatalysis with formate dehydrogenase (FDH) as biocatalyst may offer advantages for industrial implementation such as mild conditions, high product selectivity, and less expensive down-stream processing. Here, we investigated the potential of a metal-independent Thiobacillus FDH (TsFDH) as a biocatalyst for the production of formate from CO2-rich industrial offgases. An excellent stability was demonstrated, also in the presence of potential off-gas impurities. A formate titer of 14 mM could be achieved at pH 6.5 and 37 °C, with an initial specific productivity of 0.37 mmol g−1FDH h−1. TsFDH compares favorably to metal-dependent FDHs with respect to stability, O2-sensitivity and activity at low pH values, but unfavorably in terms of CO2 reduction activity, hampering its potential as industrial biocatalyst. Specific rates could be significantly improved by further reaction engineering, and possibly also by enzyme engineering.

Republicans and Democrats practically everywhere have been demonstrating concerns about environmental conservation to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) since the turn of the century. To promote fuel (energy) savings and a reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide CO 2 emissions in several enterprises, actions have been taken based on the concepts described. This study proposes an environmentally friendly manufacturing system designed to minimize environmental impacts. Specifically, it aims to develop a sustainable manufacturing process that accounts for energy consumption and CO 2 emissions from direct and indirect energy sources. A multi-objective mathematical model has been formulated, incorporating financial and environmental constraints, to minimize overall costs, energy consumption, and CO 2 emissions within the manufacturing framework. The input model parameters for real-world situations are generally unpredictable, so a fuzzy multi-objective model will be developed as a way to handle it. The validity of the proposed ecological industrial design will be tested using a scenario-based approach. Results demonstrate the high reliability, applicability, and effectiveness of the proposed network when analyzed using the developed techniques.

Health system and environmental factors play a significant role in achieving the World Health Organization (WHO) End Tuberculosis (TB) targets. However, quantitative measures are scarce or non-existent at a global level. We aimed to measure the progress made towards meeting the global End TB milestones from 2015 to 2020 and identify health system and environmental factors contributing to the success. We obtained data from ten different online data repositories and used principal component analysis to create domain-specific health system performance measures. We used radar charts and dumbbell plots to show the country's progress in ending TB with their health systems. Lastly, we used a linear regression model to identify key health systems and environmental predictors of the percent reduction in TB incidence and mortality. There was a high variation in TB incidence and mortality reduction between countries and WHO regions. Of all countries included, 75 (39.3%) achieved more than a 20% reduction in TB incidence between 2015 and 2020. However, only 31 (16.2%) reached a 35% reduction in TB mortality. The European Region achieved the highest incidence reduction, exceeding the 2020 milestone with a 25% reduction. The African Region also made notable progress, achieving an 18% mortality reduction despite its relatively poor health systems. Health system factors, such as TB financing, TB-specific health service delivery, access to medicine, and governance, were significantly associated with TB mortality reduction between 2015 and 2020. Environmental factors, such as average annual temperature and air particulate matter concentration, were found to have a significant negative effect on TB incidence and mortality reduction. Weak health systems were identified as major barriers to achieving the End TB milestones in most high-burden countries. Hence, strengthening health systems with a special focus on TB financing, service delivery, and access to medicine in these countries should be prioritised to achieve global TB mortality reduction targets. Countries should follow WHO's air quality guidelines and rapidly reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the impact of environmental factors.

In this study, pre-treated low-carbon steel substrates were electroplated with Zinc–Nickel (ZN) alloy composite coatings enhanced by the incorporation of nano-silicon dioxide (SiO2) particles in an alkaline solution. ZN deposits with varying concentrations of nano-SiO2—specifically, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 wt%—were achieved by adjusting the ratio between the nano-SiO2 and ZN alloy electroplating solutions. The influence of the nano-SiO2 content on both the quality of the coating and its corrosion behavior was investigated in detail. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and an atomic force microscope (AFM) were utilized to assess the surface, cross-section structure, elemental composition, and thickness of the coatings. Notably, the addition of nano-SiO2 improved the microstructure of the coating, leading to a reduction in grain size as well as enhancements in uniformity and density while revealing that co-deposition reached an optimal concentration at 3 wt% nano-SiO2. The corrosion behavior of coated specimens was evaluated through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and polarization techniques within a 3.5 wt% NaCl solution serving as a corrosive medium. Specifically, for typical prepared coatings, the corrosion current density decreased from 1.410 × 10−4 A·cm−2 to 5.762 × 10−6 A·cm−2, which is a remarkable reduction by one to two orders of magnitude relative to the SiO2-free coatings mentioned previously. These findings provide a straightforward approach for selecting 3 wt% nano-SiO2 as an effective additive in ZN composite coatings.

Background: The aim of this study was to develop an electrolysis system to produce silver nanoparticles free from toxic gases, as the most common reduction and electrolysis techniques produce nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as a byproduct, which is harmful to human health. The new electrolysis system used two identical silver plate electrodes, replacing silver and carbon rods, and used water as the electrolyte instead of silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution since AgNO3 is the source of NO2. Methods: The electrolytic silver nanoparticles (ESNs) produced by the new system were characterized and compared with reductive silver nanoparticles (RSNs). Using UV–Visible spectrophotometry, absorption peaks were found at 425 nm (ESN) and 437 nm (RSN). Using dynamic light scattering, the particle diameters were measured at 40.3 nm and 39.9 nm for ESNs at concentrations of 10 ppm and 30 ppm, respectively, and 74.0 nm and 74.6 nm for RSNs at concentrations of 10 ppm and 30 ppm, respectively. Antibacterial activity against Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) was assessed using the Kirby–Bauer method. Results: It was found that the efficacy of ESNs and RSNs was relatively lower than that of 5% chloramphenicol because it was measured in different concentration units (ESNs and RSNs in ppm and chloramphenicol in %). Using the calibration curve, the efficacy of 5% chloramphenicol was comparable to that of 0.005% ESN. It was also found that P. acnes developed a strong resistance to chloramphenicol and showed no resistance to ESNs. Conclusions: This finding underlines the tremendous potential of ESNs as a future antibiotic raw material.

This study investigates the use of iron ore tailings (IOTs) as recycled aggregates in segmental blocks, focusing on technical performance, CO2 emissions, and embodied energy using the cradle-to-gate approach. IOTs replaced fine aggregates in concrete at 25%, 50%, and 75% by volume, achieving compressive strengths of 16.23 MPa, 10.02 MPa, and 3.93 MPa, respectively. Raw material production accounted for 98% of CO2 emissions and 86% of embodied energy. Producing blocks at mining sites offered limited environmental benefits due to longer transport distances. Despite this, the results showed a 6% reduction in CO2 emissions and a 35% improvement in mechanical–environmental performance (CO2 emissions weighted by compressive strength) compared to traditional concrete. These findings underscore the potential of IOT-based concrete for segmental block production.

Abstract Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO is demonstrated with symmetric-structured metal supported solid oxide cells (MS-SOC). Perovskite Pr0.5Sr0.4Mn0.2Fe0.8O3-δ (PSMF) and Pr6O11 catalysts were infiltrated into the MS-SOC cathode and anode, using 3 cycles with firing at 850C and 8 cycles with firing at 800C, respectively. Upon reduction during operation, the perovskite PSMF was transformed to Ruddlesden–Popper structure with a highly efficient electrocatalytic activity. The impact of operating temperature (600-800C) and overpotential (0-1.8 V) on the CO2 conversion was investigated. The highest CO2 conversion of 57.2% was achieved at 750C and 1.8 V. During extended operation for 150 h at 750C and 1.2V, a cell demonstrated relatively stable performance, with initial current density of 535 mA cm-2 and CO2 conversion of 23%. Degradation mechanisms were studied by posttest characterization.

Abstract. Independent estimation and verification of fossil CO2 emissions on a regional and national scale are crucial for evaluating the fossil CO2 emissions and reductions reported by countries as part of their nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Top-down methods, such as the assimilation of in situ and satellite observations of different tracers (e.g., CO2, CO, Δ14CO2, XCO2), have been increasingly used for this purpose. In this paper, we use the Lund University Modular Inversion Algorithm (LUMIA) to estimate fossil CO2 emissions and natural fluxes by simultaneously inverting in situ synthetic observations of CO2 and Δ14CO2 over Europe. We evaluate the inversion system by conducting a series of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs). We find that in regions with a dense sampling network, such as western/central Europe, adding Δ14CO2 observations in an experiment where the prior fossil CO2 and biosphere fluxes are set to zero allows LUMIA to recover the time series of both categories. This reduces the prior-to-truth root mean square error (RMSE) from 1.26 to 0.12 TgC d−1 in fossil CO2 and from 0.97 to 0.17 TgC d−1 in biosphere fluxes, reflecting the true total CO2 budget by 91 %. In a second set of experiments using realistic prior fluxes, we find that in addition to retrieving the time series of the optimized fluxes, we are able to recover the true regional fossil CO2 budget in western/central Europe by 95 % and in Germany by 97 %. In all experiments, regions with low sampling coverage, such as southern Europe and the British Isles, show poorly resolved posterior fossil CO2 emissions. Although the posterior biosphere fluxes in these regions follow the seasonal patterns of the true fluxes, a significant bias remains, making it impossible to close the total CO2 budget. We find that the prior uncertainty of fossil CO2 emissions does not significantly impact the posterior estimates, showing similar results in regions with good sampling coverage like western/central Europe and northern Europe. Finally, having a good prior estimate of the terrestrial isotopic disequilibrium is important to avoid introducing additional noise into the posterior fossil CO2 fluxes.

CO2 flooding plays a crucial role in enhancing oil recovery and achieving carbon reduction targets, particularly in unconventional reservoirs with complex pore structures. The phase behavior of CO2 and hydrocarbons at different scales significantly affects oil recovery efficiency, yet its underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. This study improves existing thermodynamic models by introducing Helmholtz free energy as a convergence criterion and incorporating adsorption effects in micro- and nano-scale pores. This study refines existing thermodynamic models by incorporating Helmholtz free energy as a convergence criterion, offering a more accurate representation of confined phase behavior. Unlike conventional Gibbs free energy-based models, this approach effectively accounts for confinement-induced deviations in phase equilibrium, ensuring improved predictive accuracy for nanoscale reservoirs. Additionally, adsorption effects in micro- and nano-scale pores are explicitly integrated to enhance model reliability. A multi-scale thermodynamic model for CO2-hydrocarbon systems is developed and validated through physical simulations. Key findings indicate that as the scale decreases from bulk to 10 nm, the bubble point pressure shows a deviation of 5% to 23%, while the density of confined fluids increases by approximately 2%. The results also reveal that smaller pores restrict gas expansion, leading to an enhanced CO2 solubility effect and stronger phase mixing behavior. Through phase diagram analysis, density expansion, multi-stage contact, and differential separation simulations, we further clarify how confinement influences CO2 injection efficiency. These findings provide new insights into phase behavior changes in confined porous media, improving the accuracy of CO2 flooding predictions. The proposed model offers a more precise framework for evaluating phase transitions in unconventional reservoirs, aiding in the optimization of CO2-based enhanced oil recovery strategies.

Quicklime (CaO) is extensively used in metallurgy, chemical engineering, materials science, and greenhouse gas reduction due to its high reactivity, low energy consumption, and environmental benefits. It is considered as one of the most promising raw materials for nanomaterial synthesis and carbon dioxide capture. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the impact of limestone composition and calcination condition. Recent research, however, suggests that the structural characteristics of limestone also play a crucial role in determining the reactivity of quicklime. This study investigates the effect of limestone structure on quicklime reactivity and provides a mechanistic analysis. Three types of limestone with varying structures—clastic-structured, transitional-crystalline-structured, and crystalline-structured—were selected for experiments under different calcination times. The results indicate that quicklime produced from clastic-structured limestone exhibits the highest reactivity. The observed differences in quicklime reactivity can primarily be attributed to the following factors: (1) Clastic-structured limestone possesses larger pore volume and specific surface area, which enhance heat conduction and ensure the uniform decomposition of calcite across various regions. (2) The rock-forming calcite particles are fine and small, allowing for the simultaneous decomposition of the outer shell, middle, and core during heating. This prevents “overburning” of the shell or “underfiring” of the core, thereby improving the overall reactivity. Based on these findings, we propose that fine-grained, high-purity clastic-structured limestone is more favorable for producing high-activity quicklime.

Bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) emerges as a potent catalyst for converting CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH), leveraging its abundant lattice oxygen and the high activity of its Bi‐O bonds. Yet, its durability is usually impeded by the loss of lattice oxygen causing structure alteration and destabilized active bonds. Herein, we report an innovative approach via the interstitial incorporation of indium (In) into the Bi2O3, significantly enhancing bond stability and preserving lattice oxygen. The optimized In‐Bi2O3‐100 catalyst achieves over 90% Faradaic efficiency for HCOOH production across a wide potential range, in both H‐cells and flow cells, maintaining robust stability after 100 hours of continuous operation. In‐situ surface‐enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the interstitial In doping precisely tunes the adsorption of CO2* and OCHO* intermediate, facilitating rapid conversion. Further in‐situ Raman spectroscopy confirms the role of In bolstering the oxidized structure's stability within Bi2O3, critical for sustaining lattice oxygen during electrochemical CO2 reduction.

In response to the need to develop green low-carbon iron smelting technology, blast furnace hydrogen reduction technology is of great significance for reducing CO2 emissions from the ironmaking system. This study focuses on the change in swelling behaviour of different types of pellets during the blast furnace hydrogen smelting process. It analyses the reduction swelling index (RSI/%) and compression strength before and after reduction at 900°C in a variety of reduction gas atmospheres, among other indices. The results show that under the condition of ore grade, the reduction expansion rate of pellet increases with the increase of grade. With the increase of basicity (R) (0 ∼ 0.25) and the Mg-Al ratio (M/A) (0.4 ∼ 1.4), the reduction in expansion of the pellet shows an upward trend. However, the RSI/% shows a downward trend with the increase of the synergistic effect of ore silicon and aluminium (S + A). The compression strength after reduction increases to different degrees with the increase of the proportion of hydrogen in the reduction atmosphere; the maximum increase was about 0.591 KN. SEM-EDS detection was carried out on pellet in different reduction atmospheres, and the structure and component changes of various regions during the reduction process were analysed.

The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted attention as a promising strategy for converting CO2 into value-added products. Gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) loaded with metallic nanoparticles as electrocatalysts are expected to efficiently reduce CO2 due to the high specific surface area of such particles and the superior mass transport characteristics of GDEs. In the present study, GDEs loaded with homogeneous layers of gold (Au) nanoparticles were fabricated using a radio frequency sputtering technique that had a low deposition rate. This allowed for precise control of the catalyst loading. The Au-loaded GDEs exhibited a significantly higher CO production efficiency compared with the electrodes fabricated by conventional deposition methods using dispersed Au nanoparticles. Additionally, a Au-loaded GDE having a catalytic layer thickness of 10 nm demonstrated a mass-based CO production activity of 1882 A g–1 at −0.85 V. This is the highest value yet reported. This work confirmed that the uniform deposition of metallic nanoparticles provides enhanced catalyst utilization. The results of this research provide important insights into the design of efficient CO2RR electrodes and highlight the potential of radio frequency sputtering to fabricate high-performance CO2RR electrodes as an approach to realizing carbon-neutral technologies.

ABSTRACT Alkaline salt stress, as a more diverse stress, severely affects the growth and development of potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) and leads to yield reduction. Brassinosteroids have been shown to regulate plant growth and play an essential role under environmental stress. However, the physiological responses by which brassinosteroids confer alkaline salt stress tolerance in potato remain unclear. We used potato ‘ Atlantic ’ as experimental material. The effects of 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 μmol·L −1 of 24‐epibrassinolide (EBR) on the physiological and photosynthetic characteristics of potato under alkaline salt stress (300 mmol·L −1 NaHCO 3 ) were studied. The results showed that exogenous EBR increased the antioxidant enzyme activities, increased the content of osmoregulatory substances and decreased the production of peroxidation products in potato leaves under alkaline salt stress. EBR treatment improved the photosynthetic characteristics by accumulating more photosynthetic pigments. This was manifested by an increase in net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance, and a decrease in intercellular carbon dioxide concentration. In addition, exogenous EBR increased the maximal quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry and the effective PSII quantum yield of potato PSII under alkaline salt stress and ultimately increased yield. Potato tuber yield was significantly increased by 27.31% and 29.17% in T4 treatment compared to T1 in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Cluster and correlation analyses further demonstrated the beneficial effects of exogenous EBR on physiology, photosynthetic characteristics and potato yield under alkaline salt stress.

“Cell factory” strategy based on microbial anabolism pathways offers an intriguing alternative to relieve the dependence on fossil fuels, which are recognized as the main sources of CO2 emission. Typically, anabolism of intracellular substance in cell factory requires the consumption of sufficient reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). However, it is of great challenge to modify the natural limited anabolism and to increase the insufficient level of NADPH and ATP to optimum concentrations without causing metabolic imbalance. Inspired by the natural photosynthesis process in which NADPH and ATP can both be produced through the coupled electron‐proton transfer processes driven by sunlight, herein we designed a light‐driven bionic system composed of three modules including photo‐induced electron module, electron transfer channel module and proton gradient module. The proposed strategy of light‐driven bionic system enables for achieving simultaneous and controllable supplies of NADPH and ATP, thus facilitating both highly efficient CO2 fixation and biomanufacturing. The proposed light‐driven bionic system design strategy in this work might pave new sustainable ways for reducing power and energy regeneration to optimize microbial metabolism, offering intriguing alternatives for CO2 emission reduction and high value‐added chemical biomanufacturing.

Medical implant manufacturing is a growing sector and therefore requires improved manufacturing practices. In the case of total hip arthroplasty, the most challenging component to meet the ISO standard (ISO 7206-2:2011) is the acetabular liner, often made from ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). UHMWPE machining is associated with several manufacturing challenges, including swarf control. This research used low frequency vibration (LFV), an intermittent cutting process and supercritical CO2 (scCO2) to aid chip segmentation and prevent swarf nesting. Machining trials have demonstrated a significant reduction in swarf nesting relative to a traditional process (91% reduction from LFV and 98% reduction when using LFV and scCO2). The surface roughness (*Ra_Symbol*) also had an indirect improvement from using LFV (53% reduction on the inner hemisphere), leading to all parts meeting the roughness requirement of ISO 7206-2:2011. The results have demonstrated machinability benefits for UHMWPE, reducing the operator intervention required and component scrap rates.

This study examines the relationship between productive capacity and CO2 emissions in Algeria, addressing the pressing challenge of sustainable development in the context of climate change. The aim is to explore how enhancing production capacity can influence environmental outcomes, particularly in terms of carbon emissions. To achieve this, the study employs an Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model, with results validated through an Error Correction Model (ECM), using data from 1990 to 2023. The findings reveal that improvements in productive capacity contribute to a long-term reduction in CO2 emissions per capita. However, an increase in energy consumption has the potential to undermine these gains, underlining the need for greater energy efficiency. Key policy recommendations suggest prioritizing investments in energy-efficient technologies, thereby enhancing Algeria’s productive capacity while minimizing environmental impact. This framework provides a valuable pathway for aligning economic growth with sustainable environmental practices, offering actionable insights for policymakers aiming to balance development with climate goals.

Greenhouse gas emission from ships is currently one of the environmental issues for the shipping industry. Considering the marine air conditioning system consumes much energy on board ships, and to improve its efficiency and thus reduce CO2 emission, an ice thermal energy storage (ICE-TES) unit was designed and integrated into a marine air conditioning system on a real ship. Four cases distinguished with the shaved peak value of cooling load as 4%, 8%, 12%, and 16% were analyzed, and with the increasing shaving percent the integration of ICE-TES unit could reduce more electricity consumed for air cooling, and a upmost reduction of 1.49% was achieved (saved fuel by 33.99 kg/day). Furthermore, the rated power of compressor was optimized subsequently, the corresponding average COP of the system was enhanced from 2.36 to 2.45, and the saving in electricity consumption was promoted to 5.23% (saved fuel by 95.53 kg/day). Environmental analysis showed that CO2 emission was reduced by up to 2.84%, and the payback period for the optimized system could be shortened to 2.50 years. Thus this study proves the feasibility of the integration of ICE-TES unit with central air conditioning systems specifically for marine applications.

The present study investigates experimental cooling from the ceiling using phase change materials (PCMs) in Yazd, a city characterized by a hot and dry climate. A one-fourth scale model of a real room, measuring 4 m × 3 m × 3 m, was employed for the analysis. To evaluate system performance and the impact of PCM on energy consumption reduction, three configurations were considered: a simple PCM system, a PCM system with a fan (PCM-F), and a PCM system with a mini cooler (PCM-C). Additionally, to assess the influence of window configurations on ventilation, temperature, and comfort conditions within the model, three scenarios were examined: two open windows, one open window, and no windows. The economic analysis compared the two systems with the fan and mini cooler against a full mechanical cooling system without PCMs. Furthermore, CO2 emissions and environmental impacts associated with the systems were also evaluated. The results indicate that the presence of PCMs in the ceiling, due to heat absorption during phase change, leads to a temperature reduction of 5 to 10 °C in the ceiling and a 3.2 °C reduction in the average room temperature compared to the scenario without PCMs. The findings demonstrate that ceiling cooling with PCMs significantly contributes to energy consumption reduction during peak hours of cooling demand. Specifically, the PCM-F system results in a 92% reduction, and the PCM-C system leads to a 71% reduction in total cost compared to the reference mechanical cooling system. Additionally, the PCM-F system achieves approximately a 36% reduction, and the PCM-C system results in a 34% reduction in environmental impact relative to the reference full mechanical cooling system.

Summary Low-frequency laboratory measurements provide direct access to the elastic properties of samples within the seismic frequency band, offering calibration data for seismic survey analysis. Additionally, ÂµCT imaging can quantify actual saturations and provides insights into phase distributions at the pore scale. To conduct laboratory triaxial measurements at seismic frequencies while simultaneously imaging the rock interior, we developed an X-ray transparent low-frequency apparatus. Our apparatus determines rock mechanical properties at seismic frequencies (0.5â&#x80;&#x93;150 Hz) and strain amplitudes (10−7â&#x80;&#x93;10−5), measuring Youngâ&#x80;&#x99;s modulus, Poissonâ&#x80;&#x99;s ratio, and attenuation. In addition P- and S-wave velocities at ultrasonic frequencies are measured. We conducted imbibition-drainage experiments to assess the effect of saturation and patch size on seismic and ultrasonic elastic properties in sandstone. Additional tests with liquid and gaseous CO2 reveal the impact of partial CO2-gas saturation. The imbibition-drainage experiment demonstrated that P-wave velocity at ultrasonic frequencies was elevated during drainage and reduced during imbibition. Drainage caused patchy saturation, while imbibition resulted in uniform saturation. This implies that ultrasonic measurements, with wavelengths comparable to the pore fluid patch size, are likely influenced by scattering. In contrast, low-frequency measurements, where the wavelength surpasses the patch size, capture effective medium properties and therefore are not affected by scattering effects. The results of the CO2 test suggest that low-frequency measurements can detect even low gas saturations (4% gaseous CO2). In contrast, ultrasonic velocity measurements primarily reflect the response of the fully saturated sample at low gas saturations and do not indicate a reduction in velocity. Identifying fluid-solid interactions and estimating saturation via ÂµCT imaging is crucial, especially with minimal gas presence. Our combined approach allows precise determination of elastic properties at seismic frequencies and shows the importance of low-frequency over ultrasonic measurements.

Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a typical two-dimensional (2D) material acclaimed for its layered structure and electronic properties, showcasing promise across various domains such as catalysis, CO2 reduction, and lubrication. In this study, g-C3N4 is synthesized as an oil-based nanoadditive within oleic acid (OA), exhibiting superlow friction coefficient (COF) within steel/steel contacts under high pressure. When dispersed g-C3N4 in OA at a concentration of 0.25 wt %, the COF is reduced from 0.077 to 0.022 compared to the base oil. The amino groups in g-C3N4 promote the formation of continuous friction films, creating a composite tribofilm made of carbon layers, carbon nitride, and iron oxides. This tribofilm effectively prevents direct contact between tribopairs, leading to significant friction reduction and enhanced antiwear properties. These findings offer insights into the design of lubricant additives for base oils and highlight the promising potential of carbon nitride in lubrication and tribology applications.

A clean fuel standard (CFS) is a regulatory instrument that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the use of transportation fuel. It establishes a lifecycle emissions benchmark (the 'compliance schedule') against which fuels may be rewarded or penalized. This paper explains the CFS mechanism and examines the prospects for a national CFS in the USA that covers road and aviation segments. We introduce the CFS Scenario Compliance Model (CSCM), and two ambitious scenarios of transportation decarbonization which are consistent with an economy that reaches net zero emissions in 2050. Our 'High-ZEV' scenario is characterized by rapid transition of the vehicle fleet, while the 'High-Liquid' scenario emphasizes rapid scale-up of next-generation fuel production. These scenarios achieve a 87-94% reduction in road transportation carbon intensity by 2050. In addition, we model an ~84% reduction for aviation fuel (this includes carbon removals, but excludes the climate impact of aviation's non-CO2 emissions). Policy considerations for the design of a national CFS in the USA include the ambition of target-setting, investment support, and use of feedstock caps to mitigate sustainability risks. Cross-sectoral linkages mean that target-setting in transportation policy should be coupled with transitions towards renewable electricity and climate-efficient farming practices.

This study was aimed at assessing the effectiveness of design solutions for the development of Kyiv’s transport infrastructure based on transport modelling and analysis of possible socio-economic effects. To do this, a four-step algorithm for modelling transport demand was used, based on data from sociological surveys, territory plans, and forecasts for 2030. The results of the study showed significant changes in the functioning of the Kyiv transport network as a result of the implementation of the proposed design solutions. The transport modelling helped to estimate quantitative indicators such as traffic volumes on major highways, as well as qualitative changes such as reduced congestion, shorter travel times, and cost savings. One of the key results was that the opening of new exits and entrances to the Darnytskyi Bridge on the left bank contributed to a slight increase in bridge capacity, but the biggest effect was seen on the approaches to the bridge. The additional approaches have increased traffic volumes, which indicates improved transport accessibility for drivers using this transport hub. The results related to environmental performance were also important. The reduction in congestion resulted in a reduction in CO2 emissions, which is a significant contribution to improving the environmental situation in the city. In terms of cost-effectiveness, the results demonstrated significant savings in transport losses, confirming that the implementation of the proposed measures has a positive impact on transport infrastructure, as well as reducing financial losses associated with travel. Thus, the results of the study confirmed that the proposed design solutions have a positive impact on the development of the transport network, increasing capacity and reducing negative environmental impact, which opens up opportunities for creating a more efficient transport system that meets the requirements of sustainable development and improves the overall quality of life of Kyiv residents

Abstract. Fire is regarded as an essential climate variable, emitting greenhouse gases in the combustion process. Current global assessments of fire emissions traditionally rely on coarse remotely sensed burned-area data, along with biome-specific combustion completeness and emission factors (EFs). However, large uncertainties persist regarding burned areas, biomass affected, and emission factors. Recent increases in resolution have improved previous estimates of burned areas and aboveground biomass while increasing the information content used to derive emission factors, complemented by airborne sensors deployed in the tropics. To date, temperate forests, characterized by a lower fire incidence and stricter aerial surveillance restrictions near wildfires, have received less attention. In this study, we leveraged the distinctive fire season of 2022, which impacted western European temperate forests, to investigate fire emissions monitored by the atmospheric tower network. We examined the role of soil smoldering combustion responsible for higher carbon emissions, locally reported by firefighters but not accounted for in temperate fire emission budgets. We assessed the CO/CO2 ratio released by major fires in the Mediterranean, Atlantic pine, and Atlantic temperate forests of France. Our findings revealed low modified combustion efficiency (MCE) for the two Atlantic temperate regions, supporting the assumption of heavy smoldering combustion. This type of combustion was associated with specific fire characteristics, such as long-lasting thermal fire signals, and affected ecosystems encompassing needle leaf species, peatlands, and superficial lignite deposits in the soils. Thanks to high-resolution data (approximately 10 m) on burned areas, tree biomass, peatlands, and soil organic matter (SOM), we proposed a revised combustion emission framework consistent with the observed MCEs. Our estimates revealed that 6.15 Mt CO2 (±2.65) was emitted, with belowground stock accounting for 51.75 % (±16.05). Additionally, we calculated a total emission of 1.14 Mt CO (±0.61), with 84.85 % (±3.75) originating from belowground combustion. As a result, the carbon emissions from the 2022 fires in France amounted to 7.95 MtCO2-eq (±3.62). These values exceed by 2-fold the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) estimates for the country, reaching 4.18 MtCO2-eq (CO and CO2). Fires represent 1.97 % (±0.89) of the country's annual carbon footprint, corresponding to a reduction of 30 % in the forest carbon sink this year. Consequently, we conclude that current European fire emission estimates should be revised to account for soil combustion in temperate forests. We also recommend the use of atmospheric mixing ratios as an effective monitoring system of prolonged soil fires that have the potential to re-ignite in the following weeks.

Densely populated urban megacities, such as the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City, face the ongoing deterioration of air quality. Emissions from industrail factories and internal combustion vehicles are the main sources of pollutants. We have evaluated different transition trends from internal combustion engine vehicles as bus, truck and van, and motorcycle to electric vehicles through 2050. The total vehicle growth follows a second-degree polynomial trend. Bus growth exhibits a linear trend. Truck and van growth display a second-degree polynomial trend. Motorcycle growth also follows a second-degree polynomial trend. We found that the most significant reductions in transportation emissions are observed in CO2, followed by NOx, volatile organic compound (VOC), and particulate matter, with light and heavy vehicles being the primary contributors to total emissions. Mexico City serves as a pilot laboratory where both the challenges and potential solutions to an issue affecting millions of citizens can be observed. If proven effective and practical, these solutions could be applied to other megacities.

In this study, a highly efficient metal-free catalyst derived supported on coal-based carbon aerogel was successfully synthesized for the two-electron transfer oxygen reduction reaction (2e– ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The catalyst, with its high specific surface area and hierarchical porous structure, demonstrated exceptional selectivity for H2O2 under alkaline conditions. By optimization of the synthesis and drying conditions, particularly through the use of supercritical drying technology, the physicochemical properties and selectivity of the catalyst were significantly enhanced. Notably, the coal-based carbon gel obtained through supercritical drying with CO2 exhibited the superior specific surface area over 1311 m2·g–1. The H2O2 selectivity over 95% at a potential of 0.5 V vs SHE was obtained using the catalyst material synthesized from this study. It was also revealed that the high selectivity was attributed to the layered edge active sites, which are rich in carbonyl (C=O) and carboxyl (COOH) groups. In situ FTIR and Raman spectroscopic analyses confirmed the two-electron-transfer ORR reaction mechanism from this study.

The current work presents the flame-retardant performance of hybrid polypropylene composites, reinforced with specific short woven flax fabrics (SWFs), short basalt fibers (BFs), and rice husk powder (RHP), using polypropylene grafted maleic anhydride (MAPP) as the coupling agent. Horizontal burning test (HBT), microcalorimeter test (MCT), and cone calorimeter test (CCT) were conducted on these composites. The formulations used were 25% SWF/PP, 25% SWF/20% BF/PP, and 25% SWF/20% BF/PP with 6% RHP and 25% SWF/20% BF/PP with varying RHP contents (6, 12, and 18%) in combination with 6% MAPP. A peak heat release rate (pHRR) reduction of 14.42% was recorded in microcalorimeter test results. However, cone calorimeter test results indicated a reduction of 80.95% in pHRR and 23.84% in total heat release rate (THR). Furthermore, the emissions of CO and CO2 were reduced by 68 and 67%, respectively, in the 25SWF/20BF/PP.6MAPP-18RHP composite compared to pure PP, indicating an overall improvement in combustion efficiency. Fire performance index (FPI) also improved remarkably: FPI increased by 130% and fire growth index (FGI) improved by 81.34%. Moreover, the horizontal burning test showed an improved performance, with the burning rate further reduced by 11.10% compared to that of the 25% SWF/PP composite. These results highlight the synergy among natural fibers, agro-waste fillers, and MAPP in improving flame retardancy of polypropylene composites, and hence their potential application in automobiles and construction, where the demand for fire safety is very high.

Abstract This study examines how Climate-Related Financial Policies (CRFPs) support decarbonization and renewable energy transitions across 87 countries from 2000 to 2023. Using the Policy Sequencing Score (PSS) and a bindingness-weighted adoption indicator, it explores the relationships between CRFPs, CO2 emissions, and Renewable Energy Production (REP) across diverse economic and institutional contexts. Findings reveal significant variation in outcomes. Advanced economies and OECD countries leverage structured policies and robust institutions to achieve steady emissions reductions and REP growth, with diminishing returns at higher policy intensities. Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) face institutional and structural constraints but show strong responsiveness to targeted policies, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where renewable energy growth potential is notable. Regions such as Latin America and East Asia display mixed trends, reflecting unique challenges and opportunities. Binding policies prove essential for environmental outcomes, particularly in institutionalized settings, while EMDEs require capacity building and international cooperation to address barriers. This study highlights the importance of tailoring CRFPs to specific contexts, emphasizing policy sequencing, enforcement, and capacity building. By identifying global and regional variations, the findings provide actionable insights for aligning financial systems with climate goals, fostering a sustainable low-carbon transition, and addressing equity challenges.

Greenhouse gas emissions are primary drivers of climate change, and the intensification of extreme heat and urban heat island effects poses serious threats to urban ecosystems, public health, and energy consumption. This study systematically evaluated the carbon reduction potential of 369 urban parks in Jinan during extreme heat events using land surface temperature (LST) retrieval, combined with CatBoost + SHAP machine learning methods. Results indicate that the LST in Jinan ranged from 1.77 °C to 59.44 °C, and 278 parks exhibited significant cooling effects, collectively saving 2943 tons of CO2 per day—offsetting 11.28% of the city’s fossil fuel emissions. Small parks, such as community parks, demonstrated higher carbon-saving efficiency (CSE), while large ecological parks showed greater carbon-saving intensity (CSI). CSE was strongly correlated with vegetation coverage and surrounding population density, with efficiency increasing when the vegetation index was within 0.3–0.7 and population density ranged 0–5000 or 15,000–22,500 people. CSI was influenced by evapotranspiration and park geometric form, increasing significantly when the park area exceeded 250 hectares or evapotranspiration ranged 2.5–6.0. However, elevation and albedo negatively impacted both metrics, with the lowest CSI observed when elevation exceeded 150 m or albedo surpassed 18%.

Microplastics pose a serious ecological threat to agricultural soils, as they are very persistent in nature. Microplastics can enter the soil system in different ways and present different shapes and concentrations. However, little is known about how plants react to microplastics with different concentrations and shapes. To this end, we conducted a factorial pot experiment with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in which we mixed polystyrene (PS) in different shapes (bead, fiber and powder) with soil at concentrations of 0, 1, 3 and 5%. Although all shapes of PS significantly reduced morphological growth traits, PS in powder shape was the microplastic that reduced plant height (by 58–60%), fresh biomass (by 54–55%) and dry biomass (by 61–62%) the most, especially at the 3% and 5% concentrations compared with 0% PS. Similar negative effects were also observed for root length and fresh root weight at the 3% and 5% concentrations, regardless of shape. A concentration-dependent reduction in the leaf area index (LAI) was also observed. Interestingly, increasing the PS concentration tended to up-regulate the activity of antioxidant enzymes for all shapes, indicating potential complexity and a highly time-dependent response related to various reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, PS at the 5% concentration caused a significant reduction in chlorophyll pigmentation and photosynthetic rate. For the transpiration rate, stomatal conductance and intercellular CO2 concentration, the negative effects of PS on wheat plants increased with the increase in microplastic concentration for all shapes of PS. Overall, we concluded that PS microplastics at higher concentrations are potentially more devastating to the physiological growth and biochemical attributes of wheat, as evidenced by the negative effects on photosynthetic pigments and gas exchange parameters for all shapes. We recommend further research experiments not only on translocation but also on tissue-specific retention of different sizes in crops to fully understand their impact on food safety.

The purpose of the article is to analyze the experience of the functioning of the green economy in individual countries of the world. On the example of the USA, Sweden, Costa Rica and Ukraine, the existing global trends in the field of green economy were considered. In the United States, during the study period (1990–2022), the share of renewable sources increased from 11.8% to 21.5%. In Sweden, more than 50% of energy is produced from renewable energy sources, and the country’s government aims to completely abandon nuclear energy by 2040 and switch to 100% renewable energy generation. The largest share of energy production in Costa Rica comes from low-carbon energy sources. A significant problem in the field of the green economy of Costa Rica can be defined as the situation with plastic waste. From 1991 to 2022, Ukraine managed to reduce CO2 emissions by almost 80%; the production of energy from renewable sources increased (in 2021, 14% of production). The efficiency of waste processing was at a low level even before the war: as of 2021, only 7% of all waste was recycled. The war disrupted Ukraine’s existing plans to develop a green economy; the energy infrastructure, including the green components, was damaged. However, Ukraine has prospects for the development of a green economy, given that the recovery and reconstruction of the country will take place with the choice of environmental alternatives. In addition, potential accession to the European Union will require compliance with the current EU regulations in the field of emission reduction and improvement of recycling systems. The prospects for the development of the green economy in the world depend on the action of interrelated factors, including: the development of the energy sector, since renewable energy sources are one of the main priorities for most countries; the emergence of new technologies and the constant improvement of existing ones for the purpose of sorting and processing of secondary raw materials; the incentive policy on the part of the State, which includes legislation, regulations, directives, standards related to various aspects of the development of the green economy. Thus, it can be noted that the world has formed a trend of purposeful policy to support the development of the green economy.

Context & scaleAlthough most people born this century will be educated in African schools, these schools often lack basic infrastructure, such as electricity and/or lighting. In the face of a rapidly growing school-age population in Africa, the electrification of educational facilities is not just an infrastructural challenge but also a pivotal investment in the continent's future workforce. This study reveals a stark reality: a third of Africa's school-aged children are nearer to schools without electricity, impacting educational quality and access. By mapping over half a million schools across the continent, this research underscores the transformative potential of decentralized solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Not only could solar PV reduce travel times for millions of students, but it also promises the improvement of reliable services and a significant reduction in CO2 emissions. The strategic electrification of schools could catalyze a myriad of co-benefits, including enhancing educational outcomes, economic prosperity, and environmental sustainability. All this contributes to the achievement of multiple Sustainable Development Goals across the continent.Highlights•Comprehensive data of over half a million geolocated schools in Africa provided•PV systems offer clean, reliable, and cost-effective electricity access in schools•2 billion EUR investment needed to bring electricity to schools•Electricity can provide e-cooking, and internet services, and reduce travel time by 45 minSummaryAfrica's schools will educate the majority of the 21st century's working population, influencing the global economy. Through combined spatial analysis techniques on over 500,000 schools, we estimate a 2 billion EUR cost to power unelectrified schools with decentralized solar photovoltaic systems. Given the positive effect on children's food security and the growing need for digitalization, ensuring clean electricity access includes both electricity demand for internet connectivity and electric cooking. Our analysis reveals that 32% of African school-aged children live near unelectrified schools, with the nearest electrified school often too far away. The electrification of these facilities would reduce education-seeking trips by an average 45 min by motorized transport or 6 h on foot. This significant time savings, combined with the broader benefits of decentralized energy, can significantly enhance educational access, economic development, and environmental sustainability in Africa.Graphical abstract

Since the launch of the journal in 2016, we have built an enthusiastic energy community of authors, reviewers and readers. Their continued support has helped us to build a top-tier journal to disseminate new advances in energy research and discuss important scientific issues from the laboratory to the real world.We are pleased to engage with the passionate members of the scientific community who have made impressive progress in recent years to address clean energy challenges. The desire to reduce the carbon footprint has led to many innovative strategies to adopt renewable energy technologies. For example, perovskite solar cells, which showed an increase in efficiency from 14.1% in 2013 to 26.7% in 2024, are now being targeted for large-scale panel production. Si-perovskite-based tandem solar cells have made significant strides, reaching a record efficiency of 34.6%. Similarly, storage batteries have emerged from table-top devices to grid storage, and electrocatalysis is driving CO2 reduction on a pilot plant scale. The next phase of energy research is likely to be dominated with topics such as device stability of solar cells, display devices and electrolyzers, for long-term operation, fast charging of storage batteries, and recycling strategies for solar cells and storage batteries. Fundamental studies exploring properties of new materials for energy conversion and storage, and a better understanding of interfacial charge transfer processes in various devices (e.g., solar cells, storage batteries and LEDs), will also see a major growth in research.The growth of ACS Energy Letters during its first ten years can be seen from the increase in number of published articles as well as their growing impact (Figure 1). In addition to Letters, Perspectives and Reviews, we regularly publish Viewpoints and Energy Focus articles. These features offer our authors a unique opportunity to engage in scientific discussions. We also regularly feature Collections that compile key papers on an emerging topic. Each year, we also highlight contributions of women scientists along with their inspiring thoughts.

Shale gas has become increasingly significant in the global energy supply. Mineral heterogeneity in shales importantly impacts gas transport within the shale matrix and therefore the depletion history curve. A microscale discrete coupling model is introduced to clarify mass transfer and mechanical interactions, as well as their impact on gas transport properties, ranging from individual mineral through ensemble field scale. The model uses a mineral morphology thin-section obtained through tescan integrated mineral analyzer with the mechanical parameters, controlling both elastic and viscosity behavior of each mineral, achieved through nanoindentation. A coupled model for poromechanical evolution is proposed and solved using COMSOL. The applicability of the model results are validated against field data using a dimensionless approach. This confirms that in the early stages of gas depletion, gas is primarily liberated from inorganic minerals, whereas in later stages, it is predominantly sourced from adsorbed gas from the organic matter. Over time, the permeability of the inorganic minerals decreases, and a higher Young's modulus of the minerals results in a greater ultimate permeability ratio. Evolution of the effective diffusion coefficient for the organic matter is controlled by multiple components. A negative correlation exists between mineral grain size and the creep effects, indicating that larger grain sizes result in smaller creep magnitudes during gas production. The Young's modulus of inorganic matter is inversely correlated with the diffusion coefficient, while an increase in the Young's modulus in the organic matter corresponds to a higher diffusion coefficient. The proposed model complements the traditional continuum dual-medium method and provides a clearer understanding of the interactions between minerals during gas depletion behavior.
