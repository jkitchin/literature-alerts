Abstract Functional nanoporous materials are considered a significant category of nanostructured materials that exhibit distinct characteristics like high surface area, porosity, and improved mass transport properties. These qualities render them suitable for a wide range of applications including catalysis, energy storage, biomedical fields, and electrochemical sensors. Dealloying or laser-induced technologies are the primary methods employed to fabricate such nanoporous materials. Dealloying is a dependable top-down approach used to produce hierarchical, disordered nanoporous materials with customizable pore sizes in the range of a few nanometers. The process of dealloying involves the selective elimination or dissolution of one or more elements from an alloy through a corrosion mechanism, using various dealloying techniques, such as chemical, electrochemical, liquid metal, or vapor phase dealloying. In the present study, copper-based amorphous metallic ribbons (Cu75Ni6Sn5P10Ga4) were initially manufactured using the melt-spinning method. The Cu-based amorphous ribbons were structurally investigated by X-ray diffraction and thermal analysis. Subsequently, the ribbons were subjected to a dealloying treatment, using an acidic solution to selectively dissolve the nickel from their composition and to obtain a nanoporous structure. The microstructure and chemical composition of the ribbons before and after the dealloying process were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The dealloying process performed in 1 M H2SO4 solution at 25 °C for 60 minutes leads to a large number of nanopores, uniformly distributed onto the surface of the Cu-based ribbons.

(1−3) Professor Haoshen Zhou from Nanjing University, China, has been selected as the 2024 PIER in the field of batteries and energy storage for his outstanding contribution to the area of high energy density secondary battery materials and systems. (4) We are honored to have the opportunity to celebrate his outstanding contributions in this special issue (SI).Professor Haoshen Zhou received his bachelor's degree in semiconductor physics from the Department of Physics at Nanjing University in 1985, master's degree in 1988 from the Nanjing Institute of Electronic Devices, and Ph.D. in chemical engineering in the School of Engineering at The University of Tokyo, Japan, in 1994. After his Ph.D. study, he pursued a further 3 years of postdoctoral training at RIKEN in Japan. In 1997, Professor Haoshen Zhou joined the Energy Interface Department of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, to pursue energy-related scientific research. He was promoted to a professor-level senior researcher in 2004 and became the chief senior researcher in AIST's Energy Department in 2011. During his tenure in Japan, Professor Zhou led numerous projects funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), and the Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO). In 2012, he joined Nanjing University's College of Engineering and Applied Sciences as a full professor. Professor Zhou established the Department of Energy Science and Engineering and Center of Energy Storage Materials & Technology, where he served as their inaugural chairs. He was also appointed as a Yangtse Distinguished Professor by the Chinese Ministry of Education (2010). He held concurrent appointments as a special professor at The University of Tokyo and University of Tsukuba in Japan. Professor Zhou has served as an associate editor of Science Bulletin and Energy Storage Materials as well as an expert in charge of the National Key R&D Program's "Smart Grid Key Project" in China. During 2014–2018, he was the chief scientist for China's National Key Research Program in Nanotechnology. Professor Zhou received the "Lihua Yi" Chemical Innovation Award from the Chinese Chemical Society (2023) and the First Prize from the Chinese Materials Research Society (2024). Over his career, Professor Zhou has mentored more than 80 postdoctoral fellows and doctoral students, of which many have grown into emerging leaders in their respective research areas.Professor Haoshen Zhou has long been dedicated to the innovation and engineering of new high-energy-density battery systems and key materials. He established the reaction theory for high-capacity air electrodes, invented solid-state batteries based on sieving electrolytes, and developed and expanded the combined electrolyte battery system. As a corresponding author, he has published over 500 research papers and is a holder of over 80 authorized patents. Professor Zhou is a pioneer in the field of lithium–oxygen batteries, proposed a comprehensive mechanism for oxygen anion redox energy storage, and designed new high-energy-density lithium batteries. (5−9) Zhou and his team creatively introduced the "Li2O–Li2O2" oxygen anion redox process for charge storage, offering advantages such as high coulombic efficiency, good reversibility, and mild stability for the battery system. (6) He also discovered the critical role of trace amounts of H2O in enhancing the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) processes in organic electrolytes, proposing a synergistic catalytic mechanism between H2O molecules and Ru/SP/MnO2 cathodes, leading to breakthrough in lithium–air batteries. (7) Building upon the oxygen anion redox energy storage mechanism, he designed various highly efficient catalysts (e.g., Ir and Ni) to expand the reversible capacity of the cathode and suppress oxygen evolution. (6,8) Professor Zhou also proposed a concentrated dual-salt LiFSI–LiNO3/DOL electrolyte to improve the high-rate performance of lithium metal anodes, delivering stable operation for 240 cycles at 8.0 mA cm–2 and an average coulombic efficiency of 99.14%. (9) He also invented a closed lithium–oxygen battery with a lithium metal anode and high-capacity Li2O cathode, achieving a practical specific energy of 513 Wh kg–1 and a charge–discharge cycle life exceeding 200 cycles. (8) Professor Zhou summarized the essential criteria for redox mediators (RMs) to function as catalysts in lithium–air batteries and revealed the catalytic mechanism of these soluble catalysts during the charging process: (1) 2RM– + 2e– = 2RM+ and (2) 2RM+ + Li2O2 = 2Li+ + O2 + 2RM. (10) This theory led to his pioneering use of trichloroethyl chloroformate (TCCF) as a soluble catalyst for not only significantly reducing the overpotential of the OER but also greatly enhancing the reaction rate of the oxygen electrode. (11) The innovation improved the rate performance of lithium–oxygen batteries by over 10 times, with the cathode achieving a discharge specific capacity of 2005 mAh g–1 at a current density of 1 A g–1.Professor Haoshen Zhou has also made groundbreaking contributions to the study of lithium–carbon dioxide (Li–CO2) batteries, high-energy-density batteries without lithium anodes, and development of new battery systems. He introduced in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to the study of CO2 electrode reactions, proposing the reaction mechanism for the reversible reduction and evolution of CO2 at the air electrode interface: 3CO2 + 4e– + 4Li+ = 2Li2CO3 + C. (12) He further introduced molten salt electrolytes, which verified the reversible reaction pathway of CO2 at the air electrode, reduced the electrode overpotential, and significantly improved the energy storage efficiency of the battery. (13) Professor Zhou and his team were the first to propose a lithium supplementation mechanism based on the OER of Li2O, successfully addressing the issue of capacity degradation caused by lithium loss during charge and discharge cycles. (14) A prototype anode-free lithium-ion battery with a layered transition metal oxide cathode was designed and operated, achieving a specific energy of 320 Wh kg–1 and a cycle life of 300 cycles. Professor Zhou also creatively introduced the concept of a combined electrolyte, constructed from "organic electrolytes", "lithium-ion solid electrolytes", and "aqueous electrolytes", integrating the characteristics of two or more electrolytes to design multiple energy conversion systems, leading to the invention of a high-capacity lithium–air battery and a technology for directly extracting elemental lithium from seawater. (15) The pioneering concept of combined electrolytes further led to the demonstration of an electrolytic cell system that has achieved both lithium extraction from seawater (or brine) and conversion of electrical energy into the chemical energy of lithium as a new energy storage solution. (16)Professor Zhou and his team further expanded the concept of combined electrolytes to integrate molecular sieves or framework compounds with organic electrolytes for successfully mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions on the anode surface, enhancing the stability of high-capacity lithium secondary batteries at high voltages (greater than 5.2 V versus Li/Li+) and elevated temperatures (100 °C). (17) This achievement is significant for expanding the application scenarios of electrolytes in high-output voltage systems and improving the energy density of various battery configurations. Professor Zhou then introduced the Cu3(BTC)2 metal–organic framework (MOF) as a selective electrolyte in lithium–sulfur battery systems for effectively preventing polysulfide ions from shuttling to the lithium metal side, significantly reducing capacity loss with an average capacity decay of only 0.019% over 1500 cycles. (18) He also invented a polypropylene ultrathin membrane modified with MOFs that greatly enhances the cycle life of lithium metal battery systems while increasing energy density, achieving a specific energy of 354 Wh kg–1 and 80% retention of its initial capacity after 200 cycles. (19)To celebrate the achievement of Professor Zhou as one of the 2024 PIERs, Energy & Fuels is also pleased to present this SI that includes a collection of 41 invited papers (22 reviews, 18 articles, and 1 communication), contributed by some invited leading as well as early to mid-career authors in the related energy field.

(10.1021/acs.energyfuels.4c01001)articleLithium-Ion BatteriesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!A total of 11 papers (5 reviews and 6 articles) are on lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Electrolytes, a critical component of batteries, play a pivotal role in promoting ionic and charge transport and forming a solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI). Chang et al. reviewed the characteristics and commonalities of different electrolyte formulations. Inspiring methods to further optimize electrolyte compositions and structures based on novel solvents for practical LIBs are also proposed. (20) Yu et al. reviewed scientific challenges, design strategies, action mechanisms, and latest progresses of ethylene carbonate (EC)-free electrolytes in high-energy-density LIBs. The design principle, advantages, and disadvantages of each electrolyte (carbonate, fluorinate, sulfone, and nitrile based) and their functions are discussed in detail. (21) Feng et al. summarized the available technologies for recycling LIBs and addressed the advantages and disadvantages of different processes. Some scientific challenges and perspectives for recycling and reutilizing spent LIBs as efficient catalysts are also put forward. (22) Wang et al. summarized the latest advancements in lithium hydride dendrite research, discussed the prevailing controversies, and outlined future perspectives in the field. (23) Wang et al. provided a comprehensive overview of recent advances in developing MXenes and their hybrids as flexible electrodes for advanced LIBs; this includes the synthesis, characterization, and structural modification of MXene-based materials and their ability to improve electrochemical performance from the viewpoint of fundamental to various applications. (24) Liu et al. prepared a porous V2CTx-encapsulated liquid GaInSn alloy as an anode for LIBs, which demonstrated excellent electrochemical performance at wide temperatures. Olivine LiMnPO4 cathode materials are favored for their low cost and higher operating voltage compared to those of LiFePO4. (25) He et al. prepared LiMnxFe1–xPO4/C (x = 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9) cathode materials by solid-state reaction and performed better in cyclic stability, rate capability, and capacity retention. (26) It is a huge challenge to overcome the dissolution problem for cathode materials, especially for small-molecule organic cathode materials (SMOCMs). Song et al. investigated a commercially available vat dye, namely, flavanthrone, directly as a novel SMOCM for rechargeable lithium batteries. It possesses a low solubility benefiting from the extensive aromatic system and a high theoretical capacity based on the four electroactive C═O/C═N groups. (27) Chen et al. prepared a dense Li4Ti5O12 single-particle microelectrode, and its electrochemical properties are measured over a wide voltage window in LIBs, which delivered an ultralow-potential discharge plateau. (28) Konkena et al. demonstrated the liquid-phase exfoliation of non-layered, bulk As4S4 material to produce quasi-two-dimensional (2D) platelets. The As4S4 anode with highly disordered, low aspect ratio quasi-2D platelets exhibits commendable performance for both Li-ion and Na-ion storage. (29) Bai et al. demonstrated an in situ self-assembly strategy where metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) grew on a polypropylene separator. This MOF-based separator achieves permselective ion transport and regulation behavior, which effectively suppresses the nucleation and growth of Li dendrites. (30)Sodium-Ion BatteriesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!A total of 7 papers (3 reviews and 4 articles) are on sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). SIBs have great potential for large-scale energy storage devices due to the high abundance, wide distribution, and non-toxicity of the resource. Li et al. reviewed the phase transition in layered oxide cathodes, pointing out the intrinsic causes and degradation mechanisms of phase transition for SIBs. They summarize the mainstream strategies to inhibit the phase transition, such as elemental doping, surface coating, and structural modification as well as the novel strategy of introducing anionic redox, providing new comprehension in understanding the phase transition of layered oxides. (31) Wang et al. presented a thorough discussion of the current research progress on layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) beginning with an explanation of the structure characteristics of P- and O-phase cathode materials. Three primary modification strategies are outlined to address the challenges faced by LTMOs: element doping, surface coating, and structure design. (32) Li et al. collated recent advances and fundamental design principles of organic electrolytes in terms of sodium salts, solvents, and functional additives. They also discuss the crucial challenges for SIBs, including high operating voltage, wide working temperature range, and fast charge rate. The corresponding solution strategies are introduced for the desired organic electrolytes in high-performance SIBs. (33) Guo et al. employed an entropy strategy for stabilizing O′3-NaMn0.8Mg0.06Ti0.06Fe0.04Al0.04O2 (NMO-MTFA)-layered cathodes for SIBs, which not only stabilized the crystal structure but also enhanced both the bulk and surface/interface kinetics. (34) Qian et al. developed Se-doped CNFs with rationally integrated BiSb nanocrystals as anode materials for SIBs/potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), presenting a promising pathway for fabricating innovative transition metal dichalcogenide electrode materials. (35) Chen et al. synthesized a composite carbon material with a rich closed-pore structure and a mass of long-range ordered soft carbon phase as a highly efficient anode material for SIBs. This hard–soft composite carbon material features plenty of closed pores, which facilitates the storage of sodium ions and endows anodes with high-energy and reversible low-potential plateaus (<0.1 V). (36) Cao et al. conducted a systematic study of the evolutionary mechanism of microcrystalline carbon using lignin and cellulose as models, providing theoretical guidance for the design of high-performance biomass-derived hard carbon for SIBs. (37)Zinc-Ion BatteriesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!A total of 3 papers (1 review and 2 articles) are on zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). ZIBs are viewed as promising grid-level energy storage solutions due to their high theoretical specific capacity (820 Ah kg–1 and 5855 Ah L–1), low electrochemical potential, ample geological resources, and compatibility with water. Zhang et al. comprehensively overviewed the functional role of the electrolyte additive in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs), including regulating the solvation structure, altering the H-bond network, forming an adsorption layer, generating an electrostatic shielding effect, and constructing a solid electrolyte interphase. The development prospects and existing problems of additives are also presented. (38) Wang et al. introduced certain MnSO4 into the ZnSO4 + K2SO4 hybrid electrolyte (Zn0.5K0.25) to improve the AZIBs. MnSO4 in the hybrid electrolyte facilitates the porous MnO2 electrodeposition on PBAs, resulting in an increased contact area at the electrode/electrolyte interface, thereby accelerating the electrochemical reaction kinetics. (39) Yu et al. introduced a cost-effective copper sulfate additive, enabling the creation of a multifunctional Cu–Zn alloy solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the zinc anode. The SEI's superior electrical conductivity, zincophilic sites, ample free space, and elevated surface energy facilitate homogeneous Zn nucleation and deposition, thereby expediting electrochemical kinetics and mitigates dendrite formation.
