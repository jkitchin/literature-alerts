Abstract Hydrogen production through hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) offers a promising solution to combat climate change by replacing fossil fuels with clean energy sources. However, the widespread adoption of efficient electrocatalysts, such as platinum (Pt), has been hindered by their high cost. In this study, we developed an easy-to-implement method to create ultrathin Pt nanomembranes, which catalyze HER at a cost significantly lower than commercial Pt/C and comparable to non-noble metal electrocatalysts. These Pt nanomembranes consist of highly distorted Pt nanocrystals and exhibit a heterogeneous elastic strain field, a characteristic rarely seen in conventional crystals. This unique feature results in significantly higher electrocatalytic efficiency than various forms of Pt electrocatalysts, including Pt/C, Pt foils, and numerous Pt single-atom or single-cluster catalysts. Our research offers a promising approach to develop highly efficient and cost-effective low-dimensional electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production, potentially addressing the challenges posed by the climate crisis.

This work aims to address the challenge of developing interpretable ML-based models when access to large-scale computational resources is limited. Using CoMoFeNiCu high-entropy alloy catalysts as an example, we present a cost-effective workflow that synergistically combines descriptor-based approaches, machine learning-based force fields, and low-cost density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict high-quality adsorption energies for H, N, and NHx (x = 1, 2, and 3) adsorbates. This is achieved using three specific modifications to typical DFT workflows including: (1) using a sequential optimization protocol, (2) developing a new geometry-based descriptor, and (3) repurposing the already-available low-cost DFT optimization trajectories to develop a ML-FF. Taken together, this study illustrates how cost-effective DFT calculations and appropriately designed descriptors can be used to develop cheap but useful models for predicting high-quality adsorption energies at significantly lower computational costs. We anticipate that this resource-efficient philosophy may be broadly relevant to the larger surface catalysis community.

Unraveling the configuration–activity relationship and synergistic enhancement mechanism (such as real active center, electron spin-state, and d-orbital energy level) for triatomic catalysts, as well as their intrinsically bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis, is a great challenge. Here we present a triatomic catalyst (TAC) with a trinuclear active structure that displays extraordinary oxygen electrocatalysis for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), greatly outperforming the counterpart of single-atom and diatomic catalysts. The aqueous Zn-air battery (ZAB) equipped with a TAC-based cathode exhibits extraordinary rechargeable stability and ultrarobust cycling performance (1970 h/3940 cycles at 2 mA cm–2, 125 h/250 cycles at 10 mA cm–2 with negligible voltage decay), and the quasi-solid-state ZAB displays outstanding rechargeability and low-temperature adaptability (300 h/1800 cycles at 2 mA cm–2 at −60 °C), outperforming other state-of-the-art ZABs. The experimental and theoretical analyses reveal the symmetry-breaking CoN4 configuration under incorporation of neighboring metal atoms (Fe and Cu), which leads to d-orbital modulation, a low-shift d band center, weakened binding strength to the oxygen intermediates, and decreased energy barrier for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. This rational tricoordination design as well as an in-depth mechanism analysis indicate that hetero-TACs can be promisingly applied in various electrocatalysis applications.

The acceleration of materials discovery has gained paramount importance due to its potential to overcome constraints in emerging technologies. Extensive exploration has been undertaken into three pivotal approaches: combinatorial synthesis, high-throughput characterization, and computational techniques, all aimed at unveiling new materials. This review article delves into recent progress in these domains. Combinatorial synthesis, especially in the development of thin-film materials libraries, emerges as a potent method for efficiently generating comprehensive multinary materials systems and composition gradients spanning the entire spectrum of required compositions. High-throughput characterization techniques play a pivotal role in assessing the compositional, structural, and functional attributes of materials within these libraries, yielding multidimensional datasets. Concurrently, recent advancements in computational materials science have notably expedited the discovery process by enabling high-throughput calculations and simulations of potential materials systems. These collective endeavors foster a more robust correlation between composition, processing, structure, and properties, facilitating the forecast and design of future materials through data-driven materials discovery. This approach allows for efficient optimization of newly identified materials. Furthermore, materials informatics, an integral element of this process, plays a crucial role in managing and extracting valuable insights from the vast data generated during materials discovery.

The interaction of water with surfaces is crucially important in a wide range of natural and technological settings. In particular, at low temperatures, unveiling the atomistic structure of adsorbed water clusters would provide valuable data for understanding the ice nucleation process. Using high-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy, several studies have demonstrated the presence of water pentamers, hexamers, and heptamers (and of their combinations) on a variety of metallic surfaces, as well as the initial stages of 2D ice growth on an insulating surface. However, in all of these cases, the observed structures were completely flat, providing a relatively straightforward path to interpretation. Here, we present high-resolution AFM measurements of several water clusters on Au(111) and Cu(111), whose understanding presents significant challenges due to both their highly 3D configuration and their large size. For each of them, we use a combination of machine learning, atomistic modeling with neural network potentials, and statistical sampling to propose an underlying atomic structure, finally comparing its AFM simulated images to the experimental ones. These results provide insights into the early phases of ice formation, which is a ubiquitous phenomenon ranging from biology to astrophysics.

The single-layer dimetal oxides (MOenes) are recently predicted two-dimensional materials derived from the widely investigated MXenes. To develop high-performance hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electro-catalysts that beyond oxygen-terminated MXenes, we theoretically proposed the oxygen-terminated V2O MOenes (2D V2O3) and explored their potential applications as HER electro-catalysts. Through the first-principles calculations, both the 1T and 2H phases of 2D V2O3 are confirmed to be structurally stable and electrically conductive. The simulations on catalytic performance and reaction mechanism on HER indicate that 2D V2O3 is highly active at a low hydrogen coverage of 18.75 %, with negligible activation barrier following the Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism. When comparing with the Ti-based and V-based MXenes, the 2D V2O3 takes advantages in higher HER catalytic activity and stability of the surface termination. Moreover, the 2D V2O3 is expected to be experimentally obtained by exfoliation method.

One standout technology for hydrogen production is water electrolysis, which has become widely adopted and firmly established. In conventional water electrolyzers, hydrogen generation occurs at the cathode by means of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) through a pH-dependent mechanism. This review article systematically explores and synthesizes the diverse range of descriptors that govern the HER. Beginning with an overview of the fundamental principles underlying the reaction, conventional HER key descriptors are described, including Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption and the d-band center theory. Furthermore, recent advancements in the field are highlighted as novel descriptors for recently emerged topological catalysts, such as carbides and sulfides. With the goal of facilitating the development of efficient and economically viable electrocatalysts for HER and promoting a sustainable hydrogen economy, this review consolidates the existing knowledge landscape into a comprehensive resource for researchers and engineers.

Constructing in-plane heterojunctions with high interfacial density using two-dimensional materials represents a promising yet challenging avenue for enhancing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in water electrolysis. In this work, we report that three-dimensional porous MoS2–ReS2 in-plane heterojunctions, fabricated via chemical vapor deposition, exhibit robust electrocatalytic activity for the water splitting reaction. The optimized MoS2–ReS2 in-plane heterojunction achieves superior HER performance across a wide pH range, requiring an overpotential of only 200 mV to reach a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in alkaline seawater. Thus, it outperforms standalone MoS2 and ReS2. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibits remarkable stability, enduring up to 200 h in alkaline seawater. Experimental results coupled with density functional theory calculations confirm that electron redistribution at the MoS2–ReS2 heterointerface is likely driven by disparities in in-plane work functions between the two phases. This leads to charge accumulation at the interface, thereby enhancing the adsorptive activity of S atoms toward H* intermediates and facilitating the dissociation of water molecules at the interface. This discovery offers valuable insights into the electrocatalytic mechanisms at the interface and provides a roadmap for designing high-performance, earth-abundant HER electrocatalysts suitable for practical applications.

Abstract Hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has become a key factor affecting the cycling stability of aqueous Zn-ion batteries, while the corresponding fundamental issues involving HER are still unclear. Herein, the reaction mechanisms of HER on various crystalline surfaces have been investigated by first-principle calculations based on density functional theory. It is found that the Volmer step is the rate-limiting step of HER on the Zn (002) and (100) surfaces, while, the reaction rates of HER on the Zn (101), (102) and (103) surfaces are determined by the Tafel step. Moreover, the correlation between HER activity and the generalized coordination number ( $$\overline{CN }$$    CN  ¯   ) of Zn at the surfaces has been revealed. The relatively weaker HER activity on Zn (002) surface can be attributed to the higher $$\overline{CN }$$    CN  ¯   of surface Zn atom. The atomically uneven Zn (002) surface shows significantly higher HER activity than the flat Zn (002) surface as the $$\overline{CN }$$    CN  ¯   of the surface Zn atom is lowered. The $$\overline{CN }$$    CN  ¯   of surface Zn atom is proposed as a key descriptor of HER activity. Tuning the $$\overline{CN }$$    CN  ¯   of surface Zn atom would be a vital strategy to inhibit HER on the Zn anode surface based on the presented theoretical studies. Furthermore, this work provides a theoretical basis for the in-depth understanding of HER on the Zn surface.

Abstract Electrochemical synthesis is a promising way for sustainable urea production, yet the exact mechanism has not been fully revealed. Herein, we explore the mechanism of electrochemical coupling of nitrite and carbon dioxide on Cu surfaces towards urea synthesis on the basis of a constant-potential method combined with an implicit solvent model. The working electrode potential, which has normally overlooked, is found influential on both the reaction mechanism and activity. The further computational study on the reaction pathways reveals that *CO-NH and *NH-CO-NH as the key intermediates. In addition, through the analysis of turnover frequencies under various potentials, pressures, and temperatures within a microkinetic model, we demonstrate that the activity increases with temperature, and the Cu(100) shows the highest efficiency towards urea synthesis among all three Cu surfaces. The electric double-layer capacitance also plays a key role in urea synthesis. Based on these findings, we propose two essential strategies to promote the efficiency of urea synthesis on Cu electrodes: increasing Cu(100) surface ratio and elevating the reaction temperature.

A rarely discussed phenomenon in the realm of photocatalytic materials involves the presence of gradient distributed dopants and defects from the interior to the surface. This intriguing characteristic has been successfully achieved in the case of ZnS through the incorporation of atomic monovalent copper ions (Cu+) and concurrent sulfur vacancies (Vs), resulting in a photocatalyst denoted as G-CZS1–x. Through the cooperative action of these atomic Cu dopants and Vs, G-CZS1–x significantly extends its photoabsorption range to encompass the full spectrum (200–2100 nm), which improves the solar utilization ability. This alteration enhances the efficiency of charge separation and optimizes Δ(H*) (free energy of hydrogen adsorption) to approach 0 eV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It is noteworthy that both surface-exposed atomic Cu and Vs act as active sites for photocatalysis. G-CZS1–x exhibits a significant H2 evolution rate of 1.01 mmol h–1 in the absence of a cocatalyst. This performance exceeds the majority of previously reported photocatalysts, exhibiting approximately 25-fold as ZnS, and 5-fold as H-CZS1–x with homogeneous distribution of equal content Cu dopants and Vs. In contrast to G-CZS1–x, the H adsorption on Cu sites for H-CZS1–x (ΔG(H*) = −1.22 eV) is excessively strong to inhibit the H2 release, and the charge separation efficiency for H-CZS1–x is relatively sluggish, revealing the positive role of a gradient distribution model of dopants and defects on activity enhancement. This work highlights the synergy of atomic dopants and defects in advancing photoactivity, as well as the significant benefit of the controllable distribution model of dopants and defects for photocatalysis.

The high capacitive performance of MXenes in acidic electrolytes has made them potential electrode materials for supercapacitors. In this study, we conducted a structural analysis of MXene surface functionalizations by identifying the surface group distribution pattern and revealed the energy storage process of MXene surface chemistry by combining a complete Pourbaix stability diagram and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Pourbaix diagram indicated that pH controls the surface termination; an acidic pH generates favorable initial surfaces of MXenes with a specific distribution of functional groups (10 hydroxyls with respect to 18 total locations for the selected surface unit). Using this, we report the charging and uncharging process of MXenes with transitions of surface oxygenic groups (−OH and -O) via hydrogen ion adsorption and desorption on the MXene surface. Our results demonstrated that transitions of surface functionalizations contribute to comparable pseudocapacitance and electrostatic capacitance for MXenes. These findings provide insights into understanding the MXene energy storage mechanism by controlling surface functionalizations through the experimental reaction environment and synthesis conditions.

The effect of oxygen enrichment on the performance of a self-recuperative radiant tube burner (RTB) was evaluated. Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stock (RANS) Fluid Dynamic Simulations (CFD) are performed on a non-recirculating radian tube burner with fuel-oxidant mixing and primary combustion reactions occurring inside a combustion chamber rather than in the radiant tube. The radiant tube burner is intended for drying applications with an operating surface temperature of around 950 K. Oxygen concentrations in the oxidant ranging from pure air to pure oxygen are evaluated, and the effect of oxygen enrichment on the flame structure, heat transfer, and burner performance is analyzed. The recuperative part of the RTB was also included in the analysis. The effect of O2 content, flue gas temperature, and mass flow rate on the performance of the heat exchanger is evaluated, and a correlation to describe the oxidant preheat temperature is calibrated with the data from the simulations. Oxygen enrichment significantly impacts the performance of the self-recuperative radiant tube burner. The mean radiant tube temperature and the radiation efficiency rise with increasing oxygen enrichment until it reaches a peak value around 40% O2 for the burner evaluated; beyond this value, the efficiency of the RTB begins to decline. The same oxygen enrichment gives the higher energy recovery ratio in the heat exchanger at flow rates corresponding to constant reference thermal power. The position of the flame and the interplay between the variations in specific heat, emissivity, temperature, and flow rate of the gases explain these results.

Abstract High-performance platinum-group-metal-free alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction catalysts are essential for the hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cells, which generally require high Pt loadings on the anode. Herein, we report a highly active hydrogen oxidation reaction catalyst, NiCuCr, indicated by the hydroxide exchange membrane fuel cell with a high peak power density of 577 mW cm −2 (18 times as high as the Ni/C anode) and a stability of more than 150 h (a degradation rate slower by 7 times than the Ni/C anode). The spectroscopies demonstrate that the alloy effect from Cu weakens the hydrogen binding, and the surface Cr 2 O 3 species enhance the interfacial water binding. Both effects bring an optimized apparent hydrogen binding energy and thus lead to the high hydrogen oxidation reaction performance of NiCuCr. These results suggest that the apparent hydrogen binding energy determines the hydrogen oxidation reaction performance and that its tuning is beneficial toward high electrocatalytic performance.

Abstract Investigating spin dynamics in electrocatalysis is crucial for the rational design of magnetically heterogeneous catalysts. Utilizing spin‐polarized density functional theory calculation, herein, the spin dynamic of diatomic Co₂‐supported γ‐graphyne (Co 2 ‐GY) catalysts during the process of CO electroreduction (eCORR) is identified, focusing on the effect of the applied potential and acidity on spin dynamic and catalytic performance. In particular, the obtained Co 2 ‐GY shows a new efficient C 2 pathway of CH 2 * + CHO* coupling mechanism, resulting in the optimal CH 3 CH 2 OH product with ∆G of 0.50 eV and the selectivity of 99.99% under alkaline conditions. Under acidic media, Co 2 ‐GY exhibits the optimal C 1 product (CH 3 OH) with ∆G of 0.27 eV and a selectivity of 99.99%. During CO electroreduction, the reaction environment (pH and applied potential) influences spin dynamics in catalyst‐reactant systems, affecting the spin transition of diatomic Co 2 active sites among four magnetic states: ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, paramagnetic, and diamagnetic. These findings will be helpful for the rational design of transition‐metal heterogeneous catalysts.

Abstract Electrochemical acetonitrile hydrogenation compared with thermocatalytic hydrogenation provides a potential route to produce ethylamine in mild conditions. It is challenging to suppress the C–C coupling for improving ethylamine selectivity. Here, Ru‐supported Cu nanowire catalysts (Ru‐Cu NWs) are designed to achieve nearly 100% specific selectivity of ethylamine without coupling byproducts. In situ vibrational spectroscopy and electron spin resonance results reveal that the Ru‐Cu NWs provide a high active adsorption hydrogen (H*) coverage at the electrified interface so that the imine intermediates are more readily hydrogenated to generate ethylamine, thus suppressing the C–C coupling. Density functional theory calculations disclose that the formation of H* occurs more readily over Ru‐Cu NWs than Cu NWs. Moreover, the presence of Ru changes the potential‐determining step and facilitates the entire hydrogenation process. The strategy and understanding established here can be extended to other electrocatalytic hydrogenation reactions.

Abstract Shifting from the typical 4e – pathway to H 2 O in electrochemical oxygen reduction to the 2e – pathway to H 2 O 2 is increasingly recognized as an environmentally friendly approach for producing H 2 O 2 . However, the competitive 4e − pathway is a significant obstacle to the production of H 2 O 2 since H 2 O is the thermodynamically favored product. Here, a series of Pt, Pd, and Rh active atoms diluted within inert‐Au matrices with precisely controlled atomic arrangements and coordination environments are synthesized via facet engineering for O 2 ‐to‐H 2 O 2 production. Surprisingly, individually dispersed Pt atoms within the Au surface enclosed by the square atomic arrangements exhibit superior H 2 O 2 selectivity and achieve a maximum selectivity of 90% at 0.36 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Operando synchrotron ambient pressure X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy identifies the presence of *OOH key intermediates on these isolated Pt active sites. Grand canonical density‐functional theory also reveals that the kinetic energy barrier for the 2e − pathway (0.08 eV; OOH* + H + + e − → H 2 O 2 ) on the isolated Pt sites is significantly lower than the 4e − pathway (0.29 eV; OOH* + H + + e − → O* + H 2 O). This work enables atomic‐scale control in dilute binary alloy surfaces with specific configurations of isolated active atoms and provides essential guidance for catalyst design to boost O 2 ‐to‐H 2 O 2 production.

Exploring low-cost, high-activity, and structurally stable nonprecious metal electrocatalysts for sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is paramount for water electrolysis. Herein, we successfully prepare a novel Fe,Co-CeO2/CeF3@MXene heterostructure with Fe–Co dual active sites and oxygen vacancies for alkaline OER using an energy-free consumption co-deposition method. Impressively, Fe,Co-CeO2/CeF3@MXene achieves an ultralow overpotential of 192 mV and a long-term stability of 110 h at 10 mA cm−2 without structural changes, thereby outperforming the commercial IrO2 (345 mV). In addition, Fe,Co-CeO2/CeF3@MXene exhibits much superior activity (271 mV) and durability to IrO2 (385 mV) in the real seawater OER. Wind- and solar energy-assisted water electrolysis devices show their promising prospects for sustainable green hydrogen production. Characterization techniques and theoretical calculations reveal that the Fe,Co co-implanted CeO2/CeF3 heterostructure effectively degrades the energy barrier of the OER and optimizes the adsorption strength of *OH, *O, and *OOH intermediates. It exhibits the dual coupling mechanism of the adsorbed evolution and lattice oxygen mechanisms, which synergistically improves the OER performance. This work provides a facile and efficacious strategy for synthesizing a new class of heterostructures to achieve significant enhancement in the activity and stability of OER catalysts.

The technology of electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to produce hydrocarbon fuels not only alleviates energy shortages but also suppresses the greenhouse effect, demonstrating enormous potential applications. In this context, we aim to explore new reliable materials for reducing CO2 (CO2RR) through electrocatalysis. Hence, we investigated the performance of Cu3(C12X)2, where X signifies organic-ligands (N₁₂H₆, N₉H₃O₃, N₉H₃S₃, N₆O₆, N₆S₆) for the CO2RR using density functional theory (DFT). The 2D Cu3(C12X)2 monolayers show metallic characteristics because of the presence of adequate π electron conjugation network as-well-as a constructive interaction between the metal atom, organic-ligands, and benzene-rings, with the exception of Cu3(C12N9H3O3)2, which displayed semiconducting characteristic. The catalytic activity of Cu3(C12X)2 can be tuned by adjusting the organic-ligands' ability to facilitate interaction between the CO2RR intermediates and the metal complex (Cu-X4). Among all MOFs, Cu3(C12N6S6)2 have excellent CO2RR activity towards CO and formic acid. All other Cu3(C12X)2 monolayers demonstrated dynamic CO2RR catalytic activity as well as superior selectivity over hydrogen evolution (HER) suggesting that these materials have the potential to be useful as CO2RR electrocatalysts. This study introduces the concept of building MOFs with favorable features to meet the specific needs of a number of research domains including catalysis, energy conversion and storage.

Direct Z-schemes for photocatalytic overall water splitting for hydrogen generation are constructed for Sc2CCl2/MoTe2 and Sc2CCl2/Hf2CO2 heterostructures on the basis of the calculated band alignment and built-in electric field. Solar-to-hydrogen efficiency (ηSTH′), which is evaluated using the overpotentials of the band edges and band gaps, can reach 22.09 % for Sc2CCl2/MoTe2 and 19.07 % for Sc2CCl2/Hf2CO2. Tensile strains have little effect on ηSTH′. Compressive strains substantially increase the ηSTH′ of Sc2CCl2/MoTe2 and boost that of the Sc2CCl2/Hf2CO2 heterostructure only slightly. Nonadiabatic dynamics simulations reveal that the lifetime of the photogenerated electron in one of the stacking patterns of Sc2CCl2/MoTe2 is much larger than that of the other configurations, indicating that the reduction ability of the electron is well protected. However, the interlayer electron–hole recombination in Sc2CCl2/MoTe2 is faster than that in Sc2CCl2/Hf2CO2, implying that the Z-schemes with the former are more efficient than the Z-schemes with the latter. The hydrogen and oxidation evolution reactions with the two heterostructures are thermodynamically feasible but the reactions cannot proceed spontaneously. These findings provide a helpful guide for the development of photocatalytic materials for photocatalytic hydrogen generation from overall water splitting based on the title heterostructures.

Although alloying Pt with Ti is a feasible routine to improve oxygen reduction activity and stability, the atomic configuration of surface alloys on PtTi is still lacking deep understanding. Herein, the effect of Ti concentrations (x) in sublayer on ORR activity of PtTi surface alloys (Pt@Pt1-xTix@) with FCC or HCP Ti substrate, are systematically studied by first-principles calculations. The accurate atomic structural descriptor based on cluster expansion method is proposed to describe local atomic environment effect on intermediate (OH/OOH) adsorption ability. Different from b = 3.20 eV in traditional linear scaling relationship ΔGOOH = ΔGOH + b, the b values vary from 3.15 to 3.53 eV on PtTi surface alloys. Among surfaces alloys with different Ti concentrations, FCC- and HCP-Pt@Pt1-xTix(Pt)@ displayed the highest stability and catalytic activity at x = 3/9, and possessed a threefold and fivefold times of catalytic activity with a benchmark Pt(111) according to the calculated exchange current rate constants. Importantly, the FCC-Pt@Pt1-xTix(Pt)@ could be promising ORR catalyst as its high ORR activity at larger range of Ti concentration (x = 1/9–3/9), strong stability, and low Pt usage.

Manganese-cobalt layered double hydroxide (MnCo-LDH) is a kind of layered bimetallic hydroxide with good catalytic performance and stability for water decomposition. In this paper, a series of defective MnCo-LDH materials with different Mn/Co molar ratio was prepared by hydrothermal method. The results show that the MnCo-nanoflowers containing Mn and Co elements are successfully prepared, and all of them contain N, O, Mn and Co elements. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalytic performance of Co vacancy (VCo)-MnCo-LDH is better than that of commercial electrode Pt/C, and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance of Mn vacancy (VMn)-MnCo-LDH is better than that of commercial electrode RuO2. Two-electrode overall water splitting (OWS) test showed that the overpotential required by VMn-MnCo-LDH/NF||VCo-MnCo-LDH/NF and Pt/C/NF||RuO2/NF were 1.56 V and 1.72 V respectively at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, and the catalytic activity of the prepared defective MnCo-LDH is excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts for both HER and OER.

The performance of single atom catalyst (SAC) is strongly affected by its carrier. Five configurations with single vacancy, double vacancy, and defect site were calculated using density functional theory (DFT), and it was found that the electronic structure and state density were effectively regulated after introducing the B atom. The ORR activity was studied by doping different coordination layers. The results show that when doped with the second coordination layer of Co-DVG-N4 configuration, B can improve the adsorption strength of the central Co atom to the oxygen intermediate and show excellent ORR activity. Co-DVG-N4-B4(12.9 %) and Co-DVG-N4-B5(16.1 %) have relatively low overpotentials of 0.49 V and 0.47 V, providing an effective theoretical basis for rationalizing efficient electrocatalysts based on Co carbon materials.
