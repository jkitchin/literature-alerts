Epitaxial InAs-based nanowire (NW) arrays have recently gained attention as promising materials for infrared optoelectronics. To shift the spectral sensitivity of NW-based photodetectors, we for the first time investigated dilute nitride InAsN nanowires on Si(111). The growth of InAsN nanowires with a wurtzite phase was achieved through a self-induced mechanism using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Two growth strategies were employed to synthesize InAsN and InAs/InAsN core–shell nanowires, allowing for independent control over the morphology and optical properties. According to the photoluminescence measurement and performed ab initio calculations for the wurtzite InAsN structure, we estimate the atomic concentration of the incorporated nitrogen in the studied structure as 0.5–0.7%. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction reveal a wurtzite crystal lattice volume shrinkage with an increase in nitrogen content. Our results demonstrate the potential of dilute nitride InAsN for strain and band gap engineering in NW photodetectors on Si.

The current small-scale synthesis and relatively large size of Cu2O have limited its practical applications. Herein, we developed a hydrolysis strategy to prepare phase-pure Cu2O networks composed of small granules (ca. 25 nm) on a gram scale. The preparation involves in situ hydrolyzing the Hx[CuxCl2x] complexes prereduced in N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF). The DMF-soluble Hx[CuxCl2x] complexes are critical for the homogeneous nucleation of CuCl seeds and subsequent hydrolysis, allowing for separate control over the nucleation and growth stages to regulate the formation of Cu2O networks. The novel Cu2O networks possess numerous exposed active sites and hierarchical porosities, conferring high catalytic activity and fast mass transfer capability. The inherent peroxidase-mimic activity of Cu2O is severely inhibited under neutral conditions but can be triggered by Cr6+, enabling the colorimetric assay of Cr6+ with the assistance of the oxidation-induced color change of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. Through density functional theory calculation, we confirmed that the attachment of Cr6+ on the Cu2O surface reduced the dissociation energy of H2O2, enhancing the enzyme-mimic activity. The colorimetric detection method demonstrated a sensitive and specific assay capability for Cr6+ (LOD = 0.095 μM). Our work offers a straightforward protocol for novel design of metal or metal-based nanomaterials for nanozymes or other applications.

Abstract Heteroatom doping can tune the band structure of semiconductors and enhance their carrier transfer capacity for improving the performance of photoelectrochemical water oxidation. Nevertheless, the introduction of dopants is not always beneficial. In this study, magnesium (Mg) is adopted to dope ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheet array photoanodes to form a type‐II band structure and reduce bulk recombination, but concurrently introduced deleterious oxygen (O) defects slow down the surface catalytic reaction kinetics. Furthermore, a facile heat treatment strategy is proposed to transform these O defects into Mg─O bonds. First‐principles calculations and electrochemical characterization indicate that the presence of Mg─O bonds provides abundant active sites and efficiently accelerates the surface oxygen evolution reaction by precisely realigning the rate‐determining step from OH* to O* (step 2) to OOH* to O 2 (step 4), thereby retarding charge trapping and recombination. As a result, such a photoanode achieves a remarkable performance with a photocurrent as high as 4.91 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, and the onset potential shifts negatively about 340 mV. This work provides a new defect modulation idea for converting detrimental defects to favorable ones, and it can be expected to have wide applications in the fields of energy, catalysis, and optoelectronics, etc.

Abstract Stacking of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as a facile strategy for realising exotic quantum states of matter and engineering electronic properties. Yet, developments beyond the proof-of-principle level are impeded by the vast size of the configuration space defined by layer combinations and stacking orders. Here we employ a density functional theory (DFT) workflow to calculate interlayer binding energies of 8451 homobilayers created by stacking 1052 different monolayers in various configurations. Analysis of the stacking orders in 247 experimentally known van der Waals crystals is used to validate the workflow and determine the criteria for realisable bilayers. For the 2586 most stable bilayer systems, we calculate a range of electronic, magnetic, and vibrational properties, and explore general trends and anomalies. We identify an abundance of bistable bilayers with stacking order-dependent magnetic or electrical polarisation states making them candidates for slidetronics applications.

In this work, we unravel the role of the system components in the charge transfer processes occurring in the 2-electron reduction of CO2. We focus our analysis on the pincer-complex/graphene composite system in order to explain the role of the donors of the pincer ligands in the elementary charge transfer processes. To achieve this goal, we have used the unique combination of the constrained DFT method and computational hydrogen electrode. The results obtained this way allowed us to conclude that the catalytic performance of the system depends to a great extent on the electron-donating properties of the Ru-pincer complex. We have determined, that the optimal charge transfer in the system is due to the easy, single-step transfer to the activated CO2 molecule and the energies required for such transfer are comparable to the limiting potential of the reaction.

Carbon-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely investigated as a potential alternative for noble-metal-based catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The rational design of such catalysts requires not only physical intuitions but also practical descriptors that can be directly applied in experiments. In this work, we establish a practical theoretical framework based on a comprehensive data set of SACs compromising 28 metals, 5 types of local environments, and adsorption calculations for 4 adsorbates (e.g., H/O/OH/OOH). We disentangle the complex trend of H/OH adsorption as an interplay between d-orbital periodicity and local hybridization, allowing for the estimation of the catalytic performance solely on the basis of the number of valence electrons. By utilizing this data set and theoretical framework, we have also identified several promising catalyst candidates and overlooked design strategies.

Catalyzing oxygen reduction toward water, while generating electrical energy, holds great potential in scaling eco-friendly energy conversation and storage technologies. Current studies have largely focused on single iron atomic catalysts and carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles. Consequently, the exploration of alternative catalysts has been restricted, leaving a wealth of potential undiscovered. Here, we reported a transition from metallic to covalent bonding in carbon-supported transition metal catalysts (TM@Cs), which can explain the formation of two high-activity regions that are centered around iron single atomic catalysts and Pt-NPs. In addition to the classical scaling relation (ΔG*OOH = ΔG*OH + 3.2), we identified a novel scaling relation (ΔG*OOH = 1.55ΔG*OH + 0.77) between *OOH and *OH adsorption energy, dictating the presence of the second oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. TM@Cs with a higher metal-to-covalent bond ratio demonstrate a strong adsorption, favoring this new ORR pathway and suggesting inferior activity compared to that along the traditional ORR pathway. By increasing the covalent bonds in TM@Cs, it is likely to diminish the adsorption strength, thereby transitioning from this new pathway back to the conventional pathway and showing an activity improvement. This work provides a deep understanding of carbon-supported metal catalysts in designing effective catalysts.

Eco-friendly photocatalysts for water splitting, highly efficient in oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions, hold great promise for the storage of inexhaustible solar energy and address environmental challenges. However, current common photocatalysts rarely exhibit both H2 and O2 production performances unless some regulatory measures, such as strain engineering, are implemented. Additionally, the extensive utilization of flexible electronics remains constrained by their high Young’s modulus. Herein, on the basis of density functional theory calculations, we identify a novel spontaneous oxygen-producing two-dimensional Ca(BiO2)2 material, which can efficiently regulate the electronic structures of the surface active sites, optimize the reaction pathways, reduce the reaction energy barriers, and boost the overall water-splitting activity through biaxial strain modulation. In detail, an unstrained Ca(BiO2)2 monolayer not only possesses a suitable band gap value (2.02 eV) to fulfill the photocatalytic water-splitting band edge relationships but also holds favorable transport properties, excellent optical absorption across the visible light spectrum, and spontaneous oxygen production under neutral conditions. More excitingly, under application of a 7% biaxial tensile strain modulation with an ideal biaxial strength of 32.35 GPa nm, the Ca(BiO2)2 monolayer not only maintains its structural integrity but also exhibits a completely spontaneous reaction for photocatalytic hydrogen precipitation with superior optical absorption. This can primarily be attributed to the substantial reduction of the potential barrier through strain engineering as well as the weakening of bond energy resulting from changes of the adsorption site as calculated by crystal orbital Hamiltonian population analysis. This flexible stretchable electronic modulated the photocatalyst behavior and bond energy of O–Bi and O–Ca interactions, offering outstanding potential for photocatalytic water spontaneous oxygen and hydrogen evolution among all of the reported metal oxides, and is more likely to become a promising candidate for future flexible electronic devices.

Abstract The modulation of the coordination environment of single atom catalysts (SACs) plays a vital role in promoting CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). Herein, N or B doped Fe‐embedded graphyne (Fe‐GY), Fe‐nXGYm ( n = 1, 2, 3; X = N, B; m = 1, 2, 3), are employed as probes to reveal the effect of the coordination environment engineering on CO 2 RR performance via heteroatom doping in SACs. The results show that the doping position and number of N or B in Fe‐GY significantly affects catalyst activity and CO 2 RR product selectivity. In comparison, Fe‐1NGY exhibits high‐performance CO 2 RR to CH 4 with a low limiting potential of −0.17 V, and Fe‐2NGY3 is demonstrated as an excellent CO 2 RR electrocatalyst for producing HCOOH with a low limiting potential of −0.16 V. With applied potential, Fe‐GY, Fe‐1NGY, and Fe‐2NGY3 exhibit significant advantages in CO 2 RR to CH 4 while hydrogen evolution reaction is inhibited. The intrinsic essence analysis illustrates that heteroatom doping modulates the electronic structure of active sites and regulates the adsorption strength of the intermediates, thereby rendering a favorable coordination environment for CO 2 RR. This work highlights Fe‐nXGYm as outstanding SACs for CO 2 RR, and provides an in‐depth insight into the intrinsic essence of the promotion effect from heteroatom doping.

Abstract Developing a CO 2 -utilization and energy-storage integrated system possesses great advantages for carbon- and energy-intensive industries. Efforts have been made to developing the Zn-CO 2 batteries, but access to long cycling life and low charging voltage remains a grand challenge. Here we unambiguously show such inefficiencies originate from the high-barrier oxygen evolution reaction on charge, and by recharging the battery via oxidation of reducing molecules, Faradaic efficiency-enhanced CO 2 reduction and low-overpotential battery regeneration can be simultaneously achieved. Showcased by using hydrazine oxidation, our battery demonstrates a long life over 1000 hours with a charging voltage as low as 1.2 V. The low charging voltage and formation of gaseous product upon hydrazine oxidation are the key to stabilize the catalyst over cycling. Our findings suggest that by fundamentally taming the asymmetric reactions, aqueous batteries are viable tools to achieve integrated energy storage and CO 2 conversion that is economical, highly energy efficient, and scalable.

The 3D NiMoxCo2–xO4 (x ≤ 0.06) chestnut-like spinel oxide nanoparticles (CNSPs) grown on Ni foam were effectively prepared hydrothermally. The formation of Ni–Co CNSPs was confirmed by the XRD powder pattern, which exhibited a pure cubic spinel oxide structure without undesired phases. All ratios revealed a broadened peak representing a small crystal size (12.8–17.5 nm) range. The chestnut-like CNSPs were presented by FE-SEM, SEM, TEM, and HR-TEM analysis. The chemical composition of the products was confirmed by EDX. The 3D NiMoxCo2–xO4 (x = 0.04) CNSP electrocatalyst exhibited hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity as evidenced by 0.224 V overpotential, Tafel slope 61.9 mV/dec, and high stability for 36 h of chronopotentiometry techniques. The surface and electrochemical characterization revealed that 4.0% Mo-doped exhibits improved HER activity due to significantly higher electrochemical surface area and accelerated charge-transfer kinetics at the semiconductor electrolyte interface. Density functional theory is employed to investigate the impact of Mo dopants on the HER performance. This study shows how both hydrogen and water molecules adhere to the surface of Mo-doped NiCo2O4 slab structures. The findings indicate that introducing Mo dopants leads to an augmentation of chemical activity through water adsorption, resulting in an enhanced electrocatalytic process and improved HER activity up to a specific Mo concentration, and their impact on spin-dependent electronic structure characteristics is revealed by the density of states spectra. This work not only gives insights into low-metal-cost materials for efficient and durable HER electrocatalysts, but it also provides a successful showcase model catalyst for in-depth mechanistic insights into electrochemical HER processes and their industrial applications in the future.

Methodologies for training machine learning potentials (MLPs) with quantum-mechanical simulation data have recently seen tremendous progress. Experimental data have a very different character than simulated data, and most MLP training procedures cannot be easily adapted to incorporate both types of data into the training process. We investigate a training procedure based on iterative Boltzmann inversion that produces a pair potential correction to an existing MLP using equilibrium radial distribution function data. By applying these corrections to an MLP for pure aluminum based on density functional theory, we observe that the resulting model largely addresses previous overstructuring in the melt phase. Interestingly, the corrected MLP also exhibits improved performance in predicting experimental diffusion constants, which are not included in the training procedure. The presented method does not require autodifferentiating through a molecular dynamics solver and does not make assumptions about the MLP architecture. Our results suggest a practical framework for incorporating experimental data into machine learning models to improve the accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations.

The rapid and efficient conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) is an ongoing challenge. Catalysts based on iron-porphyrin cores have emerged as excellent electrochemical mediators of the two proton + two electron reduction of CO2 to CO, and many of the design features that promote function are known. Of those design features, the incorporation of Brønsted acids in the second coordination sphere of the iron ion has a significant impact on catalyst turnover kinetics. The Brønsted acids are often in the form of hydroxyphenyl groups. Herein, we explore how the acidity of an ancillary 2-hydroxyphenyl group affects the performance of CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. A series of meso-5,10,15,20-tetraaryl porphyrins were prepared where only the functional group at the 5-meso position has an ionizable proton. A series of cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments reveal that the complex with −OMe positioned para to the ionizable −OH shows the largest CO2 reduction rate constants in acetonitrile solvent. This is the least acidic −OH of the compounds surveyed. The turnover frequency of the −OMe derivative can be further improved with the addition of 4-trifluoromethylphenol to the solution. In contrast, the iron-porphyrin complex with −CF3 positioned opposite the ionizable −OH shows the smallest CO2 reduction rate constants, and its turnover frequency is less enhanced with the addition of phenols to the reaction solutions. The origin of this effect is rationalized based on kinetic isotope effect experiments and density functional calculations. We conclude that catalysts with weaker internal acids coupled with stronger external acid additives provide superior CO2 reduction kinetics.

In this work, we have employed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) to account for the comparative efficiency of TiO2 and g-CN supported Ru2 and Rh2 dual-atom catalysts (DACs) for electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RRs). Based on DFT calculations, g-CN supported DACs were found to have superior stability and CO2 reduction activity than that of TiO2 supported DACs. However, Ru2@g-CN and Rh2@g-CN double atom catalysts suffer from poor selectivity, as the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is likely to occur more favorably than that of CO2RR. Here, we have revealed that the replacement of one noble metal by an earth-abundant transition metal can boost the selectivity of CO2RRs, while inhibiting the HER. In search of a highly selective and low-cost noble-metal based CO2 reduction catalyst, we have designed a series of g-CN supported heteronuclear MRu (M = Sc–Zn) dimers and performed a systematic computational screening to identify a suitable adatom (M), which drastically improves the selectivity. Based on the evaluation of stability, activity, and selectivity, VRu@g-CN is finally identified as the best candidate, with the lowest limiting potential of −0.11 V and a high theoretical Faradaic efficiency of 99.57%.

Abstract Nanostructured ionic compounds have driven major technological advancements in displays, photovoltaics, and catalysis. Current research focuses on refining the chemical composition of such compounds. In this study, a strategy for creating stoichiometrically well‐defined nanoscale multiple‐cation systems, where the atomically precise structure maximizes the synergistic cooperation between cations at the atomic scale is reported. The unprecedented construction of Heusler‐type PtRuP 2 double‐walled nanotubes through sequential anion/cation exchange reactions is demonstrated. The PtRuP 2 catalyst exhibits record‐high catalytic performance and durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolytes and anion‐exchange membrane water electrolyzers. The investigations highlight the crucial role of Pt/Ru dual centers, providing multiple active sites that accelerate the HER kinetics within a single phosphide material, in the sequential operation of H 2 O activation/dissociation at Ru and H 2 production at adjacent Pt sites. These findings open new avenues for optimizing ionic compound‐based HER electrocatalysts, offering platinum‐metal alternatives in acidic and alkaline media.

Electro-oxidation is a way to utilize glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel production, to produce fuels and feedstock chemicals for the chemical industry. A significant challenge is to get products with high selectivity, so it is desirable to understand the glycerol oxidation mechanisms in further detail. Using density functional theory calculations, we investigated possible glycerol oxidation intermediates on Pt(111) and Ag(111). We find that the different adsorption preferences of the intermediates on Pt (adsorption via carbon atoms) and Ag (adsorption via oxygen atoms) lead to different preferred reaction pathways, resulting in different products. The reaction pathways on both surfaces involve glyceraldehyde as a key intermediate; however, upon further oxidation, Pt(111) preferentially produces glyceric acid (CH2OH–CHOH–COOH), while on Ag(111) C–C bonds are broken, which leads to the production of glycolaldehyde and formic acid (CH2OH–CHO and HCOOH). These predictions agree well with the experimental outcome of the electro-oxidation of glycerol on Pt and Ag surfaces. Our study therefore provides useful insights for optimizing the selectivity of glycerol oxidation and improving the utilization of glycerol.

We present the first comprehensive investigation of transition metal-substituted Hydroxyapatite (TM-HAP) materials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Density functional theory (DFT) was used to study in a systematic manner the stability of 3d, 4d, 5d transition metal dopants on the HAP (000̅1) surface, analyzing their stability, activity, and selectivity for photocatalytic CO2RR. DFT results allowed to narrow down the selection to three transition metal elements (Co, Ni, Mo) based on their structural stability, band structure and performance. A selective analysis of product formation for carbon monoxide and formate was made, showing that TM dopants facilitate the initial protonation step in the CO2 reduction by adsorbing H2 molecule on TM atoms and then dissociating it into two hydrogen atoms. The performance of Ni- and Co-HAP towards the reaction activity is consistent with experimental results. Mo-HAP stands as a new and attractive photocatalyst for further investigation, given its excellent predicted performance.

Electrochemical membrane technology has been identified as a promising technology for sustainable chemical and energy production due to its potential to address several challenges in the production of chemicals and energy, including energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste generation. Electrochemical membrane processes can be applied to produce a wide range of feedstocks, including gases, liquids, and solids. This versatility can enable the coproduction of multiple chemicals and energy products from various feedstocks. In this chapter, the production of chemicals and energy, including bioelectricity, biomethane, biohydrogen, bioethanol, hydrogen peroxide, biodegradable electronics and biosensors, dry air from humid air, air separation into nitrogen and oxygen gases, organic solvent extraction, CO2 and H2 separation from gas mixtures, plasma generation, dewatered microalgae biomass, and purified microalgae-based products, are discussed. Electrochemical membrane processes can offer environmental benefits, such as CO2 reduction, leading to more sustainable and socially responsible production practices. The electrochemical conversion of CO2 can lead to the production of valuable chemicals, such as ethanol. With continued research and development, electrochemical membrane technology is expected to play an increasingly important role in chemical and energy production.
