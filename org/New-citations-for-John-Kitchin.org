Intercalation (ic) of metal atoms into the van der Waals (vdW) gap of layered materials constitutes a facile strategy to create materials whose properties can be tuned via the concentration of the intercalated atoms. Here we perform systematic density functional theory calculations to explore various properties of an emergent class of crystalline 2D materials (ic-2D materials) comprising vdW homobilayers with native metal atoms on a sublattice of intercalation sites. From an initial set of 1348 ic-2D materials, generated from 77 vdW homobilayers, we find 95 structures with good thermodynamic stability (formation energy within 200 meV/atom of the convex hull). A significant fraction of the semiconducting host materials are found to undergo an insulator to metal transition upon self-intercalation, with only PdS2, PdSe2, and GeS2 maintaining a finite electronic gap. In five cases, self-intercalation introduces magnetism. In general, self-intercalation is found to promote metallicity and enhance the chemical reactivity on the basal plane. Based on the calculated H binding energy, we find that self-intercalated SnS2 and Hf3Te2 are promising candidates for hydrogen evolution catalysis. All the stable ic-2D structures and their calculated properties can be explored in the open C2DB database.

Bimetallic nanoclusters have attracted great interest due to their ability to enhance the catalytic properties of nanoclusters through synergetic effects that emerge from the combination of the metal nanocluster with different transition metal (TM) species. However, their indefinite composition and broad distribution hinder the insightful understanding of the interaction between these invasive metals in bimetallic doped nanoalloys. In this study, we report a density functional theory calculation with the PBEsol exchange-correlation functional for 16-atom TiN−1TM (TM = Ni, Ir, Pd) nanoalloys, which provides new insights into the synergetic effect of these invasive metals. The probe into the effect of these metal impurities revealed that the replacement of a Ti atom with Ni, Ir and Pd enhances the relative stability of the nanoalloys, and the maximum stability for a lower bimetallic composition is reached for Ti4Ir, Ti5Pd and Ti7Ni. The most stable nanoalloy is reached for the Ti12Ir cluster in comparison with the Ti12Pd and Ti12Ni clusters and pure Ti13 monoatomic nanocluster. This stability trend is as revealed well by both the binding energy and the dissociation energy. The average HOMO-LUMO gap for the bigger clusters revealed that the valence electrons in the HOMO can absorb lower energy, which is indicatory of a higher reactivity and lower stability. The quantum confinement is higher for the smaller clusters, which illustrates a higher stability and lower reactivity for those systems.

Replacing platinum-group metals by Ni-based catalysts for the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is highly desired for anion-exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), while huge challenges still exist due to the sluggish kinetics and oxidative deactivation of the Ni active centers. Herein, we report an ingenious design of the microstructured Ni-based electrocatalysts featured by nanoparticulate NiMo alloy cores encapsulated by N-doped carbon layer shells (NiMo-5%@NC) to address these problems. Electrochemical experiments and theoretical calculations confirm that the confinement effect can rationally weaken the binding energy to oxygenated species through direct interactions with the carbon layers rather than relying on the traditionally regulated electronic structures of NiMo surfaces. This ultimately reduces the energy barrier for water formation, the potential-determining step for the alkaline HOR undergoing the bifunctional path. Moreover, the incorporation of carbon layers not only enhances the passivation resistance of Ni-based surfaces but also alleviates the oxidative dissolution of the alloyed Mo-species, resulting in obviously improved stability. As a result, NiMo-5%@NC exhibits significantly improved HOR activity and stability compared to the counterpart without the protection of the shells (NiMo-5%). This work shows comprehensive insights into the confinement effect exerted by carbon layer shells, providing a different light on the guidelines to deal with the sluggish kinetics and oxidative deactivation of the Ni active centers for AEMFCs.

A detailed multiscale study of the mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation on a well-defined Ni/CeO2 model catalyst is reported that couples periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations with kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. The study includes an analysis of the role of Eley–Rideal elementary steps for the water formation step, which are usually neglected on the overall picture of the mechanism, catalytic activity, and selectivity. The DFT calculations for the chosen model consisting of a Ni4 cluster supported on CeO2 (111) show large enough adsorption energies along with low energy barriers that suggest this catalyst to be a good option for high selective CO2 methanation. The kMC simulations results show a synergic effect between the two 3-fold hollow sites of the supported Ni4 cluster with some elementary reactions dominant in one site, while other reactions prefer the another, nearly equivalent site. This effect is even more evident for the simulations explicitly including Eley–Rideal steps. The kMC simulations reveal that CO is formed via the dissociative pathway of the reverse water–gas shift reaction, while methane is formed via a CO2 → CO → HCO → CH → CH2 → CH3 → CH4 mechanism. Overall, our results show the importance of including the Eley–Rideal reactions and point to small Ni clusters supported on the CeO2 (111) surface as potential good catalysts for high selective CO2 methanation under mild conditions, while very active and selective toward CO formation at higher temperatures.

Polycrystalline materials are ubiquitous in technology, and grain boundaries have long been known to affect materials properties and performance. First principles materials modeling and electron microscopy methods are powerful and highly complementary for investigating the atomic scale structure and properties of grain boundaries. In this review, we provide an introduction to key concepts and approaches for investigating grain boundaries using these methods. We also provide a number of case studies providing examples of their application to understand the impact of grain boundaries for a range of energy materials. Most of the materials presented are of interest for photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical applications and so we include a more in depth discussion of how modeling and electron microscopy can be employed to understand the impact of grain boundaries on the behavior of photoexcited electrons and holes (including carrier transport and recombination). However, we also include discussion of materials relevant to rechargeable batteries as another important class of materials for energy applications. We conclude the review with a discussion of outstanding challenges in the field and the exciting prospects for progress in the coming years.

Herein, the covalent triazine framework (CTF) named Tz-TA was synthesized by Schiff base reaction between 4,4′-(thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-2,5-diyl)dibenzaldehyde (TzDA) and terephthalimidamide (TA). The polymer based heterojunctions (PHJs) Tz-TA/g-C3N4-x (x refers to mass percentage of Tz-TA) were constructed by combining g-C3N4 and Tz-TA through physical ball milling. Tz-TA/g-C3N4-x catalysts all showed considerably enhanced hydrogen evolution rates (HER) than each of the separate photocatalyst, and among which, Tz-TA/g-C3N4-50 exhibited the highest HER of 5426.28 μmol g-1h−1 with a 3 wt% Pt as the co-catalyst under visible light irradiation, which is 4.7 and 2.5 times of g-C3N4 and Tz-TA, respectively. The optoelectronic measurements revealed that the formation of the PHJs enhanced the separation and transport efficiency of photo-generated excitons, and delayed the recombination rates of the electron-hole couples. Coupling with the results from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and free radical analyses, a type II configuration of the PHJs was confirmed, which is accountable for their enhanced photocatalytic hydrogen production (PHP) performance.

Utilizing electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to synthesize chemical fuels is an effective strategy to alleviate environmental pollution and energy crisis. In this work, a series of single transition metal atoms (TM = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd) are doped into boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) of BN divacancy defect with different curvature parameters, which are named as TM-DVBNNT(n, n), and their CO2RR catalytic performance is systematically studied by density functional theory (DFT) methods. To begin with, the calculation results of formation energy and dissolution potential show that all TM-DVBNNT(n, n) have good thermodynamic and electrochemical stability. Secondly, after calculation of Gibbs free energy, Mn-, Fe-, Ru, and Rh-DVBNNT(5, 5) have good catalytic performance with the corresponding limiting potential (UL) values of − 0.43, −0.40, −0.27, and − 0.50 V, respectively. Based on this, we further investigate the influence of curvature on the stability, activity, and mechanism of Ru-DVBNNT(n, n) with the highest activity. It is worth noting that as the diameter of Ru-DVBNNT(n, n) continues to increase, their stability and activity also continue to enhance, and Ru-DVBNNT(8, 8) with the largest diameter is expected to become the best performing CO2RR electrocatalyst with the UL value of − 0.16 V. Besides, for Ru-DVBNNT(3, 3) and Ru-DVBNNT(4, 4), their final product is HCOOH. In contrast, the CH4 product is more inclined to form on Ru-DVBNNTs with chiral indexes of (5, 5), (6, 6), (7, 7), and (8, 8). In summary, this work has laid a solid theoretical foundation for future experimental design of nanotube structures.

Epitaxial InAs-based nanowire (NW) arrays have recently gained attention as promising materials for infrared optoelectronics. To shift the spectral sensitivity of NW-based photodetectors, we for the first time investigated dilute nitride InAsN nanowires on Si(111). The growth of InAsN nanowires with a wurtzite phase was achieved through a self-induced mechanism using plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. Two growth strategies were employed to synthesize InAsN and InAs/InAsN core–shell nanowires, allowing for independent control over the morphology and optical properties. According to the photoluminescence measurement and performed ab initio calculations for the wurtzite InAsN structure, we estimate the atomic concentration of the incorporated nitrogen in the studied structure as 0.5–0.7%. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction reveal a wurtzite crystal lattice volume shrinkage with an increase in nitrogen content. Our results demonstrate the potential of dilute nitride InAsN for strain and band gap engineering in NW photodetectors on Si.

The current small-scale synthesis and relatively large size of Cu2O have limited its practical applications. Herein, we developed a hydrolysis strategy to prepare phase-pure Cu2O networks composed of small granules (ca. 25 nm) on a gram scale. The preparation involves in situ hydrolyzing the Hx[CuxCl2x] complexes prereduced in N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF). The DMF-soluble Hx[CuxCl2x] complexes are critical for the homogeneous nucleation of CuCl seeds and subsequent hydrolysis, allowing for separate control over the nucleation and growth stages to regulate the formation of Cu2O networks. The novel Cu2O networks possess numerous exposed active sites and hierarchical porosities, conferring high catalytic activity and fast mass transfer capability. The inherent peroxidase-mimic activity of Cu2O is severely inhibited under neutral conditions but can be triggered by Cr6+, enabling the colorimetric assay of Cr6+ with the assistance of the oxidation-induced color change of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. Through density functional theory calculation, we confirmed that the attachment of Cr6+ on the Cu2O surface reduced the dissociation energy of H2O2, enhancing the enzyme-mimic activity. The colorimetric detection method demonstrated a sensitive and specific assay capability for Cr6+ (LOD = 0.095 μM). Our work offers a straightforward protocol for novel design of metal or metal-based nanomaterials for nanozymes or other applications.

Abstract Heteroatom doping can tune the band structure of semiconductors and enhance their carrier transfer capacity for improving the performance of photoelectrochemical water oxidation. Nevertheless, the introduction of dopants is not always beneficial. In this study, magnesium (Mg) is adopted to dope ZnIn 2 S 4 nanosheet array photoanodes to form a type‐II band structure and reduce bulk recombination, but concurrently introduced deleterious oxygen (O) defects slow down the surface catalytic reaction kinetics. Furthermore, a facile heat treatment strategy is proposed to transform these O defects into Mg─O bonds. First‐principles calculations and electrochemical characterization indicate that the presence of Mg─O bonds provides abundant active sites and efficiently accelerates the surface oxygen evolution reaction by precisely realigning the rate‐determining step from OH* to O* (step 2) to OOH* to O 2 (step 4), thereby retarding charge trapping and recombination. As a result, such a photoanode achieves a remarkable performance with a photocurrent as high as 4.91 mA cm −2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, and the onset potential shifts negatively about 340 mV. This work provides a new defect modulation idea for converting detrimental defects to favorable ones, and it can be expected to have wide applications in the fields of energy, catalysis, and optoelectronics, etc.

Abstract Stacking of two-dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as a facile strategy for realising exotic quantum states of matter and engineering electronic properties. Yet, developments beyond the proof-of-principle level are impeded by the vast size of the configuration space defined by layer combinations and stacking orders. Here we employ a density functional theory (DFT) workflow to calculate interlayer binding energies of 8451 homobilayers created by stacking 1052 different monolayers in various configurations. Analysis of the stacking orders in 247 experimentally known van der Waals crystals is used to validate the workflow and determine the criteria for realisable bilayers. For the 2586 most stable bilayer systems, we calculate a range of electronic, magnetic, and vibrational properties, and explore general trends and anomalies. We identify an abundance of bistable bilayers with stacking order-dependent magnetic or electrical polarisation states making them candidates for slidetronics applications.

In this work, we unravel the role of the system components in the charge transfer processes occurring in the 2-electron reduction of CO2. We focus our analysis on the pincer-complex/graphene composite system in order to explain the role of the donors of the pincer ligands in the elementary charge transfer processes. To achieve this goal, we have used the unique combination of the constrained DFT method and computational hydrogen electrode. The results obtained this way allowed us to conclude that the catalytic performance of the system depends to a great extent on the electron-donating properties of the Ru-pincer complex. We have determined, that the optimal charge transfer in the system is due to the easy, single-step transfer to the activated CO2 molecule and the energies required for such transfer are comparable to the limiting potential of the reaction.

Carbon-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely investigated as a potential alternative for noble-metal-based catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The rational design of such catalysts requires not only physical intuitions but also practical descriptors that can be directly applied in experiments. In this work, we establish a practical theoretical framework based on a comprehensive data set of SACs compromising 28 metals, 5 types of local environments, and adsorption calculations for 4 adsorbates (e.g., H/O/OH/OOH). We disentangle the complex trend of H/OH adsorption as an interplay between d-orbital periodicity and local hybridization, allowing for the estimation of the catalytic performance solely on the basis of the number of valence electrons. By utilizing this data set and theoretical framework, we have also identified several promising catalyst candidates and overlooked design strategies.

Catalyzing oxygen reduction toward water, while generating electrical energy, holds great potential in scaling eco-friendly energy conversation and storage technologies. Current studies have largely focused on single iron atomic catalysts and carbon-supported platinum nanoparticles. Consequently, the exploration of alternative catalysts has been restricted, leaving a wealth of potential undiscovered. Here, we reported a transition from metallic to covalent bonding in carbon-supported transition metal catalysts (TM@Cs), which can explain the formation of two high-activity regions that are centered around iron single atomic catalysts and Pt-NPs. In addition to the classical scaling relation (ΔG*OOH = ΔG*OH + 3.2), we identified a novel scaling relation (ΔG*OOH = 1.55ΔG*OH + 0.77) between *OOH and *OH adsorption energy, dictating the presence of the second oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) pathway. TM@Cs with a higher metal-to-covalent bond ratio demonstrate a strong adsorption, favoring this new ORR pathway and suggesting inferior activity compared to that along the traditional ORR pathway. By increasing the covalent bonds in TM@Cs, it is likely to diminish the adsorption strength, thereby transitioning from this new pathway back to the conventional pathway and showing an activity improvement. This work provides a deep understanding of carbon-supported metal catalysts in designing effective catalysts.

Eco-friendly photocatalysts for water splitting, highly efficient in oxygen/hydrogen evolution reactions, hold great promise for the storage of inexhaustible solar energy and address environmental challenges. However, current common photocatalysts rarely exhibit both H2 and O2 production performances unless some regulatory measures, such as strain engineering, are implemented. Additionally, the extensive utilization of flexible electronics remains constrained by their high Young’s modulus. Herein, on the basis of density functional theory calculations, we identify a novel spontaneous oxygen-producing two-dimensional Ca(BiO2)2 material, which can efficiently regulate the electronic structures of the surface active sites, optimize the reaction pathways, reduce the reaction energy barriers, and boost the overall water-splitting activity through biaxial strain modulation. In detail, an unstrained Ca(BiO2)2 monolayer not only possesses a suitable band gap value (2.02 eV) to fulfill the photocatalytic water-splitting band edge relationships but also holds favorable transport properties, excellent optical absorption across the visible light spectrum, and spontaneous oxygen production under neutral conditions. More excitingly, under application of a 7% biaxial tensile strain modulation with an ideal biaxial strength of 32.35 GPa nm, the Ca(BiO2)2 monolayer not only maintains its structural integrity but also exhibits a completely spontaneous reaction for photocatalytic hydrogen precipitation with superior optical absorption. This can primarily be attributed to the substantial reduction of the potential barrier through strain engineering as well as the weakening of bond energy resulting from changes of the adsorption site as calculated by crystal orbital Hamiltonian population analysis. This flexible stretchable electronic modulated the photocatalyst behavior and bond energy of O–Bi and O–Ca interactions, offering outstanding potential for photocatalytic water spontaneous oxygen and hydrogen evolution among all of the reported metal oxides, and is more likely to become a promising candidate for future flexible electronic devices.

Abstract The modulation of the coordination environment of single atom catalysts (SACs) plays a vital role in promoting CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). Herein, N or B doped Fe‐embedded graphyne (Fe‐GY), Fe‐nXGYm ( n = 1, 2, 3; X = N, B; m = 1, 2, 3), are employed as probes to reveal the effect of the coordination environment engineering on CO 2 RR performance via heteroatom doping in SACs. The results show that the doping position and number of N or B in Fe‐GY significantly affects catalyst activity and CO 2 RR product selectivity. In comparison, Fe‐1NGY exhibits high‐performance CO 2 RR to CH 4 with a low limiting potential of −0.17 V, and Fe‐2NGY3 is demonstrated as an excellent CO 2 RR electrocatalyst for producing HCOOH with a low limiting potential of −0.16 V. With applied potential, Fe‐GY, Fe‐1NGY, and Fe‐2NGY3 exhibit significant advantages in CO 2 RR to CH 4 while hydrogen evolution reaction is inhibited. The intrinsic essence analysis illustrates that heteroatom doping modulates the electronic structure of active sites and regulates the adsorption strength of the intermediates, thereby rendering a favorable coordination environment for CO 2 RR. This work highlights Fe‐nXGYm as outstanding SACs for CO 2 RR, and provides an in‐depth insight into the intrinsic essence of the promotion effect from heteroatom doping.

Introduction: Orthopaedic applicants have increased the average number of publications on their residency application to compete with the growing competitiveness of the field. The purpose of this study was to assess whether research productivity before orthopaedic residency and caliber of one's institution is correlated with academic productivity during residency. Methods: Scopus was used to extract publication metrics. Quantity and quality (how often the publications were cited) were analyzed at 2 different time periods: before and during residency. All subjects in the study had graduated an ACGME-accredited orthopaedic surgery residency in 2021. Military residents, international medical graduates, and residents not listed on their department's website were excluded. Residents were categorized as both high (≥2 publications) or low (<2 publications) publishers according to their pre-residency publications. They were also categorized based on their program's Jones et al. research productivity ranking. Results: For the 758 residents, the median number of publications was 0 (Interquartile Range [IQR]: 0-2) and 3 (IQR: 1-6) before and during residency, respectively. High publishing medical students had more publications during training than low publishers (6 [IQR: 3-14] and 2 [IQR: 1-4], p < 0.001). Residents at higher ranked programs also had more publications (4 [IQR: 2-9] and 2 [IQR: 0-4], p < 0.001). High publishing students now training at lower ranked institutions had more publications during residency than low publishers who trained at more productive institutions (4 [IQR: 1-9] and 3 [IQR: 1-6], p < 0.001). Conclusion: Having 2 or more publications before residency is correlated with an increased number of publications during residency. While attending a higher academically productive program is associated with increased resident publications, a high publishing medical student would be expected to have more publications during residency than a low publishing student, regardless of program rank. Notably, most matched applicants continue to have zero publications before matriculation.

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), especially high-efficiency activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS), have aroused great attention based on their excellent performance along with low toxicity in the degradation of organic pollutants. Although covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been explored for PMS-activated AOPs, their intrinsic photocatalytic properties are rarely studied in this field. Herein, we designed and prepared a fully conjugated carbon covalent organic framework (TFPT-TCPB COF), which features sp2 C═C linkages, triazine units, and nitrile groups, showing great photocatalytic potential to activation of PMS as an intrinsic photocatalyst. Olefin-linked TFPT-TCPB COF showed much higher removal efficiency (k = 0.048 min–1), 3.5 times the value of rate constant k of TFPT-TAPB COF (k = 0.014 min–1). Meanwhile, the photoactive triazine units endowed the TFPT-TCPB COF with 2.5 times enhancement of the k value than TFPB-TCPB COF embedding only benzene rings (k = 0.013 min–1). Furthermore, the reaction constant k for TFPT-TCPB COF-COOH reached 0.081 min–1, which was 69% higher than that of TFPT-TCPB COF and 27 times higher than that of g-C3N4, proving the positive effects of introducing the hydrophilic carboxyl groups. Also, high chemical stability, reusability, and low biotoxicity offered it an opportunity as a marvelous metal-free photocatalyst for environment remediation.

Exploring efficient non-precious metal sulfides as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial. Cobalt disulfide (CoS2) has gained attention for its favorable intrinsic activity, impressive metal conductivity, and cost-effectiveness. However, the weak adsorption of H* at the sulfur (S) sites on the surface of CoS2 leaves room for enhancing its HER intrinsic activity. Vacancy engineering emerges as a valuable strategy to modulate the local charge density, optimizing hydrogen adsorption free energy and catalytic performance in HER. Taking advantage of plasma technology, known for its rapid and efficient defect creation, we synthesized porous CoS2 nanowire arrays enriched with S vacancies (Vs-CoS2/CC) through Ar plasma treatment. Notably, at a current density of 10 mA cm−2, Vs-CoS2/CC exhibits a lower overpotential (170 mV) compared to pure CoS2/CC (236 mV). Furthermore, Vs-CoS2/CC demonstrates exceptional electrochemical stability. Experimental data and density functional theory calculations jointly reveal that introducing S vacancies reduces local charge density around S atoms, activating inert sulfur sites and enhancing the intrinsic activity of CoS2 for HER. This study introduces a novel concept of defect-engineered activation in metal compound catalysts, employing a plasma approach to advance HER performance.

We present the first comprehensive investigation of transition metal-substituted Hydroxyapatite (TM-HAP) materials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Density functional theory (DFT) was used to study in a systematic manner the stability of 3d, 4d, 5d transition metal dopants on the HAP (000̅1) surface, analyzing their stability, activity, and selectivity for photocatalytic CO2RR. DFT results allowed to narrow down the selection to three transition metal elements (Co, Ni, Mo) based on their structural stability, band structure and performance. A selective analysis of product formation for carbon monoxide and formate was made, showing that TM dopants facilitate the initial protonation step in the CO2 reduction by adsorbing H2 molecule on TM atoms and then dissociating it into two hydrogen atoms. The performance of Ni- and Co-HAP towards the reaction activity is consistent with experimental results. Mo-HAP stands as a new and attractive photocatalyst for further investigation, given its excellent predicted performance.

Electrochemical membrane technology has been identified as a promising technology for sustainable chemical and energy production due to its potential to address several challenges in the production of chemicals and energy, including energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste generation. Electrochemical membrane processes can be applied to produce a wide range of feedstocks, including gases, liquids, and solids. This versatility can enable the coproduction of multiple chemicals and energy products from various feedstocks. In this chapter, the production of chemicals and energy, including bioelectricity, biomethane, biohydrogen, bioethanol, hydrogen peroxide, biodegradable electronics and biosensors, dry air from humid air, air separation into nitrogen and oxygen gases, organic solvent extraction, CO2 and H2 separation from gas mixtures, plasma generation, dewatered microalgae biomass, and purified microalgae-based products, are discussed. Electrochemical membrane processes can offer environmental benefits, such as CO2 reduction, leading to more sustainable and socially responsible production practices. The electrochemical conversion of CO2 can lead to the production of valuable chemicals, such as ethanol. With continued research and development, electrochemical membrane technology is expected to play an increasingly important role in chemical and energy production.
