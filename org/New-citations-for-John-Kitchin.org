Electrochemical conversion of CH4 to easily transportable and value-added liquid fuels is highly attractive for energy-efficient CH4 utilization, but it is challenging due to the low reactivity and solubility of CH4 in the electrolyte. Herein, we report a high-pressure electro-Fenton (HPEF) strategy to establish a hetero-homogeneous process for the electrocatalytic conversion of CH4 by O2 at room temperature. In combination with elevation of reactant pressure to accelerate reaction kinetics, it delivers an unprecedented HCOOH productivity of 11.5 mmol h–1 gFe–1 with 220 times enhancement compared to that under ambient pressure. Remarkably, an HCOOH Faradic efficiency of 81.4% can be achieved with an ultralow cathodic overpotential of 0.38 V. The elevated pressure not only promotes the electrocatalytic reduction of O2 to H2O2 but also increases the reaction collision probability between CH4 and •OH, which is in situ generated from the Fe2+-facilitated decomposition of H2O2.

Abstract Effective electrocatalysts with high activity and selectivity for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction to multi-carbon (C 2+ ) products are still lacking. CO dimerization to C 2+ products such as ethylene and ethanol can be achieved on Cu-based catalysts, but direct coupling to ethane (C 2 H 6 ) has not been realized. Here, we show high selectivity of CO 2 to C 2 H 6 at room temperature and ambient pressure. Specifically, we report both experimental and theoretical findings for the Ti 2 N electrocatalyst, that exhibits the highest reported Faradaic efficiency (FE) for C 2 H 6 (~ 46.8%) at a current density of 25 mA cm − 2 and potential of -1.44 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with ethane energy efficiency of ~ 20%. We achieve this outstanding performance via an alternative reaction pathway, where the *CH 3 OH adsorbed species are stabilized on the catalyst surface, which facilitates the production of C 2 H 6 through the *CH 3 OH coupling mechanism as corroborated by density functional theory (DFT). We demonstrate that the high selectivity is accompanied by excellent catalytic, structural, and electronic stability as evidenced by XAS, TEM, FTIR and SEM measurements. These groundbreaking chemistry advancements and catalysts unveil uncharted avenues for converting CO 2 into liquid fuels and chemicals.

Photocatalytic CO2 reduction holds great potential for alleviating global energy and environmental issues, where the electronic structure of the catalytic center plays a crucial role. However, the spin state, a key descriptor of electronic properties, is largely overlooked. Herein, we present a simple strategy to regulate the spin states of catalytic Co centers by changing their coordination environment by exchanging the Co species into a stable Zn-based metal–organic framework (MOF) to afford Co-OAc, Co-Br, and Co-CN for CO2 photoreduction. Experimental and DFT calculation results suggest that the distinct spin states of the Co sites give rise to different charge separation abilities and energy barriers for CO2 adsorption/activation in photocatalysis. Consequently, the optimized Co-OAc with the highest spin-state Co sites presents an excellent photocatalytic CO2 activity of 2325.7 μmol·g–1·h–1 and selectivity of 99.1% to CO, which are among the best in all reported MOF photocatalysts, in the absence of a noble metal and additional photosensitizer. This work underlines the potential of MOFs as an ideal platform for spin-state manipulation toward improved photocatalysis.

Difficult dynamical transfer behaviors for charge carriers from generation locations to corresponding reductive and oxidative sites as well as subsequent their splitting H2O with large reaction overpotential have not been solved yet, which seriously impedes the conversion efficiency of solar energy into H2 (STH). Herein, nanocage-like g-C3N4 (C3N4NC) supported Ni2P nanoparticles (Ni2P/C3N4NC) have been constructed for solving the above dynamical bottleneck by synchronously regulating d- and p-band centers using the strain effect. Photo-excited electrons and holes are separately propelled to reductive site (Ni2P) and oxidative site (C3N4NC) within the localized electric field for *-OH dehydrogenation and *-O coupling in the photocatalytic H2O splitting along with an STH of 2.52 % at 65°C under AM 1.5 G irradiation, being explored by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Hall effect tests. The research explores a unique insight to boost STH over heterojunction photocatalysts by synchronously regulating their d- and p-band centers.

Despite extensive studies of hydrogen spillover on single-atom alloy surfaces, a thorough understanding of the structure–activity relationship is still lacking. Here, we investigate H2 dissociation and diffusion of the dissociated H species on the near-surface alloys embedded with single Pt atoms using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The DFT results indicate that subsurface alloying with early transition metals (X) (Pt1-X/Cu(111)) can generally promote the initial hydrogen spillover but suppress the H2 dissociation process, showing an intractable trade-off effect. While the DFT-calculated H2 dissociation barrier on Pt1-Co/Cu(111) is higher than that on Pt1-Ni/Cu(111), the AIMD results show that the H2 dissociation probability on the Pt1-Co/Cu(111) surface is much higher than that on Pt1-Ni/Cu(111). The trajectory analysis shows that H2 molecules on Pt1-Co/Cu(111) can adopt a more convenient conformation for dissociation when approaching the so-called close-range physisorption zone (CPZ) due to the relatively flat topography of the potential energy surface, thus increasing the H2 dissociation probability compared to the case on Pt1-Ni/Cu(111). This work provides a clear picture for understanding the structure–activity relationships of H2 activation and hydrogen spillover over single-atom catalysts. More importantly, it highlights an overlooked but essential role of the dynamic orientation of the reactant in heterogeneous catalysis.

The development of Pt-based catalysts for use in fuel cells that meet performance targets of high activity, maximized stability, and low cost remains a huge challenge. Herein, we report a nitrogen (N)-doped high-entropy alloy (HEA) electrocatalyst that consists of a Pt-rich shell and a N-doped PtCoFeNiCu core on a carbon support (denoted as N–Pt/HEA/C). The N–Pt/HEA/C catalyst showed a high mass activity of 1.34 A mgPt–1 at 0.9 V for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in rotating disk electrode (RDE) testing, which substantially outperformed commercial Pt/C and most of the other binary/ternary Pt-based catalysts. The N–Pt/HEA/C catalyst also demonstrated excellent stability in both RDE and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) testing. Using operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements and theoretical calculations, we revealed that the enhanced ORR activity of N–Pt/HEA/C originated from the optimized adsorption energy of intermediates, resulting in the tailored electronic structure formed upon N-doping. Furthermore, we showed that the multiple metal–nitrogen bonds formed synergistically improved the corrosion resistance of the 3d transition metals and enhanced the ORR durability.

Among water electrolysis methods, proton exchange membrane electrolyzers (PEMWEs) stand out for their potential to generate high-purity hydrogen with remarkable efficiency and dynamic response, making them a cornerstone technology for the sustainable hydrogen economy. However, a key bottleneck lies in the slow reaction rate of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode, a four-electron transfer process that significantly throttles the system's full potential. This significantly impacts overall efficiency and calls for unfolding stable, durable, and highly active electrocatalysts that are cost-effective. However, the inherent acidity generated by the OER itself complicates this task. Noble metal catalysts like iridium (Ir) and ruthenium (Rh), pure or combined with other elements, exhibit excellent activity in the acidic OER environment. However, their high cost hinders large-scale PEMWE deployment. Therefore, extensive research has concentrated on non-noble metal alternatives, particularly transition metal oxides (monometallic and polymetallic) and carbon-based materials. This comprehensive review meticulously examines the emerging progress in non-noble metal electrocatalysts designed for low-pH OER conditions within PEMWEs. Following an introductory classification of water electrolyzer technologies, it explores how factors such as structure and synthesis route modulate the crucial performance parameters across diverse catalyst groups. Drawing upon these insights, the review also evaluates the current challenges and outlines promising avenues for future research.

In recent years, heteroatom-doped carbon nanomaterials without metal possess great potential in oxygen evolution reactions (OER). However, the synthesis process is complex and the energy waste is large (i.e. calcination). Molecular electrocatalysts, as a new type of electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution, have attracted a wide amount of attention. In this work, taurine (TA) was selected as an OER electrocatalyst, and the catalytic activity of TA was studied via theoretical calculations and experiment. The DFT results show that the OH in the electrolyte tends to adsorb on C or N and takes away the H atom on the amino group to form uncoordinated N atoms in TA molecules. In addition, the TA molecule is fixed in a conductive hydrogel with a hydrophilic surface, and the conductive network on the hydrogel further accelerates charge and mass transfer in the OER process. Therefore, this work opens the way for further research on molecular electrocatalysts.

High efficiency electrocatalysts play a crucial role for clean and green hydrogen energy. Here, the catalytic performance of Mo atom anchored on graphene surfaces regulated by non-metal (X = B, P, S, N) for water splitting and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) is investigated by the first principles of density functional theory (DFT). The structural and electronical properties calculation demonstrated that the stable Mo@X4C systems can be created where covalent bond is formed between Mo and X atoms. It is also found that the adsorption ability of H2O on Mo@X4C (X = B, P, S, N) surfaces are directly related to d-band centers of Mo atoms. In water splitting process, the splitting reaction energy barrier of H2O has the trend of Mo@B4C < Mo@P4C < Mo@S4C < Mo@N4C. Significant orbital hybridization coupling and charge transfer occur between adsorbed H2O molecule and Mo@X4C surfaces. Specifically, the Mo@B4C catalyst is predicted to exhibit not only promising splitting activity, but also superior high performance for HER. And the value of ΔGH* is 0.04 eV, which is very close to ideal zero. Thus, it can be recommended as a stable, low-cost and superior performance catalyst for hydrogen production. Lower Bader charge of Mo and larger work function both facilitate the release of hydrogen. It reveals that non-metallic coordination regulation serves as promising way to design high performance electrocatalysts for water splitting and hydrogen production.

The advancement of large-scale hydrogen production and its application via electrocatalytic water splitting heavily relies on progress in developing highly active inexpensive, and efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER), which continues to pose a significant challenge. Herein, we prepare GO@ZIF-67@MnFe with embedded iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) nanoparticles on graphene oxide (GO) decorated with a zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-67) using a facile and cost-effective method. The as-prepared GO@ZIF-67@MnFe catalyst exhibits remarkable electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of only 236 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm–2, a small Tafel slope of 55.7 mV dec–1, and robust durability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. Additionally, we conduct a systematic study to investigate the electrocatalytic OER activity of ZIF-67, ZIF-67@Mn, ZIF-67@Fe, and ZIF-67@MnFe using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The experimental and DFT calculation results suggest that the introduction of Fe and Mn to ZIF-67 improves OER performance by reducing the activation energy barrier and accelerating kinetics. This study presents a promising strategy and rational design methodology for the developing multi-metallic catalysts utilizing ZIF derivatives for water splitting.

Borohydrides offer promise as potential carriers for hydrogen storage due to their high hydrogen concentration. However, the strong chemical bonding within borohydrides poses challenges for efficient hydrogen release during usage and restricts the re-hydrogenation process when attempting to regenerate the material. These high thermodynamic and kinetic barriers present obstacles in achieving reversible de-hydrogenation and re-hydrogenation of borohydrides, impeding their practical application in hydrogen storage systems. Employing density functional theory calculations, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the influence of transition metals on both the BH4 cluster, a fundamental building block of borohydrides, and pure boron, which is formed as the end product following hydrogen release. Our research reveals correlations among the d-band center, work function, and surface energy of 3d and 4d transition metals. These correlations are directly linked to the weakening of bonding within the BH4 cluster when adsorbed on catalyst surfaces. On the other hand, we also explore how various intrinsic properties of transition metals influence the formation of boron vacancies and the hydrogen bonding process. By establishing a comprehensive correlation between the weakening of sp3 hybridization in the BH4 cluster and the sp2 hybridization in boron, we facilitate the identification and screening of optimal candidates capable of achieving reversible de-hydrogenation and re-hydrogenation in borohydrides.

Abstract The electrochemical reduction of CO 2 into C 2+ products represents a promising solution to completing the carbon cycle, thereby fostering a sustainable energy supply. Single‐atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) have garnered significant attention as efficient electrocatalysts for the CO 2 reduction reaction. Herein, we carried out a first‐principles study on the mechanism of C−C bond formation on single‐Cu‐atom‐modified covalent triazine frameworks (Cu‐CTFs), which are a promising platform for SAECs. Static density functional calculations indicated that the dimerization of CO, which is the main mechanism for C−C bond formation on bulk Cu metals, was not favorable for Cu‐CTFs because of the lack of adjacent Cu sites for co‐adsorption of CO molecules. Rather than CO dimerization, the reaction between adsorbed *CHO and CO to produce *COCHO has a relatively low reaction energy barrier. Constrained ab initio molecular dynamics analyses revealed that the C−C bond‐forming reaction proceeds via insertion of CO at the *CHO intermediate, which has a modest activation energy of 0.09 eV. Specifically, when CO molecule is constrained to be brought close to *CHO, CO insertion between *CHO and Cu occurs at a C−C distance of 1.8 Å. This insertion reaction is the transition step for this C−C bond formation.

Abstract The electrocatalytic preparation of hydrogen at different pH values not only achieves excellent device performance but also promotes the application of reactive oxygen species (ROS) clearance and hydrogen anti‐inflammation. However, it is difficult to develop materials that simultaneously achieve these excellent properties. Herein, the preparation of beaded necklace‐like Co 9 Se 8 microspheres using a general and facile synthetic strategy is reported. The Co 9 Se 8 ‐modified electrode has three applications: efficient water splitting for enhanced performance, ROS scavenging, and hydrogen anti‐inflammatory activity. Experiments, high‐angle‐annular‐dark‐field scanning transmission electron microscopy, and density functional theory calculations indicate that the reconstructed Co(OH) 2 plays a vital role in the oxygen evolution reaction and that the transition from *O to *OOH is the actual rate‐determining step. The Co 9 Se 8 material, with its unique beaded necklace‐like structure, exhibits exceptional hydrogen production capabilities in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4). In particular, hydrogen produce under neutral conditions can effectively reduce ROS levels and significantly inhibit inflammation‐related pathological processes, playing a unique antioxidant and anti‐inflammatory role at the cellular level. The obtained results indicate that the as‐synthesized Co 9 Se 8 is more suitable for water splitting, ROS scavenging, and hydrogen anti‐inflammatory applications, outperforming other transition metal electrodes and rendering practical industrial and clinical applications.

Clarifying the structure–reactivity relationship of non-noble-metal electrocatalysts is one of the decisive factors for the practical application of water electrolysis. In this field, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a sluggish kinetic process has become a huge challenge for large-scale production of high-purity hydrogen. Here we synthesize a layered quasi-nevskite metastable-phase cobalt oxide (LQNMP-Co2O3) nanosheet via a simple molten alkali synthesis strategy. The unit-cell parameters of LQNMP-Co2O3 are determined to be a = b = 2.81 Å and c = 6.89 Å with a space group of P3̅m1 (No. 164). The electrochemical results show that the LQNMP-Co2O3 electrocatalyst enables delivering an ultralow overpotential of 266 mV at a current density of 10 mA cmgeo–2 with excellent durability. The operando XANES and EXAFS analyses clearly reveal the origin of the OER activity and the electrochemical stability of the LQNMP-Co2O3 electrocatalyst. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations show that the energy barrier of the rate-determining step (RDS) (from *O to *OOH) is significantly reduced on the LQNMP-Co2O3 electrocatalyst by comparing with simulated monolayered CoO2 (M-CoO2).

In this work, we advanced an efficient free energy sampling method based on constrained ab initio molecular dynamics (cAIMD) with a fully explicit solvent layer to depict the electrochemical reaction process at constant surface charge density, named the “Constant-Potential Thermodynamic Integration (CPTI)” method. For automatically adjusting surface charge density at different states, we built an “on-the-fly” procedure which is capable of managing all the necessary steps during cAIMD simulations, including the system pre-equilibrium, surface charge density updating, and force sampling. We applied it to predict the potential-dependent free energy profiles of CO2 adsorption on a single-atom catalyst. The results show that our method can not only account for changes in electrostatic potential energy associated with potential but also consider the potential-induced solvation effects. Our approach enables the accurate simulation of electrochemical environment by presenting the complete solid–liquid interface and efficient computation of electrocatalytic reaction energetics based on a robust potential descriptor.

The electro-oxidation of hydrazine is important for direct hydrazine fuel cells and for fundamental understanding of electrocatalysis in the nitrogen cycle. In this Review, we discuss electrocatalysis of the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR), spanning a vast range of metal surfaces, nanoparticles, atomically dispersed ions, organometallic macrocycles, and enzymes. Emphasis is given to structure–activity correlations and reactivity descriptors, including the formulation of the Zagal principle, an electrochemical corollary of the Sabatier principle. In addition, we identify overarching themes that span the different subfields of HzOR electrocatalysis, hoping to inspire cross-disciplinary research avenues.

Inspired by photo-enzyme-coupled catalytic system in chloroplasts, we developed a composite catalyst with both photocatalytic and biomimetic catalytic activity for H2O2 production by loading gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, enzyme mimics) on graphite carbon nitride (GCN, photocatalyst) nanosheets using polyethyleneimine (PEI) as the “bridge”. The introduction of PEI and AuNPs can adjust the electronic structure of GCN, facilitating the rapid separation of photogenerated carriers. Moreover, surface plasmon resonance of AuNPs excited by incident light promotes the activation of glucose molecules, elevating their reactivity with O2, thereby improving the glucose oxidase-mimicking catalytic production of H2O2. Furthermore, the grafting of PEI and the addition of glucose enhance the O2 adsorption on the catalyst surface. Thus, both biomimetic catalytic and photocatalytic reduction of O2 to H2O2 are boosted, achieving a significant synergistic enhancement effect of 175%. This study provided a novel design strategy for catalysts and a green routine for efficient H2O2 production.

Electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (e-NRR) is an attractive approach to produce NH3 because of the ambient conditions and abundant reactants. However, the catalytic performance of e-NRR catalysts is still insufficient, and far from replacing traditional method in NH3 synthesis. In this work, we study a series of Cu-based single-atom alloys, including 17 doped single transition metal (TM) atoms and 4 exposed surfaces with different Miller indices, through first-principles calculations, and finally identify five candidates (Re1-Cu(100), Re1-Cu(111), Os1-Cu(110), Os1-Cu(211), and W1-Cu(111)) with low limiting potential (-0.35 V, -0.38 V, -0.48 V, -0.49 V, and -0.42 V, respectively) as well as remarkable inhibition of the hydrogen evolution reaction for e-NRR. Our study indicates that the outstanding activity of the five candidates is caused by the strong coupling between the TM-d orbitals and the N2-2p orbitals. Furthermore, these catalysts also exhibit long-term stability. This work develops a universal strategy for the rapid screening and identification of highly efficient e-NRR catalysts.

The effects of dopant on surface electronic structure, conductivity, and thermodynamic barrier of reaction are addressed and discussed. For the OER, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis shows that electron transferring from the Ni to the dopants enhances the catalytic performance of the sulfide. Cu doped NiFe sulfide exhibits the best OER performance. For the ORR, density functional theory calculation indicates that Ti, V, Mn, Co, and Cu upshift the d‐band center (ɛ d ), while Cr downshifts the ɛ d . Among the dopants, V leads to optimized electronic structure modification, giving optimized adsorption energy of *O on the Ni, the lowest rate determining step ΔG 1 , and the best ORR activity. By considering E 10 ‐E 1/2 together with the maximum current density of the OER and limited diffusion current density of the ORR, NiFeVS exhibits the best OER/ORR bifunctionality. The performance of NiFeVS as a cathodic catalyst has also been evaluated in a zinc air battery, demonstrating a specific capacity of 698 mAh g −1 , maximum power density of 190 mW cm −2 , and a superior cycle stability of 2400 cycles (400 h).

Intercalation (ic) of metal atoms into the van der Waals (vdW) gap of layered materials constitutes a facile strategy to create materials whose properties can be tuned via the concentration of the intercalated atoms. Here we perform systematic density functional theory calculations to explore various properties of an emergent class of crystalline 2D materials (ic-2D materials) comprising vdW homobilayers with native metal atoms on a sublattice of intercalation sites. From an initial set of 1348 ic-2D materials, generated from 77 vdW homobilayers, we find 95 structures with good thermodynamic stability (formation energy within 200 meV/atom of the convex hull). A significant fraction of the semiconducting host materials are found to undergo an insulator to metal transition upon self-intercalation, with only PdS2, PdSe2, and GeS2 maintaining a finite electronic gap. In five cases, self-intercalation introduces magnetism. In general, self-intercalation is found to promote metallicity and enhance the chemical reactivity on the basal plane. Based on the calculated H binding energy, we find that self-intercalated SnS2 and Hf3Te2 are promising candidates for hydrogen evolution catalysis. All the stable ic-2D structures and their calculated properties can be explored in the open C2DB database.

We present the first comprehensive investigation of transition metal-substituted Hydroxyapatite (TM-HAP) materials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Density functional theory (DFT) was used to study in a systematic manner the stability of 3d, 4d, 5d transition metal dopants on the HAP (000̅1) surface, analyzing their stability, activity, and selectivity for photocatalytic CO2RR. DFT results allowed to narrow down the selection to three transition metal elements (Co, Ni, Mo) based on their structural stability, band structure and performance. A selective analysis of product formation for carbon monoxide and formate was made, showing that TM dopants facilitate the initial protonation step in the CO2 reduction by adsorbing H2 molecule on TM atoms and then dissociating it into two hydrogen atoms. The performance of Ni- and Co-HAP towards the reaction activity is consistent with experimental results. Mo-HAP stands as a new and attractive photocatalyst for further investigation, given its excellent predicted performance.

Electrochemical membrane technology has been identified as a promising technology for sustainable chemical and energy production due to its potential to address several challenges in the production of chemicals and energy, including energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste generation. Electrochemical membrane processes can be applied to produce a wide range of feedstocks, including gases, liquids, and solids. This versatility can enable the coproduction of multiple chemicals and energy products from various feedstocks. In this chapter, the production of chemicals and energy, including bioelectricity, biomethane, biohydrogen, bioethanol, hydrogen peroxide, biodegradable electronics and biosensors, dry air from humid air, air separation into nitrogen and oxygen gases, organic solvent extraction, CO2 and H2 separation from gas mixtures, plasma generation, dewatered microalgae biomass, and purified microalgae-based products, are discussed. Electrochemical membrane processes can offer environmental benefits, such as CO2 reduction, leading to more sustainable and socially responsible production practices. The electrochemical conversion of CO2 can lead to the production of valuable chemicals, such as ethanol. With continued research and development, electrochemical membrane technology is expected to play an increasingly important role in chemical and energy production.
