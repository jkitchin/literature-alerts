Stabilizing active PtNi alloy catalyst toward oxygen reduction reaction is essential for fuel cell. Doping of specific metals is an empirical strategy, however, the atomistic insight into how dopant boosts the stability of PtNi catalyst still remains elusive. Here, with typical examples of Mo and Au dopants, we identify the distinct roles of Mo and Au in stabilizing PtNi nanowires catalysts. Specifically, due to the stronger interaction between atomic orbital for Ni-Mo and Pt-Au, the Mo dopant mainly suppresses the outward diffusion of Ni atoms while the Au dopant contributes to the stabilization of surface Pt overlayer. Inspired by this atomistic understanding, we rationally construct the PtNiMoAu nanowires by integrating the different functions of Mo and Au into one entity. Such catalyst assembled in fuel cell cathode thus presents both remarkable activity and durability, even surpassing the United States Department of Energy technical targets for 2025.

Sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as the half reaction of water electrolysis hindered the production of clean hydrogen, necessitates a cost-effective electrocatalyst. Spinel nickel cobaltite (NiCo2O4), characterized by its lower cost, flexibility in oxidation states of cations, and stable spinel structure, holds promise as an OER electrocatalyst. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of its intrinsic electrochemical activity, conductivity, and active surface area. Inspired by the flexible valence states of Ni and Co, in this study, CeO2 was introduced into NiCo2O4 for further electronic structure adjustment. The result was the synthesis of an urchin-like NiCo2O4@CeO2 (NCOC), and the elucidation of its formation mechanisms, expressed conclusively through reaction formulas. NCOC, characterized by an open architecture and a rough surface, ensures rapid mass transportation and charge diffusion. Within NCOC, numerous oxophilic Ce3+ sites with oxygen vacancies construct electron transport pathways, accelerating charge-transfer. This simultaneously induces an increase in the oxidation states and proportions of Ni3+ and Co3+ in NCOC, reinforcing the covalence of Ni–O and Co–O bonds, expediting the ad/desorption of intermediates during OER. The electronic structure variations of NCOC were further verified through density functional theory (DFT) analyses, revealing alterations in adsorption configurations of intermediates and a decrease in adsorption free energies for intermediates on NCOC during OER. In practical terms, NCOC demonstrated a low overpotential of 228 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 under 1 M KOH, maintaining long-term electrochemical stability for 100 h. Overall, this study provides a universal approach for designing highly cost-efficient electrocatalysts for OER.

In this study, we investigated the effect of Vo on the magnetic and photocatalytic properties of bilayer anatase TiO2 (001): C/N/S using first principles within the density functional theory framework. Through research, it has been discovered that the stability and electronic structure of oxygen vacancies can vary depending on their positions, ultimately resulting in diverse photocatalytic performances. When the distance between N and Vo is relatively close, bilayer TiO2(001) system exhibited a relatively low formation energy under Ti-rich conditions, a high cohesive energy, and no virtual frequency formed in the phonon spectrum. Thus, it has good stability. The bilayer Ti24O46N (001) system displayed the most evident red shift in the absorption spectrum, the largest electric dipole moment, the smallest work function, relatively high carrier activity, a notable difference in mobility between electrons and holes, reduced recombination of electrons and holes, an extended carrier lifetime, and superior oxidation reaction capability. Consequently, the bilayer Ti24O46N (001) surface system emerged as the most suitable catalyst for the photo-degradation of water to produce oxygen.

A high performance and durable electrocatalyst for the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers is crucial for the emerging hydrogen economy. Herein, we synthesized Pt–C core-shell nanoparticles (core: Pt nanoparticles, shell: N-containing carbon) were uniformly coated on hierarchical MoS2/GNF using pyrolysis of h-MoS2/GNF with a Pt-aniline complex. The synthesized Pt–C core-shell@h-MoS2/GNF (with 11.3 % Pt loading) showed HER activity with a lower overpotential of 30 mV at 10 mA cm−2 as compared to the benchmark catalyst 20 % Pt–C (41 mV at 10 mA cm−2) with improved durability over 94 h at 10 mA cm−2. Furthermore, we investigated the structural stability and hydrogen adsorption energy for Pt13 cluster, C90 molecule, h-MoS2 sheet, Pt13–C90 core-shell, and Pt13–C90 core-shell deposited h-MoS2 sheets using density functional theory (DFT) simulations. We investigated the Pt–C core-shell@h-MoS2/GNF catalyst active sites during HER performance using in-situ Raman analysis as well as DFT. We fabricated anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzers with cathode catalysts of Pt–C core-shell@h-MoS2/GNF and evaluated device performance with 0.1 and 1.0 M KOH at 20 and 60 °C. Our work provides a new pathway to design core-shell electrocatalysts for use in AEM water electrolyzers to generate green hydrogen.

Structural diversification of lead molecules is a key component of drug discovery to explore chemical space. Late-stage functionalizations (LSFs) are versatile methodologies capable of installing functional handles on richly decorated intermediates to deliver numerous diverse products in a single reaction. Predicting the regioselectivity of LSF is still an open challenge in the field. Numerous efforts from chemoinformatics and machine learning (ML) groups have made strides in this area. However, it is arduous to isolate and characterize the multitude of LSF products generated, limiting available data and hindering pure ML approaches. We report the development of an approach that combines a message passing neural network and 13C NMR-based transfer learning to predict the atom-wise probabilities of functionalization for Minisci and P450-based functionalizations. We validated our model both retrospectively and with a series of prospective experiments, showing that it accurately predicts the outcomes of Minisci-type and P450 transformations and outperforms the well-established Fukui-based reactivity indices and other machine learning reactivity-based algorithms.

Abstract Ni‐Sb‐SnO 2 (Ni‐ATO) can generate ozone electrochemically which compensates the energy efficiency. However, the selectivity of electrochemical ozone production (EOP) on Ni‐ATO surface is yet insufficient for practical application. In this study, ATO with Cu and Ni co‐doped (CuNi‐ATO) is prepared to enhance the electrochemical performance and stability of ozone generation. CuNi‐ATO achieves the highest known current efficiency of 71% for EOP under acidic conditions, which is 2.4 times higher than that of Ni‐ATO. Efficient EOP is maintained with diverse pH, temperature, and electrolytes. Notably, the service lifetime of CuNi‐ATO is 2.7 times longer than that of Ni‐ATO. DFT calculations further reveal that ATO with Cu and Ni co‐doped presents weakened adsorption toward O*, O 2 *, and O 3 *. The spontaneous combination of O* and O 2 * is the main reason for enhanced EOP capacity on CuNi‐ATO. This work provides a novel insight into designing materials for efficient ozone production.

Abstract Zinc–air batteries (ZABs) hold potential as clean, cost‐effective, and sustainable energy storage system for the next generation. However, the application of ZABs remains challenging because of their poor rechargeability and low efficiency . The design of efficient bifunctional catalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharging and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charging is essential to developing rechargeable ZABs. Transition metal (TM)‐doped carbon (TM‐C) materials stand out from all the available bifunctional catalysts due to the excellent specific surface area, diverse morphological structures , and the multiple metal active sites formed after TM doping. This paper, therefore, focuses on the synthesis, electrochemical properties, and potential mechanism of TM‐C catalysts. To make a novelty and logical statement, the voltage difference (Δ E = E i = 10 − E 1/2 ) between the ORR/OER catalytic process is employed to categorize different TM‐C catalysts reported in recent years, which are divided into two groups: I (Δ E = 0.7 − 0.9 V) and II (Δ E = 0.5 − 0.7 V). The catalytic mechanisms of bifunctional catalysts are clarified. More ways and ideas for synthesizing high‐performance bifunctional TM‐C catalysts are also provided. Finally, the current problem and prospects of this group materials are presented.

Addressing the urgent need for sustainable energy sources, this study investigates the intricate relationship between rhodium (Rh5) nanoclusters and TiO2 rutile (110) surfaces, aiming to advance photocatalytic water splitting for green hydrogen production. Motivated by the imperative to transition from conventional fossil fuels, this study employs density functional theory (DFT) with DFT-D3 and HSE06 hybrid functionals to analyse the geometrical stabilities and electronic structures of Rh5 nanoclusters on TiO2 rutile (110). TiO2, a prominent photocatalyst, faces challenges such as limited visible light absorption, leading researchers to explore noble metals like Rh as cocatalysts. Our results show that bipyramidal Rh5 nanoclusters exhibit enhanced stability and charge transfer when adsorbed on TiO2 rutile (110) compared to trapezoidal configurations. The most stable adsorption induces the oxidation of the nanocluster, altering the electronic structure of TiO2. Extending the analysis to defective TiO2 surfaces, this study explores the impact of Rh5 nanoclusters on oxygen vacancy formation, revealing the stabilisation of TiO2 and increased oxygen vacancy formation energy. This theoretical exploration contributes insights into the potential of Rh5 nanoclusters as efficient cocatalysts for TiO2-based photocatalytic systems, laying the foundation for experimental validations and the rational design of highly efficient photocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production. The observed effects on electronic structures and oxygen vacancy formation emphasize the complex interactions between Rh5 nanoclusters and the TiO2 surface, guiding future research in the quest for clean energy alternatives.

Low-temperature plasma catalysis has shown promise for various chemical processes such as light hydrocarbon conversion, volatile organic compounds removal, and ammonia synthesis. Plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis has the potential advantages of leveraging renewable energy and distributed manufacturing principles to mitigate the pressing environmental challenges of the energy-intensive Haber-Bosh process, towards sustainable ammonia production. However, lack of foundational understanding of plasma-catalyst interactions poses a key challenge to optimizing plasma-catalytic processes. Recent studies suggest electro- and photoeffects, such as electric field and charge, can play an important role in enhancing surface reactions. These studies mostly rely on using density functional theory (DFT) to investigate surface reactions under these effects. However, integration of DFT with microkinetic modeling in plasma catalysis, which is crucial for establishing a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between the gas-phase chemistry and surface reactions, remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a first-principles framework coupling DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling to investigate the role of electric field on plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis. The DFT-microkinetic model shows more consistent predictions with experimental observations, as compared to the case wherein the variable effects of plasma process parameters on surface reactions are neglected. In particular, predictions of the DFT-microkinetic model indicate electric field can have a notable effect on surface reactions relative to other process parameters. A global sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate how ammonia synthesis pathways will change in relation to different plasma process parameters. The DFT-microkinetic model is then used in conjunction with active learning to systematically explore the complex parameter space of the plasma-catalytic ammonia synthesis to maximize the amount of produced ammonia while inhibiting reactions dissipating energy, such as the recombination of H2 through gas-phase H radicals and surface-adsorbed H. This paper demonstrates the importance of accounting for the effects of electric field on surface reactions when investigating and optimizing the performance of plasma-catalytic processes.

Abstract The metal-support interactions (MSI) could greatly determine the electronic properties of single-atom catalysts, thus affecting the catalytic performance. However, the typical approach to regulating MSI usually suffers from interference of the variation of supports or sacrificing the stability of catalysts. Here, we effectively regulate the site-specific MSI of Ir single atoms anchored on Ni layered double hydroxide through an electrochemical deposition strategy. Cathodic deposition drives Ir atoms to locate at three-fold facial center cubic hollow sites with strong MSI, while anodic deposition drives Ir atoms to deposit onto oxygen vacancy sites with weak MSI. The mass activity and intrinsic activity of Ir single-atom catalysts with strong MSI towards oxygen evolution reaction are 19.5 and 5.2 times that with weak MSI, respectively. Mechanism study reveals that the strong MSI between Ir atoms and the support stimulates the activity of Ir sites by inducing the switch of active sites from Ni sites to Ir sites and optimizes the adsorption strength of intermediates, thereby enhancing the activity.

Earth-abundant manganese-based oxides have emerged as promising alternatives to noble-metal-based catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic conditions; however, their inferior activity and stability present critical challenges for the sustainable production of hydrogen via water electrolysis. Moving beyond oxides, heteroanionic materials, which incorporate anions with lower electronegativity than oxygen, have shown potential for improving the OER performance, but a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms is lacking. Here, we investigate manganese-based oxychlorides (Mn8O10Cl3 and FeMn7O10Cl3) that exhibit excellent activity and stability for acidic OER to elucidate material property dynamics and correlate them with OER behaviors. Our rigorous electrochemical stability testing reveals that the high operating potential mitigates Mn dissolution over prolonged exposure to the OER conditions. Through a combination of ex situ and in situ surface and bulk-sensitive X-ray spectroscopy analyses, we observe a trade-off between increasing Mn valence and maintaining structural integrity, which results in dynamic bond length changes within the [MnCl6] octahedra during the activation and degradation processes of these oxychloride catalysts. This study provides insights into the fundamental relationships between the chemical, electronic, and geometric properties of the catalysts and their electrocatalytic outcomes.

Calculating the thermal conductivity of heterostructures with multiple layers presents a significant challenge for state-of-the-art ab initio methods. In this study we introduce an efficient neural-network force field (NNFF) to explore the thermal transport characteristics of van der Waals heterostructures based on PtSTe, using both the phonon Boltzmann transport equation and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Besides demonstrating a remarkable level of agreement with both theoretical and experimental data, our predictions reveal that heterogeneous combinations like $\mathrm{PtSTe}\text{\ensuremath{-}}{\mathrm{PtTe}}_{2}$ display a notable reduction in thermal conductivity at room temperature, primarily due to broken out-of-plane symmetries and the presence of weak van der Waals interactions. Furthermore, our study highlights the superiority of MD simulations with NNFFs in capturing higher-order anharmonic phonon properties. This is demonstrated through the analysis of the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity curves of PtSTe-based van der Waals heterostructures and advances our understanding of phonon transport in those materials.

Abstract Metalloborophene, characterized by the presence of metal‐centered boron wheels denoted as M©B n , has garnered considerable attention in recent years due to its versatile properties and potential applications in fields such as electronics, spintronics, and catalysis. However, the experimental verification of metalloborophene is challenging, mainly due to the unconventional 2D boron networks. In this study, scanning tunneling microscopy, X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy, low energy electron diffraction, and first‐principles calculations are employed to unveil Cu©B 8 metalloborophene nanoribbons formed via spontaneous alloying after the deposition of boron on a heated Cu(110) substrate under ultrahigh vacuum condition. The thermodynamically preferred precursor, the anchoring of boron network to metal atoms, and anisotropic lattice mismatch are identified as pivotal factors in the formation of these metalloborophene nanoribbons. This discovery expands the repertoire of 2D materials and offers a potential pathway for the synthesis of other metalloborophenes.

The revolutionary development of machine learning (ML), data science, and analytics, coupled with its application in material science, stands as a significant milestone of the scientific community over the last decade. Investigating active, stable, and cost-efficient catalysts is crucial for oxygen evolution reaction owing to the significance in a range of electrochemical energy conversion processes. In this work, we have demonstrated an efficient approach of high-throughput screening to find stable transition metal oxides under acid condition for high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts through density functional theory (DFT) calculation and a machine learning algorithm. A methodology utilizing both the Materials Project database and DFT calculations was introduced to assess the acid stability under specific reaction conditions. Building upon this, OER catalytic activity of acid-stable materials was examined, highlighting potential OER catalysts that meet the required properties. We identified IrO2, Fe(SbO3)2, Co(SbO3)2, Ni(SbO3)2, FeSbO4, Fe(SbO3)4, MoWO6, TiSnO4, CoSbO4, and Ti(WO4)2 as promising catalysts, several of which have already been experimentally discovered for their robust OER performance, while others are novel for experimental exploration, thereby broadening the chemical scope for efficient OER electrocatalysts. Descriptors of the bond length of TM–O and the first ionization energy were used to unveil the OER activity origin. From the calculated results, guidance has been derived to effectively execute advanced high-throughput screenings for the discovery of catalysts with favorable properties. Furthermore, the intrinsic correlation between catalytic performance and various atomic and structural factors was elucidated using the ML algorithm. Through these approaches, we not only streamline the choice of the promising electrocatalysts but also offer insights for the design of varied catalyst models and the discovery of superior catalysts.

Catalytic hydrogenation of nitrobenzene (Ph-NO2) to aniline (Ph-NH2) is a model reaction in the field of catalysis, in which the development of efficient catalysts remains a great challenge due to the lack of strategies to solve activity and selectivity problems. In this work, the mechanism of Ph-NO2 hydrogenation over Pt1 supported on phosphomolybdic acid (α-PMA) was proposed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results show that the dissociation of the first and second N-O bonds is triggered by single H-induced and double H-induced mechanisms, respectively. The limiting potential of the reaction process is -0.19 V, which is the smallest potential in the field of Ph-NO2 reduction reaction to date. In the whole reaction process, the catalytic active site is the Pt atom, and polyoxometalate plays the role of an electronic sponge in the reaction. Additionally, based on experimentally confirmed Pt1/Na3PMA, the reduction capacity of Pd1/Na3PMA toward Ph-NO2 was predicted by DFT calculation. The distinctive adsorption patterns of Ph-NO2 on Pt1/Na3PMA and Pd1/Na3PMA were elucidated using the DOS diagram and fragment molecular orbital analysis. We anticipate that our theoretical calculations can provide novel perspectives for experimental researchers.

Understanding the role of hydrogen bond networks in determining the relaxation dynamics is essential for understanding natural phenomena in liquid water. Classical pairwise additive models have been widely utilized for elaborating the underlying mechanism behind the relaxation phenomena. However, they have shown their limits due to either the absence or inaccurate descriptions of many-body and medium-to-long-range interactions. This work demonstrates that the Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics (DPMD) model trained with SCAN functional help calculate the dielectric constant at the accuracy of the first-principles simulations. The DPMD model outperforms the classical force fields (SPC/Fw and TIP4P/ε) in predicting dielectric spectra especially in replicating high-frequency excesses, attributed to its adeptness in simulating intricate hydrogen bond networks. Through a comprehensive analysis of the simulation results, it becomes evident that only the DPMD model effectively accommodates a wide range of hydrogen bond coordination scenarios thereby characterizing the intricate nature of the hydrogen bond network. This adaptability stems from the intricate interplay of many-body interactions and intramolecular dynamics. In addition, orientation defects within the DPMD model play a significant role in shaping the potential energy barrier due to the adaptability.

Isolating Pd atoms has been shown to be crucial for the design of a Pd-based electrocatalyst toward 2e– oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, there are limited studies focusing on the systematic compositional design that leads to an optimal balance between activity and selectivity. Herein, we design a series of Au@Pd core@shell structures to investigate the influence of the Pd 4d orbital overlapping degree on 2e– ORR performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that enhanced H2O2 selectivity and activity are achieved at Pdn clusters with n ≤ 3, and Pd clusters larger than Pd3 should be active for 4e– ORR. However, experimental results show that Au@Pd nanowires (NWs) with Pd4 as the primary structure exhibit the optimal H2O2 performance in an acidic electrolyte with a high mass activity (7.05 A mg–1 at 0.4 V) and H2O2 selectivity (nearly 95%). Thus, we report that Pd4, instead of Pd3, is the upper threshold of Pd cluster size for an ideal 2e– ORR. It results from the oxygen coverage on the catalyst surface during the ORR process, and such an oxygen coverage phenomenon causes electron redistribution and weakened *OOH binding strength on active sites, leading to enhanced activity of Pd4 with only 0.06 V overpotential in acidic media.

Abstract The advancement of economical and readily available electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) holds paramount importance in the advancement of fuel cells and metal‐air batteries. Recently, 2D non‐metallic materials have obtained substantial attention as viable alternatives for ORR catalysts due to their manifold advantages, encompassing low cost, ample availability, substantial surface‐to‐volume ratio, high conductivity, exceptional durability, and competitive activity. The augmented ORR performances observed in metal‐free 2D materials typically arise from heteroatom doping, defects, or the formation of heterostructures. Here, the authors delve into the realm of electrocatalysts for the ORR, pivoting around metal‐free 2D materials. Initially, the merits of metal‐free 2D materials are explored and the reaction mechanism of the ORR is dissected. Subsequently, a comprehensive survey of diverse metal‐free 2D materials is presented, tracing their evolutionary journey from fundamental concepts to pragmatic applications in the context of ORR. Substantial importance is given on the exploration of various strategies for enhancing metal‐free 2D materials and assessing their impact on inherent material performance, including electronic properties. Finally, the challenges and future prospects that lie ahead for metal‐free 2D materials are underscored, as they aspire to serve as efficient ORR electrocatalysts.

The interplay between covalent and noncovalent interactions at the solid–liquid interface strongly influences electrocatalytic reactions. Although methods to determine the former interactions have been rigorously developed, the latter are often described with static bilayer models or similarly approximate methods. In this study, we account for the disorder and dynamics at complex electrochemical interfaces by proposing a simple theory to estimate the enthalpy of solvation for adsorbed intermediates. In a strategy reminiscent of Born–Haber cycles, the enthalpy of solvation is expressed in terms of two subprocesses: vacancy creation by water reorganization and adsorbate interaction with solvent molecules. The magnitude of the solvation enthalpy is then determined as a mean valueof hydrated adsorbate-catalyst configurations obtained from simulated annealing with ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulations. This theory can be generalized for many combinations of surfaces and adsorbates. Its application improves treatment of energetics at electrified solid–liquid interfaces as well as corresponding structure–activity–stability predictions, as demonstrated for electrochemical oxygen reduction on Pt(111) and on Fe–N–C catalysts and for ethanol electrooxidation on Pt(111).

We present a methodology leveraging machine learning models to generate interatomic potentials for crystalline materials. This approach is rooted in the material’s crystallography in question. Specifically, we tap into the occupied Wyckoff sites, extracting the defining features that encapsulate the atomic local order in the material. Our choice for the target variable is the formation energy per atom, derived from the total energy of the structure’s representative cell. Our machine learning model’s architecture depends on the occupied Wyckoff sites. The diversity of these occupied sites conditions the layering scheme within the model. Atoms occupying a particular Wyckoff site were modeled with the architecture and learning parameters linked to the respective layer. To illustrate our method, we developed an interatomic potential for atomic interactions in α-alumina. For training purposes, we generated the samples through quantum mechanical computations. The evaluation of the learned interatomic potential involved conducting molecular dynamics calculations on a 2 × 2 × 2 supercell, yielding formation energies per atom deviating by less than 1.0 meV from the quantum mechanics results. The methodology described here paves the way for further innovations, potentially ushering in the creation of interatomic potentials that can be utilized for more than one material. Moreover, this approach provides valuable insights into the feasibility of substituting atoms within a compound by focusing exclusively on the specific Wyckoff sites that they occupy.

Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key half-reaction in fields including water electrolysis, organic synthesis, and water treatment. With the development of the industry, research into highly active and stable oxygen evolution anodes in an acidic environment is essential. DSA is the dimensionally stable anode. Widespread attention has been paid to titanium-based DSAs in the field of acidic oxygen precipitation due to their low overpotential and high acid resistance. The titanium-based anode mainly consists of two parts: catalyst and titanium substrate, where the design of the catalyst is the key to the anode design. The factors affecting the catalytic activity and durability of the titanium-based DSA were heterogeneous and rarely reported. In this paper, the influence of catalytic mechanism and composition design on the catalytic activity and service life of anode is reviewed from the perspective of the catalyst. Then, the current situation related to anode preparation is summarized, and an improvement strategy to enhance the activity and stability of anode is proposed based on the failure mode of titanium-based DSA.

Rapid and accurate performance acquisition of high-temperature gas turbine blades is fundamental to energy system design, analysis, and evaluation. Data-driven surrogate models are a popular alternative to complex and expensive numerical methods, but they require numerous labeled data and are often inaccurate when influenced by multi-source random factors. In this paper, a data-driven framework is proposed based on neural networks and active learning. Gas turbine blade performance with multi-source random factors can be quickly and accurately predicted. Two active learning-based sampling strategies, the Bayesian Sampling strategy (BS) and the Combined Sampling strategy (CS), are proposed to improve the efficiency of dataset building. The established prediction model is called active learning-based neural network (ALNN), which significantly improves the prediction accuracy with small samples. Compared with the artificial neural network using traditional Latin hypercube sampling, the prediction accuracy for the maximum stress of the blade is improved by 31.9%, and the prediction accuracy for the maximum deformation is improved by 47.6%. In addition, based on the ALNN, the low cycle fatigue probabilistic life of the gas turbine blade with multi-source random factors is evaluated. When the material and processing parameters and operating condition parameters are varied randomly, the minimum value of the low cycle fatigue life is 7000 cycles.

The focus of this chapter is on the breakdown of ammonia intending to produce hydrogen as the cleanest source of energy. A review of microreactors and related technical literature is first collected. Then, the chemical mechanism of two coupled reactions (combustion and decomposition) are discussed. These two reactions are essentially underway in the same coupled microchannels. An autothermal plug-flow reactor for NH3 decomposition is a type of chemical reactor that utilizes a catalytic process to convert ammonia (NH3) into nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2). This reaction is important in the production of hydrogen for fuel cells, as well as in the removal of ammonia from industrial waste streams. The autothermal plug-flow reactor is particularly useful for this reaction because it allows for both exothermic and endothermic reactions to occur simultaneously, without the need for external heating or cooling. The reactor design includes an annular region on the outside of a microchannel containing the catalyst, which allows for efficient heat transfer and mass transfer. The main effective parameters for this type of reactor include temperature, pressure, flow rate, catalyst type and loading, reactant concentration, reactor geometry, and inlet temperature and composition. By optimizing these parameters, the efficiency, selectivity, and yield of the NH3 decomposition reaction can be improved.

Electrowinning-coupled competitive separation (ECCS) CO2 capture technology, utilizing renewable electricity as the energy input, is regarded as a promising electrochemically mediated CO2 capture approach to substitute for the traditional solvent-based CO2 scrubbing method. However, this technology is still distant from practical application due to its energy-intensive property, sensitivity to oxygen, amine degradation, and system complexity. The selection of a suitable solvent plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall performance and scalability of the ECCS system. To address an efficient solvent screening method, this paper proposed a systematic comparison of solvents in terms of thermodynamics, electrochemistry, absorption, and desorption performance. The proposed solvent screening method undergoes a critical evaluation through the development of a thermodynamic model and experimentation. Using MEA, EDA, and NH3 as examples (solvents extensively discussed in the ECCS system), the paper provides a comprehensive discussion of the solvent screening method. Results indicate that EDA exhibits superior CO2 absorption and thermodynamic performance. NH3 solvent demonstrates better CO2 desorption and electrochemical performance. However, there is an antithetical relationship between the thermodynamic and electrochemical performance. This phenomenon arises because the Cu2+–solvent complex, characterized by a stronger coupling performance, is more stable, necessitating a higher potential to reduce the Cu2+–solvent complex. This leads to increased energy consumption during the solvent regeneration process. Therefore, when solvent screening is conducted, it is essential to categorize and thoroughly consider thermodynamics, electrochemistry, and absorption and desorption performance.

Ba-rich compositions in the BaxSr1-xMnO3 (BSMO) cubic perovskite (3C) system are magnetic ferroelectrics and are of interest for their strong magnetoelectric coupling. Beyond x = 0.5, they only form in hexagonal polymorphs. Here, the 3C phase boundary is pushed to Ba0.6Sr0.4MnO3 for the thin films. Using regular pulsed laser deposition (rPLD), 3C Ba0.6Sr0.4MnO3 could be epitaxially stabilized on DyScO3 (101)o substrates by using a 0.1% O2/99.9% N2 gas mixture. However, the 3C phase was mixed with the 4H polymorph for films 24 nm thick and above, and the films were relatively rough. To improve flatness and phase purity, changes in growth kinetics were investigated and interval PLD (iPLD) was especially effective. In iPLD, deposition is interrupted after completion of approximately one monolayer, and the deposit is annealed for a specific period of time before repeating. Both film flatness and, more importantly, the volume of the 3C polymorph improved with iPLD, resulting in 40 nm single-phase films. The results imply that iPLD improves the persistent nucleation of highly metastable phases and offers a new approach to epitaxial stabilization of novel materials, including more Ba-rich BSMO compositions in the 3C structure.

Alkaline water electrolysis is a sustainable way to produce green hydrogen using renewable electricity. Even though the rates of the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are 2-3 orders of magnitude less under alkaline conditions than under acidic conditions, the possibility of using non-precious metal catalysts makes alkaline HER appealing. We identify a novel and facile route for substantially improving HER performance via the use of commercially available NiTi shape memory alloys, which upon heating undergo a phase transformation from the monoclinic martensite to the cubic austenite structure. While the room-temperature performance is modest, austenitic NiTi outperforms Pt (which is the state-of-the-art HER electrocatalyst) in terms of current density by ≤50% at 80 °C. Surface ensembles presented by the austenite phase are computed with density functional theory to bind hydrogen more weakly than either metallic Ni or Ti and to have binding energies ideally suited for HER.
