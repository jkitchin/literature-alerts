      <title>Interfacial Spontaneous Reduction Strategy to Synthesize Low-Valent Pt Single-Atom Catalyst for Boosting Hydrosilylation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c03541</link>
      <description>Chan Yang, Jinmeng Tong, Hailong Li, Huiying Gao, Guodong Wen, Jinsong Zhang, Yukun Yan, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391338350

                A heterogeneous N-coordinated Pt single-atom catalyst with low valence was synthesized via an &#8220;interfacial spontaneous reduction (ISR)&#8221; strategy under mild conditions, using cheap and widely available industrial raw materials. The reducing groups were modified onto commercial carbon black XC-72R, which was able to reduce the Pt species at the solid&#8211;liquid interface without the need of an extra reducing agent, followed by in situ coordination of the reduced Pt atoms, preventing their aggregation. The prepared Pt single-atom catalyst (Pt1&#8211;N&#8211;C) acted as an actual reactive center for hydrosilylation and catalyzed the reaction directly, resulting in the absence of an induction period and an ultrahigh turnover frequency of 9.3 &#215; 106 h&#8211;1. Moreover, the catalysts can be used on a wide range of olefin and silane substrates, achieving a turnover number of over 4.5 &#215; 106 in the subkilogram-scale reaction. The ISR strategy provides a low-cost method to prepare noble metal single atoms on industrial-grade materials with the potential for large-scale preparation and application.</description>

      <title>Insights into the Confinement Effect of NiMo Catalysts toward Alkaline Hydrogen Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c06058</link>
      <description>Fulin Yang, Shouci Lu, Y. Feng, Luhong Fu, Ligang Feng, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391348864

                Replacing platinum-group metals by Ni-based catalysts for the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is highly desired for anion-exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), while huge challenges still exist due to the sluggish kinetics and oxidative deactivation of the Ni active centers. Herein, we report an ingenious design of the microstructured Ni-based electrocatalysts featured by nanoparticulate NiMo alloy cores encapsulated by N-doped carbon layer shells (NiMo-5%@NC) to address these problems. Electrochemical experiments and theoretical calculations confirm that the confinement effect can rationally weaken the binding energy to oxygenated species through direct interactions with the carbon layers rather than relying on the traditionally regulated electronic structures of NiMo surfaces. This ultimately reduces the energy barrier for water formation, the potential-determining step for the alkaline HOR undergoing the bifunctional path. Moreover, the incorporation of carbon layers not only enhances the passivation resistance of Ni-based surfaces but also alleviates the oxidative dissolution of the alloyed Mo-species, resulting in obviously improved stability. As a result, NiMo-5%@NC exhibits significantly improved HOR activity and stability compared to the counterpart without the protection of the shells (NiMo-5%). This work shows comprehensive insights into the confinement effect exerted by carbon layer shells, providing a different light on the guidelines to deal with the sluggish kinetics and oxidative deactivation of the Ni active centers for AEMFCs.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Density Functional and Kinetic Monte Carlo Study of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Hydrogenation on a Well-Defined Ni/CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Model Catalyst: Role of Eley&#8211;Rideal Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05336</link>
      <description>Pablo Lozano-Reis, Pablo Gamallo, R. Say&#243;s, Francesc Illas, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391361162

                A detailed multiscale study of the mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation on a well-defined Ni/CeO2 model catalyst is reported that couples periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations with kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. The study includes an analysis of the role of Eley&#8211;Rideal elementary steps for the water formation step, which are usually neglected on the overall picture of the mechanism, catalytic activity, and selectivity. The DFT calculations for the chosen model consisting of a Ni4 cluster supported on CeO2 (111) show large enough adsorption energies along with low energy barriers that suggest this catalyst to be a good option for high selective CO2 methanation. The kMC simulations results show a synergic effect between the two 3-fold hollow sites of the supported Ni4 cluster with some elementary reactions dominant in one site, while other reactions prefer the another, nearly equivalent site. This effect is even more evident for the simulations explicitly including Eley&#8211;Rideal steps. The kMC simulations reveal that CO is formed via the dissociative pathway of the reverse water&#8211;gas shift reaction, while methane is formed via a CO2 &#8594; CO &#8594; HCO &#8594; CH &#8594; CH2 &#8594; CH3 &#8594; CH4 mechanism. Overall, our results show the importance of including the Eley&#8211;Rideal reactions and point to small Ni clusters supported on the CeO2 (111) surface as potential good catalysts for high selective CO2 methanation under mild conditions, while very active and selective toward CO formation at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Lowering the Coordination of Octahedra in Spinel Oxides by the Robust Fe&#8211;N Bonds for Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05344</link>
      <description>Yantao Wang, Jinzhi Jia, Xiaohua Zhao, Wenhui Hu, Hua Li, Xiaowan Bai, Junfeng Huang, Jinhua Zhang, Jian Li, Xiaohai Tang, Yong Peng, Jier Huang, Cailing Xu, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391362025

                The coordination environment of octahedra in spinel oxides plays a vital role in regulating the OER performance. But selectively engineering the octahedral units is very challenging for the design of low-cost and high-efficient electrocatalysts. In this work, the low Fe coordinated CoFe2O4 (CoFe2O4&#8211;Cd) is successfully obtained by taking advantage of the different bond strength between metal centers and N atoms in 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane-decorated CoFe-MOF-74 (CoFe-MOF-74/TCNQ) and shows promising physical and chemical properties. DFT calculations reveal that the low-coordinated Fe improves the electrochemical symmetry of catalysts and reduces the free energy barrier of the potential-determining step, resulting in the high activity and stability of CoFe2O4&#8211;Cd. Systematic experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that TCNQ motivates the more electron-occupied states at the Fermi level of CoFe-MOF-74 and enhances the hybridization of Co 3d, Fe 3d, and N 2p, leading to the formation of the Co/Fe&#8211;N bond. Owing to the stronger Fe&#8211;N bonds, CoFe-MOF-74/TCNQ realizes the step-by-step phase transformation upon electrochemical activation, achieving the CoFe2O4&#8211;Cd. This work advances the current comprehension of the controllable regulation of coordination environment of octahedra in spinel oxides, which in turn contributes to the design of high-performance electrocatalysts for OER.</description>

      <title>Nitrogenation and Oxygenation of an Unstrained C&#8211;C Bond Enabled by the Merger of Visible-Light and Cu-Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05701</link>
      <description>Yu Wang, Huan Meng, Sifan Li, Wei Shu, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391379480

                Unstrained carbon&#8211;carbon bonds are among the most prevalent and inert chemical bonds. Thus, developing synthetic transformations directly from unstrained carbon&#8211;carbon bonds under mild conditions is ideal yet challenging due to the inertness and steric hindrance. Here, a visible-light and copper-catalyzed azidation and etherification of a remote and unstrained C&#8211;C bond of amines via 1,4-aryl migration have been reported. This redox-neutral protocol shows exquisite site-selectivity, broad scope, and good functional group tolerance, directly transforming unstrained C&#8211;C bonds to C&#8211;N and C&#8211;O bonds at room temperature. Facile derivatizations of benzyl azide products into free amines, triazoles, and phosphamides highlight the potential utility of this method for target molecule synthesis and medicinal chemistry.</description>

      <title>Flavin-Mediated Photocatalysis Provides a General Platform for Sulfide C&#8211;H Functionalization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05785</link>

                Functionalized sulfides are important in many areas of science, ranging from chemical biology through drug discovery to organic materials chemistry. Sulfides bearing pendant reactive groups in the &#945;-position are particularly useful; however, methods for the selective valorization of simple sulfides or the late-stage functionalization of complex sulfides by the convenient addition of valuable functionality are underexplored. Here we exemplify a general reaction platform for sulfide functionalization by showcasing three modes of &#945;-sulfur C&#8211;H functionalization; cyanation, alkenylation, and alkynylation. Using inexpensive and commercially available riboflavin tetraacetate and visible light, decoration of both feedstock and complex sulfides proceeds in a good yield and with high selectivity. Methionine-containing peptides can also be selectively functionalized and a tolerance screen using amino-acid dopants suggests that the platform is compatible with most amino-acid side chains and thus is a potential tool for bioconjugation.</description>

      <title>Ni-Catalyzed Cyanation of (Hetero)aryl Halides with Acetonitrile as Cyano Source</title>

                We present a highly efficient method for cyanating challenging substrates with a specific focus on aryl fluorides. This innovative methodology has been successfully expanded to encompass a diverse array of aryl halides, underscoring its versatility and broad applicability. The nickel-catalyzed protocol utilizes acetonitrile under mild temperature conditions, providing a clean and safe alternative for cyanation. Notably, it employs a nonhazardous, nongaseous, metal-free cyanide source and demonstrates a wide substrate scope, accommodating aryl chlorides, fluorides, bromides, and iodides. The reaction is particularly effective with acetonitrile. This catalytic cyanation process serves as a valuable route for synthesizing pharmaceuticals such as letrozole, citalopram, and other NNRTI drugs. Mechanistically, we propose that a catalytic cycle involving zerovalent nickel and divalent nickel is more plausible for this reaction.</description>

                Successful development of catalysts for electrochemical formic acid oxidation (FAO) requires finding an optimal balance between catalytic performance (activity, stability, and selectivity) and catalyst cost. While platinum is one of the most active catalyst materials for FAO, it suffers from performance loss at low overpotentials due to poisoning with CO, which is one of the intermediates formed in the so-called indirect path of FAO. In this work, we explored the synergistic effects of the supporting material and annealing temperature on the performance of Pt thin films for FAO in acidic media. Compared to the as-prepared Pt films, the annealed films show up to 5-fold and 15-fold improvement for FAO on Pt@Ni and Pt@Cr, respectively. While the most active Pt@Ni thin film shows the lowest stability, the most active Pt@Cr thin film is also the most stable, challenging conventional trade-offs in electrocatalysis and providing a promising candidate for FAO nanocatalyst synthesis.</description>

      <title>Stereoblock vs Stereoblend: Orchestrating Competing Living Coordination Chain Transfer Polymerizations for the One-Pot Production of New Viscoelastic Grades of Poly(4-methyl-1-pentene)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05570</link>

                By exerting control over two populations of coexisting cyclopentadienyl, amidinate (CPAM) group 4 metal active species that possess different stereoselectivities for chain growth propagation during the living coordinative chain transfer polymerization (LCCTP) of 4-methyl-1-pentene, controlled production of grades for poly(4-methyl-1-pentene) (PMP) materials that display a tunable range of viscoelastic properties can be achieved in &#8220;one-pot&#8221; fashion. Analytical and spectroscopic investigations reveal that these differences in viscoelastic properties are associated with formation of atactic/isotactic PMP stereoblends, rather than a stereoblock chain architecture. These results serve to establish the ability of low molar mass atactic PMP to function as an effective property modifier for commercially important isotactic PMP, which in its pure form is highly brittle with low tensile strength. The further outcome of these studies is extension of multistate LCCTP as a tool for expanding the range of accessible grades and properties of polyolefins that can be produced from the limited small set of industrially significant olefins.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Role of Internal Donors in Shaping Heterogeneous Ziegler&#8211;Natta Catalysts Based on Nonempirical Structural Determination</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05480</link>

                The addition of internal donors (IDs) to the heterogeneous Ziegler&#8211;Natta catalyst for propylene polymerization is fundamental to obtain highly isotactic polypropylene, but its role in shaping the stereospecific structure of the catalyst is still not comprehended. In this work, we apply nonempirical structure determination, based on a genetic algorithm and density functional theory calculations, to ternary systems composing MgCl2, TiCl4, and ID. We found that the copresence of TiCl4 and ID led to the preferential formation of specific surface motifs, involving sharp edges and concavities. This was achieved by concerted adsorption of chelating ID and octahedral TiCl4 and significantly promoted TiCl4 situated in stereospecific environments. The multiplicity of adsorption modes of IDs was found to have a direct consequence on the structural diversity, where phthalate exhibited far greater diversity than 1,3-diether. In conclusion, this study revealed the essentiality of ID-driven reconstruction of MgCl2 in understanding the structure and function of this catalyst.</description>

      <title>Selective Catalytic Reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO by a Single-Site Heterobimetallic Iron&#8211;Potassium Complex Supported on Alumina</title>

                CO2 has attracted much attention as a C1 feedstock for synthetic fuels via its selective catalytic hydrogenation to liquid hydrocarbons. One strategy is the catalytic reduction of CO2 to CO through the reverse water&#8211;gas shift (RWGS) reaction, followed by the hydrogenation of CO. In this work, potassium tris(tert-butoxy)ferrate, [{(THF)2KFe(OtBu)3}2], was supported on alumina that had been partially dehydroxylated at 500 &#176;C (Al2O3&#8211;500), and the resulting catalyst was investigated in the selective reduction of CO2 to CO. The active site precursor was identified as [(THF)K(AlsO)Fe(OtBu)2(OHAl)] (i.e., [(THF)KFe(OtBu)2]/Al2O3&#8211;500), denoted 2-K, based on elemental analysis, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Under the reaction conditions, the precursor becomes an active, stable, and selective RWGS catalyst (100% selectivity to CO at 22.5% CO2 conversion). The reaction mechanism was studied by operando DRIFT spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) modeling. The results are consistent with a mechanism involving H2 activation by K[(AlsO)2FeOH], leading to K[(AlsO)2FeH]. CO2 insertion gives hydroxycarbonyl intermediate K[(AlsO)2FeCOOH], followed by liberation of CO to regenerate K[(AlsO)2FeOH].</description>

      <title>Overturning CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Hydrogenation Selectivity via Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05527</link>
      <description>Wenzhe Zhang, Hui Lin, Wei Yao, Xuan Zhou, Yunlei An, Yuanyuan Dai, Qiang Niu, Tiejun Lin, Liangshu Zhong, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391449336

                Strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) is commonly observed for platinum-group metals on reducible oxide supports upon a high-temperature reduction (&#8805;500 &#176;C). Herein, we show that the SMSI state can be constructed over a Ru/anatase-TiO2 catalyst using the CO2 hydrogenation reaction gas at a low temperature of &#8764;210 &#176;C, which could overturn the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity from 100% CH4 to &gt;99% CO. It is revealed that the exposed metallic Ru nanoparticles promote CH4 formation via formate intermediates at temperatures &lt;200 &#176;C. Elevating the temperature under a H2-containing atmosphere causes the evolution of active TiOx suboxide to form an encapsulated structure of Ru@TiOx, which changes the surface intermediate from formate to carboxy species during CO2 hydrogenation, thus leading to exclusive CO formation with long-term catalytic stability. The O2-containing gas treatment of encapsulated Ru@TiOx could achieve the cyclic switch of product selectivity between CO and CH4. This work provides an effective strategy to modulate the SMSI state at a very low temperature.</description>

                Copper-catalyzed radical transformations establish a powerful toolkit to construct versatile complex organic compounds. The copper-mediated bond formation step of radicals plays a critical role in controlling chemo- and stereoselectivity of copper-catalyzed radical transformation reactions. This bond formation step involves three possible pathways: ion-type bond formation, radical substitution, and reductive elimination. This review highlights the recent advances in theoretical studies on mechanisms and controlling models on the selectivity of Cu-mediated radical-involved bond formation, providing a general mechanistic comprehension of this key elementary step in copper catalysis.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Size Effect of Ceria Nanocube-Supported Platinum Nanoparticles in Complete Propane Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c06139</link>

                The elimination of propane is one of the key tasks in reducing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and automotive exhaust emissions. The platinum nanoparticle (NP) is a promising catalyst for propane oxidation, while the study of its structural characteristics and functionality remains in its infancy. In this work, we synthesized the nanocubes CeO2 with a well-defined (100) facet supporting Pt NPs with various sizes, from 1.3 to 7 nm, and systematically investigated the effect of the Pt size on complete propane oxidation efficiency. In particular, CeO2(100) supported Pt NPs smaller than 4 nm promote the formation of positively charged Pt sites, which hinder the adsorption and activation of propane and reduce the intrinsic activity for propane oxidation. Consequently, within this size range, the catalytic performance is primarily influenced by the electronic state of the Pt species, with metallic Pt being identified as the active site for the reaction. Conversely, as the particle size exceeds 4 nm, metallic Pt particles become dominant and the geometric structure starts to influence the activity as well. Such entanglement of electronic and geometric factors gives rise to a volcano relationship between reaction rates and Pt particle sizes ranging from 1.3 to 7 nm, while an increased correlation can be observed between the turnover frequencies and the particle sizes in this range. This knowledge can guide the synthesis of highly active catalysts, enabling the efficient oxidation of VOCs with reduced precious metal loadings.</description>

      <title>N-Heterocyclic Carbene-Carbodiimide (NHC-CDI) Betaines as Organocatalysts for &#946;-Butyrolactone Polymerization: Synthesis of Green PHB Plasticizers with Tailored Molecular Weights</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05357</link>

                The manufacture of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) stands out as a promising alternative to traditional plastics. This polymer is usually produced by bacteria-based biotechnology or metal-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of &#946;-butyrolactone (&#946;-BL). Nevertheless, commercial PHB suffers from different issues, from poor processability to high production costs. Herein, we report the chemical synthesis of PHB from the ROP of rac-&#946;-butyrolactone promoted by a zwitterionic organocatalyst, an N-heterocyclic carbene-carbodiimide (NHC-CDI) betaine adduct. This reaction has been investigated by a combination of experimental and computational methods. The catalyst cleaves the &#946;-BL via nucleophilic displacement of the C&#8211;O(carboxyl) bond followed by intramolecular elimination to give protonated betaine&#8211;crotonate ion pairs, the active polymerization initiators. Polymer growth is propagated and controlled by these betaine ion pairs, which render amorphous low-molecular-weight PHBs by an unusual mechanism with rapid chain transfer to the monomer regime, analogous to the well-known mechanism of ethylene oligomerization with late transition-metal catalysts. The resulting material is suitable as a biodegradable and biocompatible plasticizer for commercial bacterial or synthetic PHB. Perfect compatibility between the matrix and the additive and a significant reduction of the crystallinity resulted in a more flexible and resilient material.</description>

      <title>Insight into Selectivity Differences of Glycerol Electro-Oxidation on Pt(111) and Ag(111)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05551</link>
      <description>Zhongjie Meng, David Tran, Johan Hjelm, Henrik H. Kristoffersen, Jan Rossmeisl, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391484173

                Electro-oxidation is a way to utilize glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel production, to produce fuels and feedstock chemicals for the chemical industry. A significant challenge is to get products with high selectivity, so it is desirable to understand the glycerol oxidation mechanisms in further detail. Using density functional theory calculations, we investigated possible glycerol oxidation intermediates on Pt(111) and Ag(111). We find that the different adsorption preferences of the intermediates on Pt (adsorption via carbon atoms) and Ag (adsorption via oxygen atoms) lead to different preferred reaction pathways, resulting in different products. The reaction pathways on both surfaces involve glyceraldehyde as a key intermediate; however, upon further oxidation, Pt(111) preferentially produces glyceric acid (CH2OH&#8211;CHOH&#8211;COOH), while on Ag(111) C&#8211;C bonds are broken, which leads to the production of glycolaldehyde and formic acid (CH2OH&#8211;CHO and HCOOH). These predictions agree well with the experimental outcome of the electro-oxidation of glycerol on Pt and Ag surfaces. Our study therefore provides useful insights for optimizing the selectivity of glycerol oxidation and improving the utilization of glycerol.</description>

      <title>Metal&#8211;Support Interaction between Titanium Oxynitride and Pt Nanoparticles Enables Efficient Low-Pt-Loaded High-Performance Electrodes at Relevant Oxygen Reduction Reaction Current Densities</title>

                In the present work, we report on a synergistic relationship between platinum nanoparticles and a titanium oxynitride support (TiOxNy/C) in the context of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis. As demonstrated herein, this composite configuration results in significantly improved electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR relative to platinum dispersed on carbon support (Pt/C) at high overpotentials. Specifically, the ORR performance was assessed under an elevated mass transport regime using the modified floating electrode configuration, which enabled us to pursue the reaction closer to PEMFC-relevant current densities. A comprehensive investigation attributes the ORR performance increase to a strong interaction between platinum and the TiOxNy/C support. In particular, according to the generated strain maps obtained via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the Pt-TiOxNy/C analogue exhibits a more localized strain in Pt nanoparticles in comparison to that in the Pt/C sample. The altered Pt structure could explain the measured ORR activity trend via the d-band theory, which lowers the platinum surface coverage with ORR intermediates. In terms of the Pt particle size effect, our observation presents an anomaly as the Pt-TiOxNy/C analogue, despite having almost two times smaller nanoparticles (2.9 nm) compared to the Pt/C benchmark (4.8 nm), manifests higher specific activity. This provides a promising strategy to further lower the Pt loading and increase the ECSA without sacrificing the catalytic activity under fuel cell-relevant potentials. Apart from the ORR, the platinum-TiOxNy/C interaction is of a sufficient magnitude not to follow the typical particle size effect also in the context of other reactions such as CO stripping, hydrogen oxidation reaction, and water discharge. The trend for the latter is ascribed to the lower oxophilicity of Pt-based on electrochemical surface coverage analysis. Namely, a lower surface coverage with oxygenated species is found for the Pt-TiOxNy/C analogue. Further insights were provided by performing a detailed STEM characterization via the identical location mode (IL-STEM) in particular, via 4DSTEM acquisition. This disclosed that Pt particles are partially encapsulated within a thin layer of TiOxNy origin.</description>

      <title>Selective Hydrogenation of Alkyne by Atomically Precise Pd&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; Nanocluster Catalysts: Accurate Construction of the Coplanar and Specific Active Sites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05833</link>
      <description>Jie Tang, Kun Jia, Ruiqi Zhang, Chao Liu, Xinzhang Lin, Tingting Ge, Xiaorui Liu, Qiao Zhao, Wei Liu, Ding Ma, Hongjun Fan, Jiahui Huang, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391484269

                Atomically precise nanoclusters are promising model catalysts to understand the relationship between structure and catalytic activity. However, designing efficient active sites remains challenging because the highly covered ligands obscure the metal sites. Herein, we reported a Pd6(S-Adm)6(PPh3)(PPh) nanocluster, which shows high selectivity in the semihydrogenation of aromatic alkyne. The Pd6 nanocluster has a unique chair structure, where the pan is composed of the coplanar Pd atoms, the back is composed of two S-Adm ligands, and the legs are composed of four S-Adm, one PPh3, and one PPh ligands. Experiments reveal that the high selectivity of intact Pd6 nanocluster is attributed to the synergistic effect of thiols and phosphines, modulating the electron properties and benefiting the proper hydrogen dissociation ability and desorption of product. Interestingly, it was found that the exposed coplanar Pd atoms could provide specific active sites for the adsorption of C&#8801;C and benzene ring. DFT calculations show that phenylacetylene and styrene adsorb on the coplanar Pd6 much weaker than on the Pd(111) surface, allowing the styrene to be desorbed before further hydrogenation. The phenyl adsorption constrains that the hydrogenation can occur only on the coplanar Pd6, which is more facile for phenylacetylene than for styrene, and results in semihydrogenation.</description>
