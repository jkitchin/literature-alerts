                Various decarbonylation reactions via oxidative addition of carbonyl compounds to metal catalysts can be applied to late-stage modification and have been actively studied to date; however, several inherent problems derived from the oxidative addition are difficult to solve, such as toxic CO production, deactivation of catalysts by CO adsorption, intolerance of some functional groups, or air-sensitivity of catalysts. In this context, formal decarbonylation, which eliminates CO as other compounds without involving oxidative addition, is attractive but hardly reported, especially using heterogeneous catalysts. Herein, formal decarbonylation of diaryl 1,2-diketones to afford monoketones using CeO2 as a reusable heterogeneous catalyst and O2 in the air as the terminal oxidant was developed, generating CO2 as the only byproduct. The results revealed that the reaction was enabled by the synergistic catalytic effect of the Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs and redox properties in CeO2.</description>

      <title>Efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Production from Biomass-Based HCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H by Cooperation of Quantum Dots Photocatalysts with Weak HCHO Adsorption and In Situ Generated Ni&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;</title>

                Efficient hydrogen (H2) production from renewable resources, such as biomass, one of the largest renewable resources on the earth, instead of fossil resources, is highly desirable. Making it via HCO2H as an intermediate for H2 production from biomass both facilitates efficient H2 production and can avoid the issues of H2 storage. Herein, we report efficient H2 production from raw biomass-based formic acid (HCO2H) by a noble-metal-free catalysis system under mild conditions, enabled by cooperation of CdS/ZnS-S2&#8211; quantum dots photocatalysts with weak formaldehyde (HCHO) adsorption and in situ generated Ni0, resulting in H2 with a 94% yield in 3.5 h, with a 99.7% selectivity and a 537 &#177; 14 mol mg&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 average rate at 50 &#176;C under visible-light irradiation. This study should promote the exploration of catalytic systems for streamlined H2 production from renewable biomass for practical application.</description>

      <title>Amino Acid Synthesis through C&#8211;N Coupling between &#945;-Ketoacids and Hydroxylamine from Nitrate Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01793</link>
      <description>Yiyang Zhou, Ruizhi Duan, Qinge Huang, Chunmei Ding, Can Li, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399896383

                The artificial synthesis of amino acids is an important yet challenging subject. Electrocatalytic C&#8211;N coupling from organic acids and nitrogen sources provides an opportunity for this target but with the difficulty of C&#8211;N bond formation toward the production of amino acids. Herein, we report the synthesis of amino acids (alanine, glutamic acid, glycine, leucine, valine) from nitrate and &#945;-ketoacids with a hybrid catalyst, cobalt phthalocyanine immobilized on carbon nanotubes (CoPc/CNT). The Faradaic efficiency for alanine production with CoPc/CNT is as high as 61%. The CoPc catalyst integrated with CNTs can catalyze nitrate reduction to hydroxylamine, which is switched from a thermodynamically uphill to a downhill process. The hydroxylamine intermediate attacks the &#945;-carbon of an &#945;-ketoacid to form an oxime. Amino acids are produced by the reduction of oximes catalyzed by CNTs. The bifunctionality of CoPc/CNT steers the tandem catalytic reaction toward the efficient production of amino acids in one pot. This work identifies that enhancing the reduction of nitrate to hydroxylamine is the key to C&#8211;N bond formation in amino acid synthesis.</description>

      <title>Synergizing Amino Tethering and Carbon Shell Confinement Enables Confinement Synthesis of PtCo Intermetallic Catalysts for Highly Durable Fuel Cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01202</link>
      <description>Kechuang Wan, Chuanqi Luo, Jue Wang, Haitao Chen, Jingjing Zhang, Bing Li, Maorong Chai, Pingwen Ming, Cunman Zhang, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399896671

                Intermetallic compounds possess superior catalytic performance over their disordered alloy counterparts, while their synthesis usually requires high-temperature treatment, which causes the sintering of catalysts. This work demonstrates the high-temperature confinement synthesis (HTCS) of PtCo intermetallic compounds for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) by integrating ultrathin nitrogen-doped carbon shell (NCS) confined PtCo alloy into &#8722;NH2 functionalized black pearls 2000 carbon architectures (PtCo@NCS/BP-NH2). Benefiting from amino tethering and carbon shell confinement, high-temperature sintering behavior is effectively inhibited. PtCo@NCS/BP-NH2 possesses outstanding ORR performance, and the assembled single cell exhibits a small peak power density loss rate of 4% after the accelerated durability test (ADT), outperforming PtCo/BP (12.5%) and commercial Pt/C (18.9%). Theoretical calculations along with experiments reveal that PtCo and NCS synergically optimize the electronic structure, weaken the Pt&#8211;O dipole effect, and lower the reaction barrier for ORR. The study provides insight into the HTCS of catalysts and unveils intrinsic electronic interaction for ORR.</description>

      <title>Structure and Reactivity of Active Oxygen Species on Silver Surfaces for Ethylene Epoxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01566</link>
      <description>Minjie Guo, Nanchen Dongfang, Marcella Iannuzzi, Jeroen A. van Bokhoven, Luca Artiglia, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399908109

                The epoxidation of ethylene stands as one of the most important industrial catalytic reactions, and silver-based catalysts show superior activity and selectivity. Oxygen is activated on the surface of silver during the reaction and exerts a substantial impact on product selectivity. Notably, the oxygen species residing in the topmost atomic layers profoundly influence the reactivity of a catalyst. However, their characterization under in situ reaction conditions remains a huge challenge, and specific structures have not been identified yet. In this study, we employ in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations to determine the oxygen species formed at the topmost atomic layers of a silver foil and to assign them a structure. Three different groups of oxygen species activated on silver are identified: (i) surface lattice oxygen and two oxygen species originating from associatively adsorbed dioxygen and (ii) top and (iii) subsurface oxygen. Transient in situ photoelectron spectroscopy experiments are carried out to reveal the dynamic evolution and thus reactivity of the different oxygen species under ethylene epoxidation reaction environments. The top oxygen atom from the adsorbed associated dioxygen is the most active. Meanwhile, a frequency-selective data analysis method, developed to process time-resolved data, provides insights into the evolving trends of peak intensities for different oxygen species. The versatility of this method suggests its potential application in future time-resolved characterization studies.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Oxygen Vacancy-Promoted Synthesis of Aminoarenes from Nitroarenes Using Waste H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S as a &#8220;Hydrogen Donor&#8221;</title>

                The conversion of H2S to high-value-added products is appealing for alleviating environmental pollution and realizing resource utilization. Herein, we report the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline using waste H2S as a "hydrogen donor" over the catalyst of FeCeO2&#8722;&#948; with abundant oxygen vacancies (Ov), especially an asymmetric oxygen vacancy (ASOv). The electron-rich nature of the ASOv sites facilitates electron transfer to the electron-deficient nitro group, promoting the adsorption and activation of Ph&#8211;NO2 through the elongation and cleavage of the N&#8211;O bond. Benefiting from the formation of abundant ASOv sites, the resulting FeCeO2&#8722;&#948; achieves an impressive 85.6% Ph&#8211;NO2 conversion and 81.9% Ph&#8211;NH2 selectivity at 1.5 MPa and 90 &#176;C, which surpasses that of pure CeO2 with flower and rod morphologies. In situ FT-IR measurements combined with density functional theory calculations have elucidated a plausible reaction mechanism and a rate-limiting step in the hydrogenation of Ph&#8211;NO2 by H2S.</description>

      <title>Photochemical Tuning of Tricoordinated Nitrogen Deficiency in Carbon Nitride to Create Delocalized &#960; Electron Clouds for Efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Photoreduction</title>

                Precisely engineering point defects holds promise for the development of state-of-the-art photocatalysts for CO2 conversion. This study demonstrates the controllable creation of nitrogen vacancies (VNs) in the centers of heptazine rings of graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) via a photochemical-assisted nitrogen etching strategy. Spectroscopic analyses and theoretical simulations elucidate the photochemical process to hydrogenate the nitrogen situated at the center of the g-C3N4 heptazine ring and then release an ammonia molecule, accompanied by the photooxidation of the sacrificial agents. The catalyst with an optimal VNs concentration achieves a CO generation rate of 35.2 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 with nearly 100% selectivity, comparable to the performance of the reported g-C3N4 materials. The remarkably improved photoactivity is due to the adjustments of the electronic structures and the midgap states of g-C3N4 by the delocalized &#960; electron cloud created in the 12-membered ring surrounding the VN, which maximizes the light-harvesting efficiencies and suppresses the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. The VNs also activates the neighboring catalytic carbon centers to reduce the energy barrier for CO2 reduction. This work provides a good design concept to regulate catalytic activity by engineering point defects.</description>

                Controlling the precise placement of active metals on supports is highly desirable yet challenging, which governs both the reaction pathway and the ultimate outcomes of catalytic reactions. Herein, the Cu species are positioned to the Lewis acidic sites created by the ultrahigh-temperature calcination of TiO2, where the atomic structures of the Lewis acids are identified as five-coordinated Ti4+ cations bound to three-coordinated O2&#8211; anions (L&#946; sites) by in situ characterizations. Owing to the robust chemical affinity, CuOx manifests itself as a nanopatch. The Cu/TiO2 catalyst without any modifications exhibits a propylene oxide (PO) formation rate of 44 mmol gCu&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 for direct epoxidation of propylene using molecular oxygen (DEP). The PO yield on Cu/TiO2 can be efficiently correlated with the quantity of the decreased Lewis acids, which demonstrates that the intimated interaction between the Cu species and Lewis acids should be responsible for PO production. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations suggest that Cu+ in the Ti&#8211;O&#8211;Cu interface formed at the L&#946; sites is the active site of the DEP reaction, with the aid of the adjacent Cu atom. This study provides a Cu-based catalyst for the DEP reaction.</description>

      <title>Selective Hydrogenation of Quinizarins to Leuco-quinizarins and Their Direct Derivatization Using Flow-Batch-Separator Unified Reactors under Continuous-Flow Conditions</title>

                Anthraquinone derivatives are classes of compounds employed in the production of valuable materials. Leuco-quinizarin, the 2-electron-reduced form of quinizarin (1,4-dihydroxy-anthraquinone), is a highly active and useful reactant for the synthesis of variety of anthraquinone derivatives. However, conventional methods of leuco-quinizarin synthesis require stoichiometric amounts of inorganic reductants and acids or bases. We developed Pt/DMPSi-Al2O3 and Pt-Ni/DMPSi-Al2O3 as highly active and selective heterogeneous catalysts for the hydrogenation of quinizarins to leuco-quinizarins under neutral and continuous-flow conditions. Remarkably, bimetallic effects of Ni and Pt nanoparticle systems were highlighted in the selective hydrogenation of the substituted quinizarin. In addition, the continuous-flow synthesis of leuco-quinizarin and its derivatization reaction were integrated to be a fully continuous process using flow-batch-separator unified reactors.</description>

      <title>Mass-Transfer Enhancement in the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane over GaN Supported on Zeolite Nanosheets with a Short &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;-Axis and Hierarchical Pores</title>

                The CO2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2&#8211;ODHP) is a highly important reaction for not only producing large amounts of propylene but also consuming the CO2 resource. GaN/zeolite catalysts deliver preferable activity in the reaction. However, similar to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts, there are shortcomings such as poor stability and coke accumulation, especially when operated at temperatures higher than 550 &#176;C. Generally, carbon deposition is one of the main reasons for catalyst deactivation. The limited mass transfer greatly aggravates the deposited carbon formation, since carbon precursors could not be removed in time. In the present work, we modified zeolites with a short b-axis and hierarchical pores, which could offer a shorter diffusion distance and pore-rich structure to enhance the mass transfer. Thanks to this enhancement, the catalyst offers an initial propane conversion of 68.0% with a yield of 39.4% to propylene, surpassing other reported GaN/zeolite catalysts to data. Importantly, the catalyst showed a low loss rate of activity and a low amount of deposited carbon, which was easily regenerated compared with those of other catalysts without a short b-axis or hierarchical pores. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) confirmed that the reaction involves a coupling reaction of direct dehydrogenation and CO2 reduction via reverse water&#8211;gas shift reaction, and CO2 participates in the reaction. The present work sheds light on designing an efficient catalyst for CO2&#8211;ODHP via a mass transfer-boosted strategy and, importantly, is expected to provide inspiration in constructing a zeolite with a short b-axis and hierarchical pores.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Key Loop: Enhancing &lt;scp&gt;l&lt;/scp&gt;-Threonine Transaldolase&#8217;s Catalytic Potential</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c02049</link>
      <description>Zhiwen Xi, Jingxin Rao, Xinyi Zhang, Zhiyong Liu, Mingyue Zheng, Lihong Li, Wenchi Zhang, Yan Xu, Rongzhen Zhang, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400030623

                l-Threonine transaldolase (LTTA) is an attractive biocatalyst because of its potential diastereoselectivity in the synthesis of &#946;-hydroxy-&#945;-amino acids (&#946;HAAs). However, prospective development of LTTA has been hampered by its low activity. Here, a combination of techniques involving structural comparison, computational analysis, Loop deletion, and alanine scanning was used to identify a key Loop region (Loop 1) regulating the catalytic ability of Chitiniphilus shinanonensis LTTA (CsLTTA). Saturation mutagenesis and iterative saturation mutagenesis at the hot spots in Loop 1 were performed, and the best variant containing an F70T/C57Q/Y69T (TQT) triple mutation was screened. The diastereoisomer excess (de) produced by the TQT variant (95.4%syn) was greater than that produced by the wild-type (WT) enzyme (75.2%syn), and the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of the TQT variant was four times higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. Molecular dynamics simulations, metadynamics simulations, and CAVER analysis revealed the critical role of the Loop 1 structure in regulating the hydrogen bond network and thus reshaping the active-site pocket to control the syn-tunnel direction. Further engineering of Loop 1 in ObiH, an LTTA responsible for obafluorin biosynthesis, resulted in the development of the F70T-C57Q-H69T (ObiH-TQT) variant producing a de of 97%syn. Using the ObiH-TQT variant for kilogram-scale synthesis of l-syn-p-methylsulfonylphenylserine, coupled with acetaldehyde elimination, resulted in space&#8211;time yields of up to 12.7 g L&#8211;1 h&#8211;1. The method achieved 98.3% substrate conversion and 99.2%syn de within 6 h, marking the highest reported levels to date. The above findings will contribute to the industrial production of &#946;-hydroxy-&#945;-amino acids, offer insights into the mechanism of Loop regions regulating the catalytic function of LTTAs, and provide ideas for engineering other enzymes.</description>

      <title>Synergetic Ni&#8211;Ce Active Sites in Mixed Cerium/Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nodes for Selective Methane Oxidation into Ethanol</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c02883</link>
      <description>Wahida Begum, Manav Chauhan, Manav Chauhan, Priyanka Gupta, Naved Akhtar, Neha Antil, Rajashree Newar, Kuntal Manna, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400040958

                The direct oxidation of methane into ethanol with high productivity under mild conditions is a grand challenge. We report the development of mixed cerium/zirconium metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nodes-supported mononuclear nickel(II)-hydroxyl species [Cex/Zry&#8211;UiO&#8211;Ni(OH)] as efficient heterogeneous catalysts for direct transformation of methane into ethanol. The Ni2+ ion in Cex/Zry&#8211;UiO&#8211;Ni(OH) MOFs coordinates with a &#956;4&#8211;O&#8211;, one hydroxy group, and two neutral carboxylate oxygens, which are directly bonded to the Ce4+ ion at the mixed metal-oxo nodes. The spectroscopic and control experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the precise composition of the mixed-metal node, the isolation of mono Ni-hydroxyl species at the node, and the cooperative Ni&#8211;Ce active sites confined within the porous UiO-MOFs promote the facile C&#8211;H activation of methane at 80 &#176;C, leading to the formation of &#8226;CH3 radicals and subsequent C&#8211;C coupling within the pores to produce ethanol in an extraordinarily high yield of 6521 mmol gNi&#8211;1 with &gt;93% selectivity, outperforming most of the current reports. Our mechanistic investigation suggests that the direct methane oxidation into ethanol proceeds via a dual catalytic cycle, in which the doping of Ce4+ ion within MOF's node and the proximity between Ce4+ and Ni2+ ions lead to the reversible Ce&#8211;Ocarboxylate bond dissociation and Ni&#8211;(&#956;2&#8211;OH)&#8211;Ce bond formation, which is the key for efficient formation of &#8226;CH3 radical in the turnover limiting step. This work highlights the importance of mixed metal-MOFs in designing well-defined heterobimetallic-supported catalysts for the valorization of methane and light alkanes via cooperative catalysis.</description>
