      <title>Implementing the Blowers&#8211;Masel Approximation to Scale Activation Energy Based on Reaction Enthalpy in Mean-Field Microkinetic Modeling for Catalytic Methane Partial Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05436</link>

                Mean-field microkinetic modeling is a powerful tool for catalyst design and the simulation of catalytic processes. The reaction enthalpies in a microkinetic model often need to be adjusted when changing species' binding energies to model different catalysts, when performing thermodynamic sensitivity analyses, and when fitting experimental data. When altering reaction enthalpies, the activation energies should also be reasonably altered to ensure realistic reaction rates. The Blowers&#8211;Masel approximation (BMA) relates the reaction barrier to the reaction enthalpy. Unlike the Br&#248;nsted&#8211;Evans&#8211;Polani relationship, the BMA requires less data because only one parameter, the intrinsic activation energy, needs to be determined. We validate this application of BMA relations to model surface reactions by comparing against density functional theory data taken from the literature. By incorporating the BMA rate description into the open-source Cantera software, we enable a new workflow, demonstrated herein, allowing rapid screening of catalysts using linear scaling relationships and BMA kinetics within the process simulation software. For demonstration purposes, a catalyst screening for catalytic methane partial oxidation on 81 hypothetical metals is conducted. We compared the results with and without BMA-corrected rates. The heat maps of various descriptors (e.g., CH4 conversion, syngas yield) show that using BMA rates instead of Arrhenius rates (with constant activation energies) changes which metals are most active. Heat maps of sensitivity analyses can help identify which reactions or species are the most influential in shaping the descriptor map patterns. Our findings indicate that while using BMA-adjusted rates did not markedly affect the most sensitive reactions, it did change the most influential species.</description>

      <title>Enhanced PtIn Catalyst via Ce-Assisted Confinement Effect in Propane Dehydrogenation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c02517</link>
      <description>Peng Wang, Huafei Liao, Yang Chen, Xin Tao, Yuyan Gan, Huihui Deng, Yajie Fu, Yu Tang, Lizhi Wu, Li Tan, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396779672

                The PtIn nanoalloys with high surface energy are generally in a metastable state during harsh reaction conditions, and the ordered alloy structure is not conducive to exposure of surface Pt active sites. Herein, a strategy for restructuring the unfavorable PtIn alloy structure via heteroatom (Ce) doping is applied to advance an isolated Pt&#948;+ confined by the InCeOx nanoislands supported on SiO2. The as-synthesized catalyst with optimizing PtIn(Ce) ternary components exhibits &#8764;92.2% selectivity toward propylene and a stable propane conversion of &#8764;67.1% at 550 &#176;C (kd of 0.010 h&#8211;1). As demonstrated by the comprehensive characterizations, the introduced proper amount of Ce species leads to the reorganization of the disadvantaged PtIn nanoalloy structure into the robustness of the isolated Pt&#948;+ site confined by the InCeOx nanoislands via inhibiting the In0 species generation. The introduced Ce species modulate the electronic interaction between Pt, In, and carrier, stimulating the capability to activate reactive molecules and at the same time acting as spatial physical barriers to restrict the migration of the isolated Pt&#948;+ species. This work proposed a facile and efficient strategy to promote the capability against sintering and coking of the Pt-based catalyst in propane dehydrogenation.</description>

      <title>Effect of a Physisorbed Tetrabutylammonium Cation Film on Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction on Pt Single-Crystal Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01765</link>
      <description>Julia Fern&#225;ndez&#8208;Vidal, Marc T. M. Koper, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396780694

                The addition of tetrabutylammonium (TBA+) to alkaline electrolytes enhances the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity on Pt single-crystal electrodes. The concentration of TBA+ significantly influences the HER on Pt(111). Concentrations of &#8804;1 mM yield no significant effect on HER currents or the coverage of adsorbed hydrogen (H*) but exhibit an interaction with the OHads on the surface. Conversely, concentrations of &gt;1 mM result in an apparent site-blocking effect for underpotential-deposited H* caused by the physisorption of the organic cation, which counterintuitively leads to an increase in the HER activity. The physisorption of TBA+ is linked to its accumulation in the diffuse layer, as it can be reversibly removed by the addition of nonadsorbing cations such as sodium. Following the previous literature on the TBA+ interaction with electrode surfaces, we ascribe this effect to the formation of a two-dimensional TBA+ film in the double layer. On stepped Pt single-crystal surfaces, TBA+ enhances HER activity at all concentrations, primarily at step sites. Our findings not only highlight the complexities of TBA+ accumulation on Pt electrodes but also offer important molecular-level insights for optimizing the HER by organic film formation on various atomic-level electrode structures.</description>

      <title>Single-Site-Level Deciphering of the Complexity of Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction on Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01640</link>
      <description>Geunsu Bae, Han Chang Kwon, Man Ho Han, Hyung&#8208;Suk Oh, Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Jaouen, Chang Hyuck Choi, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396789824

                Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts are emerging as potential alternatives to platinum in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for fuel cell cathodes. The challenge in optimizing these catalysts lies in their structural complexity and the multiplicity of reaction pathways. Here, we employ a series of model catalysts with varying amounts of Fe&#8211;Nx and Fe nanoparticles (NPs) and estimate their turnover frequency (TOF) for apparent H2O and H2O2 production at different catalyst loadings. This approach highlights the importance of the surface site density (SD) of Fe&#8211;Nx moieties in determining the overall ORR activity, selectivity, and even stability. We uncover that increasing the SD of Fe&#8211;Nx moieties fosters the indirect 4e&#8211; ORR pathway and consequently promotes their TOF toward preferential H2O production. In contrast, Fe NPs, often formed at high Fe contents, behave as anticatalysts (or spectators) in this context. Indeed, an online inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) study reveals that a higher SD can lead to the faster leaching of Fe&#8211;Nx moieties during operation, resulting in accelerated activity decline. Taken together, the comprehensive understanding of the intricate dependence of catalytic activity and stability on the nature and amount of Fe species provides a basis for design principles of next-generation Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts.</description>

      <title>Deactivation and Reductive Regeneration of Sn-Beta for Liquid-Phase Biomass Conversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01976</link>
      <description>Juan S. Mart&#237;nez-Esp&#237;n, S&#248;ren Tolborg, Bai Yang, Nicolai Krog Andersen, Anna Katerinopoulou, Lars P. Hansen, Ulla Gro Nielsen, Esben Taarning, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396830886

                Catalyst stability and deactivation remain significant hurdles, which hinder the realization of many promising chemical processes. This applies especially for biomass conversion over zeolitic materials, where the commonly applied solvothermal conditions adversely affect the stability of the catalysts. For example, tin-doped zeolite Beta, Sn-Beta, is one of the materials often used for a wide range of biomass reactions in the liquid phase. Herein, we present insights into the deactivation of Sn-Beta catalysts and assess different regeneration procedures. We identify tin and silicon leaching, along with tin restructuring into tin(IV) oxide, SnO2, as the primary deactivation mechanisms during the conversion of biobased-derived glycolaldehyde in methanol/water solvents. Concurrently, the spent catalysts have a range of mesopores over a highly ordered and poorly defective zeolitic framework. Furthermore, we highlight the critical impact of reaction medium compositions affecting the leaching of tin and silicon and provide levers to mitigate it (e.g., higher alcohols, low water concentrations). Through the implementation of an oxidation&#8211;reduction&#8211;oxidation regeneration procedure, the catalyst contains twice as high active site concentrations as the use of conventional thermal oxidation. The oxidation&#8211;reduction&#8211;oxidation procedure reverses some of the ongoing deactivation (tin restructuring into SnO2) with the transformation of the otherwise inactive SnO2 into active sites. Together, the generated understanding of Sn-Beta deactivation and the successful application of a superior regeneration method can bring this family of catalysts closer to industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Molybdenum/ZSM-5 Catalyzes Methane Co-Aromatization with Furan: Unveiling the Mechanism with Solid-State NMR</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01827</link>
      <description>Wei Gao, Guodong Qi, Chao Wang, Qiang Wang, Jiawei Liang, Jun Xu, Feng Deng, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396835087

                The co-aromatization of methane and organic compounds using metal-modified zeolite catalysts represents a promising approach for the direct conversion of natural gas into valuable aromatics. In this work, we employ solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to systematically examine the reaction mechanism and evaluate the impact of co-feeding furan on methane aromatization over Mo/ZSM-5 zeolite. The results reveal a dual role of furan in promoting methane to aromatics and stabilizing the Mo/ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst in the co-aromatization. It is found that co-feeding a moderate amount of furan enhances methane conversion and boosts the selectivity to benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX). The 12C/13C isotope switching experiments coupled with 1H and 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy reveal that furan actively participates in the methane aromatization reaction by forming an olefin pool, which promotes methane activation and contributes to the following aromatics formation. Two-dimensional 1H&#8211;95Mo heteronuclear correlation NMR spectroscopy indicates that furan facilitates the activation of Mo oxides into MoOxCy species, which serve as the active sites for methane aromatization. The co-feeding furan also helps to enhance catalyst stability by limiting the agglomeration of Mo and the deposition of coking species.</description>

                Acidic CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) shows advantages in high carbon utilization efficiency yet encounters great challenges in suppressing undesired hydrogen evolution competition and increasing C2+ product selectivity. Although it is known that Cu0/Cu+ interfaces are conducive to C&#8211;C coupling processes, the oxidation state of copper cannot be well maintained under the strong reductive condition and large current electrolysis operation. Herein, we propose an I2 addition involved strategy to protect the oxidation state of Cu and promote dynamic Cu0/Cu+ interfaces during acidic CO2RR. With the addition of I2 in the electrolyte, a high C2+ product Faraday efficiency of above 70% can be achieved at 0.4&#8211;0.6 A cm&#8211;2 even under a low K+ concentration of 0.3 M, which is comparable to those reported performances with almost ten times higher K+ concentrations (2&#8211;3 M). This low K+ concentration in electrolytes significantly avoids salt crystallization in the CO2 transport channel to enhance the electrolyzer's stability. As proved by the surface Pourbaix diagram and experimental results, adding excessive I2 into the electrolyte boosts the generation of CuI; also, CuI and metallic Cu coexist under electrochemical reduction conditions, demonstrating that a redox loop of Cu &#8594; CuI &#8594; Cu exists. The loop holds the key to constructing the dynamic Cu0/Cu+ interface, which is tightly bound to the adsorption of the *CO reaction intermediate and further promotes the C&#8211;C coupling process.</description>
