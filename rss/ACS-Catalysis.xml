      <title>Generation of Sulfamoyl Radical for the Modular Synthesis of Sulfonamides</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01560</link>

                Efficient synthesis of sulfonamides has long been pursued by chemists due to their frequent occurrence in pharmaceuticals, especially in anti-inflammatory medicines. The traditional assembly from sulfonyl chlorides and amines, as well as the recently developed one-step synthesis of sulfonamides involving sulfur dioxide, still faces challenges such as poor substrate compatibility and/or stringent reaction conditions. Herein, we present a strategy for the in situ generation of sulfamoyl radicals for the one-step modular synthesis of both alkenyl and alkyl sulfonamides with wide substrate applicability (&gt;100 examples), mild reaction conditions, and easily accessible starting materials. This method is successfully applied to the late-stage modification of drug molecules (23 examples), the one-step synthesis of the drug molecule naratriptan, and the 15N-labeling of sulfonamides.</description>

      <title>Stable Operation of Paired CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction/Glycerol Oxidation at High Current Density</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05952</link>
      <description>Attila Korm&#225;nyos, Adrienn Szirmai, Bal&#225;zs Endr&#337;di, Csaba Jan&#225;ky, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394786891

                Despite the considerable efforts made by the community, the high operation cell voltage of CO2 electrolyzers is still to be decreased to move toward commercialization. This is mostly due to the high energy need of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the most often used anodic pair for CO2 reduction. In this study, OER was replaced by the electrocatalytic oxidation of glycerol using carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles as an anode catalyst. In parallel, the reduction of CO2 to CO was performed at the Ag cathode catalyst using a membraneless microfluidic flow electrolyzer cell. Several parameters were optimized, starting from the catalyst layer composition (ionomer quality and quantity), through operating conditions (glycerol concentration, applied electrolyte flow rate, etc.), to the applied electrochemical protocol. By identifying the optimal conditions, a 75&#8211;85% Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward glycerol oxidation products (oxalate, glycerate, tartronate, lactate, glycolate, and formate) was achieved at 200 mA cm&#8211;2 total current density while the cathodic CO formation proceeded with close to 100% FE. With static protocols (potentio- or galvanostatic), a rapid loss of glycerol oxidation activity was observed during the long-term measurements. The anode catalyst was reactivated by applying a dynamic potential step protocol. This allowed the periodic reduction, hence, refreshing of Pt, ensuring stable, continuous operation for 5 h.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Peroxide as an Ideal Electron Donor for Long-Lasting Fenton Chemistry: Strong Enhancement of Fe(III) Activity by Heteroatom-Doped Nanocarbons</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00048</link>
      <description>Yiming Sun, Peng Zhou, Minglu Sun, Yuchen Zhang, Xiao Wang, Chenying Zhou, Yang Liu, Chuan-Shu He, Bo Lai, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394797401

                Heteroatom doping has been demonstrated to be an effective strategy to improve the catalytic activity of carbon materials. Herein, heteroatom-doped nanocarbons were found to be environmental protection cocatalysts for promoting Fenton oxidation. Nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) exhibited better catalytic activity than sulfur-, boron-, and phosphorus-doped rGO for enhancing Fenton oxidation. Unlike classical electron sacrificial agents, H2O2 was employed as an electron donor to enhance Fenton oxidation during the catalysis of N-rGO. Electrochemical analysis and nitrogen molecular model tests indicated the oxidation potential of Fe(III) increased with improvement in the N atom content (R2 = 0.97), revealing that the Fe atoms of FeOH2+ on the N-rGO surface are more likely to abstract electrons from H2O2. In addition, the delocalized &#960; electron is one of the active sites in N-rGO-boosted Fenton oxidation, and N-rGO could facilitate electron transfer from H2O2 to Fe(III) along the C&#8211;C/C&#9552;C structures due to the improvement of the conductivity ability and the oxidation potential of Fe(III). Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the pyrrole N species of N-rGO is the best catalytic activity site, resulting from the pyrrole N species with higher adsorption energy stretching the Fe&#8211;O bond of FeOH2+ to increase the activity of Fe(III) species. Therefore, the study findings provide insight into designing stable and efficient metal-free catalysts to enhance Fe(III) reactivity in overcoming the inherent drawbacks of the Fenton system.</description>

      <title>Structural and Functional Analysis of Heparosan Synthase 2 from &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella multocida&lt;/i&gt; to Improve the Synthesis of Heparin</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00677</link>
      <description>Eduardo Stancanelli, J.M. Krahn, Elizabeth Viverette, Robert Dutcher, Vijayakanth Pagadala, Mario J. Borgnia, Jian Liu, Lars C. Pedersen, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394800995

                Heparin is a widely used drug to treat thrombotic disorders in hospitals. Heparosan synthase 2 from Pasteurella multocida (PmHS2) is a key enzyme used for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of heparin oligosaccharides. It has both activities: glucosaminyl transferase activity and glucuronyl transferase activity; however, the mechanism to carry out the glyco-oligomerization is unknown. Here, we report crystal structures of PmHS2 constructs with bound uridine diphosphate (UDP) and a cryo-EM structure of PmHS2 in complex with UDP and a heptasaccharide (NS 7-mer) substrate. Using a liquid chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry analytical method, we discovered that the enzyme displays both a two-step concerted oligomerization mode and a distributive oligomerization mode depending on the nonreducing end of the starting oligosaccharide primer. Removal of seven amino acid residues from the C-terminus results in an enzymatically active monomer instead of a dimer and loses the concerted oligomerization mode of activity. In addition, the monomer construct can transfer N-acetyl glucosamine at a substrate concentration that is &#8764;7-fold higher than a wildtype enzyme. It was also determined that an F529A mutant can transfer an N-sulfoglucosamine (GlcNS) saccharide from a previously inactive UDP-GlcNS donor. Performing the glyco-transfer reaction at a high substrate concentration and the capability of using unnatural donors are desirable to simplifying the chemoenzymatic synthesis to prepare heparin-based therapeutics.</description>

      <title>Catalytic Dinitrogen Reduction to Silylamines by Molybdenum Nitride Complexes Bearing a Diphenolate N-Heterocyclic Carbene Ligand</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00307</link>
      <description>Zhaoxin Li, Chenrui Liu, Jing An, Xi Wu, Shaowei Hu, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394804794

                Despite substantial strides in the catalytic silylation of N2 employing phosphine-ligated transition metal complexes, further development has been impeded by the low reaction yields (based on reducing or silylating reagents). Here we present a series of Mo(VI) nitride complexes featuring a robust tridentate diphenolate N-heterocyclic carbene (OCO) ligand that serves as efficient catalysts for the reduction of N2 to silylamines, producing 57.3 equiv of tris(trimethylsilyl)amine with a yield of as high as 86%. Reductive silylation of Mo nitride complexes resulted in the isolation of a molybdenum silylimide intermediate. Our findings showed that the enhanced efficiency of the system could be ascribed to the high activity of catalysts and the suppression of side reactions, indicating that the OCO ligand plays a crucial role in stabilizing the Mo center across in high- and low-oxidation states in catalysis.</description>

                Palladium-catalyzed C&#8211;H annulation reactions represent a compelling strategy to construct complex ring systems with high step economy. While there are many approaches to annulate structures by activation of a single C&#8211;H bond, transformations that proceed by activation of multiple C&#8211;H bonds are less explored. This is especially true for examples where one of the reacting C&#8211;H bonds is located at an sp3 center. However, exciting developments in palladium-catalyzed C&#8211;H activation continue to expand the scope of these transformations and provide innovative strategies to construct challenging carbon&#8211;carbon bonds. From these discoveries, sequential C&#8211;H activations have emerged as a powerful tool to access complex ring systems through the activation of C(sp2)&#8211;H/C(sp3)&#8211;H or C(sp3)&#8211;H/C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds. In this Perspective, we showcase recent examples that use this strategy in order to highlight the synthetic potential of C&#8211;H activation-enabled annulations and inspire future use of these disconnections for diverse scaffold synthesis.</description>

      <title>Site-Selective Bimetallic Heterogeneous Nanostructures for Plasmon-Enhanced Photocatalysis of Nitrobenzene Hydrogenation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00024</link>

                Nitrobenzene hydrogenation, a critical pathway for synthesizing aniline, typically requires a high temperature and pressurized hydrogen for effective and selective reduction. It is of great significance to find a catalyst with a favorable reaction rate toward the selective hydrogenation of nitroaromatics. Herein, anisotropic Au&#8211;Pd tipped NPs were specially synthesized and found to exhibit efficient plasmon-enhanced hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline. Under light, Au&#8211;Pd tipped NPs exhibited a TOF of 166 h&#8211;1 with high selectivity (&gt;92%). Simulation results demonstrated that site-selective bimetallic heterogeneous nanostructures maintain a strong electromagnetic field, which further promotes the generation and transfer of energetic hot electrons for photocatalysis. Meanwhile, in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and quasi-in situ electron paramagnetic resonance revealed that the movement of hot electrons facilitates the enhanced participation of hot holes in the oxidation of the hydrogen donor. Our findings underscore that the rational design of bimetallic structures not only exposes rich active sites for incoming reactants but also prolongs the lifetime of hot carriers for efficient transfer and injection.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen, Sulfur Co-doped Hollow Carbon-Encapsulated Cu/Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P for Selective Oxidation Esterification of Furfurals</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01035</link>

                With the remarkable capability of encapsulating multifunctional active sites inside, carbon-based materials play vital roles in multifarious chemical transformations such as hydrogenation reactions, oxidation reactions, esterification reactions, etc. Herein, we propose an efficient and facile approach to construct a Cu/Co2P@C-NS catalyst, which consists of nitrogen&#8211;sulfur co-doped carbon (C-NS) encapsulated cobalt phosphide (Co2P) and copper double active sites. This approach focuses on the design and preparation of core&#8211;shell materials, that is, the ZIF-67 core is coated with an adhesive poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4&#8242;-sulfonyldiphenol) (PZS) polymer shell. The ZIF-67 core possesses a highly porous structure, coexistence of carbon and nitrogen elements, and uniform dispersion of Co species, making it an ideal template. The heteroatomic PZS polymer with decent coating ability makes it a promising coating material for creating core&#8211;shell structures. Additionally, nitrogen species in the PZS polymer could coordinate with Cu2+ to introduce extra Cu sites into the system. The Cu/Co2P@C-NS catalyst prepared from the pyrolysis of the precursor redistributes the surface charge of Co2P by additionally incorporating Cu, which effectively enhances substrate adsorption. As a result, the Cu/Co2P@C-NS catalyst demonstrates good catalytic performance in the oxidative esterification of furfuryl aldehydes. This study presents a reliable and straightforward method for preparing a non-noble-metal catalyst that exhibits high efficiency and activity in the one-pot oxidation and esterification of furfurals to methyl furoates.</description>

      <title>Arginine Kinase Activates Arginine for Phosphorylation by Pyramidalization and Polarization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00380</link>
      <description>Fabio Falcioni, Robert W. Molt, Yi Jin, Jonathan P. Waltho, Sam Hay, Nigel G. J. Richards, G. Michael Blackburn, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394834991

                Arginine phosphorylation plays numerous roles throughout biology. Arginine kinase (AK) catalyzes the delivery of an anionic phosphoryl group (PO3&#8211;) from ATP to a planar, trigonal nitrogen in a guanidinium cation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations have yielded a model of the transition state (TS) for the AK-catalyzed reaction. They reveal a network of over 50 hydrogen bonds that delivers unprecedented pyramidalization and out-of-plane polarization of the arginine guanidinium nitrogen (N&#951;2) and aligns the electron density on N&#951;2 with the scissile P&#8211;O bond, leading to in-line phosphoryl transfer via an associative mechanism. In the reverse reaction, the hydrogen-bonding network enforces the conformational distortion of a bound phosphoarginine substrate to increase the basicity of N&#951;2. This enables N&#951;2 protonation, which triggers PO3&#8211; migration to generate ATP. This polarization&#8211;pyramidalization of nitrogen in the arginine side chain is likely a general phenomenon that is exploited by many classes of enzymes mediating the post-translational modification of arginine.</description>

      <title>Construction of Diazo Compounds via Catalytic [3 + 2] Annulation of Vinyldiazoacetates and Their Synthetic Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01291</link>
      <description>Ming Bao, Diana Victoria Navarrete Carriola, Daniel J. Wherritt, Michael P. Doyle, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394835029

                Highly selective formal [3 + 2]-cycloaddition of vinyldiazoacetates with quinone ketals and quinoneimine ketals has been accomplished at room temperature with catalytic amounts of the Br&#248;nsted acid triflimide, leading to highly functionalized diazoacetates in good yields. The vinyldiazonium ion generated by electrophilic addition to the vinylogous position of the reactant vinyldiazo compound is the key intermediate in this selective transformation. Both oximidovinyldiazoacetates and those with other vinyl substituents undergo cycloaddition reactions with quinone ketals whose products, after extended reaction times, undergo substrate-dependent 1,2-migration; catalysis by Rh2(OAc)4, HNTf2, and Sc(OTf)3 effects these 1,2-migrations to the same products. However, the products from HNTf2-catalyzed reactions between quinoneimine and oximidovinyldiazoacetates undergo Rh2(OAc)4-catalyzed 1,3-C&#8211;H insertion. 1,3-Difunctionalization products are obtained for electrophilic reactions of Eschenmoser's salt with selected vinyldiazoacetates, but with &#945;-dibenzylaminomethyl ether, 1,6-hydride transfer reactions are observed with oximidovinyldiazoacetates.</description>

      <title>Steric Effects on the Oxygen Reduction Reaction with Cobalt Porphyrin Atropisomers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01295</link>

                The steric effects on the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have been rarely studied because O2 is small in size and ORR catalysts with the only difference in steric hindrance are difficult to be designed and synthesized. Herein, we report on homogeneous ORR catalyzed by four Co porphyrin atropisomers in tetrahydrofuran with decamethylferrocene and HClO4 at 298 K. All four atropisomers are active and selective for the 2H+/2e&#8211; ORR with an activity order &#945;&#945;&#945;&#945; &gt; &#945;&#945;&#945;&#946; &gt; &#945;&#945;&#946;&#946; &gt; &#945;&#946;&#945;&#946;. Kinetic studies revealed that the four atropisomers have the same ORR mechanism with proton-coupled O2 binding as the rate-determining step.</description>

                Halide perovskite nanocrystals have recently emerged as high-performance light-harvesting materials. They are also extensively studied for the fabrication of both light-emitting and photovoltaic devices. In comparison, their implementation as photocatalysts to trigger different organic reactions is limited. To add more diversity in catalysis, herein, different shapes and heterostructures of CsPbBr3 perovskite polyhedral nanocrystals are explored for visible-light-mediated room temperature photocatalytic Csp3&#8211;H bond-activated alkylation of cyclic ether using feedstock &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated acids as the keto-alkyl source. It started with the decarboxylative coupling of cinnamic acid at the &#945;-position of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and extended to several derivatives. The facets of nanocrystals matter, and hence, differently shaped nanocrystals showed variable rates of catalytic activities. With density functional theory calculation, the surface-adsorption-induced charge carrier transfer mechanism to facilitate such reactions is established. Different semiconductors and noble metal heterostructures that quenched the emission are also compared, and their inactiveness in catalysis was also correlated to the proposed mechanism. Combining all these observations, the roles of light, catalytic surfaces, oxygen, the nature of hosts, and coupling with other material heterostructures are analyzed in detail and reported. Such reactions with Csp3&#8211;H bond activation can lead to complex chemical scaffolds, unveiling an underexplored domain of heterogeneous photocatalytic organic reactions for Csp3&#8211;Csp3 cross-coupling.</description>

      <title>Enantioselective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers through Chiral Phosphoric Acid-Catalyzed Desymmetric Acylation with Azlactones</title>

      <description>Jiawei Xu, Wei Lin, Hanliang Zheng, Xin Li, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394836288

                C&#8211;O axially chiral diaryl ethers play important roles in natural products and bioactive molecules, but because of the low rotational barrier and strict steric hindrance requirements, the catalytic asymmetric construction of axially chiral diaryl ethers still remains a challenge. Herein, we devised a strategy employing achiral azlactone for the desymmetrization of prochiral diamines under the catalysis of chiral phosphoric acid. The targeted C&#8211;O axially chiral diaryl ethers were obtained in very good yields (up to 98%) and high enantioselectivities (up to &gt;99.5:0.5 er). The synthetic utility was demonstrated through large-scale reaction and transformations of the products. Moreover, DFT calculations were conducted to probe the origins of enantioselectivity.</description>

                This study unravels the catalytic effects of adjacent protons in redox catalysis of bifunctional Keggin-type phosphomolybdic acid clusters (H3PMo12O40). Isolated redox sites (O*) and Br&#248;nsted acid-redox site pairs (OH/O*) catalyze methanol oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), a redox reaction, via the identical elementary steps and the formation of the kinetically relevant [HOCH2&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O*]&#8225; and [OH&#183;&#183;&#183;HOCH2&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O*]&#8225; transition states, but with different kinetic requirements, established from selective site inactivation, product tracking, dynamic pyridine/2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine titrations, and kinetic assessments. The presence of adjacent protons interacts with and stabilizes the methanol precursor in the OH&#183;&#183;&#183;HOCH2&#8211;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O* adsorbed state through additional H-bonding interactions by 57 kJ mol&#8211;1 in adsorption enthalpy and by 144 J mol&#8211;1 K&#8211;1 in adsorption entropy. These additional interactions, stabilizing the [OH&#183;&#183;&#183;HOCH2&#183;&#183;&#183;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O*]&#8225; transition state, lead to a decrease in apparent methanol activation enthalpy of 50 kJ mol&#8211;1 and in activation entropy of 97 J mol&#8211;1 K&#8211;1, resulting in an overall increase in methanol ODH turnovers. The kinetic consequences of protons established here enable the rationalization of the redox reactivity on bifunctional POM clusters and display a nontraditional confinement effect to stabilize transition state energies.</description>

      <title>Photocatalytic Regeneration of Reactive Cofactors with InP Quantum Dots for the Continuous Chemical Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00817</link>

                The shuttling of redox-active nicotinamide cofactors between the light and dark cycles is the key to the continuous production of biomass in photosynthesis. The replication of such processes in artificial photosynthetic systems demands fast photoregeneration as well as simultaneous integration of these nicotinamide cofactors into the dark cycle. Here, we report the design of an artificial photosynthetic system for the continuous production of butanol via the constant photoregeneration and consumption of nicotinamide cofactors, powered by an indium phosphide quantum dot (InP QD) photocatalyst and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzyme, respectively. A strong electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged InP QDs and electron mediators significantly enhanced the charge extraction and utilization processes, enabling a fast (&#8764;30 min, with a turn over frequency of &#8764;1333 h&#8211;1), quantitative (&gt;99%), and selective photoregeneration of enzymatically active nicotinamide cofactors in the light cycle. These photoregenerated nicotinamide cofactors were further coupled in the dark cycle to trigger the ADH oxidoreductase enzyme for the production of butanol, via sequential as well as simultaneous light&#8211;dark cycles. The amount of butanol produced under simultaneous light&#8211;dark cycles was higher than the stoichiometric limit, proving the constant regeneration and consumption of nicotinamide cofactors in light and dark cycles, respectively. Thus, a proper design and integration of the InP QD-based photocatalytic cycle with the enzymatic cycle led to the effective electron shuttling between light and dark cycles, as seen in photosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Organoboron/Palladium Cocatalyzed Dehydrative Couplings of Azoles with Allylic Alcohols: A Combined Experimental and Computational Mechanistic Investigation</title>

                In the presence of Pd(Xantphos) and an electron-deficient arylboronic acid cocatalyst, azoles such as pyrazoles, triazoles, tetrazoles, and purines undergo regioselective, dehydrative allylations with allylic alcohols. The boronic acid has a significant effect on both the rate and the regioselectivity of these reactions. Herein, a combined experimental and computational mechanistic study of the synergistic organoboron- and palladium-catalyzed allylation of azoles is described. Kinetic analysis and an evaluation of the effects of arylboronic acid substitution on the reaction rate point toward turnover-limiting ionization of the allylic alcohol, with Lewis acid activation by the boronic acid. Computational modeling of the reaction pathway with density functional theory indicates that allylic alcohol ionization is also the regioselectivity-determining step and that the resulting ion pair undergoes C&#8211;N bond formation through an outer-sphere mechanism. An unexpected observation of autocatalysis that emerged from the kinetic analysis motivated a study of the effects of additives, leading to the development of an improved protocol.</description>

      <title>Photoenzymatic Redox-Neutral Radical Hydrosulfonylation Initiated by FMN</title>

                The photoinduced unnatural reactions catalyzed by flavin-dependent enzymes usually proceed through reduction pathways, which required the use of electron-sacrificial reagents. Herein, we developed a photoenzymatic redox-neutral radical hydrosulfonylation induced by oxidated flavin (FMN) with sulfinates or sulfonyl hydrazines as radical precursors. The reaction involved the excited FMN acquiring an electron from the substrate, and the resulting sulfuryl radical was captured by an alkene. It is then stereoselectively quenched by flavin semiquinone (FMNsq) through hydrogen atom transfer. This study circumvents the need for NADPH recycling systems and expands the potential reaction patterns in photobiocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder Reaction of 2-Methylbenzaldehydes and 2-Alkylbenzophenones with Chromones</title>

                The asymmetric photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder reaction provides a straightforward and atom-economical route to complex chiral polycyclic rings. In comparison with well-developed transformations of 2-alkylbenzophenones, the enantioselective photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2-methylbenzaldehydes was challenging due to the shorter-lived and unstable photoenol intermediates. Herein, we present a highly enantioselective photoenolization/Diels&#8211;Alder reaction of 2-methylbenzaldehydes with chromones. Chiral N,N&#8242;-dioxide/ScIII and YbIII complexes were found to interact with both photoenol intermediates and chromones simultaneously, accelerating the Diels&#8211;Alder reaction in an efficient and stereoselective manner. Experimental studies and DFT calculations were carried out to understand the reaction mechanism and the origin of stereoselectivity. In addition, 2-alkylbenzophenones were suitable substrates. A series of chiral fused polycyclic rings with vicinal multisubstituted stereocenters were afforded in good yields and high diastereo- and enantioselectivities.</description>

                Robust earth-abundant transition metal-based photocatalysts are needed for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. A series of six Ni(II) complexes have been synthesized with a tridentate CNC pincer ligand composed of two imidazole or benzimidazole-derived N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) rings and a pyridyl ring with different R substituents (R = OMe, Me, H) para to N of the pyridine ring. These complexes have been characterized by using spectroscopic, analytic, and crystallographic methods. The electrochemical properties of all complexes were studied by cyclic voltammetry under N2 and CO2 atmospheres. Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO and HCO2&#8211; was analyzed using all of the complexes in the presence and absence of an external photosensitizer (PS). All of these complexes are active as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction with and without the presence of an external PS with appreciable turnover numbers (TONs) for formate (HCO2&#8211;) production and typically lower amounts of CO. Notably, all Ni(II) CNC-pincer complexes in this series are also active as self-sensitized photocatalysts. Complex 4Me with a benzimidazole-derived CNC pincer ligand was found to be the most active self-sensitized photocatalyst. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) experiments and computational studies were performed to understand the mechanism of these catalysts. Whereas sensitized catalysis involves halide loss to produce more active complexes, self-sensitized catalysis requires some halide to remain coordinated to allow for favorable electron transfer between the excited nickel complex and the sacrificial electron donor. This then allows the nickel complex to undergo CO2 reduction catalysis via NiI or Ni0 catalytic cycles. The two active species (NiI and Ni0) demonstrate distinct reactivity and selectivity which influences the formation of CO vs formate as the product.</description>

                The formation and stabilization of Cu+ species are important to develop efficient Cu-based catalysts for the catalytic transfer hydrodeoxygenation (CTHDO) of renewable biomass to value-added products but challenging. Herein, we demonstrate that the introduction of atomically dispersed Zr species into a CuOx matrix (Cu10Zr0.39Ox) greatly promoted its catalytic activity and stability for the CTHDO of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF). In particular, almost quantitative DMF yield could be implemented over Cu10Zr0.39Ox accompanied by an impressive DMF formation rate of 8.1 mmolDMF&#183;gcat&#8211;1&#183;h&#8211;1, which outperforms the existing works for the CTHDO of HMF to DMF. Experimental and theoretical observations revealed that the electronic interactions between the doped Zr atom species and CuOx enabled the generation of ample and stable Cu+ species. The single-atom Zr species also promoted the adsorption and activation of the substrates and worked synergistically with Cu+ species to boost the CTHDO of HMF by reducing the reaction energy barriers.</description>

                Photoelectrochemical water splitting and CO2 reduction provide an attractive route to produce solar fuels while reducing the level of CO2 emissions. Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been extensively studied for this purpose in recent years due to their suitable optoelectronic properties. In this review, we survey the recent achievements in the field. After a brief introduction to photoelectrochemical (PEC) processes, we discussed the properties, synthesis, and application of MHPs in this context. We also survey the state-of-the-art findings regarding significant achievements in performance, and developments in addressing the major challenges of toxicity and instability toward water. Efforts have been made to replace the toxic Pb with less toxic materials like Sn, Ge, Sb, and Bi. The stability toward water has been also improved by using various methods such as compositional engineering, 2D/3D perovskite structures, surface passivation, the use of protective layers, and encapsulation. In the last part, considering the experience gained in photovoltaic applications, we provided our perspective for the future challenges and opportunities. We place special emphasis on the improvement of stability as the major challenge and the potential contribution of machine learning to identify the most suitable formulation for halide perovskites with desired properties.</description>

      <title>Coupling Waste Plastic Upgrading and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Photoreduction to High-Value Chemicals by a Binuclear Re&#8211;Ru Heterogeneous Catalyst</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00444</link>
      <description>Mei Li, Shengbo Zhang, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394857095

                Photocatalytically converting waste plastic to high-value chemicals is an energy-efficient and promising approach. Nonetheless, the limited photocatalytic efficiency due to the extremely low water solubility of the plastic and the excessive release of CO2 caused by overoxidation during the reaction seriously restricts its practical application. Herein, we propose a tandem process of waste Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic degradation and CO2 photoreduction on a chelating-ligand-anchored binuclear Re&#8211;Ru molecular heterogeneous catalyst. Specifically, waste PET plastics are depolymerized and photo-oxidized to monomers and formic acid on the molecular Ru sites, while the CO2 gas externally purged and generated in situ is photoreduced to CO with an impressive TON of 115 on the molecular Re sites. Compared with the corresponding homogeneous catalyst, the product selectivity is significantly improved from 65 to 95% in water-containing systems, and the TON is also greatly increased by nearly 19 times. Experiments and density functional theory calculations reveal that the high photocatalytic performance is attributed to the significantly enhanced light-capture capability, efficient photogenerated electron transfer between bimetallic Re&#8211;Ru sites, and substantially enhanced CO2-trapping capacity by finely regulating the chelating-ligand-based organosilica nanotube framework structure. The real-world application in nature seawater indicates that this work will provide a practical and feasible technical route for the disposal of waste plastics and mitigating carbon emissions under environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Key Role of CO Coverage for Chain Growth in Co-Based Fischer&#8211;Tropsch Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c04844</link>

                Fischer&#8211;Tropsch synthesis converts CO and H2 to long-chain hydrocarbons. The reaction mechanism, a combination of C&#8211;O scission, C&#8211;C coupling, and hydrogenation steps, and the nature of the active sites remain intensely debated. In this work, we report a comprehensive, dual-site microkinetic model including more than 600 reversible reactions. Our model explicitly accounts for the high CO surface coverage under the reaction conditions by including a CO saturation coverage in the underlying DFT calculations. The model predictions match experimental kinetic observations with a methane selectivity of 18%, a chain growth probability of 0.83, a turnover frequency of 0.084 s&#8211;1, and an activation energy of 107 kJ/mol. A degree of rate control analysis identifies 12 rate-controlling steps, highlighting the challenges in building compact kinetic models based on one or two rate controlling steps. In the dominant reaction mechanism, CO is activated both at B5 step sites and at the terrace sites via H- and hydroxyl-assisted pathways. Chain growth occurs on the crowded terraces predominantly via CH coupling to alkylidine chains. While B5 step sites facilitate CO activation, a small concentration of 5% is sufficient to establish a quasi-equilibrium CH coverage on the terraces and higher concentrations do not notably change the model predictions.</description>

                Thermal approaches have played a dominant role in driving chemical reactions within the chemicals and fuels industries, benefiting from ongoing enhancements in efficiency via heat integration, catalyst development, and process intensification. Nevertheless, these traditional thermal approaches remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels, and there exists an urgent demand for the implementation of renewable energy technologies to synthesize fuels, commodity chemicals, and specialty chemicals. Nonthermal plasmas have gained considerable attention in recent years as a promising solution, and the prospects of combining plasmas with suitable catalysts have become even more appealing. Moreover, the evolution of nonthermal plasma catalysis approaches for the generation of clean hydrogen could be transformative in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This comprehensive review highlights the influential contributions in plasma catalysis for hydrogen production, discusses recent advancements, and provides future prospects for researchers aiming to advance the production of clean hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Water-Mediated Photocatalytic Coproduction of Diesel Fuel Additives and Hydrogen from Dimethyl Ether</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01132</link>

                Dimethyl ether (DME) coupling via prior C&#8211;H bond scission affords H2 and long-chain oxygenates that can be used as diesel fuel additives. However, the C&#8211;H bond of DME is recalcitrant, requiring activation by oxidants for subsequent C&#8211;C bond coupling, and overoxidation to CO2 by nonselective oxidants is inevitable. Here, by establishing a channel for hole transfer from the Pt/TiO2 photocatalyst to DME, the C&#8211;H bond of DME is broken, affording H2 and diesel fuel additives consisting of glycol dimethyl ether (GDE) and oligomers. Adsorbed water on Pt/TiO2 fosters hole transfer by forming hydrogen bonds with both Pt/TiO2 surface and DME. Because of the hydrogen bonding, photogenerated holes are extracted from Pt/TiO2 by water and eventually transferred to DME. As a result, the productivities of the diesel fuel and H2 are increased by 8.7 and 12.4 folds, respectively. This work provides a route to produce two kinds of fuels from an abundant feedstock.</description>

      <title>Differentiating Plasmon-Enhanced Chemical Reactions on AgPd Hollow Nanoplates through Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>

                Plasmonic photocatalysis demonstrates great potential for efficiently harnessing light energy. However, the underlying mechanisms remain enigmatic due to the transient nature of the reaction processes. Typically, plasmonic photocatalysis relies on the excitation of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in plasmonic materials, such as metal nanoparticles, leading to the generation of high-energy or "hot electrons", albeit accompanied by photothermal heating or Joule effect. The ability of hot electrons to participate in chemical reactions is one of the key mechanisms, underlying the enhanced photocatalytic activity observed in plasmonic photocatalysis. Interestingly, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy allows the analysis of chemical reactions driven by hot electrons, as both SERS and hot electrons stem from the decay of SPR and occur at the hot spots. Herein, we propose a highly efficient SERS substrate based on cellulose paper loaded with either Ag nanoplates (Ag NPs) or AgPd hollow nanoplates (AgPd HNPs) for the in situ monitoring of C&#8211;C homocoupling reactions. The data analysis allowed us to disentangle the impact of hot electrons and the Joule effect on plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis. Computational simulations revealed an increase in the rate of excitation of hot carriers from single/isolated AgPd HNPs to an in-plane with a vertical stacking assembly, suggesting its promise as a photocatalyst under broadband light. In addition, the results suggest that the incorporation of Pd into an alloy with plasmonic properties may enhance its catalytic performance under light irradiation due to the collection of plasmon-excitation-induced hot electrons. This work has demonstrated the performance-oriented synthesis of hybrid nanostructures, providing a unique route to uncover the mechanism of plasmon-enhanced photocatalysis.</description>

                Directed evolution of enzymes often fails to obtain desirable variants because of the difficulty in exploring a huge sequence space. To obtain active variants from a very limited number of variants available at the laboratory scale, machine learning (ML)-guided engineering of enzymes is becoming an attractive methodology. However, as far as we know, there is no example of an ML-guided functional modification of flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO). FMOs are known to catalyze a variety of oxidative reactions and are involved in the biosynthesis of many natural products (NPs). Therefore, it is expected that the ML-guided functional enhancement of FMO can contribute to the efficient development of NP derivatives. In this research, we focused on p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PHBH), a model FMO, and altered only four amino acid residues around the substrate binding site. ML models were trained with a small initial library covering only approximately 0.1% of the whole sequence space, and the ML-predicted second library was enriched with active variants. The variant with the highest activity in the second library was PHBH-MWNL (V47M, W185, L199N, and L210), whose activity was more than 100 times that of the wild-type PHBH. For elucidation of the mechanism of the observed activity enhancement, the crystal structure of PHBH-MWNL in complex with 4-hydroxy-3-methyl benzoic acid was determined. In the PHBH-MWNL crystal structure, the missing water molecule WAT2 was observed due to N199 hydrogen-bonding to WAT2, indicating that the L199N mutation contributed to the observed functional improvement by stabilizing the proton relay network proposed to be important in catalysis.</description>

                Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) of organics offers a promising route for producing value-added chemicals. However, a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanism limits the efficient design of the catalysts. Herein, the two mechanisms are essentially identified on the Ni-based catalysts for acetonitrile hydrogenation, with a deeper understanding of their characteristics in view of their different performances. On this basis, an insight into the shift of the mechanism is proposed. Meanwhile, the optimization strategy of ECH is discovered, and the construction of Tafel sites (Ni/NiO interfaces) can greatly accelerate the kinetics, in addition to increasing the reactant coverage on the catalysts by modulating the electronic structures. Understanding the underlying mechanisms helps in manipulating the design of more efficient ECH catalysts.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Catalyst Corrosion and Homogeneous Reactive Oxygen Species in Electrochemical Ozone Production</title>

                Electrochemical ozone production (EOP), a six-electron water oxidation reaction, offers promising avenues for creating value-added oxidants and disinfectants. However, progress in this field is slowed by a dearth of understanding of fundamental reaction mechanisms. In this work, we combine experimental electrochemistry, spectroscopic detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxygen-anion chemical ionization mass spectrometry, and computational quantum chemistry calculations to determine a plausible reaction mechanism on nickel- and antimony-doped tin oxide (Ni/Sb&#8211;SnO2, NATO), one of the most selective EOP catalysts. Antimony doping is shown to increase the conductivity of the catalyst, leading to improved electrochemical performance. Spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical experiments combined with quantum chemistry predictions reveal that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a critical reaction intermediate. We propose that leached Ni4+ cations catalyze hydrogen peroxide into solution phase hydroperoxyl radicals (&#8226;OOH); these radicals are subsequently oxidized to ozone. Isotopic product analysis shows that ozone is generated catalytically from water and corrosively from the catalyst oxide lattice without regeneration of lattice oxygens. Further quantum chemistry calculations and thermodynamic analysis suggest that the electrochemical corrosion of tin oxide itself might generate hydrogen peroxide, which is then catalyzed to ozone. The proposed pathways explain both the roles of dopants in NATO and its lack of stability. Our study interrogates the possibility that instability and electrochemical activity are intrinsically linked through the formation of ROS. In doing so, we provide the first mechanism for EOP that is consistent with computational and experimental results and highlight the central challenge of instability as a target for future research efforts.</description>

      <title>Substantial Impact of Spin State Evolution in OER/ORR Catalyzed by Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c06122</link>

                The Fe-embedded N-doped graphene (Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C) is the most representative single atom catalyst (SAC) that has shown great potentiality in electrocatalysis, such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the active moiety of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C is still elusive due to contradictory experimental results. Moreover, early simulations mainly focus on the thermodynamic potential of adsorbates, while the effect of spin multiplicity receives little attention. To explore the role of spin multiplicity in electrocatalysis, we employ the constant-potential density functional theory (DFT) to systematically study the structural evolution of the high-spin (HS) and intermediate-spin (IS) FeN4 site (marked by FeN4HS/IS) in OER and ORR processes. With the consideration of spin multiplicity, our simulation shows spontaneous oxidation from Fe(II)N4IS to Fe(III)N4HS at potential U = 0.4 V versus SHE. Further simulation indicates that the FeN4IS site undergoes a sequential adsorption of *OH and *OOH along with U increase, which leads to the spin state transition from IS to HS. According to the constant-potential free energy analysis, the FeN4HS*OOH is confirmed to be the practical active centers of OER, while the FeN4HS*OH and FeN4IS are assigned to the active center of ORR in low and high overpotentials. The predicted ORR activity of FeN4HS*OH agrees with the in situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy measurement by Xiao et al. [Microporous Framework Induced Synthesis of Single-Atom Dispersed Fe-NC Acidic ORR Catalyst and its In Situ Reduced Fe-N4 Active Site Identification Revealed by X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy. ACS Catal. 2018, 8, 2824&#8211;2832]. Based on the geometry and orbital analysis, the bond length of Fe&#8211;N and coordination number of Fe center are found to have a significant impact on the d orbital splitting energy and thus induce the turnover of HS/IS stability in the OER/ORR intermediates. Our study brings comprehensive insights into the evolution of coordination and spin state in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C, which reveals the significance of spin multiplicity in electrocatalysis and benefits further theoretical design of SACs from the perspective of spin effects.</description>

                The synthesis of N&#8211;N axially chiral molecules in the enantiopure form has emerged as an interesting research topic primarily due to the significance and intricacy in synthesizing these molecules, especially bearing heterocyclic motifs. Herein, we disclose a method for the introduction of N&#8211;N axial chirality along with a point chiral center via the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-catalyzed atroposelective synthesis of dihydropyridinone-containing indoles and pyrroles. The reaction follows a (3 + 3) annulation approach by the interception of indole/pyrrole-derived enamines with &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes under oxidative NHC catalysis proceeding via the &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated acylazoliums. The N&#8211;N axially chiral indoles/pyrroles were formed under mild conditions in broad scope with high selectivity. In addition, preliminary DFT studies of the N&#8211;N rotational barrier of the axially chiral products were performed.</description>

                The synthesis of N&#8211;N axial compounds containing aromatic acyl amides using common acylation reagents remains challenging. We describe a highly atropenantioselective synthesis of N-aminoindoles containing N&#8211;N axes. A chiral cyclic isothiourea is used as the sole organic catalyst in the atropenantioselective transformation of the N-acylation reaction. Aroyl chlorides have been used as acylation reagents to construct atropisomeric compounds through N-acylation. The N-aminoindole products, which bear stereogenic N&#8211;N axes, were synthesized with high yields and enantioselectivities. Some of the enantiopure N-aminoindole products exhibited promising antibacterial activities against plant pathogens.</description>

      <title>Rational Design of Heteroatom-Doped Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Single-Atom Catalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction via Simple Descriptor</title>

                The coordination engineering of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C single-atom catalysts (SACs) through introducing heteroatom dopants has attracted widespread attention in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). However, the common regularity for tuning the ORR activity by coordinated and environmental heteroatoms has not been sufficiently studied. Herein, we study the ORR activity on 100 Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs with S, P, and B heteroatoms in diverse coordination shells by density functional theory calculations. Based on the energy level distribution of frontier orbits and molecular orbital theory, it is found that the origin of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C ORR activity is the hybridization of molecular orbitals of Fe 3dz2, 3dyz (3dxz), and O2*/OH* intermediates, where hybrid orbitals are adjusted by coordinated and environmental S, P, and B heteroatoms, and then the protonation process of O2* or OH* intermediate is determined. Moreover, we found that the Fe&#8211;O bond length, the d-orbital gap of spin states, the d-orbital center, and the valence state of the Fe site can be used as structural descriptors to predict the ORR activity governed by the protonation of O2* or OH* intermediate as potential-determining steps. Our structural descriptors rationalize the superior ORR performance of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C with S or B atoms doped in the second coordination shell to those in the first coordination shell, as well as the fact that the P heteroatom is more suitable as a coordinated atom than the environmental atom to enhance the ORR activity of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C, in available experimental references. Thanks to structural descriptors, the codoping synergistic effect between P in the first coordination shell and S in the second coordination shell is predicted and confirmed to greatly enhance the ORR activity. This study provides a unified mechanistic understanding on the ORR activity trend among Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C SACs regulated by coordinated and environmental heteroatoms.</description>

      <title>Exploring the High-Entropy Oxide Composition Space: Insights through Comparing Experimental with Theoretical Models for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05915</link>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key for the transition to a hydrogen-based energy economy. The observed activity of the OER catalysts arises from the combined effects of surface area, intrinsic activity, and stability. Therefore, alloys provide an effective platform to search for catalysts that balance these factors. In particular, high-entropy oxides provide a vast material composition space that could contain catalysts with optimal OER performance. In this work, the OER performance of the AuIrOsPdPtReRhRu composition space was modeled using an experimentally obtained dataset of 350 nanoparticles. This machine-learned model based on experimental data found the optimal catalyst to be a mixture of AuIrOsPdRu. However, as a "black-box model", it cannot explain the underlying chemistry. Therefore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to provide a complementary theoretical model with defined assumptions and, hence, a physical interpretation through comparison with the experimental model. The DFT calculations suggest that the majority of the activity originates from Ru and Ir active sites and that the addition of Pd improves the performance of these sites. However, the DFT calculation did not find the experimentally observed beneficial effects of Au and Os. Therefore, we hypothesize that the Os contributed to the performance of the tested catalysts by roughening the surface, whereas Au fulfilled the role of a structural support. Overall, it is demonstrated how machine learning can help accelerate catalyst discovery, and combining machine-learned models obtained from experimental data with models based on DFT calculations can provide important insights into the complex chemistry of OER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene-Stabilized Gold Nanoparticles for Selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05727</link>

                N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have recently gained significant attention as capping ligands for gold nanoparticles due to their strong &#963;-donation properties. It has already been established that the strong &#963;-donation of NHCs enriches the surface of the gold nanoparticles, which controls the catalytic activity of the metal nanoparticles. Cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) is a special class of carbene that offers stronger &#963;-donation than NHCs. This extremely electron-rich nature of CAAC projects it as a better surface capping ligand upon extrapolation on the Au(0) surface. In this work, we have isolated stable CAAC-stabilized AuNPs via a ligand exchange method and studied their catalytic behavior toward electrochemical CO2 reduction. These newly synthesized CAAC-stabilized AuNPs furnish a remarkable faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94% [at pH 6.3 for 2 h of controlled potential electrolysis at &#8722;0.7 V vs NHE (normal hydrogen electrode)] toward selective CO formation. Our work sets the platform for CAAC as a robust main group ligand on the surface of different metal nanoparticles, bridging the gap between main group ligands and surface chemistry.</description>
