      <title>Iron(I) and Iron(II) Amido-imidazolin-2-imine Complexes as Catalysts for H/D Exchange in Hydrosilanes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05355</link>
      <description>Noor U Din Reshi, Dirk Bockfeld, Dirk Baabe, Lars Denker, Jos&#233; Luis Garc&#237;a Mart&#237;nez, Bartosz Trzaskowski, Ren&#233; Frank, Matthias Tamm, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390966679

                The unsymmetrical amino-imidazolin-2-imine ligand [HAmIm, 1,2-(DippNH)&#8211;C6H4&#8211;N=C(NiPrCMe)2] is employed in the synthesis of the iron(I) arene complex [(AmIm)Fe(&#951;6-C6H6)] and the iron(II) neosilyl complex [(AmIm)Fe(CH2SiMe3)]. These compounds are highly efficient precatalysts in H/D exchange reactions with deuterium (D2) in hydrosilanes. The scope comprises primary to tertiary silanes at a catalyst loading of 1 mol % at ambient temperature. In-depth mechanistic studies including various control experiments and the syntheses of isolated iron-hydride and iron-silyl compounds are performed. These studies reveal that the activation of both Fe(I) and Fe(II) complexes generates Fe&#8211;H/D species as key catalytic intermediates. An alternative catalytic pathway involving an iron-silyl intermediate, although shown to be less feasible by DFT calculations, may also be operative.</description>

      <title>Platinum&#8211;Nickel Alloy Nanowire Electrocatalysts Transform into Pt-Skin Beads-on-Nanowires Keeping Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity During Potential Cycling</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c04709</link>
      <description>Yu Zhou, Yoshimi Iguchi, Tianchi Li, Masaru Kato, Yasir Arafat Hutapea, Akari Hayashi, Takeshi Watanabe, Ichizo Yagi, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390966737

                We synthesized PtNi alloy nanowires (PtNi NWs) at three different temperatures of 433, 494, and 533 K (NW433 K, NW494 K, and NW533 K, respectively) and then investigated their catalytic activity and durability for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in acidic media. Ni contents in the PtNi NWs increase as the synthesis temperatures increase from below 5 at. % for NW433 K up to about 15 at. % for NW493 K and NW553 K. PtNi nanoparticles (PtNi NPs), which are the unconsumed intermediate during the NW growth, also coexist for NW433 K and NW494 K but not for NW533 K. NW494 K and NW533 K show similar initial activity for the ORR but higher than NW433 K, suggesting that higher Ni contents are critical to achieving higher initial ORR activity. Accelerated durability tests (ADTs) show that NW493 K is the most durable, suggesting that the copresence of PtNi NPs is critical to durability. Only NW493 K, with a high Ni content of 15 at. % and coexisting PtNi NPs, gave better results in both cases. Scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy of PtNi NWs reveal a structural transformation of NW493 K into Pt-skin beads-on-nanowires, involving the Ostwald ripening of coexisting PtNi NPs. This structural transformation is coupled with changes in surface composition and surface electronic structure, as confirmed by the CO stripping voltammogram and in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, resulting in high durability and suppression of Pt and Ni dissolution. Understanding such structural transformation during potential cycling will help us to design and develop highly active and durable Pt-based electrocatalysts.</description>

                An asymmetric cascade cyclization of enynamides and &#945;-diazoketones to produce chiral bicyclic lactams bearing chiral all-carbon quaternary stereocenters is realized with up to 95% yield, 98% ee, and &gt;19:1 dr. The combination of visible light photoactivation and the relay of gold and N-oxide catalysis in a cascade process enabled the facile generation and controlled assembly of two reactive intermediates, ketene and aza-o-quinone methide. Theoretical calculations revealed a stepwise [4 + 2] cycloaddition mechanism, with the stereochemistry controlled by the amide group of the catalyst. Remarkably, this study presents the first example of chiral N-oxides serving as catalysts for asymmetric ketene cycloaddition and illustrates how a cascade strategy could be a promising means to access significant chiral heterocyclic scaffolds.</description>

      <title>Vanadium-Containing Chloroperoxidase-Catalyzed Versatile Valorization of Phenols and Phenolic Acids</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05333</link>

                The downstream product transformation of lignin depolymerization is of great interest in the production of high-value aromatic chemicals. However, this transformation is often impeded by chemical oxidation under harsh reaction conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that hypohalites generated in situ by the vanadium-containing chloroperoxidase from Curvularia inaequalis (CiVCPO) can halogenate various electron-rich and electron-poor phenol and phenolic acid substrates. Specifically, CiVCPO enabled decarboxylative halogenation, deformylative halogenation, halogenation, and direct oxidation reactions. The versatile transformation routes for the valorization of phenolic compounds showed up to 99% conversion and 99% selectivity, with a turnover number of 60,700 and a turnover frequency of 60 s&#8211;1 for CiVCPO. This study potentially expands the biocatalytic toolbox for lignin valorization.</description>

                Using methane as a reagent to synthesize high-value chemicals and high-energy density fuels through C&#8211;C coupling has attracted intense attention in recent decades, as it avoids completely breaking all C&#8211;H bonds in CH4. In the present study, we demonstrated that the coupling of HCHO with the CH3 species from CH4 activation to produce ethanol can be accomplished on the single Pd atom&#8211;In2O3 catalyst based on the results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results show that the supported single Pd atom stabilizes the CH3 species following the activation of one C&#8211;H bond of CH4, while HCHO adsorbs on the neighboring In site. Facile C&#8211;C coupling of HCHO with the methyl species is achieved with an activation barrier of 0.56 eV. We further examined the C&#8211;C coupling on other single metal atoms, including Ni, Rh, Pt, and Ag, supported on In2O3 by following a similar pathway and found that a balance of the three key steps for ethanol formation, i.e., CH4 activation, C&#8211;C coupling, and ethoxy hydrogenation, was achieved on Pd/In2O3. Taking the production of acetaldehyde and ethylene on the Pd/In2O3 catalyst into consideration, the DFT-based microkinetic analysis indicates that ethanol is the dominant product on the Pd/In2O3 catalyst. The facile C&#8211;C coupling between HCHO and dissociated CH4 makes formaldehyde a potential C1 source in the conversion and utilization of methane through an energy- and atom-efficient process.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Enhanced Selectivity of Electrocatalyzing Ethanol to High Value-Added Acetaldehyde Through Tuning the Cobalt Valence State</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c03326</link>
      <description>Yintong Zhang, Junhao Wu, Tao Li, H.J. Li, Yongcai Zhang, Xuepeng Wu, Yong Zhou, Zhigang Zou, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390975321

                Using electrochemical oxidation of alcohols to substitute the oxygen evolution reaction is beneficial to reduce the energy consumption of hydrogen production. Converting alcohols into high value-added products with high efficiency and selectivity by designing a proper electrocatalyst is economical and has promising applications. In this work, two types of spinel cubic phase Co3O4 with different contents of oxygen vacancies were obtained by annealing the same precursor in air and argon gas atmosphere, respectively. The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ Raman spectra reveal that abundant Co4+ sites were formed on the surface of Co3O4&#8211;air under the electrocatalysis condition, while main Co3+ sites were formed on the surface of Co3O4&#8211;Ar. The electrocatalytic ethanol oxidation tests and density functional theory calculation reveal that the Co4+ sites exhibit more proper adsorption energy to the O&#9552;*CCH3 intermediate, which benefits the formation of high-value-added acetaldehyde products instead of common acetic acid products with a higher degree of oxidation. The Faradaic efficiency of the Co3O4&#8211;air catalyst to acetaldehyde achieves 60.02%, and the selectivity to acetaldehyde reaches 79.63% at an oxidation overpotential of 1.46 V. This work provides the possibility and guidance for electrochemical oxidation of alcohols into high value-added products.</description>

      <title>Photocatalytic Conversion of Lipid to Diesel and Syngas via Engineering the Surface Proton Transfer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c04818</link>
      <description>Zhiwei Chen, Hongru Zhou, Fangfang Kong, Zhaolin Dou, Min Wang, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390977302

                Photocatalysis provides a promising pathway for the production of fuels and chemicals from biomass, where the slow proton reduction by surface-confined photoinduced electrons limits the efficiency. Herein, we propose to engineer the surface structure to facilitate the proton transfer on the catalyst surface and thus promote the proton reduction by the confined photoinduced electrons. We found introducing NH4+ on TiO2 (NH4&#8211;TiO2) could improve the proton conductivity. The NH4+ group effectively minimizes the proton transfer distance and promotes proton transfer by forming hydrogen-bond networks. Consequently, NH4&#8211;TiO2 shows a high yield of (&#8805;80%) alkanes from bio-derived fatty acids which is about 3.8 times that of pristine TiO2. Glycerol can be reformed to syngas with a generation rate [CO (0.69 mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1)/H2 (0.21 mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1)]. Moreover, industrial palm oil can be converted into 59% alkanes and syngas [4% CO and H2 (0.04 mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1)] via a hydrolysis-photocatalysis two-step process. This work provides an efficient approach for biomass upgrading via a rationally controlled proton transfer process.</description>

      <title>Copper-Catalyzed General and Selective &#945;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H Silylation of Amides via 1,5-Hydrogen Atom Transfer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05651</link>

                The development of a general and selective method for &#945;-C(sp3)&#8211;H silylation of feedstock amines has been a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we disclose a mild, general, practical, and highly regio- and diastereoselective &#945;-C(sp3)&#8211;H silylation of various readily available acyclic, cyclic, and aromatic amines with silylboranes through a copper-catalyzed intramolecular 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) strategy. The mild activation of 2-iodobenzamide to generate an aryl radical enabled by a ligand-coordinated silyl copper complex without additional heating or photoinduced conditions, as well as the intramolecular selective 1,5-HAT process to produce the crucial &#945;-aminoalkyl radical species, is the key to the success of this chemistry. This silylation protocol has demonstrated its potential utility in the late-stage modification of structurally complex drugs and bioactive molecules. Therefore, it is expected that this method will find applications in synthetic chemistry and drug discovery.</description>

                Photocatalytic oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to ethane promises a route to value-added C2 products from an abundant and low-cost feedstock. However, selective activation of the C&#8211;H bond of CH4 without overoxidation to CO2 has been a major challenge. In this work, we present the use of Au-modified Bi2WO6 as a prototypical photocatalyst, demonstrating a high performance of OCM through photocatalysis. A C2H6 production rate at 1.69 &#215; 103 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8211;1&#183;h&#8211;1 with approximately 85% selectivity was achieved, which ranks among the top-performing photocatalytic OCM systems. Efforts were also made in establishing a correlation between improved OCM performance and the photocatalyst system by examining the nature of the oxide photocatalyst. Our findings indicated that oxygen within the oxide surface, likely from adsorbed and subsequently dissociated oxygen at the vacancy sites, afforded a desired reactivity to selectively activate the C&#8211;H bond without significant overoxidation. Surprisingly, it was revealed that the Au cocatalyst plays dual roles of activating the oxide photocatalyst for enhanced CH4 activation and promoting C&#8211;C coupling to yield C2H6 as the main product.</description>

                Chiral alcohols are versatile building blocks and are of particular interest in the asymmetric synthesis of nonracemic active pharmaceutical ingredients, agrochemicals, fragrances, flavors, natural products, etc. Herein, we report on a &#8220;one-pot sequential two-step&#8221; concurrent oxidation&#8211;reduction photobiocatalytic process to synthesize enantiomerically enriched alcohols. In this regard, an efficient photocatalytic system based on irradiation with 440 nm blue LEDs in the presence of 9-fluorenone as a metal-free photocatalyst and molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant in dry DMSO as the hydrogen peroxide-neutralizing agent was used to oxidize a broad range of racemic (hetero)benzylic alcohols into prochiral ketones quantitively (&gt;99% conv.). The in situ formed carbonyl compounds were subsequently converted into the corresponding chiral alcohols via a sequential biocatalytic transhydrogenation catalyzed by lyophilized E. coli cells overexpressing highly stereoselective and stereocomplementary recombinant alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) originated from Rhodococcus ruber (E. coli/ADH-A) or Rhodococcus erythropolis (E. coli/ReADH) to obtain (S)-alcohols and Lactobacillus kefir (E. coli/Lk-ADH) or KRED-110 to obtain (R)-alcohols, respectively. Overall, the elaborated photobiocatalytic deracemization of racemic alcohols using a 9-fluorenone-O2-blue LED-DMSO-E. coli/ADH system carried out on a semipreparative scale (0.25 mmol; 63 mM final conc. in 4 mL) at room temperature yielded nonracemic aryl alcohols with 82&#8211;99.9% conv., in up to 92% isolated yield, with 97&#8211;99.9% ee and complementary chirality.</description>

      <title>CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Hydrogenation with High Selectivity by Single Bi Atoms on MXenes Enabled by a Concerted Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c04480</link>
      <description>Kaifeng Niu, Lin Chen, Johanna Ros&#233;n, Jonas Bj&#246;rk, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391025688

                Developing efficient catalysts for the capture and direct conversion of CO2 into various chemicals is essential to alleviate CO2 emissions and minimize the negative environmental effects of fossil fuels. Combining density functional theory calculations and microkinetic analysis, we propose that single Bi atoms supported on V2CO2 MXenes (Bi@V2CO2) are promising single-atom catalysts (SAC) for CO2 hydrogenation. The catalytic performance of Bi SACs is ensured by the stable single-atom dispersion of Bi atoms on V2CO2 and enhanced adsorption of CO2. Of importance, Bi@V2CO2 exhibits remarkable selectivity toward the synthesis of formic acid (HCOOH), in which the main competing reaction, namely, the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) and the formation of CO, is strictly prohibited. In contrast to conventional Cu or In2O3 catalysts, CO2 hydrogenation exhibits a unique mechanism on Bi@V2CO2, in which the formic acid is directly generated via a concerted pathway. As a result, the formation of both intermediate HCOO and COOH is prevented, leading to high selectivity (nearly 100%) toward HCOOH on Bi@V2CO2. Moreover, analysis of the kinetic behavior suggests that the stabilization of HCOOH adsorption would be an effective approach to promote catalyst performance toward methanol synthesis.</description>

      <title>Partially Bonded Aluminum Site on the External Surface of Post-treated Au/ZSM-5 Enhances Methane Oxidation to Oxygenates</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05030</link>
      <description>Jun Cao, Guodong Qi, Bingqing Yao, Qian He, Richard J. Lewis, Lu Xu, Feng Deng, Jun Xu, Graham J. Hutchings, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391026262

                Au nanoparticles supported on the exterior surface of the ZSM-5 zeolite (Au/ZSM-5) have shown the ability to partially oxidize methane to methanol and acetic acid. However, further improvements to the catalyst activity are required. This study investigates the effect of modifying the acidic properties of the ZSM-5 support through a desilication&#8211;recrystallization (DR) process on the activity of Au/ZSM-5 catalysts toward methane oxidation. A DR treatment of 24 h leads to a 50% higher oxygenate yield compared to the analogous catalyst prepared using the untreated support. Characterization using solid-state 27Al NMR and FTIR adsorption of pyridine and 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine reveals that DR induces framework dealumination and redistribution of Br&#248;nsted acid sites to the zeolite external surface. Two-dimensional 27Al MQMAS NMR further identifies partially coordinated framework Al sites on the zeolite surface, correlating with a higher oxygenate yield. These external acid sites help stabilize the Au nanoparticles, enhancing catalyst stability for methane partial oxidation.</description>

                Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTIL) are important alternatives to aqueous electrolytes in electrocatalytic reactions, batteries, and fuel cells. They are known to reduce existing high overpotentials and increase CO2 solubility as well as product selectivity in CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). In our work, we have studied the activity for CO2RR of Au(111), Cu(111), and Cu-modified Au(111) electrodes with 1/3, 2/3, and 3/3 Cu monolayers, as well as of AuCu and AuCu3 intermetallics in contact with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [BMIM][NTf2] electrolytes with 1.5 M H2O. Using offline gas chromatography (GC), we demonstrate the formation of H2 and mainly CO as the only reduction products at Au(111), while exclusively H2 is formed at Cu(111). Synergistic electronic and geometric effects lead to higher levels of CO formation at Cu-modified Au(111) electrodes in comparison to neat Au(111). Operando IR absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) of the bulk electrolyte shows the formation of a 2-imidazolium carboxylic acid intermediate that can lower the overpotential for CO2 reduction and does not require stabilization of a CO2&#8211; radical anion as an alternative intermediate at the interface. Systematic variation of the copper content at the catalysts&#8217; surfaces enables us to adjust the H2/CO syngas ratio to a maximum of 1.8 for Cu-modified Au(111) electrodes and &#8764;3.2 for AuCu3 catalysts at electrolysis times of 20 min, demonstrating a large tunability of the syngas ratio with electrode potential. The observed range of H2/CO ratios includes the ideal ratio of 2 for the Fischer&#8211;Tropsch process to produce hydrocarbons and the ratio of 3 needed for methanation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Full Dynamical and Reactivity Profiles of Acetylcholinesterase: A Comprehensive All-Atom Investigation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05560</link>
      <description>Fr&#233;d&#233;ric C&#233;lerse, Louis Lagard&#232;re, Yasmine Bouchibti, Florian Nachon, Laurent Verdier, Jean&#8208;Philip Piquemal, &#201;tienne Derat, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391030933

                Acetylcholinesterase is one of the most significant known serine hydrolases that governs the mammalian nervous system. Its high-rate speed, operating at the diffusion limit, combined with its buried active site feature, has made it a subject of extensive research over the last decades. Despite several studies focused on atomistic details of the different steps, a comprehensive theoretical investigation of the entire catalytic cycle has not yet been reported. In this work, we present an intuitive workflow aiming at describing the full dynamical and reactive profiles of AChE by coupling extensive steered molecular dynamics simulations for ligand diffusion and hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics computations to decipher the complete reactivity of the substrate within the enzyme. This comprehensive approach provides a broader view of the interconnections between each step that would not be readily accessible if the two steps were studied independently. Our simulations reveal that although individual steps do not indicate any strong limiting step, a solvent water molecule reorganization between the acylation and deacylation processes through the reactivity results in an energy cost of 20 kcal/mol. The observed barrier surpasses all others and discloses insights into a strong polarization effect acting on water molecules near the active site. An AMOEBA polarizable molecular dynamics simulation tends to confirm this assumption by capturing a substantial dipole moment (3.10 D) on the water molecule closest to the reaction site. These results shed light on the crucial correlation between this high-energy water reorganization and the polarization of confined water molecules. Consequently, carefully considering and modeling buried (polarizable) water molecules are of paramount importance when modeling full enzymatic activity. Therefore, this work will also provide valuable insights for future research on related enzymes with buried active sites.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c04329</link>
      <description>Gaobo Lin, Haoan Fan, Yiqiang Zhan, Chao Chen, Xing&#8208;Ming Zhao, Wenwen Lin, Bolong Li, Jianghao Wang, Jing Li, Weiyu Song, Jie Fu, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391042081

                As a potential alternative to petroleum-derived terephthalic acid (TPA), the general production of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) through 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation has fallen short of industrial expectations due to HMF&#8217;s storage instability and cost. Here, we propose a strategy involving Ru cation coordination manipulation to achieve efficient oxidation of 5-methoxymethylfurfural (MMF) to FDCA by constructing a Ru&#8211;Ce paired site on a CeO2-doped hydroxyapatite precursor (CeO2&#8211;HAP). By optimizing reaction conditions, the RuOx/CeO2&#8211;HAP catalyst demonstrated a complete MMF conversion of 100% and a high FDCA yield of 83.7% under base-free conditions (130 &#176;C, 5 bar O2 pressure, 15 h). Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed a strong interaction between Ru and Ce with electron transfer from Ce to Ru. Density functional theory (DFT) computations indicated that the strong d&#8211;d &#960; and &#963; orbital interactions between Ru and Ce provided sufficient electrons for the vacant orbitals of Ru, dispersing the density of states (DOS) of orbitals around the low energy level to facilitate MMF and FDCA adsorption with appropriate strength, thereby enhancing the MMF oxidation process. This study not only provides an MMF oxidation catalyst with high activity but also conducts a comprehensive investigation into the impact of the Ru&#8211;Ce interaction on MMF oxidation, offering insights into the subsequent production of high-value-added products such as FDCA.</description>

      <title>Promotion of Anatase/Rutile Junction to Direct Conversion of Syngas to Ethanol on the Rh/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05351</link>
      <description>Yang Feng, Yang Zhang, Jungang Wang, Lixia Ling, Riguang Zhang, Maohong Fan, Bo Hou, Debao Li, Baojun Wang, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391044381

                Although significant efforts have been made for the direct syngas conversion to ethanol, ethanol yield remains low. Herein, we studied syngas conversion on the Rh/TiO2 catalysts with different TiO2 phase compositions. The ethanol selectivity and yield reached 34.9 and 19.4%, respectively, at a 55.7% CO conversion on the Rh/P25 catalyst. Among the supported single Rh catalysts, this is currently the highest reported ethanol yield. The catalyst also shows good stability. The mixture of anatase&#8211;rutile phases in the P25 promotes the electron transfer from P25 to Rh species because of the strong metal&#8211;support interaction. It boosts the Rh0 active site generation, the CO dissociation, and CHx species formation, which is the significant intermediate for ethanol formation. In contrast, the Rh supported on the pure phase anatase or rutile TiO2 presents poor ethanol yield, which mainly produces the Rh+ species. This study provides an effective method to improve the ethanol yield for direct syngas conversion.</description>

                Surface oxygen vacancies in the catalysts play a key role in improving the catalytic performances for low-temperature oxidative coupling of methane (OCM). Herein, macroporous La2Ce2&#8211;xCaxO7&#8722;&#948; (A2B2O7-type) catalysts with a disordered defective cubic fluorite phased structure were prepared by a citric acid sol&#8211;gel method. The macroporous structure improved the accessibility of the reactants (O2 and CH4) to the active sites. The partial substitution of the B site (Ce) with low-valence calcium (Ca) ions in La2Ce2&#8211;xCaxO7&#8722;&#948; catalysts induced the formation of surface oxygen vacancies, which facilitated the adsorption and activation of O2 molecules to generate the active oxygen species (O2&#8211; species). The O2&#8211; species can boost the activation of CH4 and govern the following step of the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. La2Ce2&#8211;xCaxO7&#8722;&#948; catalysts have high catalytic activity for low-temperature OCM, and the La2Ce1.3Ca0.7O7&#8722;&#948; catalyst with the highest density of O2&#8211; species exhibits the highest catalytic activity during low-temperature OCM into C2H4 and C2H6 (C2) products, i.e., its CH4 conversion, selectivity, and yield of C2 products at 600 &#176;C are 31.0, 65.6, and 20.3%, respectively. Based on the results of multiple experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations, the mechanism of La2Ce2&#8211;xCaxO7&#8722;&#948; catalysts for the OCM reaction is proposed: surface oxygen vacancies induced by the substitution of the Ce site with Ca ions significantly promote the critical steps of C&#8211;H bond breaking and C&#8211;C bond coupling during the low-temperature OCM reaction. It is important for the design of low-temperature and high-efficiency catalysts for practical applications.</description>

      <description>Ramon Arora, Mark Lautens, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391096631

                A nickel/blue light-catalyzed carbohalogenation reaction is reported. A nickel catalyst and an inexpensive phosphine ligand promote the reaction of aryl iodides and aryl bromides with &#960; systems to enable the construction of a library of halogenated heterocyclic scaffolds. Mechanistic studies provide insight regarding fundamental steps of the catalytic cycle, including the reversible C&#8211;X bond formation via deuterium labeling and EPR experiments, while preliminary enantioselective results suggest a two-electron migratory insertion.</description>

      <title>Atomic Single-Layer Ir Clusters Enabling 100% Selective Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05738</link>

                The exclusive selectivity of the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) is crucial for the chlor-alkali industry to obtain pure chlorine gas and avoid the cost of separating the byproduct oxygen. However, 100% CER selectivity remains a challenge for the currently known CER catalysts. Here, we report a catalyst of atomic single-layer Ir clusters on CeO2 nanorods (IrSL/CeO2). Under the strong metal/support interaction, IrSL has a strong adsorption to oxygen, thereby suppressing the oxygen evolution reaction. Coupled with the uniform active sites of the single-layer Ir clusters, IrSL/CeO2 achieves almost 100% CER selectivity in acidic NaCl solution ranging from open circuit potential to practical current density levels. In addition, IrSL/CeO2 exhibits 1.7 times higher catalytic activity than its single-atom counterparts, and its noble metal efficiency is 84 times higher than that of commercial anodes (DSAs). Our finding provides a solution to the selective catalysis of chlor-alkali electrolysis.</description>

      <title>Subsurface Mo Vacancy in Bismuth Molybdate Promotes Photocatalytic Oxidation of Lactate to Pyruvate</title>

      <description>Haijun Chen, Ruohan Xu, Dan Chen, Tianliang Lu, H. Li, Min Wang, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391096818

                Disclosing the role of subsurface metal defects in photocatalysts remains challenging, although defect engineering has been a fundamental method for manipulating the photocatalytic transformation performance. Herein, the subsurface Mo vacancy-rich Bi2MoO6 was prepared and the role of its effects on photocatalysis was revealed. The presence of metal vacancy enhances the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers through both the holes captured by the oxygen atoms neighboring the Mo vacancy and the generation of an internal electric field, which is revealed by experimental results and density functional theory calculations. The boosted separation efficiency of electron&#8211;hole pairs improves the generation of 1O2, which is the final active species for photocatalytic oxidation of ethyl lactate. The conversion of ethyl lactate reaches to &gt;99% over the subsurface Mo vacancy-rich Bi2MoO6 after 3 h of illumination, much higher than that of bulk Bi2MoO6, which gives only 28.6%. Meanwhile, the yield of ethyl pyruvate is 90.2%, which is the highest value in heterogeneous systems using molecular oxygen as oxidant. Moreover, the catalyst is rather stable and can be applied for the selective oxidation of other hydroxyl compounds. This work unveils the role of metal defects engineering in affecting electron&#8211;hole separation, highlighting possible opportunities for highly efficient photocatalytic organic transformation.</description>

      <title>Boosting Artificial Photosynthesis: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Chemisorption and S-Scheme Charge Separation via Anchoring Inorganic QDs on COFs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00026</link>
      <description>Yuehui He, Peiyu Hu, J.C. Zhang, Guijie Liang, Yuanyuan Wang, Fei Xu, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391101394

                Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into valuable hydrocarbon fuels holds great promise in addressing emerging energy shortages and environmental crises while fulfilling pressing societal and national development demands. Nonetheless, its efficiency is hindered by restricted CO2 chemisorption, rapid electron&#8211;hole recombination, and weak redox capability. Drawing inspiration from the distinctive characteristics of Schiff-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs), including substantial specific surface area, unique pore structure, and an abundance of weakly alkaline nitrogen elements, we employ the TPA-COF to enhance the chemisorption and activation of acidic CO2 molecules, as validated by the CO2-temperature-programmed desorption analysis. Furthermore, anchoring CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs) onto the COF facilitates the effective spatial separation of photoinduced charge carriers with strong redox capability, resulting from the formation of S-scheme heterojunctions between the COF and QDs as substantiated by in situ irradiation X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and density functional theory simulations. As anticipated, the optimized COF/QDs heterostructures exhibit remarkable enhancements in CO2 photoreduction performance in the absence of any molecule cocatalyst or scavenger, yielding CO and CH4 at rates of 41.2 and 13.7 &#956;mol g&#8211;1, respectively. This work provides valuable insights into the development of novel organic/inorganic heterojunction photocatalysts with CO2 chemisorption and S-scheme charge separation, offering great potential for sustainable artificial photosynthesis.</description>

                Both noble metals and transition metal oxides are recognized as active centers for alkyne hydrogenation. However, it is still a &#8220;black box&#8221; how the catalytic behavior of oxides evolves upon the catalytic intervention of noble metals. Herein, we report a modularized strategy to track the hydrogenation mechanism of oxides (e.g., TiO2, CeO2, and ZrO2) using a core&#8211;shell micromesoporous zeolite as a structure model, in which the oxide and noble metal (Pt) are functionally separated within a mesopore shell and a micropore core (TS-1 zeolite), respectively. The Pt species are atomically distributed and stabilized by the oxygen atoms of five-membered rings in TS-1 zeolite, which facilitates the heterolytic activation of dihydrogen over Pt&#948;+&#183;&#183;&#183;O2&#8211; units. The active hydrogen species, i.e., H+ and H&#948;&#8722;, migrate to the oxide surface, where the adsorbed reactants are activated for hydrogenation. Mechanistic studies reveal that TiO2, CeO2, and ZrO2 possess efficient hydrogenation properties at near-room temperature with the assistance of spillover hydrogen species, demonstrating dihydrogen dissociation as the main rate-limiting step for pure oxide. Impressively, the adsorbed H2O molecule on TiO2, ZrO2, and CeO2 not only acts as a bridge of hydrogen spillover in reducing the proton diffusion barrier but also forms H3O+ species on the TiO2 (100) surface and endows TiO2 with extraordinary hydrogenation properties. This work opens the &#8220;black box&#8221; for the hydrogenation behavior of transition metal oxides and develops a molecule-assisted strategy for the rational design of hydrogenation catalysts.</description>
