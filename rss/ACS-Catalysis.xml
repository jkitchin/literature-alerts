      <title>Influence of Extra-Framework Aluminum Species on the Catalytic Properties of Acidic USY Zeolite in (Hydro)cracking Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c03269</link>
      <description>Sohrab Askarli, Ildar Mukhambetov, Sang&#8210;Ho Chung, Mohammad Awwad, Jos&#233; Almeida, Sarah Komaty, Juan Carlos Navarro de Miguel, Teng Li, Javier Ruiz&#8208;Mart&#237;nez, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401943162

                Extra-framework aluminum (EFAl) species are known to alter the acidic nature of zeolites and therefore their catalytic properties. Although it has been reported that the formation of such species leads to a change in the concentration and strength of acidity, the influence of those on hydrocracking warrants further exploration. To investigate these concepts, faujasite zeolite (ultrastable Y, USY) samples with various SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were steamed at different conditions until they showed similar hydrocracking activity to the reference USY sample. The steaming process results in zeolite samples with similar catalytic activity and selectivity but different levels of EFAl. Hexane cracking tests and pentylamine adsorption followed by two-dimensional 1H&#8211;27Al heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy show that samples with a high number of EFAl sites have a larger number of those species in close proximity to the Br&#248;nsted acid site (BAS). After the extensive characterization, we concluded that the catalytic activity and product selectivity in hydrocracking is unrelated to both Br&#248;nsted acid strength and EFAl species near BAS, leaving the number of BAS as the main activity descriptor.</description>

      <title>Advanced Progress for Promoting Anodic Hydrogen Oxidation Activity and Anti-CO Poisoning in Fuel Cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c03588</link>
      <description>Bin Cai, Xiaodong Chen, Lei Wang, Honggang Fu, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401945974

                The hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is the anodic reaction of hydrogen&#8211;oxygen fuel cells, which plays a decisive role in the whole-device performance. However, inexpensive crude hydrogen inevitably contains carbon monoxide (CO) impurities, and even the state-of-the-art platinum (Pt) electrocatalysts can suffer an obvious activity decrease due to the poisoning of active sites, seriously hindering the efficiency of fuel cells. Developing electrocatalysts with promoted CO tolerance necessitates the elucidation of the HOR mechanism and deep understanding of the intrinsic nature of fuel cell poisoning. To date, weakening CO adsorption or accelerating its oxidation could improve the CO tolerance of the catalyst, so it is critical to seek much more effective strategies. Based on the study of the reaction mechanism, this Review summarizes the latest progress of HOR electrocatalysts with high stability and high activity against CO poisoning from two typical theories: hydrogen binding energy theory and bifunctional theory. The strategies for enhancing the CO tolerance of catalysts are gathered, including electronic structure modulation, oxophilic sites, and dual-site construction. In addition, the applications of catalysts in practical fuel cells is outlined. In conclusion, the discussion focuses on the challenges and future outlook of CO-tolerant HOR electrocatalysts, with the objective of offering distinct perspectives on the engineering design of HOR electrocatalysts with superior CO tolerance.</description>

      <title>Charge Transfer Drives Hydrogen Adsorption, Spillover, and Hydroxylation at the Pt/&#947;-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Interface</title>

                Metal&#8211;support interactions have garnered much attention due to their impact on the structure and reactivity of supported metal catalysts. Despite the widespread recognition of multifunctional mechanisms in metal/metal oxide systems, much less attention has been paid to how the metal influences its support. Here, we explore metal&#8211;support interactions using hydrogen adsorption on a dehydroxylated &#947;-Al2O3(110) supported Pt10 cluster as a prototype. Through molecular dynamics simulations performed using an actively trained machine-learned force field, we observed reversible hydrogen spillover between the support and the metal. Analysis of the electronic structure and chemical nature of the interface reveals that charge transfer from H to the Pt10 cluster drives the spillover by stabilizing H adsorbed on the support. The same charge transfer concept also explains the stabilization of OH fragments at the Pt10/&#947;-Al2O3(110) interface despite the scarcely impacted or even reduced acidity of interfacial Al sites. These findings demonstrate the rich chemistry of metal&#8211;support interfaces and the importance of "inverse" effects in the fundamental understanding of supported catalysts.</description>

      <title>Formation of Chiral All-Carbon Quaternary Stereocenters by Photoinduced Cobalt-Catalyzed Enantioselective Radical Coupling</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c04249</link>

                Photoinduced enantioselective strategies provide an efficient way to access chiral all-carbon quaternary stereocenters. Compared with the well-developed metal-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate addition of organometallic reagents to enones, the construction of chiral all-carbon quaternary stereocenters through a radical process still remains challenging, especially for the acyclic enones due to their enhanced conformational mobility. Herein, we disclose a photoinduced cobalt-catalyzed asymmetric radical coupling of &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated 2-acyl imidazoles and &#945;-silylamines to give &#946;,&#946;-disubstituted &#947;-amino acid derivatives with acyclic quaternary carbon stereocenters. The facile protocol shows good functional group tolerance and a broad substrate scope. The corresponding chiral products were obtained in generally good yields (up to 96%) with high enantioselectivities (up to 99:1 e.r.).</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Mechanism of Aerobic Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation over Dynamic Structural Renovation on Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Mo, W)</title>

      <description>Xin Huang, Rui Du, Jingyu Ren, Xiang Li, Meng-Xi Fu, Shu-Ping Fu, Taoxia Ma, Li Guo, Razium Ali Soomro, Chunming Yang, Danjun Wang, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401956315

                The aerobic photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (pNRR) is the photocatalytic synthesis of ammonia with air (N2/O2) instead of a high-purity nitrogen source, which can avoid the use of high-cost air separation equipment, thus reducing the production cost of synthetic ammonia. Nevertheless, the mechanism of the effect of oxygen (O2) on the structure and catalytic performance of photocatalysts in the aerobic pNRR is still unclear. Herein, a trace Bi0 loaded Bi2MO6 (M = Mo, W) was ingeniously synthesized by a solvothermal strategy, which demonstrated a superior aerobic pNRR performance. The mechanism of the aerobic pNRR was elucidated by quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ electron spin resonance and density functional theory calculation. The presence of O2 inhibited the formation of excess Bi0 by competing for photogenerated electrons and generating &#183;O2&#8211;, which dynamically renovated the structure of the catalyst. The polarization dipole field induced by an appropriate amount of Bi0 boosted the photocarrier spatial separation/transfer of the aerobic pNRR.</description>

      <title>Cationic Bis(&#951;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;-arene) Cobalt(I) Complexes: Enabling Catalyst Discovery by High-Throughput Experimentation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c03843</link>
      <description>Maya J. Lebowitz, Connor S. MacNeil, Lauren N. Mendelsohn, Michael Shevlin, Matthew V. Pecoraro, Gabriele Hierlmeier, Paul J. Chirik, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401976037

                Cationic, 20-electron bis(&#951;6-arene)Co(I) complexes have been synthesized and evaluated as precursors for the generation of bis(phosphine) cobalt(I) &#951;6-arene precatalysts. The arenes and anions in the precursors were varied, with isolated examples, including [Al(pftb)4]&#8722; (pftb = (CF3)3CO), [BArF4]&#8722; (tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate), and [SbF6]&#8722;. Treatment of the isolated precursors with a series bis(phosphines) resulted in arene displacement and isolation of well-defined [(bis(phosphine))Co(&#951;6-arene)][X] (X = Al(pftb)4&#8211; and SbF6&#8211;; arene = C6H6, C6H5Me, and C6H5Et) complexes in 84&#8211;99% yield. This ligand substitution enabled unprecedented generation of catalyst libraries using high-throughput experimentation (HTE) for asymmetric alkene hydrogenation, as well as formal [2 + 2] cycloaddition, hydroboration, and C(sp2)&#8211;H functionalization. These versatile precursors simplify increasingly complex chemical transformations by introducing single-component, well-defined precatalysts through general ligand substitution.</description>

      <title>Hyper-Cross-Linked Polymer-Based Self-Supported Reusable Ru-NHC Catalyst for Amine-Assisted Hydrogenation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to Methanol</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c02513</link>
      <description>Ravi Kumar, Tanmoy Mandal, Arindom Bhattacherya, Madhusudan K. Pandey, Jitendra K. Bera, Joyanta Choudhury, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401981354

                Research on the capture and catalytic conversion of CO2 to valuable chemicals and alternative fuel candidates has multifaceted relevance from the perspective of sustainable development goals (SDGs). Methanol, advocated as an alternative fuel, can be produced via amine-assisted integrated capture of CO2 and the subsequent hydrogenation via a formamide intermediate. Notably, amines not only function as CO2-capturing agents but also assist in crucial H2 activation by a metal catalyst during a series of hydrogenation steps to form methanol. Toward implementation of this cascade strategy of amine-assisted hydrogenation of CO2 to MeOH, herein, we developed an NHC-based pincer ligand-bound homogeneous molecular Ru catalyst (Ru-1), which was then translated into a porous hyper-cross-linked polymer (HCP)-based self-supported single-site heterogeneous catalyst, termed as HCP-Ru-1. Initially, a control mechanistic investigation was performed in order to get insights into the crucial H2 activation step at the Ru center of the catalyst assisted by the amine used in the reaction. Next, the formation of the formamide intermediate by both catalyst candidates Ru-1 and HCP-Ru-1 was probed and confirmed, employing several amines in the presence of pressurized CO2 and H2 at a relatively mild temperature of 120 &#176;C, where the catalysts exhibited turnover numbers (TONs) up to 3520 and 15,750, respectively, indicating their high catalytic efficiency. Finally, for the catalytic CO2-to-MeOH production reaction, a polyamine, namely, pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA), was used due to its high efficiency in CO2 capture as well as ability to act as a suitable organic base for deprotonative H2 activation, and the Ru-1 and HCP-Ru-1 systems displayed single-run TONs of 400 and 1150, respectively. As the most significant advancement in this process, the heterogeneous HCP-Ru-1 catalyst turned out to be highly reusable, and in a 10-cycle reuse demonstration experiment, it achieved a cumulative TON of 10,370 with merely 1.13% loss in activity per cycle.</description>

      <title>Convergent Active Site Evolution in Platinum Single Atom Catalysts for Acetylene Hydrochlorination and Implications for Toxicity Minimization</title>

                Platinum single atoms anchored onto activated carbon enable highly stable Hg-free synthesis of vinyl chloride (VCM) via acetylene hydrochlorination. Compared to gold-based alternatives, platinum catalysts are in initial phases of development. Most synthetic approaches rely on chloroplatinic acid, presenting opportunities to explore other precursors and their impact on catalyst structure, reactivity, and toxicity aspects. Here, we synthesize platinum single atom catalysts (Pt SACs, 0.2&#8211;0.8 wt % Pt) employing diverse Pt2+ and Pt4+ complexes with ammine, hydroxyl, nitrate, and chloride ligands, following a scalable impregnation protocol on activated carbon extrudates. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that Pt4+ species reduce to Pt2+ upon deposition onto the support. Despite similar oxidation states, the initial activity is precursor dependent, with tetraammine-derived Pt SACs displaying 2-fold higher VCM yield than chlorinated counterparts, linked to superior hydrogen chloride binding abilities by density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Their activity gradually converges due to dynamic active site restructuring, delivering remarkable precursor-independent stability over 150 h. Operando XAS and DFT studies uncover reaction-induced ligand exchange, generating common active and stable Pt&#8211;Clx (x = 2&#8211;3) species. Convergent active site evolution enables flexibility in metal precursor selection and thus toxicity minimization through multiparameter assessment. This study advances safe-by-design catalysts for VCM synthesis, highlighting the importance of toxicity analyses in early-stage catalyst development programs.</description>

      <title>Carbon Dioxide Origin during High-Yield Partial Oxidation of Methane to Protected Methyl Esters</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c04105</link>

                Mn/TiO2 catalysts are highly active for the partial oxidation of methane using dioxygen in acidic media to form oxidation-protected methyl esters. Nonetheless, the formation of carbon dioxide in these systems remains significant. In this study, we used 13C isotope-labeled methane to trace the origin of the carbon dioxide formation. These experiments showed that carbon dioxide primarily stems from acid degradation rather than product overoxidation in this system, confirming the high-yield methane partial oxidation of the esterification approach. Evaluation of activities and selectivities of the catalysts with different initial manganese distributions under different methane partial pressures and reaction temperatures revealed that ester selectivity within the liquid products remains nearly constant, while lower temperatures minimize the parasitic overoxidation of solvent. Using this knowledge, we demonstrated that a Mn/TiO2 catalyst synthesized via coprecipitation can provide 90% ester selectivity at 21% methane conversion within 3 h at 215 &#176;C, representing the best reported heterogeneously catalyzed system for methane partial oxidation with molecular oxygen. This study identifies the road ahead for this chemistry, entailing further optimization of solid catalysts for improved ester productivity and high product yields while curtailing undesired side reactions unrelated to methane conversion.</description>

                Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) over Cu-based catalysts has emerged as a promising strategy for value-added artificial carbon cycling, addressing the current climate and energy challenges. However, the product selectivity and long-term stability of Cu-based catalysts are limited by their instability at constant potential. Recent advancements in pulsed techniques aim to overcome these limitations, enhancing the industrial feasibility of the CO2RR systems. This review critically examines recent research progress in pulsed CO2RR over Cu-based catalysts, offering a comprehensive synthesis of current findings. Key pulse parameters and characterization strategies are explored to uncover the mechanisms behind the enhanced CO2RR performance. The focus is on surface reconstruction, encompassing the regeneration and stabilization of the Cu oxidation states alongside morphological evolution, while also discussing microenvironment changes, including local CO2 concentration, local pH, and ionic arrangement. The intricate modulation mechanisms of pulse mode, potential, and duration on the CO2RR performance are elucidated, highlighting their interconnections. Finally, we identify the prevailing challenges and propose future directions for achieving environmentally friendly and economically viable artificial carbon cycling. By providing insightful perspectives on optimizing pulsed CO2RR, this review paves the way for developing more efficient and robust Cu-based catalytic systems.</description>

                The mechanism of the CO2/C2H4-coupling reaction catalyzed by Ru/dmpe (dmpe = PMe2CH2CH2PMe2) and Ru/PP3 (PP3 = P(CH2CH2PMe2)3) catalysts has been revealed using density functional theory method. Three possible pathways for the catalytic conversion of CO2/C2H4 were proposed, including the formation of acrylic acid, the insertion reaction of ruthenalactone, and the base-assisted formation of acrylate. The resting state was studied by considering the two possible spin states (singlet and triplet) through a principal interacting orbital analysis to anticipate potential competition between low-lying spin states. The higher energy of the triplet compared with the singlet state is due to the interplay between orbital interactions and the coordination mode. Then, the differences in the catalytic mechanism between diphosphine ligands and tetradentate phosphine ligands have been revealed. In the Ru/dmpe system, the size of ruthenalactone can be influenced by the addition of ethylene, resulting in the formation of a homologous series of unsaturated Ru carboxylate products. However, additional ligands cannot bind to the transition metal because the tetra-coordinated PP3-ligated ruthenalactone is saturated with 18 electrons. Meanwhile, the release of the ligand site by dissociation of the Ru&#8211;P bond turned out to be infeasible, because it was a high-energy step. As another possible pathway for catalytic synthesis in the Ru/PP3 system, base-promoted &#946;-H abstraction to produce acrylate salts is found to occur readily. In contrast, the electron-deficient Ru/dmpe system is unlikely to produce acrylate salts due to the methoxide coordinated complexes being too stable. Subsequently, potential enhancements to the Ru-catalyzed acrylate salt formation reaction were identified through an extensive screening of ligands and methoxides. Overall, the coordination sites of the phosphine ligand switch the selectivity of the reaction by influencing the electronic arrangement of the transition metal valence orbitals. The coordination sites and electronic properties of the ligand are important descriptors in determining the fate of the CO2/C2H4 coupling, which provides a valuable perspective for future catalyst design.</description>

      <title>Cobalt-Catalyzed Additive-Free Dehydrogenation of Neat Formic Acid</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c04109</link>
      <description>Bedraj Pandey, Jeanette A. Krause, Hairong Guan, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402079016

                Dehydrogenation of formic acid without using additives and solvents is a challenging research problem in base metal catalysis. In this study, cobalt complexes of the type (iPrPPRP)CoH(PMe3) (iPrPPRP = (o-iPr2PC6H4)2PR; R = H or Me) are shown to catalyze the additive-free dehydrogenation of neat formic acid to carbon dioxide. The iPrPPMeP-ligated cobalt hydride is particularly effective, giving catalytic turnover numbers of up to 7122 with a single load of formic acid and 10,338 with a continuous addition of formic acid. Mechanistic investigation focusing on (iPrPPMeP)CoH(PMe3) reveals that the hydride complex is initially converted to [(iPrPPMeP)CoH2(PMe3)]+ and then to "(iPrPPMeP)Co(OCHO)" as the key intermediates for releasing H2 and CO2, respectively. As the catalytic reaction proceeds, decarbonylation of formic acid produces CO, which transforms the intermediates to [(iPrPPMeP)Co(CO)(PMe3)]+ and (iPrPPMeP)Co(CO)H as the less active forms of the catalyst. Further degradation to [(iPrPPMeP)Co(CO)2]+, protonated phosphine ligands, and cobalt formate ends the catalyst's life. Contrary to many other catalytic systems, the cobalt catalysts described here are more active in neat formic acid than in formic acid solutions, which can be attributed to the removal of PMe3 from the coordination sphere (via phosphine protonation) to generate a more reactive intermediate.</description>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for renewable energy technologies like metal&#8211;air batteries and water splitting. However, it suffers from sluggish kinetics, necessitating a high-activity and stable catalyst. In this study, we used Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to demonstrate that Cr doping favors the phase transition of metal (Fe, Co, Ni) hydroxide to the active phase oxyhydroxide. We synthesized FeCoNiCr hydroxide using an aqueous sol&#8211;gel method, ensuring that the four elements Fe, Co, Ni, and Cr are uniformly distributed at the atomic level. As an OER catalyst, FeCoNiCr hydroxide exhibits a very low overpotential of 224 mV in alkaline media, which is 52 mV lower than that of FeCoNi hydroxide, placing it among the best nonprecious metal catalysts reported so far. Additionally, it demonstrates long-term catalytic stability of 150 h. An assembled Zn-Air battery with FeCoNiCr hydroxides was cycled stably for 160 h with a low discharge/charge voltage difference of 0.70 V. DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling demonstrated that Cr doping significantly optimized the adsorption energies of OER intermediates at the Ni and Co sites, thereby enhancing overall OER activity. Bader charge calculations further revealed that Ni and Co in the catalysts consistently maintained a +3 valence throughout the OER process, which is beneficial for OER catalysis.</description>

                Photocatalytic seawater splitting to produce clean hydrogen from nonpotable water using sunlight is a crucial endeavor. However, the scarcity of high-performance photocatalysts in the promising yet fledgling field presents a formidable challenge. Herein, we successfully synthesized a crystalline oxygen-modified carbon nitride (CCNO) polymeric semiconductor that served as an effective photocatalyst for seawater splitting. Comprehensive characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that nitrogen vacancies and bridging oxygen in the CCNO lattice acted as potent Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs, creating an enhanced built-in electric field. This advancement significantly accelerated charge dynamics and bolstered resistance to ionic interference in seawater. Consequently, CCNO exhibited a robust photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of 29.51 mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 in natural seawater, with an impressive apparent quantum efficiency of 66.86% under 420 nm monochromatic light. Seawater splitting for H2 production reached 16.83 mmol g&#8211;1 under natural light irradiation for 3 h (9&#8211;12 o'clock), showcasing its great potential for practical applications. This work presents strategies for developing a metal-free photocatalyst and elucidates its reaction mechanism in the seawater splitting process, laying the foundation for scalable production of clean hydrogen.</description>
