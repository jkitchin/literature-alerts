      <title>Mechanistic Investigation into Copper(I) Hydride Catalyzed Formic Acid Dehydrogenation</title>

      <description>Roel L. M. Bienenmann, Anne Olarte Loyo, Martin Lutz, Dani&#235;l L. J. Broere, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403171995

                Copper(I) hydride complexes are typically known to react with CO2 to form their corresponding copper formate counterparts. However, recently it has been observed that some multinuclear copper hydrides can feature the opposite reactivity and catalyze the dehydrogenation of formic acid. Here we report the use of a multinuclear PNNP copper hydride complex as an active (pre)catalyst for this reaction. Mechanistic investigations provide insights into the catalyst resting state and the rate-determining step and identify an off-cycle species that is responsible for the unexpected substrate inhibition in this reaction.</description>

      <title>Substrate and Product Selective Supramolecular Catalysis by Pillar[5]arene in the Alkylation of Primary Linear Amines with Allyl Bromide</title>

                We report the supramolecular catalysis exerted by the cavity of pillar[5]arene on the classic nucleophilic substitution reaction of primary alkyl amines on allyl bromide. The tubular nanocatalyst imparts both substrate selectivity for linear amines and product selectivity in favor of secondary amine products. The reaction turned out to be very sensitive to the size of the cavity and the nature of the alkoxy residues on the rim of the cylindrical nanometric catalyst. The acceleration observed was due to the stabilization of the developing charge on the N atom by an electrostatic interaction with the aromatic units of the cavity of the pillararene. Recycling of the supramolecular organocatalyst was also demonstrated.</description>

                Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) provides unique opportunities to mitigate nitrate wastewater pollution and green ammonia production, yet the sluggish kinetics regarding 8e&#8211; transfer and collective activation of multiple reactants and intermediates remain a fundamental challenge. In this study, we present a cooperative catalyst design of atomically dispersed Cu1 species embedding onto reduced anatase TiO2&#8211;x with rich multistage pores and oxygen vacancies (POVs), affording the target POVs-Cu&#948;+-TiO2 with a multisite nature. Particularly, the oxygen vacancies and Cu1 sites in proximity feature a conformational enzyme-mimicking nanopocket, which essentially governs the binding fit of mutative nitrogenate intermediates in the context of synergistic catalysis. The POVs-Cu&#948;+-TiO2 delivers a near-unity Faradaic efficiency (product basis 95.0%) and remarkable ammonia yield rate up to 1321.2 &#956;mol h&#8211;1 mgcat&#8211;1 at &#8722;0.7 V vs RHE. This study underscores the surface topography engineering on reduced metal oxides and the promising synergistic effects over the NO3RR electrocatalysis, providing a better alternative for nitrate wastewater pollution treatment and ammonia production.</description>

      <title>Covalent Organic Framework-Derived B/N Co-Doped Carbon FLPs Metal-Free Catalysts for the Selective Hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;-Unsaturated Aldehydes to Unsaturated Alcohols</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c04537</link>
      <description>Linhao Zhong, Xindi Liao, Haishuai Cui, Jinmei Huang, He&#8217;an Luo, Yang Lv, Pingle Liu, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403299654

                An ongoing challenge is to precisely tailor the frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) sites to construct all-solid-state FLPs metal-free catalysts that are as effective as or even more effective than homogeneous/metal catalysts in H2 activation. In this study, B/N codoped carbon (SNW-BCN) catalysts were prepared by precisely tailoring FLPs sites by targeted doping of B atoms in the nitrogen-rich covalent organic framework (SNW-1) using the ligand-exchange strategy and self-templated carbonization. The catalysts were then applied in the selective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols. It was found that a significant amount of pyridinic-N sites could be obtained from nitrogen-rich SNW-1. Moreover, targeted doping of B atoms can be accomplished by introducing organic ligands (4-formylphenylboronic acid) with Lewis acid heteroatoms to pre-empt the ligand site of SNW-1. Additionally, the B&#8211;N covalent bond, which preferentially forms between B and neighboring N at high temperature, can function as a Lewis acid site. DFT calculations and in situ characterizations show that the neighboring electron-rich pyridinic-N and the electron-deficient B&#8211;N site can form B&#8211;N/pyridinic-N FLPs sites, which can effectively activate H2 and the C&#9552;O of &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes, with only 0.36 eV of H&#8211;H bond dissociation energy. This work encourages the environmentally friendly synthesis of unsaturated alcohols and offers fresh concepts for the development and synthesis of all-solid-state FLPs metal-free catalysts. Additionally, experiments on catalyst scale-up were also investigated because they might shed light on catalyst production on a large scale.</description>

      <title>Active-Site Mutagenesis of Fatty Acid Photodecarboxylase: Experimental and Computational Insight into Substrate Chain-Length Specificity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c02970</link>
      <description>Santiago Nahuel Chanquia, Jan Philipp Bittner, Paul Santner, L&#225;szl&#243; Kriszti&#225;n Szab&#243;, Julie Nielsen, Marcus Lyngdahl &#216;hlenschl&#230;ger, Ahmad Gheis Sarvari, Aske H&#248;j Merrild, Kathrine Gravlund Fo&#823;nss, Daily Jaron, Linnea Ute Lutz, Selin Kara, Bekir Engin Eser, ACS Catalysis.

                Fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP), a microalgal enzyme, is one of the rare photoenzymes found in nature. Since its discovery in 2017, FAP has made a huge impact in the field of photobiocatalysis, being so far the only photoenzyme with potential applicability for organic synthesis. Furthermore, among all studied enzymes to date, FAP is one of the most promising candidates for in vitro feasible biofuel production from oil. One field of study for FAP has been broadening its substrate scope and modulating substrate selectivity. In order to get insight into the enzyme's substrate selectivity, as well as to generate a toolbox of mutant enzymes with distinct substrate preferences toward medium- and long-chain fatty acids, in this work, we carried out extensive mutagenesis of the active-site residues of FAP from Chlorella variabilis (CvFAP). Particularly, we performed partial-site saturation mutagenesis for the Y466 position due to its key location at the active site. Our experimental and computational analysis indicated a correlation between the exchanged amino acid type and the observed activity, demonstrating that the conventional binding mode of long-chain fatty acids is destabilized by charged amino acid residues, leading to a nonproductive binding conformation characterized by a compact folded form. Mutagenesis of other key residues around the substrate binding site led to variants with selectivity toward medium-chain or long-chain fatty acids. For example, we obtained enzyme variants that are highly selective toward either C12:0, C14:0, or C18:0/C18:1 fatty acids. Selectivity patterns agreed very well with the distances between the FAD cofactor and substrate, as calculated by our molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, we report unexplored activity of the wild-type CvFAP toward C20:1 and C22:1 fatty acids, which are major components of jojoba oil and rapeseed oil, respectively.</description>
