      <title>Selective &#945;-Hydroxyketone Formation and Subsequent C&#8211;C Bond Cleavage by Cytochrome P450 Monooxygenase Enzymes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01766</link>
      <description>Joel H. Z. Lee, Tom Coleman, Mark A. McLean, Matthew N. Podgorski, Eva F. Hayball, Isobella S. J. Stone, John B. Bruning, Fiona Whelan, James J. De Voss, Stephen G. Sligar, Stephen Bell, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399086392

                The heme enzymes of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (CYPs) catalyze oxidation reactions with a high level of selectivity. Here, the CYP199A4 enzyme from the bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris HaA2 is used to catalyze the hydroxylation of carbonyl-containing compounds to generate &#945;-hydroxyketones. Both 4-propionyl- and 4-(2-oxopropyl)-benzoic acids were regioselectively hydroxylated by this enzyme to generate &#945;-hydroxyketone metabolites, 4-(2-hydroxypropanoyl)benzoic acid and 4-(1-hydroxy-2-oxopropyl)benzoic acid, respectively, with high stereoselectivity. Co-crystallization of CYP199A4 with each substrate allowed high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the enzyme bound with both to be determined. These provide a rationale for biochemical observations related to substrate binding and activity. As these versatile enzymes have a demonstrated ability to support carbon&#8211;carbon (C&#8211;C) bond cleavage (lyase) reactions on &#945;-hydroxyketones, we assessed if this activity would be catalyzed by wild-type (WT) CYP199A4. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations predicted the regioselective hydroxylation of each substrate but indicated that the WT enzyme would not be a good catalyst for lyase activity, in agreement with the experimental observations. The MD simulations also suggested the F182L mutant of CYP199A4 would permit closer approach of the substrate to the ferric-peroxo intermediate, enabling the formation of the lyase transition state. Indeed, this variant was observed to catalyze the cleavage reaction. Furthermore, the F182A variant of CYP199A4 was used to catalyze both the hydroxylation and C&#8211;C bond cleavage reactions with both 4-propionyl- and 4-(2-oxopropyl)-benzoic acids using hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. This dual CYP activity is analogous to that supported by the mammalian CYP17A1 enzyme in steroid biosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Chemo- and Regioselective Nickel-Catalyzed Reductive 1,4-Alkylarylation of 1,3-Enynes through an L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NiAr Intermediate</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01189</link>

                Three-component reductive dicarbofunctionalization reactions of 1,3-enynes have been rarely reported because of the intricate control of chemo- and regioselectivity required, coupled with a limited understanding of radical and catalytic species involved. Herein, we report a nickel-catalyzed reductive 1,4-alkylarylation method for 1,3-enynes to yield tri- and tetrasubstituted allenes using readily accessible alkyl and aryl iodides, featuring a simple operational protocol and mild reaction conditions. In our mechanistic studies, the formation of a propargyl/allenyl radical was substantiated by the isolation of a propargyl dimer, the detection of the corresponding TEMPO&#8211;radical adduct, and radical probe experiments. Two reduced L2NiAr complexes, expected to act as catalytic intermediates, were generated and characterized by EPR spectroscopy as NiI complexes. The stoichiometric reaction of L2Ni(p-NCC6H4) with 1,3-enyne and alkyl iodide showed conversion into the corresponding propargyl dimer and allene, suggesting that the reaction encompasses the same key mechanistic steps as the catalytic reaction, i.e., activation of alkyl iodide, generation of a propargyl/allenyl radical, and selective coupling of this radical with the aryl component.</description>

                Hydrogen-atom transfer (HAT) is crucial for selective photocatalytic water splitting. We report a class of metal chalcogenide catalysts (CdxZn1&#8211;xS(OH)-SH) that feature mercapto groups (acid sites) and lattice oxygens/hydroxyls (base sites) to form acid&#8211;base pairs. Based on this structural design, we demonstrate lattice oxygen/hydroxyl activation and an HAT process under light irradiation and identify a rapid hydrogen-transfer pathway governed by the Grotthuss mechanism. The photocatalyst Cd0.5Zn0.5S(OH)-SH exhibited a rate of 205.8 mmol&#183;g&#8211;1&#183;h&#8211;1 under full-spectrum illumination and an apparent quantum efficiency of 12.4% at 420 nm without any cocatalyst. Based on the HAT process, this novel catalyst achieves a proton&#8211;deuteron separation factor of approximately 11. The energy consumption is projected to be orders of magnitude lower than that of existing technologies. The fabricated large-scale nanocomposites of these photocatalysts are expected to enable large-scale separation of substantial volumes of diluted tritium wastewater.</description>

      <title>Linking Bulk and Surface Structures in Complex Mixed Oxides</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05230</link>

                The interface between a solid catalyst and the reacting medium plays a crucial role in the function of the material in catalysis. In the present work, we show that the surface termination of isostructural molybdenum&#8211;vanadium oxides is strongly linked to the real structure of the bulk. This conclusion is based on comparing (scanning) transmission electron microscopy images with pair distribution function (PDF) data obtained for (Mo,V)Ox and (Mo,V,Te,Nb)Ox. Distance-dependent analyses of the PDF results demonstrate that (Mo,V,Te,Nb)Ox exhibits stronger deviations from the averaged orthorhombic crystal structure than (Mo,V)Ox in the short and intermediate regimes. These deviations are explained by higher structural diversity, which is facilitated by the increased chemical complexity of the quinary oxide and in particular by the presence of Nb. This structural diversity is seemingly important to form intrinsic bulk-like surface terminations that are highly selective in alkane oxidation. More rigid (Mo,V)Ox is characterized by defective surfaces that are more active but less selective for the same reactions. In line with machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) calculations, we highlight that the surface termination of (Mo,V,Te,Nb)Ox is characterized by a reconfiguration of the pentagonal building blocks, causing a preferential exposure of Nb sites. The presented results foster hypotheses that chemical complexity is superior for the performance of multifunctional catalysts. The underlying principle is not the presence of multiple chemically different surface centers but instead the ability of structural diversity to optimally align and distribute the elements at the surface and, thus, to shape the structural environment around the active sites. This study experimentally evidences the origin of the structure-directing impact of the real structure of the bulk on functional interfaces and encourages the development of efficient surface engineering strategies toward improved high-performance selective oxidation catalysts.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Reaction Network for Dimethyl Maleate Hydrogenation on the Active Sites of Cu/ZnO Catalysts Combining DFT with kMC Analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01057</link>
      <description>Changdong Li, Weiwei Zhang, Haipeng Yu, Yingzhe Yu, Minhua Zhang, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399140883

                The Cu/zinc oxide (ZnO)/Al2O3 catalyst is highly favored in the hydrogenation of dimethyl maleate (HDMM) to coproduction of 1,4-butanediol (BDO), &#947;-butyrolactone (GBL), and tetrahydrofuran, and an in-depth study on its catalytic principle has a long-standing interest in the current study. Herein, by combining density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we revealed the dominant pathways and reaction network of the HDMM process on the ZnO/Cu(111) surface. The effect of Cu&#8211;ZnO synergy is reflected in promoting the anchoring of ester carbonyls and decreasing the difficulty of hydroxyl group formation, which was clarified by mechanisms, density of states, and Bader charge analyses. From the perspective of constructive modification of active sites, a strategy was proposed to improve the GBL formation rate by decreasing the barrier of methanol removal based on the concepts of degree of rate control, and the BDO selectivity could be improved by increasing the barrier of the out-of-ring C&#8211;O bond cleavage in GBL hydrogenation. From the perspective of the external environment, the optimal reaction conditions of different target products were determined by manipulating the temperature and pressure. This study provides a guide for modifying active sites in Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts and potential possibilities for studying the complex reaction systems involving C4+ substances by multiscale simulation.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of Photoredox Catalysis Featuring Nickel&#8211;Bipyridine Complexes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c02036</link>

                Metallaphotoredox catalysis can unlock useful pathways for transforming organic reactants into desirable products, largely due to the conversion of photon energy into chemical potential to drive redox and bond transformation processes. Despite the importance of these processes for cross-coupling reactions and other transformations, their mechanistic details are only superficially understood. In this review, we have provided a detailed summary of various photoredox mechanisms that have been proposed to date for Ni&#8211;bipyridine (bpy) complexes, focusing separately on photosensitized and direct excitation reaction processes. By highlighting multiple bond transformation pathways and key findings, we depict how photoredox reaction mechanisms, which ultimately define substrate scope, are themselves defined by the ground- and excited-state geometric and electronic structures of key Ni-based intermediates. We further identify knowledge gaps to motivate future mechanistic studies and the development of synergistic research approaches spanning the physical, organic, and inorganic chemistry communities.</description>

      <title>Unnatural Thiamine Radical Enzymes for Photobiocatalytic Asymmetric Alkylation of Benzaldehydes and &#945;-Ketoacids</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c02752</link>
      <description>Xin Liu, Shuai Xu, Heyu Chen, Yang Yang, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399155612

                Despite substantial progress made toward elucidating the natural radical enzymology with thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductases (PFORs) and pyruvate oxidases (POXs), repurposing naturally occurring two-electron TPP-dependent enzymes to catalyze single-electron transformations with significant synthetic value remains a daunting task. Enabled by the synergistic use of visible-light photocatalyst fluorescein and a set of engineered TPP-dependent enzymes derived from benzoylformate decarboxylase (BFD) and benzaldehyde lyase (BAL), we developed an asymmetric photobiocatalytic decarboxylative alkylation of benzaldehydes and &#945;-keto acids to produce highly enantioenriched &#945;-branched ketones. Mechanistically, we propose that this dual catalytic radical alkylation involves single-electron oxidation of the enzyme-bound Breslow intermediate and subsequent interception of the photoredox-generated transient alkyl radical. In conjunction with visible light photoredox catalysis, thiamine radical biocatalysis represents an emerging platform to discover and optimize asymmetric radical transformations that are unknown to biological systems and not amenable to small-molecule catalysis.</description>

      <title>Pd/Cu Cooperative Catalysis for Heteroarylation of Vinyl C&#8211;H Bond-Forming Polyaryl Ethylenes via C&#8211;O/Dual C&#8211;H Cleavage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c02195</link>
      <description>Qihang Tan, Chenglong Li, Lei Yang, Zirun Wang, Yuxuan Huang, C. Wang, Long Liu, Wenhao Chen, Tieqiao Chen, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399167230

                Polyaryl ethylenes find wide applications in synthetic, medicinal, and material fields; however, their stereo-selective synthesis is very challenging. In this paper, we describe a highly efficient bimetallic cooperative catalysis consisting of a palladium catalyst and a copper catalyst. This catalytic system enables the stereo-selective installation of a heteroaryl group onto the double bond of ortho-vinyl phenoxides via C&#8211;O cleavage and dual C&#8211;H activation. Extensive mechanistic studies show that copper-catalyzed C&#8211;H cleavage of heteroarenes is the rate-determining step. It can facilitate the formation of the key intermediate palladium cycle along with the ionic properties of arylpalladium species generated through oxidative addition, thus promoting the shift of Pd from the aryl to the vinyl group and ensuring the success of this reaction. This reaction overcomes the substrate limitation of previous aryl halide-based palladium shift systems well and provides an efficient method for preparing polyaryl ethylenes with high stereo-selectivity and a wide substrate scope. cis-Diaryl ethylenes, trans-diaryl ethylenes, triaryl ethylenes, and tetraaryl ethylenes all can be produced stereo-selectively. Considering the unique chemical and physical properties of poly-substituted ethylenes, especially the strong AIE effect, we anticipate that this powerful synthetic strategy will find wide applications in synthetic and material communities.</description>

      <title>Direct Methanol Fuel Cell with Porous Carbon-Supported PtRu Single-Atom Catalysts for Coproduction of Electricity and Value-Added Formate</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c02016</link>

                Bottlenecks in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) with conventional noble metals as anode catalysts involve the formation of valueless byproducts and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Carbon-supported Pt single atoms have demonstrated high performance in DMFCs. However, the adsorbed intermediates (COads) strongly bind to Pt single-atom sites, resulting in complete methanol oxidation to CO2 and low power densities. Herein, we have developed a DMFC for CO2-emission-free coproduction of electricity and valuable formate using metal organic framework (MOF)-derived N-doped porous carbon-supported PtRu single-atom (referred to as PtRuSA/NPC) catalysts. The DMFC produces current and power densities of 657 mA cm&#8211;2 and 97.4 mW cm&#8211;2, respectively, at a potential of 0.65 V with a 98.4% Faraday efficiency for formate at 80 &#176;C. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that CH3OH molecules preferentially adsorb onto the PtRu single atoms, but their oxidation to CO2 molecules on PtRuSA/NPC is kinetically unfavorable due to the large energy barrier. This study offers a pathway to developing high-performance and CO2-emission-free electrocatalysts for DMFCs.</description>

                Ni can be used as a catalyst for dry reforming of methane (DRM), replacing more expensive and less abundant noble metal catalysts (Pt, Pd, and Rh) with little sacrifice in activity. Ni catalysts deactivate quickly under realistic DRM conditions. Rare earth oxides such as CeO2, or as CeO2&#8211;ZrO2&#8211;Al2O3 (CZA), are supports that improve both the activity and stability of Ni DRM systems due to their redox activity. However, redox-active supports can also enhance the undesired reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, reducing the hydrogen selectivity. In this work, Ni on CZA was coated with an ultrathin Al2O3 overlayer using atomic layer deposition (ALD) to study the effects of the overlayer on catalyst activity, stability, and H2/CO ratio. A low-conversion screening method revealed improved DRM activity and lower coking rate upon the addition of the Al2O3 ALD overcoat, and improvements were subsequently confirmed in a high-conversion reactor at long times onstream. The overcoated samples gave an H2/CO ratio of &#8764;1 at high conversion, much greater than uncoated catalysts, and no evidence of deactivation. Characterization of used (but still active) catalysts using several techniques suggests that active Ni is in formal oxidation state &gt;0, Ni&#8211;Ce&#8211;Al is most likely present as a mixed oxide at the surface, and a nominal thickness of 0.5 nm for the Al2O3 overcoat is optimal.</description>

      <title>Interstitial Zinc Defects Enriched ZnO Tuning O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Adsorption and Conversion Pathway for Superior Photocatalytic CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Oxygenation</title>

                Photocatalytic methane conversion into liquid oxygenates using O2 oxidants provides a promising approach for high-value chemicals. The generation of reactive oxygen species and their reaction pathway are key to determine the oxygenate selectivity. Here, an interstitial Zni defect ZnO (ZnO(Zni)) is developed through thermal decomposition of the ZnO2 precursor. Zni favors the O2 adsorption at a terminal adsorption configuration and induces effectively the conversion O2 into the desired &#8226;OOH instead of &#8226;OH for improving the yield and selectivity of oxygenates. For comparison, O2 adsorbed in a lateral configuration tends to be converted into excessive &#8226;OH on the typical Au/ZnO. As a result, ZnO(Zni) shows the liquid oxygenates yield of 6080 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 with 98.6% selectivity, which leads to 10 times lower than Au/ZnO for CO2 release of overoxidation. This work provides a pathway for O2 adsorption and activation to regulate the photocatalytic CH4 oxidation conversion into liquid oxygenates.</description>

      <title>Ethylene Polymerization over Metal&#8211;Organic Framework-Supported Zirconocene Complexes</title>

                Metallocene immobilization onto a solid support helps to overcome the drawbacks of homogeneous metallocene complexes in the catalytic olefin polymerization. In this study, valuable insights have been obtained into the effects of pore size, linker composition, and surface groups of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) on their role as support materials for metallocene-based ethylene polymerization catalysis. Three distinct Zn-based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), namely, MOF-5, IRMOF-3, and ZIF-8, with different linkers have been activated with methylaluminoxane (MAO) and zirconocene complexes, followed by materials characterization and testing for ethylene polymerization. Characterization has been performed by multiple analytical tools, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and CO Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. It was found that the interactions between MOFs, MAO, and the zirconocene complex not only lead to both catalyst activation and deactivation but also result in the creation of multiple active sites. By alteration of the MOF support, it is possible to obtain polyethylene with different properties. Notably, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE, MW = 5.34 &#215; 106) was obtained using IRMOF-3 as support. This study reveals the potential of MOF materials as tunable porous supports for metallocene catalysts active in ethylene polymerization.</description>
