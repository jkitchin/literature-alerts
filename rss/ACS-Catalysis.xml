                The catalytic asymmetric transformation of nitrogen atoms to prepare heterocyclic molecules is of significant value in organic synthesis and biological applications. Here, we disclose the activation of the nitrogen atom in hydrazine-derived hydrazone via an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organic catalyst for highly enantioselective formal cycloaddition reactions. The range of NHC catalysis extends across several (carbon and hetero) atoms and diverse chemical bonds (C&#9552;N and N&#8211;N bonds) to activate nitrogen atoms at remote sites with excellent reactivity and (stereo)selectivity control. Our strategy for nitrogen atom activation, along with the NHC-bound diaza-diene intermediate generated during the catalytic process, offers alternative solutions for organic synthesis.</description>

ACS Publications&#169; 2024 American Chemical SocietyIt has come to our attention that the kinetic parameters were erroneously calculated during the change of their units from the data presented in the Supporting Information to the main article. While the Supporting Information correctly represented the kinetic parameters (Figure S76 and Figure S77), the units (KM in mM, kcat in min&#8211;1, and kcat /KM in min&#8211;1 mM&#8211;1) are different from those in the main article (Table 1, Page 12626). The corrected Table 1 and its corresponding description (Kinetic Studies, Page 12629) (corrections are in bold) as well as the corrected sections of the Supporting Information (Figure S76 and Figure S77) are provided with this Correction. It is important to note that these modified parameters do not impact any of the conclusions drawn in the original article.In addition, we erroneously typed T14 to represent the Y14 in Figure S85A and Figure S86A of the Supporting Information. The corrected figures are provided in the Supporting Information with this Correction.Kinetic StudiesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!In order to gain insights of kinetics information about the DHR, both the variants, Y14C and Y14A, along with the wild-type enzyme were taken for evaluation. The steady-state kinetic parameters of Y14C toward the synthesis of (1R,2S)-1a were determined by measuring the initial velocities against different concentrations of 1. In comparison to the wild-type, Y14C exhibited &gt;88-fold improved kcat, and &#8764;3-fold reduced KM (Table 1, Figure S77A,B). The single variant elicited a remarkable increase in catalytic efficiency of &gt;250-fold than the wild-type, as kcat/KM of Y14C and the wild-type were found to be 5.01 and 0.02 s&#8211;1 M&#8211;1, respectively. The kinetic parameters for Y14A toward (1R,2S)-9b were kcat = 0.06 s&#8211;1, KM = 40.2 mM (Table 1, Figure S77C). Selection of 9 for this study was based on the highest catalytic activity and stereoselectivity of Y14A achieved during asymmetric addition of 1-nitropropane to this substrate (Figure 4). Unfortunately, the kinetic data of the wild-type was not possible to measure toward the synthesis of 9b due to its extremely low activity. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of Y14A was found to be 1.49 s&#8211;1 M&#8211;1. Even though it is unfair to compare, the catalytic efficiency of Y14A toward (1R,2S)-9b, which is assumed to be highest among the molecules of Figure 4, appeared to be &#8764;3.5-fold less than the catalytic efficiency of Y14C toward the synthesis of 1a. The former case has demonstrated a &#8764;2-fold reduced kcat along with increased KM compared with data for the latter. This explains the overall reduced biocatalytic conversion to 1-nitropropane based &#946;-nitroalcohols as compared to nitroethane based &#946;-nitroalcohols. Due to lack of similar data the kinetics parameters could not be compared with other HNLs. However, the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of Y14C catalyzed synthesis of 1a is &gt;580-fold and Y14A catalyzed synthesis of 9b is &gt;720-fold lower than the catalytic efficiency of one of the best AtHNL variants (F179N) toward nitromethane addition to 1 or 9.70 This suggests that stereoselective addition of longer nitroalkanes remains a challenge despite the use of the same aldehyde, 1 in the asymmetric Henry reaction.Table 1.

      <title>Controlling Cubic versus Octahedral Morphology in Plasmonic Aluminum Nanoparticle Synthesis with Titanocene Catalysts: A Systematic Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c06286</link>
      <description>Jae&#8208;Kwan Kim, Christian R. Jacobson, Naomi J. Halas, Ian A. Tonks, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404913495

                Ti precatalysts containing the titanocene moiety (Cp2Ti&#8211;, Cp = cyclopentadienyl) can, under certain conditions, selectively produce cubic Al nanocrystals through the dehydrocoupling of alane amine adducts such as AlH3&#183;NMe2Et. A systematic study of reaction conditions reveals that cubic Al nanoparticle formation occurs at a higher temperature (e.g., 65 &#176;C) and/or higher catalyst-concentration conditions (e.g., 0.5 mol % [Ti]). Kinetic studies reveal that under these conditions nanoparticle formation and alane consumption are much faster, and cubic nanoparticle formation takes place under kinetically controlled conditions. On the other hand, employing a wide suite of TiX4 (X = anionic ligand)-type precatalysts yielded only octahedral-shaped aluminum nanoparticles regardless of conditions. Finally, we report the synthesis of a hydride-bridged Ti&#8211;Al heterobimetallic compound from the reaction of Cp2TiCl2 with AlH3&#183;NMe2Et and characterized it to show that it is a reaction intermediate in the Ti-catalyzed aluminum nanoparticle synthesis.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Coordination Environment of Cu Single Atoms for Achieving Regioselective C&#8211;C Bond Activation of Amides</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c05223</link>
      <description>Wunengerile Zhang, Chaolumen Bai, Dan Liu, Agula Bao, Tegshi Muschin, Yong&#8208;Sheng Bao, Jin Xie, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404917578

                C&#8211;C bond activation can provide a direct reconstruction strategy of carbon skeletons to furnish a number of structurally diverse molecules. In general, regioselectivity represents the state-of-the-art owing to the existence of several different carbon&#8211;carbon bonds, having a high BDE, &#8764;90 kcal/mol. Here, we report a directed strategy for amides for the concise synthesis of a range of urea derivatives and carbamates via regioselective C&#8211;C bond activation enabled by the heterogeneous single-atom copper catalyst (Cu-SAC), with a turnover frequency of 249 h&#8211;1, which is 19 times higher than that of the analogous homogeneous copper catalyst. Multitechnique characterization data show that single-atom Cu species are associated with an unsaturated coordination structure and plentiful oxygen vacancies on &#947;-Al2O3 that facilitate the adsorption of multiple coordinated amides and dioxygen, leading to high catalytic activity and selectivity. It would offer opportunities to speed up the heterogenized process of homogeneous catalysts in regioselective inert-bond activation reactions.</description>

                A Ru(II)-catalyzed straightforward and efficient strategy has been developed to construct O-alkylated arylnaphthyl thioether derivatives using arylthioacetates/arylalkylthioethers with diazonaphthoquinone via a [1,4]-oxa sigmatropic rearrangement. In a complementary method, heteroaryl thioacetate/heteroaryl alkylthioethers offer O-heteroaryl alkylnaphthyl thioether derivatives via an interesting concerted intramolecular SNAr-type reaction. Both of these methods proceed through the formation of Ru-based quinoid carbene and sulfur ylide, respectively. A detailed mechanistic study and DFT calculations reveal that the reaction is going via a concerted manner. Postsynthetic modifications of the synthesized compounds led to sulfur-containing polyaromatic heterocycles.</description>

      <title>Photocatalytic Carboxylation of Terminal Alkynes with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over Metal&#8211;Porphyrin Framework Nanosheets</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c06006</link>

                To develop an environmentally benign and efficient route for converting CO2 into value-added chemicals is of great importance. Here, we demonstrate the photocatalytic carboxylation of terminal alkynes with CO2 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, by copper-based porphyrinic framework photocatalysts Cu2TCPP(M) (TCPP = 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin; M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu). The Cu2TCPP(Cu) nanosheets (with a small thickness of &#8764;5.1 nm) exhibit an extremely high performance for the reaction of 1-ethynylbenzene with CO2 to produce 3-phenylpropiolic acid. The turnover frequency is up to 3.33 mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 at 10 h, which is much higher than those of the photothermally and thermally driven routes that are usually adopted for the carboxylation reactions catalyzed by metal&#8211;organic frameworks. The mechanism for the superior activity of Cu2TCPP(Cu) nanosheets was investigated by a series of experiments and theoretical calculations. It is revealed that the Cu2TCPP(Cu) nanosheets not only possess good photoelectronic properties but have desired molecular structure for boosting CO2 activation, alkyne activation, and carboxylation reactions.</description>

      <title>Disrupted Spin Degeneracy Promoted C&#8801;C Triple Bond Activation for Efficient Electrochemical Acetylene Semihydrogenation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c06191</link>
      <description>Menglei Yuan, Hongyu Jiang, Ruyi Jiang, Zhao Wang, Zhihao Zhao, Bao&#8208;Lian Su, Jian Zhang, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404924221

                Disrupting the spin degeneracy of the electrocatalyst and further manipulating the related orbital electron arrangement are highly desirable for activating acetylene molecules. Herein, a squarate cobalt-based metal&#8211;organic framework (Co-MOF) ([Co3(C4O4)2(OH)2]&#183;3H2O) is post-treated to accelerate the evolution from CoO6 octahedron to CoO5 pentahedron and further utilized for the electrochemical acetylene semihydrogenation reaction. Comprehensive analyses corroborate that the disrupted spin degeneracy of active sites originated from the breakage of the Co&#8211;O bond, which promotes the cleavage of the orbital energy level and the rearrangement of the d-orbital electron. The newly emerged half-occupied dx2&#8211;y2 orbitals and empty dz2 orbitals in CoO5 pentahedron concerted interplay with the bonding and antibonding orbitals of acetylene, which reduces the adsorption energy of acetylene and facilitates the activation of the inert C&#8801;C triple bond. Thus, the defective Co-MOF exhibits the superior ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 96% and partial current density of 128 mA cm&#8211;2 at &#8722;1.0 V vs RHE compared to that of pristine Co-MOF (FEC2H4: 60%; JC2H4: 66 mA cm&#8211;2). This work delivers inspiration for spin-state regulation of active sites and sparks renewed interest in designing highly efficient electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence-Driven Development of Nickel-Catalyzed Enantioselective Cross-Coupling Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c04277</link>
      <description>Yadong Gao, Kunjun Hu, Jianhang Rao, Qiang Zhu, Kuangbiao Liao, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404941646

                The conventional approach to developing asymmetric synthetic methods relies heavily on empirical optimization. However, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and high-throughput experimentation (HTE) technology presents a paradigm shift with immense potential to revolutionize the discovery and optimization of asymmetric reactions. In this study, we present an efficient workflow for the development of a series of nickel-catalyzed asymmetric cross-coupling reactions, leveraging AI and HTE technology. Many nickel-catalyzed enantioselective cross-coupling reactions share a common Ni(III) intermediate, which dictates the enantioselectivity. To harness this mechanistic insight, we embarked on developing a predictive model for nickel-catalyzed enantioselective coupling reactions, elucidating the general rules governing enantioselectivity. Through the application of data science tools and HTE technology, we curated a data set to construct an AI-based model. This model was subsequently utilized to facilitate the discovery of efficient nickel hydride-catalyzed enantioselective and regioselective cross-coupling reactions. Employing AI-assisted virtual ligand screening and HTE-enabled condition optimization, we successfully identified optimal ligands for eight coupling reactions. Consequently, a series of chiral sp3 C&#8211;C bonds were synthesized with high yield and enantioselectivity.</description>

      <title>Electronic Interactions between Anchored Molecular Catalyst and Support</title>

                Immobilizing molecular catalysts on surfaces introduces spatial control of catalysis and promises improved stability and recyclability of the catalyst. The interplays between the support and the immobilized molecular species, however, remain underexplored. Using Ni as a prototypical support, here we report a study on how the electronic interactions between the support and the molecular catalyst impacts the reactivity. This work was built upon our previous successes in switching the reactivity of iron bis(iminopyridine) alkoxide complexes through redox toggling, where the anchored iron(II) complex polymerizes lactide, and its cationic iron(III) counterpart polymerizes epoxides. It was found that Ni as a metal support could readily oxidize the complex to exhibit catalytic activity toward epoxide polymerization. The charge transfer between Ni and the Fe complex could be modulated by either electrochemical reduction or adding a layer of TiO2. The results are expected to have major implications for research efforts aimed at converging homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.</description>

      <title>Automated Exploration of Heterogeneous Catalysis with a Gas&#8211;Solid Nanoreactor</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c06026</link>
      <description>Jiawei Bai, Xingchen Liu, Tingyu Lei, Yuwei Zhou, Wenping Guo, Dennis R. Salahub, Xiaodong Wen, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405055249

                We present an automated method, gas&#8211;solid nanoreactor molecular dynamics (GS-NMD), designed to explore reaction space and construct reaction networks for complex gas&#8211;solid heterogeneous catalysis systems by integrating multiple acceleration techniques. Periodic pulses were used to drive gas-phase molecules toward the catalyst surface, accelerating adsorption and Eley&#8211;Rideal reactions. Adsorbed species were then subjected to metadynamics to overcome reaction barriers associated with migration, Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood-type reactions, and desorption, using the root-mean-square deviations in Cartesian space as collective variables. We demonstrate the efficiency of GS-NMD with the case of N2 dissociation on Fe surfaces, showing its ability to effectively screen for low-barrier reactions within a vast reaction space and distinct catalysts of different performances. Additionally, we illustrate the method's utility in constructing effective reaction networks for heterogeneous catalysis, exemplified by ammonia synthesis, which comprises only low-barrier elementary steps. These results suggest that GS-NMD is a promising and efficient tool for the automated exploration of heterogeneous catalysis, enabling the identification of the most favorable mechanisms and active sites for gas&#8211;solid reactions.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Photocatalytic Divergent Decarbonylative Silylation with Cinnamaldehyde via a [Ru(dcbpy)(bpy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-Incorporated UiO-67 Framework</title>

                We herein develop an innovative approach for the decarbonylative silylation using a molecular [Ru(dcbpy)(bpy)2]2+ (dcbpy = 2,2&#8242;-bipyridyl-5,5&#8242;-dicarboxylic acid; bpy = 2,2&#8242;-bipyridine) incorporated UiO-67 metal&#8211;organic framework (MOFs) (denoted as UiO-67-Ru) as a powerful heterogeneous catalyst, which is then applied in the reaction of abundantly available cinnamaldehydes with silanes under photothermal condition. Mechanistic studies reveal that the silane can be absorbed and activated within the cavities of the framework, leading to the generation of a silyl radical. The silyl radical plays a key role in the decarbonylative silylation process and further goes through oxidative silylation with cinnamaldehydes to generate the corresponding alkenyl silanes. This work not only develops a strategy for the preparation of alkenyl silane from highly abundant cinnamaldehyde and silanes but also affords useful inspiration on the rational design of MOFs materials for the decarbonylative silylation.</description>

      <title>Shallow Rate-Redox Potential Scaling in Aqueous Molecular Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis Across a Family of Iron Macrocycles</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c06561</link>
      <description>Travis Marshall-Roth, Liang Liu, Vennela Mannava, Deiaa M. Harraz, Brian J. Cook, R. Morris Bullock, Yogesh Surendranath, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405089233

                Rate-overpotential scaling relationships have been employed widely to understand trends in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis by dissolved metal macrocycles in organic electrolytes. Similar scaling relationships remain unknown for surface-adsorbed ORR electrocatalysts in the acidic aqueous environments germane to proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Herein, we examine ORR catalysis in aqueous perchloric acid media for a structurally diverse array of iron macrocycle complexes adsorbed on Vulcan carbon black. The macrocycles encompass Fe&#8211;N4, Fe&#8211;N2N&#8242;2 and Fe&#8211;NxC4&#8211;x motifs bearing pyrrolic, pyridinic, and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) moieties in the primary ligation sphere, giving rise to a 670 mV range in Fe(III/II) redox potentials, EFe(III/II). Experimental Tafel data in the micropolarization regime were extrapolated to the EFe(III/II) to furnish estimated per-site-normalized current density (jper-site) values that span &#8764;4.6 orders of magnitude across the family of compounds. Despite the structural diversity of this family of compounds, extrapolated jper-site values correlate with the Fe(III/II) redox potentials in a roughly log-linear fashion with a shallow scaling factor of approximately 145 mV/decade. These findings highlight the phenomenology that negative shifts in EFe(III/II) track with diminishing returns in catalytic rate promotion, regardless of the exact ORR mechanism, and suggest that changes to the primary ligating environment in a macrocycle are insufficient to break fundamental rate-potential scaling relationships in aqueous ORR catalysis. Together these studies motivate the further development of higher-potential iron complexes that employ motifs beyond the equatorial ligation plane to enhance ORR catalysis.</description>
