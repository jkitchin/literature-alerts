      <title>Enzymatic Fluoroethylation by a Fluoroethyl Selenium Analogue of S-Adenosylmethionine</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01112</link>

                Fluorine is a unique element with important roles in medicinal chemistry, agrochemistry, and materials chemistry. The fluoroethyl group is an important fluoroalkyl functional unit that is widely used in clinical drugs, 19F probes and 18F PET diagnostic drugs. Chemo- and regioselective fluoroethylation is difficult in chemical synthesis. To date, no enzymatic reaction for selective fluoroethylation has been reported. Based on the widespread natural methyl donor S-adenosine-l-methionine (SAM), we designed and synthesized a fluoroethyl SAM analogue (FEt-SAM). A stability study revealed that FEt-SAM was very labile under physiological conditions and gave the fluorine-elimination product vinyl-SAM. We circumvented this problem by replacing the S in FEt-SAM with Se to give fluoroethyl Se-adenosyl-l-selenomethionine (FEt-SeAM). By using halide methyltransferase (HMT) and its mutant for the in situ production of FEt-SeAM, we created cascade reactions of the HMT mutant with methyltransferases and fluoroethylated several O-, N-, S-, and C-nucleophiles. For methyltransferases that did not recognize FEt-SeAM well, such as DnrK and NovO, simple mutagenesis of the conserved hydrophobic residues (Leu and Ile) in the SAM binding pocket to smaller amino acids significantly increased the activities. Therefore, we have provided a useful tool for the late-stage fluoroethylation of natural products and drugs. This method could also be used to enzymatically prepare probes for 19F NMR and 18F PET tests.</description>

      <title>Self-Reconstruction of Core&#8211;Shell Structured Electrocatalysts for Tailoring Reaction Pathways Revealed by Electrochemical Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00269</link>
      <description>Zhixuan Lu, Yajun Huang, Ningyu Chen, Chuan Liu, Xiang Wang, Bin Ren, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394605271

                The electrocatalysts undergo structural reconstruction during electrocatalytic reactions, accompanied by significant variations in the catalytic activity and selectivity. However, it is still challenging to track in situ structural evolution and reaction process simultaneously to further figure out the origin of the surface reconstruction and its correlation to the electrocatalytic performance. By utilizing the species involved in formic acid electrooxidation reaction (FAER) as probe molecules, we employed electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (EC-SERS) to reveal that the surface reconstruction process occurred on Au core-Pt shell nanoparticles (Au@Pt NPs). Via potential-dependent Raman features, we clearly revealed that the Au atoms from the Au core can migrate to the ultrathin Pt shell during FAER. Importantly, in situ SERS spectra showed that the reconstruction of Au@Pt NPs originated from the CO produced during the electrocatalytic process. We further showed that this structural transformation reduces the CO binding strength on Pt surfaces and tailors the reaction pathways of the FAER, thus facilitating the pathway of direct dehydrogenation of formic acid to CO2 by 2.6 times. This work demonstrates the importance of structural evolution of electrocatalysts during the reaction process to the catalytic performance, providing insight for designing highly efficient and robust electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>PhotoROMP: The Future Is Bright</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00972</link>
      <description>Andrew J. Greenlee, Raymond A. Weitekamp, Jeffrey C. Foster, Samuel Leguizamon, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394680291

                Since the earliest investigations of olefin metathesis catalysis, light has been the choice for controlling the catalyst activity on demand. From the perspective of energy efficiency, temporal and spatial control, and selectivity, photochemistry is not only an attractive alternative to traditional thermal manufacturing techniques but also arguably a superior manifold for advanced applications like additive manufacturing (AM). In the last three decades, pioneering work in the field of ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) has broadened the scope of material properties achievable through AM, particularly using light as both an activating and deactivating stimulus. In this Perspective, we explore trends in photocontrolled ROMP systems with an emphasis on approaches to photoinduced activation and deactivation of metathesis catalysts. Recent work has yielded a myriad of commercial and synthetically accessible photosensitive catalyst systems, although comparatively little attention has been paid to achieving precise control over polymer morphology using light. Metal-free, photophysical, and living ROMP systems have also been relatively underexplored. To take fuller advantage of both the thermomechanical properties of ROMP polymers and the operational simplicity of photocontrol, clear directions for the field are to improve the reversibility of activation and deactivation strategies as well as to further develop photocontrolled approaches to tuning cross-link density and polymer tacticity.</description>

      <title>Double Catalytic Activity Unveiled: Synthesis, Characterization, and Catalytic Applications of Iridium Complexes in Transfer Hydrogenation and Photomediated Transformations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00673</link>
      <description>Laura Blanco, Andrea Uroz, Kevin Guti&#233;rrez, Silvia Cabrera, Alba Collado, Jos&#233; V. Alem&#225;n, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394714242

                Iridium complexes have been demonstrated to be highly active catalysts for a wide variety of transformations. Their unique photophysical and photochemical properties render them as one of the most established photocatalysts. Moreover, iridium complexes are widely acknowledged for their efficiency in transfer hydrogenation reactions. However, the development of iridium complexes able to promote both traditional organometallic catalysis and photocatalysis is scarce. Thus, the design of iridium-based catalysts is still an active area of research. In this context, we targeted the synthesis of a family of Ir-Cp* systems to explore their (photo)catalytic applications. Here, we describe the synthesis, structural characterization, and photophysical properties of iridium complexes of formula [IrCp*Cl(N^O)]. These complexes have been applied with a double catalytic function, in transfer hydrogenation for carbonyl reduction and in different photomediated transformations.</description>

      <title>Rhodium(II)-Catalyzed Asymmetric Cyclopropanation and Desymmetrization of [2.2]Paracyclophanes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01292</link>
      <description>Duc Ly, John Bacsa, Huw M. L. Davies, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394714316

                Chiral [2.2]paracyclophane derivatives are of considerable interest because of their potential in asymmetric catalysis and the development of chiral materials. This study describes the scope of rhodium-catalyzed reactions of aryldiazoacetates with [2.2]paracyclophanes. The reaction with the parent [2.2]paracyclophane resulted in cyclopropanation at two positions, the ratio of which is catalyst-controlled. Because of the strain in the system, one of the cyclopropanes exists primarily as the norcaradiene structure, whereas the other preferentially exists as the cycloheptatriene conformer. In contrast, the reaction with [3.3]paracyclophane results in benzylic C&#8211;H functionalization. The reactions with substituted [2.2]paracyclophanes using chiral catalysts can result in either kinetic resolution or desymmetrization. The Rh2(S-p-PhTPCP)]4-catalyzed reaction of monosubstituted paracyclophanes results in kinetic resolution with a selectivity (s) factor of up to 20, whereas reactions on C2v-symmetric disubstituted [2.2]paracyclophanes with Rh2(S-TPPTTL)4 [TPPTTL = 2-(1,3-dioxo-4,5,6,7-tetraphenylisoindolin-2-yl)-3,3-dimethylbutanoate] results in effective desymmetrization to form cycloheptatriene-incorporated paracyclophanes in 78&#8211;98% ee.</description>

      <title>Nickel-Based Catalysts for the Selective Monoarylation of Dichloropyridines: Ligand Effects and Mechanistic Insights</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00648</link>
      <description>Geraldo Duran-Camacho, Douglas C. Bland, Fangzheng Li, Sharon R. Neufeldt, Melanie S. Sanford, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394728071

                This report describes a detailed study of Ni phosphine catalysts for the Suzuki&#8211;Miyaura coupling of dichloropyridines with halogen-containing (hetero)aryl boronic acids. With most phosphine ligands, these transformations afford mixtures of mono- and diarylated cross-coupling products as well as competing oligomerization of the boronic acid. However, a ligand screen revealed that PPh2Me and PPh3 afford high yield and selectivity for monoarylation over diarylation as well as minimal competing oligomerization of the boronic acid. Several key observations were made regarding the selectivity of these reactions, including: (1) phosphine ligands that afford high selectivity for monoarylation fall within a narrow range of Tolman cone angles (between 136 and 157&#176;); (2) more electron-rich trialkylphosphines afford predominantly diarylated products, while less electron-rich di- and triarylphosphines favor monoarylation; (3) diarylation proceeds via intramolecular oxidative addition; and (4) the solvent (MeCN) plays a crucial role in achieving high monoarylation selectivity. Experimental and density functional theory studies suggest that all of these data can be explained based on the reactivity of a key intermediate: a Ni0&#8211;&#960; complex of the monoarylated product. With larger, more electron-rich trialkylphosphine ligands, this &#960; complex undergoes intramolecular oxidative addition faster than ligand substitution by the MeCN solvent, leading to selective diarylation. In contrast, with relatively small di- and triarylphosphine ligands, associative ligand substitution by MeCN is competitive with oxidative addition, resulting in the selective formation of monoarylated products. The generality of this method is demonstrated with a variety of dichloropyridines and chloro-substituted aryl boronic acids. Furthermore, the optimal ligand (PPh2Me) and solvent (MeCN) are leveraged to achieve Ni-catalyzed monoarylation of a broader set of dichloroarene substrates.</description>

      <title>Supported Catalytically Active Liquid Metal Solutions: Liquid Metal Catalysis with Ternary Alloys, Enhancing Activity in Propane Dehydrogenation</title>

                The research and optimization of catalysts are instrumental in revolutionizing chemical processes and making them viable in terms of energy and resources. Supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS) are highly active and stable in the harsh environment of the dehydrogenation reaction of alkanes. This is attributed to their liquid and dynamic nature and their isolated catalytically active single-atom sites. SCALMS consists of a liquid metal matrix (gallium) in which a catalytically active transition metal (platinum, rhodium, palladium, or nickel) is dissolved. Binary SCALMS systems are the subject of extensive research, aiming at a better understanding for achieving optimal performance. This work uses a combined multidisciplinary approach to examine ternary systems of the active transition metal platinum with mixtures of gallium with either tin or indium. Reaction engineering and surface chemical analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are combined with density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning force field (ML-FF) simulations. Introducing a third metal into the mixture alters the reactivity, surface composition, and concentration gradient in the liquid metal catalyst. We demonstrate that changes in catalytic reactivity correlate with changes in the surface concentration of the active transition metal platinum and of the position of the d-band center. These findings hold great promise for future research directions as they offer potential starting points for developing SCALMS systems.</description>

      <title>Nickel-Catalyzed Deoxygenative Disulfuration of Alcohols to Access Unsymmetrical Disulfides</title>

      <description>X. Chen, Wang Shao, Guo&#8208;Jun Deng, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394761010

                Given the abundance of alcohol feedstocks and the significance of disulfides, we herein report a nickel-catalyzed direct deoxygenative disulfuration of alcohols with trisulfide dioxides to access a wide range of disulfide molecules without the cumbersome decoration of coupling partners. The use of readily available dicyclohexylcarbodiimide to form transient isoureas provides the activation of the high bond dissociation energy of the C&#8211;O bond, which facilitates the straightforward conversion of nonderivatized alcohols to forge a C&#8211;SS bond. Notably, this method obviates a preactivation multistep procedure and provides a catalytic turnover under exogenous ligand and base-free conditions, featuring a broad substrate scope and functional group compatibility. It thus offers a robust alternative to existing methods for the precise construction of versatile disulfide compounds from more abundant and commercially available substrates. The synthetic utility of the method was further showcased by successful gram-scale experiments and disulfuration of structurally complex pharmaceuticals.</description>

      <title>Practical Machine Learning-Assisted Design Protocol for Protein Engineering: Transaminase Engineering for the Conversion of Bulky Substrates</title>

                Protein engineering is essential for improving the catalytic performance of enzymes for applications in biocatalysis, in which machine learning provides an emerging approach for variant design. Transaminases are powerful biocatalysts for the stereoselective synthesis of chiral amines but one major challenge is their limited substrate scope. We present a general and practical variant design protocol for protein engineering to combine the advantages of three strategies, including directed evolution, rational design, and machine learning, and demonstrate the application of the protocol in the protein engineering of transaminases with higher activity toward bulky substrates. A high-quality data set was obtained by rational design of selected key positions, which was then applied to create a machine learning model for transaminase activity. This model was applied for the data-assisted design of optimized variants, which showed improved activity (up to 3-fold over parent) for three bulky substrates, maintaining enantioselectivity of the starting enzyme scaffold as well as improving the enantiomeric excess (up to &gt;99%ee).</description>

                Solar-assisted CO2 conversion into fuels and chemical products involves a range of technologies aimed at driving industrial decarbonization methods. In this work, we report on the development of a series of multifunctional metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) based on nitro- or amino-functionalized UiO-66(M) (M: Zr or Zr/Ti) supported RuOx NPs as photocatalysts, having different energy band level diagrams, for CO2 hydrogenation under simulated concentrated sunlight irradiation. RuOx(1 wt %; 2.2 &#177; 0.9 nm)@UiO-66(Zr/Ti)-NO2 was found to be a reusable photocatalyst, to be selective for CO2 methanation (5.03 mmol g&#8211;1 after 22 h;, apparent quantum yield at 350, 400, and 600 nm of 1.67, 0.25, and 0.01%, respectively), and to show about 3&#8211;6 times activity compared with previous investigations. The photocatalysts were characterized by advanced spectroscopic techniques like femto- and nanosecond transient absorption, spin electron resonance, and photoluminescence spectroscopies together with (photo)electrochemical measurements. The photocatalytic CO2 methanation mechanism was assessed by operando FTIR spectroscopy. The results indicate that the most active photocatalyst operates under a dual photochemical and photothermal mechanism. This investigation shows the potential of multifunctional MOFs as photocatalysts for solar-driven CO2 recycling.</description>

      <title>Generation of Sulfamoyl Radical for the Modular Synthesis of Sulfonamides</title>

                Efficient synthesis of sulfonamides has long been pursued by chemists due to their frequent occurrence in pharmaceuticals, especially in anti-inflammatory medicines. The traditional assembly from sulfonyl chlorides and amines, as well as the recently developed one-step synthesis of sulfonamides involving sulfur dioxide, still faces challenges such as poor substrate compatibility and/or stringent reaction conditions. Herein, we present a strategy for the in situ generation of sulfamoyl radicals for the one-step modular synthesis of both alkenyl and alkyl sulfonamides with wide substrate applicability (&gt;100 examples), mild reaction conditions, and easily accessible starting materials. This method is successfully applied to the late-stage modification of drug molecules (23 examples), the one-step synthesis of the drug molecule naratriptan, and the 15N-labeling of sulfonamides.</description>

      <title>Stable Operation of Paired CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction/Glycerol Oxidation at High Current Density</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05952</link>
      <description>Attila Korm&#225;nyos, Adrienn Szirmai, Bal&#225;zs Endr&#337;di, Csaba Jan&#225;ky, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394786891

                Despite the considerable efforts made by the community, the high operation cell voltage of CO2 electrolyzers is still to be decreased to move toward commercialization. This is mostly due to the high energy need of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is the most often used anodic pair for CO2 reduction. In this study, OER was replaced by the electrocatalytic oxidation of glycerol using carbon-supported Pt nanoparticles as an anode catalyst. In parallel, the reduction of CO2 to CO was performed at the Ag cathode catalyst using a membraneless microfluidic flow electrolyzer cell. Several parameters were optimized, starting from the catalyst layer composition (ionomer quality and quantity), through operating conditions (glycerol concentration, applied electrolyte flow rate, etc.), to the applied electrochemical protocol. By identifying the optimal conditions, a 75&#8211;85% Faradaic efficiency (FE) toward glycerol oxidation products (oxalate, glycerate, tartronate, lactate, glycolate, and formate) was achieved at 200 mA cm&#8211;2 total current density while the cathodic CO formation proceeded with close to 100% FE. With static protocols (potentio- or galvanostatic), a rapid loss of glycerol oxidation activity was observed during the long-term measurements. The anode catalyst was reactivated by applying a dynamic potential step protocol. This allowed the periodic reduction, hence, refreshing of Pt, ensuring stable, continuous operation for 5 h.</description>
