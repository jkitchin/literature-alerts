      <title>Solvent-Free Hydroxylation of Unactivated C&#8211;H Bonds in Small Molecules and Macromolecules by a Fe Complex</title>

                One approach to mitigate the crisis of plastic waste is "chemical upcycling", in which waste plastic is either converted into products with higher economic value or depolymerized to its constituent monomer(s). Toward this goal, several metal-catalyzed postfunctionalizations of polymers have been reported, with variable success, mostly on account of a lack of selectivity, the use of harsh reaction conditions, and the use of environmentally unfriendly solvents. We herein demonstrate the selective hydroxylation of the backbone 3&#176; C&#8211;H bonds in synthetic macromolecules (polyolefin and polystyrene) using the in-house developed (Et4N)2[FeIII-(Ph,Me-bTAML)] (3) complex and solid Na2CO3&#183;1.5H2O2 (SPC; sodium percarbonate) under solvent-free mechanochemical conditions. The reaction only employs simple mechanochemical grinding or ball milling at room temperature. The polar functional group &#8211;OH was successfully incorporated into the polymer backbone without any chain degradation and cross-linking. The same reaction conditions were also employed to selectively hydroxylate small organic molecules including complex natural products. The rate and selectivity of the reaction toward 3&#176; C&#8211;H bonds far exceed that performed under homogeneous conditions. Mechanistic investigation indicates the formation of the well-characterized oxoiron(V) intermediate upon mechanical grinding of 3 and SPC. The high selectivity observed under solvent-free conditions is due to the elimination of the solvent-induced side reaction of this intermediate. This reaction represents an environment-friendly process since it uses environmentally benign reagents (iron complex, "oxygen bleach") and eliminates the use of hazardous solvents. The workup protocol involves simple washing with water, where both the spent catalyst and the oxidant are soluble. Selective mechanochemical oxidation of alkyl and benzylic 3&#176; C&#8211;H bonds often found in commercial polymers, such as polyolefin and polystyrene, may offer a potentially useful method to generate oxyfunctionalized material and also provide routes for the deconstruction of macromolecules with strong C&#8211;C bonds under mild conditions.</description>

      <title>Electric Fields Are a Key Determinant of Carbapenemase Activity in Class A &#946;-Lactamases</title>

                Resistance to antibiotics is a public health crisis. Although carbapenems are less susceptible to resistance than other &#946;-lactam antibiotics, &#946;-lactamases mediating resistance against these drugs are spreading. Here, we dissect the contributions of electric fields to carbapenemase activity in class A &#946;-lactamases. We perform QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations of meropenem acyl-enzyme hydrolysis that correctly discriminate carbapenemases. Electric field analysis shows that active-site fields in the deacylation transition state and tetrahedral intermediate are important determinants of activity. The active-site fields identify several residues, some distal, that distinguish efficient carbapenemases. Our field analysis script (www.github.com/bunzela/FieldTools) may help in understanding and combating antibiotic resistance.</description>

                With heterogeneous catalysts, chemical promotion takes place at their surfaces. Even in the case of single-atom alloys, where small quantities of a reactive metal are dispersed within the main host, it is assumed that both elements are exposed and available to bond with the reactants. Here, we show, on the basis of in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy data, that in alloy catalysts made from Pt highly diluted in Cu the Pt atoms are located at the inner interface between the metal nanoparticles and the silica support instead. Kinetic experiments indicated that these catalysts still display better selectivity for the hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes to unsaturated alcohols than the pure metals. Density functional theory calculations corroborated the stability of Pt at the metal&#8211;support interface and explained the catalytic performance as being due to a remote lowering of the activation barrier for the dissociation of H2 at Cu sites by the internal Pt atoms.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of Hydrogen Spillover on Metal-Doped Carbon Materials: Surface Carboxylic Groups Are Key</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00293</link>
      <description>Javier Navarro&#8208;Ruiz, J&#233;r&#233;my Audevard, M. Vidal, Cristian H. Campos, Iker del Rosal, Philippe Serp, Iann C. Gerber, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4395042772

                Hydrogen spillover (H-spillover) is the surface migration of activated hydrogen atoms from a metallic particle on which they are generated onto a support. The phenomenon has been widely studied because of its implication in hydrogen storage and in catalytic reactions involving hydrogen. Its existence on carbon materials is well established, but questions remain regarding its mechanism and the involvement of surface oxygen groups. In this study, we combined experimental work with chemical modeling to study the mechanisms of H-spillover on a representative system, including a carbon material presenting basal and prismatic surfaces: oxidized carbon nanotubes doped with Pd. The experimental results, supported by those of modeling, show that the surface carboxylic acid groups are the key species, allowing the spillover of hydrogen on carbon materials to take place. The carboxylic groups can also work in combination with phenol groups to facilitate H-spillover. If the concentration of these groups is too low, then the H-spillover does not operate, except in the case of the addition of water, which serves as a shuttle for the protons. This study leads to a deeper understanding of the long-debated issue of H-spillover on carbon materials and provides insight into designing systems with enhanced properties.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Dynamics of Oxygen Vacancy in ZnO&lt;sub&gt;1&#8211;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;/Cu during Robust Methanol Synthesis from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;</title>

                The extensive investigation regarding the active site of the Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst gradually recognizes the paramount importance of the oxygen vacancy in the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. However, it is challenging to probe the nature of oxygen vacancy during methanol synthesis and understand its role in the enhancement of reactivity at the molecule level. Here, the inversed ZnO1&#8211;x/Cu catalysts with abundant oxygen vacancies are prepared by simple ball milling. The interfacial transformations between ZnO1&#8211;x and Cu during material preparation and reaction are elucidated by the correlations of geometrical and chemical states with mechanical energies. The dynamics of the oxygen vacancy during the reaction are revealed as well. The ZnO1&#8211;x/Cu with more oxygen vacancy exhibits a superior CH3OH productivity of 1.2 gMeOH g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 at 240 &#176;C and a selectivity above 90%. The mechanistic studies reveal that oxygen vacancy promotes the activation of CO2 to formate and significantly reduces the barrier of the hydrogenation from *HCOO to *H2COO intermediates.</description>

                A cooperative NHC/nickel catalytic methodology has been developed for the synthesis of ketones employing aromatic aldehydes and tertiary alkyl iodides. All key steps of the postulated catalytic cycle were validated with comprehensive stoichiometric and electrochemical studies, including reduction of NiII by the deprotonated Breslow intermediate, Ni0 promoted halogen-atom abstraction to generate transient tertiary alkyl radicals, and coupling between the latter with the persistent acyl thiazolium radical intermediate. Such a broadly proposed and accepted, yet elusive, acyl thiazolium radical intermediate has been isolated and studied by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction study.</description>

      <title>Local Magnetic Effect-Induced Electron Configuration Regulation: Spin Flipping of Iron Centers for Molecular Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00285</link>

                Efficient oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) rely on the appropriate chemical adsorption of triplet oxygen (O2) on the surface of the catalyst and rapid conversion to doublet intermediate species, accelerating the ORR process. However, overcoming the energy barrier of this spin-forbidden transition via spin coupling with a catalyst remains a major challenge. Herein, iron phthalocyanine (FePc) was attached to the intrinsic atomic step sites on semiconductor TiO2 nanotubes (FePc@TiO2). The inherent magnetic field of these TiO2 atomic step sites induced a spin flip within the Fe 3d near the Fermi level, resulting in enhanced Fe&#8211;O covalent bonding as a result of the spin-antiparallel alignment of the electrons in the Fe 3d and the electrons in the &#960; antibonding orbital of the key oxygen intermediate. This process effectively accelerated the protonation step from *OO to *OOH and activated adsorbed O2 to promote efficient ORR. Compared with the half-wave potential of the original FePc molecule, the half-wave potential of FePc@TiO2 greatly increased by 67 mV, up to 0.921 V in 0.1 M KOH. We confirm that the magnetic flipping of single-molecule magnet catalysts is an effective approach for reducing the spin activation barrier of O2, providing a strategy for the rational design of spin-based catalysts in oxygen-involved reactions for energy conversion devices.</description>

                Transition-metal-catalyzed enantioselective C&#8211;H functionalization has emerged as a promising method for the synthesis of P-stereogenic phosphorus compounds. However, previous reports are limited to the enantioselective functionalization of C(sp2)&#8211;H bonds of aryl phosphine derivatives. Herein, Pd(II)-catalyzed enantioselective arylation of more challenging C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds toward P-stereogenic dialkylphosphinamides is achieved through the desymmetrization of gem-diethyl groups. Various P-stereogenic dialkylphosphinamides are obtained with high enantioselectivities using 3,3&#8242;-CN2-H8-BINOL as the chiral ligand. The synthetic potential of this methodology is highlighted by gram-scale preparation and further derivatizations.</description>

                The high conductivity and low decomposition potential of LiOH as the discharge product in Li&#8211;O2 batteries have garnered significant attention. However, challenges remain in developing LiOH-based Li&#8211;O2 batteries and promoting efficient generation/decomposition of LiOH. Here, we propose a strategy to build a binder-free cathode for Li&#8211;O2 batteries by embedding atomically dispersed Ru onto the surface of MnCo2O4 (RuSA-MnCo2O4) through defect engineering and adsorption&#8211;deposition methods, harnessing the synergistic benefits of spinel and a single atom in terms of catalytic activity and physical structure. The embedding of Ru leads to slight lattice distortion of MnCo2O4 and electron enrichment near Co, breaking the long-range ordered and symmetrical structure of spinel and transforming the symmetrical Mn/Co low-activity centers into asymmetrical Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Co high-activity centers. Compared to that of MnCo2O4, the d-band center of RuSA-MnCo2O4 is positioned further away from the Fermi level, resulting in an increased occupancy of antibonding orbitals. This leads to more moderate adsorption energies for LiO2* and LiOH*, as well as a reduction in the reaction barrier for LiOH formation, thereby optimizing the kinetics of the redox reactions. Thanks to the catalytic active center regulated by RuSA, the electrochemical performances were greatly improved, which also provides a clever approach for the development of catalysts for LiOH-based Li&#8211;O2 batteries.</description>

      <title>Enantioselective [2+2] Cross-Photocycloaddition Enabled by a Chiral Cage Reactor via Multilevel-Selectivity Control</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01087</link>
      <description>Jia Ruan, Zhongshu Li, Changzhen Yin, Yu&#8208;Lin Lu, Zhang&#8208;Wen Wei, Peng Hu, Cheng&#8208;Yong Su, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4395447658

                In the recently burgeoning field of asymmetric [2 + 2] photocycloaddition, a challenging hurdle lies in achieving a multilevel control of chemo-, regio-, diastereo-, and enantioselectivities in cross-coupling photoreactions, which often result in chaotic outcomes when partners show similar electronic and optical properties. Here, we introduce a biomimetic cage-pocket confined photocatalytic protocol that can effectively realize bimolecular recognition and manipulate excited triplet-state dynamics through stereochemical confinement. This approach allows for highly selective synthesis of heterocoupled [2 + 2] syn-HH (head-to-head) enantiomers from two photoactive &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, which are typically difficult to access via conventional strategies due to competitive pathways. We find that the cooperative heteromolecular binding dynamics plays a critical role in initial chemoselective and successive stereoselective photoreactions. Notably, the open pockets of the cage reactor display tolerable guest&#8211;host match but products&#8211;host mismatch for a wide scope of substrates, overcoming common limitations associated with enzyme-mimicking cage reactors such as guest specificity and product inhibition against catalytic generality and turnover.</description>

                The application of selective catalytic reduction with ammonia (NH3-SCR) technology urgently requires catalysts with good performance to control nitrogen oxide (NOx, x = 1, 2) emissions, and structural analysis of such catalysts is necessary and crucial to elucidate the performance of catalytically active sites. Thus, we prepared molybdenum (Mo)-doped CeO2 catalysts to achieve a substantial leap in catalytic performance. The results revealed that the emergence of Ce3+&#8211;O&#8211;Ce3+ structural units induced by Mo doping achieved the low-energy barrier activation of the NH3 molecule, which transformed the dominant reaction mechanism in the catalytic reaction and thus led to a much better SCR performance. Furthermore, we designed tungsten (W)-doped CeO2 catalysts with the same doping amount as Mo and found that the catalysts exhibited almost the same activity trend as the Mo-doped CeO2 catalysts, which further confirmed the pivotal role of the Ce3+&#8211;O&#8211;Ce3+ structural units. This study provides a basic theoretical foundation for the design of ceria-based SCR catalysts with efficient catalytic performance for NOx removal.</description>

                Homogeneous catalysts&#9472;organometallic complexes but also organocatalysts or nanoparticle catalysts&#9472;display attractive features that are of high academic and industrial interest. Various concepts have been established for their integrated recycling in the realization of industrial processes with metal complexes to achieve quasistationary operation. With the constant development of novel synthetic tools and improved catalyst structures, innovative methods for their effective recycling remain an important and thoroughly investigated research objective. However, recycling experiments of homogeneous catalysts on a laboratory scale need to be carried out using reliable and generalized methods to collect valuable data that allow for conclusive comparison of different approaches. In this Perspective, we first analyze and categorize the industrial applied techniques for recycling of organometallic catalysts and then present and evaluate performance indicators of recycling methods on the research stage. As a conclusion, a best practice for planning and conducting experimental studies is suggested to generate and present comparable results across different laboratories and disciplines.</description>

      <title>Outer-Coordination-Sphere Interaction in a Molecular Iron Catalyst Allows Selective Methane Production from Carbon Monoxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c06112</link>

                Reduction of oxides of carbon (CO and CO2) to fixed forms of carbon is desirable to achieve sustainable and clean energy. Carbon monoxide (CO), an intermediate product in CO2 reduction, is challenging to reduce, which in turn jeopardizes the direct reduction of CO2 beyond 2e&#8211;/2H+ to products like CH3OH and CH4. Iron porphyrins can efficiently reduce CO2 to CO by 2e&#8211;/2H+, but further reduction is halted by the rapid dissociation of CO from the reduced iron center. This work shows that CO can indeed be reduced upon inclusion of a pendent pyridine in the second coordination sphere of an iron porphyrin complex efficiently and selectively to CH4 using water or phenol as the proton source. In situ spectro-electrochemistry supported by theoretical calculations indicates that the pendent pyridine moiety imposes a hydrogen bonding interaction between the bound CO and water, which stabilizes two low-valent CO adducts, i.e., Fe(I)&#8211;CO and Fe(0)&#8211;CO, of iron porphyrins, allowing its complete reduction, via a Fe(II)&#8211;CHO species, to CH4. The ability to activate and reduce CO by ne&#8211;/nH+ via a second-sphere hydrogen bonding interaction in a mononuclear iron porphyrin opens newer pathways to valorize both CO and CO2 to valuable C1 products.</description>

      <title>Substrate-Dependent Mechanism Switch in the Desaturation Reactions of the Mononuclear Nonheme Iron Enzyme PtlD</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00757</link>

                PtlD, a multifunctional mononuclear nonheme iron and &#945;-ketoglutarate-dependent (NHFe/&#945;-KG) dioxygenase involved in neopentalenoketolactone biosynthesis, catalyzes hydroxylation, desaturation, and olefin epoxidation reactions. Investigating desaturation reactions of nonactivated carbons mediated by NHFe/&#945;-KG enzymes is intriguing, especially for understanding the fate of the substrate radicals formed after hydrogen atom abstraction by FeIV&#9552;O species. Here, we investigate the desaturation reaction mechanism of PtlD using two distinct substrates: neopentalenolactone D (1) features a lone pair-containing oxygen atom adjacent to the olefin-forming carbon atoms, whereas pentalenolactone D (7) harbors a carbonyl group at the corresponding position. For substrate 1, our isotope effect measurement and protein mutagenesis experiments suggest the formation of a carbocation intermediate, which is subsequently deprotonated by a base to generate the desaturation products. Residue K288 serves as the base, while Y113 likely stabilizes the carbocation via a &#960;-cation interaction. For substrate 7, oxygen incorporation patterns indicated that a carbocation intermediate is also formed but is unstable, leading to hydroxylation due to H2O quenching. Notably, substrate 7's desaturation exhibits a temperature-dependent large kinetic isotope effect (KIE) and an inverse solvent isotope effect (SIE), suggesting that hydrogen tunneling contributes to the electron&#8211;proton transfer (EPT) process. These findings collectively reveal the cases of NHFe/&#945;-KG enzymes, where distinct desaturation mechanisms switch with different substrates.</description>

      <title>Importance of Dynamic Effects in Isobutanol to Linear Butene Conversion Catalyzed by Acid Zeolites Assessed by AIMD</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00736</link>

                Dehydration of alcohols into alkenes is a key reaction for the production of fuels and chemicals from biomass. However, the mechanism of these reactions is highly questionable, hindering the rational optimization of efficient catalysts. In the present work, the formation of linear butenes starting from isobutanol catalyzed by proton-exchanged zeolites is unraveled by ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). Comparison with static calculations done for a gas phase reaction catalyzed by a proton and for the prototypical chabazite zeolite framework shows that AIMD estimations of the free energy barriers are significantly different from the static ones. Moreover, a common transition state (TS) is found for two competing reactions, namely, the isomerization of isobutanol into butan-2-ol (the dehydration of the latter yielding linear butenes) and the synchronous dehydration and isomerization of isobutanol into products related to linear butenes in a single step. The existence of a post-TS bifurcation prevents a traditional estimation of rates by transition state theory. To circumvent this problem, we quantify relative transmission coefficients using the Bennett&#8211;Chandler theory, which shows a clear tendency for decrease of relative frequency for isobutanol isomerization and increase of that for synchronous dehydration and isomerization when switching from 100 to 500 K. This work represents a step forward for the accurate determination of rates for key reactions in alcohol dehydration reactions.</description>

                FeN4 active sites have been studied as non-Pt group metal (non-PGM) catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The authors recently developed Fe(II) 1,14:7,8-ditethenotetrapyrido-[2,1,6-de:2&#8242;,1&#8242;6&#8242;-gh:2&#8243;,1&#8243;,6&#8243;-na][1,3,5,8,10,12] hexaazacyclotetradecine (Fe-14MR) as an FeN4 complex incorporating a 14-membered ring. This complex exhibited higher ORR activity and greater durability than Fe phthalocyanine, a conventional FeN4 complex having a 16-membered ring. In the present study, the ORR activity and durability of this Fe-14MR complex supported on C (Fe-14MR/C) were enhanced through modification of the active site structure by heating at 600 &#176;C and removing protons on amine groups in the Fe-14MR. Density functional theory calculations indicated that the Fe-14MR/C structure generated by heating resulted in oxygen species absorption energies close to optimal values for the ORR. The improved durability of the heat-treated Fe-14MR/C was attributed to reduced distortion of the FeN4 sites. The results suggest that designing Fe-14MR structures can be a promising approach to developing non-PGM catalysts.</description>
