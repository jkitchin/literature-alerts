      <title>Facet-Dependent Oxygen Mobility and Reaction Pathways for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of 1-Butene over Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;</title>

                The crystal facet effect is a critical factor for catalytic reactions on metal oxides due to the different atomic arrangements and physicochemical properties of diverse facets. Based on a series of combined experimental and theoretical measurements, this work investigates facet-dependent oxygen mobility and reaction pathways for the oxidation dehydrogenation (ODH) of 1-butene to 1,3-butadiene on Bi2MoO6, which exposes the {001} and {010} facets (BMO-001 and BMO-010). The results show that the oxygen mobility of BMO-001 overwhelmingly outperforms that of BMO-010, reflecting the better capacities for selective abstraction of H from 1-butene, oxygen replenishment, and bulk lattice oxygen migration. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the rate-determining step on the {001} facet is the abstraction of the first H in 1-butene and the abstraction of the second H on the {010} facet. The existence of the [Bi2O2]2+ layer provides a favorable channel with a low-energy barrier for bulk lattice oxygen migration toward the {001} facet. Besides, complex side reactions occur on the {010} facet, including the nonselective oxidation of 1-butene, aromatization of 1-butene, and the generation of CO and subsequent formates. The total oxidation and decomposition of byproducts result in extra CO2 formation pathways. Lattice and gaseous oxygen play different roles in the above reactions. The superior oxygen mobility contributes to the high 1,3-butadiene yield for BMO-001, while the extra CO2 formation pathways lead to an abnormally high CO2 yield for BMO-010. The generated aromatic coke and formates affect the catalytic stability of BMO-010. The facet-dependent oxygen mobility and reaction pathways result in a distinct catalytic performance for 1-butene ODH.</description>

      <title>Selective Light Hydrocarbon Production from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Hydrogenation over Na/ZnFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and CHA-Zeolite Hybrid Catalysts</title>

                Carbon dioxide hydrogenation to value-added fuels and chemicals has been studied widely as a means to recycle the most-troublesome greenhouse gas. The reaction produces hundreds of different chemicals, and therefore, selectivity control toward specific desired products is of paramount importance. In this study, a hybrid catalyst system consisting of Na/ZnFe2O4 (ZFO) and a CHA-zeolite (SSZ-13 or SAPO-34) is developed to maximize C2&#8211;C4 light hydrocarbon production. Utilizing the compact 3.8 &#197; pore size of CHA-zeolites, the Na/ZnFe2O4 catalyst-produced long-chain hydrocarbons are efficiently shortened to C2&#8211;C4 hydrocarbons with over 55% selectivity in the hybrid systems. Notably, ZFO + SAPO-34 shows a preference for light olefins, while ZFO + SSZ-13 uniquely enhances selectivity for C3 products. The difference is attributed to the much stronger acid sites present in SSZ-13 than in SAPO-34, which promote hydrogenation of olefins and the ethylene-to-propane conversion reaction in particular. Further modification of SSZ-13 with steam treatment leads to the dealumination of its framework and an enhanced activity of the ethylene-to-propane reaction, yielding 32.8% of C3-selectivity. Accordingly, a hybrid catalytic system combining a CO2 Fischer&#8211;Tropsch catalyst with a CHA-zeolite is a promising route to produce light hydrocarbons from CO2 hydrogenation more selectively than single catalysts. This work also demonstrates that acidity control could be a powerful tool to manipulate the reaction pathway that occurs on zeolite catalysts.</description>

      <title>Influence of Solvents on Catalytic C&#8211;H Bond Oxidation by a Copper(II)&#8211;Alkylperoxo Complex</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05643</link>
      <description>Yuri Lee, Bohee Kim, S.C. Kim, Elvis Wang Hei Ng, Shinya Ariyasu, Shoji Okada, Sungho Yoon, Hajime Hirao, Jaeheung Cho, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391966230

                Oxidation of unactivated alkanes, which requires substantial energy for conversion to valuable organic chemicals, is a major challenge in both industry and academia. Herein, we describe how solvents affect and improve the catalytic oxidation ability of a mononuclear copper(II)&#8211;alkylperoxo complex, [CuII(iPr3-tren)(OOC(CH3)2Ph)]+ (1, iPr3-tren = tris[2-(isopropylamino)ethyl]amine), toward hydrocarbon substrates. 1 was prepared by adding cumene hydroperoxide and triethylamine to the solution of [Cu(iPr3-tren)(CH3CN)]2+, which was characterized using various physicochemical methods. Product analyses, along with theoretical calculations, indicate that homolytic O&#8211;O bond cleavage occurs during the thermal decomposition of 1 at 60 &#176;C in various solvents such as CH3CN, CH3COCH3, C6H5CF3, and C6H6. Both experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations supported variations in the catalytic activity of 1 depending on solvents. In CH3CN and CH3COCH3, 1 activates weak C&#8211;H bonds (bond dissociation energy (BDE) &#8804; &#8764;81.6 kcal mol&#8211;1), while 1 in C6H5CF3 and C6H6 can oxidize slightly stronger C&#8211;H bonds with a BDE of up to 84.5 kcal mol&#8211;1. In supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2), 1 can oxidize alkanes with strong C&#8211;H bonds, such as cyclohexane (99.5 kcal mol&#8211;1). The enhanced C&#8211;H bond oxidation of 1 in C6H5CF3, C6H6, and SC-CO2 was generally attributed to two different factors: (a) the nonpolarity of the solvent and (b) the absence of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds in the solvent. Interestingly, in CH2Cl2, a nonpolar solvent with C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds, 1 exhibited similar reactivity to that in C6H5CF3, indicating that nonpolar solvents enhance the catalytic ability of copper(II)&#8211;cumylperoxo complex to abstract hydrogen atoms from substrates, regardless of the presence of C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds in solvent molecules. DFT calculations employing an implicit solvent model further supported the enhanced reactivity, without the need to account for the presence of a C(sp3)&#8211;H bond. The reactivity of the different possible reactive intermediates arising from the catalytic oxidation was also explored using DFT calculations. This study provides a perspective on how solvents can be utilized to modulate the catalytic effects on C&#8211;H bond activation.</description>

      <title>Design of Ancestral Sortase E that is Applicable in Protein Biomaterial Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c00487</link>
      <description>Azusa Miyata, Taichi Chisuga, Akira Kambe, Ryo Miyata, Yui Kawamura, Hiroyuki Takeda, Sohei Ito, Shogo Nakano, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391970017

                Protein biomaterials would have the potential to address global challenges in health and environment. Numerous production methods of the biomaterials exist, with sortase-mediated ligation (SML) being one of the representative technique. SML facilitates the site-specific conjugation of two compounds: donor peptides or proteins with a cell wall sorting signal at their C-terminus and nucleophiles that have oligoglycine at their N-terminal. In our research, we reconstructed an ancestral sortase E, named AcSE5, through a combination of sequence data mining and ancestral sequence reconstruction. AcSE5, a Ca2+ independent sortase, recognizes donors with LAETG at their C-termini and can employ both peptides bearing GGG- or GAA-at N-terminus and straight-chained alkylamines as nucleophiles. The enzyme can achieve efficient peptide conjugation, exceeding 70% under optimal conditions. With AcSE5, we synthesized two protein conjugates: Venus-conjugated shark variable new antigen receptor (VNAR) and dual-conjugated VNAR via poly(ethylene) glycol diamine. Direct enzyme immobilization to amino-terminated polystyrene beads was also achieved using AcSE5. The resultant beads, when conjugated with hyper-thermostable ancestral l-amino acid oxidases (HTAncLAAO2), can be employed for deracemization of various racemic amino acids into d-form. For three of phenylalanine derivatives, preparative-scale (100 mg scale) deracemization can be achieved. This process provides high enantiopurity (&gt;99% ee) and isolation yields (&gt;64%) through chemoenzymatic reactions. The immobilized HTAncLAAO2 showed complete resistance to 10 repeated reactions for a total of 240 h. AcSE5 is an excellent enzyme for SML applications.</description>

      <title>Alanyl-tRNA Synthetase-like Enzyme-Catalyzed Aminoacylation in Nucleoside Sulfamate Ascamycin Biosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05667</link>
      <description>Yu Zheng, Naoko Morita, Hiroshi Takagi, Yumi Shiozaki-Sato, Jun Ishikawa, Kazuo Shin&#8208;ya, Shunji Takahashi, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391972423

                The adenosine 5&#8242;-monophosphate-mimicking nucleoside sulfamates are pharmaceutically important compounds that target aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) and other adenylate-forming enzymes. Ascamycin (1) is a unique naturally occurring alanyl adenosine sulfamate isolated from Streptomyces sp. 80H647. In this study, we successfully enhanced the in vivo conversion of dealanylascamycin (2) to ascamycin by constitutively expressing an extra copy of bldA and adpA regulatory genes. More importantly, we performed gene expression analysis and protein structure&#8211;function prediction to identify alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AlaRS)-like enzymes: AcmF and AcmD. AcmF efficiently catalyzes the aminoacylation reaction during ascamycin biosynthesis, and this reaction is dependent on the Ala-tRNAAla supplied by AcmD. AcmF is a truncated AlaRS-like enzyme containing only the aminoacylation and tRNA recognition domains, whereas AcmD has an intact AlaRS-like architecture that efficiently supports AcmF activity by exhibiting resistance to the AcmF-produced ascamycin. In addition, we have produced the glycyl- and seryl-derivatives of ascamycin using the AcmD-AcmF enzyme pair. The mechanistic study identified Glu232 and several residues that play important roles in AcmF catalysis. To the best of our knowledge, AcmF is a representative class II aaRS-like enzyme catalyzing tRNA-dependent aminoacylation during natural product biosynthesis. These findings provide a potential chemoenzymatic approach for the synthesis of aminoacyl nucleoside sulfamates.</description>

      <title>Designing Local Electron Delocalization in 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Sunlight-Driven Photocatalytic Activity</title>

                Electron delocalization is a versatile method to tune the electronic structure of materials for maximizing their maximizing performances. Herein, TPBD covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with controlled electron-delocalization characteristics (denoted as TPBD-R-COF, R = H, F, CN, and NO2) were synthesized by molecular engineering to systematically investigate the effect of electron delocalization on photocatalytic performance. We found that the photocatalytic performance can be enhanced by modulating local electron delocalization in COFs. The photocatalytic activity of TPBD-CN-COF is more than 12 times greater than that of TPBD-H-COF in oxidative coupling of amines to imines, where the yield of product was increased from 8 to 99%. The experimental results and theoretical calculations revealed that TPBD-CN-COF with the optimal electron-attracting group of &#8722;CN shows the highest charge separation efficiency and electron transport rate, while excessive electron delocalization is not better for such properties. Our findings provide a strategy to design and optimize the photocatalytic performance of COF-based catalysts.</description>

                The development of technologies for the efficient synthesis of innovative antiviral compounds remains an important challenge for modern biotechnology, especially in the context of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. One of the drugs that is currently in the research spotlight for potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity is the purine mimetic prodrug compound T-705, also known as favipiravir. Along with a similar compound, T-1105, the activation of T-705 is limited by the low rate of phosphoribosylation, mediated by an enzyme named hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). Therefore, the synthesis of phosphoribosylated/ribosylated derivatives of these prodrugs is a viable direction for the discovery and development of antiviral pharmaceuticals. However, the chemical synthesis of such compounds is a complex and laborious process, whereas enzymatic cascades are not feasible because of the narrow HGPRT substrate specificity. Here, we report the successful rational design of an efficient biocatalyst for T-705/T-1105 phosphoribosylation. With two rounds of Thermus thermophilus HB27 HGPRT active site optimization, we have achieved a 325-fold increase in kcat toward the compound T-705 and a 125-fold increase toward T-1105 accompanied by a multifold decrease in KM. The practical applicability of the designed mutant was illustrated through the preparative synthesis of T-705/T-1105 nucleotide derivatives. Our engineered biocatalyst can become a basis for the technologies of enzymatic and chemoenzymatic synthesis of various T-705/T-1105 derivatives with proven antiviral activity. Moreover, our results provide insight into the molecular mechanism of T-705/T-1105 phosphoribosylation, including the experimental evidence explaining the reasons behind the low activity of HGPRT toward these compounds.</description>

                Industrial water electrolysis requires oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts that exhibit both high activity and adaptability to high current densities. However, single Ir atoms of the OER catalysts often show high performance in the three-electrode system but are limited to low current densities in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE). The high oxidation potential and catalyst shedding caused by oxygen bubble desorption have hindered the stability, resulting in unsatisfactory PEMWE performance. Achieving high catalytic stability under high current density conditions still presents a significant challenge for all of the OER catalysts. In this study, an efficient and stable catalytic system for OER is constructed by a doping strategy, which consists of atomically dispersed Ir sites in MnCo2O4.5. The integrated Ir&#8211;MnCo2O4.5 catalyst demonstrates remarkable OER activity, with a low overpotential of 238 mV at 10 mA/cm2. It exhibits long-term stability, maintaining this high activity for 700 h at 20 mA/cm2 with a degradation rate of 0.025 mV/h. Impressively, the PEMWE with the integrated Ir&#8211;MnCo2O4.5 as the anode remains stable even after nearly 100 h at 200 mA/cm2, outperforming most previously reported single-iridium atom-based PEMWEs. Density functional theory calculations show that the redistribution of charges brought by the introduction of Ir and Mn not only effectively reduces the dissolution of lattice oxygen and Ir active sites but also lowers the energy barrier of the rate-determining step, thereby significantly improving the stability and activity of Ir&#8211;MnCo2O4.5 under high current density.</description>

                The chiral allylic sulfonylated group is a unique structural motif embedded in a range of natural products and pharmaceuticals. Notably, the synthesis of structurally diverse chiral allylic sulfonylated derivatives via alkylsulfonylation of 1,3-dienes remains underexplored because of its inherent challenges in stereocontrol and regioselectivity. Herein, photoinduced, palladium-catalyzed enantioselective 1,2-alkylsulfonylation of conjugated 1,3-dienes is described. A wide variety of alkyl bromides, 1,3-dienes, and sodium sulfinates could be facilely coupled to generate value-added chiral allylic sulfonylated derivatives with high enantioselectivity. Finally, the utility of this enantioselective difunctionalization protocol was demonstrated in pharmaceutical analogue synthesis.</description>

      <title>Structure and Reactivity of Binuclear Cu Active Sites in Cu-CHA Zeolites for Stoichiometric Partial Methane Oxidation to Methanol</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c06181</link>

                Aluminosilicate zeolites exchanged with copper ions facilitate partial methane oxidation (PMO) to methanol in stoichiometric oxidation and reduction cycles, yet the identities of active Cu sites and details of the reaction mechanism remain debated. Here, we use the high-symmetry chabazite (CHA) zeolite framework as a model support to probe the relationship between bulk composition, Cu speciation, and response to various oxidizing and reducing treatments. Density functional theory and first-principles thermodynamics combined with statistical models reveal that Cu speciation and composition depend strongly on Al configuration and external gas conditions. Cu-CHA samples were synthesized to survey broad regions of Si/Al and Cu/Al composition space and framework Al proximity. Characterization by in situ X-ray absorption and UV&#8211;visible spectroscopy during exposure to different oxidation conditions reveal that the extent of Cu oxidation is sensitive to activation conditions and thus that both kinetic and thermodynamic factors influence Cu oxidizability in a given material. Similar characterizations during CO reduction reveal that CO titrates Cu2+ in amounts suggesting the presence of both O- and O2-bridged species. In contrast, CH4 and autoreduction (He) treatments reduce similar but smaller numbers of Cu sites than CO, implicating O2-bridged Cu dimers as a potential common intermediate in the former reduction pathways. A systematic increase in methanol yields (per Cu) in stoichiometric PMO cycles increase with the fraction of binuclear Ox-bridged Cu sites suggests these species as active sites, as depicted in an updated PMO reaction mechanism.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Regioselective Sulfonylsulfination of Alkenes</title>

                Regioselective 1,2-dichalcogenation of alkenes has attracted significant attention in modern organic synthetic chemistry. While there are a plethora of methods to access alkene dichalcogenated architectures, sulfonylsulfination of alkenes is extremely challenging due to the inherent characteristics of the sulfur atom. Herein, a multicomponent fragment coupling of alkenes, sulfinates, and DABSO was developed to construct densely functionalized sulfonylsulfinated products, which are otherwise challenging to access, with broad substrate scope and group tolerance under mild and operationally simple conditions, using an inexpensive 100&#8211;1000 ppm organic photocatalyst. In addition, the protocol was applied to the late-stage functionalization of complex molecules, and the obtained products were converted into diverse downstream transformations to demonstrate their synthetic potential. Experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations suggest that these reactions proceed through sequential sulfonyl and sulfinyl oxygen radical mutual transformations and radical&#8211;polar crossover coupling. This strategy provides access to previously inaccessible alkene sulfonylsulfinated products in good-to-high regio- and stereoselectivity, along with opening up previously unexplored synthetic directions.</description>

      <title>Atroposelective Synthesis of Axially Chiral Diaryl Ethers by Copper-Catalyzed Enantioselective Alkyne&#8211;Azide Cycloaddition</title>

                Diaryl ethers are important structural motifs widely found in bioactive natural products, ligands, and catalysts. While there are a variety of methods available to generate diaryl ethers, progress on the construction of axially chiral diaryl ethers has been slow. We report herein an atroposelective copper-catalyzed cycloaddition between bisalkynes and azides. With an indane-fused BOX ligand used, a diverse array of C&#8211;O atropisomers are obtained with up to 97% yield and 99% ee. Control experiments showed that a sequential enantioselective desymmetrization&#8211;kinetic resolution process is involved, and the former plays a major role. In addition, an asymmetric depletion is observed for this catalytic synthesis by nonlinear effect studies. By thermal racemization experiments, the rotational barrier of the C&#8211;O axis of 3aa is calculated to be 35.9 kcal/mol, which lays the foundation for its isolation, as well as further applications.</description>

      <title>Combined Hydrogen and Alkane Production by Photocatalytic Decarboxylative C&#8211;C Homocoupling of Fatty Acid by Constructing a Hydrogen-Deficient Catalytic Interface</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c06070</link>

                Decarboxylation of biomass-derived fatty acids provides an important method for the production of value-added alkane fuels and chemicals. Here, selective decarboxylative C&#8211;C homocoupling of fatty acids to obtain long-chain alkanes was achieved by heterogeneous photocatalysis under mild conditions. Hydrogen was cogenerated as the potential energy source. The high selectivity for the coupling product was realized by constructing a hydrogen-deficient catalytic interface through the combined action of Ru nanoparticles supported on TiO2 and continuous N2 blow, which can inhibit the hydrogenation of alkyl radicals and enhance the C&#8211;C coupling of alkyl radicals. C2n&#8211;2 saturated alkanes (as high as 93%) and hydrogen (as high as 20.3 &#956;mol&#183;mL&#8211;1) are produced from bioderived C4&#8211;C12 fatty acids in high yields under mild reaction conditions (25 &#176;C, N2 blow). Furthermore, low-value industrial fatty acid mixtures such as coconut oil and Cinnamomum camphora seed kernel oil can be directly applied in this catalytic system and selectively yield long-chain alkanes (up to 80%) in a solvent-free system. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and various analytical methods were applied to elucidate the possible catalytic mechanism.</description>

      <title>Surpassing the Limited Coordination Affinity of Native Amides by Introducing Pyridone-Pd-AgOAc Clusters to Promote Distal &#947;-C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&#8211;H Arylation</title>

                The utilization of weak coordination in promoting site-selective C(sp3)&#8211;H functionalization is of immense importance. Herein, we report a Pd-catalyzed distal &#947;-C(sp3)&#8211;H arylation that harnesses the weak coordination affinity of keto groups with the native noncoordinating amide moiety. The current protocol overcomes one of the major challenges associated with the diversification of synthetic modular frameworks of quaternary centers: controlling the mono- vs difunctionalization of chemically equivalent C&#8211;H bonds. The developed condition overrides the interference of the acidic &#945;-hydrogen for possible side reactions of amides and delivers the exclusive formation of the &#947;-monoarylated product. The association of 2-hydroxy pyridine ligands bearing electron-withdrawing substituents demonstrated the best partnership with the Pd&#8211;Ag hetero-bimetallic complex to achieve this distal &#947;-C(sp3)&#8211;H activation of a range of noncoordinating aliphatic amides in the absence of any other exogenous ligand. Here, an array of mechanistic measurements helped us to realize the role of the ligand. A density functional theory (DFT) study was performed on four different computational models to elucidate the working principle of a single pyridone ligand in the absence of any externally installed strong chelating donor motifs. The reaction proceeds sequentially through three primary stages: initial C&#8211;H activation of the &#947;-C(sp3)&#8211;H bond of the amide, succeeded by the oxidative addition of the aryl halide, culminating in reductive elimination, which facilitates the C(sp2)&#8211;C(sp3) coupling between the aryl and the aliphatic amide moieties. The role of the silver salt remained essential not only for successful C&#8211;H activation but also for turning over the catalytic cycle.</description>

                In recent years, significant progress has been achieved in the field of three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs). However, there is still a great challenge to use flexible building units to synthesize high-connectivity 3D COFs. In this work, we showed that [6 + 3] 3D COFs could be constructed by inducing highly flexible planar building blocks from C3 antitriangular prismed 3D building blocks. Herein, two 3D COFs with spn topology based on flexible cyclotriphosphazene units were constructed and denoted as TAA/TAB-CTP-COF, and their redox ability and photophysical features can be finely regulated by the coupled functional group, such as benzene and triazine groups. As a result, the redox heteromotif molecular junction TAA-CTP-COF with fully exposed active sites achieved high photocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) with a yield of 1041 &#956;M h&#8211;1 without any additional photosensitizers, organic scavengers, or cocatalysts. Furthermore, in the presence of an electron donor, the production rate of H2O2 could reach up to 2221 &#956;M h&#8211;1, exhibiting one of the best performances for photocatalytic H2O2 production in the field of crystalline materials. This work showcases the potential of using flexible building blocks in building 3D COFs and highlights the versatility and efficacy of metal-free COFs in solar energy conversion.</description>
