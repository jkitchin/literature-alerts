      <title>Nitrogenation and Oxygenation of an Unstrained C&#8211;C Bond Enabled by the Merger of Visible-Light and Cu-Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05701</link>

                Unstrained carbon&#8211;carbon bonds are among the most prevalent and inert chemical bonds. Thus, developing synthetic transformations directly from unstrained carbon&#8211;carbon bonds under mild conditions is ideal yet challenging due to the inertness and steric hindrance. Here, a visible-light and copper-catalyzed azidation and etherification of a remote and unstrained C&#8211;C bond of amines via 1,4-aryl migration have been reported. This redox-neutral protocol shows exquisite site-selectivity, broad scope, and good functional group tolerance, directly transforming unstrained C&#8211;C bonds to C&#8211;N and C&#8211;O bonds at room temperature. Facile derivatizations of benzyl azide products into free amines, triazoles, and phosphamides highlight the potential utility of this method for target molecule synthesis and medicinal chemistry.</description>

      <title>Flavin-Mediated Photocatalysis Provides a General Platform for Sulfide C&#8211;H Functionalization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05785</link>

                Functionalized sulfides are important in many areas of science, ranging from chemical biology through drug discovery to organic materials chemistry. Sulfides bearing pendant reactive groups in the &#945;-position are particularly useful; however, methods for the selective valorization of simple sulfides or the late-stage functionalization of complex sulfides by the convenient addition of valuable functionality are underexplored. Here we exemplify a general reaction platform for sulfide functionalization by showcasing three modes of &#945;-sulfur C&#8211;H functionalization; cyanation, alkenylation, and alkynylation. Using inexpensive and commercially available riboflavin tetraacetate and visible light, decoration of both feedstock and complex sulfides proceeds in a good yield and with high selectivity. Methionine-containing peptides can also be selectively functionalized and a tolerance screen using amino-acid dopants suggests that the platform is compatible with most amino-acid side chains and thus is a potential tool for bioconjugation.</description>

      <title>Ni-Catalyzed Cyanation of (Hetero)aryl Halides with Acetonitrile as Cyano Source</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05836</link>

                We present a highly efficient method for cyanating challenging substrates with a specific focus on aryl fluorides. This innovative methodology has been successfully expanded to encompass a diverse array of aryl halides, underscoring its versatility and broad applicability. The nickel-catalyzed protocol utilizes acetonitrile under mild temperature conditions, providing a clean and safe alternative for cyanation. Notably, it employs a nonhazardous, nongaseous, metal-free cyanide source and demonstrates a wide substrate scope, accommodating aryl chlorides, fluorides, bromides, and iodides. The reaction is particularly effective with acetonitrile. This catalytic cyanation process serves as a valuable route for synthesizing pharmaceuticals such as letrozole, citalopram, and other NNRTI drugs. Mechanistically, we propose that a catalytic cycle involving zerovalent nickel and divalent nickel is more plausible for this reaction.</description>

                Successful development of catalysts for electrochemical formic acid oxidation (FAO) requires finding an optimal balance between catalytic performance (activity, stability, and selectivity) and catalyst cost. While platinum is one of the most active catalyst materials for FAO, it suffers from performance loss at low overpotentials due to poisoning with CO, which is one of the intermediates formed in the so-called indirect path of FAO. In this work, we explored the synergistic effects of the supporting material and annealing temperature on the performance of Pt thin films for FAO in acidic media. Compared to the as-prepared Pt films, the annealed films show up to 5-fold and 15-fold improvement for FAO on Pt@Ni and Pt@Cr, respectively. While the most active Pt@Ni thin film shows the lowest stability, the most active Pt@Cr thin film is also the most stable, challenging conventional trade-offs in electrocatalysis and providing a promising candidate for FAO nanocatalyst synthesis.</description>

      <title>Selective Catalytic Reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CO by a Single-Site Heterobimetallic Iron&#8211;Potassium Complex Supported on Alumina</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c04989</link>

                CO2 has attracted much attention as a C1 feedstock for synthetic fuels via its selective catalytic hydrogenation to liquid hydrocarbons. One strategy is the catalytic reduction of CO2 to CO through the reverse water&#8211;gas shift (RWGS) reaction, followed by the hydrogenation of CO. In this work, potassium tris(tert-butoxy)ferrate, [{(THF)2KFe(OtBu)3}2], was supported on alumina that had been partially dehydroxylated at 500 &#176;C (Al2O3&#8211;500), and the resulting catalyst was investigated in the selective reduction of CO2 to CO. The active site precursor was identified as [(THF)K(AlsO)Fe(OtBu)2(OHAl)] (i.e., [(THF)KFe(OtBu)2]/Al2O3&#8211;500), denoted 2-K, based on elemental analysis, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Under the reaction conditions, the precursor becomes an active, stable, and selective RWGS catalyst (100% selectivity to CO at 22.5% CO2 conversion). The reaction mechanism was studied by operando DRIFT spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) modeling. The results are consistent with a mechanism involving H2 activation by K[(AlsO)2FeOH], leading to K[(AlsO)2FeH]. CO2 insertion gives hydroxycarbonyl intermediate K[(AlsO)2FeCOOH], followed by liberation of CO to regenerate K[(AlsO)2FeOH].</description>

      <title>Overturning CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Hydrogenation Selectivity via Strong Metal&#8211;Support Interaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05527</link>
      <description>Wenzhe Zhang, Hui Lin, Wei Yao, Xuan Zhou, Yunlei An, Yuanyuan Dai, Qiang Niu, Tiejun Lin, Liangshu Zhong, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391449336

                Strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) is commonly observed for platinum-group metals on reducible oxide supports upon a high-temperature reduction (&#8805;500 &#176;C). Herein, we show that the SMSI state can be constructed over a Ru/anatase-TiO2 catalyst using the CO2 hydrogenation reaction gas at a low temperature of &#8764;210 &#176;C, which could overturn the CO2 hydrogenation selectivity from 100% CH4 to &gt;99% CO. It is revealed that the exposed metallic Ru nanoparticles promote CH4 formation via formate intermediates at temperatures &lt;200 &#176;C. Elevating the temperature under a H2-containing atmosphere causes the evolution of active TiOx suboxide to form an encapsulated structure of Ru@TiOx, which changes the surface intermediate from formate to carboxy species during CO2 hydrogenation, thus leading to exclusive CO formation with long-term catalytic stability. The O2-containing gas treatment of encapsulated Ru@TiOx could achieve the cyclic switch of product selectivity between CO and CH4. This work provides an effective strategy to modulate the SMSI state at a very low temperature.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Theoretical Studies on Cu-Mediated Bond Formation Mechanisms Involving Radicals</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c06042</link>

                Copper-catalyzed radical transformations establish a powerful toolkit to construct versatile complex organic compounds. The copper-mediated bond formation step of radicals plays a critical role in controlling chemo- and stereoselectivity of copper-catalyzed radical transformation reactions. This bond formation step involves three possible pathways: ion-type bond formation, radical substitution, and reductive elimination. This review highlights the recent advances in theoretical studies on mechanisms and controlling models on the selectivity of Cu-mediated radical-involved bond formation, providing a general mechanistic comprehension of this key elementary step in copper catalysis.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Size Effect of Ceria Nanocube-Supported Platinum Nanoparticles in Complete Propane Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c06139</link>
      <description>Shasha Ge, Wei Fan, Xiaoping Tang, Yao Cui, Dong Wang, Xue&#8208;Qing Gong, Sheng Dai, Yang Lou, Jie Tang, Yanglong Guo, Zhan Wang, Li Wang, Yun Guo, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391473249

                The elimination of propane is one of the key tasks in reducing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and automotive exhaust emissions. The platinum nanoparticle (NP) is a promising catalyst for propane oxidation, while the study of its structural characteristics and functionality remains in its infancy. In this work, we synthesized the nanocubes CeO2 with a well-defined (100) facet supporting Pt NPs with various sizes, from 1.3 to 7 nm, and systematically investigated the effect of the Pt size on complete propane oxidation efficiency. In particular, CeO2(100) supported Pt NPs smaller than 4 nm promote the formation of positively charged Pt sites, which hinder the adsorption and activation of propane and reduce the intrinsic activity for propane oxidation. Consequently, within this size range, the catalytic performance is primarily influenced by the electronic state of the Pt species, with metallic Pt being identified as the active site for the reaction. Conversely, as the particle size exceeds 4 nm, metallic Pt particles become dominant and the geometric structure starts to influence the activity as well. Such entanglement of electronic and geometric factors gives rise to a volcano relationship between reaction rates and Pt particle sizes ranging from 1.3 to 7 nm, while an increased correlation can be observed between the turnover frequencies and the particle sizes in this range. This knowledge can guide the synthesis of highly active catalysts, enabling the efficient oxidation of VOCs with reduced precious metal loadings.</description>

      <title>N-Heterocyclic Carbene-Carbodiimide (NHC-CDI) Betaines as Organocatalysts for &#946;-Butyrolactone Polymerization: Synthesis of Green PHB Plasticizers with Tailored Molecular Weights</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05357</link>
      <description>David S&#225;nchez-Roa, Valentina Sessini, Marta E. G. Mosquera, Juan C&#225;mpora, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391473810

                The manufacture of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) stands out as a promising alternative to traditional plastics. This polymer is usually produced by bacteria-based biotechnology or metal-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of &#946;-butyrolactone (&#946;-BL). Nevertheless, commercial PHB suffers from different issues, from poor processability to high production costs. Herein, we report the chemical synthesis of PHB from the ROP of rac-&#946;-butyrolactone promoted by a zwitterionic organocatalyst, an N-heterocyclic carbene-carbodiimide (NHC-CDI) betaine adduct. This reaction has been investigated by a combination of experimental and computational methods. The catalyst cleaves the &#946;-BL via nucleophilic displacement of the C&#8211;O(carboxyl) bond followed by intramolecular elimination to give protonated betaine&#8211;crotonate ion pairs, the active polymerization initiators. Polymer growth is propagated and controlled by these betaine ion pairs, which render amorphous low-molecular-weight PHBs by an unusual mechanism with rapid chain transfer to the monomer regime, analogous to the well-known mechanism of ethylene oligomerization with late transition-metal catalysts. The resulting material is suitable as a biodegradable and biocompatible plasticizer for commercial bacterial or synthetic PHB. Perfect compatibility between the matrix and the additive and a significant reduction of the crystallinity resulted in a more flexible and resilient material.</description>

                Electro-oxidation is a way to utilize glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel production, to produce fuels and feedstock chemicals for the chemical industry. A significant challenge is to get products with high selectivity, so it is desirable to understand the glycerol oxidation mechanisms in further detail. Using density functional theory calculations, we investigated possible glycerol oxidation intermediates on Pt(111) and Ag(111). We find that the different adsorption preferences of the intermediates on Pt (adsorption via carbon atoms) and Ag (adsorption via oxygen atoms) lead to different preferred reaction pathways, resulting in different products. The reaction pathways on both surfaces involve glyceraldehyde as a key intermediate; however, upon further oxidation, Pt(111) preferentially produces glyceric acid (CH2OH&#8211;CHOH&#8211;COOH), while on Ag(111) C&#8211;C bonds are broken, which leads to the production of glycolaldehyde and formic acid (CH2OH&#8211;CHO and HCOOH). These predictions agree well with the experimental outcome of the electro-oxidation of glycerol on Pt and Ag surfaces. Our study therefore provides useful insights for optimizing the selectivity of glycerol oxidation and improving the utilization of glycerol.</description>

                In the present work, we report on a synergistic relationship between platinum nanoparticles and a titanium oxynitride support (TiOxNy/C) in the context of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis. As demonstrated herein, this composite configuration results in significantly improved electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR relative to platinum dispersed on carbon support (Pt/C) at high overpotentials. Specifically, the ORR performance was assessed under an elevated mass transport regime using the modified floating electrode configuration, which enabled us to pursue the reaction closer to PEMFC-relevant current densities. A comprehensive investigation attributes the ORR performance increase to a strong interaction between platinum and the TiOxNy/C support. In particular, according to the generated strain maps obtained via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the Pt-TiOxNy/C analogue exhibits a more localized strain in Pt nanoparticles in comparison to that in the Pt/C sample. The altered Pt structure could explain the measured ORR activity trend via the d-band theory, which lowers the platinum surface coverage with ORR intermediates. In terms of the Pt particle size effect, our observation presents an anomaly as the Pt-TiOxNy/C analogue, despite having almost two times smaller nanoparticles (2.9 nm) compared to the Pt/C benchmark (4.8 nm), manifests higher specific activity. This provides a promising strategy to further lower the Pt loading and increase the ECSA without sacrificing the catalytic activity under fuel cell-relevant potentials. Apart from the ORR, the platinum-TiOxNy/C interaction is of a sufficient magnitude not to follow the typical particle size effect also in the context of other reactions such as CO stripping, hydrogen oxidation reaction, and water discharge. The trend for the latter is ascribed to the lower oxophilicity of Pt-based on electrochemical surface coverage analysis. Namely, a lower surface coverage with oxygenated species is found for the Pt-TiOxNy/C analogue. Further insights were provided by performing a detailed STEM characterization via the identical location mode (IL-STEM) in particular, via 4DSTEM acquisition. This disclosed that Pt particles are partially encapsulated within a thin layer of TiOxNy origin.</description>

      <title>Selective Hydrogenation of Alkyne by Atomically Precise Pd&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; Nanocluster Catalysts: Accurate Construction of the Coplanar and Specific Active Sites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05833</link>

                Atomically precise nanoclusters are promising model catalysts to understand the relationship between structure and catalytic activity. However, designing efficient active sites remains challenging because the highly covered ligands obscure the metal sites. Herein, we reported a Pd6(S-Adm)6(PPh3)(PPh) nanocluster, which shows high selectivity in the semihydrogenation of aromatic alkyne. The Pd6 nanocluster has a unique chair structure, where the pan is composed of the coplanar Pd atoms, the back is composed of two S-Adm ligands, and the legs are composed of four S-Adm, one PPh3, and one PPh ligands. Experiments reveal that the high selectivity of intact Pd6 nanocluster is attributed to the synergistic effect of thiols and phosphines, modulating the electron properties and benefiting the proper hydrogen dissociation ability and desorption of product. Interestingly, it was found that the exposed coplanar Pd atoms could provide specific active sites for the adsorption of C&#8801;C and benzene ring. DFT calculations show that phenylacetylene and styrene adsorb on the coplanar Pd6 much weaker than on the Pd(111) surface, allowing the styrene to be desorbed before further hydrogenation. The phenyl adsorption constrains that the hydrogenation can occur only on the coplanar Pd6, which is more facile for phenylacetylene than for styrene, and results in semihydrogenation.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the Olefin Selectivity in Catalytic Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Light Alkane by the Isolation Strategy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05419</link>

                Olefins are important building blocks that have been extensively used to produce diverse consumer products in petrochemical industry. Owing to the requirement of low-carbon-footprint processes and the increasing use of light alkanes sourced from shale gas, an environmentally friendly and economic route alternative to the state-of-the-art steam cracking of crude oil has been investigated for olefin production. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to olefins has attracted wide attention due to the absence of thermodynamic limitations and coke formation. However, excessive oxidation of olefin is prone to occur in this process. Developing a suitable ODH catalyst with high performance, particularly with enhanced selectivity, is more and more urgent but still remains a challenge. In this Review, we talk about the representative currently developed isolation strategies to optimize the selectivity of olefins via the ODH process, particularly for the conversion of ethane to ethylene, which include the dispersion regulation of metal oxide, the isolation of metal and nonmetal sites, the construction of dual functional sites to isolate dehydrogenation and oxidation steps, and the adoption of selective oxygen species with the promotion of soft oxidants as reactants. Furthermore, the mechanistic aspects about the activation of ethane and the participation of oxygen species for tailoring the selectivity are then classified and discussed in detail. Finally, the perspectives and the emerging technologies for the ODH process are listed and evaluated.</description>

      <title>The Role of Adsorbed Species in 1-Butene Isomerization: Parahydrogen-Induced Polarization NMR of Pd&#8211;Au Catalyzed Butadiene Hydrogenation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05968</link>

                Isomerization of 1-butene critically influences product distributions in 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation. However, distinguishing between the isomerization and hydrogenation pathways is challenging. Here, we employ parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) NMR spectroscopy to determine the extent of the isomerization pathway when using Pd&#8211;Au bimetallic nanoparticles synthesized via a colloidal protocol in the presence or absence of a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) stabilizing ligand and immobilized on TiO2. Residual additives, in particular, sulfur, are observed to considerably influence the pairwise hydrogenation and 1-butene isomerization pathways. PHIP NMR analysis reveals that the PVP ligand can induce strong polarized signals, likely due to restricted proton migration, but minimally impact 1-butene isomerization. In contrast, removing surface sulfur species introduced during catalyst synthesis profoundly enhances 1-butene isomerization by reducing the hydrogen concentration at the nanoparticle surface. This work elucidates how residual species can modulate key reaction pathways such as isomerization during 1,3-butadiene hydrogenation, with implications for rational catalyst design.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Metal-Ion-Doped Carbon Nitrides for Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05961</link>
      <description>Shanping Liu, Valent&#237;n D&#237;ez-Cabanes, Dong Fan, Peixiang Lu, Yuanxing Fang, Markus Antonietti, Guillaume Maurin, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391486029

                Poly(heptazine imides) (PHIs) have emerged as prominent layered carbon nitride-based materials with potential oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity owing to their strong VIS light absorption, long excited-state lifetimes, high surface-to-volume ratios, and the possibility of tuning their properties via hosting different metal ions in their pores. A series of metal-ion-doped PHI-M (M = K+, Rb+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and Co2+) were first systematically explored using density functional theory calculations. These simulations led an in-depth understanding of the microscopic OER mechanism in these systems and identified PHI-Co2+ as the best OER catalyst of this family of PHIs, whereas PHI-Mn2+ can be an alternative promising OER catalyst. This level of performance was attributed to a thermodynamically favorable formation of the reaction intermediates as well as its red-shifted absorption in the VIS region involving the population of long-lived states, as revealed by time-dependent density functional theory calculations. We further demonstrated that the electronic properties of the *OH intermediates (Bader population, crystal orbital Hamilton population analysis, and adsorption energies) are reliable descriptors to anticipate the OER activity of this family of PHIs. This rational analysis paved the way toward the prediction of the OER performance of another PHI-M derivative, i.e., PHI-Fe2+. The computationally explored PHI-Fe2+, PHI-Mn2+, and PHI-Co2+ systems were then synthesized alongside PHI-K+, and their photocatalytic OER activities were assessed. These experimental findings confirmed the best photocatalytic OER performance for PHI-Co2+ with an oxygen production of 31.2 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8211;1 that is 60 times higher than the pristine g-C3N4 (0.5 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8211;1), whereas PHI-Fe2+ and PHI-Mn2+ are seen as alternative OER catalysts with attractive oxygen production of 11.20 and 4.69 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8211;1, respectively. Decisively, this joint experimental&#8211;computational study reveals PHI-Co2+ to be among the best of the OER catalysts so far reported in the literature including some perovskites.</description>

      <title>Highly Selective Upgrading of Polyethylene into Light Aromatics via a Low-Temperature Melting-Catalysis Strategy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05098</link>
      <description>Zhe Zhang, Huan Chen, Guixiang Li, Weigang Hu, Bo Niu, Donghui Long, Yayun Zhang, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391486048

                The selective upgrading of polyethylene waste into light aromatics is hampered by relatively high C&#8211;C bond cleavage temperatures and low product selectivity. Herein, we report a low-temperature melting-catalysis strategy that directly upgrades low-density polyethylene (LDPE) into light aromatics over commercial ZSM-5 zeolite under mild conditions, eliminating the need for precious metals, solvent, or external H2. Experimental results combined with DFT calculations and molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the molten LDPE microenvironment facilitates intimate LDPE-catalyst contact, promoting primary C&#8211;C cleavage while suppressing olefin intermediates diffusion out of pores. This feature increases the residence time for subsequent direct olefin cyclization within the confined micropores. Moreover, online mass spectra confirmed that the in situ generated hydrogen from cyclization and dehydroaromatization reactions plays a vital role in C&#8211;C bond scission. By optimizing the reaction conditions, a light aromatic yield of 50.6 wt % with an impressive selectivity of 90.9% toward benzene, toluene, and xylenes was achieved at 280 &#176;C for 1 h. This strategy is not limited to the model polyethylene but also demonstrates remarkable efficiency in the depolymerization of various widely used polyethylene-rich plastics, enabling an economically viable and environmentally benign chemical recycling path for plastic wastes.</description>

                Modern organic synthesis requires methodologies that bring together abundant feedstock chemicals in a mild and efficient manner. To aid in this effort, we have developed a multicomponent radical hydroxyarylation reaction that utilizes aryl halides, olefins, and O2 as the reaction components. Crucial to this advance was an oxidative, rather than a reductive, approach to aryl radical generation, which enables reaction tolerance to O2. This methodology displays a broad functional group tolerance with a variety of functionalized aryl halides and a broad array of olefins. Development of this methodology enables rapid access to biologically relevant hydroxyaryl products from simple, commercially available starting materials.</description>
