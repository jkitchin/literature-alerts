                Abstract Ammonia is an essential commodity in the food and chemical industry. Despite the energy&#8208;intensive nature, the Haber&#8211;Bosch process is the only player in ammonia production at large scales. Developing other strategies is highly desirable, as sustainable and decentralized ammonia production is crucial. Electrochemical ammonia production by directly reducing nitrogen and nitrogen&#8208;based moieties powered by renewable energy sources holds great potential. However, low ammonia production and selectivity rates hamper its utilization as a large&#8208;scale ammonia production process. Creating effective and selective catalysts for the electrochemical generation of ammonia is critical for long&#8208;term nitrogen fixation. Single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) have become a new class of materials with distinctive features that may be able to solve some of the problems with conventional heterogeneous catalysts. The design and optimization of SAAs for electrochemical ammonia generation have recently been significantly advanced. This comprehensive review discusses these advancements from theoretical and experimental research perspectives, offering a fundamental understanding of the development of SAAs for ammonia production.</description>

      <title>Controlled doping of ultralow amounts Ru on Ni cathode for PEMWE: Experimental and theoretical elucidation of enhanced performance</title>

                Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is an environmentally benign technology for large-scale hydrogen production. Despite many catalysts being developed to replace Pt, successful development of low-cost catalysts that meet the balance of performance and durability is limited. In this work, atomically dispersed Ru on Ni catalyst-integrated porous transport electrodes were fabricated by a simple electrodeposition. With a trace amount of Ru (&lt; 0.05 mgRu&#183;cm&#8722;2), the Ni98.1Ru1.9 cathode catalyst exhibited an overpotential of 35 mV at &#8211;10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 with excellent stability. Density functional theory calculation revealed that the high performance was driven by optimized adsorption strength and improved mobility of hydrogen on the catalyst surface. The Ni98.1Ru1.9 electrode was further verified in a PEMWE cell and resulting performance (6.0 A&#183;cm&#8722;2 at 2.25 Vcell) and stability (0.13 mV&#183;h&#8722;1 decay rate at 1 A&#183;cm&#8722;2) surpassed previously reported non-Pt and even Pt electrodes, demonstrating its readiness as an advanced cathode to replace Pt.</description>

      <title>Constructing highly efficient bifunctional catalysts for oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution by modifying MXene with transition metal</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.01.089</link>

                Exploring highly active electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has become a growing interest in recent years. Herein, an efficient pathway for designing MXene-based ORR/OER catalysts is proposed. It involves introducing non-noble metals into Vo (vacancy site), H1 and H2 (the hollow sites on top of C and the metal atom, respectively) sites on M2CO2 surfaces, named TM-VO/H1/H2-M2CO2 (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, M = V, Nb, Ta). Among these recombination catalysts, Co-H1-V2CO2 and Ni-H1-V2CO2 exhibit the most promising ORR catalytic activities, with low overpotential values of 0.35 and 0.37 V, respectively. Similarly, Fe-H1-V2CO2, Co-VO-Nb2CO2, and Ni-H2-Nb2CO2 possess low OER overpotential values of 0.29, 0.39, and 0.44 V, respectively, suggesting they have enormous potential as effective catalysts for OER. Notably, Co-H2-Ta2CO2 possesses the lowest potential gap value of 0.53 V, demonstrating it has an extraordinary bifunctional catalytic activity. The excellent catalytic performance of these recombination catalysts can be elucidated through an electronic structure analysis, which primarily relies on the electron-donating capacity and synergistic effects between transition metals and sub-metals. These results provide theoretical guidance for designing new ORR and OER catalysts using 2D MXene materials.</description>

      <title>The enhanced electro/photocatalytic activity for nitric oxide reduction to ammonia by B@g-C9N10 monolayer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matchemphys.2024.128914</link>
      <description>Min Wang, Yuhong Huang, Haiping Lin, Haili Zhao, Fang Ma, Jianmin Zhang, Xiumei Wei, Materials Chemistry and Physics. 315(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391063548

                Selective electro/photocatalytic reduction of nitride oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH3) provides a promising way to remove the pollutant under ambient conditions. The key to NO reduction reaction (NORR) is to develop more economical and efficient electrocatalysts compared to the industrialized Pt-based catalysts. In this work, the boron atom doping g-C9N10 monolayer (B@g-C9N10) is designed and the electro/photocatalytic NORR performance is systematically investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT). Among the N-end, O-end and side-on structures, the N-end NO adsorption is found to be the most stable one, which greatly favors the NO activation by the &#8220;&#963;-donation and &#960;* back-donation&#8221; mechanism. Among the N-distal, N-alternating, O-distal, O-alternating, Mixed 1&#8211;3 hydrogenation pathways in the electrocatalytic process, the O-alternating and Mixed-2 pathways are the most efficient NORR routes, which have the same limiting potential (UL) of &#8722;0.386 V in the step of *NH2&#8594;*NH3. However, the NO molecule is more easily activated in *N&#8211;OH along O-alternating pathway than Mixed-2 pathway. The energy barrier can be further decreased by considering the implicit and explicit solvation model and the NH3 selectivity of B@g-C9N10 is higher than N2O, N2 and H2. The irradiating energy of 1.094 eV can decrease the reaction energy, resulting in the spontaneous NORR process along Mixed-2 pathway. Our findings uncover a promising approach to design a bifunctional NORR electro/photocatalyst with high NH3 selectivity and activity NO&#8594;NH3 conversion.</description>

      <title>Representative longevity testing of direct air capture materials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.148901</link>
      <description>Russell A. Hunt, Jeremy Gillbanks, Jason P. Czapla, Zhijian Wan, Caleb Karmelich, Cameron White, Colin D. Wood, Chemical Engineering Journal. 481(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391064300

                Direct-air CO2 capture (DAC) is a rapidly expanding field of research driven by a growing need for net-negative technologies. One leading class of materials for DAC is amine-based adsorbents, however these may have limited lifetime due to oxidative degradation. Material longevity is a critical parameter; however, most studies test the stability of these materials under inert atmospheres, removing the oxidation pathway. Consequently, more realistic longevity testing is needed. This work presents a method using ambient air and partial vacuum conditions to assess the stability of DAC materials realistically. A custom-built, automated system was developed whereby CO2 adsorption was conducted in ambient air and desorption under vacuum. In this study, the novel method presented here is compared to a TGA method for analysis of the commercial ion exchange resin Lewatit VP OC 1065. A novel crosslinked polyamine designated here as CA-1 is also examined using the system under various conditions. The method involves the measurement and re-measurement of adsorption capacity between adsorption/desorption cycles. The Lewatit resin was cycled 180 times with desorption at 80 &#176;C and 100 mbar absolute. In this test, it lost 31.20 % of original capacity, contrasted with a 5.47 % loss from the inert TGA method. The CA-1 crosslinked polyamine was then cycled 500 times at three sets of desorption conditions: 80 &#176;C and atmospheric pressure, 80 &#176;C and 500 mbar absolute, and 75 &#176;C and 200 mbar absolute. The sample at 200 mbar lost only 2.79 % original uptake, compared to 28.74 % in atmospheric pressure.</description>

                The socio-economic advancements have led to the emergence of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which have had a profound influence on ecosystems and climate change. This review focuses on CO2 Electrochemical Reduction (CO2-ECR), a new technology with significant potential for reducing CO2 emissions through the optimal use of renewable resources. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to develop catalysts that are both effective and efficient in order to improve the efficiency of CO2-ECR for the production of desired products. Zeolitic imidazolidine frameworks (ZIFs) have gained significant attention in the field of CO2-ECR due to their significant surface area and presence of active sites. ZIFs, which consist of imidazole organic linkers and a variety of metals, are tunable with respect to their electrochemical activity and properties, thereby affecting the selectivity of CO2-ECR. This review elucidates ZIFs as CO2-ECR electrocatalysts, encompassing ligand modifications, metal variations, and different reaction conditions, contributing to the quest for efficient solutions in mitigating CO2 concentration and achieving carbon neutrality. Researchers have extensively studied operational conditions impacting these materials. Technology utilization further aids in explaining experimental observations. This review has significant potential for application in studying and fabrication of electrocatalytic ZIFs-based materials that are effective for academic and industrial research and development.</description>

      <title>A unique adsorption-diffusion-decomposition mechanism for hydrogen evolution reaction towards high-efficiency Cr, Fe-modified CoP nanorod catalyst</title>

                The rational construction of high-efficiency transition metal phosphides catalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is crucial since their sluggish kinetics of water dissociation remain severe barriers for HER performance. The theoretical calculations indicate a unique adsorption-diffusion-decomposition mechanism for H2O molecules on CoP (111) surface. Herein, Fe could decrease H2O decomposition barrier energies and increase the amount of active sites, along with Cr could accelerate H2O adsorption, diffusion and increase the conductivity of the reaction surface. Aided by this mechanism, a self-supported electrode of Cr and Fe dual-doped CoP nanorod arrays grown on nickel foam was prepared. The electrode only requires an overpotential of 27 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for alkaline HER with excellent durability for 400 h. Moreover, the catalyst presents only 1.505 V at 10 mA cm-2 for alkaline water electrolysis. This work provides an in-depth understanding on catalytic mechanism of CoP-based materials.</description>

      <title>First principle investigation of nitric oxide reduction reaction for efficient ammonia synthesis over a Fe&#8211;Mo dual-atom electrocatalyst</title>

                Electrocatalytic conversion of NO-to-NH3 holds immense potential for removing contaminants and producing zero-carbon fuel. To facilitate widespread commercial adoption of this technology, electrocatalysts with exceptional stability, high activity, and selective performance are urgently desired. We developed a novel dual-atom electrocatalyst, Fe&#8211;Mo@NG, in which Fe&#8211;Mo dimer is anchored to N-doped graphite. Through the first principle calculations, it is discovered that Fe&#8211;Mo@NG provided exceptional performance in NO-to-NH3 conversion. The parallel adsorption type was found can maximize the activation of NO. And the most favorable adsorption structure exhibits a limiting potential of &#8722;0.26 eV, surpassing that of most conventional electrocatalysts. The remarkable NORR activity of Fe&#8211;Mo@NG is traced back the synergistic effect between the dual-atom active site and the electronic interactions between the active site and NO. At high coverages, the interaction between intermediates and free NO molecules may lead to the formation of N2 or N2O. Overall, our research introduces a promising dual-atom electrocatalyst with broad applicability in NO reduction reactions, providing novel insights into the dual-atom catalysts design.</description>

      <title>RuO2 Catalysts for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution in Acidic Media: Mechanism, Activity Promotion Strategy and Research Progress</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29020537</link>
      <description>Jirong Bai, Wei Zhou, Jingliang Xu, Quanfa Zhou, Yaoyao Deng, Mei Xiang, Dongsheng Xiang, Yaqiong Su, Molecules. 29(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391089701

                Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis (PEMWE) under acidic conditions outperforms alkaline water electrolysis in terms of less resistance loss, higher current density, and higher produced hydrogen purity, which make it more economical in long-term applications. However, the efficiency of PEMWE is severely limited by the slow kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), poor catalyst stability, and high cost. Therefore, researchers in the past decade have made great efforts to explore cheap, efficient, and stable electrode materials. Among them, the RuO2 electrocatalyst has been proved to be a major promising alternative to Ir-based catalysts and the most promising OER catalyst owing to its excellent electrocatalytic activity and high pH adaptability. In this review, we elaborate two reaction mechanisms of OER (lattice oxygen mechanism and adsorbate evolution mechanism), comprehensively summarize and discuss the recently reported RuO2-based OER electrocatalysts under acidic conditions, and propose many advanced modification strategies to further improve the activity and stability of RuO2-based electrocatalytic OER. Finally, we provide suggestions for overcoming the challenges faced by RuO2 electrocatalysts in practical applications and make prospects for future research. This review provides perspectives and guidance for the rational design of highly active and stable acidic OER electrocatalysts based on PEMWE.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Hydrogenation Selectivity of an Unsaturated Aldehyde via Single-Atom Alloy Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c10994</link>
      <description>Hio Tong Ngan, Philippe Sautet, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391091852

                Selective hydrogenation of &#945;,&#946;-unsaturated aldehydes to produce unsaturated alcohols remains a challenge in catalysis. Here, we explore, on the basis of first-principles simulations, single-atom alloy (SAA) catalysts on copper as a class of catalytic materials to enhance the selectivity for C&#9552;O bond hydrogenation in unsaturated aldehydes by controlling the binding strength of the C&#9552;C and C&#9552;O bonds. We show that on SAA of early transition metals such as Ti, Zr, and Hf, the C&#9552;O binding mode of acrolein is favored but the strong binding renders subsequent hydrogenation and desorption impossible. On SAA of late-transition metals, on the other hand, the C&#9552;C binding mode is favored and C&#9552;C bond hydrogenation follows, resulting in the production of undesired saturated aldehydes. Mid-transition metals (Cr and Mn) in Cu(111) appear as the optimal systems, since they favor acrolein adsorption via the C&#9552;O bond but with a moderate binding strength, compatible with catalysis. Additionally, acrolein migration from the C&#9552;O to the C&#9552;C binding mode, which would open the low energy path for C&#9552;C bond hydrogenation, is prevented by a large barrier for this process. SAA of Cr in Cu appears as an optimal candidate, and kinetic simulations show that the selectivity for propenol formation is controlled by preventing the acrolein migration from the more stable C&#9552;O to the less stable C&#9552;C binding mode and subsequent H-migration and by the formation of the O-H bond from the monohydrogenated intermediate. Dilute alloy catalysts therefore enable tuning the binding strength of intermediates and transition states, opening control of catalytic activity and selectivity.</description>

      <title>Atomic Single-Layer Ir Clusters Enabling 100% Selective Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05738</link>

                The exclusive selectivity of the chlorine evolution reaction (CER) is crucial for the chlor-alkali industry to obtain pure chlorine gas and avoid the cost of separating the byproduct oxygen. However, 100% CER selectivity remains a challenge for the currently known CER catalysts. Here, we report a catalyst of atomic single-layer Ir clusters on CeO2 nanorods (IrSL/CeO2). Under the strong metal/support interaction, IrSL has a strong adsorption to oxygen, thereby suppressing the oxygen evolution reaction. Coupled with the uniform active sites of the single-layer Ir clusters, IrSL/CeO2 achieves almost 100% CER selectivity in acidic NaCl solution ranging from open circuit potential to practical current density levels. In addition, IrSL/CeO2 exhibits 1.7 times higher catalytic activity than its single-atom counterparts, and its noble metal efficiency is 84 times higher than that of commercial anodes (DSAs). Our finding provides a solution to the selective catalysis of chlor-alkali electrolysis.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Agreement of Binuclear 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Sites for Superior Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>

                This work analyzes the bifunctional activity of a binuclear two-dimensional metal&#8211;organic framework fragment (2D-SA) utilizing ab initio spin-polarized density functional theory calculations. Cobalt, iron, and a combination of the two metals were simulated due to their history with promising oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER) activity. The favorable reaction pathways of both the ORR and OER have been realized including the addition of pristine/doped graphene substrate. The Co-2D-SAs had the best performance toward OER only, while the Fe-2D-SAs were favorable toward ORR. The results show that when the bimetallic Co/Fe-2D-SA was supported by graphene, both the ORR overpotential of the Fe site and the OER overpotential of the Co site were found to be the best for the bifunctional activity. This superior bifunctional activity is attributed to both the substrate effect and cooperative agreement between iron and cobalt in the bimetallic 2D-SA by adjusting their spin states due to the antiferromagnetic coupling of the binuclear sites.</description>

      <title>Regulating Cation Disorder Triggered-Electronic Reshuffling for Sustainable Conventional Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemmater.3c02219</link>

                Unraveling the underlying thermodynamic principles governing the sustainable conventional layered cathodes at the electron-scale remains a critical challenge, yet it is essential for advancing Li-ion batteries toward a high energy density future. In this context, the layered LixNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 is taken as an example to disclose the intricate connection among the structural disorders, electronic transfer, redox chemistry, and performance degradation using ab initio calculations. During cation disordering, the dramatic picture of electronic reshuffling is sculpted by the appearance of electron trapping centers/parasitic holes in the local TM-rich domain, as well as the O:2p lone-pairs in the local Li-rich domain. Distinct redox processes emerge wherein the parasitic holes can effectively couple with the adjacent transition metal (TM:d electron) and/or the oxygen ions (O:2p lone-pairs) depending on the states of charge. Regarding the structural stability, the electronic reshuffling induces a reciprocal relationship between cation disorder and oxygen stability, posing a concealed threat of reversibility. A new self-sustaining process is conceived as the primary pathway for severe layered damages and degradation. Notably, the cation disorder triggered-electronic reshuffling exhibits strict regularity that depends on the relative energies of the TM:d and O:2p states, holding promise for the reasonable design of sustainable layered cathodes. The theoretical framework provides a novel and self-consistent description of the thermodynamic conditions toward the reversible electrochemical process for conventional layered cathodes.</description>

      <title>P&#8208;Incorporation Induced Enhancement of Lattice Oxygen Participation in Double Perovskite Oxides to Boost Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202309091</link>
      <description>Gaoliang Fu, Leilei Zhang, Ruixue Wei, Huili Liu, Ruipeng Hou, Yue Zhang, Kun Yang, Shouren Zhang, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391108255

                Abstract Activating the lattice oxygen in the catalysts to participate in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which can break the scaling relation&#8211;induced overpotential limitation (&gt; 0.37 V) of the adsorbate evolution mechanism, has emerged as a new and highly effective guide to accelerate the OER. However, how to increase the lattice oxygen participation of catalysts during OER remains a major challenge. Herein, P&#8208;incorporation induced enhancement of lattice oxygen participation in double perovskite LaNi 0.58 Fe 0.38 P 0.07 O 3&#8208;&#963; (PLNFO) is studied. P&#8208;incorporation is found to be crucial for enhancing the OER activity. The current density reaches 1.35 mA cm ECSA &#8722;2 at 1.63 V (vs RHE), achieving a sixfold increase in intrinsic activity. Experimental evidences confirm the dominant lattice oxygen participation mechanism (LOM) for OER pathway on PLNFO. Further electronic structures reveal that P&#8208;incorporation shifts the O p &#8208;band center by 0.7 eV toward the Fermi level, making the states near the Fermi level more O p character, thus facilitating LOM and fast OER kinetics. This work offers a possible method to develop high&#8208;performance double perovskite OER catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.</description>

      <title>Self-Assembled Nanotubes Based on Chiral H8-BINOL Modified with 1,2,3-Triazole to Recognize Bi3+ Efficiently by ICT Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/mi15010163</link>
      <description>Jon Tao, Fang Guo, Yue Sun, Xiaoxia Sun, Yu Hu, Micromachines. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391110434

                A novel fluorescent &#8220;off&#8221; probe R-&#946;-D-1 containing a 1,2,3-triazole moiety was obtained by the Click reaction with azidoglucose using H8-BINOL as a substrate, and the structure was characterized by 1H NMR and 13C NMR and ESI-MS analysis. The fluorescence properties of R-&#946;-D-1 in methanol were investigated, and it was found that R-&#946;-D-1 could be selectively fluorescently quenched by Bi3+ in the recognition of 19 metal ions and basic cations. The recognition process of Bi3+ by R-&#946;-D-1 was also investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy, SEM, AFM, etc. The complex pattern of R-&#946;-D-1 with Bi3+ was determined by Job&#8217;s curve as 1 + 1, and the binding constant Ka of R-&#946;-D-1 and Bi3+ was valued by the Benesi&#8211;Hildebrand equation as 1.01 &#215; 104 M&#8722;1, indicating that the binding force of R-&#946;-D-1 and Bi3+ was medium. The lowest detection limit (LOD) of the self-assembled H8-BINOL derivative for Bi3+ was up to 0.065 &#181;M. The mechanism for the recognition of Bi3+ by the sensor R-&#946;-D-1 may be the intramolecular charge transfer effect (ICT), which was attributed to the fact that the N-3 of the triazole readily serves as an electron acceptor while the incorporation of Bi3+ serves as an electron donor, and the two readily undergo coordination leading to the quenching of fluorescence. The recognition mechanism and recognition site could be verified by DFT calculation and CDD (Charge Density Difference).</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity of Sputtered Ni, NiO, and NiNiO Thin Films by Incorporating Fe</title>

                Abstract The effect of Fe&#8208;containing alkaline electrolyte, on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of Ni electrocatalysts, has long been of interest as Fe increases the OER activity of Ni electrocatalysts. However, controversy exists as to whether it is surface or bulk Fe that is responsible for the increased activity. In this study, magnetron sputtering was employed to sputter Ni, NiO and NiNiO thin film electrocatalysts to study the effect that different concentrations of Fe in the electrolyte have on their OER activities. It was found that increasing concentrations of Fe increasingly enhanced the OER activity of these thin film electrocatalysts until the electrolyte was saturated with Fe. The lowest overpotential achieved is 279 mV (at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) for NiNiO cycled in KOH containing 1 mM Fe, with all three thin film electrocatalysts exhibiting overpotentials within the same range after 30 voltammetry cycles in 0.9 ppm Fe and 1 mM Fe. All Tafel slopes are between 36 and 45 mV dec &#8722;1 indicating similar kinetics for the samples cycled in different Fe concentrations. Energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy results show that Fe is found in the top layers of the electrocatalysts after cycling.</description>

                Producing valuable fuel-ranged hydrocarbons from cellulosic biomass is an effective approach to addressing potential energy issues. However, the cellulosic-derived bio-oil may contain carboxylic acid components that contribute to the unfavorable acidic and corrosive nature, which necessitates upgrading through the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) treatment using heterogeneous catalysis. Here, we performed reactive force-field molecular dynamics (ReaxFF-MD) to study the hydrogenolysis, dehydrogenation and decarboxylation mechanisms of the acetic acid model compound on the Ni-based catalyst. Comparative analysis of the activation of C&#8211;O and C = O bonds was presented, followed by an examination of the associative desorption of H2 and the dynamic evolution of main intermediates. Furthermore, the conversion pathways of key intermediates were determined and four main pathways for ethanol generation and the temperature-response mechanism for coking formation were proposed. This mechanism diagram explains the strong effects of a hydrogen environment in biomass-related reactions, highlighting the dynamic mechanism of selective hydrogenation and deoxygenation of carbon&#8211;oxygen bonds.</description>

      <title>Theoretical insights of penta-M2N4 for oxygen reduction electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2024.159445</link>
      <description>Yandong Ma, Fangfang Zheng, Yuyan Liu, Yujin Ji, Youyong Li, Applied Surface Science. 654(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391115580

                The excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of the nitrogen-coordinated metal site (the &#8220;MN4&#8221; site) makes them promising candidates. Hence, extending a similar family is of great importance for the development of the ORR catalysts. In this work, we investigate ten penta-M2N4 (M = Ni, Pd, Pt, or Rh) by considering their stability, activity, and selectivity for the ORR performance based on first-principles calculations. Our results show that all the penta-M2N4 (p-M2N4) are dynamically and thermally stable and are promising for synthesis and application in the ORR. The 2e&#8722; ORR process overpotentials of p-NiPdN4 (Ni site) and p-PdRhN4 (Pd site) are estimated to be 0.07 V and 0.14 V, respectively, showing comparable activities to the well-known CoN4-C. For the 4e&#8722; ORR, p-Rh2N4 (Rh site), p-NiRhN4 (Ni site), and p-PdRhN4 (Rh site) are identified as candidates with excellent ORR performance. Moreover, a structure&#8211;activity relationship between the electronic properties and the catalytic performance is established, and the orbital hybridization induced by alloying plays a crucial role in modulating the selectivity in ORR. Our study provides valuable insights for the design of ORR catalysts.</description>

                Carbon-based single-atom catalysts, a promising candidate in electrocatalysis, offer insights into electron-donating effects of metal center on adjacent atoms. Herein, we present a practical strategy to rationally design a model catalyst with a single zinc (Zn) atom coordinated with nitrogen and sulfur atoms in a multilevel carbon matrix. The Zn site exhibits an atomic interface configuration of ZnN 4 S 1 , where Zn's electron injection effect enables thermal-neutral hydrogen adsorption on neighboring atoms, pushing the activity boundaries of carbon electrocatalysts toward electrochemical hydrogen evolution to an unprecedented level. Experimental and theoretical analyses confirm the low-barrier Volmer&#8211;Tafel mechanism of proton reduction, while the multishell hollow structures facilitate the hydrogen evolution even at high current intensities. This work provides insights for understanding the actual active species during hydrogen evolution reaction and paves the way for designing high-performance electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Vision for unified micromagnetic modeling (UMM) with Ubermag</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/9.0000661</link>
      <description>Hans Fangohr, Martin Lang, Samuel Holt, Swapneel Amit Pathak, Kauser Zulfiqar, Marijan Beg, AIP Advances. 14(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391134653

                Scientists who want to use micromagnetic simulation packages, need to learn how to express the micromagnetic problem of interest in a &#8220;language&#8221; such as a configuration file, script or GUI-clicks that the simulation software understands. This language varies from software to software. If the researchers need to use another package, they need to learn a new language to re-express their (unchanged) micromagnetic problem for the next software. For research-project specific pre- or post-processing, scientists often need to write additional software. We propose the vision of a unified micromagnetic modeling (UMM) approach with which researchers can express the micromagnetic problem once and from which multiple simulation packages can be instructed automatically to carry out the actual numerical problem solving. Furthermore, by providing defined interfaces that are embedded in the Python data science ecosystem and which are used to communicate with the simulation packages, we can create an open research framework in which simulation runs and additional computation can be arbitrarily combined and orchestrated. Where analysis tools are missing from simulators, these can conveniently be created at Python level. Advantages of this approach include reduced effort for scientists to familiarize themselves with multiple simulation configuration languages, easier exploitation of complementary features of the different simulation packages, the ability to compare results computed with different simulation packages more easily, and the option to easily extend analysis functionality of the existing simulators. With recent updates of Ubermag we present a prototype of such a UMM framework. Ubermag provides a unified interface (expressed in Python) to solve micromagnetic problems using, currently, OOMMF and mumax3. After a simulation has finished, the results are made available to the researcher for analysis within the Python ecosystem of scientific and data science libraries. We discuss the current state of capabilities and challenges associated with the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Highly Active Porous Mo2C-Mo2N Heterostructure on Carbon Nanowalls/Diamond for a High-Current Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/nano14030243</link>

                Developing non-precious metal-based electrocatalysts operating in high-current densities is highly demanded for the industry-level electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we report the facile preparation of binder-free Mo2C-Mo2N heterostructures on carbon nanowalls/diamond (CNWs/D) via ultrasonic soaking followed by an annealing treatment. The experimental investigations and density functional theory calculations reveal the downshift of the d-band center caused by the heterojunction between Mo2C/Mo2N triggering highly active interfacial sites with a nearly zero &#8710;GH* value. Furthermore, the 3D-networked CNWs/D, as the current collector, features high electrical conductivity and large surface area, greatly boosting the electron transfer rate of HER occurring on the interfacial sites of Mo2C-Mo2N. Consequently, the self-supporting Mo2C-Mo2N@CNWs/D exhibits significantly low overpotentials of 137.8 and 194.4 mV at high current densities of 500 and 1000 mA/cm2, respectively, in an alkaline solution, which far surpass the benchmark Pt/C (228.5 and 359.3 mV) and are superior to most transition-metal-based materials. This work presents a cost-effective and high-efficiency non-precious metal-based electrocatalyst candidate for the electrochemical hydrogen production industry.</description>

      <title>NH3 decomposition in autothermal microchannel reactors</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-88503-4.00003-x</link>

                The focus of this chapter is on the breakdown of ammonia intending to produce hydrogen as the cleanest source of energy. A review of microreactors and related technical literature is first collected. Then, the chemical mechanism of two coupled reactions (combustion and decomposition) are discussed. These two reactions are essentially underway in the same coupled microchannels. An autothermal plug-flow reactor for NH3 decomposition is a type of chemical reactor that utilizes a catalytic process to convert ammonia (NH3) into nitrogen (N2) and hydrogen (H2). This reaction is important in the production of hydrogen for fuel cells, as well as in the removal of ammonia from industrial waste streams. The autothermal plug-flow reactor is particularly useful for this reaction because it allows for both exothermic and endothermic reactions to occur simultaneously, without the need for external heating or cooling. The reactor design includes an annular region on the outside of a microchannel containing the catalyst, which allows for efficient heat transfer and mass transfer. The main effective parameters for this type of reactor include temperature, pressure, flow rate, catalyst type and loading, reactant concentration, reactor geometry, and inlet temperature and composition. By optimizing these parameters, the efficiency, selectivity, and yield of the NH3 decomposition reaction can be improved.</description>

      <title>Comparative Performance Evaluation of Absorbents for the Electrowinning-Coupled Competitive Separation CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture Process</title>

                Electrowinning-coupled competitive separation (ECCS) CO2 capture technology, utilizing renewable electricity as the energy input, is regarded as a promising electrochemically mediated CO2 capture approach to substitute for the traditional solvent-based CO2 scrubbing method. However, this technology is still distant from practical application due to its energy-intensive property, sensitivity to oxygen, amine degradation, and system complexity. The selection of a suitable solvent plays a crucial role in enhancing the overall performance and scalability of the ECCS system. To address an efficient solvent screening method, this paper proposed a systematic comparison of solvents in terms of thermodynamics, electrochemistry, absorption, and desorption performance. The proposed solvent screening method undergoes a critical evaluation through the development of a thermodynamic model and experimentation. Using MEA, EDA, and NH3 as examples (solvents extensively discussed in the ECCS system), the paper provides a comprehensive discussion of the solvent screening method. Results indicate that EDA exhibits superior CO2 absorption and thermodynamic performance. NH3 solvent demonstrates better CO2 desorption and electrochemical performance. However, there is an antithetical relationship between the thermodynamic and electrochemical performance. This phenomenon arises because the Cu2+&#8211;solvent complex, characterized by a stronger coupling performance, is more stable, necessitating a higher potential to reduce the Cu2+&#8211;solvent complex. This leads to increased energy consumption during the solvent regeneration process. Therefore, when solvent screening is conducted, it is essential to categorize and thoroughly consider thermodynamics, electrochemistry, and absorption and desorption performance.</description>

      <title>Systematic screening of transition-metal-doped hydroxyapatite for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcou.2024.102692</link>
      <description>Yuting Li, Daniel Baham&#243;n, Josep Albero, N&#250;ria L&#243;pez, Lourdes F. Vega, Journal of CO2 Utilization. 80(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391448738

                We present the first comprehensive investigation of transition metal-substituted Hydroxyapatite (TM-HAP) materials for photocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR). Density functional theory (DFT) was used to study in a systematic manner the stability of 3d, 4d, 5d transition metal dopants on the HAP (000&#773;1) surface, analyzing their stability, activity, and selectivity for photocatalytic CO2RR. DFT results allowed to narrow down the selection to three transition metal elements (Co, Ni, Mo) based on their structural stability, band structure and performance. A selective analysis of product formation for carbon monoxide and formate was made, showing that TM dopants facilitate the initial protonation step in the CO2 reduction by adsorbing H2 molecule on TM atoms and then dissociating it into two hydrogen atoms. The performance of Ni- and Co-HAP towards the reaction activity is consistent with experimental results. Mo-HAP stands as a new and attractive photocatalyst for further investigation, given its excellent predicted performance.</description>

                Electrochemical membrane technology has been identified as a promising technology for sustainable chemical and energy production due to its potential to address several challenges in the production of chemicals and energy, including energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste generation. Electrochemical membrane processes can be applied to produce a wide range of feedstocks, including gases, liquids, and solids. This versatility can enable the coproduction of multiple chemicals and energy products from various feedstocks. In this chapter, the production of chemicals and energy, including bioelectricity, biomethane, biohydrogen, bioethanol, hydrogen peroxide, biodegradable electronics and biosensors, dry air from humid air, air separation into nitrogen and oxygen gases, organic solvent extraction, CO2 and H2 separation from gas mixtures, plasma generation, dewatered microalgae biomass, and purified microalgae-based products, are discussed. Electrochemical membrane processes can offer environmental benefits, such as CO2 reduction, leading to more sustainable and socially responsible production practices. The electrochemical conversion of CO2 can lead to the production of valuable chemicals, such as ethanol. With continued research and development, electrochemical membrane technology is expected to play an increasingly important role in chemical and energy production.</description>

                Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly large role in catalysis, similar to other aspects of manufacturing. In particular, modern data science and machine learning (ML) methods coupled with informatics, optimization, and statistics are fast becoming a mainstay in both the modeling and design of catalysts and associated processes. This chapter provides an overview of AI and ML in (1) improving mechanistic modeling by speeding up bottleneck steps, (2) developing models to compute adsorbate and transition state energies quickly, (3) screen vast spaces of catalysts efficiently, and (4) learn from experimental data and guide further experimentation, including high throughput and autonomous experiments, to discover new catalytic formulations. Underlying all of these topics are cross-cutting concepts such as model interpretability, uncertainty quantification, incorporating domain knowledge, and community-wide sharing/access to databases and software. Significant advances have been made in a short span, there is tremendous untapped potential for AI and ML in catalysis.</description>
