      <title>Asymmetric O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Ru&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Active Sites via Coordination Engineering for Tuning Hydrogen Evolution across the Full pH Value</title>

                The asymmetric coordination engineering of single metal atom is a challenging task for single-atom catalysts (SACs) to further amplify the catalytic potential. Hence, a unique asymmetric O2&#8211;Ru&#8211;N2 active site is meticulously engineered through the pyrolysis of an organic complex with 1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-dicarboxylic acid and Ru metal ions. The coordination evolution of the Ru atom is examined as a function of annealing temperature, evolving from the asymmetric O2&#8211;Ru&#8211;N2 configuration to the asymmetric O2&#8211;Ru&#8211;Ru and finally to the Ru&#8211;Ru structure. The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance makes it clear that the SACs with asymmetric O2&#8211;Ru&#8211;N2 active sites outperform intermediate O2&#8211;Ru&#8211;Ru, Ru nanosheets, and even commercial Pt/C catalysts across the full pH value. The optimal HER performance is attributed to the formation of asymmetric O2&#8211;Ru&#8211;N2 active sites, which exhibit the lowest &#916;GH* owing to the unique structure of Ru coordinated with double heterononmetallic atoms, which is confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. This work underscores the pivotal role of coordination engineering in SACs, with particular emphasis on the significance of asymmetric single-atom catalytic centers and their potential in diverse catalytic applications.</description>

      <title>Acidic media enables oxygen-tolerant electrosynthesis of multicarbon products from simulated flue gas</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-45527-1</link>

                Abstract Renewable electricity powered electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO 2 R) offers a valuable method to close the carbon cycle and reduce our overreliance on fossil fuels. However, high purity CO 2 is usually required as feedstock, which potentially decreases the feasibility and economic viability of the process. Direct conversion of flue gas is an attractive option but is challenging due to the low CO 2 concentration and the presence of O 2 impurities. As a result, up to 99% of the applied current can be lost towards the undesired oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Here, we show that acidic electrolyte can significantly suppress ORR on Cu, enabling generation of multicarbon products from simulated flue gas. Using a composite Cu and carbon supported single-atom Ni tandem electrocatalyst, we achieved a multicarbon Faradaic efficiency of 46.5% at 200 mA cm -2 , which is ~20 times higher than bare Cu under alkaline conditions. We also demonstrate stable performance for 24 h with a multicarbon product full-cell energy efficiency of 14.6%. Strikingly, this result is comparable to previously reported acidic CO 2 R systems using pure CO 2 . Our findings demonstrate a potential pathway towards designing efficient electrolyzers for direct conversion of flue gas to value-added chemicals and fuels.</description>

                Abstract Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), promising bifunctional electrocatalysts for overall water splitting, are hindered by their poor conductivity and sluggish electrochemical reaction kinetics. Herein, a hierarchical Cu&#8208;doped NiCo LDH/NiCo alloy heterostructure with rich oxygen vacancies by electronic modulation is tactfully designed. It extraordinarily effectively drives both the oxygen evolution reaction (151 mV@10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (73 mV@10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) in an alkaline medium. As bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.51 V at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and remarkable long&#8208;term stability for 100 h are achieved. The experimental and theoretical results reveal that Cu doping and NiCo alloy recombination can improve the conductivity and reaction kinetics of NiCo LDH with surface charge redistribution and reduced Gibbs free energy barriers. This work provides a new inspiration for further design and construction of nonprecious metal&#8208;based bifunctional electrocatalysts based on electronic structure modulation strategies.</description>

                The introduction of defect sites has been widely reported to enhance electrocatalysts&#8217; abilities by increasing their affinity for reaction intermediates. Many different defect types, such as cation and anion vacancies, can exist in nano-materials. The different defect sites can make different contributions to the electrochemical ability. Therefore, a constructed defect should be accurate and specific, which makes it easy to identify the optimal defect type to facilitate electrochemical reactions. In this work, we used cobalt vacancies in Co3O4 as an example and synthesized Co3O4 with bivalent cobalt vacancies (Co3O4-VCo(II)) and trivalent cobalt vacancies (Co3O4-VCo(III)). Electrochemical results demonstrate that introducing cobalt vacancies considerably enhances the electrocatalytic activity of Co3O4. Furthermore, Co3O4-VCo(II) exhibits the most outstanding oxygen evolution ability with the fastest reaction kinetic rate. Quasi-operando X-ray photoelectron microscopy spectrum analysis results indicate that the presence of VCo(II) can accelerate CoOOH active site formation during the oxygen evolution reaction process. Density functional theory calculations reveal that introducing cobalt vacancies can endow Co3O4 with metal-like conductivity. The O p-band center can be moved near the Fermi level, and the free energy barrier can be the lowest with the presence of VCo(II), resulting in a fast kinetics rate of oxygen exchange at the electrocatalyst surface and optimal adsorption energy to reaction intermediates to display excellent electrochemical ability. This work provides substantial guidance for designing efficient defect-rich electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Element-dependent effects of alkali cations on nitrate reduction to ammonia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2024.02.011</link>
      <description>Yida Zhang, Zhentao Ma, Shuo Yang, Qingyu Wang, Limin Liu, Yu Bai, Dewei Rao, Gongming Wang, Hongliang Li, Xusheng Zheng, Science Bulletin. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391691052

                Catalytic conversion of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) pollutants into ammonia (NH3) offers a sustainable and promising route for both wastewater treatment and NH3 synthesis. Alkali cations are prevalent in nitrate solutions, but their roles beyond charge balance in catalytic NO3&#8722; conversion have been generally ignored. Herein, we report the promotion effect of K+ cations in KNO3 solution for NO3&#8722; reduction over a TiO2-supported Ni single-atom catalyst (Ni1/TiO2). For photocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction reaction, Ni1/TiO2 exhibited a 1.9-fold NH3 yield rate with nearly 100% selectivity in KNO3 solution relative to that in NaNO3 solution. Mechanistic studies reveal that the K+ cations from KNO3 gradually bonded with the surface of Ni1/TiO2, in situ forming a K-O-Ni moiety during reaction, whereas the Na+ ions were unable to interact with the catalyst in NaNO3 solution. The charge accumulation on the Ni sites induced by the incorporation of K atom promoted the adsorption and activation of NO3&#8722;. Furthermore, the K-O-Ni moiety facilitated the multiple proton-electron coupling of NO3&#8722; into NH3 by stabilizing the intermediates.</description>

      <title>Electrosynthesis of H2O2 via two-electron oxygen reduction over carbon-based catalysts: From microenvironment control to electrode/reactor design</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enrev.2024.100069</link>
      <description>Jingjing Jia, Zhenxin Li, Yunrui Tian, Xia Li, Rui Chen, Jiachen Liu, Ji Liang, Energy reviews. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391691194

                The electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by the two-electron oxygen reduction (2e&#8722;-ORR) process has the advantages of high safety, low energy consumption, and environmental friendliness. For 2e&#8722;-ORR, the catalyst/electrode is the key component as it strongly affects catalytic performance and cost. Carbon materials have the advantages of high electronic conductivity, good structural stability, easy control of nanostructures, and low cost. Therefore, it has been regarded as a promising catalyst/electrode material for the electrosynthesis of H2O2 via 2e&#8722;-ORR. In addition, studies have also considered the optimization of the liquid/gas interface by tuning the electrode surface, electrolyte pH, and reactor configurations for further improving the activity and selectivity of catalysts. In this review, we provide an in-depth discussion of the recent research on the carbon-based electrocatalysts for 2e&#8722;-ORR, especially in terms of microenvironment tuning, catalyst/electrode interface engineering, and reactor design for achieving stable and efficient production of H2O2. The challenges that we are still facing and the future development prospects will then be concluded, which we believe should help the future development in this field.</description>

      <title>Constructing heterojunctions of CoAl2O4 and Ni3S2 anchored on carbon cloth to acquire multiple active sites for efficient overall water splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2024.118109</link>
      <description>Ting Cheng, Mingyue Wen, Chen Chen, Junfa Zhu, Yongnian Dai, Xiao Zhang, Baoxuan Hou, Lei Wang, Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391692471

                Constructing heterojunction interface is an efficient strategy to accelerate the catalytic activity for electrochemical reaction. In this work, a novel composite heterojunction electrocatalyst (CAO/NiS400/CC), deriving from the combination of CoAl2O4 (CAO) and Ni3S2 anchored on carbon cloth (CC) was prepared, through hydrothermal process followed by electrodeposition. After successful synthesis, CoAl2O4 particles were intricately embedded in Ni3S2 and formed an active heterostructure, exhibited outstanding catalytic capacity for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and improved the efficiencies of overall water splitting. As expected, the composite heterojunction electrocatalyst demonstrated excellent catalytic performances with lower overpotential of 163.2 mV at 100 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of 20.4 mV&#183;dec-1for HER and 400 mV at 100 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of 51.1 mV&#183;dec-1 for OER, respectively, accompanied by long-term structural stability after 40 h and 3000 Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) cycles. Moreover, Density functional theory (DFT) calculation illustrated that the robust electrocatalytic performance was attributed to the simultaneous presence of multiple catalytic active sites surrounding the heterojunction interface. Furthermore, CAO/NiS400/CC electrocatalyst facilitated the overall water splitting reaction under a cell voltage of only 1.48 V with dual catalytic capabilities for HER and OER. The combined action of active catalytic sites within both CAO and Ni3S2 around the interface contributed the optimal electrocatalytic performance, making the CAO/NiS400/CC as a promising alternative to electrocatalysts for water splitting.</description>

                ConspectusThe global energy landscape is undergoing significant change. Hydrogen is seen as the energy carrier of the future and will be a key element in the development of more sustainable industry and society. However, hydrogen is currently produced mainly from fossil fuels, and this needs to change. Alkaline water electrolysis with advanced technology has the most significant potential for this transition to produce large-scale green hydrogen by utilizing renewable energy. The assembly of industrial electrolyzer plants is more complex on a larger scale, but it follows a basic working principle, which involves two half-cells of anode and cathode sites where the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occur. Out of the two reactions, the OER is more challenging both thermodynamically and kinetically. Besides having access to renewable electricity, developing durable and abundant electrocatalysts for the OER remains a challenge in large-scale alkaline water electrolysis. Among different physicochemical properties, the electrocatalyst surface and its interaction with water and reaction intermediates, as well as formed molecular hydrogen and oxygen, play an essential role in the catalytic performance and the reaction mechanism. In particular, the binding strengths between the catalyst surface and intermediates determine the rate-limiting step and electrocatalytic performance.This Account gives some insights into the status of the hydrogen economy and basic principles of alkaline water electrolysis by covering its fundamentals as well as industrial developments. Further, the HER and OER reaction mechanisms of alkaline water electrolysis and selected electrocatalyst progress for both half-reactions are briefly discussed. The Adsorbate Evolution Mechanism and the Lattice Oxygen Mechanism for the OER are explained with specific references. This Account also deliberates on the author&#8217;s selected contributions to the development of transition metal-based electrocatalysts for alkaline water electrolysis with an emphasis on OER. The focus is particularly given to the enhancement of intrinsic activity, the role of eg-filling, phase segregation, and defect structure of cobalt-based electrocatalysts for OER. Structural modification and phase transformation of the cobalt oxide electrocatalyst under working conditions are further deliberated. In addition, the creation of new active surface species and the activation of cobalt- and nickel-based electrocatalysts through iron uptake from the alkaline electrolyte are discussed. In the end, this Account provides a brief overview of challenges related to large-scale production and utilization of green hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Potential synergy between Pt2Ni4 Atomic-Clusters, oxygen vacancies and adjacent Pd nanoparticles outperforms commercial Pt nanocatalyst in alkaline fuel cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.149421</link>
      <description>Dinesh Bhalothia, Amisha Beniwal, Che Yan, Kai-Chin Wang, Chenhao Wang, Tsan&#8208;Yao Chen, Chemical Engineering Journal. 483(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391706540

                The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key &#8220;showstopper&#8221; for the commercial viability of alkaline fuel cells (AFCs). In this study, we developed a ternary nanocatalyst (NC) coloaded with Pt2Ni4 atomic clusters and palladium (Pd) nanoparticles (NPs) on oxygen vacancies (OVs) enriched nickel hydroxide-support (henceforth denoted as NiPP). This material outperforms the commercial J.M.-Pt/C (20 wt%) catalyst by &#8764;75 and &#8764;38 times with exceptionally high mass activities (MA)s of 5050.3 mAmgPt-1 and 952.3 mAmgPt-1 at 0.85 V and 0.90 V vs RHE, respectively, in alkaline ORR (0.1 M KOH). The high structural reliability of the Pt2Ni4 endows the NiPP NC with outstanding durability, where it achieves an optimum MA of 5755.9 mAmgPt-1 after 10 K cycles in an accelerated durability test (ADT) and retains the original performance up to 15 K cycles. Moreover, NiPP delivers an outstanding power density (339.1.4 mW cm&#8722;2) and short circuit current density (910.8 mA cm&#8722;2), which exceeds the commercial J.M.-Pt/C (174.9 mW cm&#8722;2 and 720.4 mA cm&#8722;2) when serving as the cathodic catalyst in an AFC. The results of physical characterizations, electrochemical analysis and in-situ XAS analysis suggest that the exceptional performance is originated from the potential synergism between the neighbouring reaction sites of Pt2Ni4 (OV in Ni(OH)x and Pd NPs). During ORR, the Pt2Ni4 atomic clusters and OVs boost the O2 splitting, while the adjacent Pd NPs promote the subsequent relocation of OH&#8211; ions. The obtained results provide the potential design strategies for the atomic-scale surface engineering of advanced ORR NCs in alkaline fuel cells.</description>

                Abstract Nitrate (NO 3 &#8210; ) pollution poses significant threats to water quality and global nitrogen cycles. Alkaline electrocatalytic NO 3 &#8210; reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) emerges as an attractive route for enabling NO 3 &#8210; removal and sustainable ammonia (NH 3 ) synthesis. However, it suffers from insufficient proton (H + ) supply in high pH conditions, restricting NO 3 &#8210; -to-NH 3 activity. Herein, we propose a halogen-mediated H + feeding strategy to enhance the alkaline NO 3 RR performance. Our platform achieves near-100% NH 3 Faradaic efficiency (pH = 14) with a current density of 2 A cm &#8211;2 and enables an over 99% NO 3 &#8211; -to-NH 3 conversion efficiency. We also convert NO 3 &#8210; to high-purity NH 4 Cl with near-unity efficiency, suggesting a practical approach to valorizing pollutants into valuable ammonia products. Theoretical simulations and in situ experiments reveal that Cl-coordination endows a shifted d -band center of Pd atoms to construct local H + -abundant environments, through arousing dangling O-H water dissociation and fast *H desorption, for *NO intermediate hydrogenation and finally effective NO 3 &#8210; -to-NH 3 conversion.</description>

      <title>Enhanced alkaline hydrogen evolution performance through Ru-Incorporated electronic structure Modification: Transitioning from Mo3P to Mo2RuP</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.149486</link>
      <description>Peng Zhang, Shiyu Xu, Zhengyang Li, Zongfu An, Ho Seok Park, Ji Man Kim, Pil J. Yoo, Chemical Engineering Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391718332

                In accordance with the Sabatier principle, Mo-based catalysts typically exhibit lower catalytic activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to strong interactions between Mo and hydrogen within their structures. To overcome this limitation, here, we introduce a novel approach by incorporating Ru into Mo3P to modify its electronic structure, resulting in a novel water splitting cathode material of I&#773;42m structured Mo2RuP. Notably, Mo2RuP demonstrates as an efficient catalyst for alkaline HER, exhibiting outstanding performance with extremely low overpotentials of 29 mV and 62 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 100 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. It also displays a small Tafel slope (30 mV dec-1) and long-term durability in hydrogen production even at a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 in a 1 mol/L KOH solution. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that Ru-substitution significantly reduces the hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy on various crystal facets of Mo2RuP. This alteration facilitates the transformation of the material to the kinetically favorable Volmer-Heyrovsky pathway during the HER. Furthermore, a comprehensive characterization and investigation into the electronic structure of this innovative material validate the efficacy of Ru modulation within the Mo3P structure. The strategy of Ru-substitution to adjust the electronic structure of Mo-based catalysts offers a viable approach for the development of novel, stable, and high-performance catalysts for the HER.</description>

                Abstract The chloride ions in seawater result in corrosion, low catalytic efficiency, and poor stability of the electrocatalysts in direct seawater electrolysis, which limits the use of large&#8208;scale seawater electrolysis technology. Herein, a corrosion&#8208;resistant Ag/NiFeRu layered double hydroxide (LDH) electrocatalyst for seawater electrolysis at industrial current density, in which Ru and Ag species in the catalyst can have a corrosion&#8208;resistance of chloride ions from the anode surface and enhance its robustness in seawater is designed. The catalyst requires the overpotentials of 256 and 287 mV to obtain a current density of 1 A cm &#8722;2 in 1 m KOH and 1 m KOH + seawater, respectively. More importantly, it works stably for over 1000 h at 1 A cm &#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. Further quasi&#8208;industrial conditions measurement (6 m KOH + seawater, 60 &#176;C) shows a markedly low overpotential of 174 mV at 1 A cm &#8722;2 on Ag/NiFeRu LDH, obtaining over 140 h under harsh industrial conditions. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Ru species can effectively regulate the local electronic structure of NiFe LDH, and enhance the intrinsic activity of NiFe LDH. The transformation of Ag 2 O from Ag during OER stabilizes the Fe site in NiFe LDH, which improves the overall stability of the electrocatalyst.</description>

                Here we report on the discovery of a novel fast potassium super stoichiometric silicate, with fully earth&#8208;abundant nominal chemical composition of K 2+ x Mg 1&#8722; x /2 SiO 4 , which exhibits near superionic K + conductivity, up to 5 &#215; 10 &#8722;5 S cm &#8722;1 at room temperature. Fast K + conduction is attributed to a high Continuous Symmetry Measure value in K&#8208;polyhedrons, coupled with a low packing ratio of Corner&#8208;Sharing&#8208;framework. This is the first time that such a high conductivity is measured by a rock&#8208;silicate formed only by abundant metal ions. K 2+ x Mg 1&#8722; x /2 SiO 4 displays excellent stability under air and humidity, which renders it a very promising candidate for economical fabrication of electrochemical devices such as potentiometric gas sensors. We demonstrated this by fabricating a gas sensor for SO 2 detection, as the first demonstration of type III potentiometric gas sensors using K + conductors. At 500 &#176;C and SO 2 concentrations in the range of 0&#8211;10 ppm, the sensor exhibited high sensitivities (69&#8211;72 mV dec &#8722;1 ), robust signal output (220 mV for 2 ppm of SO 2 ), fast response times (1&#8211;6 min), and excellent stability in ambient condition.</description>

      <title>Recent advances and prospects of iron-based noble metal-free catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction in acidic environment: A mini review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.02.027</link>
      <description>Hongyan Xu, Zhanhong Ma, Zhongmin Wan, Zhongfu An, Xiaoguang Wang, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 59(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391731405

                The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurred in acidic media, as the cathode reaction of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) with great commercialization potential, has attracted much attention. However, the slow kinetics of ORR and the high cost of cathode catalysts (mainly platinum (Pt)-based materials in current) have become the main obstacle to the rapid development of PEMFCs. Therefore, the exploration of efficient and inexpensive non-precious metal-based ORR catalysts has emerged as an urgent issue. Non-noble transition metal-based materials have been widely investigated as ORR catalysts in acidic media. This review focused on the investigation of iron (Fe) based catalysts in acidic ORR processes. In this review, the ORR mechanism was first introduced. Subsequently, the fabrication method of Fe-based catalysts by co-pyrolysis of mixtures containing Fe, non-metal, and organic precursors was discussed. Finally, the recent advances of Fe-based materials (carbides, nitrides, oxides, phosphides, chalcogenides, hybrids, alloys and single atom catalysts) as acidic ORR catalysts were summarized, and mainly focused on catalytic performance, stability and catalytic mechanism studies with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives of Fe-based catalysts were also proposed.</description>

      <title>Tackling the activity and selectivity challenges of electrocatalysts towards CO2 reduction reaction via atomically dispersed dual atom catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2024.159687</link>

                Atomically dispersed catalysts are widely employed in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) owing to maximal atomic utilization and outstanding intrinsic activity. Dual atom catalysts (DACs) can provide dispersed active sites and distinct electronic structure, which is conducive to the catalytic performance. In this work, we explored a series of DACs composed of transition metals or main group metals supported on nitrogen-doped graphene (M2&#8211;NC) toward high-performance CO2RR. The radius of metal atom is a key factor determining the stability of M2&#8211;NC, that metals (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Sn, Pt, and Bi) with small radius can be steadily anchored. Fe2/Co2/Ru2&#8211;NC are screened out to activate CO2 because of the strong interaction between metals d orbitals and CO2 2&#960; orbitals. The results show that Fe2/Co2&#8211;NC can promote CO2RR to generate HCOOH with limiting potentials (UL) of &#8722;0.36 and &#8722;0.25 V. Ru2&#8211;NC can catalyze the generation of CH3OH and CH4 with UL of &#8722;0.28 V. Limited potential difference between CO2RR and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) show that Fe2/Co2/Ru2&#8211;NC can inhibit HER during CO2RR. This work demonstrates Fe2/Co2/Ru2&#8211;NC as high-performance CO2RR catalysts and highlights the type of central metal atoms as a vital role for atomically dispersed electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Highly efficient Ru-based Heusler alloys for nitrogen reduction reaction: Breaking scaling relations and regulating potential determining steps</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2024.159686</link>
      <description>Xiayong Chen, Jing Zhou, Wangyu Hu, Bowen Huang, Dingwang Yuan, Applied Surface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391733718

                In this study, we investigated the catalytic activity of Ru-based Heusler alloys towards the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) using first-principles calculations. Compared to pure Ru metal, these alloys exhibit a significant reduction in the overpotential, showcasing enhanced catalytic performance. The most promising candidate, the Ru2ScP alloy, demonstrates an impressively low overpotential of only &#8722;0.40 V for the NRR, and it also exhibits higher selectivity towards NRR over the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Furthermore, we found that several key adsorbates on the surface of the candidate alloys simultaneously exhibit non-linear scaling relationships of adsorption free energies. This allows for individual control over the barrier of potential determining steps (PDS) in the NRR process by overcoming the limitation of the scaling relations in pure metals. This study offers valuable guidance for the design of Ru-based Heusler alloys to obtain improved catalytic performance for the NRR.</description>

      <title>Surface Strain Effect on Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction of Pt-Based Intermetallics</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c06291</link>

                Elucidating the relationship between electrocatalytic activity and surface strain is pivotal for designing highly efficient electrocatalysts for the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, a general correlation is currently absent due to the lack of ideal catalytic materials platforms with well-defined structures and components. Herein, we select L10 and L12 Pt-based intermetallic compounds as model materials to construct a series of core&#8211;shell catalysts with strained Pt skins (IMC@Pt) and establish the correlation between surface strain and HER performance. Density functional theory calculations were performed to determine the surface strain degree, d-band center, and key descriptor &#916;GH* of the catalysts for HER. By combining theoretical and experimental data, we propose a volcano-type trend between surface strain and the HER activity of IMC@Pt with an apex at 4% compressive strain. In addition, we demonstrate a class of highly active and durable IMC@Pt catalysts for acidic HER. Among them, the Pt3V@Pt catalyst exhibits the highest intrinsic HER activity with a specific activity of 4.24 mA cmPt&#8211;2 at an overpotential of 20 mV, which is 4 times higher than that of Pt. This work provides a solid understanding of the essential nature of PtM alloy catalysts and can guide the design of high-performance HER catalysts for water electrolyzers.</description>

      <title>Surface Electronic Properties-Driven Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction on Metal-Conjugated Porphyrin 2D-MOFs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.3c16406</link>
      <description>Ashakiran Maibam, Ibrahim Orhan, Sa&#239;laja Krishnamurty, Salvy P. Russo, Ravichandar Babarao, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391742646

                Two-dimensional (2D) metal organic framework (MOF) or metalloporphyrin nanosheets with a stable metal-N4 complex unit present the metal as a single-atom catalyst dispersed in the 2D porphyrin framework. First-principles calculations on the 3d-transition metals in M-TCPP are investigated in this study for their surface-dependent electronic properties including work function and d-band center. Crystal orbital Hamiltonian population (-pCOHP) analysis highlights a higher contribution of the bonding state in the M&#8211;N bond and antibonding state in the N&#8211;N bond to be essential for N&#8211;N bond activation. A linear relationship between &#916;Gmax and surface electronic properties, N&#8211;N bond strength, and Bader charge has been found to influence the rate-determining potential for nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) in M-TCPP MOFs. 2D Ti-TCPP MOF, with a kinetic energy barrier of 1.43 eV in the final protonation step of enzymatic NRR, shows exclusive NRR selectivity over competing hydrogen reduction (HER) and nitrogenous compounds (NO and NO2). Thus, Ti-TCPP MOF with an NRR limiting potential of &#8722;0.35 V in water solvent is proposed as an attractive candidate for electrocatalytic NRR.</description>

                Electrocatalytic refinery of low-value biomass-based glycerol into value-added chemicals formic acid (FA) is an attractive alternative to traditional thermochemical refineries. However, constructing non-precious catalysts with abundant active hydroxyl (OH*) is the main obstacle to the electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (EGOR). Herein, we combine density functional theory (DFT) and experiments to investigate EGOR over the finely constructed NiCo2O4 nanosheets. DFT results firstly indicate that the NiCo2O4 nanosheets exhibit the highly hydroxylated (311)-OH* surface with the lowest Gibbs free energy, which significantly improves the electrochemical reaction kinetics and can achieve desirable FA yield by adjusting the adsorption energy of the adsorption intermediate. Following the theoretical prediction, ultrathin NiCo2O4 nanosheets (~1.70 nm) are fabricated by a facile electrodeposition method with sufficient OH* on the surface. The charge-transfer resistance of NiCo2O4 nanosheets in EGOR is only 0.94 &#937; and the anode power consumption can be reduced by up to 320 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, keeping the high glycerol conversion (89%) and FA selectivity (70%) during the 120-h stability test. DFT calculations and experimental tools (e.g., multi-potential step experiments, operational electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) confirm that OH* in-situ generated on the thin nanosheets structure is essential in facilitating charge transfer between catalysts and adsorbed molecules to enhance C&#8211;C bond cleavage. This work offers a guideline for the rational design of robust catalysts for the selective upgrading of biomass-derived chemicals.</description>

                Electrochemically converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels in acidic media is argued as a promising energy- and carbon-efficient route. Although several key roles of alkali cations have been unveiled, the alkali cation trends for CO2 reduction remain largely elusive. With decreasing cation size from Cs+ to Li+, here we show that the apparent proton diffusion coefficient in 3.0 M Li+ is tens-fold lower than in 3.0 M K+ and 3.0 M Cs+ acidic electrolytes. Although Li+ has the strongest inhibition ability for proton transport, it acts the worst for both the CO2-to-CO conversion and partial current density on Au catalysts. Unexpectedly, K+ with a higher proton transport performs the best for CO2-to-CO conversion. We thus revisit the roles of alkali cations and find that hydrated K+ can stabilize hydrogen radicals benefiting CO2 conversion at the electrode interface while for Li+ this is not the case. This study proposes that cation-stabilized atomic hydrogen assists in activating CO2 via a reverse water-gas shift route under electrochemical conditions.</description>

                Designing rubber formulations can greatly benefit from using a database that stores the formulations and corresponding property data of rubber composites. Such a database can expedite the decision-making process by swiftly identifying the most suitable formulations for specific applications. However, the management of a rubber formulation database encounters various issues, including missing formulation and property data, as well as data entry errors. These issues can impede the decision-making processes and even result in incorrect decisions being made. In this study, machine learning (ML) algorithms were applied to analyze rubber formulation databases. Our findings highlight the success of the ML algorithm in effectively filling in missing data and identifying erroneous data. Furthermore, it demonstrates the accurate prediction of properties for untested formulations within the pre-determined database space. The results underline the outstanding performance of ML algorithms in expediting the rubber formulation design process and emphasize their immense potential to play a prominent role in the advancement of rubber composites.</description>
