      <title>Machine Learning Potentials with the Iterative Boltzmann Inversion: Training to Experiment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c01051</link>
      <description>Sakib Matin, Alice Allen, Justin S. Smith, Nicholas Lubbers, Ryan B. Jadrich, Richard A. Messerly, Benjamin Nebgen, Ying Wai Li, Sergei Tretiak, Kipton Barros, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391464120

                Methodologies for training machine learning potentials (MLPs) with quantum-mechanical simulation data have recently seen tremendous progress. Experimental data have a very different character than simulated data, and most MLP training procedures cannot be easily adapted to incorporate both types of data into the training process. We investigate a training procedure based on iterative Boltzmann inversion that produces a pair potential correction to an existing MLP using equilibrium radial distribution function data. By applying these corrections to an MLP for pure aluminum based on density functional theory, we observe that the resulting model largely addresses previous overstructuring in the melt phase. Interestingly, the corrected MLP also exhibits improved performance in predicting experimental diffusion constants, which are not included in the training procedure. The presented method does not require autodifferentiating through a molecular dynamics solver and does not make assumptions about the MLP architecture. Our results suggest a practical framework for incorporating experimental data into machine learning models to improve the accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Interplay of the Br&#248;nsted Acidity of Catalyst Ancillary Groups and the Solution Components in Iron-porphyrin-Mediated Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>

                The rapid and efficient conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) is an ongoing challenge. Catalysts based on iron-porphyrin cores have emerged as excellent electrochemical mediators of the two proton + two electron reduction of CO2 to CO, and many of the design features that promote function are known. Of those design features, the incorporation of Br&#248;nsted acids in the second coordination sphere of the iron ion has a significant impact on catalyst turnover kinetics. The Br&#248;nsted acids are often in the form of hydroxyphenyl groups. Herein, we explore how the acidity of an ancillary 2-hydroxyphenyl group affects the performance of CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. A series of meso-5,10,15,20-tetraaryl porphyrins were prepared where only the functional group at the 5-meso position has an ionizable proton. A series of cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments reveal that the complex with &#8722;OMe positioned para to the ionizable &#8722;OH shows the largest CO2 reduction rate constants in acetonitrile solvent. This is the least acidic &#8722;OH of the compounds surveyed. The turnover frequency of the &#8722;OMe derivative can be further improved with the addition of 4-trifluoromethylphenol to the solution. In contrast, the iron-porphyrin complex with &#8722;CF3 positioned opposite the ionizable &#8722;OH shows the smallest CO2 reduction rate constants, and its turnover frequency is less enhanced with the addition of phenols to the reaction solutions. The origin of this effect is rationalized based on kinetic isotope effect experiments and density functional calculations. We conclude that catalysts with weaker internal acids coupled with stronger external acid additives provide superior CO2 reduction kinetics.</description>

                In this work, we have employed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) to account for the comparative efficiency of TiO2 and g-CN supported Ru2 and Rh2 dual-atom catalysts (DACs) for electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RRs). Based on DFT calculations, g-CN supported DACs were found to have superior stability and CO2 reduction activity than that of TiO2 supported DACs. However, Ru2@g-CN and Rh2@g-CN double atom catalysts suffer from poor selectivity, as the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is likely to occur more favorably than that of CO2RR. Here, we have revealed that the replacement of one noble metal by an earth-abundant transition metal can boost the selectivity of CO2RRs, while inhibiting the HER. In search of a highly selective and low-cost noble-metal based CO2 reduction catalyst, we have designed a series of g-CN supported heteronuclear MRu (M = Sc&#8211;Zn) dimers and performed a systematic computational screening to identify a suitable adatom (M), which drastically improves the selectivity. Based on the evaluation of stability, activity, and selectivity, VRu@g-CN is finally identified as the best candidate, with the lowest limiting potential of &#8722;0.11 V and a high theoretical Faradaic efficiency of 99.57%.</description>

                Abstract Nanostructured ionic compounds have driven major technological advancements in displays, photovoltaics, and catalysis. Current research focuses on refining the chemical composition of such compounds. In this study, a strategy for creating stoichiometrically well&#8208;defined nanoscale multiple&#8208;cation systems, where the atomically precise structure maximizes the synergistic cooperation between cations at the atomic scale is reported. The unprecedented construction of Heusler&#8208;type PtRuP 2 double&#8208;walled nanotubes through sequential anion/cation exchange reactions is demonstrated. The PtRuP 2 catalyst exhibits record&#8208;high catalytic performance and durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline electrolytes and anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers. The investigations highlight the crucial role of Pt/Ru dual centers, providing multiple active sites that accelerate the HER kinetics within a single phosphide material, in the sequential operation of H 2 O activation/dissociation at Ru and H 2 production at adjacent Pt sites. These findings open new avenues for optimizing ionic compound&#8208;based HER electrocatalysts, offering platinum&#8208;metal alternatives in acidic and alkaline media.</description>

      <title>Insight into Selectivity Differences of Glycerol Electro-Oxidation on Pt(111) and Ag(111)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05551</link>
      <description>Zhongjie Meng, David Tran, Johan Hjelm, Henrik H. Kristoffersen, Jan Rossmeisl, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391484173

                Electro-oxidation is a way to utilize glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel production, to produce fuels and feedstock chemicals for the chemical industry. A significant challenge is to get products with high selectivity, so it is desirable to understand the glycerol oxidation mechanisms in further detail. Using density functional theory calculations, we investigated possible glycerol oxidation intermediates on Pt(111) and Ag(111). We find that the different adsorption preferences of the intermediates on Pt (adsorption via carbon atoms) and Ag (adsorption via oxygen atoms) lead to different preferred reaction pathways, resulting in different products. The reaction pathways on both surfaces involve glyceraldehyde as a key intermediate; however, upon further oxidation, Pt(111) preferentially produces glyceric acid (CH2OH&#8211;CHOH&#8211;COOH), while on Ag(111) C&#8211;C bonds are broken, which leads to the production of glycolaldehyde and formic acid (CH2OH&#8211;CHO and HCOOH). These predictions agree well with the experimental outcome of the electro-oxidation of glycerol on Pt and Ag surfaces. Our study therefore provides useful insights for optimizing the selectivity of glycerol oxidation and improving the utilization of glycerol.</description>

      <title>Step-Edge Decoration and Clustering of Pt Atoms on a Cu(211) Stepped Surface</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c04776</link>
      <description>Amin Mohammadpour, Sarp Kaya, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391484211

                The atomic manipulation of the low-coordination sites of metal catalysts can give rise to activity enhancement; however, it is rather challenging to locally probe the dynamic changes and activities of these sites. Herein, step-edge/terrace site decoration and site exchange of Pt atoms with a stepped Cu(211) surface were investigated by a combination of infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRRAS) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of carbon monoxide (CO). For a low coverage of Pt, step decoration and site exchange with Cu were found to be two pathways to isolate Pt as single atoms. CO preferentially adsorbs near the Cu step sites on the lower terrace, and the binding energies of CO show strong Pt coverage dependence. The presence of Pt on terrace and step sites modifies the binding energy of CO absorbed on Cu in the proximity. Increased Pt&#8211;Pt lateral coordination changes the site preference; however, the reduced binding energy of CO to Pt is attributed to heteroatom bond formation rather than the strain induced by the lattice mismatch.</description>

      <title>Metal&#8211;Support Interaction between Titanium Oxynitride and Pt Nanoparticles Enables Efficient Low-Pt-Loaded High-Performance Electrodes at Relevant Oxygen Reduction Reaction Current Densities</title>

                In the present work, we report on a synergistic relationship between platinum nanoparticles and a titanium oxynitride support (TiOxNy/C) in the context of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysis. As demonstrated herein, this composite configuration results in significantly improved electrocatalytic activity toward the ORR relative to platinum dispersed on carbon support (Pt/C) at high overpotentials. Specifically, the ORR performance was assessed under an elevated mass transport regime using the modified floating electrode configuration, which enabled us to pursue the reaction closer to PEMFC-relevant current densities. A comprehensive investigation attributes the ORR performance increase to a strong interaction between platinum and the TiOxNy/C support. In particular, according to the generated strain maps obtained via scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the Pt-TiOxNy/C analogue exhibits a more localized strain in Pt nanoparticles in comparison to that in the Pt/C sample. The altered Pt structure could explain the measured ORR activity trend via the d-band theory, which lowers the platinum surface coverage with ORR intermediates. In terms of the Pt particle size effect, our observation presents an anomaly as the Pt-TiOxNy/C analogue, despite having almost two times smaller nanoparticles (2.9 nm) compared to the Pt/C benchmark (4.8 nm), manifests higher specific activity. This provides a promising strategy to further lower the Pt loading and increase the ECSA without sacrificing the catalytic activity under fuel cell-relevant potentials. Apart from the ORR, the platinum-TiOxNy/C interaction is of a sufficient magnitude not to follow the typical particle size effect also in the context of other reactions such as CO stripping, hydrogen oxidation reaction, and water discharge. The trend for the latter is ascribed to the lower oxophilicity of Pt-based on electrochemical surface coverage analysis. Namely, a lower surface coverage with oxygenated species is found for the Pt-TiOxNy/C analogue. Further insights were provided by performing a detailed STEM characterization via the identical location mode (IL-STEM) in particular, via 4DSTEM acquisition. This disclosed that Pt particles are partially encapsulated within a thin layer of TiOxNy origin.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Metal-Ion-Doped Carbon Nitrides for Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05961</link>
      <description>Shanping Liu, Valentin Diez&#8208;Cabanes, Dong Fan, Peixiang Lu, Yuanxing Fang, Markus Antonietti, Guillaume Maurin, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391486029

                Poly(heptazine imides) (PHIs) have emerged as prominent layered carbon nitride-based materials with potential oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic activity owing to their strong VIS light absorption, long excited-state lifetimes, high surface-to-volume ratios, and the possibility of tuning their properties via hosting different metal ions in their pores. A series of metal-ion-doped PHI-M (M = K+, Rb+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and Co2+) were first systematically explored using density functional theory calculations. These simulations led an in-depth understanding of the microscopic OER mechanism in these systems and identified PHI-Co2+ as the best OER catalyst of this family of PHIs, whereas PHI-Mn2+ can be an alternative promising OER catalyst. This level of performance was attributed to a thermodynamically favorable formation of the reaction intermediates as well as its red-shifted absorption in the VIS region involving the population of long-lived states, as revealed by time-dependent density functional theory calculations. We further demonstrated that the electronic properties of the *OH intermediates (Bader population, crystal orbital Hamilton population analysis, and adsorption energies) are reliable descriptors to anticipate the OER activity of this family of PHIs. This rational analysis paved the way toward the prediction of the OER performance of another PHI-M derivative, i.e., PHI-Fe2+. The computationally explored PHI-Fe2+, PHI-Mn2+, and PHI-Co2+ systems were then synthesized alongside PHI-K+, and their photocatalytic OER activities were assessed. These experimental findings confirmed the best photocatalytic OER performance for PHI-Co2+ with an oxygen production of 31.2 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8211;1 that is 60 times higher than the pristine g-C3N4 (0.5 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8211;1), whereas PHI-Fe2+ and PHI-Mn2+ are seen as alternative OER catalysts with attractive oxygen production of 11.20 and 4.69 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8211;1, respectively. Decisively, this joint experimental&#8211;computational study reveals PHI-Co2+ to be among the best of the OER catalysts so far reported in the literature including some perovskites.</description>

                The electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the key process for fuel cells and metal-air batteries at the cathode electrode. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates to replace Pt-based catalysts for highly efficient ORR owing to their maximal atom utilization and excellent catalytic efficiency. This chapter aims to provide fundamentals and the current standing of noble and nonnoble metal-based SACs for O2 reduction in the cathodic reaction of fuel cells and metal-air batteries. The discussion starts with an introduction to the catalytic mechanisms of ORR, followed by an overview of examples of SACs for ORR in fuel cells and metal-air batteries. The influences of chemical composition, active sites, and electronic structure of SACs on the ORR property and catalytic mechanisms have been summarized by the results of experiments that have been reported. A perspective is deliberated at the end about the application prospects and challenges for the development of SACs in fuel cells and metal-air batteries are generalized.</description>

                The excessive consumption of fossil energy causes serious environmental problems, which has driven the exploration of clean and sustainable energy. Oxygen electrocatalysis as the core reaction of emerging energy conversion has attracted significant attention. Fe-based single-atom catalysts (SACs) are efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen electrocatalysis on account of high intrinsic reaction activity, maximized metal atom utilization, well-defined active sites, customizable coordination environment, and regulable electronic structure. Although considerable performance improvements for Fe-based SACs in the oxygen electrocatalysis process have been made, the principle of modifying the electronic structure to promote the catalytic performance of Fe-based SACs is still ambiguous. In this review, the authors systematically summarize the regulation tactics for optimizing the catalytic activity and durability of Fe-based SACs toward oxygen electrocatalysis through different electronic structure adjustment methods, including the modulation of coordination atoms, metallic regulation, and the substrate effect. Ultimately, the challenges and future perspectives in the further development of Fe-based SACs are proposed.</description>

                It is essential to develop electrocatalysts that exhibit excellent performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for electrochemical energy applications. Recently, MoSi2N4 monolayer has been synthesized and attracted widespread interest. Herein, we constructed a series of structures by embedding transition metal (TM = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ir, Pt and Au) atom into MoSi2N4 with N vacancy (VN-MSN), denoted as TM@VN-MSN, and investigated their ORR activity systematically by first-principles calculations. It is found that TM@VN-MSN systems are stable and there is charge transfer between TM atom and MoSi2N4. After screening, Rh@VN-MSN has the best ORR catalytic activity with an overpotential of 0.35 V, even lower than that of classical Pt (1 1 1). Furthermore, an implicit solvation model is used to evaluate the solvent effect. The volcano plots and scaling relations are established based on free energies of intermediates, and verified &#916;G*OH can use as a descriptor to explore the ORR activity on TM@VN-MSN. Moreover, d-band center theory and crystal orbital Hamilton populations (COHP) are used to reveal the ORR activity origin. This work not only provide a promising method for designing a new type of MoSi2N4-based ORR catalysts, but also expands its application in the field of electrocatalysis.</description>

                Developing efficient cathode materials and strategies to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the reaction kinetics were the key scientific issues for the development of high performance lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Modify the properties of a material through strain engineering is an effective strategy to enhance the performance of adsorption and catalysis ability for special species. In this paper, first-principles calculations were carried out to investigate the anchoring effect and electrochemical performance of TiC(001) subjected to biaxial symmetric mechanical (compressive and tensile) strains. The results demonstrate that the adsorption energies of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) were enhanced monotonically and the metallic properties were also remain along with the compressive strain to tensile strain. In addition, an appropriate strain could reduce the migration barrier of Li ions, the dissociation barrier of Li2S and the Gibbs free energy of the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) to realize the rapid charge/discharge processes. Especially, the p-band center of carbon atoms in TiC was proposed as an effective descriptor to identify the adsorption and catalysis ability of the anchoring materials under biaxial strain. Our results indicate that strain engineering is a promising strategy to improve the comprehensive performance of anchoring materials in Li&#8722;S batteries.</description>

      <title>Carbon dioxide hydrogenation for sustainable energy storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.199</link>
      <description>Alberto Boretti, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 58(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391502943

                This paper explores green hydrogen-based carbon dioxide (CO2) hydrogenation for the production of oxygenates, presenting it as a pivotal strategy for mitigating carbon emissions and advancing sustainable energy solutions. The conversion of CO2 into oxygenates through hydrogenation emerges as a promising avenue, particularly in the context of transportation applications where the storage of hydrogen poses challenges. The substitution of fossil diesel and gasoline fuels with green hydrogen-derived dimethyl ether, or methanol/ethanol, is advantageous from a life cycle analysis (LCA) CO2 emission perspective even without the capture of the CO2. However, the greatest sustainability appeal is contingent on the crucial aspect of capturing CO2 when utilizing these fuels, which is an aspect currently absent in the literature. This narrative review comprehensively explores catalytic processes, mechanisms, sustainability perspectives, and the current state of research in this evolving area. It encompasses both the production of oxygenates through CO2 hydrogenation and the subsequent utilization of these oxygenates in fuel cells or combustion systems, emphasizing the integration of CO2 capture technologies. The paper contributes to the discourse surrounding the environmental and technological dimensions of energy storage ecosystems, providing a holistic view of their potential to foster sustainable energy solutions.</description>

      <title>Axial coordinated iron-nitrogen-carbon as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and oxygen redox reactions</title>

                Designing highly active electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution and reduction reactions (OER and ORR) is pivotal to renewable energy technology. Herein, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically investigate the catalytic activity of iron-nitrogen-carbon based covalent organic frameworks (COF) monolayers with axially coordinated ligands (denotes as FeN4-X@COF, X refers to axial ligand, X= -SCN, -I, -H, -SH, -NO2, -Br, -ClO, -Cl, -HCO3, -NO, -ClO2, -OH, -CN and -F). The calculated results demonstrate that all the catalysts possess good thermodynamic and electrochemical stabilities. The different ligands axially ligated to the Fe active center could induce changes in the charge of the Fe center, which further regulates the interaction strength between intermediates and catalysts that governs the catalytic activity. Importantly, FeN4-SH@COF and FeN4-OH@COF are efficient bifunctional catalysts for HER and OER, FeN4-OH@COF and FeN4-I@COF are promising bifunctional catalysts for OER and ORR. These findings not only reveal promising bifunctional HER/OER and OER/ORR catalysts but also provide theoretical guidance for designing optimum iron-nitrogen-carbon based catalysts.</description>

                The performance of single-atom catalysts (SACs) containing Sc, Ti, V, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, and Pt on N-doped carbon (NC) as possible cathodes in advanced chlor-alkali electrolysis has been investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) with the aim of finding candidates to improve the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). A plausible mechanism is proposed for the ORR that allows making use of the computational hydrogen electrode (CHE) approach in this environment, and suitable models have been used to estimate the free-energy changes corresponding to the elementary reaction steps. The performance of the different catalysts has been analyzed in terms of the electrochemical-step symmetry index (ESSI) and Gmax descriptors. From these descriptors, the Cu-containing SAC is predicted to exhibit the highest catalytic activity which is consistent with a theoretical overpotential of 0.71 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) only, indicating that this type of catalysts in oxygen depolarized cathodes (ODCs) may overcome the limitations of the high cost and low abundance of Pt and other precious metals.</description>

                Recently, chalcogenides have attracted much attention as electrocatalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, few studies have been conducted on the electrocatalytic properties of gallium oxides and chalcogenides. In this paper, a Ga2XY (X &#8800; Y, X, Y=O, S, Se, Te) defect structure doped by non-metal B, C, N, P, Si, and As have been designed. According to the study, the doping of non-metal atoms can significantly enhance their HER properties, the Ga2OSe-AsXi-Xi structure and Ga2SeTe-SiXi-NM structure possess intensely excellent HER properties in this study with the Gibbs free energy of 0.01 eV and 0.00 eV, respectively. It is found that the Ga2SeTe structure has a more concentrated electron transfer range compared to the Ga2OSe structure, leading to a superior HER performance. This work provides a new idea for the study of HER electrocatalytic performance of the Ga2XY system, and it is expected to be applied to HER catalysts affordably and efficiently.</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen production through hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) offers a promising solution to combat climate change by replacing fossil fuels with clean energy sources. However, the widespread adoption of efficient electrocatalysts, such as platinum (Pt), has been hindered by their high cost. In this study, we developed an easy-to-implement method to create ultrathin Pt nanomembranes, which catalyze HER at a cost significantly lower than commercial Pt/C and comparable to non-noble metal electrocatalysts. These Pt nanomembranes consist of highly distorted Pt nanocrystals and exhibit a heterogeneous elastic strain field, a characteristic rarely seen in conventional crystals. This unique feature results in significantly higher electrocatalytic efficiency than various forms of Pt electrocatalysts, including Pt/C, Pt foils, and numerous Pt single-atom or single-cluster catalysts. Our research offers a promising approach to develop highly efficient and cost-effective low-dimensional electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production, potentially addressing the challenges posed by the climate crisis.</description>

      <title>Developing Cheap but Useful Machine Learning-Based Models for Investigating High-Entropy Alloy Catalysts</title>

                This work aims to address the challenge of developing interpretable ML-based models when access to large-scale computational resources is limited. Using CoMoFeNiCu high-entropy alloy catalysts as an example, we present a cost-effective workflow that synergistically combines descriptor-based approaches, machine learning-based force fields, and low-cost density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict high-quality adsorption energies for H, N, and NHx (x = 1, 2, and 3) adsorbates. This is achieved using three specific modifications to typical DFT workflows including: (1) using a sequential optimization protocol, (2) developing a new geometry-based descriptor, and (3) repurposing the already-available low-cost DFT optimization trajectories to develop a ML-FF. Taken together, this study illustrates how cost-effective DFT calculations and appropriately designed descriptors can be used to develop cheap but useful models for predicting high-quality adsorption energies at significantly lower computational costs. We anticipate that this resource-efficient philosophy may be broadly relevant to the larger surface catalysis community.</description>

      <title>Engineering Symmetry-Breaking Centers and d-Orbital Modulation in Triatomic Catalysts for Zinc-Air Batteries</title>

                Unraveling the configuration&#8211;activity relationship and synergistic enhancement mechanism (such as real active center, electron spin-state, and d-orbital energy level) for triatomic catalysts, as well as their intrinsically bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis, is a great challenge. Here we present a triatomic catalyst (TAC) with a trinuclear active structure that displays extraordinary oxygen electrocatalysis for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), greatly outperforming the counterpart of single-atom and diatomic catalysts. The aqueous Zn-air battery (ZAB) equipped with a TAC-based cathode exhibits extraordinary rechargeable stability and ultrarobust cycling performance (1970 h/3940 cycles at 2 mA cm&#8211;2, 125 h/250 cycles at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 with negligible voltage decay), and the quasi-solid-state ZAB displays outstanding rechargeability and low-temperature adaptability (300 h/1800 cycles at 2 mA cm&#8211;2 at &#8722;60 &#176;C), outperforming other state-of-the-art ZABs. The experimental and theoretical analyses reveal the symmetry-breaking CoN4 configuration under incorporation of neighboring metal atoms (Fe and Cu), which leads to d-orbital modulation, a low-shift d band center, weakened binding strength to the oxygen intermediates, and decreased energy barrier for bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. This rational tricoordination design as well as an in-depth mechanism analysis indicate that hetero-TACs can be promisingly applied in various electrocatalysis applications.</description>

                The acceleration of materials discovery has gained paramount importance due to its potential to overcome constraints in emerging technologies. Extensive exploration has been undertaken into three pivotal approaches: combinatorial synthesis, high-throughput characterization, and computational techniques, all aimed at unveiling new materials. This review article delves into recent progress in these domains. Combinatorial synthesis, especially in the development of thin-film materials libraries, emerges as a potent method for efficiently generating comprehensive multinary materials systems and composition gradients spanning the entire spectrum of required compositions. High-throughput characterization techniques play a pivotal role in assessing the compositional, structural, and functional attributes of materials within these libraries, yielding multidimensional datasets. Concurrently, recent advancements in computational materials science have notably expedited the discovery process by enabling high-throughput calculations and simulations of potential materials systems. These collective endeavors foster a more robust correlation between composition, processing, structure, and properties, facilitating the forecast and design of future materials through data-driven materials discovery. This approach allows for efficient optimization of newly identified materials. Furthermore, materials informatics, an integral element of this process, plays a crucial role in managing and extracting valuable insights from the vast data generated during materials discovery.</description>

                Electrochemical membrane technology has been identified as a promising technology for sustainable chemical and energy production due to its potential to address several challenges in the production of chemicals and energy, including energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and waste generation. Electrochemical membrane processes can be applied to produce a wide range of feedstocks, including gases, liquids, and solids. This versatility can enable the coproduction of multiple chemicals and energy products from various feedstocks. In this chapter, the production of chemicals and energy, including bioelectricity, biomethane, biohydrogen, bioethanol, hydrogen peroxide, biodegradable electronics and biosensors, dry air from humid air, air separation into nitrogen and oxygen gases, organic solvent extraction, CO2 and H2 separation from gas mixtures, plasma generation, dewatered microalgae biomass, and purified microalgae-based products, are discussed. Electrochemical membrane processes can offer environmental benefits, such as CO2 reduction, leading to more sustainable and socially responsible production practices. The electrochemical conversion of CO2 can lead to the production of valuable chemicals, such as ethanol. With continued research and development, electrochemical membrane technology is expected to play an increasingly important role in chemical and energy production.</description>
