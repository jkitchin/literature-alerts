      <title>Synthesis of N/Fe/S-Codoped Cathode Catalysts on Gasification Residue Carbon for Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

                The gasification fine slag (GFS) contains a large amount of residual carbon (RC). The RC has a large specific surface area, a well-developed pore structure, and a wide pore size distribution. Therefore, oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts can be prepared using the RC and can be applied in zinc&#8211;air batteries. In this work, ORR catalysts were prepared by using the RC as precursors with N/Fe/S codoping. The codoping effect between different heteroatoms was investigated by combining physicochemical and electrochemical characterization. The results demonstrate that the N/Fe/S-codoped catalyst CKN6FeS has a high onset potential and average electron transfer number. In alkaline conditions, CKN6FeS exhibits catalytic activity comparable to that of commercial Pt/C and shows better methanol tolerance than that of Pt/C. It shows good catalytic ability in zinc&#8211;air batteries with good cycling stability and durability, achieving high power density and specific capacity.</description>

      <title>Microenvironment reconstitution of highly active Ni single atoms on oxygen-incorporated Mo2C for water splitting</title>

                Abstract The rational design of efficient bifunctional single-atom electrocatalysts for industrial water splitting and the comprehensive understanding of its complex catalytic mechanisms remain challenging. Here, we report a Ni single atoms supported on oxygen-incorporated Mo 2 C via Ni-O-Mo bridge bonds, that gives high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) bifunctional activity. By ex situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy and electron microscopy, we found that after HER, the coordination number and bond lengths of Ni-O and Ni-Mo (Ni-O-Mo) were all altered, yet the Ni species still remain atomically dispersed. In contrast, after OER, the atomically dispersed Ni were agglomerated into very small clusters with new Ni-Ni (Ni-O-Ni) bonds appeared. Combining experimental results and DFT calculations, we infer the oxidation degree of Mo 2 C and the configuration of single-atom Ni are both vital for HER or OER. This study provides both a feasible strategy and model to rational design highly efficient electrocatalysts for water electrolysis.</description>

      <title>Boosting hydrogen evolution kinetics of self-supported MoC-Mo2C heterojunction electrode by platinum decoration</title>

                Molybdenum carbide-based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts have attracted widespread attention with their low cost and relatively high catalytic activity. Despite the significant progress made in tuning the morphology and structure, the intrinsic catalytic activity of molybdenum carbide awaits further improvement. Herein, a Pt-decorated self-supported MoC-Mo2C electrode with super-intrinsic HER catalytic activity is prepared by a simple adsorption-electroreduction method. The HER performance is improved with increasing the loading of Pt. The optimal MoC-Mo2C-Pt heterojunction electrode has a low overpotential of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 (58 mV in H2SO4, 82 mV in KOH) and small Tafel slope (24 mV dec&#8722;1 in H2SO4, 29 mV dec&#8722;1 in KOH), which is reduced to 0.45-0.5, 0.7-0.8, and 0.4-0.7 times of pristine MoC-Mo2C, Pt foil, and commercial Pt/C (2 mg cm&#8722;2), respectively. The improved HER catalysis is attributed to the rapid dissociation of water on MoC-Mo2C and efficient desorption of hydrogen on Pt. Therefore, decorating carbides with Pt is an effective way to design HER catalysts with enhanced catalytic activities in a wide pH range.</description>

      <title>Free-Standing Single-Atom Catalyst-Based Electrodes for CO2 Reduction</title>

                Abstract Electrochemical CO 2 reduction technology could solve the CO 2 -induced climate warming by electrochemically converting atmospheric CO 2 back into fuel, essentially recycling it and building a low carbon emission economy. However, the electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) poses a significant challenge due to the highly stable and linear CO 2 molecules, in addition to a proton-coupled multi-electron transfer process. Thus, highly active catalysts, placed on activity bolstering materials, and permeable electrodes are crucial for CO 2 RR. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have recently garnered increasing interest in the electrocatalysis community due to their potentially high mass efficiency and cost benefits (every atom is an active center, resulting in nearly 100% utilization) and adjustable selectivity (higher uniformity of the active sites compared to nanoparticles). However, preserving the accessibility and activity of the SACs inside the electrode poses major materials development and electrode design challenges. A conventional layered structure SAC electrode typically consists of a gas diffusion layer (GDL), a microporous layer (MPL) and a SAC catalyst layer (SACCL), fabricated by using a powder bonding process. However, this process usually encounters issues such as delamination and instability of SACs due to the weak binder-catalyst-support interface. Conversely, the free-standing SAC electrode design has the potential to overcome these issues by eliminating the GDL, MPL, and need of a binder, in contrast to the powder bonding process. This work first reviews the latest developments in experimental and modeling studies of powdered SAC electrode by the traditional powder bonding process. Next, it examines the development towards the free-standing SAC electrode for high-performance electrochemical reduction of CO 2 . The synthesis-structure-fabrication-performance relationships of SAC-based materials and associated electrodes are analyzed. Furthermore, the article presents future challenges and perspectives for high-performance SAC electrodes for CO 2 RR. Graphical Abstract</description>

      <title>Transition Metals Based Dual Single&#8208;atom Catalysts for Oxygen Electrocatalysis: Stunning Advances and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202301392</link>
      <description>Saira Ajmal, Yang Zhao, Ghulam Yasin, Felix Ofori Boakye, Mohammad Tabish, Mohammed Mujahid Alam, Abdullah G. Al&#8208;Sehemi, Wei Zhao, ChemCatChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391778585

                Abstract During the past few years, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted considerable attention in electrolysis due to their outstanding catalytic performance and efficient atomic utilization. SACs exhibit a simple structure, high catalytic activity, consistent scaling relationships for single sites, and low metal content but their practical applications are still limited. Dual single&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), which feature excellent selectivity, high atomic utilization efficiency, and remarkable stability, are emerging as new frontiers in heterogeneous electrocatalysis. They increase catalytic activity by promoting synergistic effects between metal&#8208;active sites. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the latest developments in dual&#8208;atom catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In addition, we explore the differences between homonuclear and heteronuclear configurations, the emergence of single/dual&#8208;site metal catalysts, and the methods currently used for their synthesis. Lastly, this review discusses several perspectives for advancing the development of dual&#8208;atom catalysts for OER and ORR electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Selective Adsorption, Structure and Dynamics of Co2 &#8211; Ch4 Mixture in Mg-Mof-74 and the Influence of Intercrystalline Orientational Disorder</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4724684</link>

                Mg-MOF-74 is a highly efficient adsorbent for CO2 and is known to exhibit good performance in the separation of a CO2-CH4 mixture via selective adsorption. In this work we use molecular simulations to study the effects of disorder in Mg-MOF-74 on the selective adsorption, structure, and dynamics of a CO2-CH4 mixture. Positional disorder is introduced in the adsorbent by separating individual Mg-MOF-74 crystallites via inserting intercrystalline space between them. Rotating a crystallite with respect to others by different extents provides the orientational disorder (OD). Positional disorder is observed to enhance the adsorption selectivity of CO2 over CH4. The additional adsorption sites made available by exposing crystallite surfaces may provide added selectively for CO2. Mechanistically, solid-fluid interaction and associated dynamics at the additional sites is produced by predominantly an electrostatic affect. While OD in Mg-MOF-74 is found to have a rather weak effect on the rotation of CO2, its effects on the translational motion of CO2 are significant. This behavior follows a systematic pattern dictated by the interplay of the pore geometry of Mg-MOF-74 and Mg2+ - CO2 interactions. Our results provide a guide on how to tailor Mg-MOF-74 adsorption behavior with desired properties by purposeful introduction of OD.</description>

      <title>Enhancing hydrogen evolution reaction using iridium atomic monolayer on conventional electrodes: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.02.156</link>
      <description>Abdul Ahad Mamun, Asif Billah, Muhammad Anisuzzaman Talukder, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 59(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391798117

                In a water-electrolysis system for hydrogen production, the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) critically depend on the exchange current density (J0) of the electrode. Noble metals, e.g., Pt, Ir, Rh, and Au, offer a significant J0 when used as electrodes, assisting faster HER. However, instead of using expensive noble metals as electrodes, a thin layer on conventional electrodes, e.g., Ni, Cu, Ag, and Mo, also increases J0. An electrode&#8217;s J0 during HER is calculated from the free energy of hydrogen adsorption (&#916;GH), which is determined from hydrogen adsorption energy (Ead) on the electrode surface. This work considered an Ir atomic monolayer as an electrocatalyst on the (111) plane of conventional Ni, Cu, Ag, and Mo electrodes, producing modified Ir/Ni(111), Ir/Cu(111), Ir/Ag(111), and Ir/Mo(111) electrodes. This work calculated Ead of the modified electrodes using the density functional theory (DFT). In addition, this work develops an advanced kinetic model for the exchange current density considering the concentration of hydrogen ions (CH+) and partial pressure of hydrogen gas (PH2). The dependence of activation overpotential (&#951;a) vs. J0 relationship on CH+ and PH2 in HER is investigated. For the modified electrodes, J0 increases by 102&#8211;103 times compared to the conventional electrodes, resulting in efficient H2 production with low losses.</description>

      <title>Influence of mixing time on a reversal tolerant anode measured ex situ for a PEMFC</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.236</link>
      <description>S.J.T. Homan, Kerem Aylar, Adrian Jurjevi&#263;, M. Scolari, Atsushi Urakawa, Peyman Taheri, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 59(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391804977

                When no hydrogen can reach the Pt catalyst in the anode for the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) of an operating proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), the anode potential increases and causes the cell potential to be reversed compared to normal operation conditions. During this reversal, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and carbon oxidation reaction (COR) will occur at the anode, where the COR has devastating consequences for the electrode. Introducing an OER catalyst limits the COR to occur, which makes a reversal tolerant anode (RTA). In this research, RTAs are differentiated by applying different ball milling times during catalyst layer processing, forming big and small OER (IrOx/TiOx) and HOR (Pt/C) catalyst particles. The two different particle sizes were electrochemically tested using a rotating disc electrode (RDE). Both catalyst sizes show a decrease in OER activity (mA cm&#8722;2) accompanied by loss of the ionomer in a self-developed accelerated stress test (AST). The small particle RTAs show higher OER activity as a result of increased surface area. However, during a chronopotentiometry measurement, which mimics a fuel cell reversal, the small particle coatings show a worse reversal tolerance. This phenomenon can be attributed to the increased difficulty in removing oxygen bubbles.</description>

      <title>Fe-N-C core-shell catalysts with single low-spin Fe(&#8545;)-N4 species for oxygen reduction reaction and high-performance proton exchange membrane fuel cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jechem.2024.01.074</link>
      <description>Wei Yan, Linhui Yu, Binghua Yang, Caihong Li, Fang Chen, Wenlong Guo, Fang&#8208;Xing Xiao, Yangming Lin, Journal of Energy Chemistry. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391817857

                Fe-N-doped carbon materials (Fe-N-C) are promising candidates for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) relative to Pt-based catalysts in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, the intrinsic contributions of Fe-N4 moiety with different chemical/spin states (e.g. D1, D2, D3, etc.) to ORR are unclear since various states coexist inevitably. In the present work, Fe-N-C core-shell nanocatalyst with single low-spin Fe(&#8545;)-N4 species (D1) is synthesized and identified with ex-situ ultralow temperature M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy (T=1.6 K) that could essentially differentiate various Fe-N4 states and invisible Fe-O species. By quantifying with CO-pulse chemisorption, site density and turnover frequency of Fe-N-C catalysts reach 2.4&#215;1019 site g&#8722;1 and 23 e site&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 during the ORR, respectively. Half-wave potential (0.915 VRHE) of the Fe-N-C catalyst is more positive (approximately 54 mV) than that of Pt/C. Moreover, we observe that the performance of PEMFCs on Fe-N-C almost achieves the 2025 target of the US Department of Energy by demonstrating a current density of 1.037 A cm&#8722;2 combined with the peak power density of 0.685 W cm&#8722;2, suggesting the critical role of Fe(&#8545;)-N4 site (D1). After 500 h of running, PEMFCs still deliver a power density of 1.26 W cm&#8722;2 at 1.0 bar H2-O2. An unexpected rate-determining step is figured out by isotopic labelling experiment and theoretical calculation. This work not only offers valuable insights regarding the intrinsic contribution of Fe-N4 with a single spin state to alkaline/acidic ORR, but also provides great opportunities for developing high-performance stable PEMFCs.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Polaritonic Chemistry: Accessing Chemical Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c12829</link>
      <description>Christian Sch&#228;fer, Jakub Fojt, Eric Lindgren, Paul Erhart, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391824217

                Altering chemical reactivity and material structure in confined optical environments is on the rise, and yet, a conclusive understanding of the microscopic mechanisms remains elusive. This originates mostly from the fact that accurately predicting vibrational and reactive dynamics for soluted ensembles of realistic molecules is no small endeavor, and adding (collective) strong light&#8211;matter interaction does not simplify matters. Here, we establish a framework based on a combination of machine learning (ML) models, trained using density-functional theory calculations and molecular dynamics to accelerate such simulations. We then apply this approach to evaluate strong coupling, changes in reaction rate constant, and their influence on enthalpy and entropy for the deprotection reaction of 1-phenyl-2-trimethylsilylacetylene, which has been studied previously both experimentally and using ab initio simulations. While we find qualitative agreement with critical experimental observations, especially with regard to the changes in kinetics, we also find differences in comparison with previous theoretical predictions. The features for which the ML-accelerated and ab initio simulations agree show the experimentally estimated kinetic behavior. Conflicting features indicate that a contribution of dynamic electronic polarization to the reaction process is more relevant than currently believed. Our work demonstrates the practical use of ML for polaritonic chemistry, discusses limitations of common approximations, and paves the way for a more holistic description of polaritonic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Size tuning of Pt nanoparticles on ZrO2: Optimizing catalytic performance for hydrogen evolution and water-splitting reactions - A DFT study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.02.142</link>

                In heterogeneous catalysis, determining the optimal metal particle size is challenging due to the intricate relationship between particle size, electronic structure, and activity. Here, we investigate the size-dependent activity of Pt nanoparticle (PtNP)-based ZrO2 catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and water-splitting reaction (WSR) using density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. By analyzing different Pt nanoparticle sizes (Pt4, Pt7, Pt11, P15, Pt19, and Pt25) supported on ZrO2, we determined their optimized geometries, and electronic structures, and calculated the hydrogen adsorption energies (&#916;GH) for HER and activation energies barrier (&#916;&#8225;G) for WSR. The calculated results demonstrate that Pt11 is the optimal size for HER, exhibiting the lowest &#916;GH (&#8722;0.066 eV), while Pt15 shows the lowest &#916;&#8225;G (0.24 eV) for WSR. The density of states (DOS) shows that the occupied Pt states fill the gap of ZrO2 (3.72 eV), significantly reducing the band gap (Eg) of the PtNP/ZrO2 composites. The most favorable configuration of the PtNP on ZrO2 for HER and WSR is determined to be a three-Pt-layer structure with rooflike edges which corresponds to a nanoparticle size of &#8764;0.70&#8211;1.55 nm for experiments. These findings can be regarded as an effort toward the design and optimization of metal-based oxide catalysts for renewable energy applications.</description>

                The removal of CO2 (called &#8220;upgrading&#8221;) is essential in bio-H2 production processes including dark fermentation (DF), which is energy-intensive and adds economic burden. Here, it was attempted to generate high-calorific bio-H2 (high H2-content) directly from the fermenter under high pressure in the presence of Ca2+. High pressure was automatically generated by holding the produced gas at a certain limit.Batch test results showed that Ca2+ addition was helpful to keep the pH by precipitating with dissolved CO2, resulting in the gradual increase of H2 content to 93% at 17.5 bar (vs. 77% at 11.2 bar in the control). Then, the theoretical approaches, based on balance and equilibrium equations, were made to investigate the effects of Ca2+ addition at different dosages (0-1 g CaCl2/L) under different pressures during continuous operation. It was found that the H2 content around 90% at the permissible pressure (&#8804;10 bar) can be only achieved at 1 g CaCl2/L addition. Lastly, continuous operation of DF was conducted in an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor fed with glucose (10 g COD/L) with 1 g CaCl2/L addition. The H2 content in bio-H2 gradually increased with the pressure increase, from 49.5% at 1 bar to 84.9% at 9 bar. No distinct changes in morphological and physico-chemical properties were observed in the granules exposed at different pressures. Although there was a drop in the amount of H2 produced due to the increase in dissolved H2 and metabolic shift as pressure increased, the decrease in upgrading cost made high-pressure DF economically feasible.</description>

                Fast cation transport in solids underpins energy storage. Materials design has focused on structures that can define transport pathways with minimal cation coordination change, restricting attention to a small part of chemical space. Motivated by the greater structural diversity of binary intermetallics than that of the metallic elements, we used two anions to build a pathway for three-dimensional superionic lithium ion conductivity that exploits multiple cation coordination environments. Li 7 Si 2 S 7 I is a pure lithium ion conductor created by an ordering of sulphide and iodide that combines elements of hexagonal and cubic close-packing analogously to the structure of NiZr. The resulting diverse network of lithium positions with distinct geometries and anion coordination chemistries affords low barriers to transport, opening a large structural space for high cation conductivity.</description>

                Developing highly active cluster catalysts for the bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is significant for future renewable energy technology. Here, we employ first-principles calculations combined with a genetic algorithm to explore the activity trends of transition metal clusters supported on C2N. Our results indicate that the supported clusters, as bifunctional catalysts for the OER and the ORR, may outperform single-atom catalysts. In particular, the C2N-supported Ag6 cluster exhibits outstanding bifunctional activity with low overpotentials. Mechanistic analysis indicates that the activity of the cluster is related to the number of atoms in the active site as well as the interaction between the intermediate and the cluster. Accordingly, we identify a descriptor that links the intrinsic properties of the clusters with the activity of both the OER and the ORR. This work provides guidelines and strategies for the rational design of highly efficient bifunctional cluster catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Rationally designing of highly efficient electrocatalysts is critical to improving hydrogen production by water electrolysis. However, bottlenecks still require consideration when optimizing the intrinsic performance of electrocatalysts. Applying appropriate external fields to catalytic systems may effectively overcome such bottlenecks and enhance the performance of catalysts. Among various external fields, the magnetic field has received extensive attention owing to its multifunctionality, non&#8208;contact nature, and non&#8208;invasiveness, thereby requiring more research and development. In this review, recent advances in magnetic field&#8208;assisted water electrolysis are systematically outlined. Firstly, the diverse methods used for pre&#8208;regulating catalysts under magnetic fields, including optimized nucleation, induction heating, and directed growth, are discussed. It then explores the effects of magnetic fields on electrochemical processes, including magnetothermal, magnetohydrodynamic, and induced electric impact. Then, the influences of magnetic fields on the intrinsic properties of catalysts, such as spin polarization and spin reconstruction effects, are addressed. Finally, a discussion of the potential perspectives of magnetic field&#8208;enhanced water splitting, including catalyst design, experimental precision, and in situ characterization, are then provided to guide further research.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Structural Optimization for the Supported Metal System Based on Hybrid Approach Combining Bayesian Optimization with Local Search</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c01265</link>

                Numerous systematic methods have been developed to search for the global minimum of the potential energy surface, which corresponds to the optimal atomic structure. However, the majority of them still demand a substantial computing load due to the relaxation process that is embedded as an inner step inside the algorithm. Here, we propose a hybrid approach that combines Bayesian optimization (BO) and a local search that circumvents the relaxation step and efficiently finds the optimum structure, particularly in supported metal systems. The hybridization strategy combining the capabilities of BO&#8217;s effective exploration and the local search&#8217;s fast convergence expedites structural search. In addition, the formulation of physical constraints regarding the materials system and the feature of screening structure similarity enhance the computational efficiency of the proposed method. The proposed algorithm is demonstrated in two supported metal systems, showing the potential of the proposed method in the field of structural optimization.</description>

      <title>Electron transport kinetics via ZnO with ultralow Fe dopant for stable oxygen reduction to H2O2</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.149527</link>

                The two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a promising approach to obtain hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from oxygen in a friend manner. However, the 4e&#8722; ORR being the thermodynamically preferred route to H2O is always competes with the 2e&#8722; route. Herein, the ultralow iron was doped into ZnO through a solution combustion synthesis to construct an active and stable catalyst for 2e&#8722; ORR. In alkaline conditions, the catalyst exhibits a H2O2 production rate of 3.8 mol gcat&#8722;1h&#8722;1 and selectivity of more than 95 % with a Faraday efficiency of 88.6 % &#177; 2.2 %. More importantly, it shows a negligible activity decay with a durability of 500 h, representing the best stability performance among all the metal oxide catalysts. Furthermore, the catalyst exhibits an efficient electrochemical degradation ability of model organic pollutants in alkaline conditions. Experiments and theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the substitution defects generated by trace Fe doping promote the interfacial 2e&#8722; ORR transfer rate, leading to a high H2O2 selectivity. This work provides a facile but efficient strategy for the construction of carbon-free metal oxide electrocatalysts for H2O2 production.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Evolution Mediated by Sulphur Vacancies and Substitutional Mn in Few-Layered Molybdenum Disulphide</title>

                MoS2 is widely praised as a promising replacement for Pt as electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), but even today, it still suffers from low performance. This issue is tackled by using Mn3+ as surface modifier to trigger sulphur vacancy formation and enhance electron transport in few-layered 2H MoS2. Only 10 at% of Mn is sufficient to transform the semiconductive MoS2 into an active HER electrocatalyst. The insertion of Mn reduces both HER onset potential and Tafel slope which allows to reach -100 mA cm-2 at an overpotential of 206 mV, ten times larger of what undoped MoS2 can achieve. The enhanced activity arises because Mn3+ introduces electronic states near the conduction band, promote sulphur vacancies, and increases the hydrogen adsorption. In addition to its facile production and extended shelf-life, Mn-MoS2 exhibit an efficiency of 73% at 800 mA cm-2@2.0 V when used in proton exchange membrane water electrolysers.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation on the strain engineering control of TiC as tunable high-efficiency bifunctional cathode materials for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur batteries</title>

                Developing efficient cathode materials and strategies to suppress the shuttle effect and promote the reaction kinetics were the key scientific issues for the development of high performance lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Modify the properties of a material through strain engineering is an effective strategy to enhance the performance of adsorption and catalysis ability for special species. In this paper, first-principles calculations were carried out to investigate the anchoring effect and electrochemical performance of TiC(0 0 1) subjected to biaxial symmetric mechanical (compressive and tensile) strains. The results demonstrate that the adsorption energies of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) were enhanced monotonically and the metallic properties were also remaining along with the compressive strain to tensile strain. In addition, an appropriate strain could reduce the migration barrier of Li ions, the dissociation barrier of Li2S and the Gibbs free energy of the sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) to realize the rapid charge/discharge processes. Especially, the p-band center of carbon atoms in TiC was proposed as an effective descriptor to identify the adsorption and catalysis ability of the anchoring materials under biaxial strain. Our results indicate that strain engineering is a promising strategy to improve the comprehensive performance of anchoring materials in Li &#8722; S batteries.</description>

      <title>Novel nanotubes based on methylene-bridged cycloparaphenyleneas as highly efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                Nanotubes constructed from methylene-bridged cycloparaphenyleneas (MCPPs) are investigated using density functional theory. The dynamical stability is indicated by the real vibrational frequencies of the infrared spectra. MCPPs are semiconductors with an energy gap of &#8764; 2.9 eV that significantly decreases in the finite nanotubes. This decrease is a result of the interactive molecular orbitals that are localized at the pentagonal rings linking MCPPs. The UV-vis spectra show that transitions from the highest occupied and neighbor orbitals to the lowest unoccupied orbital dominate the primary absorption peaks. Oxygen evolution reaction shows that all the reaction intermediates, HO, O, and HOO are adsorbed by the pentagonal active sites. The considered nanotubes show good catalytic performance but the best performance is observed in the wider nanotubes with an overpotential of 0.10 V. This remarkably low overpotential in addition to the abundant active sites makes finite nanotubes from MCPPs exceptional catalysts for oxygen evolution.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Effects of Varying the Ti Concentration on the Mechanical Properties of Cu&#8211;Ti Alloys</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c07561</link>
      <description>Vasileios Fotopoulos, Corey S. O&#8217;Hern, Mark D. Shattuck, Alexander L. Shluger, ACS Omega. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391933315

                The mechanical properties of CuTi alloys have been characterized extensively through experimental studies. However, a detailed understanding of why the strength of Cu increases after a small fraction of Ti atoms are added to the alloy is still missing. In this work, we address this question using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the modified embedded atom method (MEAM) interatomic potentials. First, we performed calculations of the uniaxial tension deformations of small bicrystalline Cu cells using DFT static simulations. We then carried out uniaxial tension deformations on much larger bicrystalline and polycrystalline Cu cells by using MEAM MD simulations. In bicrystalline Cu, the inclusion of Ti increases the grain boundary separation energy and the maximum tensile stress. The DFT calculations demonstrate that the increase in the tensile stress can be attributed to an increase in the local charge density arising from Ti. MEAM simulations in larger bicrystalline systems have shown that increasing the Ti concentration decreases the density of the stacking faults. This observation is enhanced in polycrystalline Cu, where the addition of Ti atoms, even at concentrations as low as 1.5 atomic (at.) %, increases the yield strength and elastic modulus of the material compared to pure Cu. Under uniaxial tensile loading, the addition of small amounts of Ti hinders the formation of partial Shockley dislocations in the grain boundaries of Cu, leading to a reduced level of local deformation. These results shed light on the role of Ti in determining the mechanical properties of polycrystalline Cu and enable the engineering of grain boundaries and the inclusion of Ti to improve degradation resistance.</description>
