                High performance catalysts are crucial to generating clean fuels, reducing the impact of global warming, and providing solutions to environmental pollution. Improved processes for catalyst design and a better understanding of catalytic processes are key for improving the effectiveness and activities. HEAs typically have at least four principal elements, this atomic structure gives them unique properties that have applications and excellent performance in a variety of fields including catalysis. The complexity of HEAs makes challenge for computational researchers, providing promising opportunities for the application of machine learning. Recent advances in data science have great potential to accelerate catalyst research, particularly the rapid exploration of large materials chemistry spaces through machine learning. Here a comprehensive and critical review of machine learning techniques used in HEA catalysis research is provided. Sources of HEA catalyst data and current approaches to represent these materials by mathematical features are described, the most commonly used machine learning methods summarized, and the quality and utility of catalyst models evaluated. Illustrations of how machine learning models are applied to novel HEA catalysts discovery and used to reveal catalytic reaction mechanisms are provided.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned atomic cluster expansion potentials for fast and quantum-accurate thermal simulations of wurtzite AlN</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0188905</link>
      <description>Yang Guang, Y. Liu, Lei Yang, Bing&#8208;Yang Cao, Journal of Applied Physics. 135(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392048091

                Thermal transport in wurtzite aluminum nitride (w-AlN) significantly affects the performance and reliability of corresponding electronic devices, particularly when lattice strains inevitably impact the thermal properties of w-AlN in practical applications. To accurately model the thermal properties of w-AlN with high efficiency, we develop a machine learning interatomic potential based on the atomic cluster expansion (ACE) framework. The predictive power of the ACE potential against density functional theory (DFT) is demonstrated across a broad range of properties of w-AlN, including ground-state lattice parameters, specific heat capacity, coefficients of thermal expansion, bulk modulus, and harmonic phonon dispersions. Validation of lattice thermal conductivity is further carried out by comparing the ACE-predicted values to the DFT calculations and experiments, exhibiting the overall capability of our ACE potential in sufficiently describing anharmonic phonon interactions. As a practical application, we perform a lattice dynamics analysis using the potential to unravel the effects of biaxial strains on thermal conductivity and phonon properties of w-AlN, which is identified as a significant tuning factor for near-junction thermal design of w-AlN-based electronics.</description>

                Academic departments, research clusters and evaluators analyze author and citation data to measure research impact and to support strategic planning. We created Scholar Metrics Scraper (SMS) to automate the retrieval of bibliometric data for a group of researchers. The project contains Jupyter notebooks that take a list of researchers as an input and exports a CSV file of citation metrics from Google Scholar (GS) to visualize the group's impact and collaboration. A series of graph outputs are also available. SMS is an open solution for automating the retrieval and visualization of citation data.</description>

                Plasmonic photocatalysis has been limited by the high cost and scalability of plasmonic materials, such as Ag and Au. By focusing on earth-abundant photocatalyst/plasmonic materials (HxMoO3) and Pd as a catalyst, we addressed these challenges by developing a solventless mechanochemical synthesis of Pd/HxMoO3 and optimizing photocatalytic activities in the visible range. We investigated the effect of HxMoO3 band gap excitation (at 427 nm), Pd interband transitions (at 427 nm), and HxMoO3 localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) excitation (at 640 nm) over photocatalytic activities toward the hydrogen evolution and phenylacetylene hydrogenation as model reactions. Although both excitation wavelengths led to comparable photoenhancements, a 110% increase was achieved under dual excitation conditions (427 + 640 nm). This was assigned to a synergistic effect of optical excitations that optimized the generation of energetic electrons at the catalytic sites. These results are important for the development of visible-light photocatalysts based on earth-abundant components.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional SiH/g-C3N4 van der Waals Type-II Heterojunction Photocatalyst: A New Effective and Promising Photocatalytic Material</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings14030263</link>
      <description>Qi Wang, Qian Zhu, Lei Cao, Liangdong Fan, Feng Gu, Ying Zhang, Cao Zheng, Shixian Xiong, Liang Xu, Coatings. 14(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392081661

                The two-dimensional layered heterostructure have been demonstrated as an effective method for achieving efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. In this work, we propose, for the first time, the creation of van der Waals heterostructures from monolayers of SiH and g-C3N4 using first-principle calculations. We also systematically investigated additional properties for the first time, such as the electronic structure and optical behavior of van der Waals heterostructures composed of SiH and g-C3N4 monolayers. The results of this study show that the SiH/g-C3N4 heterostructure is categorized as a type-II heterostructure, which has a bandgap of 2.268 eV. Furthermore, the SiH/g-C3N4 heterostructure interface was observed to efficiently separate and transfer photogenerated charges, resulting in an enhanced photocatalytic redox performance. Moreover, the calculation of HOMO (Highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (Least unoccupied molecular orbital) and charge density difference can further confirm that the SiH/g-C3N4 heterojunction is a type-II heterojunction, which has excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production and water decomposition performance. In addition, the SiH/g-C3N4 heterostructure exhibited excellent HER (Hydrogen evolution reaction) efficiency. This is essential for the process of photocatalytic water splitting. In SiH/g-C3N4 heterojunctions, the redox potential required for water splitting is spanned by the band edge potential. Calculating the absorption spectra, it was discovered that the SiH/g-C3N4 heterostructure possesses outstanding optical properties within the visible-light range, implying its high efficiency in photocatalytic hydrogen production. This research provides a broader research direction for the investigation of novel efficient photocatalysts and offers effective theoretical guidance for future efficient photocatalysts.</description>

                Catalytic performance of single-atom catalysts (SACs) relies fundamentally on the electronic nature and local coordination environment of the active site. Here, based on a machine-learning (ML)-aided density functional theory (DFT) method, we reveal that the intrinsic dipole in Janus materials has a significant impact on the catalytic activity of SACs, using 2D &#947;-phosphorus carbide (&#947;-PC) as a model system. Specifically, a local dipole around the active site is a key degree to tune the catalytic activity and can be used as an important descriptor with a high feature importance of 17.1% in predicting the difference of adsorption free energy (&#916;GO* &#8211; &#916;GOH*) to assess the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction. As a result, the catalytic performance of SACs can be tuned by an intrinsic dipole, in stark contrast to those external stimuli strategies previously used. These results suggest that dipole engineering and the revolutionary DFT-ML hybrid scheme are novel approaches for designing high-performance catalysts.</description>

      <title>Protective effects of Pt-N-C single-atom nanozymes against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury</title>

                Abstract Effective therapeutic strategies for myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury remain elusive. Targeting reactive oxygen species (ROS) provides a practical approach to mitigate myocardial damage following reperfusion. In this study, we synthesize an antioxidant nanozyme, equipped with a single-Platinum (Pt)-atom (PtsaN-C), for protecting against I/R injury. PtsaN-C exhibits multiple enzyme-mimicking activities for ROS scavenging with high efficiency and stability. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that the excellent ROS-elimination performance of the single Pt atom center precedes that of the Pt cluster center, owing to its better synergistic effect and metallic electronic property. Systematic in vitro and in vivo studies confirm that PtsaN-C efficiently counteracts ROS, restores cellular homeostasis and prevents apoptotic progression after I/R injury. PtsaN-C also demonstrates good biocompatibility, making it a promising candidate for clinical applications. Our study expands the scope of single-atom nanozyme in combating ROS-induced damage and offers a promising therapeutic avenue for the treatment of I/R injury.</description>

                Abstract Electrocatalytic water splitting seems to be an efficient strategy to deal with increasingly serious environmental problems and energy crises but still suffers from the lack of stable and efficient electrocatalysts. Designing practical electrocatalysts by introducing defect engineering, such as hybrid structure, surface vacancies, functional modification, and structural distortions, is proven to be a dependable solution for fabricating electrocatalysts with high catalytic activities, robust stability, and good practicability. This review is an overview of some relevant reports about the effects of defect engineering on the electrocatalytic water splitting performance of electrocatalysts. In detail, the types of defects, the preparation and characterization methods, and catalytic performances of electrocatalysts are presented, emphasizing the effects of the introduced defects on the electronic structures of electrocatalysts and the optimization of the intermediates' adsorption energy throughout the review. Finally, the existing challenges and personal perspectives of possible strategies for enhancing the catalytic performances of electrocatalysts are proposed. An in&#8208;depth understanding of the effects of defect engineering on the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts will light the way to design high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for water splitting and other possible applications.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Composition of the Metal Dimer Site in Chabazite for Direct Methane-to-Methanol Conversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c06635</link>

                Methanol is a liquid energy carrier that has the potential to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Industrial production of methanol is currently a multistep high-temperature/high-pressure synthesis route. Direct conversion of methane to methanol under low-temperature and low-pressure conditions is an interesting but challenging alternative, which presently lacks suitable catalysts. Here, the complete reaction cycle for direct methane-to-methanol conversion over transition-metal dimers in the chabazite zeolite is studied by using density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling. In particular, a reaction mechanism previously identified for the Cu2 dimer is explored under dry and wet conditions for dimers composed of Ag, Au, Pd, Ni, Co, Fe, and Zn and the bimetallic dimers AuCu, PdCu, and AuPd. The density-functional-theory-based microkinetic modeling shows that Cu2, AuPd, and PdCu dimers have reasonable turnover frequencies under technologically relevant conditions. The adsorption energy of atomic oxygen is identified as a descriptor for the reaction landscape as it correlates with the adsorption and transition-state energies of the other reaction intermediates. Using the established scaling relations, a volcano plot of the rate is generated with its apex close to the Cu2, AuPd, and PdCu dimers.</description>

                Developing bifunctional oxygen electrode materials with superior activity for oxygen reduction (ORR) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions is essential for advancing regenerative fuel cell and rechargeable metal&#8211;air battery technologies. This present work deals with the synthesis and characterization of electrocatalysts containing Pt and Ni nanoparticles supported on nitrogen-doped mixed metal oxides (Mn2O3-NiO) and the systematic evaluation of their bifunctional ORR/OER performance in an alkaline medium. These electrocatalysts have been successfully synthesized by a simple and fast microwave method. PtNi/Mn2O3-NiO-N with a binary metal oxide-to-N ratio of 1:2 demonstrated the best performance among the studied materials regarding bifunctional electrocatalytic activity (&#8710;E = 0.96 V) and robust stability.</description>

                The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a highly intended strategy of producing ammonia. However, several drawbacks, such as the weak adsorption energy of the N2 molecules on catalyst surfaces, the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the low catalytic activity and selectivity of the used electrocatalysts, make it challenging to increase the NH3 production yield and the Faradaic efficiency (FE). The single-atom electrocatalyst (SAC) is a new category of 0 D nanoparticles that received great attention in the electrocatalysis field and showed satisfactory performance for the NRR. This chapter provides a brief insight into the recent progress of the experimental and theoretical investigations of NRR on SACs, FE, mechanism pathways, and HER suppression. Besides, the origin of the activity, stability, and selectivity of the SACs toward NRR are discussed. Finally, the challenges for the fabrication of new efficient materials are provided.</description>

      <title>How transformative are transformative agreements? Evidence from Germany across disciplines</title>

                Abstract Research institutions across the globe attempt to change the academic publishing system as digitization opens up new opportunities, and subscriptions to the large journal bundles of the leading publishers put library budgets under pressure. One approach is the negotiation of so-called transformative agreements. I study the &#8216;DEAL&#8217; contracts between nearly all German research institutions and Springer Nature and Wiley. I investigate 6.1 million publications in 5,862 journals covering eight fields in the years 2016&#8211;2022 and apply a causal difference-in-differences design to identify whether the likelihood of a paper appearing in an eligible journal increases. The effect strongly depends on the discipline. While material science, chemistry, and economics s tend to hift towards these journals, all other disciplines in my sample do not react. Suggestive evidence hints at the market position of the encompassed publishers before the &#8216;DEAL&#8217; was established: Springer Nature and Wiley appear to benefit more from the contracts in disciplines in which they possessed a higher market share ex ante. The transformative vigor of these agreements in terms of publication behavior seems to be limited. It and highlights that the developments in this intertwined market require further examination.</description>

      <title>Local-environment-guided selection of atomic structures for the development of machine-learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0187892</link>
      <description>Renzhe Li, Chuan Zhou, Amankumar Singh, Yong Pei, Graeme Henkelman, Lei Li, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 160(7)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392014929

                Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have attracted significant attention in computational chemistry and materials science due to their high accuracy and computational efficiency. The proper selection of atomic structures is crucial for developing reliable MLPs. Insufficient or redundant atomic structures can impede the training process and potentially result in a poor quality MLP. Here, we propose a local-environment-guided screening algorithm for efficient dataset selection in MLP development. The algorithm utilizes a local environment bank to store unique local environments of atoms. The dissimilarity between a particular local environment and those stored in the bank is evaluated using the Euclidean distance. A new structure is selected only if its local environment is significantly different from those already present in the bank. Consequently, the bank is then updated with all the new local environments found in the selected structure. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we applied it to select structures for a Ge system and a Pd13H2 particle system. The algorithm reduced the training data size by around 80% for both without compromising the performance of the MLP models. We verified that the results were independent of the selection and ordering of the initial structures. We also compared the performance of our method with the farthest point sampling algorithm, and the results show that our algorithm is superior in both robustness and computational efficiency. Furthermore, the generated local environment bank can be continuously updated and can potentially serve as a growing database of feature local environments, aiding in efficient dataset maintenance for constructing accurate MLPs.</description>

      <title>Informative Training Data for Efficient Property Prediction in Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks by Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c13687</link>
      <description>Antonio San Jos&#233;, &#201;milie Devijver, N. Jakse, Roberta Poloni, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392167663

                In recent data-driven approaches to material discovery, scenarios where target quantities are expensive to compute and measure are often overlooked. In such cases, it becomes imperative to construct a training set that includes the most diverse, representative, and informative samples. Here, a novel regression tree-based active learning algorithm is employed for such a purpose. It is applied to predict the band gap and adsorption properties of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), a novel class of materials that results from the virtually infinite combinations of their building units. Simpler and low dimensional descriptors, such as those based on stoichiometric and geometric properties, are used to compute the feature space for this model owing to their ability to better represent MOFs in the low data regime. The partitions given by a regression tree constructed on the labeled part of the data set are used to select new samples to be added to the training set, thereby limiting its size while maximizing the prediction quality. Tests on the QMOF, hMOF, and dMOF data sets reveal that our method constructs small training data sets to learn regression models that predict the target properties more efficiently than existing active learning approaches, and with lower variance. Specifically, our active learning approach is highly beneficial when labels are unevenly distributed in the descriptor space and when the label distribution is imbalanced, which is often the case for real world data. The regions defined by the tree help in revealing patterns in the data, thereby offering a unique tool to efficiently analyze complex structure&#8211;property relationships in materials and accelerate materials discovery.</description>
