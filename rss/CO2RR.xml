      <title>An Electrochemical Reduction Cell Model of Photosynthesis for Carbon Dioxide Capture</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5083012</link>

                Since carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have increased at unprecedented rate over the last ten years, global warming has become an increasingly pressing concern for humanity. This work suggests a sustainable solution to this issue by employing a unique mechanism that uses sunlight and electricity to transform CO2 into useful fuel. To construct the device, a Simulink model of the electrochemical reduction cell was created. The model essentially transforms photovoltaic power, CO2 and water into other chemical products. Using the reversible, activation and ohmic equations, the voltage needed to run the CO2 reduction cell was determined. As the anode, cathode, and voltage source blocks are the three main models that make up the CO2 electrolyser cell, the production flow rates of formic acid and oxygen were also evaluated based on molar and charge balances, as well as continuity equations at operating conditions of 1 atm and 298 K. The simulation predicts about 176 kg of CO2 consumption in 10 seconds of the electrochemical conversion. Therefore, the implication of this study is to justify photosynthesis as electrochemical reduction process to efficiently mitigate the accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere.</description>

      <description>Xu Han, Haotian Wang, Yijie Zhang, Yuting Tan, Xiaomeng Lv, Catalysts. 15(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406012791

                The electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) into high-value-added products is considered to be a promising way to mitigate carbon emissions. However, it remains a challenge to design an efficient catalyst with an excellent performance. In this work, we synthesized a metal azole framework (MAF) by changing 2-methylimidazole ligands into 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole (MMT) for use as organic linkers and mercaptan groups as anchoring sites for the Ag nanoparticles. The Ag NPs@ MAF-MMT material displayed a wide potential window from &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.2 V vs. RHE, with a maximum CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) over 90.5%, and a current density of 18 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1 V vs. RHE for 11 h in an H-cell. This work provides a new option to immobilize Ag nanoparticles in MAFs material for the exploration of carbon dioxide reduction catalysts.</description>

      <title>Precise Regulation of In Situ Exsolution Components of Nanoparticles for Constructing Active Interfaces toward Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>

      <description>Luo Yao, Chang Xu, Jietao Wang, Dong Zhang, Lei Fu, Xiang&#8208;Kui Gu, Yao Wang, Tong Liu, Mingyue Ding, ACS Nano. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406010230

                Metal nanocatalysts supported on oxide scaffolds have been widely used in energy storage and conversion reactions. So far, the main research is still focused on the growth, density, size, and activity enhancement of exsolved nanoparticles (NPs). However, the lack of precise regulation of the type and composition of NPs elements under reduction conditions has restricted the architectural development of in situ exsolution systems. Herein, we propose a strategy to attain a regulated distribution of exsolved transition metals (Cu, Ni, and Fe) on Sr2Fe1.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Mo0.4O6&#8211;&#948; medium-entropy perovskite oxides by varying the oxygen partial pressure (pO2) gradient in the mixture. At 800 &#176;C, the unitary Cu, binary Cu&#8211;Ni, and ternary Cu&#8211;Ni&#8211;Fe NPs are exsolved as pO2 decreases from high to low. Combining experimental and theoretical simulations, we further corroborate that solid oxide electrolysis cells with ternary alloy clusters at the CNF@SFO interface exhibit superior CO2 electrolytic performance. Our results provide tailored strategies for nanostructures and nanointerfaces for studying metal oxide exsolution systems, including fuel electrode materials.</description>

      <title>Optimizing oil recovery and emissions reduction through co2 injection in mature offshore fields</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.37878/2708-0080/2024-5.13</link>
      <description>B.S. Akhymbayeva, Neft i gaz. 143(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406055596

                The article explores the potential of CO2 injection technology for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and simultaneous reduction of carbon emissions through storage in oil reservoirs and aquifers. The study focuses on 23 oil fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, identified as promising candidates for implementing this technology. The model used in the research assesses the economic and technical feasibility of CO2 injection, along with the integration of EOR and long-term carbon storage. The primary goal is to demonstrate that injecting 70 million tons of CO2 annually over 40 years can result in an additional oil recovery of 5.9%-7.6% of the original oil in place, equivalent to 276-351 million cubic meters. Excess CO2 can be stored in aquifers, further contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions. The article outlines key aspects of the study, including economic and technical parameters, such as costs associated with CO2 transportation, storage, and drilling of new wells, as well as various oil and CO2 price scenarios. The environmental benefits of the project are highlighted, showing that the significant CO2 retained in oil reservoirs and aquifers compensates for emissions from the combustion of recovered oil. The study also discusses the features of the model, including scenarios for continuous CO2 injection and considerations of infrastructure costs. The article emphasizes the importance of developing and implementing such projects in the context of global climate change mitigation efforts and points to the significant potential of CO2 injection technology for the oil industry. The aim of this article is to evaluate the feasibility and potential benefits of large-scale CO2 injection for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and long-term carbon storage in oil fields and aquifers. The study seeks to demonstrate how CO2 injection can increase oil recovery rates while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions, providing a comprehensive technical-economic assessment of the process. Through the analysis of 23 oil fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, the article aims to present the economic, environmental, and operational advantages of integrating CO2 storage with EOR operations.</description>

      <title>The Other Carbon Capture: The U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s Tackling of CO2 and CH4 for Effective Global Carbon Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5068336</link>
      <description>Jos&#233; Figueroa, Jared Ciferno, Dan H&#226;ncu, Richard Baker, Katrine Hahn, Stephen L. Henry, Markus Drouven, William Fincham, SSRN Electronic Journal. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406100517

                Carbon dioxide (CO2) has historically been the primary focus of carbon management programs and portfolios driven by increasing atmospheric levels that reached approximately 36.8 billion tonnes in 2022, which amounted to a 0.9% increase over the previous year. Early carbon management efforts concentrated largely on large point sources like the fossil energy power generation sector, primarily coal. More recently, the scope has broadened to include natural gas power generation and the more challenging-to-address industrial sector. Over the past five years, there has been a notable effort to address the latter harder-to-abate industrial and commercial sectors through carbon dioxide reduction (CDR). Furthermore, there is a growing recognition that establishing a compelling business case is essential to enable widespread implementation to meet the climate change targets of 1.5&#176;C or 2&#176;C scenarios. Methane (CH4) has been regarded as the transition fossil fuel alternative to coal for over a decade due to its low carbon intensity, abundance, worldwide portability, and potential to be integrated into existing point source facilities. Among the various greenhouse gases, some with higher global warming potential, CH4 is the one carbon-based species that has the inherent potential to be the most impactful for tackling climate change while also having the potential of no net cost since captured emissions can offset the cost of abatement. The global priority of addressing methane emissions is underscored by the Global Methane Pledge that originated at COP26 and was expanded at COP28. The importance of reducing methane emissions was demonstrated by The White House Office of Domestic Policy's U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan and Executive Order 14057 to lead the Federal Government to achieve carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035 and net-zero emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050. The US Department of Energy (DOE) and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have jointly undertaken measures to address methane emissions.The mission of the DOE's Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) is to minimize the environmental and climate impacts of fossil fuels and industrial processes while working toward net-zero emissions. FECM collaborates closely with the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) whose mission is to drive innovation and deliver solutions for an environmentally sustainable and prosperous future. Collectively FECM and NETL have been at the forefront of carbon management research for the past three decades through programs that support research, development, demonstration, and deployment to advance technologies that reduce emissions and other environmental impacts of fossil fuels and industrial production. FECM and NETL leverage their well-established core competencies to lead comprehensive programs focused on carbon dioxide (CO2) management, including point source carbon capture, carbon dioxide removal, and carbon storage, abatement of methane emissions, including methane mitigation technologies, and natural gas decarbonization hydrogen technologies to accelerate the development of a carbon-free power sector by 2035 and a "net-zero" carbon economy by 2050.To meet a 1.5&#186;C scenario, it is imperative to implement a wide range of carbon management strategies encompassing both carbon capture and methane emissions abatement. In August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, which included a Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP), giving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to award grants for financial and technical assistance for activities including the reduction of methane and other GHG emissions from petroleum and natural gas systems and infrastructure. In late 2023, the EPA partnered with NETL to provide technical support, along with program and project management expertise, to provide technical expertise and implement a program strategy to invest over $1 billion to measure and mitigate methane emissions. Currently, FECM and NETL are managing over $5 billion in Bipartisan and Infrastructure Law (BIL) and IRA funding directed toward Carbon Management and Resource Sustainability (oil &amp; gas).This paper will examine the progress and achievements of FECM and NETL in developing a carbon management solution that tackles both sources of carbon: carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). It covers an overview of the current program, lessons learned from the program and project execution, and the status of ongoing funding opportunity announcements.</description>

                Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into sustainable fuels and base chemicals requires precise control over and understanding of activity, selectivity and stability descriptors of the electrocatalyst under operation. Identification of the active phase under working conditions, but also deactivation factors after prolonged operation, are of the utmost importance to further improve electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 conversion. Here, we present a multiscale in situ investigation of activation and deactivation pathways of oxide-derived copper electrocatalysts under CO2 reduction conditions. Using well-defined Cu2O octahedra and cubes, in situ X-ray scattering experiments track morphological changes at small scattering angles and phase transformations at wide angles, with millisecond to second time resolution and ensemble-scale statistics. We find that undercoordinated active sites promote CO2 reduction products directly after Cu2O to Cu activation, whereas less active planar surface sites evolve over time. These multiscale insights highlight the dynamic and intimate relationship between electrocatalyst structure, surface-adsorbed molecules, and catalytic performance, and our in situ X-ray scattering methodology serves as an additional tool to elucidate the factors that govern electrocatalyst (de)stabilization. The development of robust materials for electrochemical CO2 conversion requires identification of the activation and deactivation phase after prolonged operation. Here, the authors present a multiscale in situ X-ray scattering methodology to probe the life and death of copper oxide electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Indoor Air Pollutant (PM 10, CO2) Reduction Using a Vortex Exhaust Ventilation System in a Mock-Up Room</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings15010144</link>
      <description>Yong-Woo Song, Seong&#8208;Eun Kim, Jin-Chul Park, Buildings. 15(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406085685

                In this study, a performance comparison experiment with a vortex exhaust installed at the end of a ventilation device to enhance the effect induced by reducing indoor pollutants was conducted. The experiment was carried out by constructing a mock-up room with a limited indoor environment, and performances were compared based on the following two tests. First, to confirm the effect of pollutant reduction, the wind speed was measured based on the distance from each exhaust system to verify the depth and speed at which wind can flow. Pollutants were induced to the vortex exhaust, general exhaust gasses were generated, and their performances were compared. Second, Arizona dust was used to confirm the performance with regard to the removal of pollutants which existed in particulate form (PM 10), and for CO2 gas, a representative gaseous pollutant was used as a reference. Based on the results, it was confirmed that installing a vortex exhaust system can allow for the generation of wind speeds that allow propagation at greater depths (&gt;110 mm) compared to cases in which general exhaust is used; accordingly, exhaust performance can be achieved at increased depths. In addition, the experiment confirmed that vortex exhaust can improve the efficiency of simultaneous removal of PM 10 and CO2 compared with general exhaust. Further, it was shown that installing a vortex exhaust system can remove PM 10 and CO2 farther from the exhaust port in a shorter period than a general exhaust port. In addition, it was inferred that vortex exhaust can be utilized to prevent indoor pollutants and diseases in combination with the latest technology.</description>

      <title>Achieving Zero Waste and CO2 Reduction in Saline Water Treatment&#8212;Sustainable Salt and Ice Recovery Using Pipe Freeze Crystallization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/min15010051</link>
      <description>Kagiso S. More, J. P. Maree, Minerals. 15(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406087328

                This study investigates the application of pipe freeze crystallization (PFC) as a sustainable, zero-waste technology for treating high-salinity industrial wastewater, enabling the simultaneous recovery of salts and clean water. PFC addresses the limitations of traditional brine treatment methods such as evaporation ponds and distillation, which are energy-intensive, produce concentrated brine requiring disposal, and emit significant CO2. A pilot demonstration plant in Olifantsfontein, South Africa, served as the basis for this research. The plant operates at an energy consumption rate of 330 kJ/kg, significantly lower than distillation&#8217;s 2200 kJ/kg. It efficiently recovers high-purity Na2SO4 and clean ice, which can be reused as water, with plans underway to incorporate NaCl recovery. Comparative analyses highlight PFC&#8217;s energy efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions, achieving an 82% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to evaporation-based methods. This study evaluates the operational parameters and scalability of PFC for broader industrial applications. X-ray Diffraction analysis confirmed that the Na2SO4 recovered from the pilot plant achieved a purity level of 84.9%, demonstrating the process&#8217;s capability to produce valuable, market-ready by-products. These findings reinforce PFC&#8217;s potential as a cost-effective and environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional methods. PFC offers a transformative solution for managing saline effluents, aligning with zero-waste objectives and contributing to reduced environmental impact. This technology provides industries with an economically viable solution for resource recovery while supporting compliance with stringent environmental regulations.</description>

      <title>Strategic Reduction Method for Energy Input and CO2 Emissions: Direct Supply of Underground Seawater for Land-Based Aquaculture Systems in South Korea</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en18010177</link>
      <description>Seungyeop Baek, BH Jeon, Sebong Oh, Wontak Choi, Seunggi Choi, Yonmo Sung, Energies. 18(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406049598

                This study addresses the challenges of and opportunities for achieving the ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of the fishery sector of the Republic of Korea, set at 96% by 2030. We also focus on the current status of land-based aquaculture and underground seawater resource development, quantitatively compare energy inputs for land-based fish cultivation, and evaluate the potential of underground seawater to reduce CO2 emissions. Since 2010, 762 underground seawater boreholes have been developed, yielding a cumulative daily pumpage of 125,780 m3. Jeollanam-do was found to have the highest daily pumpage, with an annual energy requirement of 131,205,613 Mcal. Despite the fact that the energy demands for underground seawater are higher in some months, it provides a 22.6% reduction in total annual energy consumption compared to surface water. The use of underground seawater for heating or cooling resulted in a 24.1% reduction in the required input energy. However, energy requirements increase due to the relatively high surface water temperature in some regions and seasons. This study also highlights the utilization of underground seawater in heating or cooling surface water via indirect applications using geothermal heat pumps. This innovative research broadens the methods of greenhouse gas mitigation, particularly in the agriculture, livestock, and fisheries industries.</description>

      <title>Removing Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Using Large Land Or Ocean Areas Will
  Change Earth Albedo And Force Climate</title>

                When large surface areas of the Earth are altered, radiative forcing due to changes in surface reflectance can drive climate change. Yet to achieve the necessary scale to remove the substantial amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere relevant for ameliorating climate change, enhanced rock weathering (ERW) will need to be applied to very large land areas. Likewise, marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) must alter a large fraction of the ocean surface waters to have a significant impact upon climate. We show that surface albedo modification (SAM) can easily overwhelm the reduction in radiative forcing from the decrease of atmospheric CO2 due to ERW or mCDR over timescales of decades. SAM via ERW can be either cooling or warming. We identify some of the many questions raised by radiative forcing due to these forms of CDR.</description>

      <title>Role of bulk viscosity on the flow physics past a rotating cylinder</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0245774</link>
      <description>Ankush, Bidesh Sengupta, Satyvir Singh, L. Prince Raj, Physics of Fluids. 37(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406085324

                The present study investigates the impact of bulk viscosity on the complex flow dynamics past a rotating cylinder, with particular emphasis on compressible and non-equilibrium effects that emerge in nitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2). By solving unsteady conservation laws obtained from the Boltzmann&#8211;Curtiss transport equation, the research focuses on key flow features such as vortex shedding, vorticity generation, enstrophy, kinetic energy dissipation, and the degree of thermal non-equilibrium. Numerical simulations are performed at a Mach number of 0.6 using the dbnsTurbFoam solver with unstructured meshes, and the computational model is verified using available data for flow past a rotating cylinder. The results reveal that bulk viscosity significantly affects vortex shedding, particularly suppressing vortex formation and reducing flow instability. In CO2, high bulk viscosity nearly eliminates vortex shedding, leading to a laminar wake, while in N2, vortex shedding is dampened but persists. Enstrophy and vorticity production through stretching and baroclinic effects are also reduced in both gases as bulk viscosity increases, with CO2 showing more dramatic reductions due to its higher inherent viscosity. The study further indicates that bulk viscosity enhances kinetic energy dissipation in both gases, with N2 exhibiting sharper dissipation than CO2. Additionally, the role of rotational speed is explored, showing that higher rotational speeds amplify vorticity production and energy dissipation. While high-speed rotation induces more turbulence and instability in N2, it stabilizes the flow in CO2, leading to a more organized wake. The findings demonstrate that bulk viscosity and rotational speed are crucial in controlling flow stability and energy dissipation, with significant variations depending on the gas properties.</description>

      <title>Performance-Based Ranking of Transient Data-Driven Dynamic Surrogate Models for Psa Process Towards Optimization and Control; Narx, Lstm, and Gru</title>

                This study focuses on the use of advanced neural network methods to predict the transient behavior of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) processes in the presence of disturbances in gas separation/purification units, specifically targeting the upgrading of biogas by separating methane (CH4) from carbon dioxide (CO2) utilizing carbon molecular sieve (CMS) as the adsorbent. The cyclic nature of PSA, with its sequence of adsorption, depressurization, blowdown, purging, pressure equalization and repressurization steps, necessitates robust modeling techniques to achieve high purity rates. This paper emphasizes the development and validation of surrogate models based on NARX, LSTM and GRU neural networks that can replicate the PSA process with high fidelity, thus offering significant reductions in computational time compared to traditional methods. The study's findings indicate that LSTM networks provide the best balance of accuracy and speed, making them a viable tool for real-time optimization and control of PSA systems. In other words, while the pseudo-real plant's runtime surpasses 20 sec per cycle, creating difficulties for real-time optimization and control applications, the LSTM-based surrogate model can accurately predict the desired outputs for 900 cycles in just 0.63 sec, with an outstanding error magnitude of 1e-6, which is less than 0.004 % of the full-order model.</description>

      <title>Emerging carbon dioxide hotspots in East Asia identified by a top-down inventory</title>

                A high-resolution carbon dioxide emission inventory is essential for accurate carbon emission assessment and management. This study used a top-down spatial proxy model to develop a high-resolution (1 km) carbon dioxide emission inventory for East Asia from 2012 to 2021. Combining multiple data sources with geographically weighted regressions can improve the accuracy of the spatial distribution of sectors within carbon dioxide inventories. To demonstrate accuracy, we compared our inventory with existing carbon dioxide inventories, such as the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China, which uses a 'bottom-up' approach. We outline and discuss the convergence and divergence in the estimation results of the different approaches, finding generally consistent results. Based on the high-resolution carbon dioxide grid, nationally, China accounted for over 80% of East Asia's carbon dioxide emissions, followed by Japan and South Korea. The results of the hotspot and driver analyses reveal persistent hotspots in Northern and Eastern China, as well as new trends in Northwestern China. The main drivers of emissions growth in hotspots are economic growth and changes in the energy mix. The drivers of emission changes in cold hotspot regions vary depending on regional characteristics. Actionable insights are provided for targeted regional carbon reduction strategies. Continued growth of carbon dioxide emissions occurred across Northern and Eastern China in the period 2012-2021, and a new growth hotspot emerged in Northwest China, according to a high-resolution top-down emissions inventory for East Asia.</description>

                Abstract In addition to steep carbon emission reductions, all modeled pathways to reach global climate goals require carbon removal. Marine carbon dioxide removal has the potential to play a large role in drawing down legacy anthropogenic emissions due to the scalability and durability of proposed methods. While this field is rapidly expanding, a number of issues remain, including efforts to grow the industry, align projects with equity and justice goals, and ensure development of trusted, unique, durable carbon credits. We, a group of early career ocean professionals (ECOPs), provide an overview of the scale of the field, the aforementioned issues, and then make recommendations to ensure global equity and expand early career capacity in the marine carbon dioxide removal sector. We argue that substantial investment is needed to reduce costs of marine carbon dioxide removal and spur innovation in monitoring, reporting, and verification, but also in the training and development of early career researchers. Careful co&#8208;design of marine removal projects by experienced and emerging collaborators, including local communities, can help mitigate perpetuating existing global inequalities. Given the anticipated growth of the marine carbon dioxide removal workforce, ECOPs can contribute their existing interdisciplinary expertise, if they are supported within traditional structures. Those entering the field can leverage skill sets that intersect engineering, policy, community engagement, and business. We maintain that ECOPs will be key leaders in the field, if appropriately engaged, compensated, and empowered.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Population Aging on Carbon Emissions: Based on the Perspective of Industrial Structure Upgrading and Rationalization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54254/2754-1169/2025.19684</link>
      <description>Xinran Li, Advances in Economics Management and Political Sciences. 159(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406035301

                China's aging population society has entered a high-speed deepening stage, promoting energy saving and emission reduction, realizing low carbon development history is an important strategic task in our country. On the Basis of panel data since 2011 to 2021, using an intermediate effect model, this paper studies the relations among the population aging, industry structure upgrading as well as rationalization and the emission of carbon dioxide. The results indicate that aging exerts a significant positive impact on carbon emissions. The influence of population aging on carbon emissions is inverted U shape. When aging reaches a certain level, the influence on carbon emissions has a nonlinear feature of decreasing marginal effect. The aging can exert a prominent influence on carbon emissions in the regions through upgrading and rationalization of the industrial structure. That influence about population aging on carbon emissions is remarkable in the region. Therefore, promoting the optimization process of industry structure forced by population aging contributes to realizing "reduction effect of carbon emissions" under the background of population aging.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Mapping of Energy Consumption Carbon Emission Spatiotemporal Characteristics: A Case Study of the Yangtze River Delta Region</title>

                Climate issues significantly impact people&#8217;s lives, prompting governments worldwide to implement energy-saving and emission-reducing measures. However, many areas lack carbon emission data at the lower administrative divisions. Additionally, the inconsistency in the standards, scope, and accuracy of carbon dioxide emission statistics across different regions makes mapping carbon dioxide spatial patterns complex. Nighttime light (NTL) data combined with land use data enable the detailed spatial and temporal disaggregation of carbon emission data at a finer administrative level, facilitating scientifically informed policy formulation by the government. Differentiating carbon emission data by sector will help us further identify the carbon emission efficiency in different sectors and help environmental regulators implement the most cost-effective emission-reduction strategy. This study uses integrated remote-sensing data to estimate carbon emissions from fossil fuels (CEFs). Experimental results indicate (1) that the regional CEF can be calculated by combining NTL and Landuse data and has a good fit; (2) the high-intensity CEF area is mainly concentrated in Shanghai and its surrounding areas, showing a concentric circle structure; (3) there are obvious differences in the spatial distribution characteristics of carbon emissions among different departments; (4) hot spot analysis reveals a three-tiered distribution in the Yangtze River Delta, increasing from the west to the east with distinct spatial characteristics.</description>

      <title>Optimization of carbon footprint management model of electric power enterprises based on artificial intelligence</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0316537</link>
      <description>Liangzheng Wu, K. Li, Yan Huang, Zhengdong Wan, Jieren Tan, PLoS ONE. 20(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406052380

                This study intends to optimize the carbon footprint management model of power enterprises through artificial intelligence (AI) technology to help the scientific formulation of carbon emission reduction strategies. Firstly, a carbon footprint calculation model based on big data and AI is established, and then machine learning algorithm is used to deeply mine the carbon emission data of power enterprises to identify the main influencing factors and emission reduction opportunities. Finally, the driver-state-response (DSR) model is used to evaluate the carbon audit of the power industry and comprehensively analyze the effect of carbon emission reduction. Taking China Electric Power Resources and Datang International Electric Power Company as examples, this study uses the comprehensive evaluation method of entropy weight- technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). China Electric Power Resources Company has outstanding performance in promoting renewable energy, with its comprehensive evaluation index rising from 0.5458 in 2020 to 0.627 in 2022, while the evaluation index of Datang International Electric Power Company fluctuated and dropped to 0.421 in 2021. The research conclusion reveals the actual achievements and existing problems of power enterprises in energy saving and emission reduction, and provides reliable carbon information for the government, enterprises, and the public. The main innovation of this study lies in: using artificial intelligence technology to build a carbon footprint calculation model, combining with the data of International Energy Agency Carbon Dioxide (IEA CO 2 ) emission database, and using machine learning algorithm to deeply mine the important factors in carbon emission data, thus putting forward a carbon audit evaluation system of power enterprises based on DSR model. This study not only fills the blank of carbon emission management methods in the power industry, but also provides a new perspective and basis for the government and enterprises to formulate carbon emission reduction strategies.</description>

                Climate change and global warming demand immediate action, and a global carbon trading system can help by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon credits allow companies to emit a defined amount of carbon dioxide, with each credit typically equaling one ton. Although these credits incentivize emissions reduction, current systems lack transparency, face high transaction costs, and benefit intermediaries. Our project proposes a blockchain-based Carbon Credit Ecosystem that uses blockchain and smart contracts to create a more transparent, accessible, and efficient carbon market. This system will tokenize carbon credits, establish protocols for credit creation and retirement, and transparently manage trading. Engaging stakeholders like the energy sector, project verifiers, NGOs, citizens, and governments, our model provides broad benefits and is adaptable to other credit and trading systems.

      <description>Bo Zhang, Mingyue Gong, Dong Chen, Molecular &amp; cellular biomechanics. 22(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4405981860

                The global consensus to move towards carbon neutrality has been growing amidst turbulence, and the issue of carbon emissions has been an unavoidable topic for achieving the goal of carbon neutrality. The introduction of microalgae photosynthetic carbon sequestration technology optimizes the culture environment of microalgae through hydrodynamics and enhances the efficiency of light and carbon dioxide transfer, thus increasing the rate of photosynthesis and carbon sequestration effect of microalgae. Based on the biomechanical perspective, this study constructed a three-party dynamic evolution game model including agricultural subjects, enterprises and local governments, analyzed the mechanism of photosynthetic carbon sequestration by microalgae, the financing subsidy system and the carbon trading mechanism, and explored the strategic choices and behavioral evolution process of the agricultural subjects and local enterprises in the face of different policy incentives, and verified the conclusions by numerical simulation analysis. The study shows that: (1) the implementation of financial subsidy policies by local governments significantly increases the willingness of agricultural producers and enterprises to apply microalgae photosynthetic carbon sequestration technology, thus accelerating the process of agricultural carbon emission reduction; (2) the integration of energy enterprises and microalgae industry in the carbon trading market is conducive to the generation of renewable energy, and realizes a win-win situation for the government&#8217;s environmental benefits and the enterprise&#8217;s economic benefits; (3) the adoption of microalgae carbon sequestration by agricultural producers (3) The adoption of microalgae carbon sequestration technology by agricultural producers is conducive to the promotion of the virtuous cycle of soil microbial communities and the realization of crop income. This study evaluates the potential impacts of different policy combinations on agricultural carbon emission reduction based on the carbon trading mechanism, which can help promote the application of microalgae carbon sequestration technology and the implementation of agricultural carbon emission reduction.</description>

      <title>Grid-level impacts of renewable energy on thermal generation:
  efficiency, emissions and flexibility</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2501.01954</link>
      <description>Dhruv Suri, Jacques A. de Chalendar, In&#234;s M.L. Azevedo, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406093561

                Wind and solar generation constitute an increasing share of electricity supply globally. We find that this leas to shifts in the operational dynamics of thermal power plants. Using fixed effects panel regression across seven major U.S. balancing authorities, we analyze the impact of renewable generation on coal, natural gas combined cycle plants, and natural gas combustion turbines. Wind generation consistently displaces thermal output, while effects from solar vary significantly by region, achieving substantial displacement in areas with high solar penetration such as the California Independent System Operator but limited impacts in coal reliant grids such as the Midcontinent Independent System Operator. Renewable energy sources effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions in regions with flexible thermal plants, achieving displacement effectiveness as high as one hundred and two percent in the California Independent System Operator and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. However, in coal heavy areas such as the Midcontinent Independent System Operator and the Pennsylvania New Jersey Maryland Interconnection, inefficiencies from ramping and cycling reduce carbon dioxide displacement to as low as seventeen percent and often lead to elevated nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions. These findings underscore the critical role of grid design, fuel mix, and operational flexibility in shaping the emissions benefits of renewables. Targeted interventions, including retrofitting high emitting plants and deploying energy storage, are essential to maximize emissions reductions and support the decarbonization of electricity systems.</description>

      <description>Xianan Jiao, Wu Jiekang, Yunshou Mao, Mengxuan Yan, Qingtao Rui, Zhikai Pang, Energy Science &amp; Engineering. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406083592

                ABSTRACT As urban areas expand, energy demands are escalating, necessitating the development of urban energy systems (UES) to achieve energy conservation and emission reduction goals. Although small&#8208;scale regional integrated energy supply technologies have reached a level of maturity, urban&#8208;scale integrated energy supply solutions are still in development. In response, this study introduces an architecture for the UES and an economic and low&#8208;carbon operation strategy. The approach begins by constructing a highly reliable and robust integrated energy system (IES) within each independent region to accommodate a variety of energy needs, followed by the establishment of an operational architecture for large&#8208;scale urban energy systems. The study then examines the energy flow and the mathematical model of multiple energies within urban energy systems, simplifying the complex model for practical application. Subsequently, a multiobjective optimization model is developed to facilitate the large&#8208;scale consumption of clean energy, with considerations for economic and low&#8208;carbon operations, and is formatted into a linear programming model. The model's accuracy is empirically tested through numerical simulation in a city divided into three regions. The simulation results demonstrate substantial improvements in clean energy consumption, a reduction in carbon emissions, and a decrease in operational costs. Specifically, the proposed strategy can boost the clean energy consumption rate to 96.41%, cut operational costs by up to 50.13%, and lower carbon dioxide emissions by up to 57.59% compared to traditional technologies. These findings robustly validate the methodology's effectiveness, paving the way for more sustainable urban energy management practices.</description>

      <title>The State of the Art of Residential Building Energy Retrofits in Libya and Neighbouring Mediterranean Countries: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en18010183</link>

                With the increasing concern about global warming and future climate change, attention has been drawn to the need to reduce building energy use through improving buildings&#8217; energy efficiency. Existing residential buildings constitute the largest percentage of energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions, and hence, offer significant potential for energy savings and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. This review aimed to provide an in-depth analysis of current research on improving the energy efficiency of existing residential buildings in Libya and neighbouring Mediterranean countries, with a focus on research methods and tools utilised in this domain. This helped to identify potential areas of intervention to improve the energy efficiency of existing residential stock in Libya. Under identified themes, this study systematically analysed 44 publications of high relevance to the subject area found in Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. The results reveal that while energy retrofitting is a research area of interest in the region considered, studies in the Libyan context are limited. There is also limited attention to achieving net zero energy and embodied carbon reductions, specifically in the Libyan context. Moreover, some weaknesses were identified for most of the studies reviewed, including those in the Libyan context, related to the credibility and reliability of the energy models used in the various literature.</description>

                Power-to-X (P2X) pathways represent alternative storage technologies for utilization of surplus electricity from renewable energy sources (RES) and for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction. These P2X pathways can be used to convert renewable surplus electricity and carbon dioxide from various sources into valuable products such as synthetic fuels and chemicals. Significant progress has been made in these processes towards replacement of conventional fossil fuel-based technologies in the recent years. In this paper the development of these novel technologies is reviewed, having a focus especially on the techno-economic analysis. Key performance indicators such as plant efficiency and production cost are discussed. Finally, knowledge gaps and future research outlook of P2X are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH Catalyzed by an Iron Porphyrinoid</title>

                Designing catalysts for the selective reduction of CO2, resulting in products having commercial value, is an important area of contemporary research. Several molecular catalysts have been reported to facilitate the reduction of CO2 (both electrochemical and photochemical) to yield 2e&#8211;/2H+ electron-reduced products, CO and HCOOH, and selective reduction of CO2 beyond 2e&#8211;/2H+ is rare. This is partly because the factors that control the selectivity of CO2 reduction beyond 2e&#8211; are not yet understood. An iron chlorin complex with a pendent amine functionality in its second sphere, known to selectively catalyze CO2RR to HCOOH with a very low overpotential from its formal Fe(I) state, can catalyze CO2RR from its formal Fe(0) state by 6e&#8211;/6H+, forming CH3OH as a major product with a Faradaic yield of &#8764;50%. Mechanistic investigations using in situ spectro-electrochemistry indicate that the reactivity of a low-spin d7 FeI&#8211;COOH intermediate species generated during CO2RR is crucial in determining the product selectivity of this reaction. In weakly acidic conditions, C-protonation of this FeI&#8211;COOH species, which is also chemically prepared and spectroscopically characterized, leads to HCOOH. The O-protonation, leading to C&#8211;OH bond cleavage and eventually to CH3OH, is &#8764;3 kcal/mol higher in energy and can be achieved in more acidic solutions. Hydrogen bonding to the pendent amine in the catalyst stabilizes reactive intermediates formed in the CO2RR and enables 6e&#8211;/6H+ reduction of CO2 to CH3OH.</description>

      <title>Simulation of direct dimethyl ether (DME) synthesis using existing methanol production infrastructure in Arzew, Algeria</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.18668/ng.2024.12.06</link>
      <description>Ilhem Sidi-Yacoub, Ahmed Feddag, Ikram Khelifa, Nafta-Gaz. 80(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406038649

                This study investigates the direct synthesis of dimethyl ether (DME) from syngas using the existing methanol production infrastructure at the Methanol and Synthetic Resins complex in Arzew, Algeria. The primary objective is to assess the feasibility of repurposing the adiabatic multiphase fixed-bed methanol production reactor for DME production while maintaining the original reactor dimensions, flow conditions, syngas composition, as well as temperature and pressure parameters used in methanol production. The research introduced a significant modification by replacing the initial copper oxide-based catalyst with a hybrid catalyst composed of &#947;-alumina and CuO/ZnO/Al2O3. This catalyst enables the direct production of DME from syngas, which is a mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen. The study employed simulation models using Aspen-HYSYS V11 to predict DME productivity, manage the high temperatures resulting from exothermic reactions in each catalyst bed, and determine the required quench gas injection for temperature reduction. The simulation results indicated an overall DME yield of 2.81%, which is comparable to the methanol production rate of 3%. Further simulations with recycling stages increased the crude DME mass to 4.11%. These findings highlight the potential of using the current infrastructure to improve profitability and time efficiency in producing this alternative fuel.</description>

                Abstract Solar&#8208;driven carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) provides an opportunity to produce value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks and fuels. However, achieving efficient and stable photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO 2 RR into selective products is challenging owing to the difficulties associated with the optical and the electrical configuration of PEC devices and electrocatalyst properties. Herein, we construct an efficient, concentrated sunlight&#8208;driven CO 2 RR setup consisting of InGaP/GaAs/Ge triple&#8208;junction cell as a photoanode and oxide&#8208;derived Au (Ox&#8208;Au) as a cathode to perform the unassisted PEC CO 2 RR. Under one&#8208;sun illumination, a maximum operating current density of 11.5 mA cm &#8211;2 with an impressive Faradaic efficiency (FE) of ~98% is achieved for carbon monoxide (CO) production, leading to a solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel conversion efficiency of ~15%. Under concentrated intensity of 10 sun, the photoanode records a maximum current density of ~124 mA cm &#8211;2 and maintains ~60% of FE for CO production. The results demonstrate crucial advancements in using III&#8211;V based photoanodes for concentrated PEC CO 2 RR.</description>

      <title>Country-Specific Modeling of Methane Production and Emission Reduction Utilizing Pig Manure</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en18010095</link>
      <description>Ilho Bae, Seokbo Park, Juhee Shin, Jin Mi Triolo, Seung Gu Shin, Energies. 18(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406018687

                The purpose of this study is to effectively support the operation of biogas plants that utilize anaerobic digestion of pig manure. An analysis was conducted on the characteristics of manure collected from 17 pig farms. Following this, the methane potential of the manure was evaluated, and a comparison of microbial communities was made at the end of the biochemical methane potential test. Based on these analyses, methane production during anaerobic digestion was modeled under various scenarios, allowing for the calculation of expected electricity generation and carbon dioxide reduction. The experimental results were categorized according to manure management type and the types of pigs raised. In this study, at a temperature of 37 &#176;C and a hydraulic retention time of 30 days, the scraper method demonstrated the highest methane production rates, achieving 0.85 and 1.03 m3/m3/day for both mono-anaerobic digestion of manure and co-digestion with food wastewater. However, establishing definitive characteristics of manure management types requires the collection of more comprehensive data from a broader range of farms, which will be critical for conducting further in-depth research.</description>

                Compounds featuring bonds between mercury and transition metals are of interest for their intriguing/ambiguous bonding and scarcely explored reactivities. We report herein the synthesis and reactivities of the new compound [(POCOP)Ni]2Hg, [Ni2Hg], featuring a trinuclear Ni&#8211;Hg&#8211;Ni core (POCOP = &#954;P,&#954;C,&#954;P&#180;&#8208;2,6&#8208;(i&#8208;Pr2PO)2C6H3). [Ni2Hg] reacts with CO2 to give the carbonate&#8208;bridged complex [Ni2CO3]. Bubbling CO gas through a solution of [Ni2CO3] gave its &#956;&#8722;CO2 analogue [Ni2CO2], which itself reacts with CO2 to give back [Ni2CO3], indicating that these two compounds interconvert reversibly. This implies that the formation of [Ni2CO3] from [Ni2Hg] and CO2 constitutes a reductive disproportionation of two molecules of CO2 into CO32&#8208; and CO. Tests showed that this process proceeds through three steps, an initial CO2 insertion to give [Ni2CO2], followed by another CO2 insertion to give the second intermediate [Ni2C2O4], and the latter&#8217;s decarbonylation to give [Ni2CO3]. Although the putative second intermediate could not be isolated, we have shown that it likely features a &#956;&#8722;carbonyl&#8208;carbonate rather than a &#956;&#8722;oxalate moiety, because the latter complex is thermally stable to decarbonylation. Reduction of [Ni2CO3] with excess Na/Hg regenerates [Ni2Hg], establishing that the observed deoxygenation of CO2 in this system can, in principle, be catalytic in the presence of excess reductant.</description>

                The capture and utilization of CO2 are critical for protecting the environment and ensuring the sustainable development of society. Given the challenges in separating multiple C1 products with similar reduction potentials, achieving high selectivity for a single reduction product while maintaining high conversion efficiency is essential. In this study, a photocatalyst with NH2-MIL-125-Ti/Cu dual-metal active sites was developed by introducing Cu2+ in situ. The synergistic interaction between oxygen vacancies that capture CO2 and the Cu-Ti dual active sites formed by Cu-C-O-Ti intermediates preferentially facilitated the generation of CO. As a result, high CO selectivity was achieved during the CO2 photoreduction process. The experimental results indicate that NM-Cu5 achieves nearly 100% selectivity for CO under visible-light irradiation, with a CO2-to-CO conversion rate of 598.22 &#956;mol g-1 h-1, representing a 108.28% improvement compared to NM. This study provides a novel strategy for designing and synthesizing more efficient and selective photocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Current Status of Methane Emissions in China and Its Impact on Climate Change: Policy and Countermeasure Analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54254/2754-1169/2025.19636</link>
      <description>Shuo Li, Advances in Economics Management and Political Sciences. 133(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406035969

                Sources of methane emissions include agriculture, such as rice fields and livestock farming, energy production, such as natural gas and oil extraction, and waste disposal, such as landfills. As a potent greenhouse gas, methane has a more substantial short-term warming effect than carbon dioxide, so controlling methane emissions has become an essential goal of global climate action. Countries are reducing methane emissions through policies, regulations, and technical means. Research has found that methane emissions have significantly impacted China's climate system, leading to frequent extreme weather events and posing threats to ecosystems. The Chinese government has adopted emission reduction policies but faces challenges in policy implementation and technology application. This article uses a literature review to analyze the current status of methane emissions in China, analyze its impact on climate change, evaluate the effectiveness of current policies, and propose improvements. The technological obstacles to reducing methane emissions and the challenges in implementing policies are examined in this essay, which combines policy analysis with technical application discussions. This provides a new perspective for climate policy research, enriches the research content in greenhouse gas emission reduction, and offers solid theoretical support for the comprehensive governance framework for climate change response.</description>

                This study analyzed the effectiveness of CO2 storage in basalt by simulating carbon mineralization during the injection of a CO2 solution into basalt cores. Porosity changes were assessed by modeling carbonate precipitation and basalt dissolution based on geochemical reactions. The correlation between the porosity and permeability was examined using the power-law equation to calculate the change in pressure during injection. The simulation results were validated by comparing the experimental data acquired from the Cheorwon region with respect to carbonate precipitation, porosity, permeability, and pressure difference. A sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the effects of CO2 solution type and mineral composition on carbon mineralization using basalt samples from Cheorwon and Jeju as well as sandstone sample. The modeling and simulation methods used in this study can be applied to analyze the carbon reduction and mineralization trapping of the CO2 stored in basalt formations.</description>

      <title>Exploring pyrolysis and reduction behaviour of high-sulphur petroleum coke for disposal of Zn-containing dust</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/03019233241307376</link>
      <description>Haiming Cheng, Weitong Du, Yao Tingfeng, Pu Guangqiang, Ju Dianchun, Zhuo Chen, Ironmaking &amp; Steelmaking Processes Products and Applications. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406042534

                High-sulphur petroleum coke (HSPC), a significant byproduct of petroleum refining, has limited applications except as fuel for combustion. This study aims to expand its utility by investigating its efficacy as a reductant for disposing of Zn-containing dust, thereby substituting traditional coal-based reductants. The pyrolysis results showed that the gases generated from the pyrolysis of HSPC primarily comprised hydrogen gas (H 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), methane and carbon dioxide. The reductant gases H 2 and CO accounted for above 90% of the total pyrolysis gas at 1200 &#176;C. The reduction reaction mechanism was elucidated by thermodynamic calculations and carbothermal experiments. At 800 &#176;C, ZnFe 2 O 4 is gradually decomposed into Fe 3 O 4 , FeO and ZnO, and Fe 2 O 3 is completely reduced to Fe 3 O 4 . At 900&#8211;1000 &#176;C, iron oxides are basically reduced to Fe, and ZnO is also reduced to Zn. Above 1100 &#176;C, CaMgSiO 4 as a slag phase is generated due to the combination of CaO, MgO and SiO 2 . At 1200 &#176;C, the roasting product with a metallic material is obtained, and the sulphur removal rate reaches 58%. This study provides valuable insights into the clean and efficient recovery and reuse of petroleum coke&#8211;coal, offering a promising avenue for sustainable resource management.</description>

                Understanding how TiO2 interacts with CO2 at the molecular level is crucial in the CO2 reduction toward value-added energy sources. Here, we report in-situ observations of the CO2 activation process on the reduced TiO2(110) surface at room temperature using ambient pressure scanning tunneling microscopy. We found that oxygen vacancies (Vo) diffuse dynamically along the bridging oxygen (Obr) rows of the TiO2(110) surface under ambient CO2(g) environments. This physical phenomenon exclusively occurs when the oxygen abstracted upon CO2 dissociation instantly occupies the Vo sites of Obr rows on the TiO2(110), whereas the TiO2(110) surface without the Vo only allows CO2 physisorption on five-fold-coordinated Ti4+ sites. Synchrotron-based ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy also identifies the changes in surface oxidation states of TiO2(110) by the healing of Vo sites or the CO2 physisorption under ambient CO2(g) conditions. Density functional theory calculations propose a mechanism of the CO2-driven Vo diffusion and the physisorbed CO2 configurations. Our combined results unravel the critical role of defect sites on TiO2 in determining the elementary step of CO2 activation during chemical reactions.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.7764/ric.00134.21</link>
      <description>Igor De la Varga, Yogiraj Sargam, Daniel Martins Alexio, Revista Ingenier&#237;a de Construcci&#243;n. 39(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406018863

                As the concrete industry continues to grapple with the challenge of reducing its carbon footprint, CO2 mineralization technologies offer a practical and scalable solution. These technologies enable the integration of CO2 as a valuable raw material, transforming waste emissions into durable mineral compounds during the concrete production process. This study investigates the implementation of CO2 mineralization in fresh concrete, analyzing its effects on key material properties such as strength and durability. Experimental results reveal that the process not only ensures equivalent compressive strength of concrete with a reduced cement content, but also contributes to reductions in embodied carbon compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, the study underscores the role of this approach in supporting the industry's decarbonization efforts, aligning with global sustainability goals. The findings highlight CO2 mineralization as a pivotal step toward the creation of more sustainable construction materials, offering both environmental and economic benefits. These conclusions demonstrate the transformative potential of this technology in advancing the sustainability of concrete production while addressing the pressing demand for eco-friendly construction practices.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Carbon Dioxide Separation via Desublimation from Shipboard Turbines with Exhaust Gas Recirculation using Direct Exhaust Gas Compression and Expansion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5066349</link>

                This study presents a refrigeration-based carbon capture system designed for shipboard integration, employing a modified reverse Brayton cycle to capture CO2 from turbine exhaust via desublimation. The system achieves CO2 capture by drying, compressing, cooling, and expanding exhaust gases to reach the temperatures required for CO2 desublimation, enabling efficient capture and storage of CO2 without complex chemical processes. The desublimation chamber, a central component, captures CO2 by phase change, allowing for streamlined storage and minimal energy footprint. A parametric analysis was conducted to assess the idealized performance of system components under varying exhaust gas compositions, compression ratios, and CO2 capture rates. Results indicate that desublimation temperature and cooling load requirements are strongly influenced by the initial exhaust gas CO2 concentrations, capture rates, and exhaust gas pressures. High capture rates require increased cooling loads and lowered desublimation temperatures, impacting overall system efficiency. Furthermore, the study introduces a comprehensive performance parameter that considers the balance between CO2 capture efficiency and energy demand, revealing an optimal threshold beyond which increased capture rates incur disproportionate energy penalties. This system meets the Navy's requirements for operational efficiency, waste heat recovery, and emissions reduction, offering a promising approach to sustainable shipboard operations.</description>

                Renewable energy&#8208;driven electrochemical CO2 reduction has emerged as a promising technology for a sustainable future. However, achieving efficient production of storable liquid fuels at ampere&#8208;level current densities remains a significant hurdle in the large&#8208;scale implementation of CO2 electroreduction. Here we report a novel catalytic electrode comprising chlorine&#8208;doped SnO2 nanoflowers arrayed on the exterior of three&#8208;dimensional nickel hollow fibers. This electrode demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic performance for converting CO2 to formate, achieving a remarkable formate selectivity of 99% and a CO2 single&#8208;pass conversion rate of 93% at 2 A cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent stability, maintaining a formate selectivity of above 94% for 520 h at a current density of 3 A cm&#8208;2. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations confirm that the enhanced mass transfer facilitated by the hollow fiber penetration effect, coupled with the well&#8208;retained Sn4+ species and Sn&#8208;Cl bonds, synergistically elevates the activity of CO2 conversion. The incorporation of chlorine into SnO2 enhances electron transport and CO2 adsorption, substantially lowering the reaction energy barrier for the crucial intermediate *OCHO formation, and boosting the formate production.</description>

      <title>The impacts of reduced ice sheets, vegetation, and elevated CO &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on future Arctic climates</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1080/15230430.2024.2433860</link>
      <description>Katherine Power, Qiong Zhang, Arctic Antarctic and Alpine Research. 56(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406027986

                This study investigates the climatic response of the Arctic to key factors that could shape future climate scenarios: significantly reduced ice sheets, changes in vegetation, and elevated CO2 levels. Using the EC-Earth3.3 Earth system model (ESM), we explore the effects of these forcings under conditions reminiscent of the mid-Pliocene, a key reference for potential future warm climates. Our results reveal that the Arctic climate response varies significantly with different CO2 levels, primarily due to feedbacks involving sea ice and surface albedo. The effects of the reduced ice sheet are, in a pre-industrial CO2 environment (280 ppm), an Arctic warming of 2.4&#176;C. This is driven by substantial sea ice loss in the Barents Sea, which reduces surface albedo. Surprisingly, at 400 ppm CO2, Arctic warming incurred from the ice sheet reduction is lower than expected, at 1.9&#176;C, because sea ice loss is less pronounced compared to pre-industrial conditions, leading to smaller albedo changes. At 560 ppm, the warming is more substantial (2.9&#176;C) but still less than expected, largely due to the already reduced sea-ice extent at this high CO2 level. Vegetation changes further modulate Arctic climate dynamics. At 400 ppm CO2, the expansion of needleleaf evergreen trees decreases surface albedo, adding an additional 0.5&#176;C of warming. However, at 560 ppm CO2, the warming effect of vegetation growth was muted (0.3&#176;C) due to the development of a more diverse canopy with brighter deciduous species, which mitigates the albedo-driven warming. Our findings underscore the complex interplay between CO2 levels, sea ice, and vegetation in determining in Arctic climate dynamics. They highlight that the importance of maintaining CO2 levels at or below 400 ppm to moderate Arctic warming effectively. This study emphasizes the value of integrating paleoclimate insights into future climate projections and underscores the need for a more detailed examination of feedback mechanisms to enhance the robustness of climate models.</description>

      <title>Using a Microsimulation Traffic Model and the Vehicle-Specific Power Method to Assess Turbo-Roundabouts as Environmentally Sustainable Road Design Solutions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/futuretransp5010004</link>

                The European Union&#8217;s path towards zero carbon dioxide emissions for new passenger vehicles necessitates a transitional period in which conventional vehicles coexist with zero-emission alternatives. This shift requires targeted strategies from engineers and policymakers, particularly in the area of road design, to reduce pollution. This study aims to investigate the environmental benefits of converting a two-lane urban roundabout into a turbo-roundabout through a virtual microsimulation approach using PTV VISSIM. The simulated model was calibrated and validated with real-world daily traffic data by properly adjusting the driving behavior parameters and comparing observed and modeled traffic volumes and queues. The Vehicle-Specific Power (VSP) emission method was applied to model, calculate and illustrate emissions by analyzing vehicle trajectories for the examined scenarios. Results show a statistically significant reduction in emissions for nearly all trips, with emissions decreasing by up to 44% across the intersection and its surrounding areas, and up to 23% at the intersection itself. Emissions are largely influenced by trip duration and traffic efficiency, both of which are enhanced by the improved geometric configuration of the case study intersection. These findings highlight that turbo-roundabouts represent an effective, environmentally sustainable design solution for urban intersections.</description>

      <title>Catalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Long Chain Esters via Formate Hydroesterification</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202403505</link>
      <description>Kyler B. Virtue, Babak Fayyaz, Francisco L&#243;pez-Linares, O. A. Mironov, C&#233;sar Ovalles, Wesley H. Bernskoetter, Chemistry - A European Journal. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406098027

                CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification is an attractive route to produce value added ester compounds, which could replace CO&#8208;based hydroesterification processes if sufficient catalytic technologies are developed. One path to CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification is through an organoformate intermediate, which is then used in olefin hydroesterification to generate the desirable esters. This route creates a net CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification process using tandem catalytic systems for CO2 hydrogenation to organoformate paired with formate&#8208;olefin hydroesterification. The tandem use of tripodal phosphine ruthenium(II) and 1,2&#8208;bis(di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphosphinomethyl)benzene palladium catalysts were found to successfully produce methyl nonanoate from CO2, H2, methanol and 1&#8208;octene in a single&#8208;stage batch process. The CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification catalysis efficiency was found to be largely limited by the productivity of organoformate generation and competitive 1&#8208;octene reduction. Catalytic yields of methyl nonanoate can be enhanced by adjustments in reaction procedures, including the use of a two&#8208;stage batch reaction process or delayed introduction of 1&#8208;octene, achieving a yield of up to 32%. Under select conditions, control experiments indicate yields of methyl nonanoate can be improved to ca 75%. Preliminary studies indicate significant interplay between the two ligands employed in the molecular tandem catalytic systems and establish the first catalytic protocol for the selective CO2&#8208;based hydroesterification of olefins via organoformates.</description>

                The materials constituting the pavement bodies, until today, have been limited to certain so-called noble materials (rolled sands, aggregates, etc.), but these are in the process of being exhausted under the effect of intensive exploitation and the scarcity of quality quarries. With the objective of preserving the deposits of aggregates in the process of exhaustion for future generations and of exploiting the aeolian sands in abundance in the regions of southern Algeria, we aim to enhance the latter in the body of the roadway mixed with the tuffs, this would imply a reduction in construction costs (use of local aggregates of lower quality available in large quantities, reduction in transport costs). From an environmental point of view, this would limit the impacts with a reduction in CO2 emissions linked to transport.</description>

      <title>Editorial: Dynamics of land use and carbon emissions in the context of carbon neutrality and carbon peaking</title>

      <description>Zhiheng Yang, Chenxi Li, Frontiers in Environmental Science. 12(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406083698

                Land Use Trade-offs under the 1.5&#176;C Temperature Control Target: van and Haigh (2024) explored the land use competition situation under the 1.5&#176;C climate stabilization scenario, proposed to jointly formulate strong policies and regulations to comprehensively promote the efficient use of land in fields such as food, energy, and nature conservation (doi: 10.3389/fenvs.2024.1379046).Precise Deconstruction of Natural Land Carbon Sinks: Qu et al. (2023) took the dominant position of forests in the absorption of carbon dioxide on land as the core basis, skillfully integrated the MIT carbon cycle model simulation with the Shell Energy Security Scenarios emission pathways, and constructed a precise analysis framework for national net-zero emission targets under different scenarios (https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2023.1289531). In addition, there are also some new trends, such as digital empowerment to improve the emission reduction efficiency of resource-based cities: Qian &amp; Luo (2024) found that digital transformation can significantly improve the land green use efficiency of resource-based cities through multiple paths such as driving technological innovation, promoting industrial structure upgrading, and alleviating the problem of land factor mismatch. (doi: 10.3389/fenvs.2024.1339928).Land systems possess both carbon sequestration and emission functions, and transitioning to carbon neutrality requires maintaining a delicate balance between these two roles. By making conscious and sustainable choices in land use, we can make significant progress in addressing climate change and creating a more resilient and low-carbon future for future generations.Protecting Natural Ecosystems: Improve the carbon storage capacity by protecting natural ecosystems such as forests, grasslands, farmlands and wetlands. This includes delimiting and managing ecological protection red lines and nature reserves to make effective use of the carbon sequestration capacity of natural ecosystems.Optimizing human activities space.: With the goal of low carbon emissions, the rational distribution of population and industries should be guided. By optimizing the quantitative structure and spatial pattern of land use, it will be beneficial to adjust the industrial layout, reduce the land use types mainly relying on fossil energy consumption, and improve energy utilization efficiency.Strengthening Land Use Regulation: Strictly control the expansion of construction land and deforestation to reduce carbon emissions from land use. It is crucial to monitor the carbon emissions and carbon emission intensity of major land use types and strengthen policy interventions in the process of carbon emissions from land use.Innovating Land Management Measures: Economic and policy incentives can be used to guide farmers to cultivate high-carbon sequestration crops, thereby increasing the carbon storage of farmland and grasslands.In general, this series of colorful, diverse, and in-depth studies in this issue reveals the complex relationships among land use, carbon emissions, and sustainable development. The various research results echo and closely connect with each other, just like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, jointly piecing together a magnificent blueprint for sustainable development. Achieving carbon neutrality and reaching peak emissions is a complex and long-term endeavor, with the dynamics of land use and carbon emissions being integral components of its success. Through measures such as scientific planning, rational layout, technological innovation, and policy guidance, we can promote a virtuous cycle between economic and social development and ecological environmental protection, contributing to the harmonious coexistence between humanity and nature.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Spatial Allocation of Pediatric Medical Facilities for Reduced Travel-Related CO2 Emissions: A Case Study in Tianjin, China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/land14010071</link>
      <description>Haohao Dong, Haifeng Zhang, Rui Wang, Yutong Zhang, Yuxue Zhang, Lisha Zhang, Land. 14(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4405989268

                Due to the limited availability of medical facilities and the urgency and irreplaceability of medical-seeking behaviors, the transportation processes used to access these resources inherently result in high carbon emissions. Unfortunately, pediatric medical facilities are among the least substitutable destinations, making it challenging to reduce travel-related CO2 emissions by traditional means such as decreasing travel frequency or optimizing transportation means. This study proposes enhancing the spatial allocation of pediatric medical facilities to effectively reduce travel-related CO2 emissions. This study selects 27 hospitals with pediatric departments in Tianjin as the research subject. It introduces a model for measuring travel-related CO2 emissions for pediatric medical-seeking, STIRPAT, and ridge regression models as well as conducts simulations under various scenarios to test the hypotheses. Therefore, methods for enhancing the spatial allocation of pediatric medical facilities are proposed. The results show that (1) travel-related CO2 emissions for pediatric medical-seeking are the highest in the city center, outpatient-related CO2 emissions surpass inpatient ones, and children&#8217;s hospital-related CO2 emissions are higher than those related to comprehensive hospitals, from which potential carbon reduction points can be explored; (2) children&#8217;s hospitals with multibranch and composite functional allocations can significantly reduce CO2 emissions; (3) comprehensive hospitals can further alleviate CO2 emissions from children&#8217;s hospitals by enhancing the medical level, transportation infrastructure, population distribution, and other spatial environmental factors; (4) from the perspective of low-carbon travel and equity, a spatial allocation strategy should be adopted for children&#8217;s hospitals that includes multiple branches and composite functions, while comprehensive hospitals should focus on service capacity, parity, supply&#8211;demand ratio, and the population density of children.</description>

                This study examines corn stalk biochar (CSB)-enhanced mortar as an innovative material for carbon capture and CO2 sequestration. CSB, a renewable agricultural byproduct, was incorporated into cement mortar at varying concentrations (2.5% to 75%), and its effects on the mortar&#8217;s physicochemical properties, its ability to support algal growth, and the CO2 absorption capacity of the algae were analyzed. Characterization of CSB showed a high carbon content (62.3%), significant porosity, and a large surface area (680.3 m2 g&#8722;1), making it ideal for gas capture. At low concentrations (2.5%), CSB slightly improved the mortar&#8217;s compressive strength and density. However, higher CSB levels (5% to 75%) led to significant reductions (p &lt; 0.05) in strength and density, while water absorption increased. CO2 sequestration monitored from algal growth studies revealed that both Chlorella sp. (TISTR 8262) and Scenedesmus sp. (TISTR 9384) thrived on CSB-enhanced mortars. At a 75% CSB concentration, Scenedesmus sp. achieved a 24.2-fold increase in biomass by day 12, outperforming Chlorella sp., which showed a 26.6-fold increase. CO2 absorption also improved with biochar. Mortars with 75% CSB achieved an 86% CO2 absorption ratio without algae, while adding algae boosted this to nearly 100%, highlighting the synergistic effect of biochar and algal photosynthesis. Higher CSB levels accelerated CO2 absorption stabilization, reaching saturation by day 8 at 75% CSB. Scenedesmus sp. showed slightly higher CO2 absorption efficiency than Chlorella sp., reaching peak absorption earlier and maintaining greater efficiency. Higher CSB concentrations accelerated CO2 absorption, indicating that biochar&#8211;mortar mixtures, particularly when combined with algae, provide a promising solution for enhancing carbon capture and sequestration in green infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Preparing for an extensive &#8710;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; flask sample monitoring campaign over Europe to constrain fossil CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions</title>

                Abstract. During 2024, an intensive &#916;14CO2 flask sampling campaign is being conducted at 12 stations across Europe as part of the CO2MVS Research on Supplementary Observations (CORSO) project. These &#916;14CO2 samples, combined with CO2 atmospheric measurements, aim to improve fossil CO2 emission estimates across Europe through inverse modeling. In this study, we perform a series of Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) to assess the added value of this intensive campaign and explore different sampling strategies for optimizing fossil fuel emission estimates. The strategies focus on selecting samples for inversions based on their fossil CO2 and nuclear 14C composition. We evaluate three sampling approaches: (1) a base scenario using uniform sampling without specific selection criteria, comparing current methods with the addition of flask samples; (2) a strategy that selects samples with high fossil CO2 content; and (3) a combined approach that accounts for nuclear 14C contamination to reduce potential biases from nuclear facilities. Our results suggest that higher sampling density improves the accuracy of fossil CO2 estimates, especially during low-emission periods, such as summer. Increasing the number of samples reduces uncertainty, enhancing the robustness of inverse modeling outcomes. Selecting samples based on fossil CO2 contamination further refines the estimates, but the most significant uncertainty reduction occurs when nuclear contamination is also considered. This combined strategy effectively mitigates biases in regions with high nuclear activity, like France and the UK. These findings highlight the importance of increasing sampling frequency and strategically selecting samples to improve fossil fuel emission estimates across Europe.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic Analysis of Heat Integrated Stripper Application in Chemical Absorption Process for Co2 Capture: Insights from Pilot Plant Studies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5079077</link>
      <description>Adam Tatarczuk, Marcin Szega, Tomasz Billig, L. Wi&#281;c&#322;aw&#8208;Solny, Janusz Zdeb, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4405972458

                This paper presents a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of heat-integrated stripper (HIS) application in chemical absorption processes for CO2 capture, drawing insights from pilot plant studies and simulation analyses. Escalating concerns over carbon emissions prompts a growing interest in amine-based chemical absorption, a proven and promising technology not only for the power industry but also for sectors with hard-to-abate emissions, such as cement, metallurgy, refining, and fertilizer production. Additionally, it supports the capture of CO2 from biogenic carbon sources (BECCS).The HIS, integrating heat exchangers within the stripper offers a potential solution to alleviate energy demands. Pilot tests at TAURON Power Plants, using a mobile plant with a 1 TPD CO2 capture capacity, validated a 7% reduction in reboiler heat duty with HIS. Simulation analyses corroborated experimental findings, providing insights into gas-liquid phase behavior and desorption efficiency across the stripper.The economic evaluation revealed a 1.3% increase in initial capital costs, offset by 3.2% operational savings, suggesting a payback period of less than two years. By enhancing CO2 capture efficiency and reducing energy demand, HIS integration offers a practical pathway toward improving the sustainability and economic viability of carbon capture technologies, supporting the global transition to a net-zero energy future.</description>

      <title>PROSPECTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROGEN ENERGY: INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES AS THE KEY TO REDUCING THE PRICE OF &#8220;GREEN&#8221; HYDROGEN</title>

                The article considers the prospects for the development of hydrogen energy, in particular, the application of hydrogen production technology based on water splitting using the latest electrolysis technologies. Particular attention is paid to the innovative methodology proposed by the Israeli company H2Pro, which promises a significant reduction in the cost of "green" hydrogen by 2030 to the level of less than $1 per kilogram. This reduction in hydrogen prices by 60-80% will make it more competitive in the energy market, which can lead to widespread adoption of hydrogen technologies in various sectors of the economy. The technology developed by H2Pro uses the E-TAC (Electrochemical Thermally Activated Chemical Water Splitting) method, which consists of a two-step process for the production of hydrogen and oxygen. The first stage involves cold electrochemical splitting of water, which generates hydrogen and oxidizes the anode, while the second stage, thermally activated, regenerates the anode by releasing oxygen, without the need for additional electricity consumption. This technology makes it possible to reduce energy costs and increase the efficiency of the process, reaching an efficiency of 95%, which is a significant achievement in the field of hydrogen energy. The author of the article also draws attention to the importance of this achievement for the global transition to renewable energy sources. In particular, reducing the cost of hydrogen production with the help of such technologies can provide cheaper energy production than traditional energy carriers such as gasoline and diesel, and also become a key factor in the implementation of ambitious environmental initiatives aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In addition to technological innovation, the article also discusses the need for infrastructure development for the storage, transportation and use of hydrogen, which remains one of the main barriers to its large-scale use. However, thanks to the efforts of companies such as H2Pro, which are actively working on improving production processes and reducing costs, hydrogen energy has a great chance of becoming an integral part of the energy system of the future. Thus, the development of hydrogen energy technologies, such as E-TAC, is an important step on the way to ensuring a clean and sustainable energy supply, which will contribute to reducing the environmental impact and ensuring the sustainable development of the world economy in the face of global climate change.</description>

                This study aimed to determine the effects of elevated carbon dioxide (eCO 2 ) and temperature (eT) on the phytochemical and nutritional parameters of legumes. Field experiments were conducted using black gram ( Vigna mungo L.), green gram ( Vigna radiate L.), and pigeonpea ( Cajanus cajan L.) genotypes under the Free Air Temperature Elevation (FATE) facility, with three treatments (Ac, eT, and eCO 2 + eT) at ICAR-CRIDA, Hyderabad. The results revealed that the negative impact on both phytochemical and nutritional quality was greater under eT compared to eCO 2 + eT. Specifically, protein content decreased by 25.6% under eT + eCO 2 , while the ash content increased by 38.19%. Carbohydrate levels also decreased by 5.53% under these conditions . The reduction in micronutrients (Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu) was more pronounced than in macronutrients (P, Ca, and Mg) across the three crops. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the major contributors to PC1 were Mg, crude fiber, cooking time, phosphorus, hydration capacity, ash content, and Mn. The primary contributors to PC2 included swelling capacity, Cu, Mn, carbohydrate, hydration capacity, and Zn. In contrast, the major contributors to PC3 were Ca, Fe, Zn, protein, carbohydrate, swelling index, and ash content. The eigenvalues of principal components, calibrated through different parameters, ranged from 1.052 to 4.755 in black gram and from 1.073 to 6.267 in green gram. This study provides insights into nutritional quality under changing global climate conditions.</description>

      <title>Statistical Correlations Between Various Drivers of Energy Demand in Post-Combustion Carbon Capture Retrofitted Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/chemengineering9010003</link>

                Power plants are one of the main sources emitting the CO2 that is responsible for climate change consequences. Post-combustion carbon capture (PCC), particularly using an aqueous solution, is highly recommended to be used as a mitigation solution to reduce the emissions of CO2 from power plants. Although PCC is a promising solution, the process still needs further development to reduce the energy demand for solvent regeneration. This paper reviews the challenges related to the post-combustion processes and finds the correlations between selected variables addressed by several researchers. Moreover, this study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the reduction in energy demand and efficiency penalties. The research findings highlight the importance of considering two key drivers during the design of the PCC process. These are the absorber temperature and the type and amount of the selected solvent. Indeed, statistical analyses show that there is a correlation between the identified drivers&#8217; values and the energy demand of solvent regeneration.</description>

      <title>Exploring the value of CO2 shipping transport flexibility in international batchwise transportation carbon capture and storage networks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5070419</link>
      <description>Denis Fraga, Anna Korre, Zhenggang Nie, &#350;evket Durucan, SSRN Electronic Journal. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406028171

                The benefits of CO&#8322; shipping transport within international Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) networks have been growing in importance as it offers flexibility and allows to postpone investment in capital-intensive infrastructure until enough CCS projects are launched. This work explores this value through a comparative cost assessment of 15 what-if scenarios devised for standalone and integrated CCS networks, designed around the Northern Lights project and the UK's Teesside cluster. The analysis is performed by implementing a Multi-period, Multi-mode, and Multi-objective Mixed integer linear programming (MoMilp) model developed at Imperial College London and considering all the elements of the CCS value chain after CO2 is captured (i.e. conditioning, intermediate storage and injection in the saline aquifer), allowing to account for individual regional characteristics in terms of design and network costs. The configurations of the different scenarios are used to analyse the implications of CCS network development hold up, e.g. for a part of the network to become available at a later period, or for the CO2 emission growth to occur at a later time in the planning horizon. The simulation results illustrate the interplay between postponing CCS network infrastructure investment and generating gains of scale in an existing network. This flexibility between CCS networks could provide relevant cost reduction while maximising the storage of CO2.</description>

      <title>Advancements in low carbon emission cements for 3D printing a state-of-the-art review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.7764/ric.00131.21</link>
      <description>Laura Silvestro, Rodrigo Scoczynski Ribeiro, Iv&#225;n Navarrete, Revista Ingenier&#237;a de Construcci&#243;n. 39(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406018913

                Concrete production, heavily reliant on Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC), is a significant contributor to global CO2 emissions, responsible for about 8% of human-related emissions. While past efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of cement focused on improving energy efficiency and incorporating supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), recent innovations have shifted towards low-carbon binders like calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement, limestone calcined clay (LC3) cement, and geopolymers. These alternatives offer considerable reductions in CO2 emissions during production. However, the adoption of these materials faces challenges, particularly in 3D-printed concrete (3DPC), an emerging construction method that demands specific rheological and mechanical properties. Research into these low-carbon binders shows that CSA cement provides rapid strength development, LC3 mixtures offer promising environmental benefits and structural integrity, and geopolymers achieve high compressive strength but require optimization for durability. This study summarizes a review of the effects of these binders on the fresh properties, mechanical performance, and durability of concrete, emphasizing their potential for use in 3DPC. The findings underscore the importance of optimizing material properties for enhanced performance and sustainability in the construction industry.</description>

      <title>Technology Adoption in the Power Sector: A Study of Recent Regulations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5078735</link>
      <description>J&#233;r&#244;me Detemple, Yerkin Kitapbayev, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4405979423

                This paper examines the effects of recent regulations (IRA) and proposals (EPA) pertaining to technology adoption in the power sector. We consider tax credits for carbon abatement, mandatory carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) equipment for gas plants and subsidies for carbon-free technologies. We quantify the impact on the optimal policies of a firm: the choice between carbon-intensive and Green technologies, the timing of investments, and the impact on CO2 emissions and welfare. Under the provisions of IRA, the likelihood of investing in wind generation increases, the likelihood of investing in CCS decreases, and emissions increase or decrease depending on prices. Implementing the EPA proposal instantaneously increases investment in CCS, but may result in increased emissions in the long run, depending on prices. Welfare improves under both regulations: negative effects on firm valuation and on society's cost of regulation are more than compensated by reductions in the social cost of carbon, even when low estimates of the social cost per ton of CO2 are used.</description>

      <title>Rational Design and Controlled Synthesis of MOF-Derived Single-Atom Catalysts</title>

                ConspectusSingle-atom catalysts (SACs) represent a transformative advancement in heterogeneous catalysis, offering unparalleled opportunities for maximizing atomic efficiency and enhancing performance. SACs are characterized by isolated metal atoms uniformly dispersed on suitable supports, ensuring each metal atom serves as an independent catalytic site. This dispersion mitigates metal atom aggregation, a common issue in conventional nanocatalysts, thus enabling superior activity, selectivity, and stability. Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as an ideal platform for SAC synthesis due to their structural diversity, tunable coordination environments, and high surface areas. MOFs provide well-defined coordination sites that facilitate the precise stabilization of single metal atoms, presenting significant advantages over traditional supports like metal oxides and metal materials. Carbonization of MOFs yields MOF-derived carbon materials that retain key structural characteristics while offering enhanced electrical conductivity and stability, making them suitable for various catalytic applications.Recent advances in the rational design and controlled synthesis of MOF-derived SACs have significantly improved their performance in electrocatalytic processes such as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, challenges remain, including maintaining structural integrity during high-temperature carbonization, enhancing mass and electron transport and ensuring the stability of isolated metal atoms under reaction conditions. To address these challenges, strategies such as using structure-directing agents to stabilize MOF frameworks, forming high-energy porous carbon networks, and optimizing support morphologies have been developed to maximize active site exposure and accessibility. On the other hand, the interplay between active metal sites and their coordination environments is crucial in determining the catalytic activity and selectivity of SACs. Advanced computational modeling, coupled with experimental validation, has provided insights into the electronic structure of SACs and the interactions between metal atoms and supports. These insights have enabled researchers to fine-tune local atomic coordination, leading to significant enhancements in performance. For instance, modifying the coordination environment of metal atoms optimizes the binding strength of reaction intermediates, thereby improving both activity and selectivity. This account highlights our group's contributions to MOF-derived SACs, focusing on innovative design, functionalization, and synthesis approaches that enhance catalytic activity. Notable strategies include using structure-directing agents to maintain pore connectivity during carbonization, preserving high surface areas, and enhancing mass transport. We also discuss the design of high-energy MOF-derived porous carbon networks that facilitate continuous electron transport and improve the interaction between active sites and reactants, ultimately boosting catalytic efficiency. Techniques such as electrospinning have also been employed to create hierarchical porous structures and one-dimensional nanofibers, enhancing mass transport and electron transfer. The rational design of SACs requires a comprehensive understanding of the microenvironment surrounding active sites, and by leveraging computational and experimental tools, researchers can precisely control these microenvironments to achieve desired outcomes.MOF-derived SACs hold substantial promise for energy conversion and chemical synthesis. Continued research is essential to optimize their design, improve scalability, and explore new applications, ultimately advancing sustainable catalysis. This account provides an overview of the latest advancements in MOF-derived SACs, highlighting their potential as next-generation electrocatalysts and their role in sustainable energy technologies.</description>

                High deuteration yields are difficult to attain with conventional chemical synthesis methods. In this work, we demonstrate that deuterated chemicals can be produced using electrochemical CO2 reduction in the presence of D2O. The absence of H2O enables deuteration yields over 99% for products such as ethanol-d6 and formate-d. With a D2O solvent, the competing D2 evolution reaction is completely suppressed at low current densities while being kept &lt;10% at a higher 300 mA/cm2.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms and Production Enhancement Effects of CO2/CH4 Mixed Gas Injection in Shale Oil</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en18010142</link>
      <description>Xiangyu Zhang, Qicheng Liu, Jieyun Tang, Xiangdong Cui, Shutian Zhang, Hong Zhang, Yinlong Lu, Xiaodong Dong, Hongxing Yan, Mingze Fu, Yuliang Su, Zheng Chen, Energies. 18(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4405995356

                Shale oil, a critical unconventional energy resource, has received substantial attention in recent years. However, systematic research on developing shale oil using mixed gases remains limited, and the effects of various gas compositions on crude oil and rock properties, along with their potential for enhanced oil recovery, are not yet fully understood. This study utilizes PVT analysis, SEM, and core flooding tests with various gas mixtures to elucidate the interaction mechanisms among crude oil, gas, and rock, as well as the recovery efficiency of different gas types. The results indicate that increasing the mole fraction of CH4 substantially raises the oil saturation pressure, up to 1.5 times its initial value. Pure CO2, by contrast, exhibits the lowest saturation pressure, rendering it suitable for long-term pressurization strategies. CO2 shows exceptional efficacy in reducing interfacial tension, though the viscosity reduction effects of different gases exhibit minimal variation. Furthermore, CO2 markedly modifies the pore structure of shale through dissolution, increasing porosity by 2% and enhancing permeability by 61.63%. In both matrix and fractured cores, the recovery rates achieved with mixed gases were 36.9% and 58.6%, respectively, demonstrating improved production compared to single-component gases. This research offers a theoretical foundation and novel insights into shale oil development.</description>

      <title>Electrifying Public Transport Networks in Dubai</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009471527.009</link>
      <description>Giovanna Potest&#224;, Mario Tartaglia, Cambridge University Press eBooks. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405970853

                This chapter explores the environmental benefits and social challenges for the city of Dubai's public transport network electrification plan. The Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in Dubai is currently experimenting with the possibility of powering public buses with electric energy. The shift from fossil fuels to electric power has been experienced in many European cities with evidence of benefits for both the environment and citizens. The enhancement of public transport and the use of 'CO2-free' energy has made people less dependent on cars, reducing the amount of air pollution and easing traffic congestion on the roads. Air quality also improved significantly with direct and indirect results on people's health and life quality. In the pledge for a reduction of CO2 emissions, the coverage of the entire territory of Dubai with an interconnected transport system, fuelled by electric power, is an achievement to pursue. The authors show evidence of this statement using data collected from a number of European experiences. To simulate the feasibility of a similar model in Dubai, the authors consider different contextual situations, such as climatic variation, urban forms, and social and cultural characteristics of users, enhancing the specificities of present technological research in alternative energy sources. Electrified and hydrogen-fuelled vehicles are analysed and their potential and limitations explained based on data and tests conducted in Europe.</description>

                Intermediate temperature (IT) solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) development is hindered by slow oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and poor CO2 tolerance at the cathode electrode. Here, we present a successful synthesis of a composite cathode material consisting of double perovskite structure Sr2CoNbO6&#8722;&#948; (SCNO) and fluorite structure Sm0.2Ce0.8O2&#8722;&#948; (SDC), using one-pot synthesis method. Integrating SDC to form a composite SCNO&#8211;SDC substantially augments the number of active sites, resulting in high ORR activity and lower polarization resistance. Forming a tight, coherent interface structure between SCNO and SDC particles is advantageous in reducing the thermal expansion coefficient and significantly improving the oxygen ion transport by creating a 3D pathway through the self-assembled growth of SDC particles. At 700 &#176;C, the SOFC (full cell) utilizing SCNO&#8211;SDC composite cathode exhibits a peak power density (PPD) of 0.786 W cm&#8211;2, surpassing the PPD of 0.602 W cm&#8211;2 attained by the SCNO alone. Furthermore, upon exposure to CO2, SCNO&#8211;SDC demonstrated remarkable performance recovery and tolerance. This study offers insights into the cathode material functioning of IT-SOFCs with enhanced electrochemical performance and long-term stability.</description>

      <title>Prospects of Attaining Thailand&#8217;s Carbon Neutrality Target Through Carbon Capture and Storage by Public Power Utility</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su17010276</link>
      <description>Waranya Thepsaskul, Wongkot Wongsapai, Tassawan Jaitiang, Panuwich Jaekhajad, Sustainability. 17(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4405993147

                Thailand has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, targeting the power generation sector, which contributes 35% of the country&#8217;s CO2 emissions, as a critical area for intervention. This study explores the transition toward carbon neutrality in power generation, focusing on fossil-fuel-based plants, particularly lignite and natural gas, which remain central to Thailand&#8217;s electricity production. A key strategy adopted by the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is &#8220;Sink Co-creation&#8221;, which includes the deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies in existing and future lignite power plants, leveraging favorable storage conditions. Additionally, natural gas power plants exhibit significant CCS potential through source&#8211;sink matching mechanisms. This study finds that the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions from fossil-fuel-based power plants could reach 17.07 MtCO2. Of this total, lignite power plants are projected to achieve a reduction of 3.79 MtCO2 by 2036, while natural gas power plants are expected to contribute an additional 13.28 MtCO2 in reductions by 2050. However, the realization of these reductions faces significant challenges, including the high costs associated with CCS implementation and limited investor interest, underscoring the critical need for sustained government support and policy incentives to facilitate progress toward carbon neutrality.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Optimization of Building Ventilation Systems Using Model Predictive Control: Integrating Air Quality, Energy Cost, and Environmental Impact</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app15010451</link>
      <description>Andreas Hyrup Andersen, Muhyiddine Jradi, Applied Sciences. 15(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406087574

                This paper presents a flexible heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) modeling framework developed for building digital twin implementation. The framework is showcased for the modeling and simulation of four ventilation systems in a 8500 m2 university building. The developed model includes multiple objective model predictive control (MPC) with three objectives: electricity cost, indoor air quality and CO2 emission attributed to electricity consumption. A control strategy comparison is conducted between several MPC solutions with different objective weightings and a rule-based control strategy, which emulates the current system control. A novel approach for air quality evaluation is proposed and used for the MPC modeling and strategy comparison in this study. In this comparison, a &#8220;balanced&#8221; MPC strategy reduces energy costs by 18% compared to rule-based control while also providing significantly better air quality. An economic strategy achieves 24% savings with some air quality reduction, while an air-quality-focused strategy provides nearly &#8220;perfect&#8221; air quality with 11% savings. Finally, an environmental strategy shows the potential for prioritizing CO2 emissions over electricity costs. In this way, the strategy comparison illustrates the potential of MPC for the efficient operation and flexible objective prioritization according to stakeholder interests.</description>

                Recent estimates put the carbon footprint of Bitcoin and Ethereum at an average of 64 and 26 million tonnes of CO2 per year, respectively. To address this growing problem, several possible approaches have been proposed in the literature: creating alternative blockchain consensus mechanisms, applying redundancy reduction techniques, utilizing renewable energy sources, and employing energy-efficient devices, etc. In this paper, we follow the second avenue and propose an efficient approach based on reinforcement learning that improves the block broadcasting scheme in blockchain networks. The analysis and experimental results confirmed that the proposed improvement of the block propagation scheme could cleverly handle network dynamics and achieve better results than the default approach. Additionally, our technical integration of the simulator and developed RL environment can be used as a complete solution for further study of new schemes and protocols that use RL or other ML techniques.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigations on Accelerated Solar Evaporation for Management of Concentrated Saline Liquor</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.34314/xad6dq57</link>
      <description>V. Veeravel, Gajendren Sathish, Nishanthi Rajendiran, S. V. Srinivasan, Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association. 120(01)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4405989500

                Solar energy is an important energy sector that plays a crucial role in reducing greenhouse emission in different industrial sectors, including the leather sector, to control the pollution. Stringent environmental regulations of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) in Indian tanneries are implemented as directed by regulatory authorities. The ZLD system resulted in the generation of saline rejected from membrane systems being evaporated by spending considerable energy. In this paper, the potential of solar energyfor evaporation of reject from ZLD in a closed accelerated solar dryer has been investigated. In this study, the evaporation of reject/ saline water using a solar dryer with different volumes has been experimented and the volume reduction and increase in Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are monitored during the drying period. It is evident that the closed accelerated solar dryer has shown an increase in evaporation rate with reduction in the volume of water in a given area. The outcome of this study would lead to avoidance of mechanical evaporators in case of smaller capacity ZLD plants and also reduce the amount of water to be evaporated in the Multiple Effect Evaporator (MEE) in case of larger ZLD plants. By the application of the accelerated solar dryer for the evaporator, the potential CO2 emission reduction due to replacement of different fuels used for evaporation of reject has been estimated to reduce the carbon footprint and to ensure the sustainability of the leather industry.</description>

      <title>The Applying Composts' Biochar for Gas Adsorption- Effect of Pyrolysis Conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5081115</link>
      <description>Sylwia Stegenta-D&#261;browska, Martin Galik, Magdalena Bednik, Ewa Sygu&#322;a, Katarzyna E. Kosiorowska, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406025910

                Not all compost produced meets established quality standards, which can lead to environmental challenges. This study explores the compost, as a feedstock for biochar production. Mature compost was utilized as a substrate, and the pyrolysis process involved heating samples within a temperature range of 400-650 &#176;C, at 50 &#176;C intervals, with heating rates of 10 &#176;C&#183;min&#8315;&#185;, 15 &#176;C&#183;min&#8315;&#185;, or 20 &#176;C&#183;min&#8315;&#185; for a duration of 60 minutes. The resultant biochars were exposed to a gas mixture analogous to composting gas (CO2, CO, H2S, NH3, CH4 in N2).Our findings reveal a significant correlation between pyrolysis temperature and the sorption characteristics of compost-derived biochars. Specifically, biochars produced at temperatures of 550 &#176;C, 600 &#176;C, and 650 &#176;C (with a heating rate of 10 &#176;C&#183;min&#8315;&#185;) demonstrated the highest efficacy in reducing emissions of CO2, CH4, and H2S, achieving reductions of 69%, 69%, and 72%, respectively. In contrast, the performance of these biochars for CO and NH3 adsorption was comparatively lower. Notably, biochars produced at 400 &#176;C and 450 &#176;C exhibited enhanced adsorption properties for CO emissions.This study underscores the substantial potential of compost-derived biochar for gas adsorption applications. However, due to its marked capacity for CH4 sorption, it is more likely to serve in mitigating emissions during composting rather than for biogas purification.</description>

                In this study, Cu&#8211;Co/In2O3 bimetallic catalysts were prepared by using a deposition precipitation method. The strong hydrogen dissociation ability of Cu decreased the reduction temperature of CoO to Co, thereby promoting the formation of the Cu&#8211;Co alloy. The interaction between Cu and Co led to electron transfer from Cu to Co, which effectively inhibited the formation of the harmful Cu&#8211;In alloy and facilitated the generation of oxygen vacancies in In2O3. The presence of abundant oxygen vacancies in Cu&#8211;Co/In2O3 increased CO2 adsorption and promoted the conversion of the methanol intermediate HCOO* to CH3O*. The Cu&#8211;Co/In2O3 catalyst exhibited 10.2% conversion and 72% methanol selectivity at 300 &#176;C and 5 MPa, which was higher than those of the monometallic catalyst Cu/In2O3 and Co/In2O3.</description>

                The recovery of natural resources has become a major challenge; in recent years, many economic players have focused on reusing herb residues to formulate a new generation of innovative eco-friendly construction materials. In this study, the incorporation of Needle Grass Residue powder (NGP) derived from crushing herb that originates from the "stipa tenacissima Plant as a partial replacement for coarse aggregates in the precast concrete was explored to assess its economic, environmental, mechanical, and physical impacts. Various NGP replacement levels (0%, 10%, 25%, and 50%) were analyzed. Economic assessments showed a significant reduction in concrete production costs with increasing NGP content, indicating potential cost savings. Environmentally, NGP's addition contributed to substantial reductions in CO2 emissions and improved resource conservation, highlighting its potential for enhancing sustainability. Mechanical properties such as compressive and tensile strengths decreased with higher NGP percentages, suggesting a trade-off between cost and structural performance. Physically, the concrete mixtures with higher NGP content exhibited increased porosity and water absorption, affecting the durability. The results demonstrate that while NGP incorporation offers economic and environmental benefits, it also necessitates careful consideration of its impacts on precast concrete's mechanical and physical properties. This comprehensive analysis underscores the need for a balanced approach to optimize NGP usage in concrete for sustainable and functional construction applications.</description>

                The energy transition currently defines the economic development of all market sectors, driven by technological progress and increasing environmental awareness. The requirements of a sustainable economy and green energy are evolving dynamically to address environmental challenges, emphasizing the reduction of CO2 emissions as well as energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. It is essential to study consumer attitudes toward products manufactured using green energy, including FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) products. The aim of this article is to examine the impact of the energy transformation, and consequently rising energy costs, on the decision-making process of consumers of FMCG products produced in accordance with the principles of sustainable development (including green energy). It explores the factors influencing their purchasing decisions and the role that generation plays in this process. Understanding how different generations respond to the energy aspects of economic functioning is crucial for the future development of the energy sector and the implementation of sustainable economic models. Therefore, it is essential to conduct research that demonstrates the extent of the influence of increasing consumer awareness of energy transformation within the framework of sustainable development.</description>

      <title>The incoherence of emissions accounting principles and &lt;i&gt;Net-Zero&lt;/i&gt; targets in the buildings sector</title>

                The buildings sector's energy demand and CO2 emissions are rising despite various energy standards and carbon disclosure initiatives. Drawing from the author's experience as the former buildings sector lead at the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), this paper investigates the suitability of the initiative's methodology and workflow for decarbonizing the sector. The paper demonstrates the incompatibility of current emissions accounting principles with the buildings sector and how this allowed companies to 'artificially' achieve emissions-reduction targets without tangibly improving the environmental performance of buildings. Given the sector's limited share of renewable energy, the paper critiques the initiative's disregard of buildings energy demand and questions how 'science-based' its interpretation of Net-Zero is. The paper introduces an alternative proposal whereby energy efficiency targets for buildings are derived from that share and, to be 1.5&#176;C-aligned, companies within the sector must demonstrate that buildings they own, finance, or design comply with these targets.</description>

                The world needs alternative energy sources due to the aggravating problem of global warming with the use of fossil fuels. Thermochemical routes utilizing thermal energy, appears to be a promising method for splitting H2O/CO2 into green fuels such as H2/CO with the help of a redox mediator/oxygen carrier (OC). This review focuses on one of the most promising OC, ceria, as a redox material due to its exceptional thermal stability at elevated temperatures and rapid reaction kinetics. The influence of various parameters, such as reduction (TR), oxidation temperature (TO), and the difference (&#916;T= TR-TO) during the ceria-based thermochemical cycling process was analyzed utilizing data in open literature from 2006 onward. The discussion encompasses the impact of these parameters on fuel yield, oxygen yield, and fuel to oxygen yield ratio. Introduction of a novel reactor train system (RTS) combined with oxygen pumping is found to enhance thermal-to-fuel efficiency to an impressive 40%, marking a significant advancement in the field.</description>

      <description>Hexu Cui, Advances in Economics Management and Political Sciences. 147(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406035866

                This study explores the intricate relationship between tourism development, economic growth, energy consumption, and environmental sustainability in developing countries, with a particular focus on Indonesia and Brazil. While tourism significantly contributes to economic growth and job creation, its rapid expansion often exacerbates environmental pressures, raising concerns about long-term sustainability. By analyzing the case of Indonesia, where tourism is both a vital economic driver and a source of environmental stress, this study highlights the importance of balancing economic growth with environmental protection. Furthermore, the paper performs an empirical investigation of the impact of international visitor arrivals, economic growth, and energy consumption on CO2 emissions in Brazil. Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) technique, the study aims to fill a gap in understanding the relationship between tourism and carbon emissions, particularly in the context of carbon neutrality and the Sustainable Development Goals. The findings aim to inform the development of policies that mitigate the environmental impact of tourism while fostering sustainable economic growth. This study contributes to the broader literature on the role of decarbonization in achieving emission reductions and promoting sustainable tourism practices.</description>

      <title>Energy use and decarbonisation of the water sector: a comprehensive review of issues, approaches, and technological options</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1080/21622515.2024.2440163</link>
      <description>Andrea G. Capodaglio, Environmental Technology Reviews. 14(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406094514

                Water and wastewater infrastructure is a major energy consumer and an important source of global greenhouse gas emissions: on average, 10.6 kg CO2/m3 of water is consumed. The European Environment Agency in 2019 estimated these emissions from wastewater treatment operations in Europe alone at over 25 MtCO2eq. Increased demand (in terms of volumes and quality) in the water sector raises expectations of future increases if appropriate measures will not be undertaken. Many water companies and utilities associations have been or are developing plans to achieve net zero on an industry-wide basis by 2050, and some have cut emissions by 50% in the last ten years. About half of energy-related emissions from water sector facilities could be significantly abated by applying existing technologies, and close to 95% of this objective could be achieved at zero or negative cost with proper innovation strategies. This paper examines and discusses issues, possibilities, and technologies that could be considered in planning the reduction of water and WW-related GHG emissions with a holistic view of the entire water sector, based on a recent literature review.</description>

                This study investigates the potential of Potassium Feldspar-phosphate-based geopolymer concrete as a sustainable alternative to conventional concrete, addressing the environmental concerns associated with CO2 emissions during cement production. While geopolymer concrete offers a promising path toward sustainability, its performance often falls short of Portland cement concrete. This study investigates utilizing nano-silica to enhance the performance of geopolymer concrete. Potassium feldspar powder, metakaolin, and rice husk ash were combined to create a ternary mixture that included different amounts of nano-silica. The resulting geopolymer composition's mechanical characteristics were assessed. The mechanical qualities were evaluated using split tensile and compressive strength tests. The findings revealed that a 4% nano-silica dosage (GC-N4) yielded the most significant improvement in strength and durability. The GC-N4 mix performed superior in all metrics, demonstrating the highest compressive (42.86 MPa) and split tensile (3.8 Mpa) strengths. Reduction in water absorption and durability aspects were also optimum in GC-N4. These results highlight the potential of incorporating nano-silica into a ternary mix of potassium feldspar powder, metakaolin, and rice husk ash to significantly enhance the overall performance of geopolymer concrete, promoting its wider adoption as a sustainable construction material.</description>

                Batch-cell provides a quick way to test the performance of an electrochemical catalyst. A fundamental understanding of physics behind the batch-cell operation could shed light on parameters that either could be fine-tuned to get the desired performance, or by careful optimization, overall performance of the batch-cell could be improved. Therefore, a one-dimensional numerical model is developed to study the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction in a batch-cell with three different working electrode configurations: solid electrode, glassy carbon electrode, and gas diffusion layer electrode. Experimental results of two Cu-based catalysts are used to obtain the electrochemical kinetic parameters, and to validate the numerical model. Simulation results demonstrate that both gas diffusion layer electrode, and glassy carbon electrode with porous catalyst layer have a superior performance over solid electrode in terms of total current density. Furthermore, we studied the impact of key parameters of batch-cell with glassy carbon electrode such as boundary layer thickness, catalyst layer thickness, catalyst layer porosity, electrolyte nature, and strength of an electrolyte on total current density at a fixed applied cathodic potential of -1.0 V vs RHE.</description>

                Electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, and solvation effects can alter the free energies of ionizable functional groups in proteins and other nanoporous architectures, allowing such structures to tune acid&#8211;base chemistry to support specific functions. Herein, we expand on this theme to examine how metal sites (M = H2, ZnII, CoII, CoI) affect the pKa of benzoic acid guests bound in discrete porphyrin nanoprisms (M3TriCage) in CD3CN. These host&#8211;guest systems were chosen to model how porous metalloporphyrin electrocatalysts might influence H+ transfer processes that are needed to support important electrochemical reactions (e.g., reductions of H+, O2, or CO2). Usefully, the cavities of the host&#8211;guest complexes become hydrated at low water concentrations (10&#8211;40 mM), providing a good representation of the active sites of porous electrocatalysts in water. Under these conditions, Lewis acidic CoII and ZnII ions increase the Bro&#823;nsted acidities of the guests by 4 and 8 pKa units, respectively, while reduction of the CoII sites to anionic CoI sites produces an electrostatic potential that lowers acidity by ca. 4 units (8 units relative to the CoII state). Lacking functional metal sites, H6TriCage increases the acidity of the guests by just 2.5 pKa units despite the 12+ charge of this host and contributions from other factors (hydrogen bonding, hydration) that might stabilize the deprotonated guests. Thus, the metal sites have dominant effects on acid&#8211;base chemistry in the M3TriCages, providing a larger pKa range (12.75 to &#8805;24.5) for an encapsulated acid than attained via other confinement effects in proteins and artificial porous materials.</description>

                During CO2/HCO3&#8211; reduction with renewable biomass, achieving high-efficiency production of the target products is vital but challenging. In this study, an NH2&#8211; functional-group-modified MIL-53(Fe) catalyst was synthesized using a facile and efficient method. Under the action of the NH2-MIL-53(Fe) catalyst, a clear synergistic effect was exhibited on the transformation of glucose and NaHCO3 into formic acid with a high yield of 50% at a low reaction temperature (190 &#176;C) via a three-pronged route, which mainly involved the decomposition of intermediates of glucose to gradually reduce NaHCO3 to formic acid under hydrothermal conditions. An in-depth analysis of the catalytic mechanism and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the increased alkalinity of active sites by the NH2&#8211; functional group incorporation into the catalytic system enhanced the crucial reaction steps and reduced the activation energy of the crucial reactions, including glucose isomerization, aldehyde intermediate retro-aldol condensation, and redox of aldehyde compounds and NaHCO3 to formic acid, thereby promoting the generation of target products and suppressing side products. This study addresses the challenge of reducing NaHCO3 from renewable biomass to commercial formic acid by constructing multifunctional active sites, thus providing a new strategy for achieving carbon cycling.</description>

                Microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) is a universal issue of significant concern in the petroleum industry, with the potential for enormous economic losses and casualties. This study focused on the effect of temperature on MIC and the corrosion mechanism. The corrosion rate, morphology, corrosion products, and microbial community composition of produced fluid samples from the Zhanjiang oilfield were measured after anaerobic culture at 30 and 60 &#176;C for 14 days. The corrosion rate of the Z1 and Z2 samples decreased with increasing temperature, while the corrosion rate of the Z3 sample changed from light corrosion to heavy corrosion. The Z1 sample was dominated by pitting corrosion, the Z2 sample had a relatively smooth surface, and the Z3 sample was observed to have one dimensional wormhole corrosion at 60 &#176;C. The microbial community composition by 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) sequence showed that the bacterial communities were dominated by Pseudomonas and Bacillus, and the archaeal communities were mainly composed of Methanothermobacter, Methanosaeta, and Candidatus Nitrosotenuis, which was prevalent in Z3 samples at 60 &#176;C. It suggested that MIC could be caused by extracellular electron transfer and reduction of nitrate or nitrite to N2 and NH4+ by bacteria, and utilization of CO2 to produce CH4 by archaea. Overall, the results of this study can provide comprehensive data and new insights into corrosion management strategies for oil fields.</description>

      <title>Hollow Porous Carbon Nanocubes with High-Loading Accessible Iron Atomic Sites for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electroreduction</title>

                Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have exhibited enormous potential toward electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR). The accessibility of active sites has a significant influence on their catalytic performance, especially in the mass-transport-limited catalytic reaction like CO2RR. Therefore, the rational design of SACs with easily accessible and high-loading atomic sites is crucial but still remains a grand challenge. In this work, a thermally removable template strategy combined with emulsion-induced interface anisotropic assembly method was developed to prepare iron single-atom catalyst with easy accessibility and high loading amount. For CO2RR, as-synthesized Fe-SACs supported on hollow porous carbon nanocube (H&#8211;Fe&#8211;NC SACs) display high selectivity toward CO. Most importantly, the CO partial current density of H&#8211;Fe&#8211;NC SACs at &#8722;0.98 V can reach &#8722;23.5 mA cm&#8211;2, which is 2.3 times higher than that of Fe-SACs on solid carbon sphere. The hollow and porous carbon matrix efficiently enhances the accessibility of the active sites and promotes mass transport, thus accelerating the reaction kinetics of the catalysis reaction. It is expected that this carrier engineering can provide a versatile route to improve the catalyst performance of the mass-transport-limited electrocatalytic reaction.</description>

                The article analyzes current problems of improving the rules of law of the EAEU aimed at greening the transport systems of the member states. The research was carried out using general and special methods of scientific knowledge, including formal-logical, comparative law, etc. The features of the development of world transport systems in connection with the global energy transition are analyzed, and the lack of alternative to the transition to green technologies in transport, in particular, the electrification of transport systems, is emphasized. The expediency of taking collective measures at the level of an integration association is substantiated, allowing to minimize costs and increase the efficiency of greening the transport systems of the member states. Contains proposals for improving the legal norms of the EAEU, such as the First Package of Measures (Road Map) for cooperation between the EAEU member states within the framework of the climate agenda and Appendix No. 24 to the Treaty (Protocol on Coordinated (Agreed) Transport Policy. The feasibility of forming a specialized structure in the EEC is substantiated, the functions of which would include calculating optimal target indicators for the transition to environmentally friendly transport technologies. In general, according to the author, the development of the most promising directions of transport policy in the EAEU, taking into account the energy transition and reduction of CO2 emissions, should be carried out not only by the EAEU bodies and representatives of relevant ministries (transport, environmental protection, energy, etc.), but also with the involvement of a wide range of specialists and experts, as well as members of the business community represented by transport companies, environmental non-governmental organizations and representatives of the public. The results of the study can be applied in the legislative and law enforcement practice of the EAEU, the Republic of Belarus and other member states of the EAEU.</description>

                Salinity is one of the important abiotic stresses affecting growth, photosynthesis, ion accumulation, and antioxidant defense systems in sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). This study investigated the physio-biochemical and antioxidative responses in different salt-sensitive sunflower genotypes: GP-4030 and BARI Surzumukhi 2 as newly identified tolerant genotypes, PS-2 as sensitive and Hysan 33 as standard tolerant. Salt stresses caused higher reduction in relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll (Chl) content, K+ and K+/Na+ ratio, photosynthetic rate (pN), transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (gs), and intercellular CO2 concentration rate (Ci) in salt-sensitive genotype. This genotype had higher Na+, superoxide (O2.-), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), lipid peroxidation (MDA) and proline (Pro) content than the tolerant genotypes. The tolerant genotypes maintained higher Pro content than the salt-sensitive genotypes under salt stress. All the tolerant genotypes had higher increment of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activities under salinity (12 dS m-1) than the salt-sensitive genotype. Similarly, increment of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and glutathione reductase (GR) activity was higher in the tolerant genotypes, but glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity was higher in salt-sensitive genotype. However, both monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) activities decreased with salinity level. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity increased in all the genotypes under salinity and was higher in the tolerant genotypes. Higher accumulation of Pro, along with improved physiological and biochemical parameters in the tolerant genotypes, can confer tolerance by reducing oxidative damage through up-regulating antioxidant defense under salinity.</description>

      <title>Two-stage stochastic optimization of sustainable bioethanol supply chain based on demand uncertainty and seasonal availability of biomass</title>

                Bioethanol-blended gasoline fuel is one of the alternatives for reducing CO2 emissions in the transportation sector. Since its production is still dependent on demand fluctuations and feedstock availability, an optimal supply chain design needs to be evaluated. A two-stage stochastic optimization model with mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) was developed for designing the optimal bioethanol supply chain under the constraints of multi-feedstock second-generation biomass based on seasonal availability and demand uncertainty. Two optimization models were implemented. The goal of the first model was to maximize the expected profits of the supply chain based on the optimal combination of biomass type, plant location and biomass-bioethanol pathways. The second extension model focused on maximizing expected profits of the supply chain with the least amount of impact on the environment via the reduction of net emission to result in an optimal supply chain. The validation process was then performed by comparing the stochastic and deterministic models in terms of plant location and operating decisions. The first model was applied to actual data of a Thailand case study involving 26 existing plants and agricultural residue availability. The optimization result illustrates that the stochastic model is 16% more profitable than the deterministic model for all random data sets. Furthermore, the extension model shows that carbon credit can contribute to around 5% of the total profit earned. Thus, the proposed models can address demand uncertainty in supply chain design and can be implemented by policymakers to achieve sustainable bioethanol production.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Methyl Ester&#8211;Ethanol Blends as a Sustainable Biofuel Alternative for Heavy Duty Engines</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su17010253</link>

                Agriculture may hold the key to a sustainable future. By efficiently capturing atmospheric CO2, we can simultaneously produce food, feed, biomass, and biofuels. For more eco-friendly soil processing practices, biofuels can replace diesel in agricultural machinery, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of crop production. Thus, biofuel production can be a sustainable solution for a future with a decreasing carbon footprint. This paper examines the possibility of replacing petroleum-based fuels with 100% biofuels to continue powering heavy-duty vehicles, where the use of electric vehicles is not the optimal solution. This study particularly focused on the operating scenario of heavy-duty engines under medium to high loads, typical of transport or soil processing in agriculture. Diesel was used as a benchmark, and each alternative, such as vegetable oil, methyl ester (B100), and methyl ester&#8211;ethanol blends (90B10E, 80B20E, and 70B30E), was tested individually. To find a sustainable fuel substitute, the goal was to identify a biofuel with a kinematic viscosity similar to that of diesel for a comparable spray process. Experimental results showed that an 80% methyl ester and 20% ethanol blend had a kinematic viscosity close to that of diesel. In addition to diesel, this blend resulted in a 48.6% reduction in exhaust gas opacity and a 6.54% lower specific fuel consumption (BSEC). The main aim of the tests was to find a 100% biofuel substitute without modifying the fuel injection systems of existing engines.</description>

      <title>Influence of Sodium Silicate on the Properties of Wood Ash Blended Cement Concrete</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.9734/jerr/2025/v27i11369</link>
      <description>Akeem Ayinde Raheem, Samuel Ayooluwa Otolorin, Samad Olaide Adebiyi, Journal of Engineering Research and Reports. 27(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406116918

                This study explores the impact of sodium silicate on wood ash blended cement concrete, which contributes significantly to CO2 emissions. This research holds great potential for the construction industry by aiding in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, conserving natural resources, and promoting waste minimization. The specific research objectives are Characterizing sand, granite, and wood ash, Producing concrete mixes with wood ash and sodium silicate (Na2SiO3) replacements of 0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, and 2.0%, and determine their compressive strength, workability, density, and water absorption, and Developing a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to determine optimal proportions of cement, w/c ratio, wood ash, and sodium silicate to achieve target compressive strength, workability, water absorption, and density in concrete mixes. Concrete specimens were tested for compressive strength, workability, density, and water absorption. A Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning model is significant because it is designed to capture historical information of time series data and is suitable for predicting long-term nonlinear series. The LSTM predicted compressive strength based on inputs of cement, water/cement ratio, sodium silicate, and wood ash. Results indicated that sodium silicate significantly enhanced early compressive strength and workability, making this blend a viable option for sustainable construction where early strength is essential.</description>

      <title>Environmental Assessment Concerning the Use of Char from Biomass in the Iron Ore Sintering Process</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.32730/mswt.2023.67.5-6.3</link>

                The article presents results of tests concerning the use of waste biomass-derived char as a partial substitute for solid fuel used in the iron ore sintering process (primarily coke breeze). The tests were performed in a system used for the physical simulation of the sintering process, making it possible for flue gases to be recycled back to the process. During the tests, particular attention was paid to the analysis of properties of flue gases with the simultaneous recirculation of these gases back to the process. The optimal fraction of char from biomass (i.e. not worsening either sintering process or sinter parameters) in the total fuel was determined on the basis of previous experience. It was found that the use of carbonised biomass improved the reducing properties of the sinter and had a positive effect on its strength. At the same time it was observed that the amounts of CO2 and NOx as well as of CO and CH4 emitted when using char were higher than those accompanying the use of coke breeze (only) as fuel. In order to reduce the impact of the char addition on flue gas parameters, sintering process-related tests also included the recycling of flue gas back to the sintering process. Flue gas properties were identified (both before dedusting and in the stack) using stationary flue gas analysers. The tests also included measurements of volatile organic compounds. The measurement results were used to determine the influence of the use of waste biomass-derived char on flue gas properties and primary parameters of the sintering process. The overall test results revealed failure to obtain expected reduction in the emission of undesirable compounds in off-gases (in relation to the use of the constant 15 % fraction of waste biomass-derived char and the gradual 45 % increase in the amount of off-gases recycled back to the process).</description>

                Abstract Deeply fractured rocks of meteorite impact craters are suggested as prime niches for subsurface microbial colonization. Methane can be a product of such microbial communities and seeps of methane from impact craters on Earth are of strong interest as they act as analogs for Mars. Previous studies report signs of ancient microbial methanogenesis in the Devonian Siljan meteorite impact structure in Sweden, but the proportion of microbial methane, metabolic pathways, and potential modern activity remain elusive. In this study, gas composition, hydrochemistry, oil organic geochemistry, and microbial community analyses are reported in 400 m deep fractures of the Siljan impact structure. The results showed a dominantly microbial origin for methane, which was supported by highly negative &#948; 13 C CH4 and positive &#948; 13 C CO2 values along with multiply substituted isotopologues (&#916; 13 CH 3 D) that indicated disequilibrium fractionation due to microbial kinetic isotope effects. The presence of C 2 to C 5 hydrocarbons suggested a minor thermogenic input in the gas mix. Characterization of the microbial community via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and real-time PCR indicated a low abundance of several methanogenic archaeal populations, which is common for settings with active methanogenesis. Evidence of oil biodegradation suggested that secondary microbial hydrocarbon utilization was involved in the methanogenesis. Low sulfate and high alkalinity in the groundwaters also suggested a dominantly microbial methane formation driven by infiltration of freshwater that was coupled to sulfate reduction and secondary utilization of early mature thermogenic hydrocarbons.</description>

                Adapting to climate change and controlling carbon emissions have emerged as significant challenges faced by the international community. The high-quality pedestrian space system of TOD blocks, as an important means for carbon reduction and carbon sink increase in cities, showcases the effect of green intensification and low-carbon sustainable urban space development. In this study, by combining the research on low-carbon block creation and urban microclimate, focusing on the technical process of the three stages of pre-treatment, core calculation, and post-treatment, comprehensively considering the three elements of microclimate, namely wind, heat, and carbon, and their influencing parameters, and introducing a CFD simulation method for porous media, a CFD simulation technology framework for microclimate improvement in urban design is constructed. Through the spatial visualization of the software solution calculation results and the correlation and comparative analysis of the measured data, we quantitatively analyze the coupling relationship between the block morphology and the comprehensive environment of wind, heat, and carbon. The research results indicate that by rationally adjusting indicator elements such as the height-to-width ratio of streets and entrance forms, it is possible to effectively facilitate cooling, ventilation, and air circulation within blocks and dilute the CO2 concentration. Finally, from the urban design element systems at the micro, meso, and macro levels, the adaptive planning strategies in the three dimensions of the spatial form, constituent elements, and planning guidelines of TOD blocks are summarized and refined, with the aim of achieving the low-carbon transformation of cities through the creation of a healthy microclimate environment.</description>

                ABSTRACT The University of Lampung, commonly referred to as Unila, is known as a green campus with open green spaces featuring various types of vegetation, such as shrubs, trees, and grasslands. The university consists of several faculties, including the Faculty of Engineering. However, in recent years, land use changes have occurred within the Faculty of Engineering, where vegetated areas have been converted into built-up areas, such as the construction of retention ponds and new buildings. This change has impacted the available carbon stock. The reduction in vegetated land is directly proportional to the decrease in carbon reserves stored in plants, which contributes to climate change. In relation to climate change caused by deforestation and land degradation, it is necessary to conserve and manage vegetated lands, as well as enhance carbon reserves, to measure the extent of changes (reduction in carbon emissions) resulting from land conservation efforts (Hairiah et al., 2007). The more abundant the carbon stored in plant biomass; the more CO2 is absorbed by the plants. Biomass measurement can be conducted in two ways: non-destructively and destructively. The non-destructive method is considered effective because it requires less time, cost, and effort. One technology that can be used for biomass measurement is aerial photography using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones, which tend to be effective and efficient. The Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach is an object-based method that has high accuracy in determining the available carbon stock due to dynamic changes in the extent of vegetated land in the Faculty of Engineering area at Unila between 2019 and 2024. The vegetated area on the OBIA-processed map in 2019 was 6.9886 hectares. In 2024, the vegetated area on the OBIA-processed map was 6.6652 hectares. The change in vegetated land between 2019 and 2024 was 0.3234 hectares, indicating a reduction in vegetated land due to infrastructure development in the Faculty of Engineering area. The calculation of stored carbon stock, based on field measurements, was 197.129764 tons of carbon per hectare. Keywords : Universitas Lampung, Vegetation, UAV, Carbon, OBIA ABSTRAK Universitas Lampung atau disebut dengan Unila merupakan universitas yang dikenal sebagai kampus hijau (green campus) yang memiliki ruang terbuka hijau dengan vegetasi berupa semak belukar, pepohonan serta padang rumput. Universitas Lampung terdiri dari beberapa fakultas, salah satunya fakultas teknik. Namun, belakangan tahun terakhir terjadinya alih fungsi lahan di fakultas teknik dari lahan vegetasi menjadi lahan terbangun seperti dibangunnya embung, serta gedung-gedung baru. Hal tersebut mempengaruhi jumlah cadangan karbon yang tersedia. Pengurangan area vegetasi secara langsung berhubungan dengan penurunan cadangan karbon yang terdapat pada tanaman, yang pada gilirannya berkontribusi terhadap perubahan iklim. Dalam konteks perubahan iklim yang disebabkan oleh deforestasi dan degradasi lahan, sangat penting untuk melaksanakan upaya konservasi serta pengelolaan lahan vegetasi, sekaligus meningkatkan cadangan karbon. Hal ini bertujuan untuk memahami sejauh mana perubahan (penurunan emisi karbon) terjadi akibat kegiatan konservasi tersebut (Hairiah dkk., 2007).Jumlah karbon yang tersimpan dalam biomassa tanaman merupakan indikator dari seberapa banyak CO2 yang dapat diserap. Terdapat dua metode untuk mengukur biomassa, yaitu metode non-destruktif dan destruktif. Metode non-destruktif lebih disukai karena efisiensinya dalam hal waktu, biaya, dan tenaga. Salah satu teknologi yang dapat digunakan untuk pengukuran biomassa adalah pemotretan udara dengan menggunakan drone (UAV), yang menunjukkan efektivitas dan efisiensinya. Pendekatan Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) adalah metode berbasis objek yang menawarkan akurasi tinggi dalam menentukan cadangan karbon yang tersedia akibat perubahan luas lahan vegetasi di Fakultas Teknik Unila antara tahun 2019 dan 2024.. Luasan vegetasi pada peta hasil pengolahan OBIA tahun 2019 luas vegetasi sebesar 6.9886 Ha. Dan untuk luasan vegetasi pada peta hasil pengolahan OBIA tahun 2024 luas vegetasi sebesar 6.6652 Ha. Hasil perubahan lahan vegetasi antara tahun 2019 dan 2024 sebesar 0.3234 Ha artinya terdapat pengurangan lahan vegetasi karena adanya pembangunan infrastruktur di area Fakultas Teknik. Perhitungan cadangan karbon tersimpan diperoleh berdasarkan pengukuran di lapangan sebesar 197.129764 Ton-C/ha Kata Kunci : Universitas lampung, Vegetasi, Karbon, UAV, OBIA.</description>

      <title>Anesthesia management of an infant with moyamoya disease posted for encephaloduroarteriomyosynosteosis procedure</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.4103/sja.sja_363_24</link>
      <description>Ruchi Pathak, M. Kaur, Ghazala Shabeen, Vikas Janu, Saudi Journal of Anaesthesia. 19(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4405978389

                Dear Sir, Moyamoya disease is a chronic, usually bilateral, vasculopathy with progressive narrowing of the terminal intracranial portion of the internal carotid artery and circle of Willis leading to decreased blood supply to the brain resulting in chronic ischemia characterized by symptoms of transient ischemic attacks and stroke.[1,2] The usual presentation of moyamoya disease occurs in bimodal peaks, in the pediatric age group at 5&#8211;9 years of age and in adults at 35&#8211;39 years of age.[3] This disease has a rare occurrence in the infant population so nothing much is described in the literature about anesthetic management of moyamoya in infants.[4] We, hereby, discuss the anesthetic management of moyamoya disease in an infant posted for encephaloduroarteriomyosynosteosis procedure (EDAMS). An 11-month-old female, weighing 6 kg, was posted for an EDAMS procedure for moyamoya disease. The parents gave a history of multiple episodes of sudden clonic movements of the right upper limb (lasting for 1&#8211;2 min) till the seventh month of life. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed severe attenuation of the bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid artery and middle cerebral artery with A1 segment of the bilateral anterior cerebral artery with evident multiple lacunar chronic infarcts, encephalomalacia, and gliosis in bilateral cerebral hemispheres with multiple thalamo-perforating and lenticulostriate collaterals suggestive of moyamoya disease [Figure 1]. Routine investigations including complete blood count, coagulation profile, serum electrolytes, and renal function tests were normal. Her 2D echocardiography was normal. On examination, she also had microcephaly with fused fontanelles and overriding of sutures. The power was 4/5 in all limbs with increased tone in the right upper limb and lower limb and deep tendon reflexes of the right side were hyperactive grade +3. She was on tablet aspirin (25 mg), syrup clonazepam, and syrup levetiracetam.Figure 1: MRI image showing severe attenuation of bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid artery and middle cerebral arteryOn the day of surgery, she was calm and sleeping due to the morning dose of syrup clonazepam. She was shifted to the operation theater while in a state of sleep and there was no requirement of added sedation. All monitors were attached with pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure (BP), and nasopharyngeal temperature probe. She was induced with inj. fentanyl 12 mcg, inj. lignocaine (to avoid intubation response), inj. propofol 15 mg, and inj. atracurium 3 mg. Maintenance was done with O2/air (50:50) and sevoflurane to keep a minimal alveolar concentration (MAC 0.8). 4F triple lumen central line was inserted in right-sided internal jugular vein. Left radial artery was cannulated with 24-G arterial line for continuous BP monitoring. The vital parameters were maintained with mean arterial pressure (MAP) targeted above 55 mmHg. End-tidal carbon dioxide was maintained between 28 and 30 mmHg throughout the procedure. She was extubated smoothly at the end of the procedure and was shifted to neonatal intensive care unit for close observation. The goals of anesthesia in these surgeries included preservation of perfusion in areas prone to chronic ischemia by the maintenance of normothermia, normocarbia, normotension, prevention of hypoxia, and normal hematocrit.[5] Reduction in cerebral blood flow is less tolerated in pediatric patients than adults because children have a higher cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2), hence they develop ischemia even if the cerebral blood flow is marginally reduced.[6] Any factor that reduces the cerebral blood flow like reduction in MAP or rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) should be specifically avoided in these patients as blood flow is already compromised. In our patient, the margin was even lesser due to the presence of fused sutures and microcephaly. Rise in ICP at various stages was prevented by shifting the child to OT in a sedated state, using lignocaine IV for attenuation of intubation response, smooth extubation, and good analgesia in the postoperative period. Invasive BP monitoring is required in such cases to continuously monitor for mean BP. To conclude, avoidance of factors leading to hypoxia and hyperventilation (crying, agitation), maintenance of cerebral blood flow, and normothermia are the keys to successful anesthetic management of moyamoya disease in the infant population.

                The key areas of interest in respect of which analyses are provided within the context of the paper are sustainable business practices that can help drive the change towards a low carbon economy. The study focuses on advanced techniques for managing businesses to advance the link between economic development and environmental conservation to optimize economic and environmental performance. Furthermore, based on the features, discussed in the paper, it is possible to identify the meaning of the concepts making the organizations introduce sustainability factors, as well as the possible effect these decisions may have on their future performance. This paper explores the role of machine learning (ML) and data-driven business strategies in promoting sustainable business development within smart cities. By integrating ML models across various sectors such as energy management, transportation, waste management, water usage, public safety, and urban planning, cities can optimize resources, reduce environmental impact, and enhance overall efficiency. Results from implementing these strategies in a smart city context show a 10% reduction in energy consumption (from 200,000 kWh to 180,000 kWh), a 50% increase in renewable energy share (from 20% to 30%), and a 40% decrease in CO2 emissions (from 500 tons to 300 tons) due to the use of autonomous electric vehicles. In transportation, average traffic speed improved by 16.67% (from 30 km/h to 35 km/h), and public transport efficiency increased by 21.43% (from 70% to 85%). In waste management, waste collection costs were reduced by 20% (from $50,000 to $40,000), and the recycling rate increased by 40% (from 25% to 35%). Water usage efficiency rose by 12.5% (from 80% to 90%), while water leak incidents decreased by 60% (from 50 to 20). Additionally, predictive policing reduced crime rates by 40% (from 5 to 3 per 1,000 residents), and emergency response times improved by 33.33% (from 15 minutes to 10 minutes). Finally, urban planning efficiency increased by 25% (from 60% to 75%) in land use, and green space area expanded by 40% (from 50 to 70 square kilometers).</description>

Research devoted to the study of the chemical composition, especially phenolic compounds, the use of persimmon as a raw material for the production of various food products, as well as storage methods have been poorly studied. One of the reasons for the limited consumption of persimmon fruits is due to its seasonality and unimproved storage methods [6]. Fresh persimmon fruits with high nutritional value are consumed only for 1&#8211;2 months. Most of it remains at the top of the tree, deteriorates and is thrown away as waste. From the point of view of a healthy lifestyle, the population should use this valuable food product, not seasonally, but throughout the year. Therefore, the use of fresh persimmon fruits in the daily diet, as well as determining the optimal storage mode, is an urgent problem. The object of the study is the preservation processes of phenolic compounds and the reduction of their losses during storage. To increase the body's resistance to various diseases, it is important to add persimmon fruits, which have antioxidant, antiviral, antimutagenic and antimicrobial properties, to the diet. Because persimmon fruits are rich in phenolic compounds, which play an important role in regulating the blood circulation process, removing radiation from the body, and stopping the activity of microorganisms that cause some infectious diseases. The subject of the study is the persimmon varieties Khachia and Khiakume, widespread in the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Persimmon varieties Khachia and Hiakume were stored in the refrigerator in 5 variants. Phenolic compounds were determined by performance high-liquid chromatography. As a result of research, 15 representatives of phenolic compounds were discovered in the Khachia variety, and 14 in the Hiakume variety. The preservation of the quality indicators of persimmon fruits, including phenolic compounds with antioxidant and antimicrobial properties, was recorded when persimmons were stored in a refrigerator at a chamber temperature of &#8211;2...&#8211;3 &#176;C under RGS conditions, with a gas content of 3&#8211;4 % CO2, 2&#8211;3 % O2.</description>

                In the context of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, straw returning plays a significant role in improving soybean yield and achieving sustainable agricultural development. However, the combined effects of straw returning and biogas slurry on farmland greenhouse gas emissions, soil carbon and nitrogen characteristics, and soybean yield remain unclear. Therefore, this study conducted field experiments in the black soil region of Northeast China for 5 consecutive years from 2020 to 2024, and studied the full amount of soybean straw returning (deep ploughing, surface covering) and biogas slurry ratio (R0: 100% CF; R1:25% Bs+75% CF; R2:50% Bs+50% CF; R3:75% Bs+25% CF; R4:100% Bs; Bs is the amount of nitrogen fertilizer in the biogas slurry, kg/ha; CF is the recommended nitrogen application rate, 80 kg/ha) on soil nitrogen and carbon indicators, greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions, yield, greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI) and global warming potential (GWP). The results showed that soybean yield, soil organic carbon (SOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) increased initially with the biogas slurry ratio, then declined at higher dosages. Compared to the nitrogen fertilizer treatment (R0), soybean yield significantly increased by 2.16&#8211;13.31%. Additionally, SOC, MBC, DOC, NO3--N, NH4+-N, and MBN were enhanced by 10.52&#8211;25.72%, 3.52&#8211;10.52%, 1.36&#8211;5.58%, 10.41&#8211;24.10%, 9.27&#8211;24.16%, and 2.46&#8211;5.69%, respectively. Under the same biogas slurry application, deep ploughing significantly reduced CO2 (4.29&#8211;16.27%), N2O (3.28&#8211;11.01%), and CH4 (4.21&#8211;18.63%) emissions, as well as GWP (8.96&#8211;17.63%) and GHGI (9.26&#8211;16.29%) compared to surface covering. The yield of 75% biogas slurry ratio (R3) increased significantly by 4.24&#8211;18.36%, and the yield increased by 2.16&#8211;18.36% with the experimental year, alongside increases in SOC (10.52&#8211;25.72%), MBC (3.52&#8211;10.52%), DOC (1.36&#8211;5.58%), NO3--N (11.47&#8211;25.27%), NH4+-N (10.04&#8211;22.74%), and MBN (2.12&#8211;5.74%). Mantel test results indicated that deep turning combined with biogas slurry application promoted yield and reduced GHGs emissions by increasing SOC, DOC, and NO3--N in the soil. Therefore, replacing nitrogen fertilizer with 75% biogas slurry is an effective strategy for achieving higher yield, carbon sequestration, and emission reduction in soybean production, contributing to the sustainable development of agriculture.</description>

                EDITORIAL In 2024, Science, Engineering and Health Studies (SEHS) collaborated with the Thai Institute of Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry International Conference (TIChE) to provide a platform for researchers to publish their work in the field of chemical engineering. The conference focused on the theme &#8220;Smart Solutions to Environmental Sustainability for a Better World,&#8221; emphasizing the development and implementation of intelligent and innovative technologies to address environmental challenges. The theme highlighted the integration of advanced scientific research and technical solutions into practical applications to tackle pressing issues such as environmental pollution, resource depletion, and climate change. The focus was on promoting sustainability across various sectors to improve global environmental health and ensure a sustainable future. As a result of this collaboration, seven selected research papers were published in 2024, showcasing groundbreaking contributions to environmental sustainability and innovative problem-solving in chemical engineering. Akkawong et al. (2024) proposed a novel framework that combines deep learning with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) to improve prediction models based on small datasets, addressing issues such as overfitting and underfitting due to limited experimental data. By applying this integrated framework to predict the size of silver nanoparticles, the study demonstrates improved prediction performance with R2 values of 0.924 and 0.918 for the validation and test datasets, respectively. The LHS technique was employed to augment the dataset, enabling the development of a more accurate and robust prediction model. Models trained on the expanded dataset exhibited significantly higher accuracy in predicting silver nanoparticle sizes compared to those trained on limited data. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed framework in delivering precise predictions even with small experimental datasets. To improve energy efficiency in chemical processes, particularly in distillation columns, Puangto et al. (2024) explored the design of an internally heat-integrated distillation column (HIDiC) using an economic-based column energy profile approach. The study introduced the concept of maximum energy saving per additional investment (MESAI) profiles, demonstrating the economic and energy-saving advantages of HIDiC designs over conventional methods. Using Aspen Plus simulations and economic evaluations, the research highlighted the effectiveness of MESAI profiles in optimizing heat loads and balancing additional investments, resulting in more cost-effective HIDiC configurations. The findings showed that HIDiC designs incorporating multiple side exchangers achieved lower operational costs and significantly enhanced energy efficiency. This work provides valuable insights into HIDiC design methodologies, emphasizing the economic feasibility and sustainability advantages of advanced distillation technologies. Another application model focused on developing a two-stage stochastic optimization model for a sustainable bioethanol supply chain under demand uncertainty and multi-season biomass. Fahrullazi and Siemanond (2024) considered multiple feedstocks such as rice residue, sugarcane residue, cassava residue, and palm residue, as well as varying biomass supply over the seasons. The model aimed to maximize profits by optimizing biomass type, plant location, and pathways. An extension model included environmental performance, specifically carbon credits, to enhance profit margins. The stochastic model outperformed the deterministic model by 16% in terms of profitability across various demand scenarios. In addition, the incorporation of carbon credits contributed around 5% to the total profit, showcasing the potential for sustainable bioethanol production with reduced CO2 emissions. The reduction of emitted CO2 was also addressed by New et al. (2024). They compared the life cycle impacts of conventional hydrogen production methods (methane steam reforming) with two zero-carbon emission technologies: proton exchange membrane electrolysis and methane pyrolysis. The analysis focused on five impact categories, with methane pyrolysis proving to have the lowest overall environmental impact. Despite relying on hydrocarbon feedstock, methane pyrolysis demonstrated significantly lower global warming potential and reduced toxicity impacts compared to steam methane reforming and proton exchange membrane electrolysis. The study highlighted the potential of methane pyrolysis as a sustainable hydrogen production method, emphasizing its role in promoting a circular carbon economy and reducing the scarcity of fossil resources. Two research were focused on the bio-circular-green economic model (BCG). Padettaku et al. (2024) investigated the effect of glycerol concentration on enhancing the fracture resistance of dried lotus leaves when used as a bio-coating agent. By incorporating glycerol, beeswax, and chitosan into the coating, the study aimed to improve the elastic properties of lotus leaves. The optimal ratio of glycerol in the bio-coating was determined based on the recovery percentage of lotus leaves post-coating, indicating improved elasticity. Results showed a 27% increase in recovery when using specific concentrations of chitosan, glycerol, and acetic solution. The coated lotus leaves exhibited increased moisture content and thickness, decreased contact angle, improved mechanical properties with reduced Young's modulus but increased elongation, and enhanced thermal stability compared to untreated leaves. Incorporating chitosan in the coating formulation reinforced the structure and improved water resistance. Sangjun et al. (2024) proposed the recovery of light cycle oil (LCO) discarded from the petroleum process. They focused on the hydrogenation reaction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in LCO using NiMo-based catalysts to produce higher value-added chemicals. Different catalyst supports such as &#947;-alumina, KIT-6, and &#946;-zeolite were studied. The NiMo/KIT-6 catalyst had the highest efficiency in PAHs removal (77.4%) and selectivity towards alkylbenzenes, decalins, and tetralins. The acidity of the catalyst was found to be crucial for performance, with NiMo-zeolite exhibiting the highest total acidity. The study provided an alternative method for converting petroleum refinery by-products into valuable chemicals, contributing to sustainable development, and addressing environmental concerns related to PAHs in LCO. Singhyakaew and Rueangjitt (2024) investigated the effects of alkali treatment time and the SiO&#8322;/Al&#8322;O&#8323; ratio on the structural modification of commercial and synthesized ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. The study focused on introducing mesopores into the ZSM-5 structure to enhance catalytic performance in cracking and reforming processes. The results showed that increasing alkali treatment time promoted the formation of mesopores in both commercial and synthesized ZSM-5 catalysts, leading to an increase in mesopore surface area and pore volume. However, excessive treatment time reduced mesoporosity in synthesized ZSM-5 samples, particularly at higher SiO&#8322;/Al&#8322;O&#8323; ratios. The optimal conditions were achieved with synthesized ZSM-5 treated in a 0.2 M NaOH aqueous solution for 1 h at a SiO&#8322;/Al&#8322;O&#8323; ratio of 140, resulting in a high mesopore surface area and volume while maintaining the integrity of the MFI structure.</description>

      <description>Diala Haykal, Fran&#231;ois Will, Hugues Cartier, Serge Dahan, Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology. 24(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406084617

                As the demand for innovative and effective skin treatments grows, the field of dermatology continues to evolve, integrating cutting-edge technologies with new biological insights. Among the most impactful advances in recent years are medical laser therapies, widely used to treat skin. While the immediate effects of laser treatments are well-documented, research has begun to reveal that their benefits go deeper, potentially triggering long-lasting changes at the molecular level. At the heart of this molecular transformation is epigenetics, focusing on changes in gene expression that do not alter the underlying DNA sequence. Unlike permanent genetic mutations, epigenetic changes can be reversible and are heavily influenced by environmental and external factors, including therapeutic interventions like laser treatments. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and non-coding RNA regulation, control many of the key biological processes involved in skin health, aging, and repair [1, 2]. Recent research suggests that medical lasers induce epigenetic modifications that enhance skin regeneration and repair, offering longer lasting results than previously understood [3]. This commentary aims to explore how lasers trigger long-lasting regenerative effects through epigenetic mechanisms and how this knowledge could shape future advancements in dermatological care [4]. By understanding how lasers can tap into these epigenetic pathways, we open the door to more personalized and effective skin treatments that go beyond superficial improvements. The concept of epigenetics has revolutionized our understanding of how gene expression is modulated by external influences, including environmental exposure, stress, and injury. Unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic changes leave the DNA sequence intact but modify the way genes are expressed. These changes are reversible, offering a tantalizing avenue for therapeutic interventions in dermatology. In skin biology, epigenetic mechanisms play a critical role in processes like wound healing, inflammation, and aging [5]. Studies have shown that aging skin is associated with increased DNA methylation, which silences genes involved in collagen production and skin elasticity. Histone modifications, another key epigenetic mechanism, regulate the accessibility of chromatin, the structural framework of DNA, influencing gene transcription [3, 6]. In aging skin, histone acetylation and methylation patterns become dysregulated, contributing to reduced cellular repair and regeneration. Non-coding RNAs, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), have also emerged as important players in skin health. These small RNA molecules regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by binding to messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and preventing their translation into proteins. Specific miRNAs have been linked to the regulation of inflammation, collagen synthesis, and keratinocyte differentiation, all of which are critical for maintaining youthful, healthy skin [7, 8]. Laser treatments could modulate these epigenetic pathways by reprogramming molecular processes, resulting in more effective, longer lasting rejuvenation and improved overall skin health [9, 10]. The epigenetic changes triggered by laser treatments contribute to the long-term clinical improvements observed in skin rejuvenation, pigmentation correction, and scar reduction. For instance, fractional lasers, which create microthermal zones of injury surrounded by untreated skin, have been shown to improve the appearance of acne scars by promoting collagen production and tissue remodeling [11-13]. It is hypothesized that the regenerative effects of fractional lasers are partially due to epigenetic modifications, such as changes in histone acetylation that enhance the expression of collagen-related genes [14]. In treating pigmentation disorders like melasma, which is characterized by hyperpigmentation due to the overproduction of melanin, laser treatments targeting melanocytes can modulate epigenetic pathways [15]. By influencing DNA methylation and histone modifications, lasers reduce the expression of genes involved in melanogenesis, leading to a more balanced and long-lasting reduction in pigmentation. Laser-induced epigenetic changes also offer promising results in the treatment of aging skin. Considering that in aging skin, there is a considerable dysregulation of the expression of collagen-related genes and inflammation, ablative lasers stimulate a wound-healing response that resets this dysregulation [12, 14]. Epigenetic modifications induced by the laser treatment can restore a more youthful gene expression profile, increasing collagen production and reducing the appearance of wrinkles. Medical lasers are widely used in dermatology for a range of indications, from scar treatment to wrinkle reduction and skin resurfacing. Lasers work by delivering controlled energy to specific layers of the skin, causing microthermal damage that stimulates the body's natural repair processes [16]. The most commonly used lasers in skin rejuvenation include ablative (e.g., CO2 and Er:YAG lasers) and non-ablative lasers, each varying in the depth and type of tissue injury they produce. What makes laser treatments particularly interesting from an epigenetic perspective is their ability to induce cellular stress [17]. This stress activates a cascade of repair processes in the skin, some of which are regulated by epigenetic modifications [18]. For example, the microdamage caused by laser treatment stimulates the inflammatory response, which in turn influences the expression of genes associated with wound healing, collagen production, and extracellular matrix remodeling. One of the primary epigenetic mechanisms influenced by lasers is DNA methylation, which involves the addition of a methyl group to the DNA molecule, typically at cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) islands [3]. Laser-induced inflammation leads to changes in DNA methylation patterns, silencing genes involved in the skin's aging process and promoting the expression of genes that regulate tissue repair. Histone modifications, particularly acetylation and methylation, are also affected by laser treatments. These modifications determine how tightly DNA is wound around histones, which in turn regulates gene accessibility [8, 13]. Studies have shown that histone acetylation is associated with active gene transcription, including genes that promote collagen synthesis and cell proliferation [19]. By inducing controlled injury, lasers would activate histone acetyltransferases, enzymes that add acetyl groups to histones, thus facilitating the expression of genes involved in skin repair. Additionally, laser treatments can impact the expression of non-coding RNAs, particularly miRNAs. Research has demonstrated that certain miRNAs are upregulated following laser treatments, where they play a role in reducing inflammation and fibrosis while promoting epidermal regeneration [3]. The molecular changes induced by lasers, particularly in collagen synthesis, elastin production, and gene expression modulation, directly intersect with epigenetic processes. Lasers not only affect the physical structure of the skin but also influence gene activity by inducing epigenetic modifications that enhance cellular repair mechanisms and skin regeneration. For example, the activation of fibroblasts and keratinocytes leads to changes in the expression of key genes involved in collagen synthesis and extracellular matrix remodeling, closely tied to epigenetic processes such as DNA methylation and histone modifications. The reduction in matrix metalloproteinases and heat shock proteins after laser treatment indicates a shift in the cellular stress response, potentially through epigenetic pathways that regulate protein expression during skin repair [20]. This highlights how lasers can "reprogram" the skin's cellular environment for long-term regenerative outcomes, offering new insights into how medical lasers can enhance skin health through both physical and epigenetic changes. Recent studies have further explored the multifaceted role of laser treatments, not only in skin rejuvenation but also in preventing carcinogenesis through epigenetic mechanisms. Fractionated laser resurfacing (FLR) has demonstrated significant potential in preventing actinic neoplasia by re-establishing IGF-1 signaling in aged skin, thereby reducing UVB-induced DNA damage and suppressing the formation of new actinic keratoses and non-melanoma skin cancers [21]. Similarly, no ablative fractional lasers have shown promising prophylactic effects in patients with a history of keratinocyte carcinoma, where fibroblast activation and increased IGF-1 expression contribute to a reduced recurrence rate [21-23]. In a pivotal randomized controlled trial by Spandau et al. 48 individuals aged 60 years and older with considerable actinic damage were treated with FLR. The study revealed that a single FLR treatment was durable in restoring appropriate UVB response in geriatric skin for at least 2 years, providing long-term protection. Notably, FLR resulted in a sustained reduction in the number of actinic keratosis and a dramatic decrease in non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) on the treated arm (2 NMSCs) compared to the untreated arm (24 NMSCs) after 36 months [23]. This evidence suggests that laser therapies would act through epigenetic pathways, enhancing fibroblast function and keratinocyte repair while influencing collagen production and reducing matrix metalloproteinase activity [20]. The study by Pedersen et al. found that combining ablative fractional laser with the topical treatment vismodegib led to distinctive transcriptomic changes in early-stage basal cell carcinomas in murine models. This combination treatment showed promise in modulating gene expression patterns associated with tumor growth inhibition, indicating that laser-based interventions might enhance the efficacy of topical therapies in treating early carcinogenic lesion [24]. By modulating the skin's molecular environment, these treatments offer a protective and preventive role against carcinogenesis, highlighting the intersection of epigenetics, molecular biology, and advanced laser technologies in dermatological treatments. In addition to skin rejuvenation, medical lasers play a crucial role in managing pigmentary and vascular skin disorders through epigenetic regulation, complementing their established role in enhancing skin structure and resilience. Lasers targeting pigmentary conditions like melasma influence melanin synthesis by altering gene expression through DNA methylation and histone modifications. By suppressing genes responsible for melanin overproduction, these treatments reduce hyperpigmentation and restore skin tone [15, 25]. Similarly, vascular lasers targeting conditions such as rosacea and hemangiomas modulate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), promoting healthy angiogenesis while minimizing abnormal blood vessel formation. These effects demonstrate the versatile potential of lasers in regulating different skin pathologies via epigenetic mechanisms [26-28]. The therapeutic effects observed in treating pigmentary and vascular skin disorders align with the broader potential of lasers to modify cellular environments [29]. For example, DNA methylation can silence overactive pigment-producing genes in melanocytes, while histone acetylation promotes the expression of genes involved in vascular stability and repair [30, 31]. Such interventions offer long-lasting clinical benefits by reprogramming the skin's molecular landscape, highlighting the dual capability of lasers to address both aesthetic and pathological conditions [16]. As research in epigenetics continues to progress, the potential for personalized laser treatments based on individual epigenetic profiles is becoming increasingly feasible [32]. By analyzing a patient's unique epigenetic markers, such as DNA methylation patterns or miRNA expression, dermatologists can tailor laser therapies to optimize clinical outcomes and predict treatment responses. The development of laser technologies that can selectively modulate epigenetic pathways also holds significant promise for enhancing regenerative effects while minimizing adverse outcomes, such as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning into this field is expected to further accelerate progress. AI's ability to process large data sets of genetic and epigenetic information will enable the identification of complex patterns and correlations, facilitating the development of predictive models for patient-specific laser treatment responses [33]. This integration of precision dermatology and AI-based analytics is poised to redefine clinical practice, offering unparalleled customization in laser-based interventions [34]. The intersection of epigenetics and medical lasers presents a new frontier in dermatology, with the potential to significantly enhance clinical outcomes in skin regeneration, aging, and pigmentation disorders. By influencing gene expression through controlled cellular stress, lasers can tap into the skin's innate regenerative processes, offering long-lasting improvements in skin health and appearance. As research into the epigenetic effects of laser treatments continues, the future holds more personalized, precise, and effective therapies that leverage the body's own epigenetic machinery to achieve optimal results. Incorporating an epigenetic perspective into laser therapy not only deepens our understanding of how these treatments work at a molecular level but also paves the way for innovations in skincare tailored to each individual's genetic and epigenetic profiles. This convergence of technology and biology has the potential to redefine dermatological care in the years to come. D.H. contributed to the conception, drafting, and writing of the manuscript.
