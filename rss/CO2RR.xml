      <title>Nickel (II) Complexes Bearing Electron Donating OR/OH Groups on a Tetradentate Ligand Scaffold for Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>

                Nickel (II) complexes bearing tetradentate NCCN ligands comprised of optionally protic pyridine and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors have been synthesized and used as catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction. These complexes were synthesized bearing OMe, OBn, or OH substituents on the pyridine rings and were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, UV-Vis, IR, HR-MS, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The OH substituent was partially deprotonated as shown by the crystal structure. Electrochemical studies show that these nickel complexes undergo two electron reduction events prior to CO2 reduction. Catalytic current enhancement under CO2 relative to N2 is not observed under dry conditions, but the addition of proton sources leads to modest current enhancement (icat/ip &lt; 2). Visible light driven photochemical CO2 reduction with a photosensitizer (Ir(ppy)3 where ppy = 2-phenylpyridine) and sacrificial electron and proton donors was studied, and formate is the major product with ~10:1 formate to CO production. Electron donor groups (OMe, OBn, OH) do not enhance formate production (relative to H analog), and CO production is only slightly enhanced. Overall with Ni(II), the tetradentate ligands are comparable to recently published pincer ligands for sensitized CO2 reduction, but pincer ligands offer a clear advantage in self-sensitized catalysis.</description>

      <title>Pitfalls in Photochemical and Photoelectrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Energy Products</title>

                The photochemical and photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising approach for converting carbon dioxide into valuable chemicals (materials) and fuels. A key issue is ensuring the accuracy of experimental results in CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RRs) because of potential sources of false positives. This paper reports the results of investigations on various factors that may contribute to erroneous attribution of reduced-carbon species, including degradation of carbon species contained in photocatalysts, residual contaminants from synthetic procedures, laboratory glassware, environmental exposure, and the operator. The importance of rigorous experimental protocols, including the use of labeled 13CO2 and blank tests, to identify true CO2 reduction products (CO2RPs) accurately is highlighted. Our experimental data (eventually complemented with or compared to literature data) underline the possible sources of errors and, whenever possible, quantify the false positives with respect to the effective conversion of CO2 in clean conditions. This paper clarifies that the incidence of false positives is higher in the preliminary phase of photo-material development when CO2RPs are in the range of a few 10s of &#956;g gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, reducing its importance when significant conversions of CO2 are performed reaching 10s of mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. This paper suggests procedures for improving the reliability and reproducibility of CO2RR experiments, thus validating such technologies.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Polarity of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks to Promote Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>

                The addition of polar functional groups to porous structures is an effective strategy for increasing the ability of metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to capture CO2 by enhancing interactions between the dipoles of the polar functional groups and the quadrupoles of CO2. However, the potential of MOFs grafted to polar functional group to activate CO2 has not been investigated in the context of CO2 electrolysis. In this study, we report a mixed&#8208;ligand strategy to incorporate various functional groups in the MOFs. We found that substituents with strong polarity led to increased catalytic performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction for these polarized MOFs. Both experimental and theoretical evidence indicates that the presence of polar functional groups induces a charge redistribution in the micropores of MOFs. We have shown that higher electron densities of sp2&#8208;carbon atoms in benzimidazolate ligands reduces the energy barrier to generate *COOH, which is simultaneously controlled by the mass transfer of CO2. Our research offers an effective method of disrupting local electron neutrality in the pores of electrocatalysts/supports to activate CO2 under electrochemical conditions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Over Materials Derived from Cu&#8208;Based Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks</title>

                The direct valorization of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value&#8208;added chemicals offers an efficient and attractive approach to promoting carbon neutrality. Among the available methods, the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) for producing multi&#8208;carbon products (C2+) is gaining attention due to its simplicity. However, achieving selective control over product formation remains a challenge. One key issue is the lack of a reliable correlation between the physicochemical properties of electrocatalytic materials and their activity and selectivity.To address this gap, we conducted a model study in which carbonized CuxZny@C materials, derived from metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), were synthesized with varying Cu/Zn ratios. The pyrolyzed bimetallic MOFs retained key properties of the original MOFs while also developing new characteristics. These subtle changes in physicochemical properties influenced product selectivity. Our findings showed that higher Zn doping favors the formation of single&#8208;carbon (C1) products, while it is less favorable for multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. Optimizing the Cu/Zn ratio was emphasized through characterization techniques, which will help guide the design of improved electrocatalytic systems for the eCO2RR process.</description>

                Directly converting CO2 in flue gas using artificial photosynthetic technology represents a promising green approach for CO2 resource utilization. However, it remains a great challenge to achieve efficient reduction of CO2 from flue gas due to the decreased activity of photocatalysts in diluted CO2 atmosphere. Herein, we designed and synthesized a series of dual metallosalen&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (MM&#8208;Salen&#8208;COFs, M: Zn, Ni, Cu) for artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction and confirmed their advantage in comparison to that of single metal M&#8208;Salen&#8208;COFs. As a results, the ZnZn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF with dual Zn sites exhibits a prominent visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 150.9 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under pure CO2 atmosphere, which is ~6 times higher than that of single metal Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF. Notably, the dual metal ZnZn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF still displays efficient CO2 conversion activity of 102.1 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under diluted CO2 atmosphere from simulated flue gas conditions (15% CO2), which is a record high activity among COFs&#8208; and MOFs&#8208;based photocatalysts under the same reaction conditions. Further investigations and theoretical calculations suggest that the synergistic effect between the neighboring dual metal sites in the ZnZn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF facilitates low concentration CO2 adsorption and activation, thereby lowering the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step.</description>

                Rational design of robust photocatalytic systems to direct capture and in-situ convert diluted CO2 from flue gas is a promising but challenging way to achieve carbon neutrality. Here, we report a new type of host-guest photocatalysts by integrating CO2-enriching ionic liquids and photoactive metal-organic frameworks PCN-250-Fe2M (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Zn, Mn) for artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction in gas-solid phase. As a result, [Emim]BF4(39.3 wt%)@PCN-250-Fe2Co exhibits a record high CO2-to-CO reduction rate of 313.34 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under pure CO2 atmosphere and 153.42 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under diluted CO2 (15%) with about 100% selectivity. In scaled-up experiments with 1.0 g catalyst and natural sunlight irradiation, the concentration of pure and diluted CO2 (15%) could be significantly decreased to below 85% and 10%, respectively, indicating its industrial application potential. Further experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that ionic liquids not only benefit CO2 enrichment, but also form synergistic effect with Co2+ sites in PCN-250-Fe2Co, resulting in a significant reduction in Gibbs energy barrier during the rate-determining step of CO2-to-CO conversion. Artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction from fuel gas is promising but challenging for carbon neutrality. Here, the authors report a host-guest system by integrating CO2-enriching ionic liquids and photoactive metal-organic frameworks, greatly enhancing CO2-to-CO conversion efficiency.</description>

      <title>CH4 and CO2 Reductions from Methanol Production Using Municipal Solid Waste Gasification with Hydrogen Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16198649</link>
      <description>Mohammad Ostadi, D.R. Cohn, Guiyan Zang, L. Bromberg, Sustainability. 16(19)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403190063

                This study evaluates the greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts of converting municipal solid waste (MSW) into methanol, focusing on both landfill methane (CH&#8324;) emission avoidance and the provision of cleaner liquid fuels with lower carbon intensity. We conduct a life cycle assessment (LCA) to assess potential GHG reductions from MSW gasification to methanol, enhanced with hydrogen produced via natural gas pyrolysis or water electrolysis. Hydrogen enhancement effectively doubles the methanol yield from a given amount of MSW. Special attention is given to hydrogen production through natural gas pyrolysis due to its potential for lower-cost hydrogen and reduced reliance on renewable electricity compared to electrolytic hydrogen. Our analysis uses a case study of methanol production from an oxygen-fired entrained flow gasifier fed with refuse-derived fuel (RDF) simulated in Aspen HYSYS. The LCA incorporates the significant impact of landfill methane avoidance, particularly when considering the 20-year global warming potential (GWP). Based on the LCA, the process has illustrative net GHG emissions of 183 and 709 kgCO2e/t MeOH using renewable electricity for electrolytic hydrogen and pyrolytic hydrogen, respectively, for the 100-year GWP. The net GHG emissions using 20-year GWP are &#8722;1222 and &#8722;434 kgCO2e/t MeOH, respectively. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of net GHG emissions to varying levels of fugitive methane emissions.</description>

                The selective, transition metal&#8208;free hydrosilylation of CO2 to CH2(OSiEt3)2 has been achieved under mild conditions and in high isolated yields (up to 90%) using Et3SiH and the simple, easily prepared borohydride catalyst Li+[HB(C6F5)3]&#8722;. The resulting CO2&#8208;derived bis(silyl)acetal product &#8211; whose mechanism of formation has been interrogated through detailed computational and experimental studies &#8211; can be rapidly valorized through the facile synthesis of N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes, via their corresponding imidazolium salts. By using relatively inexpensive, isotopically enriched 13CO2 this protocol can be exploited to prepare NHC isotopologues that are selectively 13C labelled at the key, ligating C2 position. This provides an electronically responsive 13C NMR spectroscopic handle with dramatically enhanced sensitivity which can directly benefit reactivity studies in both organo&#8208; and organometallic catalysis, where NHC use is ubiquitous.</description>

                The presence of carbon dioxyl as a non-combustible admixture in the landfill biogas of solid household waste and the absorption of ambient air into the layer of landfill waste, and therefore its entry into the landfill gas, significantly reduces the concentration of methane in it, which affects the efficient operation of the gas piston engine of the power plant and the reduction of volumes electricity generation. With the use of computer modeling for the composition of biogas with an increased content of N2 and a reduced concentration of CH4 &#163; 32 %, calculations were made on the enrichment of biogas to concentrations of CH4 in it of 36&#8211;44 % due to the use of CO2 amine absorption technologies, in which the costs for the regeneration of the absorbent are compensated by the produced thermal energy of the gas piston engine of the power plant. The removal of carbon dioxide from biogas makes it possible to simultaneously increase the concentration of methane in it at the input to the heat engine, which contributes to the stable and efficient operation of the gas piston engine of the power plant and the increase in the amount of electricity generation as a result of energy utilization of landfill gas. The use of complex biogas utilization technology in the cogeneration mode allows obtaining not only electricity, but also heat, which can be used in absorption amine technologies for CO2 extraction from biogas and thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere.

      <title>Boosting Microbial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electroreduction by the Biocompatible and Electroactive Bimetallic Fe&#8211;Mn Oxide Cathode for Acetate Production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c06214</link>

                The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to high-value organic chemicals by the microbial electrosynthesis (MES) system relies heavily on the electrochemical properties of the electrode materials. In this work, CO2 reduction for acetate production was greatly boosted by decorating the carbon felt cathode using the Fe&#8211;Mn bimetallic oxides, using an enriched anaerobic mixed culture dominated by the homoacetogen Acetobacterium wieringae. In comparison with the unmodified carbon felt as the cathode in the MES reactor, modification with MnFe2O4 increased the acetate production rate from 28 to 78 g/(m2&#183;d), higher than those with MnO at 59 g/(m2&#183;d) and Fe2O3 at 62 g/(m2&#183;d), and the relative abundance of A. wieringae increased dramatically from 51 to 87% in the biofilm. This was probably due to the mediated electron uptake via the redox cycles of Mn(III)/(II) and Fe(III)/(II), improved specific surface area, and enhanced hydrophilicity of the cathode, benefiting from the synergistic effect of Fe and Mn ions. Overall, this study provides a facile and promising electrode modification strategy for MES with Fe&#8211;Mn bimetallic oxides for efficient CO2 conversion and acetate production, bringing the world closer to achieving carbon neutrality.</description>

      <title>Structural Control of Copper-Based MOF Catalysts for Electroreduction of CO2: A Review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12102205</link>
      <description>Hongxin Fu, Hailing Ma, Shuaifei Zhao, Processes. 12(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403296453

                With the excessive use of fossil fuels, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have risen dramatically in recent decades, leading to serious environmental and social issues linked to global climate change. The emergence of renewable energy sources, such as solar, tidal, and wind energy, has created favorable conditions for large-scale electricity production. Recently, significant attention has been drawn to utilizing renewable energy to catalyze the conversion of CO2 into fuels, producing substantial industrial feedstocks. In these CO2 conversion processes, the structure and performance of catalysts are critical. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their derivatives have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, offering advantages such as high surface area, porosity, exceptional functionality, and high conversion efficiency. This article provides a comprehensive review of structural regulation strategies for copper-based MOFs, highlighting innovative mechanisms like synergistic bimetallic catalysis, targeted doping strategies, and the construction of heterostructures. These novel approaches distinguish this review from previous studies, offering new insights into the electrocatalytic performance of copper-based MOFs and proposing future research directions for improved catalyst design.</description>

      <title>Impact and Emission of Greenhouse Gases from Paddy Fields and their Mitigation Techniques</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.70436/nuijb.v3i02.207</link>
      <description>Kifayatullah Kakar, Asmatullah Durani, Tariqullah Hashimi, Bakhtmuneer Baber, Gulbuddin Gulab, Zabihullah Safi, No host. 03(ICCC(special))] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403170447

                Agricultural soil functions as both a supplier and absorber of significant greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2). The scientific community has expressed significant concern regarding rice paddies, as they are responsible for the production of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that pose a long-lasting threat. The primary GHGs emitted from these fields are CH4 and N2O, accounting for approximately 30% and 11% of global agricultural emissions, respectively. Consequently, there is an urgent need to accurately measure the fluxes of CH4 and N2O in order to enhance our comprehension of these gases originating from rice fields. This understanding will enable the development of effective mitigation tactics to combat future climate change. This review aims to exclusively focus on the emission of CH4 and N2O in poddy fields, while also examining the impact of field and crop management activities on these emissions. Modifying traditional crop management practices could yield substantial results in mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in poddy fields. By implementing effective management techniques, both environmental and agricultural aspects pertaining to soil can be readily adjusted. Therefore, comprehending the process of CH4 and N2O generation and release in poddy fields, as well as the factors governing these emissions, is crucial for devising efficient strategies to minimize emissions from poddy fields. This will assist regulatory bodies and policymakers in developing appropriate policies for agricultural farmers to enhance the reduction of GHG emissions and mitigate global climate change.</description>

                Abstract To address the issue of accurately controlling the carbon dioxide environment required for the cultivation of Termitomyces mushrooms in traditional carbon dioxide incubators, and improve the cultivation environment of Termitomyces mushrooms, this study designed an intelligent carbon dioxide incubator control system suitable for the laboratory cultivation of Termitomyces mushrooms. The system was based on an improved POA to optimize fuzzy PID control, regulating the opening of the solenoid valve to precisely control the carbon dioxide concentration in the incubator. Simulation and comparison tests of the improved POA-based optimized fuzzy PID control, PID control, and fuzzy PID control were carried out by MATLAB/Simulink software, which indicated that the system&#8217;s overshoot was reduced by 11.7%, the adjustment time was shortened by 71.1 s, and the steady-state error was reduced by 0.1%. The reductions in overshoot, adjustment time, and steady-state error showed that POA-optimized fuzzy PID control was superior to fuzzy PID control in terms of accuracy, response, and stability, with better robustness. In addition, the growth of the Termitomyces eurrhizus MLY19 strain in the incubator environment was compared to that of a traditional carbon dioxide incubator, and we found that the diameters of the cultured Termitomyces mushroom MLY19 cell colonies in the improved incubator were 45.3% and 73.8% larger at 7 and 14 days, respectively. Therefore, the carbon dioxide control system of the Termitomyces mushroom incubator offered a high practical application value.</description>

                The processes of carbon dioxide sequestration at obtaining various inorganic carbonate materials, including with the use of biotechnologies, and formation of organic polymers and monomers for them from CO 2 are considered. It is revealed that in the case of inorganic materials the use of slags and sludges containing a large amount of metal oxides from various industries looks the most appropriate, and in the case of materials based on organic polymers the technologies based on polycarbonates, as well as polycarbonate-containing polyols and phosgene-free isocyanates for polyurethanes are preferable. New promising methods under active development but not yet industrially applied, such as electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide and its condensation with butadiene, are analyzed.</description>

                The analysis of modern approaches and ideas for the production of new building composite materials with a low carbon footprint, including those obtained using recycled materials from man-made waste, is presented. It is concluded that the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in the production of low-carbon concretes occurs as a result of replacing part of the cement with other types of binders or special fillers that ensure the preservation or improvement of the basic parameters of the structure of the building material, or due to technologies that reduce the clinker fraction of the binder while maintaining the specified properties of concrete. The leaders in the world practice in the field of low-carbon materials science are noted. The relevance of the development of the topic of environmental safety and sustainable development is indicated.</description>

                Addressing the rise in global temperatures and the associated increase in greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, is a critical challenge necessitating innovative approaches within the building sector, a significant contributor to worldwide carbon emissions. While previous studies have demonstrated the prefabrication's potential in reducing emissions, comprehensive assessments using actual project data for buildings constructed entirely with modular methods in Hong Kong are lacking. This study bridges this gap by evaluating the modular integrated construction (MiC) method through an embodied carbon assessment of the Kai Tak Community Isolation Facility. Using comprehensive project data from China State Construction (HK) Limited, the research conducts a comparative analysis between the actual emissions of the MiC method and those of a hypothetical conventional construction approach. Quantitative analysis reveals that MiC achieves a 20.7% reduction in embodied carbon, primarily due to shortened construction timelines, decreased waste generation, and optimized material usage. This significant reduction suggests substantial potential for decreasing the construction industry's carbon footprint. The study provides empirical evidence supporting the environmental benefits of MiC in Hong Kong construction industry, promoting its broader adoption of MiC as a strategy for achieving carbon reduction targets. The findings align with Hong Kong's carbon neutrality goals and contribute to the global initiative to mitigate the effects of climate change.</description>

      <title>The Role of Catalytic Vehicles in the Reduction of Environmental Pollution in Nangrahar City of Afghanistan</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.70436/nuijb.v3i02.293</link>
      <description>Bashir ullah Safi, Fazal Rahman Mukhlis Safi, Abdul Rabi Atif, No host. 03(ICCC(special))] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403228494

                Due to the increase in the number of vehicles in the cities, air pollution is one of the serious environmental hazards because it increases the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and causes climate change. To reduce the bad effects of the gases produced by car engines, the gases are filtered with the help of a catalytic in the silencer of the car (carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, nitrogen monoxide to nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons to water vapor) before it leaves the silencer of the car. The catalytic was synthesized in 1895 from various expensive (platinum, rhodium, palladium) materials that work as a result of chemical reactions and have a high price. The purpose of this research is to inform people about the role and value of catalytic in preventing environmental pollution in the eastern zone of Afghanistan. Data was collected through online questionnaire and interviews from 102 participants. The findings of the research show that the catalytic play a vital role in the reduction of environmental pollution in Nangarhar city of Afghanistan. The study revealed that catalytic helps the cars in the prevention of air pollution. The catalytic breaks down dangerous gases into environment friendly gases before they leave the silencer of the car and so has a great role in the reduction of environmental pollution. Similarly, the catalytic is an essential part of the car that has a vital role in the health of the car i.e., the car having the catalytic will be in good condition for a longer period of time, will go with high speed and will use less fuel. Moreover, the use of catalytic is recommended in every car and other fuel consuming machines to avoid environmental pollution.</description>

                Agriculture will play a central role in meeting greenhouse gas (GHG) emission targets, as the sector currently contributes &#8764;22% of global emissions. Because emissions are directly tied to resources employed in farm production, such as land, fertilizer, and ruminant animals, the productivity of input use tends to be inversely related to emissions intensity. We review evidence on how productivity gains in agriculture have contributed to historical changes in emissions, how they affect land use emissions both locally and globally, and how investments in research and development (R&amp;D) affect productivity and therefore emissions. The world average agricultural emissions intensity fell by more than half since 1990, with a strong correlation between a region's agricultural productivity growth and reduction in emissions intensity. Additional investment in agricultural R&amp;D offers an opportunity for cost-effective (&lt;US$30 per ton carbon dioxide) and large-scale emissions reductions. Innovations that target specific commodities or inputs could even further reduce the cost of climate mitigation in agriculture.</description>

                This study investigates the oxidation behavior of Cu3Pt(100) in CO2 using a combination of ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, and density functional theory modeling. Our in situ measurements reveal the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of Cu2O due to the opposing effects of atomic oxygen and CO generated from dissociative CO2 adsorption, leading to a dynamic equilibrium state of simultaneously occurring redox reactions. Complementary atomistic calculations elucidate the inhibitory effects of subsurface Pt enrichment and the counteracting roles of CO2 and CO in surface oxidation and reduction. These results provide mechanistic insights into the dissociative pathway of CO2 molecules and dynamic evolution of surface composition and reactivity of Cu-based alloy catalysts in CO2-rich environments, with broader implications for tuning gas&#8211;surface reactions by manipulating gas reactants or solid surface composition.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Interactive Effects of Technological Innovation, Transportation Industry Development, and CO2 Emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16198672</link>
      <description>Kaige An, Li Wang, Zhenning Wang, Zisen He, Yao Zhong, Jia Shen, Xiaohong Ren, Sustainability. 16(19)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403216540

                This paper aims to clarify the intricate relationships between technological innovation, transportation industry development, and CO2 emissions to facilitate a positive synergy among technology, the economy, and climate, advancing the fulfillment of the &#8216;double carbon&#8217; goal. Utilizing panel data from 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2020, we employ the panel vector autoregressive model using a generalized method of moments to empirically examine the dynamic interactive effects between these participants. The findings reveal that the transportation industry significantly promoted the inhibitory impact of technological innovation on CO2 emissions. However, such reductions cannot counterbalance the rise in emissions from the transportation industry. Moreover, its effects varied significantly across regions. Specifically, transportation industry development within eastern China contributed to a shift in the local carbon emission effects from positive to negative under the positive influence of technological innovation. In the northeast, the transportation industry enhanced the inhibitory effect of technological innovation on CO2 emissions. In contrast, across the western region, industrial development in transportation intensified the role of technological innovation in promoting CO2 emissions. Furthermore, this work found that CO2 emissions notably diminished the CO2 reduction performance of technological innovation in the eastern part and enhanced this performance in the northeastern region. These findings further revealed the complex interplay between technological innovation, the transportation industry, and CO2 emissions. They offer insights for policymakers to tailor region-specific technologies to bolster the &#8216;dual carbon&#8217; goal and sustainable transportation development strategies, thereby achieving CO2 reduction.</description>

                Abstract Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has been recognized as a promising route to convert carbon emissions to high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels. Significant breakthroughs are usually inseparable from deeper understanding of reaction mechanisms. To this end, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been invaluable in providing detailed insights into elucidation of complex reaction pathways and prediction of overall electrochemical performance, thus bridging macroscopic experimental observations and microscopic explanatory mechanisms. Directed by MD simulations, tremendous efforts have been devoted toward enhancing the CO 2 RR with rational design of electrocatalyst and efficient construction of electrode/electrolyte interface. Herein, a comprehensive review of applications of MD simulations in CO 2 RR is emerged. To begin with, specific fundamentals along with familiar methods such as algorithm and force fields of various MD simulations have been summed up. Followed, employment of MD simulations in optimization of CO 2 RR is introduced, encompassing interpretation of electrocatalyst activity, explanation of electrolyte effect, and investigation of electrode microenvironment. Definitively, imminent challenges and avenues for optimization in future MD simulations are contemplated, envisioning this review as a guiding beacon for future endeavors aimed at harnessing MD simulations to propel CO 2 RR toward a realm of heightened efficiency, economic viability, and practical utility.</description>

      <title>Revitalizing subterranean spaces: a comprehensive study on enhancing air quality in underground shopping malls for sustainable urban living</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1186/s42834-024-00231-z</link>

                Abstract Cities worldwide are increasingly turning to underground spaces to address the challenges posed by high population density. These subterranean areas are now utilized for various purposes such as offices, shopping malls, subway terminals, and underground sidewalks. However, the semi-closed nature of most underground spaces presents difficulties in ensuring a comfortable environment due to the lack of natural ventilation. This study focuses on a representative underground shopping mall in South Korea, utilizing preliminary surveys and long-term sensor monitoring to identify existing problems. The aging ventilation system was retrofitted to enhance and assess indoor air quality. As a result, concentrations of carbon dioxide, total volatile organic compounds, and radon were reduced by over 33, 74, and 98%, respectively, while particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 &#956;m or less (PM 2.5 ) concentrations remained the same as before. This not only contributed to maintaining proper indoor air quality, but also led to a reduction in total energy consumption. The goal of this project is to improve air quality in facilities located in underground spaces, such as underground shopping malls, where indoor air quality management is challenging, thereby creating a safe and healthy environment for users and enhancing the overall functionality of the facility.</description>

      <title>LCCO2 Assessment and Fertilizer Production from Absorbed-CO2 Solid Matter in a Small-Scale DACCU Plant</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17195011</link>
      <description>Tianjiao Cheng, takeji hirota, Hiroshi Onoda, Andante Hadi Pandyaswargo, Energies. 17(19)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403250453

                This study investigates a novel method of utilizing Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology for fertilizer production. Unlike traditional Direct Air Carbon Capture and Utilization (DACCU) technologies, Direct Air Carbon Capture for Fertilizers (FDAC) has the potential to produce fertilizers directly. This study aims to assess the feasibility of FDAC-based fertilizer production by examining the current state of traditional DAC technologies, evaluating the CO2 fixation potential of FDAC, and analyzing the decarbonization effect of producing fertilizers using FDAC. Our evaluation results indicate that CO2 emissions from producing 1 ton of conventional chemical fertilizer, FDAC fertilizer (current status), FDAC fertilizer with ingredient adjustment (sodium hydroxide), and FDAC fertilizer with ingredient adjustment (magnesium hydroxide) are 1.69, 1.12, 1.04, and 1.06 tons of CO2, respectively. The FDAC fertilizer (current status) emits 0.57 tons of CO2 per ton less than commercial fertilizers. FDAC fertilizers also have the potential to reduce CO2 emissions further when the fertilizer composition is adjusted, offering a promising solution for lowering the environmental impact of fertilizer production. Significant CO2 reduction can be expected by replacing conventional low-intensity chemical fertilizers with FDAC-produced fertilizers.</description>

                Heat pumps are a promising technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE). Their use benefits from decarbonization of the national electricity mixes across the EU, as running on cleaner electricity would reduce the emissions associated with the heat generated from heat pumps. The study aimed to perform a life cycle assessment (LCA) to compare the impact of using heat pumps as a heating source in Slovenia and Serbia under different electricity scenarios that align with measures presented in National Energy and Climate plans. The results show significant differences in the environmental profiles of Serbian and Slovenian electricity sectors and improvements from the current to the future mixes (2030) with a higher share of renewables such as photovoltaics. In the impact category of global warming, an 84.7 % higher value of 1 MJ of heat produced by ground source heat pump in Serbia (0.080 kg CO2 eq) was observed compared to Slovenia (0.033 kg CO2 eq) and 85.9 % higher value compared to Europe (0.032 kg CO2 eq). The reduction in the impact category global warming in NECP 2030 scenarios that model reduction in coal and increase solar PV was observed in both countries (-17.1% Serbia; -28.6 % Slovenia). On the other hand, an increase in the impact category of mineral resource scarcity was observed, with values higher in Slovenia than in Serbia due to a higher share of PV. The study demonstrates that LCA provides a powerful tool to consider GHGE reduction and other environmental impacts, such as land use and mineral resource scarcity, and it can be used to support decision-makers dealing with future national energy plans and decarbonization strategies.</description>

      <title>Permeability evolution of sandstone caprock transverse fractures during intermittent CO2 injection in coal-bearing strata</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0231372</link>
      <description>Zhaolong Ge, Qisi Huai, Zhe Zhou, Jingwei Zheng, Qinglin Deng, Yunzhong Jia, Chunxiang Liu, Physics of Fluids. 36(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403217154

                The caprock of coal-bearing strata plays a critical role in CO2 geological storage, with the presence of fractures posing a heightened risk of CO2 leakage. The cyclic effects of CO2 injection and in situ stress influence the permeability of caprock fractures. However, the combined impact of CO2 and in situ stress on fracture permeability remains uncertain. This study conducted cyclic seepage experiments under varying amplitude stresses on fractured sandstone samples soaked in ScCO2 for different times (0, 15, 30, and 60 days). The microstructural characteristics of the fractured sandstone surfaces were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction. The experimental results indicated that soaking in ScCO2 reduces sandstone fracture permeability, but the extent of this reduction is nonlinearly related to the soaking time. During the stress cycling process, due to the effect of plastic deformation, the permeability of sandstone fractures decreases with increasing cyclic amplitude and remains relatively constant with decreasing cyclic amplitude. At the same cyclic amplitude, the permeability of sandstone fractures initially increases and then decreases with prolonged soaking time. The impact of ScCO2 and stress cycling on the permeability of sandstone fractures is the result of a series of combined chemical&#8211;mechanical effects. The combined effects of chemical dissolution and mechanical degradation significantly influence the permeability of sandstone fractures, and this impact is notably time-dependent. During short-term soaking, geochemically induced changes in the surface structure of fractures cause fluctuations in permeability, while in long-term soaking, the combined chemical&#8211;mechanical effects promote a reduction in fracture permeability.</description>

      <title>ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL OF RAILWAYS TO REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS: A COINTEGRATION STUDY OF ESTONIA'S TRANSPORT SECTOR</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.62476/ge.23209</link>
      <description>Zakariyya Abbasov, No host. 2(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403191312

                This The transportation sector is a major contributor to CO2 emissions, playing a significant role in exacerbating climate change. Railways, known for their greater energy efficiency compared to other modes of transport, present a viable solution for mitigating emissions, particularly in countries like Estonia. In 2014, transport-related CO2 emissions in Estonia were recorded at 12.7%, marking an overall upward trend since 1995, despite experiencing some fluctuations over the years. This study aims to explore the long-term equilibrium relationship between CO2 emissions from transport and railway passenger kilometers in Estonia through the application of cointegration analysis. Utilizing Engle-Granger and Phillips-Ouliaris cointegration tests, the analysis reveals a stable, long-term equilibrium relationship between the two variables. The findings suggest that an increase in railway passenger kilometers could potentially lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions from transport. These results underscore the importance of enhancing railway infrastructure and usage as a strategic measure to curb transportation-related emissions and contribute to environmental sustainability.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous seismic interpolation and statics estimation of land data</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1190/geo2023-0668.1</link>
      <description>Ali M. Alfaraj, D. J. Verschuur, Felix J. Herrmann, Geophysics. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403185372

                Imaging and inversion of land seismic data affected by complex weathering layers near the surface are challenging. When the data are additionally subsampled for economical reasons such as monitoring of sequestrated carbon dioxide and hydrogen, the problem is further exacerbated due to the combined influence of subsampling and weathering layers. On the one hand, interpolation performs poorly since the weathering layers reduce the data's coherency. On the other hand, near-surface corrections require knowledge of the subsurface model, separation between primaries and multiples as well as subsurface velocity estimation, which are difficult to perform from subsampled data. To overcome these hurdles, we combine seismic interpolation and statics estimation into a joint single rank-reduction-based algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this has been done. The proposed method simultaneously accounts for the weathering and subsampling effects, which both contribute to the low-rank structure destruction typically associated with statics-free densely-sampled data, to provide accurate reconstruction. Since a low-rank approximation is used for statics estimation, we also use it in rank-minimization interpolation as a cost-free initial solution to the optimization problem. As both statics estimation and interpolation operate in the midpoint-offset domain, we avoid the cost of transformations back and forth from the source-receiver to midpoint-offset transform domain. Consequently, the proposed reconstruction, which shows its potential on synthetic and field data is also computationally efficient.</description>

      <title>The Synergistic Effect of the Carbon Emission Trading Scheme on Pollution and Carbon Reduction in China&#8217;s Power Industry</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16198681</link>
      <description>Xiling Zhang, Xiaoqian Liu, Zeyu Zhang, Ruiyi Tang, Ting Zhang, Junqiang Yao, Sustainability. 16(19)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403217171

                The synergistic effect of pollution and carbon reduction can alleviate the dual pressure of improving environmental quality and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in China. The carbon emission trading scheme (CETS) is a crucial market-based tool for carbon emission reduction, and understanding its synergistic impact on air pollution control is essential. Based on data from 30 provincial panels in China spanning from 2007 to 2021, we employ the difference-in-differences (DID) method to analyze the synergistic effects of the carbon emission trading plan in the power industry and its influence mechanisms are examined. We observe that the CETS significantly enhances both pollution and carbon reduction in China&#8217;s power sector, particularly demonstrating effective synergy in reducing CO2, SO2, and PM2.5 emissions. Furthermore, mechanism analysis reveals that the CETS achieves joint emission reductions by lowering energy consumption, influencing the power industry&#8217;s generation structure, promoting technological innovation among enterprises, and thereby realizing synergistic pollution and carbon reduction effects in China&#8217;s power sector. Heterogeneity analysis shows that regions with limited power facility, low electricity generation, and small economic scale exhibit the most pronounced synergistic benefits from pollution and carbon reduction efforts.</description>

                Direct carboxylation of C&#8211;H bonds with CO2 represents an attractive strategy to synthesize valuable carboxylic acids with high atom, step, and redox economy. Although great progress has been achieved in this field, catalytic carboxylation of tertiary C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds still remains challenging due to their inherent inertness and significant steric hindrance. Herein, we report a direct carboxylation of tertiary benzylic C(sp3)&#8211;H bonds with CO2 via visible-light photoredox catalysis. Various all-carbon quaternary carboxylic acids, which are of significant importance in medicinal chemistry, are successfully obtained with high yields. This direct carboxylation is characterized by good functional group tolerance, broad substrate scope, and mild operational conditions. Furthermore, our methodology enables the efficient and rapid synthesis of key drug or bioactive molecules, such as carbetapentane, caramiphen, and PRE-084 (&#963;1 receptor agonist), and facilitates various functionalizations of C(sp2)&#8211;H bonds using the directing ability of target carboxylic acids, thus highlighting its practical applications. Mechanistic studies indicate that a carbanion, which serves as the key intermediate to react with CO2, is catalytically generated via a single electron reduction of a benzylic radical through a consecutive photoinduced electron transfer process.</description>

                Chronic breathlessness is defined as breathlessness that persists on minimal or no exertion despite the optimal treatment of the underlying disease and other contributing factors.1 It is a cardinal and prevalent symptom of late-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Chronic breathlessness is present in about 40% of people with COPD in high-income countries, worsening with age and severity of disease. The majority of people with late-stage COPD experience such breathlessness. COPD is also associated with a high frequency of comorbidities.2 Common symptoms related to COPD and its systemic manifestations include, but are not limited to, long-term pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue and cough. This paper focuses on chronic breathlessness. In COPD at a population level, breathlessness is more strongly associated with mortality than the measurable degree of airway obstruction.3, 4 There is also a relatively poor correlation between pulmonary function tests and the subjective assessments of chronic breathlessness. Other population-level associations with chronic breathlessness include poorer quality of life (physical and mental components)5; greater anxiety and depression; poorer workforce participation in people of working age; greater disability measured on the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHO-DAS); poorer perceived health; less sexual activity; and a smaller Life-Space geographic footprint. In symptom management, the first step in managing chronic breathlessness requires clinicians to ensure that reversible causes are optimally treated. More than one underlying aetiology often contributes to chronic breathlessness and all need to be addressed in each person's management plan. Non-pharmacological interventions include pulmonary rehabilitation, activity pacing, and a handheld battery-operated fan.6 Despite these measures, many people still require pharmacotherapy for the symptom, especially in late-stage disease. Several medications have been assessed in adequately powered studies, yet the only class of medications, to date, which has an evidence base is opioids. There are two main sources to inform clinical considerations of effectiveness of opioids for the symptomatic reduction of chronic breathlessness: meta-analyses; and adequately powered studies. A sub-group analysis of people with COPD and breathlessness in a recent meta-analysis of opioids administered long enough to reach steady state (n = 91) found an overall benefit favouring morphine over placebo.7 This suggests that there is a cohort who likely derive meaningful symptomatic benefit. Since the publication of that study, three large randomized, placebo-controlled studies have been reported (n = 284; n = 156; n = 111).8-10 Each had differing primary endpoints at different times (intensity of worst breathlessness at 1 week,9 intensity of breathlessness now at 1 week),8 and COPD Assessment Test (CAT) scores and PaCO2 at 4 weeks.11 Breathlessness remained unchanged in all three studies, however, two of the three studies reported sub-group analyses that described sub-populations that derived significant benefit. The study by Verberkt et al. found two significant improvements in its secondary outcomes: worst breathlessness at 28 days after commencing the study; and a difference between the active and placebo arms for the CAT score. The study by Ferreira et al. identified that people with the most severe breathlessness (mMRC3, 4) and COPD achieved significant clinical benefit.12 Accurately identifying patient characteristics that predict a beneficial response to regular, low-dose, sustained-release morphine remains a challenge for researchers and clinicians. Basic clinico-demographic factors have been defined in two studies using data from double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials.13, 14 In the study by Johnson et al. from four clinical studies of morphine for the symptomatic reduction of breathlessness (n = 213), baseline predictors of a greater likelihood of response included more intense breathlessness and younger age.14 Body mass index (BMI) was not available in this study. In the study by Verberkt et al., 21 participants in the active arm of their parallel arm clinical trial had a &#8805;1 point improvement on a 0&#8211;10 numerical rating scale.13 The two baseline predictors of response were higher baseline intensity of breathlessness and higher BMI. Age was not a predictor in this study. To date, exploring key single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) relating to opioid metabolism, transport or receptors has not found predictors of response.15 There appear to be a group of people (who are yet to be characterized from their pre-treatment characteristics) who have a marked benefit from regular, low-dose, sustained release morphine. The benefits are described by trial participants as 'life-changing' and persisted for at least 6 months with no increase in morphine dose.16 Although there are small numbers who describe benefits of this magnitude, the benefits were further reflected in improved actigraph-measured activity and increased Global Impression of Change scores. Opioids for pain have a wide therapeutic index. Morphine for the symptomatic reduction of chronic breathlessness may have a far narrower window for net benefit. Many people reflect that even mild adverse events negate any symptomatic reduction in chronic breathlessness.17 In a meta-analysis of 64 studies, of which five had data on safety measures, Verberkt et al. found no evidence of rising carbon dioxide partial pressures nor of any drop in oxygenation&#8212;two principal concerns when prescribing opioids for people with COPD.11 A pre-planned secondary analysis of the BEAMS study found that daytime drowsiness was no worse in the morphine arm than placebo and that, at 4 weeks, participants who reported reduced breathlessness with morphine also had improvement in Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire (LSEQ) domain scores including perceived sleep quality and daytime functioning.18 However, objective assessment of the effects of low-dose, slow-release morphine during sleep in people with COPD and chronic breathlessness has identified that although there is no negative effect on next-day alertness (including driving simulator performance), morphine causes lighter sleep depth, higher mean and peak transcutaneous CO2 and lower oxygen saturations.18, 19 The longer-term consequences of these changes are yet to be determined. Of note, any therapeutic benefit does not seem to have a whole-of-class effect for opioids. Studies utilizing oxycodone do not seem to have any signal of symptomatic benefit. Interestingly, it may also be that not all underlying aetiologies of chronic breathlessness derive the same benefits. One study in pulmonary artery hypertension saw no signal of benefit in the primary nor secondary outcomes and another in interstitial lung disease.20 At present, data from a meta-analysis and two large, randomized, controlled studies indicate that in people with severe chronic breathlessness secondary to COPD, a short trial of low dose, sustained release morphine is safe and potentially beneficial. When introduced at a low dose and titrated slowly (at least 1 week between commencing and titration), a sub-group of people derive significant, sometimes life-changing, benefit. Developing accurate methods to identify which patients derive benefit from regular, low-dose, sustained-release morphine is a critical goal for future research. T.J.A. had no disclosures.

      <title>Structural Reuse of Decommissioned Ski Lift Steel Trusses for Load-Bearing Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/architecture4040044</link>
      <description>Adrian Kiesel, G Brandi, Jael Schlatter, Andri Gerber, Silke Langenberg, Architecture. 4(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403187287

                The ongoing effects of climate change have led to a rise in global temperature, significantly reducing snow cover and resulting in the abandonment of numerous ski areas across Switzerland. As a result, many ski lifts have been decommissioned and left to deteriorate due to lenient local regulations. To address this issue, this paper presents a case study approach to repurposing steel trusses from abandoned ski lifts for a new structural application within the building industry. The design, sourcing, and construction of a new load-supporting column are described, focusing on reusing the ski lift steel trusses as a whole, without dismantling them into their components. After collection, these elements are adapted to comply with current building standards. By pouring out the hollow structure with the recently developed building material Cleancrete &#169;, a new load-bearing structure is developed. A comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) demonstrates the environmental performance of the steel&#8211;Cleancrete hybrid construction, which achieves a global warming potential (GWP) of 536.58 kg CO2-eq. In comparison, alternative designs using wood and concrete exhibited GWP values of 679.45 kg CO2-eq, +26.6%, and 1593.72 kg CO2-eq, +197.02%, respectively. These findings suggest that repurposing abandoned ski lift structures can significantly contribute to sustainable building practices, waste reduction, and the promotion of circular economy principles. The process outlined in this paper holds potential for future applications, particularly in the reuse of other steel components, ensuring continued circularity even as the supply of ski lift structures may dwindle.</description>

                The search for the microorganisms responsible for sulfide formation and corrosion of steel equipment in the oil fields of Tatarstan (Russia) resulted in the isolation of a new halotolerant strictly anaerobic sulfate-reducing bacterium, strain 5S69T. The cells were motile curved Gram-negative rods. Optimal growth was observed in the presence of 2.0&#8211;4.0% (w/v) NaCl, at pH 6.5, and at 23&#8211;28 &#176;C under sulfate-reducing conditions. The isolate was capable of chemoorganotrophic growth with sulfate and other sulfoxides as electron acceptors, resulting in sulfide formation; and of pyruvate fermentation resulting in formation of H2 and acetate. The strain utilized lactate, pyruvate, ethanol, methanol, fumarate, and fructose, as well as H2/CO2/acetate for sulfate reduction. The genome size of the type strain 5S69T was 4.16 Mb with a G + C content of 63.0 mol%. On the basis of unique physiological properties and results of the 16S rRNA gene-based phylogenetic analysis, phylogenomic analysis of the 120 conserved single copy proteins and genomic indexes (ANI, AAI, and dDDH), assigning the type strain 5S69T ((VKM B-3653T = KCTC 25499T) to a new species within the genus Pseudodesulfovibrio, is suggested, with the proposed name Pseudodesulfovibrio methanolicus sp. nov. Genome analysis of the new isolate showed several genes involved in sulfate reduction and its sulfide-producing potential in oil fields with high saline formation water.</description>

      <title>A Straightforward Model for Quantifying Local pH Gradients Governing the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c09521</link>

                The production and consumption of protons by an electrocatalyst will, under certain conditions, generate localized microenvironments with properties distinct from those of the bulk solution. These local properties are particularly impactful for reactions involving proton-coupled electron transfer, where the generation of locally basic or acidic environments may significantly influence the energy efficiency and reaction selectivity of the electrocatalyst. Whereas local pH environments have been observed and characterized in reductive half-reactions, including the CO2 reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions, the incompatibility of conventional techniques and materials has limited studies in oxidative half-reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which provides the reducing equivalents for solar-to-fuels electrolysis. With the straightforward parameters bulk pH, buffer composition and pKa, and mass transport, we develop a model for describing local pH as a function of current density regardless of the microscopic details of the mechanism. Using an acid-stable PbOx OER catalyst, we observe the formation and dissipation of pH gradients during the OER and validate the model with voltammetric and potentiometric studies. The model predicts how local acidic environments can develop over a narrow OER current density window, thus providing further motivation for the development of OER catalysts that are stable to acid, even when operating in basic aqueous conditions. More generally, the model is not restricted to the OER and is useful for determining the onset of local pH gradients for other electrocatalytic reactions that involve the consumption or generation of protons in energy conversion reactions.</description>

      <title>Vibration reduction of an electric vehicle heat exchanger by controlling the polarization of its ferroelectric ceramics</title>

                The growing requirements in terms of CO2 emissions reduction in transports renders necessary the development of new electric traction technologies. This results in new technical constraints for equipment manufacturers, forcing them to reduce the acoustic emissivity of their new products inside and outside vehicles. Heat exchangers for electric cars are part of this new product category. High voltage supplied by the battery of electrical vehicles requires introduction of a new energy conversion process and technology. To this end, components based on ceramics containing barium titanate (BaTiO3) with high electrocaloric coupling properties are selected to provide the heating function. Baryum titanate is ferroelectric. This category of materials is subjected to piezoelectric and electrostrictive effects. The vibrations induced in the components (rods) containing the BaTiO3 ceramics are transmitted through the system, and cause undesired acoustic radiation. This coupling is a suffered effect and is not taken into account in the integration process during the rods manufacturing. In this study, an experimental characterization is proposed to identify the involved electromechanical coupling coefficients. Numerical simulations of the vibrations induced by BaTiO3 are carried out and used to study the possibility of attenuating them by controlling the polarisation of the ceramics or by geometric modifications.</description>

      <title>The impact of future climate and land use changes on runoff in the Min-Tuo River Basin</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2166/wcc.2024.384</link>
      <description>Nan Jiang, Quan Ni, Yu Deng, Mingyan Wu, Ziying Yue, Mengyu Zhu, Huaizhun Ren, Yuxuan Wang, Journal of Water and Climate Change. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403296968

                ABSTRACT In the face of escalating global warming and intensified human activities, it is crucial to quantitatively assess the combined impacts of future climate change (CC) and land use change (LUCC) on runoff. This study employed simulation results of future CC and LUCC in the Min-Tuo River Basin, utilizing the CMIP6 and cellular automata (CA)-Markov models in conjunction with the SWAT model to project runoff changes under various scenarios. The findings indicate an anticipated increase in both precipitation and average temperature in the future. Projected LUCC involves a reduction in arable land and grassland, alongside expansion of other land cover types. Changes in basin runoff are predominantly influenced by precipitation, with a higher likelihood of extreme events as CO2 emissions increase. Across four emission scenarios, the impact of future CC on basin runoff varies from &#8722;5.21 to +6.09%, while future LUCC's contribution ranges from +0.05 to +0.07%. When both factors are considered, the overall trend indicates a decrease in future runoff changes, ranging from &#8722;0.27 to +0.17%. These findings underscore the greater influence of CC on runoff compared with LUCC, thereby providing a scientific foundation for ecological conservation and water resources management in the basin.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning syngas composition using laser surface modified silver electrode for CO2 electroreduction</title>

                Electrochemical reduction of CO2 and H2O to synthesize gas (H2 and CO mixture) is of significant interest due to established industrial pathways to tune the H2 to CO composition to generate an array of valuable products including methanol, synthetic fuel, synthetic natural gas, and hydrogen. However, controlled H2:CO ratios are challenging on CO-active electrocatalysts like silver. We demonstrate that applying laser engineering to adjust the surface wetting state of a silver electrocatalyst with water contact angles &#952;w ranging from 47&#176; and 135&#176;, H2:CO ratios can be tuned from 1 to 4 at modest potentials (&#8722;0.7 V versus RHE, RHE&#8212;reversible hydrogen electrode) with almost total unity Faradaic efficiency. Both hydrophilic (&#952;w = 47&#176;) and more hydrophobic (&#952;w = 135&#176;) samples showed an increasing H2:CO trend with rising potentials (0.7&#8211;1.2 V versus RHE) due to mass transport. Conversely, silver electrocatalyst with &#952;w = 110&#176; exhibited a constant H2:CO ratio of 4. This indicates catalyst wettability potentially affects *H and *HOCO intermediates&#8217; adsorption, impacting H2:CO ratios. Our results show the feasibility of syngas composition control on silver catalysts via surface wettability, providing a simpler alternative to complex multicomponent electrocatalytic systems.</description>

      <title>Climate impact of alternative organic fertilizers using life cycle assessment</title>

                Abstract Anaerobic digestion is a common method for managing liquid manure and other biomasses, generating biogas as a renewable energy source. The resulting digestate can be processed into organic fertilizers to enhance nutrient recycling, but its environmental impact warrants investigation. In this study, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to examine the impact of fertilizers derived from cattle slurry and grass-clover co-digestion on global warming (measured in CO2 equivalent) compared to untreated cattle slurry. The different treatments analyzed include untreated cattle slurry, digestate, liquid fractions from digestate separation, and an enriched liquid nitrogen-sulfur product derived from post-processing of biogas and drying the solid fraction. The functional units of this study were 100 kg of total nitrogen in the final organic fertilizer (FU1) with the cradle-to-processing gate boundary and the harvesting 1 ton of spring barley dry matter (FU2) with the cradle-to-field application boundary. The carbon footprint ranged from 24 to 49% of the baseline scenario for FU1, and from -6 to 177% of the baseline scenario for FU2. The main contributors to the carbon footprint of fertilizers included greenhouse gas emissions from storage and field application. However, biogas production from anaerobic digestion, together with the concurrent mitigation of CH4 emissions during storage, contributed most to a reduction in the overall global warming potential associated with anaerobic digestate and its liquid fraction. This study showed large climate prospects in replacing untreated slurry as organic fertilizer with alternatives resulting from its anaerobic digestion and post-treatment.</description>

      <title>Decarbonizing European Industry: A Novel Technology to Heat Supply Using Waste and Renewable Energy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app14198994</link>
      <description>J.D. Marcos, Iman Golpour, Rub&#233;n Barbero, Antonio Rovira, Applied Sciences. 14(19)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403189632

                This study examines the potential for the smart integration of waste and renewable energy sources to supply industrial heat at temperatures between 150 &#176;C and 250 &#176;C, aiming to decarbonize heat demand in European industry. This work is part of a European project (SUSHEAT) which focuses on developing a novel technology that integrates several innovative components: a Stirling cycle high-temperature heat pump (HTHP), a bio-inspired phase change material (PCM) thermal energy storage (TES) system, and a control and integration twin (CIT) system based on smart decision-making algorithms. The objective is to develop highly efficient industrial heat upgrading systems for industrial applications using renewable energy sources and waste heat recovery. To achieve this, the specific heat requirements of different European industries were analyzed. The findings indicate that industrial sectors such as food and beverages, plastics, desalination, textiles, ceramics, pulp and paper, wood products, canned food, agricultural products, mining, and chemicals, typically require process heat at temperatures below 250 &#176;C under conditions well within the range of the SUSHEAT system. Moreover, two case studies, namely the Pelagia and Mandrekas companies, were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the system. An analysis of the annual European heat demand by sector and temperature demonstrated that the theoretical potential heat demand that could be met by the SUSHEAT system is 134.92 TWh annually. Furthermore, an environmental impact assessment estimated an annual significant reduction of 19.40 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. These findings underscore the significant potential of the SUSHEAT system to contribute to the decarbonization of European industry by efficiently meeting heat demand and substantially reducing carbon emissions.</description>

      <title>Synthesis, Characterization, and Shaping of UiO-67 Metal-Organic Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.33540/2439</link>

                This PhD thesis investigates the flexibility of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) materials, particularly focusing on their adaptable synthesis and shaping techniques. MOFs, known for their dynamic framework structures and flexible linkers, allow researchers to design new and existing porous materials for specific applications, such as catalysis and environmental protection. The research covers a range of topics, including synthesis, characterization, shaping, and catalytic testing, with particular emphasis on the flexible properties of MOFs. Chapter 2 focuses on the application of MOFs in active coatings on surfaces and functionalized fabrics to deactivate biological and chemical toxins, a crucial topic in light of the global health crisis induced by the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The chapter discusses advancements in metal- and metal-oxide-based catalysts for inactivating chemical and biological threats. It also explores MOF applications in textiles, which are designed to capture and degrade chemical warfare agents. Despite progress, challenges remain, particularly in translating laboratory results to real-world conditions, such as creating multifunctional protective suits that are durable and capable of detoxifying toxins while remaining comfortable. The chapter highlights the promise of MOFs in addressing these challenges, but also the need for improved manipulation onto fibers and long-term stability. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 delve into the catalytic potential of MOFs and their manipulation for specific applications. In Chapter 3, the focus is on the catalytic activity of platinum nanoparticles (Pt-NPs) embedded within the UiO-67 MOF structure, specifically investigating their role in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The study examines the effects of reduction and pyrolysis treatments on Pt-NPs, finding that certain treatment processes improve the selectivity for methanol formation. This chapter emphasizes the importance of understanding the catalytic properties of MOFs and their potential for CO2 conversion. Chapter 4 investigates surface-mounted MOFs (SURMOFs), which offer promising in situ measurement capabilities. The chapter discusses the synthesis and characterization of three different SURMOF materials: UU-1, ZIF-8, and UiO-67. It explores how different anchor molecules, substrates, and synthetic conditions affect the growth and morphology of these SURMOFs. The chapter also addresses the limitations of current analytical techniques and proposes transmission-based characterization on transparent substrates. The findings highlight the importance of spectroscopic characterization in understanding the behavior of SURMOFs during various processes, offering insights for their application in fields like sensing, separation, and catalysis. Finally, Chapter 5 addresses the challenge of shaping MOFs via mechanical pressure by presenting a synthesis procedure that forms MOF beads through entanglement with chitosan (CS). This method eliminates the need for mechanical pressure, which can be detrimental to MOF structures. The study compares two synthesis procedures&#8212;one-pot synthesis (OPS) and post-synthetic functionalization (PSF)&#8212;and finds that OPS leads to better incorporation of MOFs into CS beads, resulting in higher thermal stability. Overall, this thesis demonstrates the versatility of MOFs in catalysis, environmental protection, and material science, while also addressing the challenges associated with shaping and long-term stability.</description>

                Our understanding of cardiovascular haemodynamics and the factors that govern it is vital for appreciating the workings of a healthy physiological system, as well as elucidating the pathophysiology behind disease and identifying potential treatment options. A recent article in The Journal of Physiology by Watanabe et al. (2024) sought to contribute to this field by exploring the impact of passive hyperthermia on human circulation and the underlying central and peripheral mechanisms. It has traditionally been believed that blood circulation is driven by the pressure created by the heart (Furst &amp; Gonz&#225;lez-Alonso, 2023). In hyperthermia, cardiac output is increased, and the traditional perspective would suggest that this is mainly due to an increased heart rate, supplemented by central mechanisms such as increased left ventricular systolic function. However, studies have shown that an increased heart rate alone is not sufficient to increase cardiac output (Joyce &amp; Wang, 2021). Also, central mechanisms exert their effects with increases in core temperature at rest, which would not explain the increase in cardiac output seen with peripheral hyperthermia that does not affect core temperature. Therefore, it appears that other factors are involved in increasing cardiac output in peripheral hyperthermia, potentially including increased blood velocity or increased systemic vascular conductance. The exact mechanisms and their relationship to central forces are not well elucidated, and this is what Watanabe et al. (2024) set out to understand. The main aim set by Watanabe et al. (2024) was to explore how single-leg, two-leg, and whole-body hyperthermia affect peripheral and systemic circulation, as well as the metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses. They also aimed to investigate the factors affecting central haemodynamic changes in hyperthermia. Their hypothesis was that passive hyperthermia increases cardiac output, not due to central mechanisms like left ventricular contractility, but rather due to peripheral haemodynamic changes. The researchers enrolled eight young healthy males, and each participant was randomly assigned four counterbalanced protocols. These were 3 h of no heating as a control, 3 h of single-leg heating, 3 h of two-leg heating and 2.5 h of whole-body heating. The latter is shorter due to participant discomfort leading to early termination. The heating was provided using a water-perfused garment, and extensive measurements were taken throughout the protocols. To evaluate leg, arm, and head haemodynamics, ultrasound was used to measure blood flow at the common femoral artery, brachial artery, and common and internal carotid arteries. To evaluate cardiac function, echocardiography was used. Participants also underwent blood sampling, as well as respiratory, metabolic, blood pressure, and heart rate measurements. In single-leg heating, the study found that blood flow only increased in the leg. The two-leg and whole-body heating protocols, however, showed increased blood flow to both legs and forearms, with whole-body heating also leading to increased extracranial blood flow. None of the heating trials showed a significant difference in anterior cerebral blood flow. This finding is particularly interesting given the progressive increase in cardiac output across protocols. These results suggest that local mechanisms controlling blood flow differ across body sites, and that increased cardiac output alone does not increase perfusion. Importantly, the authors found that blood velocity increased to a greater extent than vessel diameter size, indicating that velocity predominantly contributed to the observed increase in blood flow. Additionally, there was a progressive increase in systemic vascular conductance across all heating protocols, along with increased blood kinetic energy in both two-leg and whole-body heating. Using correlational analysis, the authors showcased that increased local temperature was associated with increased local blood flow and vascular conductance. Further analysis suggests that increased cardiac output is linked with not only the aforementioned factors but also increased blood velocity and kinetic energy in the limbs and head. This supports the study's hypothesis and highlights that peripheral mechanisms may be more important than previously thought. Evaluating cardiac function revealed some key findings. Left ventricular ejection fraction and heart rate increased in all heating sessions. However, alongside the increase in heart rate was a reduction in left ventricular filling and ejection times. Despite this, stroke volume was increased or maintained in all heating protocols. This finding is likely to be due to an increase in venous return to the heart, with an increase in left ventricular end diastolic volume and a reduction in the end systolic volume. Collectively, these results indicate that hyperthermia not only drives heart rate but crucially increases venous return to enhance cardiac output. This goes against existing literature, which suggests hyperthermia reduces preload (Wilson &amp; Crandall, 2011), possibly due to factors such as the method of assessing preload, environmental conditions, and participant characteristics. Further research would help to confirm this result. A unique finding was that whole-body heating increased left ventricular twist and untwisting rate, an effect not seen with leg-only heating. This suggests that systemic hyperthermia may engage more comprehensive cardiac adjustments, and that peripheral heating increases cardiac output without necessarily relying on central cardiac mechanisms. These findings come together to suggest an alternative model of circulation, contrary to the traditional cardio-centric view. The study found that respiratory and metabolic responses only changed in the whole-body heating protocol. There was an increase in oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output, pulmonary ventilation, and end-tidal O2 pressure. In contrast, these changes were not observed in leg-only heating, yet cardiac output still increased. This differentiation suggests that metabolic and respiratory factors are not essential for increasing blood flow in peripheral hyperthermia, thereby strengthening the hypothesis of the study. However, it also shows the ongoing role of central mechanisms in certain hyperthermia conditions. This study is thoughtfully planned and provides robust data supporting the hypothesis. However, it should be noted that there are some limitations. One such limitation is the small and specific sample size of young healthy males. Although this is understandable in the context of an initial study exploring physiology in a normal state, it does reduce the generalisability of the results to other populations such as females and older groups with cardiovascular illness. Additionally, many measurements were derived using ultrasound, which tends to have a degree of inter-operator variability. It is unclear whether one or more operators were involved in conducting these measurements. However, the authors provide a thorough explanation of the ultrasound techniques used. Furthermore, the study did not directly measure right heart function or venous flow to the heart, instead inferring venous return data from their left ventricular recordings. Although this may lead to inaccuracies, similar techniques have been previously used and support this method. The authors also acknowledged that they used correlational analysis to evaluate the link between cardiac output and peripheral circulation, appropriately highlighting that this does not establish causation. The authors provide us with new insights into how human circulation is controlled, in a field where specific mechanisms behind heat-related changes are not well understood. With a deeper understanding of peripheral haemodynamics and the relationship with cardiac output, we are better positioned to conduct future research and explore treatment options for cardiovascular disease. For example, one can evaluate these findings in the context of heart failure and the potential use of lower limb heating to improve cardiac output. Although this has been previously studied (Inoue et al., 2012), there is a dearth of literature. Another interesting possibility is the use of the measurements from this study, such as blood kinetic energy, as markers of disease onset and progression, given their suggested importance. This is an important study from Watanabe et al. (2024), employing a well thought out methodology to suggest that peripheral mechanisms in passive hyperthermia are key to controlling blood circulation. They demonstrate that increases in cardiac output are linked with increases in local velocity and kinetic energy of blood flow secondary to heat, rather than central mechanisms. While there are some limitations to the research, the findings provide new insights into the study of human circulation and establish a platform for further research. This should include further physiological research in diverse populations to confirm the results, as well as clinical research to understand changes found in pathology and to identify possible treatment options.
