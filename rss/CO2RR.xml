      <title>Unravelling the Effect of Crystal Facet of Derived&#8208;Copper Catalysts on the Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide under Unified Mass Transport Condition</title>

                Altering the physical structure and chemical property of copper, i.e., particle size, surface morphology, composition or crystal facet, has been demonstrated to be effective in steering the selectivity of products in electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. However, these modifications generally result in the change of active surface area, leading to differences in the geometric current density and local pH, which are also demonstrated to be the key factors for observed selectivity change. In this work, we deconvolute the effect of mass transport and local pH from the effect of crystal facet by investigating five copper&#8208;based catalysts with identical roughness factors for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in an H&#8208;cell. Interestingly, CuO&#8208;derived catalyst stands out as the best catalyst for C&#8208;C coupling. At &#8208;1.07 V vs. RHE, the faradaic efficiency of C2+ product reaches 44.3%, with a partial current density of &#8208;10.8 mA cm&#8208;2. Electrochemical adsorption of *OH reveals that the C2+ product selectivity of derived&#8208;copper catalysts correlates positively with the ratio of Cu(100)/Cu(110) of five catalysts. Additionally, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the percentage of low&#8208;frequency band linear CO (LFB&#8208;CO), which is attributed to the adsorbed *CO on Cu(100) facet, increases with the C&#8208;C coupling efficiency.</description>

      <title>On the electrochemical CO2 reduction by Bi-based catalysts: single
  crystals or mixture phases</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2409.11648</link>

                Metallic bismuth is both non-toxic and cost-effective. Bi-based catalysts have demonstrated the ability to efficiently produce HCOOH through CO2RR while effectively inhibiting the HER. Although many experiments have been reported concerning its performance towards CO2 reduction, the impact its valence states and crystal faces on CO2RR selectivity (e.g. HCOOH versus CO) it still under debate. Here, we performed a comprehensive study via density functional theory, by including three typical valence states of Bi, such as 0 (Bi), +3 (Bi2O3) and +5 (Bi2O5), as well as their often-studied crystal facets. The results show that metallic Bi demonstrates a poor selectivity for HCOOH, but boasts a higher conversion rate for CO2. While Bi2O3 exhibits a good selectivity for HCOOH production, yet it displays a lower conversion rate for CO2. For Bi2O5, all studied surfaces show high energy barriers in both cases of HCOOH and CO production, and lower energy barriers for HER reactions, indicating that Bi at +5 valence state is not the good choice for 2e transfer reactions. Subsequently, we further examined the effects of oxygen contents on the selectivity of HCOOH and the conversion rate for CO2. Interestingly, we found that partial oxidization of Bi benefits both the selectivity and the conversion rate. With these observations, we suggest that a mixture of Bi (0) and Bi2O3 (+3) phases would be a better choice than single crystals for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Operando condition modeling CO2 electrocatalytic reduction on Ni-N-C single atom catalysts</title>

                Abstract The performance of electrocatalysts is shaped not solely by the inherent structures of active sites but also by factors like the charge accumulation on the electrode surface and the electric double-layer (EDL) structure formed at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte. At present, accurately modeling the electrochemical reactions occurring at EDL is a great challenge, mainly because the dynamic chemical change cannot be adequately captured by the commonly used static configurations. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations face difficulty sampling across both time and space scales. Here, utilizing Ni-N-C/G catalysis CO2 reduction to CO as a framework to examine, we explored the catalytic process affected by EDL and accumulated electron on electrode under operando conditions by integrating grand canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT) calculations with classical molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The findings suggest that the negative charge accumulating on the cathode material plays a crucial role in facilitating the adsorption and activation of CO2. Additionally, incorporating two intermediates, *COO + OH- and *CO + OH-, can significantly enhance the accuracy of the free energy profile. Moreover, the EDL can not only enhance the adsorption of CO2 and promote the cleavage of the C-OH (in the *COOH intermediate) but also inhibit the desorption of CO to some extent. Compared to the promotional effect induced by cations coordinating with intermediates, the primary promoting factor lies in the electric field (EF around 85%) distributed around the intermediates. With the inclusion of the EDL correction, our calculations align well with experimental observations, showing that for the CO2 reduction to CO on the Ni-N-C site, as the applied potential becomes increasingly negative, the rate-determining step shifts from *COOH formation to CO desorption at -0.60 VRHE. Our work not only explains a long-standing puzzle for an important catalyst but also highlights the crucial roles of EDL effects, which provide guidance on investigating electrochemical reactions without compromising the complexity of the electrode environment.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Proton Source for CO2 Electro-reduction on Cu(100) using Many-body Perturbation Theory</title>

                The protonation of CO is recognized as the rate-determining step in the generation of C1 products during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) on Cu surfaces. Despite its importance, the detailed mechanism and the precise proton source for this elementary step remain elusive and are under intense debate. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations have been used to investigate such a mechanism. However, semi-local functionals at the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) level face significant challenges in accurately describing adsorbate-metal interactions and surface stability. In this work, we employed the Random Phase Approximation (RPA), a method based on many-body perturbation theory, to overcome these limitations. We coupled the RPA framework with the linearized Poisson&#8211;Boltzmann equation to model solvation effects and incorporated a surface charging method to account for the influence of the electrochemical potential. Our study reveals that, in neutral or alkaline electrolytes, adsorbed water at the surface acts as the proton source for the reduction of *CO to *COH over a wide range of potentials via the Grotthuss mechanism. At highly negative potentials, solvent water becomes the primary proton donor, with multiple competing mechanisms observed. In contrast, DFT-GGA functionals not only significantly underestimate the reaction barriers for *COH formation but also consistently predict solvent water as the proton source across all the potentials of interest. Additionally, RPA offers distinct insights into H2O adsorption and highlights the significant range of reducing potential within which surface *OH can exist, which is crucial for accurate CO2RR modeling. These potential-dependent thermodynamic and kinetic data illustrate a pronounced divergence between the mechanistic insights offered by RPA and those derived from DFT-GGA functionals. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on proton transfer in CO2RR and establish a framework for future theoretical studies of electrochemical processes.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the potential of deep eutectic solvents in biocatalysis: design strategies using CO2 to formate reduction as a case study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2024.1467810</link>

                Introduction Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as green solvents with versatile applications, demonstrating significant potential in biocatalysis. They often increase the solubility of poorly water-soluble substrates, serve as smart co-substrates, modulate enzyme stereoselectivity, and potentially improve enzyme activity and stability. Despite these advantages, screening for an optimal DES and determining the appropriate water content for a given biocatalytic reaction remains a complex and time-consuming process, posing a significant challenge. Methods This paper discusses the rational design of DES tailored to a given biocatalytic system through a combination of experimental screening and computational tools, guided by performance targets defined by solvent properties and process constraints. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by the reduction of CO 2 to formate catalyzed by NADH-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH). By systematically analyzing FDH activity and stability, NADH stability (both long-term and short-term stability after solvent saturation with CO 2 ), and CO 2 solubility in initially selected glycerol-based DESs, we were able to skillfully guide the DES screening process. Results and discussion Considering trade-offs between experimentally determined performance metrics of DESs, 20% solution of choline chloride:glycerol in phosphate buffer (ChCl:Gly 80%B ) was identified as the most promising solvent system for a given reaction. Using ChCl:Gly as a co-solvent resulted in an almost 15-fold increase in FDH half-life compared to the reference buffer and stabilized the coenzyme after the addition of CO 2 . Moreover, the 20% addition of ChCl:Gly to the buffer improved the volumetric productivity of FDH-catalyzed CO 2 reduction in a batch system compared to the reference buffer. The exceptional stability of the enzyme in this co-solvent system shows great potential for application in continuous operation, which can significantly improve process productivity. Additionally, based on easily measurable physicochemical solvent properties and molecular descriptors derived from COSMO-RS, QSAR models were developed, which successfully predicted enzyme activity and stability, as well as coenzyme stability in selected solvent systems with DESs.</description>

                In this study, we designed and prepared polyoxometalate@metal&#8208;organic framework (POM@MOF) composite catalysts through the anchoring of a sandwich POM [(PW9O34)2Co4(H2O)2]10&#8722; (shortened as P2W18Co4) to the hexagonal channel of the PCN&#8211;222 (metal&#8208;free) or PCN&#8211;222(M) (M=Fe, Co) frameworks. The composite materials were applied to the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 reaction (CO2RR) to analyse the effect of incorporating P2W18Co4 on catalytic activity. The P2W18Co4@PCN&#8211;222 composite exhibited enhanced activity across a wide potential range (&#8211;0.60~ &#8211;0.85 V vs. RHE) and an optimal FECO of 72% at &#8211;0.75 V vs. RHE, which was more than double that of PCN&#8211;222 (FECO= 33%). The current density surpassed that of the PCN&#8211;222 precursors by over sixteen times at the same potential. In contrast, the P2W18Co4@PCN&#8211;222(M) composite demonstrated decreased current density, minimal enhancement in CO2RR activity, and a competing HER behaviour. Density functional theory calculations were conducted on simplified models of P2W18Co4@H2&#8211;TCPP and P2W18Co4@M&#8211;TCPP to elucidate the divergent catalytic performances. The findings revealed that while both configurations exhibited the same rate&#8208;limiting step (formation of the *COOH intermediate), a significantly reduced reaction barrier was only observed in the P2W18Co4@H2&#8211;TCPP setup, explaining its substantial activity improvement.</description>

                The direct utilization of carbon dioxide as an ideal one-carbon source in value-added chemical synthesis has garnered significant attention from the standpoint of global sustainability. In this regard, the photo/electrochemical reduction of CO2 into useful fuels and chemical feedstocks could offer a great promise for the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. However, challenges in product selectivity continue to limit the practical application of these systems. A robust and general method for the conversion of CO2 to the polarity-reversed carbon dioxide radical anion, a C1 synthon, is critical for the successful valorization of CO2 to selective carboxylation reactions. We demonstrate herein a hydride and hydrogen atom transfer synergy driven general catalytic platform involving CO2&#8226;&#8211; for highly selective anti-Markovnikov hydrocarboxylation of alkenes via triple photoredox, hydride, and hydrogen atom transfer catalysis. Mechanistic studies suggest that the synergistic operation of the triple catalytic cycle ensures a low-steady-state concentration of CO2&#8226;&#8211; in the reaction medium. This method using a renewable light energy source is mild, robust, selective, and capable of accommodating a wide range of activated and unactivated alkenes. The highly selective nature of the transformation has been revealed through the synthesis of hydrocarboxylic acids from the substrates bearing a hydrogen atom available for intramolecular 1,n-HAT process as well as diastereoselective synthesis. This technology represents a general strategy for the merger of in situ formate generation with a synergistic photoredox and HAA catalytic cycle to provide CO2&#8226;&#8211; for selective chemical transformations.</description>

                Selective CO2 hydrogenation faces significant technical challenges, although many efforts have been made in this regard. Herein, a Ni-doped In2O3 catalyst supported by g-C3N4 was prepared using the co-precipitation method, and its composition, morphology, specific surface area, and band gap were characterized using TEM, XPS, BET, XRD, CO2-TPD, H2-TPR, UV-Vis, etc. The catalytic hydrogenation reduction of CO2 to produce methanol was tested. Under low-photothermal conditions (1.0 MPa), the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to methanol is stable, effective, and highly selective, with a spatiotemporal yield of 86.0 gMeOHh&#8722;1 kgcat&#8722;1, which is 30.9% higher than that of Ni-In2O3 without g-C3N4 loading under the same conditions.</description>

Mirasgedis, Michel Ramonet, Cl&#233;ment Narbaud, Morgan Lopez, Dimitris Balis, Konstantinos Eleftheriadis, Maria Kanakidou, N. Mihalopoulos, Atmosphere. 15(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403843514

                This study provides an overview of the atmospheric drivers of climate change over Greece (Eastern Mediterranean), focusing on greenhouse gases (GHG: carbon dioxide, CO2; methane, CH4; etc.). CO2 in Greece is mostly produced by energy production, followed by transport, construction, and industry. Waste management is the largest anthropogenic source of methane, accounting for 47% of total CH4 emissions, surpassing emissions from the agricultural sector in 2017, while the energy sector accounts for the remaining 10.5%. In situ simultaneous observations of GHG concentrations in Greece conducted at three sites with different topologies (urban background; Athens, regional background; Finokalia and free troposphere; and Helmos) during the last 5 years (2019&#8211;2023) showed increasing trends of the order of 2.2 ppm&#183;yr&#8722;1 and ~15 ppb&#183;yr&#8722;1 for CO2 and CH4, respectively, in line with the global trends. These increasing trends were found from both ground-based and satellite-based remote-sensing observations. Finally, during the lockdown period due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, a 58% reduction in CO2 levels was observed in the urban background site of Athens after subtracting the regional background levels from Finokalia, while the respective reduction in CH4 was of only the order of 15%, highlighting differences in emission sources.</description>

      <title>The Synergy Between CO2 and Air Pollution Emissions in Chinese Cities by 2060: An Assessment Based on the Emissions Inventory and Dynamic Projection Model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16219338</link>
      <description>Guosheng Wang, Wei Xia, Yang Xiao, X. L. Guan, Xin Zhang, Sustainability. 16(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403834976

                Synergizing air pollution control and climate change mitigation has been of significant academic and policy concern. The synergy between air pollution and carbon emissions is one of the measures to understand the characteristics and process of the air pollution&#8211;carbon synergistic control, which will also provide valuable information for collaboratively achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (such as SDGs 11 and 13). This study establishes a systematic framework integrating emissions inventory and projection models, correlation mining and typology analysis methods to predictively evaluate the synergy and comprehensive coordination between air pollution and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Chinese cities by 2030, 2050, and 2060 under different policy scenarios for air pollution and CO2 emissions control. The results reveal the significant effects of synergistically implementing clean air and aggressive carbon-reducing policies on mitigating air pollution and CO2 emissions. Under the On-time Peak-Net Zero-Clean Air and Early Peak-Net Zero-Clean Air scenarios, the total reduction and synergy for air pollution and CO2 emissions will be more significant, particularly by 2050 and 2060. This study is the first to integrate scenario projection and synergy evaluation in air pollution and CO2 research, providing a novel supplement to the air pollution&#8211;climate change synergy methodology based on co-benefit estimation. The methods and findings will also contribute to measuring the achievement and analyzing the interaction of the SDGs.</description>

                Abstract This study highlights the significant potential of activated carbon-based materials in environmental remediation and energy production, particularly in converting carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) into methane (CH4) and water (H2O) using transition metal-based catalysts. It emphasizes the role of porous AC in waste reduction and resource utilization, examining various applications of CO2 and evaluating environmental impacts. The research explores commercialization opportunities and specifically investigates CO2 methanation using activated carbon-based materials. Using bibliometric analyses of 4196 articles from the Web of Science database, the study identifies a growing research interest in porous activated carbon-related CO2 methanation from 2014 to 2024. The top three journals in this field are Environment Development and Sustainability, Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery, and Journal of Environment Science and Pollution. However, there is limited inter-institutional collaboration in this field, suggesting room for development towards commercializing sustainable CH4 production pathways. CH4 is highlighted as a crucial intermediate in industrial processes, and research directions are identified through co-occurring author keywords analysis. The study suggests the need for a comprehensive approach integrating activated carbon materials into carbon-neutral energy processes while addressing the potential adverse effects of activated carbon nanoparticles on biological and environmental factors. Ultimately, it clarifies the potential uses and commercialization prospects for porous AC materials, especially in conjunction with carbon capture and utilization technologies, promoting sustainable practices in energy production and environmental management.</description>

                Optimizing the binding energy between the intermediate and the active site is a key factor for tuning catalytic product selectivity and activity in the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Copper active sites are known to reduce CO2 to hydrocarbons and oxygenates, but suffer from poor product selectivity due to the moderate binding energies of several of the reaction intermediates. Here, we report an ion exchange strategy to construct Cu&#8208;Pd paddle wheel dimers within Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu3&#8208;xPdx(BTC)2] (BTC = benzentricarboxylate), without altering the overall MOF structural properties. Compared to the pristine Cu MOF ([Cu3(BTC)2], HKUST&#8208;1), the Cu&#8208;Pd MOF shifts CO2 electroreduction products from diverse chemical species to selective CO generation. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis of the catalyst oxidation state and local geometry, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that the incorporation of Pd within the Cu&#8208;Pd paddle wheel node structure of the MOF promotes adsorption of the key intermediate COOH* at the Cu site. This permits CO&#8208;selective catalytic mechanisms and thus advances our understanding of the interplay between structure and activity toward electrochemical CO2 reduction using molecular catalysts.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Potential for the Application of Peanut Shells as a Reducer in the Process of Metal Recovery from Metallurgical Slags</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16219261</link>

                Copper production technology is a complex process consisting of many stages. The combination of pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical stages, on the one hand, complicates production while, on the other hand, allowing for a relatively selective separation of intermediate or waste materials that can be subjected to the process of recovery of useful components. Materials of this type are characterised by a much higher copper content relative to the ore material. On the other hand, due to the oxide form, reduction processes are used in which coke is mainly applied. Reduction of the unfavourable phenomenon of CO2 emissions, in this case, can be performed through the use of bioreducers, which are characterised by an inert carbon footprint since the generation of carbon dioxides is the same as its absorption at the stage of vegetation and growth. In this paper, the topic of determining the feasibility of using selected bioreducers, such as peanut shells, to verify their suitability in the process of reducing copper oxides as well as the impact on the working components of the laboratory reactor in which the process is carried out are discussed. In this case, raw materials with a composition similar to the that of slags produced at the copper production stage in a flash furnace were tested for reduction. The results referring to reducing lead and copper contents above 88% Pb and 98% Cu indicate the great potential of this type of bioreducer. An additional advantage is the relatively wide availability of peanut resources. The effects of the copper reduction time on the degree of decopperisation performed with a constant reducer addition at 1300 &#176;C were studied in this paper. Following 1 h of the process, the copper content in the slag was 0.78 wt%, while the longer process duration resulted in a copper fraction of 0.19 wt%. Considering lead, its content was 0.33 wt% after the reduction process.</description>

      <title>Energy Price Distortions and Urban Carbon Emission Efficiency: Evidence from China&#8217;s Energy-Intensive Sectors</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16219351</link>

                With a primary focus of achieving carbon neutrality, the energy-intensive industrial sectors (EIIs) contribute to more than half of China&#8217;s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. During the process of China&#8217;s rapid economic development, distorted energy prices gradually became the main obstacle to energy conservation and emission reductions in the EIIs. Therefore, this study focused on determining the mechanisms affecting the energy price distortions of carbon emission efficiency (CEE) in China&#8217;s EIIs. Based on a stochastic frontier analysis, the changing trend of CEE in China&#8217;s EIIs was evaluated. The channels impacting the energy price distortions of CEE were further analyzed by a mediating effect and moderated mediating effect model. The main contributions and findings include the following: energy price distortions have a significant negative impact on CEE by suppressing technological innovations and hindering the restructuring of energy consumption; governmental environmental regulatory policies mitigate their suppressing effect on technological innovations and reduce the preventing effect by improving the energy consumption structure. The results suggest that market-based price reforms and moderate environmental regulation by the government could help to improve CEE in China&#8217;s EIIs. These findings are of great significance for promoting the sustainable development of the energy-intensive industrial sectors and achieving carbon neutrality.</description>

                Abstract Background As a significant contributor to secondary energy production, the power generation industry has a considerable reliance on fossil fuels. It is a significant source of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, making it a key target for emission reduction in environmental protection. This study is focused on the power generation industry in Anhui Province, China. The LMDI decomposition model and the LEAP model are employed to establish five emission reduction scenarios, which were used to forecast future trends in carbon dioxide and air pollutant emissions in the power generation sector from 2022 to 2035. Results The results indicate that the implementation of comprehensive measures for the promotion of washed coal technology, improvements in thermal power efficiency, and the substitution of clean energy, carbon dioxide, and atmospheric pollutants will reach their peak in 2027, achieving the most optimal emission reduction effects. The analysis of the synergistic emission reduction effects demonstrates that the implementation of comprehensive measures yields the most optimal reduction in carbon dioxide and atmospheric pollutants. Furthermore, the comprehensive scenario exhibits a considerable emission reduction contribution rate. Conclusions For the power generation industry in Anhui Province, the simultaneous implementation of three emission reduction measures represents the optimal path for synergistic improvement in pollution reduction and carbon reduction. These measures provide policy recommendations for the power generation industry in other regions seeking to achieve pollution and carbon reduction.</description>

                Low-value care is common in intensive care units (ICUs), unnecessarily exposing patients to risks and harms, incuring costs to the patient and healthcare system, and contributing to healthcare's carbon footprint. We aimed to identify, collate, and summarise published evidence on the impact of interventions to reduce low-value care in ICUs. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception to 22 September 2023 for evaluations of interventions aiming to reduce low-value care, supplemented by reference lists and recently published articles. We recorded impacts on the low-value target, health outcomes, resource use, cost, and the environment. From 1155 studies screened, 32 eligible studies were identified evaluating interventions to reduce: routine blood testing (n = 13), routine chest X-rays (n = 10), and other types (or multiple types) of low-value care (n = 9). All but 3 of the interventions found reductions in the immediate low-value care target (usually the primary outcome). Although the small sample size of most included studies, limited their ability to detect impacts on other outcomes, many interventions were also associated with improved health outcomes and financial savings. The only study that reported environmental impacts found the intervention was associated with reduced carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) emissions. Interventions to reduce low-value care in ICUs may have important health, financial, and environmental co-benefits. Further research may inform wider scale-up and sustainability of successful strategies to decrease low-value healthcare. More empirical evidence on potential environmental benefits may inform policies to lower healthcare's carbon footprint.</description>

                As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, international cooperation and effective policy tools are crucial for reducing carbon emissions and achieving a sustainable future. This study uses a game-theoretical approach to investigate the negotiations between countries with high and low carbon dioxide emissions, with the goal of achieving zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. By fostering collaboration and understanding among nations, game theory provides a robust framework for addressing the complexities of global climate policy. Game theory provides a mathematical framework to model strategic behaviors in climate negotiations between high and low carbon dioxide-emitting countries. By analyzing the payoff functions, the Nash equilibrium strategies for emission reduction efforts are derived. The introduction of a carbon tax increases the marginal cost of emissions, leading to higher equilibrium efforts by both country groups. Simulation results indicate a significant increase in emission reductions with the tax, demonstrating the tax&#8217;s effectiveness in incentivizing climate action and contributing to global mitigation efforts. This result highlights the potential economic benefits of carbon taxation, including innovation incentives and reduced emissions, which can drive sustainable economic growth and job creation. However, the study also acknowledges potential costs, such as impacts on economic competitiveness and distributional fairness, which must be carefully considered and addressed in policy design. This research offers valuable insights for policymakers, highlighting the importance of crafting carbon tax policies that maximize environmental benefits while minimizing adverse economic and social effects. By balancing these considerations, policymakers can develop more effective strategies that support both environmental sustainability and economic resilience.</description>

                Climate change is a global concern driven by greenhouse gas emissions. Bangladesh, being densely populated and a significant carbon emitter, must urgently reduce its &#8220;carbon-dioxide emissions&#8221;. The primary objectives of this research are to meticulously examine the impact of green growth, non-renewable energy, renewable energy, and technological innovations on carbon dioxide emissions in Bangladesh from 1990 to 2020, with the goal of informing policies for effective and sustainable climate change mitigation in Bangladesh. The analysis using advanced econometric methods, including autoregressive distributed lag, fully modified ordinary least squares, and canonical cointegration regression, reveals that green growth and technological innovations have adverse long-term but positive short-term effects on carbon emissions in Bangladesh. Additionally, it is noteworthy that both non-renewable and renewable energy sources significantly contribute to long-term and short-term carbon emissions. The study confirms the Environmental Kuznets Curve, showing a &#8220;&#8745;&#8221; shaped relationship between green development and carbon emissions. Policymakers should prioritize green growth, incentivize technological innovation, promote sustainable economic practices, and implement comprehensive energy transition strategies. The insights from this study inform policy formulation to address the complex relationships between green growth, energy sources, and carbon-dioxide emissions for sustainable climate change mitigation in Bangladesh. Bangladesh&#8217;s efforts contribute to global emission reduction and foster a resilient future.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Effect of Crystal Facet of Derived&#8208;Copper Catalysts on the Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide under Unified Mass Transport Condition</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202415590</link>
      <description>Zi-Hao Zhao, Dan Ren, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403790287

                Altering the physical structure and chemical property of copper, i.e., particle size, surface morphology, composition or crystal facet, has been demonstrated to be effective in steering the selectivity of products in electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. However, these modifications generally result in the change of active surface area, leading to differences in the geometric current density and local pH, which are also demonstrated to be the key factors for observed selectivity change. In this work, we deconvolute the effect of mass transport and local pH from the effect of crystal facet by investigating five copper&#8208;based catalysts with identical roughness factors for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in an H&#8208;cell. Interestingly, CuO&#8208;derived catalyst stands out as the best catalyst for C&#8208;C coupling. At &#8208;1.07 V vs. RHE, the faradaic efficiency of C2+ product reaches 44.3%, with a partial current density of &#8208;10.8 mA cm&#8208;2. Electrochemical adsorption of *OH reveals that the C2+ product selectivity of derived&#8208;copper catalysts correlates positively with the ratio of Cu(100)/Cu(110) of five catalysts. Additionally, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the percentage of low&#8208;frequency band linear CO (LFB&#8208;CO), which is attributed to the adsorbed *CO on Cu(100) facet, increases with the C&#8208;C coupling efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Present Net Impact Value for the Atmospheric Emission of Forest Carbon from Harvested Wood Products</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s10666-024-10009-7</link>

                Abstract With emerging issues of global climate change, it is clear that there is value in controlling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Managing the release or uptake of carbon by forests is an important opportunity to yield reductions in atmospheric CO 2 , and this includes managing the amount of harvested forest carbon that is stored in harvested wood products (HWP). To evaluate the contribution of forest carbon to climate change, we need to evaluate how much carbon is released to the atmosphere, when it is released, how long the released C remains in the atmosphere, and our preference for the timing and amplitude of climate change. When forest is harvested, the subsequent amount of carbon in the atmosphere depends on the processes and efficiency of harvest, the life times of the forest products, and the treatment of forest products at the end of their useful lifetime. This paper assembles extensive US data on the fractions of forest carbon that are released to the atmosphere during the processing of a forest harvest and the production and life expectancy of harvested wood products (HWP). Using a model of the global carbon cycle and an illustrated treatment of time preference, we calculate the relative cost of different forest management scenarios in terms of the ton years of CO 2 in the atmosphere. We show that delaying the emission of one ton of C as CO 2 for 1 year yields a reduction of 41.74 ton years of carbon in the atmosphere when integrated to infinite time and using a low time preference of 1% per year. Alternate scenarios of forest harvest and product management can be compared against this scenario to compare their relative impact on global climate change.</description>

      <title>Impact of Carbon Tax on Renewable Energy Development and Environmental&#8211;Economic Synergies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17215347</link>
      <description>Keying Feng, Jing Wang, Yu Zhuo, Lili Jiao, Bowen Wang, Zhi Liu, Energies. 17(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403836366

                Global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions has become a worldwide environmental problem, posing a great threat to human survival. As the world&#8217;s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, China has pledged to reach peak carbon emissions by no later than 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. It is found that a carbon tax is a powerful incentive to reduce carbon emissions and promote an energy revolution, but it may have negative socio-economic impacts. Therefore, based on China&#8217;s 2020 input&#8211;output table, this paper systematically investigates the impacts of a carbon tax on China&#8217;s economy, carbon emissions, and energy by applying a computable general equilibrium model to determine the ideal equilibrium between socio-economic and environmental objectives. Based on energy use characteristics, we subdivided the energy sector into five major sectors: coal, oil, natural gas, thermal power generation, and clean power. The results show that when the carbon emission reduction target is less than 15%, that is, when the equilibrium carbon tax price is less than 54 yuan/ton, the implementation of a carbon tax policy can significantly reduce carbon emission and fossil fuel energy consumption, while only slightly reducing economic growth rate, and can achieve the double dividend of environment and economy. Moreover, because the reduction of coal consumption has the greatest impact on reducing carbon emissions, the ad valorem tax rate on coal after the carbon tax is imposed is the highest because coal has the highest carbon emission coefficient among fossil fuels. In addition, as an emerging clean energy source, hydrogen energy is the ideal energy storage medium for achieving clean power generation in power systems. If hydrogen energy can be vigorously developed, it is expected to greatly accelerate the deep decarbonization of power, industry, transportation, construction, and other fields.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation for Urban Tree Image Classification Based on the Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.61173/9wjdn184</link>
      <description>Ruijing Shi, Science and Technology of Engineering Chemistry and Environmental Protection. 1(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403873896

                As urban areas continue to emerge as significant contributors to global carbon emissions, the classification of urban street trees has gained increasing importance in carbon sequestration research. By precisely identifying and categorizing different tree species, the carbon absorption capabilities of urban vegetation can be evaluated more accurately. This understanding is essential for addressing the growing environmental challenges posed by carbon emissions, as urban trees play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide and mitigating the effects of climate change. In this study, a Feature Distillation Based on Diffusion Model (FDBD) framework was proposed, utilizing state-of-the-art image classification technology to enhance the accuracy of urban tree species identification. The framework utilized knowledge distillation, a process where a smaller, more efficient &#8220;student&#8221; model is trained to mimic the performance of a larger, more complex &#8220;teacher&#8221; model, significantly reducing computational demands while maintaining high accuracy. The model&#8217;s effectiveness has been validated through combination experiments with a selected backbone model, achieving promising results. This approach not only enhances the understanding of urban trees&#8217; carbon sequestration potential but also provides crucial insights for policymakers. By facilitating precise tree classification, it empowers urban planners to implement more informed and targeted strategies for carbon reduction, ultimately promoting more sustainable urban environments.</description>

                This study analyzes the variability of carbon dioxide emissions across Asia, revealing that China, India, and Indonesia are the primary contributors with extremely high average emissions and standard deviations. The GSTAR(3;1,1,1) model has been shown to be optimal for forecasting future emissions, based on lower RMSE and MAPE values. Ordinary Kriging analysis using the isotropic spherical semivariogram model provides the most accurate predictions for unobserved areas, with contour maps indicating that the northeastern region of Asia will continue to face high emission concentrations until 2027. While countries such as Brunei and Armenia have managed to keep emission levels low, the instability of emission trends across Asia underscores the need for emission reduction strategies tailored to the specific context of each country.</description>

      <title>Estimating Carbon Dioxide Emissions in Two California Cities Using Bayesian Inversion and Satellite Measurements</title>

                Abstract NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatories (OCO&#8208;2 and OCO&#8208;3) provide measurements of column&#8208;averaged carbon dioxide concentrations (XCO 2 ) with sufficient spatial resolution and precision to constrain bottom&#8208;up estimates of CO 2 fluxes at regional scales. We use Bayesian inversion methods assimilating satellite retrievals to improve estimates of CO 2 fluxes in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) which surrounds Los Angeles, and in the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin (SFBA). We study 2020 to understand the impact of the COVID&#8208;19 lockdowns and an active wildfire season. Our results indicated that a 50% (30%) reduction in CO 2 emissions relative to 2015 during the COVID&#8208;19 lockdown period was consistent with OCO measurements for SFBA (SoCAB). We find that posterior wildfire emissions differed significantly from the prior at the scale of individual wildfires, though with large uncertainties, and that wildfire emissions in SFBA are significant, attributing 72% of the region's CO 2 emissions during August 2020 to wildfires.</description>

                The electrochemical reduction of riboflavin (vitamin B2) in a dimethyl sulfoxide solvent was examined under a CO2 atmosphere and compared with results under an argon atmosphere. Variable-scan-rate cyclic voltammetry combined with controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) and analysis by UV&#8211;vis and EPR spectroscopies provided insights into the nature of interactions of reduced flavins with dissolved CO2. Reductive exhaustive CPE experiments under CO2 indicated an overall two-electron stoichiometry, compared to one-electron reduction under an argon atmosphere, due to the lowering of the formal one-electron reduction potential of the flavin radical anion to form the dianion, which can be rationalized by riboflavin&#8211;CO2 molecular interactions. UV&#8211;vis spectroscopic measurements confirmed complete chemical reversibility of the redox transformations over extended time scales. Digital simulation modeling of the voltammetric data enabled extraction of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for the proposed mechanism, comprising multiple proton-coupled electron transfer steps, diamagnetic anions, radical anions, and neutral radical intermediates enroute to the fully reduced state, as well as evidence of a long-lived solution phase complex of the reduced riboflavin with CO2.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c08499</link>

                Developing efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction into value-added products is crucial for a green economy. Inspired by the recent experimental synthesis of biphenylene (BPH) and the excellent catalytic activity of copper dispersed on two-dimensional (2D) materials, we chose to systematically investigate the pristine, defective, and Cu-decorated BPH for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to value-added hydrocarbons. It is observed that the CO2 molecules bind weakly to the pristine BPH, indicating their chemical inertness. Carbon single-vacancy defects facilitate CO2 adsorption with a strong binding energy (Eb) of &#8722;3.23 eV, detrimental to the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) mechanism. We have further investigated the binding energy and kinetic stability of Cu-decorated BPH as a single-atom-catalyst (SAC). The molecular dynamics simulations confirm the kinetic stability, revealing that the Cu-atom avoids agglomeration under low metal dispersal conditions. The CO2 molecule gets adsorbed horizontally on the Cu-BPH surface with a &#916;Eb of &#8722;0.52 eV. The CRR mechanism is investigated using two pathways beginning with two different initial states, formate (*OCOH) and carboxylic (*COOH). The formate pathway confirms the conversion of *OCOH to *HCOOH with the rate-limiting potential (UL) of 0.39 eV for the production of HCOOH, while for the carboxylic pathway, the conversion of *COH to *CHOH has a UL of 0.32 eV, eventually producing CH3OH. Our findings highlight the role of Cu-BPH as an efficient SAC for CO2 catalytic activity to C1 products, as compared to the state-of-the-art Cu, and holds promise as an electrocatalyst for CRR.</description>

                ABSTRACT The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (eCO 2 RR) is a promising technology for synthesizing value&#8208;added products required in the transition towards a more circular and renewable&#8208;based economy. In this context, the electrochemical production of formic acid has the potential to become economically competitive to energy&#8208;demanding conventional synthetic methods, thereby presenting a sustainable alternative. However, to enhance energy efficiency and selectivity toward the targeted product significant technological improvements in key components (e.g., electrodes, catalysts, electrolytes, membranes, cells, solvents) are required. Over recent years, our research has focused on understanding the influence of catalyst, gas diffusion electrode (GDE) architecture and performance, and cell design in the eCO 2 RR to formic acid. This perspective article provides an overview of the current status of these specific components, as well as our insights and those of other researchers, regarding potential future investigations and applications.</description>

                Abstract Both the physicochemical properties of catalytic material and the structure of loaded catalyst layer (CL) on gas diffusion electrode (GDE) are of crucial importance in determining the conversion efficiency and product selectivity of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). However, the highly reducing reaction condition of CO 2 RR will lead to the uncontrollable structural and compositional changes of catalysts, making it difficult to tailor surface properties and microstructure of the real active species for favored products. Herein, the interlayer microenvironment of copper&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) is rationally tuned by a facile ink solvent engineering, which affects both the surface characters and microstructure of CL on GDE, leading to distinct catalytic activity and product selectivity. According to series of in situ and ex situ techniques, the appropriate surface wettability and thickness of porous CL are found to play critical roles in controlling the local CO 2 concentration and water dissociation steps that are key for hydrogenation during CO 2 RR, leading to a high Faradaic efficiency of 75.3% for C 2+ products and a partial current density of 275 mA cm &#8722;2 at &#8722;0.8 V versus RHE. This work provides insights into rational design of efficient electrocatalysts toward CO 2 RR for multi&#8208;carbon generation.</description>

                This 42nd volume of the International Journal of Sustainable Energy Planning and Management includes two articles from the 2023 Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environmental Systems (SDEWES) conference series as well as two ordinary articles. The two first articles establish links between the energy systems analysis model EnergyPLAN and respectively the Quintel Energy Transition Model (ETM) and urban building energy modelling to form more comprehensive modelling environments. Third, an article addresses energy systems modelling from a more spatial perspective, with the presentation of the ODHeatMap tool to model the spatial characteristics of heat demand particularly in areas where optimal energy planning data may not be available. Lastly, Vietnam&#8217;s economy and energy demand is increasing rapidly, and, in this issue, analyses are presented regarding how ambitions measures in renewable energy utilization and energy efficiency improvements have to beer under different scenarios, for Vietnam to reach its carbon dioxide emission reduction goal.</description>

      <title>The Promoting Effect of Green Bonds on Reducing Carbon Emission Intensity Through Energy Structure Transition</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16219318</link>

                Climate change poses a significant threat to the sustainable development of all countries. The transition to low-carbon energy sources is a crucial strategy for reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change. We investigate the mediating role of clean energy consumption (EC) and fossil energy supply (ES) on the promoting of carbon emission intensity per unit of GDP (CO2/GDP) reduction by green bonds (GBs). We develop a mediating model to analyze how GB influences CO2/GDP reduction through EC and ES, utilizing panel data from 13 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu province spanning the years 2007 to 2021. Additionally, we assess the model&#8217;s reliability through endogeneity and robustness tests. We find that GBs contribute to reducing CO2/GDP by facilitating the structural transition of energy supply and consumption. Furthermore, the development of GBs enhance the consumption of clean energy and plays a direct role in advancing the transition in structure of both energy supply and energy consumption. Notably, we observe heterogeneity in the effectiveness of GBs on CO2/GDP reduction across different regions. Therefore, it is imperative for the government to actively promote the development of GBs to achieve sustainable economic growth. Furthermore, both financial and energy policies should be tailored to align with the specific energy structures of various regions.</description>

                TThis works proposes modifications to the values of input parameters in widely accepted semi-analytical models of thermodynamic properties of hydrogen and its binary mixtures to improve their prediction accuracy. The modifications include characterization parameters for the Peng and Robinson Equation of State (PR-EoS), the Jossi-Stiel-Thodos (JST)/Lohrenz-Bray-Clark (LBC) viscosity correlation, and the Chung-Lee-Starling (CLS) thermal conductivity correlation, applicable to pure hydrogen and its binary mixtures containing methane, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The changes preserve the mathematical structure of the models and ensure their compatibility with existing commercial packages. We consider temperatures ranging from 90 K (triple point of methane) to 1000 K, and pressures ranging from atmospheric up to 100 MPa. The revised characterization parameters of hydrogen lead to a reduction in the Absolute Average Deviation (AAD) of the PR-EoS calculation for hydrogen density from 2.76% (with a maximum of 8.05%) down to 0.182% (with a maximum of 1.9%). For the JST/LBC viscosity correlation, the AAD decreases from 11.82% (with a maximum of 54.3%) to 4.08% (with a maximum of 13%). Regarding thermal conductivity, the adjustments for the CLS correlation results in the AAD decreasing from 36% (with a maximum of 44%) to 2.14\% (with a maximum of 12.1%). Binary interaction parameters for gaseous mixtures containing hydrogen and phase equilibria calculation are also proposed. Finally, we investigage optimal mixing rules parameters for viscosity and thermal conductivity of mixtures for more accurate predictions of mixtures? transport properties.</description>

      <title>Application of magnesium-containing fertilizers by priming method for regulation of physiological processes in winter wheat</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.32634/0869-8155-2024-387-10-122-127</link>
      <description>Dmitry Zakharov, &#1045;. &#1042;. &#1057;&#1090;&#1077;&#1087;&#1072;&#1085;&#1086;&#1074;&#1072;, I. A. Ivanochkin, Agrarian science. 1(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403767866

                The studing the efficiency of new magnesium-containing fertilizer &#8220;AktiMax&#8221; use for priming soft winter wheat seeds of the &#8220;Skipetr&#8221; variety. The effect of the fertilizer is compared with the negative (no fertilizer) and positive (&#8220;Novosil&#8221;) controls. During the study, the optimal concentration 2.6 ml/l of the solution for processing by the selected method is found, which is equivalent to 20% of the recommended by the manufacturer (13 ml/l). At treating with a solution of this concentration, a slight decrease in seed germination is observed, and growth parameter records taken after 7 days showed an increase in leaf length by 15&#8211;20%. A slight decrease in the number of roots (by 10%) and branching of the root system is observed, which is presumably due to the availability of the fertilizer components. The effect fertilizer on the photosynthetic apparatus, carbon dioxide assimilation and transpiration rate when use in a range of concentrations is studied. On average, the transpiration activity increased by 2 times in the variant with the working concentration and by 1.8 times in the variant with one fifth of the working concentration. A slight increase in the efficiency of non-photochemical fluorescence quenching is revealed in plants at the &#8220;AktiMax&#8221; application. The efficiency of seed priming method use to stimulate the rate of winter wheat development is demonstrated that leads to reduction of unfavorable outcomes risks.</description>

                Process simulation was integrated with life cycle assessment to evaluate process efficiency and environmental impact of the production of manganese ferroalloys for various production modes and different ore mineralogies. Utilizing HSC Sim, the model was designed to evaluate the production process with or without a pretreatment step, where results for simulated cases using a four-zone ferromanganese furnace model were exported to openLCA for a complete life cycle assessment. Two main production scenarios were simulated: a closed ferromanganese furnace running on the duplex method and an open furnace running on the discard slag approach. The closed furnace scenario achieved a 17.5% reduction in energy consumption and a 16.2% decrease in direct CO2 emissions with CO-rich off-gas pretreatment. The open furnace scenario showed an 11.2% reduction in energy consumption with thermal solar energy pretreatment but no change in CO2 emissions.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Visible Light for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Conversion: The Role of Highly Reduced Phosphomolybdate Crystals as Powerful Photocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.4c03810</link>

                Heterogeneous photocatalysts, characterized by well-defined atomic structures and the capacity for rapid, directional electron transfer, are pivotal in the exploration and development of highly efficient systems for visible-light-driven diluted CO2 reduction. Herein, we constructed highly reduced phosphomolybdates crystalline materials 1&#8211;3 to help this process, with the formula of [Co2(C8N3H7)4][Co2(C8N3H7)4(H2O)2][Co(H7P4Mo6O31)2]&#183;8H2O (1), [Ni2(C8N3H7)4(H2O)2][Ni2(C8N3H7)4][Ni(H2O)4][Ni(H6P4Mo6O31)2]&#183;3H2O&#183;2C2H5OH (2), and [Zn2(C8N3H7)2][Zn2(C8N3H7)4][Zn2(C8N3H7)2(H2O)2][Zn(H5P4Mo6O31)2] (3) [C8N3H7 = 2-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)pyridine]. Specifically, catalyst 1 demonstrated a CO production rate of 3276.4 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 in an environment with 20% CO2 concentration, and an impressively elevated rate of 10740.3 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 in a pure CO2 atmosphere. Steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed that the directional migration of photoelectrons from the Ru complexes to the catalyst was instrumental in enhancing the catalytic activity. This study provides valuable insights into the rational operation of low-concentration CO2 conversion treatment and the design and synthesis of photocatalysts.</description>

                Ambient urea synthesis via C&#8211;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate reduction offers an attractive alternative to the Bosch-Meiser route, but it is hindered by the lack of efficient catalysts. Herein, we report that Fe-doped InOOH nanosheets effectively catalyze the coreduction of CO2 and nitrate, giving a high Faradaic Efficiency of 26.9%, a yield rate of 980.6 &#956;g h&#8211;1 mgcat.&#8211;1, and a good durability. Theoretical calculations further elucidate that iron dopants can tailor the reactivity of the In site, facilitating the hydrogenation of the key *CO2NH2 intermediate and suppressing the hydrogen production with a higher energy barrier.</description>

      <title>Hemoglobin value prediction with bayesian optimization assisted machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.33769/aupse.1462331</link>
      <description>Koray A&#231;&#305;c&#305;, Communications Faculty of Sciences University of Ankara Series A2-A3 Physical Sciences and Engineering. 66(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403825000

                This study presents a framework for predicting hemoglobin (Hb) levels utilizing Bayesian optimization-assisted machine learning models, incorporating both time-domain and frequency-domain features derived from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. Hemoglobin, a crucial protein for oxygen and carbon dioxide transport in the blood, has levels that indicate various health conditions, including anemia and diseases affecting red blood cell production. Traditional methods for measuring Hb levels are invasive, posing potential risks and discomfort. To address this, a dataset comprising PPG signals, along with demographic data (gender and age), was analyzed to predict Hb levels accurately. Our models employ support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural networks (ANNs), classification and regression trees (CART), and ensembles of trees (EoT) optimized through Bayesian optimization algorithm. The results demonstrated that incorporating age and gender as features significantly improved model performance, highlighting their importance in Hb level prediction. Among the tested models, ANN provided the best results, involving normalized raw signals, feature selection, and reduction methods. The model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 1.508, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.228, and R-squared (R&#178;) of 0.226. This study's findings contribute to the growing body of research on non-invasive hemoglobin prediction, offering a potential tool for healthcare professionals and patients for convenient and risk-free Hb level monitoring.</description>

      <title>Reducing the climate impact of food choices with comparable nutritional quality: a randomised trial</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckae144.1427</link>

                Abstract Background Diets largely contribute to the global disease burden, and a third of global warming emissions. We assessed the climate footprint reduction effect of framing the climate impact of diets as a collective action problem (social dilemma), compared or in combination with a reflective intervention (information) and a choice architecture intervention (nudge). Interactions with lifestyle factors were examined. Methods A randomised 2X2X2 between-subjects online experiment was conducted among university students &#8805;18 years, enrolled at a Swiss university, and not following a medically prescribed diet. The outcome was the mean climate footprint of food choices (in kg CO2-eq), based on a Life Cycle Assessment. Meals varied in climate footprints while adhering to the Swiss dietary guidelines. Results This analysis focused on the subset of meat eaters (n = 1691). Median age was 24 years, and 59.85% (n = 1012) were female. Seven intervention groups resulted in significantly lower climate footprints compared to the control. The social dilemma plus a nudge menu was the most effective behavioural intervention leading to 20.20% footprint reduction (b = -1.20 kg CO2-eq) compared to the control group (Mcontrol=5.94, SDcontrol=2.76; Mdilemma+nudge=4.74, SDdilemma+nudge=2.09 t(436) = -5.10, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Lifestyle factors linked to a higher climate footprint of food choices included adhering to a low-calorie diet (b = 1.21 kg CO2-eq, p &amp;lt; 0.05), or a muscle gain diet (b = 2.12 kg CO2-eq p &amp;lt; 0.05) and practising physical activities (PA) while adhering to a muscle-gain diet (Aerobic/Cardio: 3.82 kg CO2-eq, p &amp;lt; 0.05; Muscle-strengthening: 2.24 kg CO2-eq, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions The combination of reflective collective action communication and menu nudges is an effective strategy to mitigate the climate footprint of food choices in education institutions. Adherence to a muscle-gain diet was identified as a critical but manageable lifestyle factor linked to a higher climate footprint. Key messages &#8226; The dilemma plus a nudge was the most effective to reduce the climate footprint of food choices. &#8226; This combined intervention can manage the high climate footprints linked to lifestyle factors.</description>

                The overuse of fossil fuels has resulted in massive CO2 emissions, causing global environmental problems. Renewable energy-driven electrocatalysis, which can convert CO2 into fuels and chemicals, is considered an emerging technology for carbon resource recycling. Cu-based catalysts sputtered on hydrophobic carbon paper and a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane were comparatively investigated, while the effect of the thickness of the Cu sputtering layer on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction performance was investigated. Additionally, the effect of substrate properties on the distribution and morphology of sputtered Cu metal was investigated by SEM and XRD. With carbon paper as the substrate, the highest FEC2+ achieved was 70% at 200 mA/cm2, while the maximum value of FEC2+ on the Cu/PTFE electrode was realized with a Cu thickness of 400 nm (72%). Additionally, the PTFE substrate demonstrated a better inhibiting effect on HER, with a lower FEH2 and high FEC2+ over different applied current densities.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Calendar Events upon Urban Vehicle Behaviour and Emissions Using Telematics Data</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/smartcities7060120</link>

                Employing vehicle telematics data, this study investigates the transport environment across urban and major road networks during a two-week period encompassing the Easter holidays, considered as a case study. The analysis spans four distinct years: 2016, 2018, 2021, and 2022. Geospatial and Temporal Mapping captured the dependencies of vehicle speed, acceleration, vehicle-specific power (VSP), and emission factors (EFs) for air pollutants (CO2 and NOx) on the studied calendar period. The results showed that during the Easter holiday, the median vehicle speeds exceeded annual averages by roughly 5%, indicating a clear deviation from regular traffic patterns. This deviation was particularly stark during the 2021 lockdown, with a significant drop in vehicle presence, leading to less congestion and thus higher speeds and vehicle acceleration. The emissions analyses revealed that individual cars emit higher levels of CO2 and NOx during Easter. Specifically, the median values of CO2 EF and NOx EF were 9% and 11% higher than the annual norm. When combined with road occupancy data, the results demonstrate that the Easter holidays in 2022 had a variable impact on NOx and CO2 emissions, with significant reductions on major roads during weekday rush hours (15&#8211;25%) but slight increases on urban roads during weekend periods.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Urban Breathability: Investigating the Synergistic Mitigation of PM2.5 and CO2 by Community Park Green Space in the Built Environment Using Simulation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14113407</link>

                Reducing carbon emissions and controlling air pollution is a dual challenge for China in addressing climate change. Analyzing the synergistic relationship between PM2.5 and CO2 in urban green spaces has become an important part of promoting pollution control. The study investigated the influence and synergistic relationship between the spatial pattern of community parks on PM2.5 and CO2 in Xi&#8217;an City, Shaanxi Province, through practical measurement and ENVI-met/Open Studio simulation calculations. The results showed that: (1) Within the sphere of influence, community parks exhibit a positive synergy varying with distance, peaking at 400 m and declining as 300 m &gt; 500 m &gt; 200 m &gt; 100 m. (2) The green space rate, total edge (TE), and mean patch shape index (SHAPE_MN) positively influence the synergistic mitigation of PM2.5 and CO2, with a defined maximum impact boundary. The strongest synergistic reduction of PM2.5 and CO2 occurs at a green space rate of 85%, TE1200, and SHAPE1.2, with optimal influence boundaries of 300 m, 200 m, and 100 m, respectively. This conclusion demonstrates the key role of green space in community parks in the synergistic abatement and provides a scientific basis and practical guidance for the planning and design of urban green space under the goal of &#8220;dual-carbon&#8221;.</description>

The ventilation period required for complete CO 2 fixation ( t EOF ) was estimated from the test results of each column. The maximum amount of CO 2 captured per gram of dry soil (( m CO2 ) max ) was determined based on the inflow and outflow of CO 2 for each specimen. The investigation into the effects of soil density, specimen height, CO 2 gas concentration, and flow rate on t EOF and ( m CO2 ) max revealed that t EOF increased with higher dry density ( &#961; d ) or specimen height ( H ), as a denser and larger specimen consumed more CO 2 gas. Conversely, t EOF decreased with a higher CO 2 gas concentration ( C ) or flow volume ( Q ) because a low C or Q resulted in an insufficient CO 2 gas supply to match the consumption induced by the reaction. Lower C and Q tended to yield higher ( m CO2 ) max , whereas higher &#961; d and H resulted in higher ( m CO2 ) max . Furthermore, ( m CO2 ) max increased with t EOF , with a slight reduction in pH after neutralization with increased t EOF . This phenomenon was attributed to the longer ventilation period enabling more Ca to react with the CO 2 gas and maintain the equilibrium state of the reaction. Finally, the evaluation of the CO 2 consumption rate ( CSR ) for each column specimen revealed that a higher C and Q resulted in a lower CSR , whereas a higher H resulted in a higher CSR . Additionally, a longer t EOF was associated with a higher CSR , although some variation was observed.</description>

                Abstract Field A, the largest cluster in Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), faced a significant challenge with a high overall artificial lift failure index, surpassing industry standards at 28% in 2020. The primary contributors to this index were beam pump (BP) wells. In response, a comprehensive workshop was conducted involving all stakeholders to address the issue of artificial lift failures. Field A's artificial lift fail-less strategy was formulated and implemented as a result of this workshop. A long stroke unit (LSU) was deployed in Field A as a result of the persistently high failure rates for conventional beam pump units (BP), which exceeded 32% in 2020. In an effort to mitigate these challenges, a series of successful trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of LSU, which led to the conversion of 70 conventional BP units to LSUs between 2020 and 2023. The results obtained from the deployment of LSU in Field A showcased significantly improved run life, indicated by a reduction in failure index. This increase in reliability contributed to the avoidance of subsurface deferments due to less failures and tripping, resulting in estimated additional production of 320 bbl/d. Additionally, LSUs reduced the number of well interventions, primarily due to fewer failures. It resulted in a substantial improvement in the life cycle of the wells, saving $2.94 million annually. As a result of the deployment of LSUs, power savings were also achieved. In comparison to conventional BP units, LSU demonstrated a remarkable 40% reduction in power consumption, resulting in a significant decrease in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 4575 tCO2e since LSUs deployment. This successful implementation not only addressed high failure rates but also enhanced system reliability, reduced corrective maintenance, lowered power consumption, and effectively reduced oil deferment. This abstract outlines these positive outcomes, the challenges faced during implementation, and strategies used to overcome them. Additionally, it presents a roadmap for deploying LSUs across Field &#8216;A, with plans for over 150 LSUs installation in the next five years. The study provides valuable insights for the oil and gas industry, showcasing the potential for wide adoption of LSUs to enhance performance in similar fields.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Artificial Neural Network Ensembles for Ship Design Optimization to Reduce Added Wave Resistance and CO2 Emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17215326</link>
      <description>Tomasz Cepowski, Energies. 17(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403836845

                Increased maritime cargo transportation has necessitated stricter management of emissions from ships. The primary source of this pollution is fuel combustion, which is influenced by factors such as a ship&#8217;s added wave resistance. Accurate estimation of this resistance during ship design is crucial for minimizing exhaust emissions. The challenge is that, at the preliminary parametric design stage, only limited geometric data about the ship is available, and the existing methods for estimating added wave resistance cannot be applied. This article presents the application of artificial neural network (ANN) ensembles for estimating added wave resistance based on dimensionless design parameters available at the preliminary design stage, such as the length-to-breadth ratio (L/B), breadth-to-draught ratio (B/T), length-to-draught ratio (L/T), block coefficient (CB), and the Froude number (Fn). Four different ANN ensembles are developed to predict this resistance using both complete sets of design characteristics (i.e., L/B, B/T, CB, and Fn) and incomplete sets, such as L/B, CB, and Fn; B/T, CB, and Fn; and L/T, CB, and Fn. This approach allows for the consideration of CO2 emissions at the parametric design stage when only limited ship dimensions are known. An example in this article demonstrates that minor modifications to typical container ship designs can significantly reduce added wave resistance, resulting in a daily reduction of up to 2.55 tons of CO2 emissions. This reduction is equivalent to the emissions produced by 778 cars per day, highlighting the environmental benefits of optimizing ship design.</description>

      <title>Effects of drought on photosynthetic induction in leaves of different wheat genotypes under dark-to-light transition</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.15421/022471</link>
      <description>A.S. Kedruk, D.A. Kiriziy, &#1054;.&#1054;. &#1057;&#1090;&#1072;&#1089;&#1080;&#1082;, &#1054;. G. Sokolovska-Sergiienko, M.V. Tarasiuk, Regulatory Mechanisms in Biosystems. 15(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403770686

                Adjustment of photosynthetic processes to an increase in irradiance constrains the CO2 assimilation and photosynthetic carbon gain compared to that which would be obtained if photosynthesis reached its terminal value instantaneously. Acceleration of photosynthesis induction under field conditions of fluctuating light opens up new perspectives for increasing yields. However, there is little information on response of photosynthetic processes to changes in the light under drought conditions. In a pot experiment, we have studied the peculiarities of response of CO2- and H2O-gas exchange parameters in flag leaves of 3 winter wheat genotypes to a transition from dark to bright light under drought conditions, to reveal the features of drought effect on photosynthetic induction processes. The plants were exposed to a 7-day drought (30% FC) during the flowering stage. After that, the watering of the treated plants was restored to the control level (70% FC), which was maintained until the end of the growing season. Induction curves of CO2 assimilation and transpiration of the flag leaves were recorded after keeping them in the darkness for 30 minutes, then the light was turned on. It was revealed that drought impacts the photosynthetic apparatus by reducing its maximum functional intensity as well as by diminishing its ability to respond to changing light conditions. Specifically, drought slows the rate of gas exchange increase during transitions from dark to light. High-yielding wheat genotypes, which had higher assimilation rates and stomatal conductance under optimal watering, showed increased sensitivity to drought. The reduction in the CO2 assimilation rate in wheat leaves under drought was primarily due to damage to the photosynthetic apparatus in mesophyll cells, rather than inhibition of stomatal conductance. This conclusion is supported by Ci value calculations, which were highest at the lowest CO2 assimilation rate at the beginning of light exposure and lowest at the highest CO2 assimilation rate when reaching a steady-state plateau. The stronger impact of the drought on the biochemical components of the photosynthetic apparatus than on stomata is also suggested by a decrease in instantaneous water use efficiency (WUEi) during photosynthesis. The genotypic differences in the effects of drought on the dynamics of photosynthetic induction parameters during dark-to-light transitions in wheat leaves suggest the potential of these traits for evaluating breeding material. This could enhance the ecological plasticity of new wheat varieties.</description>

      <title>The effect of firewood combustion cookstove types on indoor air pollution and deforestation in selected rural houses of Ethiopia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1326517</link>
      <description>Miftah Fekadu, Moges Molla, Birhanu Hailu, Frontiers in Environmental Science. 12(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403738433

                Introduction Indoor air pollution occurs in a microenvironment such as residential homes, closed working places, or industries in which people spend a large part of their time. Cooking or baking food in traditional or open three-stone cookstoves by using firewood is the cause for kitchen-related smoke indoor air pollution and deforestation. Modifying traditional firewood cookstoves could reduce the emissions of indoor air pollutants. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of firewood cookstove types on indoor air pollution, emission reduction, and deforestation in selected rural houses of Bure, Ameya, and Dalocha woredas (districts) of Ethiopia. Methods Indoor air pollutants such as carbonmonoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), sulfurdioxide (SO 2 ), and particulate matters (PMs) were measured in three replicates for 3 min. within an average cooking time of 1 h using an automatic gas sensor. The amount of wood was separately measured by using graduated weight balance (0.1 gm). Results and discussion The cooking place was mostly the same room as the sleeping place without a separate kitchen. The improved cookstoves were installed without a chimney (smokeoutlet) and with wider spaces left for a firewood inlet. In improved Injera baking cookstoves, the mean emission of CO was 1004.80 mg/m 3 , 33.00 mg/m 3 , and 53.85 mg/m 3 in Bure, Ameya, and Dalocha woredas, respectively, which were lower than the emissions from open cookstoves. The mean concentration of PM2.5 in open cookstoves in Bure, Ameya, and Dalocha woredaswas 124.50 mg/m 3 , 0.53 mg/m 3 , and 0.04 mg/m 3 , respectively, which are higher than the emission from improved stoves. In Bure woreda households, the CO exposure was above 26 times the permissible limit of WHO standards. Biomass consumption was positively correlated with the moisture content of wood ( p &amp;lt; 0.05). Improved cookstoves reduced indoor air pollution by 13%&#8211;81% and carbon emission and deforestation by 20%&#8211;41% when compared with the open three-stone cookstoves. Indoor air pollutants are risks to health and cause climate change problems. Therefore, awareness should be created on the health effects of firewood smoke indoor air pollution, ventilation of cooking places, and installation of chimneys with improved cookstoves.</description>

      <title>Public Policies for the Energy Efficiency of Buildings in Mexico</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14113437</link>
      <description>Mirna Castro-Bello, Lizbeth G&#243;mez-Mu&#241;oz, Carlos Virgilio Marmolejo-Vega, Cornelio Morales-Morales, Eleazar Felipe Valencia-D&#237;az, Jos&#233; Filiberto Maldonado-Catal&#225;n, Carlos Ramiro Marmolejo Duarte, Buildings. 14(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403876250

                In Latin America, the energy crisis has worsened due to the dependence on energy services and fossil fuel imports from highly industrialized countries at prices established by the international market; this is particularly relevant to the construction industry, which presents a significant deficit in optimal energy consumption. Hence, some governments have established public policies to maximize the efficiency of these services and, at the same time, minimize the carbon footprint. In this research study, we reviewed the public policies, strategies, and incentives for energy efficiency (EE) implementation in the residential sector established by the Mexican government. A scoping review methodology was chosen and implemented in the following steps: 1. Research inquiry identification. 2. Determination of the relevant literature and studies. 3. The literature selection. 4. Data graphing. 5. Results collection, overview, and submission. In this systematic review, we identified five mandatory standards (NOM-008-ENER-2001, NOM-009-ENER-2014, NOM-018-ENER-2011, NOM-020-ENER-2011, and NOM-024-ENER-2012), six optional standards, four strategies (Green Mortgage, Integral Sustainable Improvement in Existing Housing, ECOCASA, and NAMA), and three kinds of incentives (green bonds, credit and interest rates (Green Mortgage, FIDE, and Ecocasa), and taxes (Income Tax Reduction)). As a result of the implementation of the above, as of December 2020, NAMA financed 5106 developers of 38 projects in 15 states; contributed to a reduction of 126,779 tons of CO2; and aided 19,913 people. From 2013 to December 2023, EcoCasa subsidized 71,440 households for a total of 224 projects in 25 states; contributed to a reduction of 2.6 million tons of CO2; aided 285,760 Mexicans; and issued EcoCasa certificates for 3,473,556 m2. The results of the EE indicators in residential buildings showed an increase in the housing unit number as well as an increase in household appliances, with those based on power consumption prevailing. The residential sector ranks third in power consumption in Mexico, consuming an estimated 790 pj, of which 76% corresponds to thermal energy and 24% to electric power. Among countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Mexico has achieved an Energy Transition Index of 62%.</description>

      <title>Modelling the integration of bagasse pyrolysis into sugar mill energy systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.36961/si32448</link>
      <description>Yu Matsueda, Madoc Sheehan, Jonathon Gilberd, Deleted Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403733031

                Pyrolysis degrades biomass under low oxygen conditions to produce an energy-rich gas, bio-oil, and carbon-dense biochar. The resulting bio-oil and gas can be combusted for high energy production, while biochar is a high-value product with potential as a fertiliser and soil amendment product. However, very few studies have been on integrating pyrolysis into the sugar mill energy system. This study aimed to model the integration of bagasse pyrolysis into an energy system based on Victoria Mill. The model was well-validated from previous literature on bagasse pyrolysis and mill system data. The pyrolysis unit&#8217;s operating conditions were optimised for steam production, carbon emission reduction, and product value, resulting in 20% less steam production, 16% reduced CO2 emissions, and 76% higher economic profit than current operations. Full steam production could be maintained by bypassing 30% of the bagasse to the pyrolysis unit and 70% directly to the boiler. This configuration led to 12% reduced CO2 emissions and 32% greater economic profits when compared to the current process. Overall, this research showed that the integration of bagasse pyrolysis into sugar mill energy systems has potentially substantial benefits, and its adoption in sugar milling deserves careful analysis.</description>

      <title>Energy Consumption, Emission, Transportation Sector in Malaysia: Review on Malaysia&#8217;s Road Transport</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.22610/imbr.v16i3s(i)a.4130</link>
      <description>Fatin Farazh Yaacob, Basri Badyalina, Sazlin Suhalmie Mohd Shariff, Mohamad Faizal Ramli, Rabiatul Munirah Alpandi, Information Management and Business Review. 16(3S(I)a)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403827357

                Transportation is a major challenge for energy conservation, with road transport in Malaysia being a significant contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In Malaysia, traditional fossil fuels such as gasoline and diesel dominate the transportation sector, which has become the second-largest source of GHG emissions, accounting for 20% in 2014. This increase in CO2 emissions, driven by rising vehicle ownership and economic growth, underscores the urgent need for effective emission reduction strategies. The rapid growth in road transportation in Malaysia is linked to socioeconomic factors, including rising incomes and urbanization, leading to higher energy consumption and pollution. Data indicates a significant increase in vehicle registrations from 1990 to 2018, with motorcars and motorcycles being the most common. This growth, fueled by subsidies and decentralization, has exacerbated the sector&#8217;s environmental impact. The Green Technology Master Plan Malaysia 2017&#8211;2040 aims to address these issues by setting ambitious targets to enhance renewable energy, improve energy efficiency, and promote eco-friendly fuels. Key strategies include expanding public transportation, increasing the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), and introducing alternative fuels like hydrogen. Malaysia has substantial potential to reduce CO2 emissions through initiatives such as expanding EV infrastructure, promoting natural gas vehicles, and improving public transit. Effective implementation of these strategies can significantly lower the transportation sector&#8217;s carbon footprint, contributing to a more sustainable future.</description>

      <title>Performance and Emission Characteristics of a Diesel Engine Fueled by Biodiesel-Ethanol-Diesel Fuel Blends</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.51141/ijatr.v4i1.27</link>
      <description>Hazir Farouk, International Journal of Advanced Thermofluid Research. 4(1)] 2018. https://openalex.org/W4403799577

                There is growing interest to study the effect of blending various oxygenated additives with diesel or biodiesel fuel on engine performance and emission characteristics. This study aims to analyze the performance and exhaust emission of a four-stroke, four-cylinder diesel engine fueled with biodiesel-ethanol-diesel. Biodiesel was first produced from crude Jatropha oil, and then it was blended with ethanol and fossil diesel in different blend ratios (B10E10D80, B12.5E12.5D75, B15E15D70, B20E20D60 and B25E25D50). The engine performance and emission characteristics were studied at engine speeds ranging from 1200 to 2000 rpm. The results show that the brake specific fuel consumption increases while the brake power decreases as the percentage of biodiesel and ethanol increases in the blend. The exhaust emission analysis shows a reduction in CO2 emission and increase in NOx emission when the biodiesel -to-ethanol ratio increases in the blends, when compared with diesel as a reference fuel.</description>

      <title>Exploring climate stabilisation at different global warming levels in ACCESS-ESM-1.5</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-15-1353-2024</link>
      <description>Andrew D. King, Tilo Ziehn, Matthew A. Chamberlain, Alexander R Borowiak, Josephine R. Brown, Liam Cassidy, Andrea J. Dittus, Michael Grose, Nicola Maher, Seungmok Paik, Sarah E. Perkins&#8208;Kirkpatrick, Aditya Sengupta, Earth System Dynamics. 15(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403886533

                Abstract. Under the Paris Agreement, signatory nations aim to keep global warming well below 2 &#176;C above pre-industrial levels and preferably below 1.5 &#176;C. This implicitly requires achieving net-zero or net-negative greenhouse gas emissions to ensure long-term global temperature stabilisation or reduction. Despite this requirement, there have been few analyses of stabilised climates, and there is a lack of model experiments to address our need for understanding the implications of the Paris Agreement. Here, we describe a new set of experiments using the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator Earth system model (ACCESS-ESM-1.5) that enables the analysis of climate evolution under net-zero emissions, and we present initial results. Seven 1000-year-long simulations were run with global temperatures stabilising at levels in line with the Paris Agreement and at a range of higher global warming levels (GWLs). We provide an overview of the experimental design and use these simulations to demonstrate the consequences of delayed attainment of global net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. We show that there are substantial differences between transient and stabilising climate states and differences in stabilisation between GWLs. As the climate stabilises under net-zero emissions, we identify significant and robust changes in temperature and precipitation patterns including continued Southern Ocean warming and changes in regional precipitation trends. Changes under net-zero emissions differ greatly between regions, including contrasting trajectories of sea ice extent between the Arctic and Antarctic. We also examine the El Ni&#241;o&#8211;Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and find evidence of reduced amplitude and frequency of ENSO events under climate stabilisation relative to projections under transient warming. An analysis at specific GWLs shows that significant regional changes continue for centuries after emission cessation and that these changes are stronger at higher GWLs. Our findings suggest substantial long-term climate changes are possible even under net-zero emission pathways. These simulations are available for use in the community and will hopefully motivate further experiments and analyses based on other Earth system models.</description>

      <title>Interactive Simulation of Nonpharmaceutical Interventions of Airborne Disease Transmission in Office Settings</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph21111413</link>
      <description>Thomas Zimmerman, Neha Sharma, Hakan Bulu, Vanessa Burrowes, David Beymer, Vandana Mukherjee, International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health. 21(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403766483

                The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions to workplace safety and productivity. A browser-based interactive disease transmission simulation was developed to enable managers and individuals (agents) to optimize safe office work activities during pandemic conditions. The application provides a user interface to evaluate the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) policies on airborne disease exposure based on agents&#8217; meeting patterns and room properties. Exposure is empirically calibrated using CO2 as a proxy for viral aerosol dispersion. For the building studied, the major findings are that the cubicles during low occupancy produce unexpectedly high exposure, upgrading meetings to larger rooms reduces total average exposure by 44%, and when all meetings are conducted in large rooms, a 79% exposure reduction is realized.</description>

      <description>Jiaji Zhang, Yu-Ting Lin, Li Wang, Qiankun Wang, Ke Zhu, Shize Yang, Guoqing Guo, Buildings. 14(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403761728

                This study focuses on developing and implementing zero-carbon buildings through the integration of multiple systems to meet China&#8217;s carbon neutrality goals. It emphasizes the significant role of the building sector in carbon emissions and highlights the challenge of increasing energy consumption conflicting with China&#8217;s &#8220;dual carbon&#8221; targets. To address this, the research proposes a comprehensive framework that combines multifunctional envelope structure (MES) systems, photovoltaic power generation, energy storage, direct current (DC) systems, flexible energy management (PEDF), and regional energy stations. This framework integrates different technologies such as phase change materials, radiation cooling, and carbon mineralized cement, aiming to reduce carbon emissions throughout the building&#8217;s lifecycle. The method has been successfully applied in the Yazhou Bay Zero Carbon Post Station project in Sanya, Hainan, with precise calculations of carbon emission reductions. The carbon emission calculations revealed a reduction of 44.13 tons of CO2 annually, totaling 1103.31 tons over 25 years, primarily due to the rooftop photovoltaic systems. It demonstrates that the multi-system integration can reduce carbon emissions and contribute to China&#8217;s broader carbon neutrality goals. This approach, if widely adopted, could accelerate the transition to carbon-neutral buildings in China.</description>

                During the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) on copper catalysts, linear-bonded CO (*COL) is commonly regarded as the key intermediate for the CO-CO coupling step, which leads to the formation of multicarbon products. In this work, we unveil the significant role of bridge-bonded *CO (*COB) as an active species. By combining in situ Raman spectroscopy, gas and liquid chromatography, and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we show that adsorbed *OH domains displace *COL to *COB. The electroreduction of a 12CO+13CO2 cofeed demonstrates that *COB distinctly favors the production of acetate and 1-propanol, while *COL favors ethylene and ethanol formation. This work enhances our understanding of the mechanistic intricacies of eCO(2)RR and suggests new directions for designing operational conditions by modifying the competitive adsorption of surface species, thereby steering the reaction toward specific multicarbon products.</description>

      <title>Persistent deep-water formation in the Nordic Seas during Marine Isotope Stages 5 and 4 notwithstanding changes in Atlantic overturning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-3163</link>

                Abstract. Reductions in the extent and formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and the expansion of southern-sourced waters in the Atlantic Ocean were linked to enhanced marine carbon storage during glacial and stadial periods and are considered a key mechanism explaining late Pleistocene atmospheric CO2 variations on glacial-interglacial and millennial timescales. However, changes in the formation of deep waters in the Nordic Seas, an important source of NADW, and their influence on the geometry and intensity of Atlantic overturning remain poorly understood, especially beyond the last glacial maximum, leaving possible impacts on atmospheric CO2 changes elusive. Here, we present high-resolution Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi B/Ca-based bottom water [CO32-] reconstructions, alongside with complementary C. wuellerstorfi stable oxygen and carbon isotopes and abundance estimates of aragonitic pteropods in marine sediment core PS1243 from the deep Norwegian Sea to investigate past deep-water dynamics in the Nordic Seas and potential impacts on Atlantic overturning and carbon cycling. Our data suggest continuous formation of dense and well-ventilated (high-[CO32-]) deep waters throughout Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5 and 4, alongside a deepening of the aragonite compensation depth by at least 700 m during the MIS 5b-to-4 transition, consistent with sustained Nordic Seas convection. In addition, higher-than-Holocene bottom water [CO32-] during MIS 5e highlight the resilience of Nordic Seas overturning towards a warmer North Atlantic, decreased Arctic sea ice extent and meltwater supply from surrounding ice sheets. A compilation of bottom water [CO32-] records from the Atlantic Ocean indicates that dense waters from the Nordic Seas may have continuously expanded into the intermediate and/or deep (western) North Atlantic via supply of dense water overflows across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge, diminishing the capacity of the North Atlantic to store carbon during MIS 4 and stadial conditions of MIS 5. Our study emphasises differences in the sensitivity of North Atlantic and Nordic Seas overturning dynamics to climate boundary conditions of the last glacial cycle that have implications for the carbon storage capacity of the Atlantic Ocean and its role in atmospheric CO2 variations.</description>

      <title>Innovative Approach in ESP Power Optimization for Large Field</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/221563-ms</link>
      <description>Mulad B. Winarno, M. A. Eissa, Mar&#237;a Flores, M. A. Khalifah, O. L. Isichei, Suleyman Malki, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403821887

                Abstract Electric Submersible Pump (ESP) is very popular artificial lift method to produce at high production rate. However, ESP power consumption is costly and mandate proper optimization to operate at the optimal condition. ESP energy optimization directly improve operational efficiency and reduces lifting cost and greenhouse gas emission. The ESP power optimization is challenging exercise and requires involvement from multiple organizations. The process has to go through excess of possible combinations of surface choke valve positions and pump speed until reaching an optimized setting. Optimization of ESP operations helps operators to meet production target while maximizing the efficiency of the pump operation. However, it cannot be achieved easily, especially where time and resources are scarce. An innovative approach capitalizing the digital-twin model and artificial intelligence technologies to optimize the ESP performance and adhering to the environmental challenges of reducing CO2 emission has been introduced to expedite the optimization process. The new approach automatically utilizes ESP real time data, ESP installation data along with the well model to determine the ESP's optimal WHP and ESP frequency. The modelling will be automatically updated based on real time data and provide predictions of recommended operation frequency and optimum wellhead pressure, which is translated to choke size, to operate the ESP at BEP (Best Efficiency Point) and to maximize production rate and minimize power consumption. The optimization process has been implemented in the field resulting in a significant power consumption saving and CO2 emission reduction. Further gains are also expected from ESP performance, resulting in longer ESP run life and reduce number of workover cost. This paper will share the ESP optimization journey using the advisory tool from obtaining the data, performing the calculations, providing the recommendations, and field implementation of these recommendations. The best practices and lessons learnt were captured as a reference for future ESP power optimization advisory tool enhancement.</description>

      <title>A Microgrid Deployment Framework to Support Drayage Electrification</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2410.01684</link>
      <description>Joseph N. E. Lucero, Ruixiao Sun, Brandon A. Miller, Simona Onori, Vivek A. Sujan, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403851991

                The electrification of heavy-duty commercial vehicles (HDCVs) is pivotal in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution; however, this transition poses significant challenges for the existing electric grid, which is not designed to meet the high electricity demands of HDCVs. This can lead to a less effective reduction in freight transportation's carbon intensity despite significant electrification efforts. Deploying renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaics, alongside energy storage solutions, is essential to address these challenges. This paper examines the current grid limitations and explores the critical role of microgrid deployment, integrating solar and battery energy storage systems, in supporting the electrification of HDCVs. We propose an integrated framework that is designed to enhance regional grid capacity and decrease carbon intensity by identifying viable sites where a microgrid can be deployed and provide estimates for the deployment cost. Furthermore, using this framework, we quantify the maximal impact of microgrid deployment in reducing CO2 emissions when we optimize the use of the available power. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to the region of the Port of Savannah, GA USA.</description>

      <title>Health burden and costs attributed to the carbon footprint of health systems in the European Union</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckae144.021</link>
      <description>Jos&#233; Chen-Xu, M Corda, Orsolya Varga, Susana Viegas, European Journal of Public Health. 34(Supplement_3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403825534

                Abstract Background Health systems have an environmental impact of around 4.6% of global emissions, contributing to aggravating the climate crisis. However, the health impact of the carbon emissions originated by health systems is not regularly assessed. We aim to estimate the health burden and associated costs of the carbon footprint of health systems across the European Union (EU). Methods We calculated DALYs and associated costs based on human health damage factors (DALYs/kg-CO2e) by considering four scenarios. Three scenarios for shared socioeconomic pathways (S1 - high growth, S2 - baseline, and S3 - low growth) represented variations of global society, demographics, and economics until 2100. A fourth scenario (S4) considered the current EU&#8217;s 55% reduction goal of greenhouse gas emissions. The healthcare sector&#8217;s emissions per capita (in CO2-equivalent) in 2019 were extracted from the Lancet Countdown, and population data were retrieved from Eurostat for the same year. Results In the EU, 365,047 DALYs (95%CI: 194,692-535,403) are expected to be caused by health systems&#8217; emissions at baseline (S2). In an S1 scenario, the burden would slightly decrease to 315,374 DALYs (95%CI: 170,355-462,393), whereas a S3 scenario would increase 486,730 DALYs (95%CI: 243,365-681,422). If EU&#8217;s carbon goals are met, the burden could be substantially reduced to 164,271 DALYs (95%CI: 87,611-240,931). The monetisation of DALYs can result in costs amounting to 25.6 billion euros. Conclusions CO2 emissions from health systems are expected to significantly impact human health. It is therefore of the utmost importance to ensure that EU climate policies for healthcare buildings are in line with the Paris Agreement. This will require the implementation of climate mitigation programmes within the health sector and a review of clinical practices at the local level. Key messages &#8226; The carbon footprint of health systems is estimated to significantly impact health, with high economic burden. &#8226; EU climate policies for healthcare buildings and procurement must be aligned with the Paris Agreement.</description>

      <title>Effect of Waste Glass Powder Replacement of Hydraulic Lime on Properties of Natural Hydraulic Lime Mortars</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17215247</link>
      <description>Murat &#350;ahin, P. &#214;zyigit, Materials. 17(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403835555

                This paper investigates the effects of the partial replacement of natural hydraulic lime (NHL) with waste glass powder (GP) on the physical, mechanical, and microstructural properties of NHL mortars. In the experimental study, five mixtures containing up to 50% GP were prepared to evaluate its effect on the flow, carbonation, unit weight, water absorption, porosity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, capillary water absorption, compressive strength, and microstructure of NHL mortars. The experimental results suggest that the partial replacement of NHL with GP significantly affects the properties of NHL mortars. A reduction in compressive strength was observed with increasing GP content in mortars at both early and later stages. Nevertheless, the compressive strength difference between samples containing 50% GP and the reference was found to be relatively minor at 91 days, implying an enhanced pozzolanic reaction over time. The incorporation of GP improved the consistency and capillary water absorption of mortars, while the opposite was observed for ultrasonic pulse velocity, porosity, and water absorption. The microstructural analysis revealed distinct changes in the structure of samples incorporating GP. The partial substitution of hydraulic lime with GP could be beneficial in reducing the CO2 emissions of NHL mortars.</description>

      <title>Fuel tax loss in a world of electric mobility: A window of opportunity
  for congestion pricing</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2409.20033</link>
      <description>Thi Ngoc Nguyen, Felix Muesgens, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403814932

                The continued transition towards electric mobility will decrease energy tax revenues worldwide, which has substantial implications for government funds. At the same time, demand for transportation is ever increasing, which in turn increases congestion problems. Combining both challenges, this paper assesses the effectiveness of congestion pricing as a sustainable revenue stream to offset fuel tax loss in 2030 while simultaneously enhancing efficiency in the transport sector. A congestion-based toll that is road-and-time-variant is simulated for the greater Berlin area in Germany using the multi-agent transport simulation (MATSim) software. Through the simulation results, this paper quantifies the impacts of the toll on the governmental revenue, traffic management, environment, social welfare, and the distribution effects. We find that the revenue from congestion tolls in a metropolitan area can compensate the reduction in passenger car fuel tax. Furthermore, a remarkable welfare surplus is observed. The toll also successfully incentivises transport users to adjust their travel behaviour, which reduces traffic delay time by 28%. CO2 emissions as a key metric for decarbonisation of the transport sector decrease by more than 5%. The analysis of the distribution effects suggests that a redistribution plan with a focus on the middle-low-income residents and the outer boroughs could help the policy gain more public acceptance.</description>

      <title>Sustainability and Environmental Performance in Selective Collection of Residual Materials: Impact of Modulating Citizen Participation Through Policy and Incentive Implementation</title>

                The effective management of urban waste represents a growing challenge in the face of demographic evolution and increased consumption. This study explores the impacts of municipal strategic decisions on household waste management behaviours and sustainability performance outcomes through agent-based modelling. Using data from Gatineau and Beaconsfield in Quebec, Canada, the model is calibrated and validated to represent diverse urban contexts. Our analysis demonstrates that reducing collection frequency leads to notable increases in participation rates, reaching 78.2 &#177; 5.1% for collections every two weeks and 96.5 &#177; 8.3% for collections every five weeks. While this reduction improves bin filling levels, it concurrently decreases the recovery of recyclable materials by 2.8% and 19.5%, significantly undermining the environmental benefits of the recycling program. These findings highlight a complex interplay between collection frequency, citizen participation behaviour, waste stream characteristics, and overall environmental performance. While reducing collection frequency initially appears beneficial, it leads to operational challenges and increased CO2 emissions due to reduced material recovery. The research emphasises the need for tailored holistic waste management strategies that optimise performance outcomes while minimising environmental impacts. By understanding these dynamics, municipalities can develop more effective waste management policies that promote sustainability.</description>

      <title>Self-replicating fuels via autocatalytic molecular bond fission</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2410.01282</link>
      <description>Peter Agbo, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403885165

                This computational study advances a theoretical framework for practical, electrochemical fuel generation displaying exponential product yields and product formation rates as functions of time. Exponential reaction scaling is simulated through an autocatalytic cycle that emulates the process of DNA replication facilitated by the well-known polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here, an initial buildup of formate into a two-carbon chain through CO2 carboxylation forms oxalate. A subsequent, two-electron reduction yields glyoxylate, with base-mediated hydrolysis driving C-C bond fission of glyoxylate into two molecules of formate. These products are then recycled back to serve as reactants. This recursive process chemistry displays 2^n stoichiometries with respect to formate growth in the limit of ideal reaction selectivity. Each step of the proposed fuel cycle shows direct analogy to the steps of DNA annealing, nucleotide polymerization and hybridized strand fission that are responsible for the exponential product yields observed in PCR-mediated DNA synthesis. As a consequence of this replication behavior, rapid rates of fuel production are accessible even when the individual rate constants for the cycle's constituent processes are slow. Significant focus is placed on practical routes for realizing each of the three steps comprising this model case of formate replication, particularly the challenge of formate carboxylation and the corresponding energy demands and power constraints of the overall process.</description>

      <title>Carbon emission reduction associated with dapagliflozin compared to standard of care in the UK: translating the DAPA-HF and DELIVER trial findings to an environmental context</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae666.3618</link>
      <description>P. W. Ewan, Jihua Chen, Gwilym Roberts, Katherine Mullin, Laia Falc&#243;n, Mart&#237;n Cowie, European Heart Journal. 45(Supplement_1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403819082

                Abstract Background Healthcare systems account for 4&#8211;5% of UK national greenhouse gas emissions with delivery of care a major component.1 Preventing events that use healthcare resources should contribute to a reduction in emissions, in addition to the primary humanitarian aim of improving patient outcomes. The Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse-outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) and the Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patient with Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER) trials demonstrated that dapagliflozin reduced the frequency of hospitalizations for heart failure (hHF), urgent heart failure visits (UHFV) and cardiovascular (CV) death for patients with heart failure (HF).2,3 Purpose The study objective was to translate predicted differences in clinical events associated with dapagliflozin use in HF to a predicted carbon emission reduction from a UK perspective. Methods A previously published model4 based on pooled DAPA-HF and DELIVER event rates was used to predict hHF, UHFV and CV deaths in a cohort of 1,000 HF patients over a 3-year time horizon. Composite greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (as kg CO2 equivalent) were calculated from components sourced from the Sustainable Healthcare Coalition&#8217;s Care Pathway Calculator according to assumed clinical pathways and were applied to predicted incidence of hHF, UHFV and CV death events. Average length of stay was sourced from the National Heart Failure Audit.5 CV deaths occurring outside hospital were assumed to incur no additional carbon emission except that associated with cremation. Proportion of funerals by cremation and associated GHG emissions were sourced from literature.6,7 Future emissions were not discounted, representing the NHS&#8217;s aim to approach &#8216;net zero&#8217;. Results Over a 3-year time horizon, treatment with dapagliflozin was projected to prevent 74 hHF events, 9 UHFV events and 20 CV deaths per 1,000 patients treated versus placebo. Total estimated GHG emissions associated with hHF (233.2 kg CO2e), UHFV (177.4 kg CO2e), and CV death (251.4 kg CO2e) were 85,660 kg CO2e per 1,000 patients treated with dapagliflozin versus 109,618 kg CO2e per 1,000 patients treated with placebo. The projected total reduction associated with dapagliflozin treatment was 23,958 kg CO2e over 3 years, a 22% reduction versus placebo. Per population (~690,000 HF patients), total emissions prevented by dapagliflozin over 3 years were projected to be equivalent to driving 42 million miles in an average gasoline-powered passenger vehicle. Conclusion While the main aim of any therapeutic intervention is to save lives and improve patient outcomes, to capture the full spectrum of benefit to stakeholders the environmental consequences of new therapies should be considered in addition to their clinical and economic effects. Our analysis suggests treating patients with dapagliflozin may contribute to reducing the environmental burden of HF in addition to improving patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Results on the Use of an Original Burner for Reducing the Three-Way Catalyst Light-Off Time</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/inventions9060112</link>

                Individual road mobility comes with two major challenges: greenhouse gas emissions related to global warming and chemical pollution. For the pollution reduction in the spark ignition engine vehicle, the standard and reliable aftertreatment technology is the three-way catalytic converter (TWC). However, the TWC starts to convert once an optimal temperature, usually known as the light-off temperature, is reached. There are many methods to reduce the warm-up period of the TWC, among which is using a burner. The initial question underlying this study was to see if the use of a relatively straightforward extra-combustion device mounted upstream the TWC, without complex elements, was able to serve the purpose of reducing the light-off time. Consequently, an original burner was designed and investigated numerically via the CFD method and experimentally via measurements of the temperature evolution within a TWC, along with the emissions specific to the burner&#8217;s operation. The main findings of this study are: (1) the CFD-based examination is a good way to decide on how to achieve the so-called fit-for-purpose internal aerodynamics of the burner (i.e., to obtain a homogeneous mixture) and (2) to reach the light-off temperature, conventionally taken as 500 K, the burner was operated for 5.2 s, i.e., 3.6 g of gasoline injected, 2.7 g of CO2 and 1.351 g of CO, respectively, emitted. Moreover, this study identified measures for improving the burner&#8217;s design as well as an enhanced procedure for the burner&#8217;s operating control both aiming to produce a cleaner combustion during the TWC pre-heating.</description>

      <title>Research on Carbon Footprint Reduction During Hydrogen Co-Combustion in a Turbojet Engine</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17215397</link>
      <description>Bartosz Ciupek, &#321;ukasz Brodzik, Andrzej Fr&#261;ckowiak, Energies. 17(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403893739

                The paper presents experimental studies on the effect of co-combustion of aviation kerosene with hydrogen in the GTM400 turbojet engine on the change in the carbon footprint generated by the engine in relation to its standard operation without hydrogen in the fuel. This research is in line with current research and development trends carried out in the EU, linking them to the issues of the European Green Deal, the Fit for 55 directive and current environmental trends in aviation and energy. The main objective of the research was to check the effect of hydrogen co-combustion in a turbojet engine on the change of the carbon footprint, while a secondary objective was to verify the impact of higher exhaust gas temperatures generated by the new, high-calorific fuel on the secondary generation of nitrogen oxides (NOx), especially in the thermal mechanism, as an undesirable effect. The research shows that the co-combustion of hydrogen with aviation kerosene in a turbojet engine reduces the carbon footprint (reduction of CO2 maximum of 15% and CO emissions maximum of 24%), but also increases the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) maximum of 58%, including those generated in the thermal mechanism (significant increase in the temperature of exhaust gases), moreover, the increase in nitrogen oxide emissions is proportional to the amount of co-combusted hydrogen, which is directly related to the stoichiometry of the combustion process. The main conclusion of the research is that technologies for the combustion or co-combustion of hydrogen in turbojet engines require further research and development, mainly on the side of the use of excess exhaust gas temperature generated during combustion and methods of reducing secondary nitrogen oxides.</description>

                A proton exchange membrane electrolyzer can effectively utilize the electricity generated by intermittent solar power. Different methods of generating electricity may have different efficiencies and hydrogen production rates. Two coupled systems, namely, PV/T- and CPV/T-coupling PEMEC, respectively, are presented and compared in this study. A maximum power point tracking algorithm for the photovoltaic system is employed, and simulations are conducted based on the solar irradiation intensity and ambient temperature of a specific location on a particular day. The simulation results indicate that the hydrogen production is relatively high between 11:00 and 16:00, with a peak between 12:00 and 13:00. The maximum hydrogen production rate is 99.11 g/s and 29.02 g/s for the CPV/T-PEM and PV/T-PEM systems. The maximum energy efficiency of hydrogen production in CPV/T-PEM and PV/T-PEM systems is 66.7% and 70.6%. Under conditions of high solar irradiation intensity and ambient temperature, the system demonstrates higher total efficiency and greater hydrogen production. The CPV/T-PEM system achieves a maximum hydrogen production rate of 2240.41 kg/d, with a standard coal saving rate of 15.5 tons/day and a CO2 reduction rate of 38.0 tons/day. Compared to the PV/T-PEM system, the CPV/T-PEM system exhibits a higher hydrogen production rate. These findings provide valuable insights into the engineering application of photovoltaic/thermal-coupled hydrogen production technology and contribute to the advancement of this field.</description>

      <title>Hospital design and planning in the line of foresight of health needs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckae144.087</link>

                Abstract The health needs of the population are increasingly difficult to plan and predict. Technological progress, artificial intelligence, new medicines, but also ecological disasters, humanitarian crises, energy crisis and other challenges (as a Covid 19 pandemic) represent the image of our time. New design of hospitals should be able to respond to the challenges of the future: comprehensive provision of health services taking into account the patient&#8217;s needs, working conditions taking into account the hospital staff, energy efficiency and construction in accordance with high standards and reduction of CO2 emissions (green hospitals), to ensure alternative sources of electricity and water supply bearing in mind potential emergencies. The big challenge of long-term construction in which advanced technologies and new procedures cannot simply fit into a rigid building structure that is several decades old (example Serbia), so it is necessary to apply precise planning and efficient and high-quality construction in the next generation hospitals, taking into account current modern equipment and that which will appear in the future. Designing hospitals involves anticipating future healthcare challenges, technological advancements, demographic shifts, and changes in patient expectations. Hospitals emphasis on patient-centered design principles, creating environments that prioritize comfort, privacy, and dignity for patients and their families, accessibility and inclusivity, infection control and prevention, sustainability and resilience. Modern hospitals should create collaborative spaces for interdisciplinary teamwork and communication among healthcare providers, research and innovation units, but also community engagement and health promotion activities. Future hospital design requires strong multidisciplinary and cross-sectional cooperation, in which priority is given to architects dedicated to this field and their cooperation with public health and health management experts.</description>

      <title>A Combined Effect of Mixed Multi-Microplastic Types on Growth and Yield of Tomato</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202410.2190.v1</link>

                Microplastics (MPs) are plastic particles ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 &#181;m in diameter, posing a growing environmental and health risk. Composting is an excellent way to add nutrient-rich humus to the soil to boost plant development, but it also pollutes agricultural soil with MPs. Previous research has shown that MPs can threaten plant development, production, and quality, hence they must be studied. This study examined how a mixture of three MP types&#8212;polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), and polypropylene (PP)&#8212;affected greenhouse tomato plant development. MP types were spiked at 1% w/w (MPs/soil) in tomato pots, whereas non-spiked growth medium was the control. Statistical analysis was conducted using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test (95% confidence) to compare treatments and controls. Soil spiked with MPs increased chlorophyll content (SPAD), transpiration rate, photosynthetic rate, and stomata conductance by 5.16%, 16.71%, 25.81%, and 20.75%, respectively, compared to the control but decreased sub-stomata CO2 concentration by 3.23%. However, MPs did not significantly affect tomato plant morpho-physiological features (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Biochemical analysis of tomato fruits showed significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) reduction effects of MPs on carotenoid, total flavonoid, and sugar but increased protein, ascorbate, and peroxidase activity. However, there was no significant difference (p &amp;gt; 0.05) in the effects of the combined MPs on total phenolic content. These data imply that whereas MPs did not influence tomato plant physiological and morphological properties, tomato fruit biochemistry was reduced. This raise concerns that an increase in MPs in soils may reduce antioxidant content and negatively affect human health contributing to a decrease in food security.</description>

      <title>Experience of Production Increases in High Run Life Wells by Injection Optimization and the Inclusion of PMM Technology</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/221522-ms</link>

                Abstract Optimizing extensive ESP fields is a mandatory task in terms of carbon footprint and efficiency. The main goal is to keep the equipment running with the best efficiency as long as possible, acknowledging the ESP will show normal wear due to the operation. This analysis focuses on enhancing energy efficiency, allowing the definition of the true production capabilities by comparing operating conditions related to the motor technologies available for generating the best opportunities of improvement. By observing the well production response to increased injection in a seemingly optimized condition, it was proceeded to replace the ESP, incorporating PMM technology and a downhole sensor. This enabled us to: Define the actual IPR curve Simulate the condition on the extracted equipment (IM without a downhole sensor) Validate the deviation in ESP system efficiency Verify ESP wear through bench testing This approach allows for a comparison of extraction efficiency and the impact of wear associated with extended equipment run life. Based on the study findings, it is inferred that in ESPs with extended run life (&amp;gt;2000 days), wear leads to a decline in energy and production efficiency, reducing efficiency by up to 18.6%. These results prompt preventive measures to optimize wells, boosting production without significantly altering energy consumption. This is achievable by transitioning to PMM-equipped systems, significantly enhancing overall efficiency. With these results, preventive actions can be taken to adapt the wells and obtain an increase in production without considerably modifying energy consumption. This is possible through changing technology, installing PMM equipment and significantly improving the efficiency of the system. In addition, it allows capturing production that was not considered, establishing the correct extractive status of the well. Additionally, the impact on energy efficiency contributes to the reduction of CO2 emissions and improvement in specific consumption (KW/m3/d). Ultimately, assessing a well's extractive condition considering wear, reduced lifting capacity, and increased power consumption of an ESP is crucial. This approach facilitates well adaptation planning, minimizing downtime impact, enhancing system efficiency, and capturing additional oil in genuinely underexploited wells, thus preventing equipment failure This analysis provides an opportunity to accurately measure production status and true well potential. Enhancing extraction in these cases can significantly boost oil production (69% of increase in total fluid and about 150% in terms of net oil). The comparison performed considers post injection changes versus adequation of the system installing motors with PMM technology also around 17% savings in terms of energy are reached.</description>
