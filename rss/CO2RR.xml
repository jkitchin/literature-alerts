      <link>https://doi.org/10.54097/78z83e44</link>
      <description>Yuxuan Zhao, Highlights in Science Engineering and Technology. 116(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404210729

                This article introduces three significant ways of producing methane by electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide. Electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide can efficiently convert CO2 molecules into various high-energy fuels under ambient conditions. Methane gas, among them, stands out due to its relatively high calorific value, chemical stability, ease of storage and transportation. Therefore, research on electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to generate methane is crucial. Common methods include adjusting catalyst morphology to expose more active sites, building nanoscale catalysts results in smaller-sized nanostructured copper and combining copper with other metals to form alloys, creating multi-metal catalysts. By optimizing these catalysts, we can efficiently reduce carbon dioxide into methane.</description>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising technology for the utilization of captured CO2. Though systems using aqueous electrolytes is the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, CO2RR in aprotic solvents are a promising alternative that can avoid the parallel hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). While system parameters, such as electrolyte composition, electrode material, and applied potential are known to influence the reaction mechanism, there is a lack of intuitive understanding as to how. We show that by using multivariate data analysis on a large dataset collected from the literature, namely random forest modelling, the most important system parameters can be isolated for each possible product. We find that water content, current density, and applied potential are powerful determinants in the reaction pathway, and therefore in the Faradaic efficiency of CO2RR products.</description>

                Abstract The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to the reduced chemical compounds offers substantial environmental benefits through minimizing the emission of greenhouse gas and fostering sustainable practices. Recently, the unique properties of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) make them attractive candidates for electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), providing many opportunities to develop efficient, selective, and environmentally sustainable processes for mitigating CO 2 emissions and utilizing CO 2 as a valuable raw material for the synthesis of fuels and chemicals. Here, the recent advances in MOFs as efficient catalysts for electrocatalytic CO 2 RR are summarized. The detailed characteristics, electrocatalytic mechanisms, and practical approaches for improving the electrocatalytic efficiency, selectivity, and durability of MOFs under realistic reaction conditions are also clarified. Furthermore, the outlooks on the prospects of MOF-based electrocatalysts in CO 2 RR are provided.</description>

      <title>Buildings in Hot Climate Zones&#8212;Quantification of Energy and CO2 Reduction Potential for Different Architecture and Building Services Measures</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16229812</link>
      <description>Doris &#214;sterreicher, Axel Seerig, Sustainability. 16(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404275302

                Reducing energy and associated greenhouse gas emissions in buildings is one of the key aspects of climate change on a global level. To put the building sector on a low carbon development path, policies and adequate financing play a crucial role in each region. In the global South, policies and regulations related to the decarbonization of the building stock are increasingly being implemented. For policy and decision makers, adequate data on the status quo of the building stock, as well as the quantification of energy reduction measures, are essential to make informed decisions on the building regulatory and funding framework. The objective of this study is to provide data-driven insights into the potential for energy and CO2 reduction in buildings across various hot climate zones in the Global South. A simulation-based approach was employed to model five different building types, ranging from residential homes to office buildings, under a variety of architectural and building services scenarios. The simulations were conducted using the dynamic building energy simulation tool EnergyPlus, which assessed the impact of various energy-saving measures under both current and projected future climate conditions. This study concludes that optimizing passive design features, such as improved windows, solar shading, and reflective surfaces, in conjunction with active systems like decentralized cooling units and renewable energy integration, can result in a notable reduction in energy demand and emissions. Our findings provide a robust basis for policymakers to develop targeted energy efficiency strategies for buildings in hot climate zones, which will play a crucial role in achieving climate goals in the Global South.</description>

      <title>Integrated Carbon Dioxide Capture by Amines and Conversion to Methane on Single-Atom Nickel Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c09744</link>

                Direct electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture species, i.e., carbamate and (bi)carbonate, can be promising for CO2 capture and conversion from point-source, where the energetically demanding stripping step is bypassed. Here, we describe a class of atomically dispersed nickel (Ni) catalysts electrodeposited on various electrode surfaces that are shown to directly convert captured CO2 to methane (CH4). A detailed study employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron microscopy (EM) indicate that highly dispersed Ni atoms are uniquely active for converting capture species to CH4, and the activity of single-atom Ni is confirmed using control experiments with a molecularly defined Ni phthalocyanine catalyst supported on carbon nanotubes. Comparing the kinetics of various capture solutions obtained from hydroxide, ammonia, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines provide evidence that carbamate, rather than (bi)carbonate and/or dissolved CO2, is primarily responsible for CH4 production. This conclusion is supported by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of capture solutions as well as control experiments comparing reaction selectivity with and without CO2 purging. These findings are understood with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations showing that single-atom nickel (Ni) dispersed on gold (Au) is active for the direct reduction of carbamate, producing CH4 as the primary product. This is the first example of direct electrochemical conversion of carbamate to CH4, and the mechanism of this process provides new insight on the potential for integrated capture and conversion of CO2 directly to hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>Optimum Planning of Carbon Capture and Storage Network Using Goal Programming</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12112463</link>

                Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical technology used for mitigating climate change by capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources and storing them underground to prevent their release into the atmosphere. Despite its potential, optimizing CCS systems for cost-effectiveness and efficiency improvement remains a significant challenge. In this paper, the optimization of CCS systems through the development and application of two mathematical optimization techniques is introduced. The first technique is based on using a superstructure optimization model, while the second technique relies on applying a goal programming optimization model. These models were solved using LINGO software version API 14.0.5099.166 to enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of CCS systems. The first model, seeking to maximize the exchange of CO2 flowrate from sources to sinks, achieved a CO2 capture rate of 93.36% with an annual total cost of USD 1.175 billion. The second model introduced a novel mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) approach for multi-objective optimization, targeting the minimization of total system cost, alternative storage, and unutilized storage while maximizing CO2 load exchange. The application of the second model, when prioritized to maximize CO2 flowrate exchange using the goal programming technique, resulted in a cost reduction of 36.46% and a CO2 capture rate of 75.87%. In contrast, when the second model prioritized minimizing the total annual cost, a 48% cost reduction was achieved, and the CO2 capture rate was decreased by 68.37%. A comparison of the two models&#8217; results is presented. The results showed that the second model, with the priority of maximizing CO2 capture, provides the best economic&#8211;environmental objective balance, which offers notable cost reductions while keeping an efficient CO2 capture rate. This study highlights the potential of advanced mathematical modeling in increasing the feasibility of CCS as one of the very important strategies of mitigating climate change and reducing global warming.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Carbon Footprint from a Drilling Project in Niger Delta, Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.51583/ijltemas.2024.131013</link>
      <description>Chukwu Emeke, Ayanfeoluwa Obe, Olugbenga Olamigoke, International Journal of Latest Technology in Engineering Management &amp; Applied Science. 13(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404193665

                Abstract: The oil and gas industry plays a significant role in the release of carbon emissions into the atmosphere. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately gauge and minimize its carbon footprint which requires the thorough measurement of emissions and the identification of the primary sources of carbon emissions. By doing so, we can then determine the most effective methods for reducing these emissions. This study aims to precisely quantify and decrease the carbon footprint associated with drilling operations. To achieve this, we evaluated the diesel and petrol consumption from an onshore drilling project in the Niger Delta and used an emissions model to assess carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from a drilling rig, thus gaining a comprehensive understanding of current emission levels and the potential for reduction. The data collected included the daily fuel consumption for power generation, transportation, and handling vehicles. The CO2 emissions resulting from fuel consumption were calculated and measured to be 103.5 metric tonnes. Our analysis determined that the primary contributor to the emissions was the energy generation on the site, primarily from the generators. Additionally, it was found that the circulating system on the rig was the main source of CO2 emissions. The study underscores the necessity for long-term impact assessments of drilling fluids and new technologies, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions to further decrease emissions.</description>

      <title>The challenge of reducing diesel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions: A perspective on the use of hydrogen in mining trucks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.37190/msc243101</link>
      <description>Robson Lage Figueiredo, Carlos A. Ortiz, Jos&#233; Margarida da Silva, Mining Science. 31(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404116115

                In mining, the traditional system of operation relies on equipment that consumes large amounts of energy. In mine operations, trucks are widely used due to their flexibility, loading ca-pacity, and adaptability to various terrain conditions. However, they have high diesel oil consump-tion and high emission rates of smoke, particulate matter, and mainly carbon gas from diesel en-gines. This article offers a comprehensive view on the effect of hydrogen added to the diesel engine in the search for renewable energy alternatives that are in tune with the reduction of the environ-mental impact arising from the use of petroleum-derived fuels. The article presents an overview about the challenges in reducing the diesel fuel consumption of trucks employed in mining. It ap-proaches the effect of controlled hydrogen addition on diesel engine performance, consumption reduction, and greenhouse gas emissions. Followed by a discussion of the main technologies used to manufacture hydrogen and their production costs. The results of the studies show that hydrogen is a promising alternative for reducing operational, energy, and emissions costs, mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO), but it faces barriers in production, storage, and supply costs. We highlight the &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221;, carbon-free, which contributes to the decarbonization process in mines, as open pit or underground ones.</description>

                The valorization of carbon dioxide as a C1 building block in C&#8208;C bond forming reactions is a critical link on the road to carbon&#8208;circular chemistry. Activation of this inert molecule through reduction with H2 to carbon monoxide in the reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction can be followed by a wide spectrum of consecutive carbonylation reactions, but the RWGS is severely equilibrium limited at the moderate temperatures of carbonylations. Here we successfully reconcile both reactions in one pot, while avoiding incompatibilities through a zeolite&#8208;based compartmentalized approach. More specifically, Pt encapsulated in a small&#8208;pore LTA zeolite selectively generates carbon monoxide in mild reaction conditions; an ensuing one&#8208;pot carbonylation reaction allows to shift the equilibrium through continuous consumption of CO. Moreover, the zeolite encapsulation avoids undesired reactions like hydrogenation of the olefin reactant through a molecular sieving effect. This strategy was first studied in&#8208;depth for Rh&#8208;catalyzed olefin hydroformylation with CO2/H2, affording aldehydes in good yields with high regioselectivities. The methodology was then extended to a variety of carbonylations using CO2 for the synthesis of bulk and fine chemicals.</description>

      <title>Efficacy and safety of sequential treatment with botulinum toxin type A, fractional CO2 laser, and topical growth factor for hypertrophic scar management: a retrospective analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-78094-y</link>
      <description>Sheng Wang, Lan Huang, Juan Li, Rui Xu, Guoqin Chen, Tong Huang, Yanping Wu, Yang Yang, Jiale Zhang, Feng Jiang, Huan Liu, Liang Li, Li Wang, Scientific Reports. 14(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404187516

                Hypertrophic scars arise from aberrant wound healing and can lead to functional and aesthetic impairments. One of the common interventions for treating hypertrophic scars is fractional carbon dioxide (CO2) laser, which employs narrow laser beams to stimulate dermal collagen deposition. Recent studies and reports have suggested that combining laser therapy with other interventions such as botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) and topical growth factors may enhance treatment outcomes. Here, we examine the efficacy and safety of a sequential combination of BTX-A, fractional CO2 laser, and topical growth factors, referred to as combined therapy, for treating hypertrophic scars compared with only using fractional CO2 laser and topical growth factors, referred to as monotherapy. Our retrospective study includes 128 patients with hypertrophic scars (56 underwent monotherapy and 72 underwent combined therapy), which were followed-up for up to 15 months after the initiation of treatment to collect demographic and clinical data. Our analysis showed that the combined therapy significantly outperformed monotherapy in improving Vancouver scar scale scores (P &lt; 0.05) and in the reduction of scar thickness (P &lt; 0.05), without increasing adverse complications. Repeated treatments further augmented the efficacy of the combined therapy. Subgroup analysis revealed that combined therapy was notably more effective in reducing Vancouver scar scale scores and scar thickness in early-stage scars compared to late-stage (P = 0.023 and P = 0.045, respectively). Our study suggests that including BTX-A treatment before fractional CO2 laser and topical growth factors offers superior efficacy in reducing hypertrophic scars. We encourage early intervention and repeated treatments for optimal treatment outcomes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of nanoparticle additives in reducing emissions in compression ignition engine</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.47264/idea.ajset/3.1.4</link>
      <description>Muhammad Siddique Baloch, Zohaib Khan, Sher Muhammad Ghoto, Sajjad Bhangwar, Arif Ali Rind, Irfan Gul, Muhammad Ramzan Luhur, Deleted Journal. 3(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404103789

                The paper discusses the growing environmental issues caused by vehicle emissions, leading many countries to tighten their emission standards to reduce the harmful gases released by motor vehicles. This is especially important as urbanization has increased, leading to more consumption of petroleum products. As a result, there is a growing need for cleaner, more sustainable fuel alternatives. Biodiesel has been recognized as a potential solution since it is renewable, non-toxic, and less environmentally harmful than traditional diesel. The study in question explores how adding biodiesel and nanoparticles affects diesel engine performance, particularly in terms of noise and particulate matter emissions (small particles of pollution). The research was carried out using a compression ignition engine (like those found in diesel vehicles) under constant RPM (revolutions per minute) and variable loads (changes in engine stress or power requirements). The results showed that when biodiesel was blended with nanoparticles and used as fuel, there was a noticeable reduction in noise levels, carbon dioxide (CO2), and particulate matter emissions compared to regular diesel. This suggests that biodiesel, especially when enhanced with nanoparticles, can effectively lower the harmful effects of diesel engines on the environment, offering a greener and quieter alternative.</description>

      <title>The Effects of an Adaptive Ventilation Control System on Indoor Air Quality and Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16229836</link>
      <description>Vasilica Vasile, Vlad Iordache, Valentin Mihai Radu, Cristian Petcu, Claudiu-Sorin Dragomir, Sustainability. 16(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404273108

                Indoor air quality (IAQ) and energy consumption (Q) are well-known building estimators, but they are used separately. Energy consumption is used during the design stage, while IAQ is used during operation. The novelty of our approach is that we propose using both estimators simultaneously during building operations. The purpose of this study was to find an adaptive ventilation strategy that maintained good indoor air quality with minimal energy consumption. The second novelty of our approach consists of IAQ estimation. While the operation of ventilation systems depends only on the indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration at present, our novel approach uses a more global IAQ index that includes four different air pollutants. Physical models are used for the hourly prediction of the two indices: global IAQ and Q. This study presents a comparative analysis of several ventilation operations strategies: fixed versus adaptive. The main findings show that a decrease in the ventilation rate, na, from 3.5 h&#8722;1 to 2.0 h&#8722;1 leads to a diminishment in energy consumption of 42.9%, maintaining the global IAQ index under the limited health risk value (VRL). Moreover, an adaptive ventilation strategy of na, maintaining the global IAQ index value under VRL, achieves a further reduction in energy consumption of 72.9%, highlighting its efficiency.</description>

                The benefits of low-pressure laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LPLC) in patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the feasibility and pulmonary effects of LPLC in patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities. This was a multicenter, parallel, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Eligible patients included patients with cardiac or pulmonary comorbidities, who were randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo LPLC (10 mmHg) or standard-pressure laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SPLC) (14 mmHg). The primary outcome was postoperative partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO2). Surgical safety variables, patient recovery, pulmonary function parameters, and surgeon comfort were also compared between groups. This study enrolled 144 participants, with 124 participants extracted for the final analysis (62 in LPLC and 62 in SPLC group, respectively). The median postoperative PaCO2 was similar in the LPLC (43.3 mmHg) and SPLC (43.0 mmHg) groups (p = 0.988). Pulmonary parameters including postoperative pH, PaCO2, HCO3, and lactate levels were similar between the two groups. Postoperative base excess was significantly higher in the LPLC group (&#8722; 0.6 mmol/L [&#8722; 6.9 ~ 7.5] vs. &#8722;1.9 mmol/L [&#8722; 6.6 ~ 5.4]; p = 0.031). There was no between-group difference regarding intraabdominal operative time, rate of intraoperative bile spillage, blood loss, surgeon comfort during surgery, and conversion rate. Moreover, postoperative major complication rates, the median time to the first flatus, postoperative hospital stay, or mean postoperative visual analog scale score for pain were similar in both groups. This study found no reduction of partial pressure of CO2 with LPLC compared with SPLC for patients with cardiopulmonary comorbidities. LPLC with a pneumoperitoneum pressure of 10 mmHg may be safe and feasible for these patients when performed by experienced surgeons, although it does not improve pulmonary parameters. The trial is retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04670952) on December 17, 2020.</description>

      <title>A Review of Sustainability in Hot Asphalt Production: Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app142210246</link>
      <description>Yancheng Liu, Zhengyi Liu, Youwei Zhu, Haitao Zhang, Applied Sciences. 14(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404141536

                This study conducted a thorough analysis of energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the production of hot mix asphalt. The primary sources of energy usage in asphalt mixes are the heating of aggregates, asphalt, and burners, with aggregate heating accounting for a remarkable 97% of the total energy consumption. The results indicate that low-temperature asphalt mixes offer significant benefits over conventional hot mix asphalt in terms of energy efficiency and GHG emissions, with reductions in carbon dioxide emissions ranging from 18% to 36% and energy savings between 15% and 87%. Additionally, the use of recycled asphalt pavement led to a 12% decrease in carbon dioxide emissions and a 15% reduction in energy consumption. The study further explored the effects of various fuel types on emissions, revealing that replacing fuel oil with natural gas can effectively diminish the carbon footprint of the production process. By optimizing production temperatures and selecting cleaner fuel alternatives, this research highlights the potential for considerable energy savings and emission reductions within the asphalt production sector. These strategies not only promote sustainable road construction practices but also play a vital role in environmental protection and climate change mitigation, advocating for the adoption of innovative technologies in asphalt pavement production.</description>

                Abstract. With the development of the global economy and trade exchanges worldwide, urban infrastructure and industrial development have become part of the competition among countries. However, the construction industry and the production of chemical materials emit a large amount of carbon dioxide, leading to the continuous deterioration of the environment, so it is necessary to effectively reduce emissions. As a synonym for global emission reduction, carbon neutrality plays an important role in different industries, especially in civil engineering. In this paper, we start with building materials and green construction to explore the realization of carbon neutrality at the source and center of carbon emission in civil engineering. Firstly, we introduce the low-carbon production technologies of cement and steel, including calcium recycling and membrane separation technology in the cement industry, high-temperature combustion technology and carbon capture technology in steel industry. Then, we take renewable concrete as an example to discuss the emission reduction path of green building materials. Finally, it outlines how to carry out green construction, introduces assembly carbon reduction technology and energy integration system, and demonstrates the possibility of this green construction program in the case of "T&amp;A House".</description>

                Abstract Bohai is rich in heavy oil. And its efficient development is significant. In this essay, ordinary heavy oil and extra one were selected, and the viscosity characteristics was also investigated referring to its internal composition. And so as the reducing viscosity effects of steam, oil-soluble viscosity reducer, diesel, emulsifier, flue gas and carbon dioxide. The experimental results show that resin and asphaltene content have positive effect on the viscosity of heavy oil. Compared with ordinary heavy oil, the drop is significantly greater when the temperature increases by 10&#176;C. For ordinary heavy oil, the inflection point temperature is from 50&#176;C to 70&#176;C, and for extra-heavy oil, it is above 100&#176;C. For ordinary heavy oil, its flow effect can be better improved without too high temperature, while it&#8217;s totally different for super heavy oil. For which, higher temperature and other auxiliary viscosity reduction methods are needed to achieve better flow performance. Diesel oil reduce viscosity of heavy oil by similar solubility principle, but the demand for diesel oil is large. At 50&#176;C, the viscosity of super heavy oil with 0.5% emulsion viscosity reducer added is 36 mPa&#183;s, but the water content needs to reach above 30%.Oil-soluble viscosity reducer reduces viscosity by dissolving asphaltenes and resins and dismantling aggregate structure of heavy oil aromatic flakes.However, the dosage should reach about 20 %, so that the viscosity of super heavy oil can be reduced to the level of dilute oil. Overall, for developing super heavy oil, steam compound with oil soluble viscosity reducer can be taken into account at the early production stage, and the emulsion viscosity reducer can be used in the middle development stage and wellbore viscosity reduction and lifting process. Finally, for ordinary heavy oil, flue gas&#8217;s viscosity reduction effects, nitrogen and carbon dioxide are investigated. It is found that the viscosity reduction effect of carbon dioxide is the best, followed by flue gas and nitrogen. Considering the offshore gas source, cost and carbon emission requirements, it is recommended to use flue gas in the field. The research provides theoretical guidance and technical reference for development of different types of offshore heavy oil.</description>

                The use of non-fired materials with additives of vegetable waste instead of traditional building ceramics reduces the energy input and the carbon footprint in the construction sector. This applies to one- and two-story buildings due to the lower load-bearing capacity of non-fired bricks. A possibility for substitution of the fired ceramics with non-fired clay bricks with additives of straw at the building of the walls of a single-family house is analyzed. The subsequent reductions of the embodied energy, carbon dioxide, and thermal losses of the buildings are determined.</description>

      <title>Reforming Natural Gas for CO2 Pre-Combustion Capture in Trinary Cycle Power Plant</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17225544</link>
      <description>Nikolay Rogalev, Andrey Rogalev, Vladimir Kindra, Olga Zlyvko, Dmitry Kovalev, Energies. 17(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404111871

                Today, most of the world&#8217;s electric energy is generated by burning hydrocarbon fuels, which causes significant emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere by thermal power plants. In world practice, flue gas cleaning systems for removing nitrogen oxides, sulfur, and ash are successfully used at power facilities but reducing carbon dioxide emissions at thermal power plants is still difficult for technical and economic reasons. Thus, the introduction of carbon dioxide capture systems at modern power plants is accompanied by a decrease in net efficiency by 8&#8211;12%, which determines the high relevance of developing methods for increasing the energy efficiency of modern environmentally friendly power units. This paper presents the results of the development and study of the process flow charts of binary and trinary combined-cycle gas turbines with minimal emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere. This research revealed that the net efficiency rate of a binary CCGT with integrated post-combustion technology capture is 39.10%; for a binary CCGT with integrated pre-combustion technology capture it is 40.26%; a trinary CCGT with integrated post-combustion technology capture is 40.35%; and for a trinary combined-cycle gas turbine with integrated pre-combustion technology capture it is 41.62%. The highest efficiency of a trinary CCGT with integrated pre-combustion technology capture is due to a reduction in the energy costs for carbon dioxide capture by 5.67 MW&#8212;compared to combined-cycle plants with integrated post-combustion technology capture&#8212;as well as an increase in the efficiency of the steam&#8211;water circuit of the combined-cycle plant by 3.09% relative to binary cycles.</description>

      <title>Individual building based net-zero emission transition pathways for global cities</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5368270/v1</link>
      <description>Dabo Guan, Yuxin Chen, Zhenyu Wang, Jing Meng, Jun Bi, Jingwen Huo, Shuping Li, Zhou Li, Peipei Chen, Diling Liang, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404217554

                Abstract Carbon reduction during the operational phase of buildings is a critical component in achieving global carbon neutrality objectives. Current methods for estimating carbon dioxide emissions in this phase predominantly focus on national or city-level scales, often ignoring the heterogeneity in building types and functions. This oversight limits the precision with which low-carbon management technologies can be applied to retrofit existing buildings effectively. To address this gap, we develop a building-based emissions accounting approach at city-scale that considers building type, function, floor area, and floor height of individual building. Additionally, we integrate point source data from facility-level power plants to characterize the structure of the energy supply sector. We then propose a suite of emission reduction technologies tailored for the operational phase of buildings, constructing baseline, regulatory, and blueprint scenarios to analyze the emission reduction pathways from 2020 to 2050. The demand-side pathways primarily target two key areas of emission reduction, such as modifying energy consumption behaviors by replacing conventional lighting with energy-efficient alternatives. On the supply-side, three major technological categories are addressed, including the conversion of coal-fired power plants to coal-biomass co-firing systems to enhance power generation efficiency. We applied the methodology to a global city of Nanjing, encompassing 534,000 individual buildings across 101 streets. Our analysis reveals that the carbon intensity of terminal energy use in commercial buildings in Nanjing is approximately 3.9 times higher than that in residential buildings. Enhancing energy efficiency in end-use sectors such as HVAC systems, commercial lighting, and electrical equipment emerges as the most effective strategy for reducing carbon emissions during the operational phase of commercial buildings. From a supply-side perspective, the early retirement of coal-fired power plants offers the most significant contribution to emission reductions. This approach accelerates the transition to a more efficient energy structure by phasing out outdated capacities before 2045 and optimizing the deployment of advanced power generation technologies, such as solar, wind, nuclear. Our findings offer targeted pathways for emission reduction during the operational phase of buildings and provide valuable scientific insights for policymakers.</description>

                Abstract This study explores a new approach in modeling explicit targets for decarbonization of the electricity and transport sectors combined with separate targets for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) based on the current plans and strategies put forward or expected by countries. Additionally, we examine an equitable "fair share" scenario that aligns sectoral decarbonization timelines and CDR liabilities with the respective capabilities of countries. In this "capability" burden-sharing principle, developed countries with the financial means to support their climate change mitigation efforts undertake faster energy transition while developing countries with lower incomes are allowed an extended timeline for decarbonization and are exempted from excessive CDR obligations. Here, we modify a technology-rich multi-sector model in a manner where explicit sectoral emission reduction and CDR targets can be modeled. Our analysis reveals that adopting this sector-specific strategy shows a potential reduction in residual emissions by up to 35%, and a 35-45% decrease in carbon removal requirement. Furthermore, sector-specific decarbonization and carbon removal targets not only help mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change but also promote sustainability by supporting food security and reducing the global demand for water, land, and fertilizer necessary for energy production and negative emissions.</description>

      <description>Ziqin Meng, Highlights in Science Engineering and Technology. 116(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404191007

                The global transition to electric vehicles (EVs) is crucial for reducing carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) emissions and combating climate change. Although EVs offer environmental and economic advantages, battery performance challenges such as electrode degradation and electrolyte decomposition hinder their widespread adoption. This paper investigates the use of nanomaterials in battery coatings and membranes to improve EV battery performance and lifespan. Conductive polymers like Polyaniline (PANI), carbon-based materials such as g-C&#8323;N&#8324;/CNTs, and &#945;-Fe&#8322;O&#8323;@C are explored for their capacity to enhance electrode stability, electrical conductivity, and specific capacity. Additionally, the paper addresses how nanocoatings mitigate issues like electrode degradation, parasitic reactions, and thermal management, ultimately extending battery life and improving safety. By integrating nanotechnology, significant advancements in battery efficiency, longevity, and safety can be achieved, making EVs a more viable and sustainable transportation option. These developments are essential for achieving global carbon reduction goals and supporting a cleaner future.</description>

                Abstract Excessive emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) have caused the greenhouse effect and environmental crisis. Therefore, the carbon reduction and negative carbon technologies are particularly important. Among these, the negative carbon technologies that convert CO 2 into carbon materials or carbon&#8208;based chemicals for reuse have attracted significant attention. However, the strong double covalent bonds make the CO 2 conversion usually require harsh conditions, complex processes, and high energy consumption. Gallium&#8208;based liquid metals (LMs) are the functional materials with both metallic and liquid properties, exhibiting a unique liquid&#8208;phase structure and diverse surface characteristics. Herein, a strategy for reducing CO 2 is proposed to carbon materials by utilizing the spontaneous phase transition and mechanical friction of liquid metals. The gallium (Ga) and indium (In) particles are mixed and exposed to CO 2 , the contact interface of metal particles spontaneously transforms into liquid metals. The system has multistage interfaces, including Ga/In, Ga/eGaIn, and In/eGaIn, capable of generating triboelectrification upon mechanical stimulation, leading to charge transfer. The high electric field generated by friction at the contact interface directly reduces CO 2 to carbon materials at room temperature. The carbon materials cover the surface of eGaIn and can be directly stripped for used as fuel, or industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Cobalt Phosphide Decorating Metallic Cobalt With a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Nano&#8208;Shell Surpasses Platinum Group Metals for Oxygen Electrocatalysis Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/bte2.20240029</link>
      <description>Muhammad Tahir, Muhammad Asim Farid, Elvin Aliyev, Zhen&#8208;Feng Huang, Ji&#8208;Jun Zou, Shangfeng Du, Battery energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404117598

                ABSTRACT It has been a long&#8208;standing challenge to cultivate capable and resilient oxygen electrocatalysts with higher activity, low price, and long lifetime to replace the commonly used platinum group metals, i.e., Pt for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and RuO 2 /IrO 2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This work presents a promising approach to address the challenges associated with oxygen electrocatalysis by introducing a cobalt phosphide/metallic cobalt (Co 2 P/Co) core wrapped in a nitrogen&#8208;doped conductive carbon (CN) nano&#8208;shell, demonstrated as Co 2 P/Co@NC. The strong chemical bonding between metallic cobalt and phosphorus, nitrogen and conductive carbon contributes to the enhanced conductivity and stability of the electrocatalyst. The nitrogen doping in the carbon shell provides additional Co&#8211;N active sites, which are crucial for ORR activity. Co 2 P/Co@NC demonstrates promising activity and stability compared to noble metals such as Pt for ORR in an alkaline medium. This suggests its potential as a cost&#8208;effective alternative to Pt&#8208;based catalysts. Further, due to factors such as strong cobalt&#8208;phosphide bonding, high cobalt oxidation states and excellent conductivity of the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon shell, the Co 2 P/Co@NC outperforms noble metal oxides like iridium dioxide (IrO 2 ) and ruthenium dioxide (RuO 2 ) for OER. Co 2 P/Co@NC exhibits a low potential difference of 0.63 V, which is among the lowest reported for bifunctional electrocatalysts capable of both ORR and OER. Overall, the described strategy offers a promising avenue for developing efficient, low&#8208;cost and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen reactions, which are crucial for various electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies, such as fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Electronic Properties of CumAgn Bimetallic Clusters for Enhanced CO2 Activation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252212053</link>
      <description>Turki Alotaibi, Moteb Alotaibi, Fatimah Alhawiti, Norah Aldosari, Majd Alsunaid, Lama Aldawas, Talal F. Qahtan, Ali K. Ismael, International Journal of Molecular Sciences. 25(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404224096

                The urgent demand for efficient CO2 reduction technologies has driven enormous studies into the enhancement of advanced catalysts. Here, we investigate the electronic properties and CO2 adsorption properties of CumAgn bimetallic clusters, particularly Cu4Ag1, Cu1Ag4, Cu3Ag2, and Cu2Ag3, using generalized gradient approximation (GGA)/density functional theory (DFT). Our results show that the atomic arrangement within these clusters drastically affects their stability, charge transfer, and catalytic performance. The Cu4Ag1 bimetallic cluster emerges as the most stable structure, revealing superior charge transfer and effective chemisorption of CO2, which promotes effective activation of the CO2 molecule. In contrast, the Cu1Ag4 bimetallic cluster, in spite of comparable adsorption energy, indicates insignificant charge transfer, resulting in less pronounced CO2 activation. The Cu3Ag2 and Cu2Ag3 bimetallic clusters also display high adsorption energies with remarkable charge transfer mechanisms, emphasizing the crucial role of metal composition in tuning catalytic characteristics. This thorough examination provides constructive insights into the design of bimetallic clusters for boosted CO2 reduction. These findings could pave the way for the development of cost-effective and efficient catalysts for industrial CO2 reduction, contributing to global efforts in carbon management and climate change mitigation.</description>

      <title>EXPRESS: Responsibilizing the Net-Zero Hero? Creation and Implications of a Tragic Subject Position</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/07439156241300997</link>

                The energy sector is the largest contributor to global carbon dioxide emissions. To address the current climate emergency however, energy market actors (e.g., energy providers, nongovernmental organizations, policy makers) try to make individual consumers take responsibility for achieving an overall net balance of zero greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of this research is to understand this process of responsibilization and its implications. The research method is a narrative discourse analysis of hundreds of public documents by energy market actors. The findings show that market actors try to shape ordinary consumers into &#8220;net-zero heroes&#8221; with responsibility for emissions reduction but end up creating a tragedy when they translate their collective agenda. These findings have implications for consumer responsibilization specifically and the conversion of agendas into action more generally. Theoretically, this research shows (1) the influence of the translation stage in the agenda-to-action chain, (2) the way market actors attempt to form net-zero heroes, and (3) the limited usefulness of the hero narrative. Practically, the research explains the implications of making consumers solely responsible for the emissions reduction problem.</description>

      <title>Addressing Climate Change: The Role of Agriculture in Greenhouse Gas Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.9734/arja/2024/v17i4581</link>
      <description>Kishore S. M, Shanker Raj Barsila, D. Kavya, K. Vishnu Priya Kathula, K. Aruna, V S Abhishek, Asian Research Journal of Agriculture. 17(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404113415

                Agriculture is a cornerstone of global food security, which is significantly affected by climate change, primarily driven by human activities that increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Accounting for approximately 13% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions, agricultural practices-such as livestock rearing, rice cultivation and synthetic fertilizer use which contribute substantially to global warming. Emissions from nitrous oxide (N&#8322;O), methane (CH&#8324;) and carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) exacerbate this issue, with N&#8322;O being particularly concerning due to its high global warming potential. Mitigation strategies within the agricultural sector are essential, including improved nutrient management, the use of nitrification inhibitors and innovative fertilizer application technologies. Organic farming demonstrates lower N&#8322;O emissions compared to conventional practices, emphasizing the importance of sustainable agricultural methods. Additionally, conservation tillage and practices like zero-tillage help reduce CO&#8322; emissions by minimizing soil disturbance and enhancing carbon sequestration. Biochar application further supports soil health and GHG reduction by enhancing carbon storage. To mitigate methane emissions from rice fields, reduced tillage and the introduction of electron acceptors can effectively inhibit methanogenesis. As CO&#8322; constitutes about 72% of total GHG emissions, agricultural practices that increase soil organic carbon (SOC) are critical for effective carbon sequestration. Overall, the agricultural sector holds significant potential for GHG mitigation, with studies suggesting that 89% of the mitigation potential can be achieved through carbon sequestration. Therefore, adopting these strategies is crucial not only for reducing emissions but also for ensuring sustainable agricultural productivity in the face of climate change challenges.</description>

      <title>Planning and Optimisation of Renewable Energy Systems for Decarbonising Operations of Oil Refineries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s41660-024-00461-z</link>

                Abstract Given the urgency to transition to low carbon future, oil refineries need to identify feasible strategies for decarbonisation. One way to address this is by integrating renewable energy systems. However, the high initial costs and intermittency appeared to be the key barriers for the adoption of renewable energy technologies. Hence, a multi-period optimisation model is developed via mixed integer linear programming in this work to determine the optimal renewable energy system in terms of cost and its optimal energy storage technology to enhance its flexibility for oil refinery operations. This model aims to minimise the costs of the renewable energy system while considering its ability to accommodate the varying energy demands across the time periods. An oil refinery case study is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed model. The developed model is expected to propose an optimal renewable energy system that meets the energy demands and, at the same time, achieves the decarbonisation goal. Based on the results, the optimal renewable energy system comprises cost-effective technologies to generate various energy outputs including electricity, hydrogen, high-pressure and medium-pressure steam to meet energy demands. Additionally, the result of the case study shows that the integration of renewable energy systems achieves a reduction of 5,353 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Apart from that, the incorporation of energy-efficient energy storage results in a 10% reduction in the total cost of the optimal renewable energy system. Compressed hydrogen gas storage and battery were used to store excess hydrogen and electricity during periods with low demands and subsequently consumed during peak demand periods. This can, therefore, reduce the technological capacity required. With the aid of storage facilities, the flexibility of the renewable energy system is elevated in meeting varied demands, which otherwise would incur additional expenses.</description>

                Solar light&#8208;driven conversion of CO2 into chemicals with high calorific value is regarded as an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming carbon utilization technology for alleviating the energy crisis. This technique faces the challenge of low CO2 conversion and product yield due to charge recombination in the catalyst. In this paper, a dual&#8208;reaction&#8208;site heterojunction catalyst was designed and fabricated by combining NiO with Bi3O4Br nanosheets, for the separation of CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation semireactions, which effectively promoted electrons and holes separation. The resulting catalyst exhibited a high CH4 production rate (8.12 &#956;mol/g) and selectivity (94.69%). Electron distribution and band structure were investigated to explain the satisfactory catalytic performance. In addition, combining the in&#8208;situ DRIFTS results, a formic acid&#8208;intermediated CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reaction pathway was proposed. This work aims to pave the way for CH4 production via CO2 photoreduction with high efficiency and selectivity.</description>

                Abstract Resin concrete, which has high strength, high early strength development and excellent chemical resistance, has been widely applied for repair and reinforcement of concrete structures, and precast products since the 1950&#8217;s. The research and development of resin concrete in Japan have evolved in tandem with various regions and international activities. It is a common and indispensable material for infrastructures in the world at present. On the other hand, there are so many different Acts of God, such as earthquakes, typhoons, and torrential rains, that occur in Japan, and disaster measures are an important issue. In this paper, the current status and practical application of resin concrete mainly applied for sewage products in Japan were investigated and discussed. Based on the regional characteristics of Japan, a resin concrete manhole of high quality to compensate for the defects of cement concrete was developed. Furthermore, the future trends in the research and development of resin concrete including environmental issues such as carbon dioxide emissions reduction, application of recycled materials and bioplastics to replace natural aggregates and petroleum-derived resin for concrete are proposed and discussed. A homogenization analysis method is introduced particularly to bring out the ability of resin concrete as composite materials and to carry out material development efficiently.</description>

      <title>Substituent tuning of Cu coordination polymers enables carbon-efficient CO2 electroreduction to multi-carbon products</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54107-2</link>

                CO2 electroreduction is a potential pathway to achieve net-zero emissions in the chemical industry. Yet, CO2 loss, resulting from (bi)carbonate formation, renders the process energy-intensive. Acidic environments can address the issue but at the expense of compromised product Faradaic efficiencies (FEs), particularly for multi-carbon (C2+) products, as rapid diffusion and migration of protons (H+) favors competing H2 and CO production. Here, we present a strategy of tuning the 2-position substituent length on benzimidazole (BIM)-based copper (Cu) coordination polymer (CuCP) precatalyst &#8211; to enhance CO2 reduction to C2+ products in acidic environments. Lengthening the substituent from H to nonyl enhances H+ diffusion retardation and decreases Cu-Cu coordination numbers (CNs), favoring further reduction of CO. This leads to a nearly 24&#215; enhancement of selectivity towards CO hydrogenation and C-C coupling at 60 mA cm&#8722;2. We report the highest C2+ product FE of more than 70% at 260 mA cm&#8722;2 on pentyl-CuCP and demonstrate a CO2-to-C2+ single-pass conversion (SPC) of ~54% at 180 mA cm&#8722;2 using pentyl-CuCP in zero-gap electrolyzers. Acidic CO2 electroreduction suffers poor selectivity for multi-carbon products. Here, the authors report that lengthening the 2-position substituents of benzimidazole-based copper coordination polymer precatalysts retards H+ diffusion, reduces Cu-Cu coordination numbers, and promotes C-C coupling.</description>

      <title>Proton Pool for the Mitigation of Salt Precipitate Enhancing CO2 Electroreduction in a Flow Cell</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14110807</link>
      <description>Yuexiu Chen, Bowen Wu, Linping Qian, Catalysts. 14(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404254367

                Flow cells featuring a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) have emerged as an attractive platform for electrochemical CO2 reduction, offering high current densities (~300 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2) and low energy consumption. However, the formation of salt precipitates, particularly carbonate and bicarbonate, poses a significant deficiency by reducing the cell&#8217;s operational longevity. In this study, we present a novel approach to mitigate salt precipitates in real-time through acid&#8211;base interaction. Recovery efficiency and partial current density of the cell were used to evaluate the capability of removing salt precipitates and the maintenance of CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RRs). It was suggested that the direct treatment of intermittent acid rinse recovers the performance of CO2RRs to a large extent (&gt;97%), and the modification of the proton exchange resin reduces the reduction rate of partial current densities to 1/15 than that of the unmodified. This improvement enhances the cell&#8217;s catalytic performance, enabling the stability test for catalysts within the GDE-based flow cell.</description>

      <title>Production strategies for controlling greenhouse gas emissions in grass-fed beef production systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.55905/rdelosv17.n61-071</link>
      <description>Fagton de Mattos Negr&#227;o, Emerson Silva Miranda, Luciano da Silva Cabral, Luiz Juliano Val&#233;rio Geron, Alexandre Lima de Souza, Tayane Barbosa Pereira, Rodivaldo H. Cunha, M. Silva, DELOS Desarrollo Local Sostenible. 17(61)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404170317

                Looking at pasture-based beef cattle production systems, there needs to be more pasture management and low zootechnical indexes, which culminate in low productivity and environmental impact. In this sense, cattle farming has been labeled as harmful to the environment due to the emission of gases that can contribute to the excessive increase in the greenhouse effect. These gases are methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide, which come from ruminal fermentation, manure fermentation, and biomass management. The objective was to simulate eight scenarios: the first occurred in areas of degradation and desertification of pastures induced by livestock farming, the second occurred with the recovery of degraded pasture areas, the third occurred with the improvement of pasture management, the fourth occurred with the implementation of integrated production systems, the fifth occurred with the improvement in diet quality, the sixth occurred with the association of supplementation strategies for grazing cattle with fattening in confinement, the seventh occurred with the reduction in the feeding cycle production of beef cattle and the eighth occurred with the intensification of land use. It is concluded that the adoption of more intensive production systems proves to be more efficient, both productively and environmentally, by reducing the emission of greenhouse gases and improving zootechnical indices, guaranteeing the supply of animal protein in the face of growing demand globally.</description>

      <title>Experimental Analysis of Gas Injection Feasibility and Evaluation of Enhanced Recovery Potential in Mahu Tight Conglomerate Reservoirs</title>

                A series of development technologies of "horizontal well plus volume fracturing" have been established to achieve an annual output of one million tons of crude oil in 7 the Mahu tight conglomerate reservoir. However, such oil fields generally face problems such as rapid pressure drop, rapid production decline, difficulty in water injection, and gas channeling, seriously affecting the beneficial development of tight conglomerate reservoirs. To solve these problems, in this study, we carried out the feasibility experiment of different gas injection developments and the potential evaluation of enhanced oil recovery based on the combination of laboratory experiments and numerical simulation. The results show that CO2, rich gas, and dry gas can be miscible with crude oil in X oilfield under the original formation conditions. Both CO2 and hydrocarbon gas have expansion and viscosity reduction abilities. Under the same mole fraction of injected gas, the volume expansion ability and viscosity reduction ability of CO2 to crude oil are 2.14 and 2.25 times that of hydrocarbon gas, respectively. Numerical simulation results show that the well pattern suitable for gas injection and energy supplement is a vertical well injection and horizontal well production, and the angle between the horizontal well direction and the horizontal maximum principal stress direction is between 0&#176; and 30&#176;. Both laboratory experiments and numerical simulations show that the CO2 injection medium has the best recovery effect, which can increase the recovery rate by 13.8% compared with the depletion development. This research provides insights into the effective development of tight conglomerate reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Advanced Design of Naval Ship Propulsion Systems Utilizing Battery-Diesel Generator Hybrid Electric Propulsion Systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse12112034</link>

                As advanced sensors and weapons require high power, naval vessels have increasingly adopted electric propulsion systems. This study aims to enhance the efficiency and operability of electric propulsion systems over traditional mechanical propulsion systems by analyzing the operational profiles of modern naval vessels. Consequently, a battery-integrated generator-based electric propulsion system was selected. Considering the purpose of the vessel, a specification selection procedure was developed, leading to the design of a hybrid electric propulsion system (comprising one battery and four generators). The power management control technique of the proposed propulsion system sets the operating modes (depending on the specific fuel oil consumption of the generators) to minimize fuel consumption based on the operating load. Additionally, load distribution control rules for the generators were designed to reduce energy consumption based on the load and battery state of charge. MATLAB/Simulink was used to evaluate the proposed system, with simulation results demonstrating that it maintained the same propulsion performance as existing systems while achieving a 12-ton (22%) reduction in fuel consumption. This improvement results in cost savings and reduced carbon dioxide emissions. These findings suggest that an efficient load-sharing controller can be implemented for various vessels equipped with electric propulsion systems, tailored to their operational profiles.</description>

      <title>A Numerical and Experimental Study to Compare Different IAQ-Based Smart Ventilation Techniques</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14113555</link>

                Maintaining indoor environmental quality in residential buildings is essential for occupants&#8217; comfort, productivity, and health, with effective mechanical ventilation playing a key role in removing or diluting indoor pollutants. A two-week experimental campaign was conducted in an apartment in Lyon, France, known for its poor urban air quality, assessing temperature, relative humidity, CO2, and PM2.5 concentrations. A model verification study was performed to compare experimental measurements against numerical modeling in the living room and bedroom, leading to errors in the accuracy of the sensors. In addition, this study also investigates the impact of different ventilation strategies on indoor air quality. This research evaluates a baseline mechanical exhaust-only ventilation approach with constant air volume against two innovative smart ventilation approaches: mechanical exhaust-only ventilation with humidity control and mechanical exhaust-only ventilation with room-level CO2 and humidity control. A key contribution of this research is the novel coupling of multizone simulation models (DOMUS and CONTAM) with a CFD tool to refine pressure coefficients on the building fa&#231;ade, which enhances the accuracy of indoor air quality predictions. The smart ventilation strategies showed improvements, including a 20% reduction in CO2 concentration and a 5% reduction in the third-quartile PM2.5 concentration, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing ventilation and pollutant dilution. This research provides valuable insights into advanced ventilation strategies and modeling techniques in urban environments.</description>

                Biodiesel is a promising alternative fuel that represents a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy source. Due to its complete carbon cycle, it reduces dependence on fossil fuels and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. However, the use of biodiesel in diesel engines is associated with several challenges, including an increase in nitrogen oxide and particulate emissions, incompatibility with cold climates, and lower calorific value. By using nanoparticles as fuel additives, there is a potential to improve the properties of biodiesel and address its shortcomings. In this work, the characteristics of biodiesel derived from waste cooking oil have been enhanced using nanoparticle additives, which result in the usage of a higher percentage of the biodiesel in diesel engines. Nanoparticles of cerium oxide, silicon dioxide, and aluminum oxide have been investigated in different concentrations as biodiesel additives. Two mathematical models are introduced in this work and solved by LINGO optimization software (version 18); the first one seeks to predict the characteristics of biodiesel with nanoparticles in any blend of diesel&#8211;biodiesel&#8211;nanoparticles, while the second model aims to maximize the biodiesel ratio in a biodiesel&#8211;diesel&#8211;nanoparticles blend. The application of the combined two models aids in the selection of the optimal nanomaterial that improves the properties of biodiesel and permits an increase in the biodiesel mixing ratio in the fuel. The results show that the best nanoparticle type is cerium oxide at a concentration of 100 ppm, and the optimal mixing ratio of biodiesel blended with CeO2 nanoparticles is 24.892%. An unmodified diesel engine is operated and evaluated with the optimum blend (24.892% biodiesel + 75.108% petrol diesel + 100 ppm CeO2 nanoparticles). It is found that significant improvements in engine performance and emissions compared with the conventional diesel are achieved. The reductions in brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC), smoke opacity, and carbon monoxide emissions are 24%, 52%, and 30%, respectively.</description>

                Urea electrosynthesis from flue gas and NO3&#8208; under operating conditions represents a promising alternative technology to traditional energy&#8208;intensive industrial process. Herein, we explore a polyoxometalate confined synthesis strategy to prepare ultrafine BiVO4 nanocluster by pre&#8208;incorporating [V10O28]6&#8208; into NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;101&#8208;Al (MIL) framework. The resulting BiVO4@MIL&#8208;n can efficiently drive co&#8208;reduction of NO3&#8208; and CO2 to urea. A record urea yield of 63.4 mmol h&#8208;1 gcat&#8208;1 was achieved under CO2/O2 mixed gases (33% O2) atmosphere, and comparable performance can be obtained by feeding flue gas, demonstrating remarkable O2/N2 tolerance and potential feasibility for urea production under operating conditions. Systematic investigations revealed that MIL carrier with &#8208;NH2 group can enrich CO2, and BiVO4 nanocluster can reduce both NO3&#8208; and CO2 to ensure efficient urea synthesis even in the presence of O2. This work demonstrates the key role of in situ growth of BiVO4 nanocluster within a NH2&#8208;framework in facilitating urea electrosynthesis with exceptional tolerance to O2/N2.</description>

      <title>Impacts of mode shift on well-to-wheel emissions from inter-capital transport in Australia &#8211; Part I: Road and rail transport</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.36922/eer.3470</link>
      <description>Robin Smit, P G Boulter, No host. 1(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404116379

                Achieving mode shift in the transport sector will help Australia to meet its target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, although robust data on its effectiveness have previously been limited. This analysis provides valuable new information on mode shift impacts on emissions in Australia and demonstrates some recently developed assessment tools. The analysis considers the potential of a shift from road to rail to reduce well-to-wheel (WTW) emissions (as CO2-equivalents, CO2-e) in 2019, 2030, and 2050, specifically for a case study involving the transport of passengers and freight between Brisbane and Melbourne. The analysis provides emission intensities (EIs) in grams per passenger-km (g/pkm) and grams per tonne-km (g/tkm), as well as annualized emissions, and considers the variability and uncertainty in the estimates using a probabilistic approach. The transfer of passengers and freight from road to rail has the potential to significantly reduce emissions. Electric rail delivers the largest and least uncertain emission reductions. For passenger transport, the EI of electric rail (12 g CO2-e/pkm in 2030; 6.5 g CO2-e/pkm in 2050) is considerably lower than that of road transport (143.2 g CO2-e/pkm in 2030; 58.9 g CO2-e/pkm in 2050), and the uncertainty is lower. For freight transport, the EI of electric rail (8.6 g CO2-e/tkm in 2030; 5.0 CO2-e/tkm in 2050) is also substantially lower than that for road transport (48.3 g CO2-e/tkm in 2030; 29.5 g CO2-e/tkm in 2050). The EI for diesel rail freight (27.0 g CO2-e/tkm in 2030; 26.1 g CO2-e/tkm in 2050) is around half of the value for road transport in 2030, but road transport becomes more competitive by 2050. The complete transfer of passengers between Brisbane and Melbourne from road to electric rail would reduce annual WTW emissions for passenger transport by 75 &amp;ndash; 90%, depending on the year. The complete transfer of freight from road to diesel rail would reduce annual emissions by 45% in 2019 and 2030 and by 10% in 2050. The study and tools will help researchers, policymakers, transport/land-use planners, and network operators to quantify, design, and implement mode shift measures to reduce emissions.</description>

      <title>Putting the costs and benefits of Carbon Capture and Storage into perspective: A multi-sector to multi-product analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/2516-1083/ad9075</link>
      <description>Simon Roussanaly, Truls Gundersen, Andrea Ram&#237;rez, Progress in Energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404167682

                Abstract Carbon dioxide capture, transport, and storage (CCS) is essential in achieving the net-zero target. Despite this increasing recognition, current CCS deployments are far behind targeted ambitions. A key reason is that CCS is often perceived as too expensive. While assessments of the costs of CCS have traditionally looked at impact at the plant level, the present study seeks to understand the costs and environmental benefits that will be passed to consumers via end-products and services. In particular, nine end-products/services (bridge construction, electricity from onshore wind power, electricity from offshore wind power, transport of a container via ship, a magazine, the production and transport of an avocado, a beer can, waste treatment via waste-to-energy, and long-distance air travel) connected to ten potential areas of application for CCS (cement production, iron and steel production, oil and gas production, natural gas processing, refining, ship propulsion engines, pulp and paper production, urea production, waste-to-energy, and direct air capture).&amp;#xD;The evaluations highlight that significant emission reductions (beyond 50 %) could be achieved at marginal costs for end-users in six end-products/services: bridge construction, electricity from onshore wind power, electricity from offshore wind power, transport by ship, magazine, and waste treatment. Moderate emission reductions (between 11 and 37%) could be achieved in two cases at virtually no cost (increase below 1%): beer can and avocado production. Finally, only the case of using direct air capture to compensate for emissions from air travel was found to raise the cost for end-users significantly.&amp;#xD;Although more research is still needed in this area, this work broadens our understanding of the real cost and benefits of CCS and provides useful insights for decision-makers and society.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Estimation of CO2 Absorption Capacity Using Ionic Conductivity of Protonated Di-Methyl-Ethanolamine (DMEA) and Electrical Conductivity in Low-Concentration DMEA Aqueous Solutions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12112495</link>
      <description>Sang&#8208;Jun Han, Jin Han, Jung&#8208;Ho Wee, Processes. 12(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404243901

                The present study investigates the real-time estimation of CO2 absorption capacity (CAC) based on the electrical conductivity (EC) of low-concentration di-methyl-ethanolamine (DMEA) solutions (0.1&#8211;0.5 M). CO2 absorption experiments are conducted to measure the variation in CAC and EC during CO2 absorption, revealing a strong correlation between the two properties. The ionic conductivity of DMEAH+ formed during absorption is calculated to be 53.1 S&#183;cm2/(mol&#183;z), which is found to be larger than that of TEAH+ and MDEAH+. This can be attributed to the smaller molar mass and higher ionic mobility of DMEAH+. A significant finding is that the measured EC (ECM) of the DMEA solutions consistently demonstrates a lower value than the theoretically predicted value. This discrepancy is due to the larger ionic size of DMEAH+, which results in a reduction in the real mean ionic activity coefficient. This effect becomes more pronounced with increasing DMEA concentration. Consequently, a higher CAC is required to produce the same change in EC at higher amine concentrations. Based on these findings, an empirical equation is devised to estimate CAC from ECM in solutions of constant DMEA concentration. This equation will be employed as a practical approach for the in situ monitoring of CO2 absorption using DMEA aqueous solution.</description>

                Precise synthesis of carboxylic acids via catalytic carboxylation with CO2 is highly appealing. Although considerable advancements have been achieved in difunctionalizing carboxylation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, the asymmetric variants are conspicuously underdeveloped, particularly in addressing axially chiral alkenes. Herein, we report the first catalytic atroposelective carboxylation of alkynes with CO2. A variety of valuable axially chiral carboxylic acids are obtained with good yields and high chemo&#8208;, regio&#8208;, E/Z and enantio&#8208;selectivities. Notably, an unexpected anti&#8208;selective carbo&#8208;carboxylation is observed in the sp2&#8208;hybrid carbo&#8208;electrophile&#8208;initiated reductive carboxylation of alkynes.

                Abstract Although tobacco smoking declined among men at reproductive age, the use of cannabis increased. The aim of our study was to determine the impact of tobacco and cannabis on sperm quality, sperm DNA integrity tested by Chromomycin A3 (CMA3) and acridine orange (AO) and their association to genetic variants in the Cytochrome C Oxidase 1, 2 and 3 genes (MT-CO1, MT-CO2, and MT-CO3). Semen samples were collected and divided into 37 non-smokers (NS), 39 tobacco smokers (TS), and 37 cannabis smokers (CS). MT-CO1, MT-CO2 and MT-CO3 genes were amplified by PCR and sequenced by Sanger. The results showed reductions in normal sperm morphology and non-progressive motility in TS and CS compared to NS (p &lt; 0.001). However, immotile sperm, AO+, and CMA3 + scores were higher in the CS compared to TS and NS (p &lt; 0.001). Twenty-three nucleotide substitutions (SNPs) detected in the MT-CO1 gene, 15 SNPs detected in the MT-CO2 gene, and 30 SNPs detected in the MT-CO3 gene. None of these SNPs was different between the three groups. Tobacco and cannabis smoking altered the motility and morphology of the spermatozoa and sperm DNA integrity but was not associated with genetic variants in the MT-CO1, MT-CO2 and MT-CO3 genes.</description>

      <title>Sulfur-Doped Carbon Support Boosts CO2RR Activity of Ag Electrocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2172/2475914</link>
      <description>Xingyi Deng, Dominic Alfonso, Thuy Nguyen Phan, Douglas R. Kauffman, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404128418

                For presentation at the 70th AVS International Symposium and Exhibition. In this work, we show that the activity of Ag electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2 to CO conversion is improved when supported on sulfur-doped (S-doped) carbon materials. S-doped carbon support was created by treating the heavily sputtered, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) in H2S at elevated temperatures, as confirmed by the S 2p X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) peak. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images indicated that Ag nanoparticles supported on S-doped HOPG had similar size distributions as those supported on sulfur-free (S-free) HOPG. While both catalysts reached &gt; 90% CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) at E = -1.3 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), Ag catalysts supported on S-doped HOPG demonstrated 70% higher CO turnover frequency (TOFCO = 3.4 CO/atomAg/s) than those supported on S-free HOPG (TOFCO = 2.0 CO/atomAg/s). Preliminary calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) indicated a more favorable energetic pathway of CO2-to-CO at the C-S-Ag interface, tentatively consistent with experiments. These results hint at a new approach to design active and selective electrocatalysts for CO2 conversion.</description>

      <title>Sex differences in the cardiopulmonary and neuromuscular response to high-intensity interval exercise</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.08.622119</link>
      <description>Hannah Wilson, Lina Bernert, P&#225;draig Spillane, Emma Squires, Lori Crawford, Jessica Piasecki, Ross Julian, Eurico Nestor Wilhelm, Kirsty M. Hicks, Paul Ansdell, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404229910

                Sex differences exist in the integrative response to exercise, however, these are typically researched during constant-load exercise. Interval exercise involves high-intensity efforts interspersed with recovery periods to repeatedly stress physiological systems, and it is currently unknown whether the response to this form of exercise differs between sexes. Ten males and ten females (age: 25 +/- 3 years) completed two experimental visits. First, an incremental treadmill exercise test was performed to obtain submaximal (lactate threshold) and maximal (VO2peak) data. Thereafter, visit two involved 4 x 3-min running intervals at 90% of the final incremental test velocity (vVO2peak), with 90 secs rest between intervals. Before exercise and after each interval, maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), quadriceps potentiated twitch (Qtw.pot), and voluntary activation (VA) were recorded. The rates of oxygen uptake (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2) and ventilation (VE) were continuously recorded throughout. There was no sex difference in relative VO2peak (males: 47.2 +/- 6.0 vs. females: 44.4 +/- 5.8 ml.kg-1.min-1, p=0.292). When expressed relative to peak values, there were no sex differences in the VO2 or VCO2 response to the interval task (p greater than or equal to 0.781). Females had greater VE, VE/VO2, and VE/VCO2 values during the first two intervals (p less than or equal to 0.046). There were no sex differences in the reductions in MVC, Qtw.pot, and VA during the interval task (p greater than or equal to 0.150), however females had lesser reductions in Qtw.pot values post-exercise (-24 +/- 9 vs. -15 +/- 8%, p=0.044). Sex differences exist in the physiological response to interval exercise. Compared to males, females experienced greater hyperpnoea during the initial stages, and had lesser decreases in contractile function post-exercise.</description>

      <title>AN OVERVIEW OF ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND CO2 EMISSIONS IN IRAN'S RESIDENTIAL SECTOR: ENERGY TRANSITION AND SUBSIDY POLICIES</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.53277/2519-2442-2024.4-04</link>
      <description>Behnam Ata, Eurasian Research Journal. 6(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404213627

                The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources has become a critical global issue, particularly in response to climate change. This study aims to analyse the trends in energy consumption and CO2 emissions within Iran's household sector. The findings reveal a significant increase in energy consumption in Iran between 2001 and 2019. Despite the household sector's heavy reliance on fossil fuels, a shift in fuel consumption patterns can be observed, with a transition from oil to natural gas starting in 2008. Electricity generation in Iran is also predominantly fossil fuel-based, with natural gas playing a major role. This underscores the urgent need to reinforce renewable energy sources to mitigate CO2 emissions from the household sector. Another key factor influencing energy consumption in Iran is the country's extensive energy subsidies. The disparity in fuel prices compared to neighbouring countries has also led to fuel smuggling. However, the results show that the twophase subsidy reform plan implemented in 2010 and 2013 did not lead to a reduction in energy consumption. Therefore, further reforms are needed to improve energy equity and reduce CO2 emissions in the household sector.</description>

Small modular reactors (SMRs) and renewable energy such as wind and solar represent an interesting alternative for the decarbonization of the energy sector. This study aims to investigate the possibility of establishing a grid-connected hybrid energy system (Grid/Solar PV/Wind Turbine/BESS/SMRs) to fulfill the energy demand of Phuket Island in Thailand and to minimize net present cost (NPC), levelized cost of energy (LCOE), and greenhouse gas (CO2) emissions. A grid-connected hybrid renewable generation system was simulated using HOMER. Four combinations of grid-connected and renewable energy sources were developed based on the electricity demand and renewable resources available at the site. The simulation results indicate that the most optimal scenario is the Grid/PV/WT/SMR system, which offers a 28% reduction in NPC and LCOE compared to the grid-only system and reduces CO2 emissions by over 58% compared to the total emissions from the utility grid. The simulation results demonstrate that the grid-connected and hybrid energy system is the most viable option to meet electricity demand and reduce greenhouse gas emissions on Phuket Island.</description>

                Soil mineralization is a crucial soil process that improves soil physical properties, enhances carbon sequestration, and provides essential minerals and available nutrients for plant growth. This study was conducted at five vegetation types and soil depths at Luot mountain area, located in VNUF campus, Hanoi city. Samples were incubated in the dark at 25&#176;C and measured at intervals of 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 35, and 40 days in the laboratory to determine C-CO2 respiration from soils. The study showed that CO2 emissions were highest in topsoils and decreased with deeper soil depths. Mineralized C-CO2 decreased from Shrubs &gt; Acacia + Native species (NS) &gt; Pinus + NS &gt; Native species &gt; Control. CO2 emissions peaked early in the incubation period and then stabilized in the 40-day incubation period. Larger aggregates (&#8805; 5mm) decreased significantly under most vegetation types, except for Shrubs, where the reduction was minimal. Aggregate size &#8805;3mm increased post-incubation, notably under Pinus + NS and Native species, with smaller aggregates also increasing slightly. Organic matter content was highest in the topsoil but decreased post-incubation due to microbial C mineralization. There was an increase in soil organic matter at 10-20 cm and 20-40 cm layers after incubation, especially under Shrubs. Available nitrogen slightly increased in soils post-incubation for most vegetation types. Phosphorus content increased post-incubation, peaking under Shrubs, while potassium levels were generally poor but increased during incubation. The study found that C-CO2 mineralization was strongly associated with soil porosity and pH, suggesting that higher porosity and optimal pH enhance mineralization, with organic matter content being crucial for available nutrient cycles in soils.</description>

                The use of renewable solar energy for the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has garnered significant interest owing to its dual benefits: reducing the greenhouse effect and producing high-energy alternatives to fossil fuels. Transition metals play a crucial role in catalyzing the CO2RR; however, their scarcity and high cost pose challenges in achieving sustainable chemistry. In this study, we developed a metal-free CO2RR catalytic system using triazolium, a small and structurally simple compound, as the key catalyst. Visible-light irradiation of a solution containing a carbazole photosensitizer and triazolium salt under 1 atm pressure of CO2 afforded formate in high yield at room temperature. No other reduced products of CO2 were detected. The turnover number of the catalyst exceeded 2300, indicating high catalytic activity and durability. Mechanistic studies revealed that the triazolium salt serves as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst, with a carbon-centered radical as the catalytically active species. A study on the relationship between the chemical structure and the catalytic activity of various triazolium analogs elucidated the essential structural properties required for carbon-centered HAT catalysts. The results provide valuable insights for future research on CO2RR utilizing transition metal-free organic molecules as catalysts, which could contribute to environmentally friendly and sustainable methods.</description>

                Environmental degradation remains a significant global challenge, particularly in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries. This study primarily examines the impact of Islamic finance, proxied by two indicators, namely Islamic financial assets and Islamic banking financing, and other variables including Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), urbanization, renewable energy adoption, and forest area, on CO2 emissions. This study revealed that Islamic financial assets had a negative impact on CO2 emissions, highlighting their importance in supporting green investments and sustainability. However, Islamic banking financing has little influence on emissions reduction, most likely due to carbon-intensive initiatives. Furthermore, GDP growth increases emissions, although FDI, urbanization, and forest areas help to lower them. These findings underscore Islamic finance's critical role in fostering sustainable development, as well as the necessity for better green Islamic financing policies in OIC member nations. The findings also provide important insights for policymakers working to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability in Islamic finance.</description>

      <title>Carbon dioxide capture in large-scale CCGT power plant from flue gases obtained from various fuel mixtures</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.24425/ather.2024.151999</link>
      <description>Navaneethan Subramanian, Pawe&#322; Madejski, Archives of Thermodynamics. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404276961

                In this study, the thermodynamic analysis of a combined cycle gas turbine integrated with post-combustion carbon capture and storage using the solvent method is performed. The syngas obtained from the gasification of sewage sludge is mixed with methane and nitrogen-rich natural gas fuels at different proportions, used in the gas turbine, and the properties of fuel and flue gases are analyzed. The flue gas obtained from the fuel mixture is passed through the post-combustion carbon capture and storage at various load conditions to assess the heat and electricity required for the carbon capture process. The solvent used for the carbon capture from flue gases enables CO2 capture with the high efficiency of 90%. With the calculated results, the load conditions of flue gas using fuel mixtures are identified, which reduces the heat and power demand of post-combustion carbon capture and storage and provides the possibility to achieve neutral emission. The impact of selected operating conditions of post-combustion carbon capture and storage on the CO2 emission reduction process and on the power plant performances is investigated. Considering the factors of electricity generation, energy efficiency, heat supply to the consumers, operating load of post-combustion carbon cap-ture and storage and CO2 emission, the 50% mixture of syngas with both fuels performs better. Also, the use of a mixture of 2-amino-2methyl-1-propanol and piperazine with reboiler duty 3.7 MJ/kgCO2 in post-combustion carbon capture and storage slightly enhanced the performance of the power plant compared to the use of monoethanolamine with reboiler duty 3.8 MJ/kgCO2.</description>

      <title>Cold Plasma Techniques for Sustainable Material Synthesis and Climate Change Mitigation: A Review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14110802</link>
      <description>Nitesh Joshi, L. Sivachandiran, Catalysts. 14(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404283665

                In recent years, the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) has increased significantly, contributing to global warming. Among these GHGs, CH4, CO2, and CO are particularly potent contributors. Remediation techniques primarily rely on materials capable of capturing, storing, and converting these gases. Catalytic processes, particularly heterogeneous catalysis, are essential to chemical and petrochemical industries as well as environmental remediation. Due to the growing demand for catalysts, efforts are being made to reduce energy consumption and make technologies more environmentally friendly. Green chemistry emphasizes minimizing the use of hazardous reactants and harmful solvents in chemical processes. Achieving these principles should be paired with processes that reduce time and costs in catalyst preparation while improving their efficiency. Non-thermal plasma (NTP) has been widely used for the preparation of supported metal catalysts. NTP has attracted significant attention for its ability to improve the physicochemical properties of catalysts, enhancing process efficiency through low-temperature operation and shorter processing times. NTP has been applied to various catalyst synthesis techniques, including reduction, oxidation, metal oxide doping, surface etching, coating, alloy formation, surface treatment, and surface cleaning. Plasma-prepared transition-metal catalysts offer advantages over conventionally prepared catalysts due to their unique material properties. These properties enhance catalytic activity by lowering the activation energy barrier, improving stability, and increasing conversion and selectivity compared to untreated samples. This review demonstrates how plasma activation modifies material properties and, based on extensive literature, illustrates its potential to combat climate change by converting CO2, CH4, CO, and other gases, showcasing the benefits of plasma-treated materials and catalysts. A succinct introduction to this review outlines the advantages of plasma-based synthesis and modification over traditional synthesis techniques. The introduction also highlights the various types of plasma and their physical characteristics across different factors. Additionally, this review addresses methods by which materials are synthesized and modified using plasma. The latter section of this review discusses the use of non-thermal plasma for greenhouse gas mitigation, covering applications such as the dry reforming of CH4, CO and CH4 oxidation, CO2 reduction, and other uses of plasma-modified catalysts.</description>

      <title>Plasma chemistry modelling for the conversion of CO2 and CH4 into value-added chemicals under atmospheric pressure plasma conditions</title>

                Global CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have reached unprecedented levels, driven primarily by anthropogenic emissions. This alarming rise in greenhouse gases (GHGs) presents a significant challenge to global climate stability, with CO2 being the primary contributor to climate change. Industrial activities are major sources of these emissions, highlighting the urgent need for innovative and sustainable solutions. Plasma technology emerges as particularly promising, which creates a highly reactive environment through the presence of high-energy electrons. By leveraging such processes, CO2 can be transformed into useful chemicals, contributing to both emissions reduction and resource circularity. One interesting reaction, which can be carried out in a plasma environment, is the dry reforming of methane (DRM), a process that utilizes CO2 and methane (CH4) to produce a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2). These are valuable intermediates for further chemical synthesis, which can be used to synthesize a variety of chemicals and fuels. Through chemical kinetics modelling a wide range of conditions is explored to better understand the core chemical kinetics of DRM in warm plasmas. Thereby examining the performance of the process across a wide temperature range and highlighting the limitations of various gas mixtures. The findings demonstrate where plasma-specific kinetics diverges from thermal gas-phase chemistry, offering new insights into the unique behaviour of plasma-driven reactions. Also, the effect of nitrogen (N2) on plasma-based DRM is investigated through computational modelling to support experimental results and demonstrate the role of N2 in the conversion process within a gliding arc plasmatron (GAP) reactor. Revealing a small fraction of N2 can improve the process. Furthermore, after the plasma has converted the gas molecules, further chemical changes can still occur, influencing the overall efficiency and product distribution. The model demonstrates that quenching the gas temperature does not generally improve performance, except in CO2-rich mixtures where certain reactions are influenced by the cooling process, leading to notable changes in the product distribution. The benefits of combining the hot plasma effluent with unconverted gas are also explored, as the residual heat from the plasma can be reused to drive additional reactions, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the process. The findings presented improve the understanding of plasma-based DRM technology, forming a foundation for further experimental and theoretical studies, and contribute to the broader goal of reducing GHG emissions and supporting the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future.</description>

      <title>The Electrooxidation of Synthetic Bipyridyl Herbicide Wastewaters with Boron-Doped Diamond Electrodes: A Technical and Economic Study to Boost Their Application for Pollution Prevention in the Agricultural Sector</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12112486</link>
      <description>El&#237;a Alejandra Teutli-Sequeira, Rub&#233;n V&#225;squez-Medrano, Dorian Prato-Garc&#237;a, Jorge G. Ib&#225;&#241;ez, Processes. 12(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404281990

                Boron-doped diamond electrodes (BDDEs) offer a highly efficient pathway to mineralize recalcitrant compounds due to their reduced energy requirements, fewer chemical inputs, and mechanical stability. In this work, the electrochemical degradation of paraquat (PQ) and diquat (DQ) was studied using an undivided cell (Condiacell&#174;-type) at circumneutral pH, and under galvanostatic control. The roles of applied current density, volumetric flow rate, and herbicide concentration were systematically studied through a central composite design (CCD) using a closed-flow reaction setup. Under the best operating conditions (i.e., for PQ: 1.6 mA/cm2, 80 mL/min, and 70 mL/min, and 70 mg/L; and for DQ: 1.5 mA/cm2, 80 mL/min, and 73 mg/L), a spectrophotometric analysis evidenced that the herbicides were satisfactorily removed (ca. 100%) while mineralization degrees were above 90%. Furthermore, the produced effluents yielded significant increases in seed germination and root length, which suggest a reduction in toxicity. Energy consumptions of 0.13 and 0.18 kWh/g of TOC are reported with the electrochemical cells for the PQ and DQ treatments, respectively. The PQ and DQ treatments by electrooxidation are estimated to emit nearly 2.7 and 38.9 kg CO2/m3 of water treated, with a cost around USD 250/m3. Carbon emissions could be greatly decreased for PQ (0.28 kg CO2/m3) and DQ (0.40 kg CO2/m3) if electricity were generated from renewable resources. Although this study suggests that the use of BDDE can be considered as a green alternative for agrochemical removal due to lower carbon emissions, the environmental profile of the process is determined by the degree of renewability of the electrical grid of each country or region.</description>

                This study aims to assess the capability of using a specially designed device to monitor changes in gas concentration (CO2, NH3, H2S, and O2) in the atmosphere above the minced beef meat, during storage at refrigerated temperature. With its array of sensing channels, the multi-gas detector device facilitates the detection of precise gas concentrations in sensitive environments, enabling the monitoring of various processes occurring within stored meat. To delve into the connection between microbial activity and gas emissions during storage, fluctuations in microbial populations in the meat were observed, focusing on prevalent meat microbiota such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Enterobacteriaceae. A significant reduction of O2 content in the stored samples was observed after seven days (p &lt; 0.05), while a significant release of CO2 was detected on the fourth day of storage. Significant changes (p &lt; 0.05) in the gas content were tracked until the 11th day of storage followed by intensive microbial growth. NH3 and H2S levels remained undetectable throughout the experiment. The results showed a correlation between an increase in gas content in the headspace and an increase in the number of LAB and Enterobacteriaceae in meat. Modern multi-gas detector devices can indirectly determine microbial contamination in closed meat packaging.</description>

      <title>Rising atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations: the overlooked factor promoting SW Iberian Forest development across the LGM and the last deglaciation?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-3334</link>
      <description>Sandra Domingues Gomes, William Fletcher, Abi Stone, Teresa Rodrigues, Andreia Rebotim, Dulce Oliveira, Mar&#305;&#769;a Fernanda S&#225;nchez Go&#241;i, Fatima F Abrantes, Filipa Naughton, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404119723

                Abstract. Across the last deglaciation, the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (pCO2) increased from ~180 to ~280 ppm. However, the impact of pCO2 changes on vegetation across the last deglaciation remains poorly understood. Under full glacial low pCO2, plants experienced constraints on photosynthesis. Therefore, a significant reduction in pCO2 limitation should have impacted local and regional vegetation dynamics across deglaciation. We hypothesise that deglacial pCO2 rise could have (1) led to a gradual reduction of the physiological constraint promoting forest response when moisture availability was sufficient, despite low temperatures; and (2) amplified the response of forest development to warmer and wetter conditions. The high-resolution analysis of terrestrial (pollen, C29:C31 organic biomarker) and marine (alkenone-derived Sea Surface Temperature, C37: 4%, and long-chain n-alkanes ratios) indicators, using a direct land-sea direct comparison, in the Iberian margin site Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) U1385 ("Shackleton site") throughout the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and last deglaciation allowed us to track and compare the changes with shifts in global pCO2. The LGM is characterised by a grassland-heathland mosaic type ecosystem, triggered by cool and moderately humid conditions but low pCO2 levels may have exacerbated physiological drought and suppressed forest development. During Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1)the coldest and most arid conditions combined with sustained low pCO2 values precluded forest development and resulted in the dominance of Mediterranean steppe or semi-desert vegetation. The B&#248;lling-Aller&#248;d (BA) is characterised by a temperature optimum (warmest SSTs and forest development) and variable moisture condition, while increasing pCO2 which contributed to the highest levels of forest development. Within the BA, significant SW Iberian forest development occurred at ~15 cal kyr B.P. associated with an increase in pCO2 above 225 ppm. During the Younger Dryas (YD), cool temperatures combined with sufficient moisture availability allowed the maintenance of a grassland-forest mosaic, the increasing values of pCO2 in this period should have offset the low temperature as well as the moisture levels and allow the forest to persist. The overlooked role of pCO2 could explain an intriguing feature observed in Site U1385 and other Iberian margin records, namely the near absence of forest during the LGM and HS1 but relatively high forest cover during the YD. Our study aims to shed light on the influence of climatic factors (temperature and moisture availability) together with pCO2 as thresholds on forest response to deglacial climate changes across the Iberian Peninsula.</description>

      <title>A Cybernetic Delay Analysis of the Energy&#8211;Economy&#8211;Emission Nexus in India via a Bistage Operational Amplifier Network</title>

                In analyzing the decoupling of emissions from economic growth, current literature foregoes the nonlinear complexities of macroeconomic systems, leading to ineffective energy transition policies, specifically for developing countries. This study focuses on the Indian energy&#8211;economy&#8211;emission nexus to establish a control system that internalizes inflation, trade openness, and fossil fuel imports with economic growth and macro-emissions to visualize the complex pathways of decoupling. Through long-term cointegration and vector error correction modeling, it was found that GDP and energy affect capital, inflation and energy imports, which are locked in a long-run negative feedback loop that ultimately increases emissions. Capital growth enables decoupling at 0.7% CO2 emissions reduction for every 1% capital growth, while 1% inflation growth inhibits decoupling by increasing CO2 emissions by 0.8%. A cybernetic fractional circuit of R-C elements and operational amplifiers was utilized to examine the delay of pulses from GDP to the loop elements, which revealed that capital is periodic with GDP pulses. However, inflation, being aperiodic with the clock pulses of GDP, causes the pulse-width of capital to decrease and fossil fuel imports to increase. Through the circuital model, it was possible to determine the exact policy intervention schedule in business cycle growth and recession phases that could build clean energy capital and limit inflation-induced recoupling.</description>

                With renewables growing at an unprecedented pace and critical carbon budget deadlines approaching, research is shifting to the new frontier of Paris aligned 1.5 &#176;C mitigation pathways for hard-to-abate sectors, including the chemical industry sector. This is a significant challenge with chemical products such as plastics, fertilizers and many more products intertwined with today's society and with CO2 emissions originating both from energy and from chemical conversions. This paper presents a detailed bottom-up production-based energy and emission calculation to make a 1.5 &#176;C compatible scenario for the chemical industry based on three main measures compared to a business-as-usual scenario. This research found that the holistic combination of demand and supply measures is critical to reduce the different types of emissions in the sector (energy and non-energy process emissions). An overall reduction of 82% of CO2 emissions in 2050 is calculated with a decrease in base chemical production growth (&#8722; 21%), 100% renewable energy for heat and electricity (&#8722; 50%) and the introduction of novel electrical-based and biomass-based production technologies for ethylene, propylene, methanol and ammonia (&#8722; 10%). Critical system developments include slowing chemical demand growth with recycling and circularity best practices, advanced electrification of heat supply and the substantial market penetration of the current most advanced sustainable production technologies for methanol, ammonia, and ethylene based on their reasonable technology maturation trajectories. Here, green methanol and ammonia will require 381 TWh in 2030 and 3232 TWh in 2050 for green hydrogen electrolysis, which will represent 1% and 4% of global electricity demand.</description>

                As global climate change accelerates, the need for precise and high-resolution carbon emission inventories becomes increasingly urgent, particularly in rapidly developing regions. This study introduces an advanced methodology for constructing regional-scale gridded anthropogenic CO2 emission inventories, integrating the latest energy consumption data and remote sensing technologies. By systematically calculating emissions across various sectors and energy types, and utilizing Geographic Information System (GIS) for spatial distribution, we have generated a high-resolution emission map with a 1 km &#215; 1 km grid. The accuracy of the map was validated through regression analysis with the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) dataset, ensuring its reliability. This work provides critical insights for targeted emission reduction strategies, contributing to the formulation of sustainable development policies that align with global climate objectives.</description>

      <title>Impact of Urban Form in the Yangtze River Delta of China on the Spatiotemporal Evolution of Carbon Emissions from Transportation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16229678</link>
      <description>Yanming Sun, Baozhong Chen, Qingli Li, Sustainability. 16(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404106598

                The impact of urban form on carbon emissions has become a crucial issue for sustainable socioeconomic development and the advancement of low-carbon cities. Transportation is a significant source of urban carbon emissions, highlighting the need for comprehensive research to aid China in achieving its carbon peak and neutrality goals. Currently, there is a lack of quantitative studies exploring the effects of urban form on transportation-related carbon emissions. This paper seeks to quantify the effect of urban form on the spatial and temporal patterns of transportation carbon emissions, utilizing panel data from 27 cities in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China, covering the years 2000 to 2020. First, CO2 emissions from transportation are estimated following IPCC guidelines, with Moran&#8217;s I utilized to analyze spatial autocorrelation. Next, urban form indicators are quantified based on landscape ecology theory. Finally, econometric models are employed for regression analysis of the panel data. The findings reveal that urban complexity, compactness, and expansion influence transportation carbon emissions to varying degrees, with urban expansion and complexity associated with increased emissions, while compactness contributes to their reduction. This study offers theoretical support and a scientific basis for low-carbon urban spatial planning and development, underscoring the importance of urban form in emissions reduction strategies.</description>

These transitions can be technologically significant. For example, the classes of materials used in photovoltaics, or the use of fuel cells versus batteries in vehicle electrification. These transitions can also be more subtle and highlight shifts in perspectives the field is bringing toward research problems.I joined ACS Energy Letters as an editor in 2018, and in the past few years I started to notice a change in the focus of papers submitted to and published by the journal in the area of CO2 electroreduction. While there is not agreement on whether CO2 electroreduction will be broadly deployed, there has been consistent interest from the field of energy researchers. The shift I noticed is not from one chemistry to another (although the specific products of interest have evolved) but a switch in the perspective of researchers.To look into this shift in perspective, I searched all papers published by ACS Energy Letters since 2018 with the keyword "CO2 reduction" and focused on papers examining electrochemical reactions, processes, and systems. I categorized the papers as focusing on one of the following aspects of CO2 electroreduction technology:1.Catalyst: At the active site, often presenting new catalyst materials, new synthetic methods for catalysts, characterization of the active site, surface reaction mechanisms, etc.2.Environment: The environment where the chemistry occurs, discussing the role of pH, electrolyte, additive layers, flow rates, temperatures, chemical potentials, etc.3.Process: A process systems perspective focusing on how to assemble electrochemical reactors, flow patterns, bulk resistance losses, scale up viability, overall performance, etc.These classifications fall in the areas of catalyst, reaction, and process or systems science and engineering that are common to the scale up of chemical conversion processes.The compiled group of 167 papers results from the publication of &#8764;20&#8211;30 papers per year in ACS Energy Letters over 7 years, demonstrating consistent interest in the field (see Supporting Information). After categorizing the papers, the shift in perspective I sensed became clear, as seen in Figure 1. From 2018 to 2024, the number of papers focused on studies of the catalyst in CO2 electroreduction decreased from 18 to 4, or from 75% to 18% of the total papers published on the topic. Alternatively, the number of papers focused on the environment where the chemistry occurs increased from 2 to 9, or from 8 to 40% of the papers. The data in Figure 1 suggests that this change in topical focus occurred steadily over the past 6 years. Papers focused on the CO2 electroreduction process have remain consistent.Figure 1Figure 1. % of published papers on CO2 electroreduction published in ACS Energy Letters categorized based on their topical focus: Process, Catalyst, Environment, or Mixed (see text for explanations) since 2018. The papers were identified by searching all papers published in ACS Energy Letters for "CO2 reduction" and only categorizing those that focus on electroreduction.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThe shift in perspective of researchers on CO2 electroreduction from the active catalyst site to the environment where the reaction occurs is apparent from the data. It is interesting to consider what may have driven this change. The U.S. Department of Energy published a document in 2017 that summarized Basic Research Needs in Catalysis Science and highlighted the role of catalyst design "beyond the binding site"&#9472;this seems consistent? (1) It is also reasonable to consider that early discoveries of electrocatalysts that enabled high selectivity for specific products at low current densities motivated studies at higher current densities where mass, heat, and electron transport can dictate performance. Clearly, this would also shift the focus of researchers to the environment around the binding site. Perhaps this trend is just the natural development of new energy technologies where a physical/chemical process is envisioned, initial material discovery is performed, and then analysis of increasing system time and length scales is performed in attempts to scale up. But it is interesting to wonder if the focus on active site design will push the field forward further than the design of the environment around the site.So, what did I learn from this retrospective analysis? My editorial is not meant to comment on the potential viability of CO2 electroreduction, but instead to try to learn from how an intensely studied research topic evolves. The results seem to suggest that researchers who can think broadly about a topic area, who do not follow the common approach of the field and instead focus efforts from a different perspective, may end up having the longest lasting impact on the field. However, this can be hard as funding agencies, journals and referees may not recognize a new perspective as useful if it is not the current norm. But it seems that research papers that bring new viewpoints to problems of broad interest are likely to be the most impactful and have the potential to shift the perspective of the field.Supporting InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!The Supporting Information is available free of charge at https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsenergylett.4c02907.Focus on electroreduction of CO2 (and CO), excluding photo- and thermochemical approaches &#8211; original articles and perspectives (XLSX)nz4c02907_si_001.xlsx (27.17 kb) Terms &amp; Conditions Most electronic Supporting Information files are available without a subscription to ACS Web Editions.

      <title>Design of Integrated Energy&#8211;Water Systems Using Automated Targeting Modeling Considering the Energy&#8211;Water&#8211;Carbon Nexus</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/w16223256</link>
      <description>Nor Erniza Mohammad Rozali, Muhammad Aidan Mohd Halmy, Peng Yen Liew, Water. 16(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404258011

                The swift expansion of the global population and economy has spurred growing requirements for energy and water in recent decades. Inefficient energy and water consumption, however, has led to an increase in CO2 emissions. Hence, the socio-economic development of a country must consider the interconnections between energy, water and carbon, as there are mutual dependencies among these three elements. This work considers the nexus between energy, water and carbon in the design of integrated energy&#8211;water systems using a new automated targeting modeling (ATM) framework. ATM incorporates the advantages of the insight-based Pinch method and a mathematical programming approach to provide visual understanding for a thorough analysis of the problem while guaranteeing accurate solutions. Minimum targets of power and water based on the integrated network operation were established by the ATM, with corresponding carbon emissions. A specific goal of annual carbon emissions reduction was set as the constraint and the ATM optimized the capacities of the components in the system accordingly to achieve minimum overall cost. The application of ATM on an industrial plant case study shows that a target of 45% reduction in the carbon discharge amount was achieved by shifting to greener fuel in the energy system at a minimum overall cost increase of 0.45% only. The framework can assist users in meeting power and water loads in their plant while planning for the appropriate decarbonization efforts at the minimum possible cost.</description>

      <title>Is methane the 'climate culprit'? Fixing the 'Broken Record' while unmasking the dangers of using imprecise, long-term GWP for methane to address the climate emergency.</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/g8k2a</link>

                Abstract Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) with a short atmospheric half-life (~8.4 years) and a high short-term impact on global warming which is significantly higher than that of CO2. Traditional metrics such as the 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) obscure the short-term, negative climatic effects of methane, potentially leading to inadequate policy responses. This study examines the limitations of GWP100 in capturing the true climate impact of methane, explores alternative metrics, and discusses the implications of under-reporting methane emissions. We highlight the necessity of adopting a more immediate perspective on methane to accelerate climate emergency action, while noting the adverse effects of the rapid growth rate of methane emissions on reduction efforts. Additionally, we hope that during COP29, policymakers will adopt actions that pay appropriate attention to the short-term warming potential of methane to dramatically reduce emissions and address the immediate climate crisis.Summary Points for Policy Makers. 1.Increased emissions monitoring with timely reporting to support stringent policies; 2.Urgent development and implementation of policies committing to a planned phase-out of existing GHG emission sources, prioritized by the level of emissions, including existing and planned fossil fuel projects to be replaced by renewable energy sources; 3.Immediate methane emission reductions for both &#8220;reported&#8221; and &#8220;natural&#8221; sources with increased investment by government and private, and penalties for target failures; and4.Improved, expanded communication among researchers, the public, and policy-makers.</description>

      <title>Molecular Cages as Encapsulants for the Stabilization of Reactive Iron-Sulfur Cofactor Models</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-vk5d3</link>
      <description>Rupal Baliyan, Gwendolyn A. Bailey, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404144270

                Iron-sulfur clusters are desirable targets for bioinspired synthesis due to their versatility in promoting a range of catalytic reactions (N2 reduction to NH3, CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons, and selective C&#8211;H functionalizations) and ability to serve as model systems for the systematic interrogation of structure and mechanism. However, a challenge in replicating the activity of clusters remains their instability outside of the protein scaffold. Previous efforts to mitigate this challenge include incorporation into polymeric and aerogel networks and artificial metalloenzymes or installation of bulky, strong-field ligands, but none of these retain both the native weak-field primary ligand sphere and capacity for molecular-level tuning of the cofactor and second coordination sphere. Herein, we present a new strategy for stabilizing weak-field synthetic clusters and conferring second coordination sphere functionality via encapsulation inside molecular cages. Thus, clusters [Fe4S4(SR)4]2&#8211; ([1a-c]2&#8211;: R = Ph, CH2CH2OH, tBu) are encapsulated inside tetrahedral naphthalene diimide (NDI)-functionalized cages [M4L6]8+ (M = Fe, Ni, Zn) via a robust and generalizable electrostatic binding strategy. 1H and DOSY NMR, ESI-MS, and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer studies confirm immediate and quantitative binding and suggest the cluster electronic structure is minimally perturbed by the cage. At the same time, the cage&#8217;s redox-switching ability is demonstrated in CV and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer studies demonstrating that NDI reduction renders the encapsulated cofactors [1a-b]2&#8211; significantly more reducing, consistent with their effective charge donation to the cofactor via pi-pi stacking and H-bonding interactions. Importantly, cofactor reactivity is maintained as demonstrated in diphenylacetylene reduction trials, showing that the encapsulated clusters are not only structural but also functional cofactor models. Combined, these results demonstrate that molecular cages can function as protein-like encapsulants to site isolate, tune, and deliver substrate to functional weak-field models of bioinorganic cofactors, and support the use of molecular host-guest complexes as functional enzyme mimics for both catalytic and structure-function studies.</description>

      <title>Imagining a net-zero Teesside: actors, networks, and expectations in industrial decarbonisation megaprojects</title>

                Abstract Decarbonising industrial clusters is critical to achieving the UK&#8217;s net-zero industrial strategy. This study focuses on Teesside, an industrial cluster in Northeast England, analysing its transition through the framework of the Sociology of Expectations (SoE). The research investigates the role of public and private stakeholders in driving decarbonisation efforts, concentrating on a limited set of technologies and large-scale megaprojects, especially carbon capture, hydrogen production, CO2 and hydrogen transport. The study highlights the challenges of deploying these first-of-a-kind technologies, which are not yet commercially viable in the UK. Our analysis identifies both opportunities and significant risks in Teesside&#8217;s approach, particularly the potential over-reliance on a narrow range of technologies. The findings raise concerns about the assumed reductions in costs and carbon emissions, questioning the feasibility of scaling these technologies for long-term industrial sustainability. The main implication is that, should the technologies currently favoured by incumbent industry fail to perform, the expectations could play a double and contradictory role in net-zero transitions&#8212;by both motivating actors to legitimise decarbonisation technologies, yet blinding others to the significant challenges that lie ahead.</description>

      <title>Optimized Build Orientation and Laser Scanning Strategies for Reducing Thermal Residual Stress in Topology-Optimized Automotive Components</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/met14111277</link>
      <description>Jeongho Yang, Youngsuk Jung, Jaewoong Jung, Jae Dong Ock, Shinhu Cho, Sang&#8208;Hu Park, Tae Hee Lee, Jiyong Park, Metals. 14(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404248103

                This study investigates the reduction in thermal residual stress during the powder bed fusion (PBF) process in a non-standardized shape generated by topology optimization method in lightweight automotive part of brake caliper. While the caliper of the braking system for reducing the CO2 consumption in vehicle systems undergoes a redesign to increased strength and reduced weight, challenges arise due to biased melting area ratios in the topologically optimized design, causing the thermal deformation. To address this, our research proposes an efficient PBF scan strategy aimed at minimizing anisotropy and residual stress&#8212;a critical consideration for successful manufacturing. The effectiveness of the laser scan strategy is validated through testing on a brake dynamometer, following the JASO C406 test procedure, an authorized standard for commercial brake calipers. Furthermore, a comparative analysis between the conventional product and the proposed brake caliper highlights superior performance, particularly under lightweight conditions. This comprehensive approach contributes valuable insights to the field, offering a potential solution for overcoming manufacturing challenges associated with topologically optimized designs in automotive components.</description>

                Electric mobility is a global trend and necessity, with electric and solar boats offering a promising alternative for transportation electrification and carbon emission reduction, especially in the Amazon region. This study analyzes the system of a solar boat from an electric mobility project&#8212;to be implemented at Universidade Federal do Par&#225; (UFPA)&#8212;using MATLAB software for modeling. The Simulink tool was utilized to model the system, focusing on operational parameters such as module voltage, converter voltage, and speed. The results indicate that the solar boat&#8217;s operational cost is significantly lower compared to a similar internal combustion model, considering diesel&#8217;s high consumption and cost. The environmental impact is also reduced, with nearly 72 tons of CO2 emissions avoided annually, thanks to Brazil&#8217;s renewable energy matrix. Simulations confirmed the project&#8217;s parameters, demonstrating the efficiency of digital-twin technology in monitoring and predicting system performance. The study underscores the importance of digital twins and renewable energy in promoting sustainable transportation solutions, advocating for the replication of such projects globally. Future research should focus on further advancing digital-twin applications in electric mobility to enhance predictive maintenance and operational efficiency.</description>

                Chemical looping combustion (CLC) emerges as a cost-effective CO2 capture technology, demonstrating high competitiveness for both industrial and energy applications. This study explores the synthesis of a Cu-based, praseodymium (Pr)-modified gamma-alumina-supported (20CuPA) oxygen carrier (OC) through the wet impregnation method and investigates its performance in CLC. The characteristics of the synthesized OC were investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction analysis, and X-ray diffraction analysis. The CLC of methane gas was performed in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA-Q50). The oxygen transport capacity (OTC) of the 20CuPA-based OC was investigated for 10 redox cycles. The impact of temperature and time as process variables in determining the OTC of OCs was studied. The TGA results indicated that the most important factor influencing the optimization of the OTC of OCs was time. In comparison to time, temperature had less of an impact on the OTC of 20CuPA-OC. The maximum OTC of 20CuPA-OC, which was 0.0546 mg of O2/mg of OC, was reached using optimized process variables, including a temperature of 800 &#176;C and a time of 3 min.</description>

                Coal-fired power plants are a main source of energy in Poland. In the rapidly growing demand for the reduction of CO2 emission in the energy industry, the use of biomass for energy purposes has increased significantly. The combustion of biomass results in the generation of fly ash, with higher levels of CaO, K2O, P2O5, in contrast to the fly ash derived from the combustion of coal. The aim of this study was to examine the influence of phosphate compounds on fly ash-based geopolymer mortars. Geopolymers were made by mixing two types of fly ash&#8212;one from the combustion of wood biomass and the second from the combustion of coal in a heat and power station. Basic activators (NaOH and Na2SiO3) were used for the alkali activation. The maximum level of tetraphosphorus decaoxide addition was established at 5% of the total mass of the aluminosilicate precursors mass. The results showed that the phosphate oxide concentration within the specimens demonstrated a positive correlation with flexural and compressive strength across all temporal intervals (7, 28, and 56 days). The porosity, however, for samples with a 5% addition of P4O10, increased more than twofold in comparison to reference samples (from 4.26% to 9.98%).</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17225535</link>
      <description>Barbara Klemczak, Beata Kucharczyk-Brus, Anna Sulimowska-Ociepka, Rafa&#322; Radziewicz-Winnicki, Energies. 17(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404115706

                The European Climate Law mandates a 55% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030, intending to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. To meet these targets, there is a strong focus on reducing energy consumption in buildings, particularly for heating and cooling, which are the primary drivers of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, the demand for energy-efficient and sustainable buildings is increasing, and thermal insulation plays a crucial role in minimizing energy consumption for both winter heating and summer cooling. This review explores the historical development of thermal insulation materials, beginning with natural options such as straw, wool, and clay, progressing to materials like cork, asbestos, and mineral wool, and culminating in synthetic insulators such as fiberglass and polystyrene. The review also examines innovative materials like polyurethane foam, vacuum insulation panels, and cement foams enhanced with phase change materials. Additionally, it highlights the renewed interest in environmentally friendly materials like cellulose, hemp, and sheep wool. The current challenges in developing sustainable, high-performance building solutions are discussed, including the implementation of the 6R principles for insulating materials. Finally, the review not only traces the historical evolution of insulation materials but also provides various classifications and summarizes emerging aspects in the field.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17225581</link>
      <description>Georgios Martinopoulos, Alexandros Tsimpoukis, Vasileios Sougkakis, Petros Dallas, Komninos Angelakoglou, Paraskevi Giourka, Nikos &#925;ikolopoulos, Energies. 17(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404188813

                This paper explores the development of positive energy communities using Eordaia, Greece, as a case study. The approach combines building and district-level energy analysis to achieve nearly zero energy performance through retrofitting, district-level storage systems, and renewable energy technologies. A parametric analysis utilizing RETSCREEN Expert and EnergyPlan software determines the optimal mix of technologies based on technical and financial parameters, with Eordaia, a region in energy transition and part of the RESPONSE Horizon project, illustrating the practical benefits. It includes a neighborhood of 105 mixed-use properties and two municipal buildings where a range of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures are applied. Insulation, photovoltaic systems, LED lighting, predictive thermostats, and windows coated with nanotechnology are some of the key interventions considered. The findings show considerable reductions in CO2 emissions and energy use, with payback periods ranging from 8.7 to 9.6 years. This study underscores the value of district-level strategies over individual building retrofits, highlighting cost savings and improved energy performance. These findings offer valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers aiming to transform urban areas into sustainable, positive energy districts, supporting the EU&#8217;s 2050 net-zero emissions goals.</description>

                In recent decades, renewable energy sources (hereinafter - RES) have become an increasingly important component of global energy policy, especially in the context of the need for sustainable development and the fight against climate change. This study analyzes the role of international cooperation in the development of RES in Kazakhstan and assesses its impact on national strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to sustainable energy. The research employs cluster analysis to identify groups of partner countries with similar energy and environmental profiles, complemented by Ward&#8217;s dendrogram and scenario analysis to predict the future directions of international cooperation. Data from the Bureau of National Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan, including greenhouse gas emissions, the share of renewable energy in total energy consumption, water resource availability, fuel exports, and energy intensity, were utilized. Three main clusters were identified: countries with advanced technologies in the field of RES, countries with emerging RES markets, and countries focused on hydrocarbon exports but seeking to diversify their energy resources. Cluster analysis revealed that Kazakhstan falls into the group with high energy intensity and a low share of RES in the energy balance (1.8%). Scenario analysis demonstrated that with active international cooperation, the share of RES in Kazakhstan could increase to 10-12% by 2030, and energy intensity could decrease, leading to a reduction in CO2 emissions. For future research, an in-depth analysis of Kazakhstan&#8217;s international cooperation in the field of renewable energy sources with an emphasis on regional specifics is recommended.</description>

                In recent research on building materials, researchers have increasingly focused on replacing cement with agricultural waste. This approach offers significant advantages in terms of reducing global CO2 emissions and promoting the sustainability of building materials. In this paper, the use of the agricultural waste walnut shell ash (WSA) to partially replace cement in sustainable green mortars is explored. Specifically, equal amounts of WSA (5%, 10% and 15%) were used to replace cement. To offset the reduction in strength caused by the partial replacement of cement with WSA, basalt fibers were added to the mortar mixture. The effect of these fibers on the mechanical properties of the WSA-reinforced mortar was examined in compression tests, split tensile tests, and flexural fatigue cycle tests. In the flexural fatigue tests, the parameter and length of basalt fibers were varied and different stress levels (0.85, 0.8 and 0.75) were applied. The fatigue equations were developed using the Weibull model and p&#8211;s&#8211;n curves with a survival probability of 0.5 were derived. The results showed that the compressive strength and split tensile strength of the specimens increased with the addition of basalt fibers, with maximum values of 34.7 MPa and 3.8 MPa, respectively, and maximum increases of 8.78% and 21.95%, respectively. In addition, the average fatigue life of WSA mortar was 247,541 cycles, which increased by 139.26% when the stress level was 0.75, fiber length was 9 mm, and dosage was 0.3%. The linear regression fitting showed good correlation and provided valuable insights for practical engineering applications.</description>

(1&#8722;3) Professor Haoshen Zhou from Nanjing University, China, has been selected as the 2024 PIER in the field of batteries and energy storage for his outstanding contribution to the area of high energy density secondary battery materials and systems. (4) We are honored to have the opportunity to celebrate his outstanding contributions in this special issue (SI).Professor Haoshen Zhou received his bachelor's degree in semiconductor physics from the Department of Physics at Nanjing University in 1985, master's degree in 1988 from the Nanjing Institute of Electronic Devices, and Ph.D. in chemical engineering in the School of Engineering at The University of Tokyo, Japan, in 1994. After his Ph.D. study, he pursued a further 3 years of postdoctoral training at RIKEN in Japan. In 1997, Professor Haoshen Zhou joined the Energy Interface Department of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan, to pursue energy-related scientific research. He was promoted to a professor-level senior researcher in 2004 and became the chief senior researcher in AIST's Energy Department in 2011. During his tenure in Japan, Professor Zhou led numerous projects funded by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), and the Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO). In 2012, he joined Nanjing University's College of Engineering and Applied Sciences as a full professor. Professor Zhou established the Department of Energy Science and Engineering and Center of Energy Storage Materials &amp; Technology, where he served as their inaugural chairs. He was also appointed as a Yangtse Distinguished Professor by the Chinese Ministry of Education (2010). He held concurrent appointments as a special professor at The University of Tokyo and University of Tsukuba in Japan. Professor Zhou has served as an associate editor of Science Bulletin and Energy Storage Materials as well as an expert in charge of the National Key R&amp;D Program's "Smart Grid Key Project" in China. During 2014&#8211;2018, he was the chief scientist for China's National Key Research Program in Nanotechnology. Professor Zhou received the "Lihua Yi" Chemical Innovation Award from the Chinese Chemical Society (2023) and the First Prize from the Chinese Materials Research Society (2024). Over his career, Professor Zhou has mentored more than 80 postdoctoral fellows and doctoral students, of which many have grown into emerging leaders in their respective research areas.Professor Haoshen Zhou has long been dedicated to the innovation and engineering of new high-energy-density battery systems and key materials. He established the reaction theory for high-capacity air electrodes, invented solid-state batteries based on sieving electrolytes, and developed and expanded the combined electrolyte battery system. As a corresponding author, he has published over 500 research papers and is a holder of over 80 authorized patents. Professor Zhou is a pioneer in the field of lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries, proposed a comprehensive mechanism for oxygen anion redox energy storage, and designed new high-energy-density lithium batteries. (5&#8722;9) Zhou and his team creatively introduced the "Li2O&#8211;Li2O2" oxygen anion redox process for charge storage, offering advantages such as high coulombic efficiency, good reversibility, and mild stability for the battery system. (6) He also discovered the critical role of trace amounts of H2O in enhancing the catalytic activity of oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) processes in organic electrolytes, proposing a synergistic catalytic mechanism between H2O molecules and Ru/SP/MnO2 cathodes, leading to breakthrough in lithium&#8211;air batteries. (7) Building upon the oxygen anion redox energy storage mechanism, he designed various highly efficient catalysts (e.g., Ir and Ni) to expand the reversible capacity of the cathode and suppress oxygen evolution. (6,8) Professor Zhou also proposed a concentrated dual-salt LiFSI&#8211;LiNO3/DOL electrolyte to improve the high-rate performance of lithium metal anodes, delivering stable operation for 240 cycles at 8.0 mA cm&#8211;2 and an average coulombic efficiency of 99.14%. (9) He also invented a closed lithium&#8211;oxygen battery with a lithium metal anode and high-capacity Li2O cathode, achieving a practical specific energy of 513 Wh kg&#8211;1 and a charge&#8211;discharge cycle life exceeding 200 cycles. (8) Professor Zhou summarized the essential criteria for redox mediators (RMs) to function as catalysts in lithium&#8211;air batteries and revealed the catalytic mechanism of these soluble catalysts during the charging process: (1) 2RM&#8211; + 2e&#8211; = 2RM+ and (2) 2RM+ + Li2O2 = 2Li+ + O2 + 2RM. (10) This theory led to his pioneering use of trichloroethyl chloroformate (TCCF) as a soluble catalyst for not only significantly reducing the overpotential of the OER but also greatly enhancing the reaction rate of the oxygen electrode. (11) The innovation improved the rate performance of lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries by over 10 times, with the cathode achieving a discharge specific capacity of 2005 mAh g&#8211;1 at a current density of 1 A g&#8211;1.Professor Haoshen Zhou has also made groundbreaking contributions to the study of lithium&#8211;carbon dioxide (Li&#8211;CO2) batteries, high-energy-density batteries without lithium anodes, and development of new battery systems. He introduced in situ surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to the study of CO2 electrode reactions, proposing the reaction mechanism for the reversible reduction and evolution of CO2 at the air electrode interface: 3CO2 + 4e&#8211; + 4Li+ = 2Li2CO3 + C. (12) He further introduced molten salt electrolytes, which verified the reversible reaction pathway of CO2 at the air electrode, reduced the electrode overpotential, and significantly improved the energy storage efficiency of the battery. (13) Professor Zhou and his team were the first to propose a lithium supplementation mechanism based on the OER of Li2O, successfully addressing the issue of capacity degradation caused by lithium loss during charge and discharge cycles. (14) A prototype anode-free lithium-ion battery with a layered transition metal oxide cathode was designed and operated, achieving a specific energy of 320 Wh kg&#8211;1 and a cycle life of 300 cycles. Professor Zhou also creatively introduced the concept of a combined electrolyte, constructed from "organic electrolytes", "lithium-ion solid electrolytes", and "aqueous electrolytes", integrating the characteristics of two or more electrolytes to design multiple energy conversion systems, leading to the invention of a high-capacity lithium&#8211;air battery and a technology for directly extracting elemental lithium from seawater. (15) The pioneering concept of combined electrolytes further led to the demonstration of an electrolytic cell system that has achieved both lithium extraction from seawater (or brine) and conversion of electrical energy into the chemical energy of lithium as a new energy storage solution. (16)Professor Zhou and his team further expanded the concept of combined electrolytes to integrate molecular sieves or framework compounds with organic electrolytes for successfully mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions on the anode surface, enhancing the stability of high-capacity lithium secondary batteries at high voltages (greater than 5.2 V versus Li/Li+) and elevated temperatures (100 &#176;C). (17) This achievement is significant for expanding the application scenarios of electrolytes in high-output voltage systems and improving the energy density of various battery configurations. Professor Zhou then introduced the Cu3(BTC)2 metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as a selective electrolyte in lithium&#8211;sulfur battery systems for effectively preventing polysulfide ions from shuttling to the lithium metal side, significantly reducing capacity loss with an average capacity decay of only 0.019% over 1500 cycles. (18) He also invented a polypropylene ultrathin membrane modified with MOFs that greatly enhances the cycle life of lithium metal battery systems while increasing energy density, achieving a specific energy of 354 Wh kg&#8211;1 and 80% retention of its initial capacity after 200 cycles. (19)To celebrate the achievement of Professor Zhou as one of the 2024 PIERs, Energy &amp; Fuels is also pleased to present this SI that includes a collection of 41 invited papers (22 reviews, 18 articles, and 1 communication), contributed by some invited leading as well as early to mid-career authors in the related energy field.

(26) It is a huge challenge to overcome the dissolution problem for cathode materials, especially for small-molecule organic cathode materials (SMOCMs). Song et al. investigated a commercially available vat dye, namely, flavanthrone, directly as a novel SMOCM for rechargeable lithium batteries. It possesses a low solubility benefiting from the extensive aromatic system and a high theoretical capacity based on the four electroactive C&#9552;O/C&#9552;N groups.

(28) Konkena et al. demonstrated the liquid-phase exfoliation of non-layered, bulk As4S4 material to produce quasi-two-dimensional (2D) platelets. The As4S4 anode with highly disordered, low aspect ratio quasi-2D platelets exhibits commendable performance for both Li-ion and Na-ion storage. (29) Bai et al. demonstrated an in situ self-assembly strategy where metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) grew on a polypropylene separator. This MOF-based separator achieves permselective ion transport and regulation behavior, which effectively suppresses the nucleation and growth of Li dendrites.

SIBs have great potential for large-scale energy storage devices due to the high abundance, wide distribution, and non-toxicity of the resource. Li et al. reviewed the phase transition in layered oxide cathodes, pointing out the intrinsic causes and degradation mechanisms of phase transition for SIBs. They summarize the mainstream strategies to inhibit the phase transition, such as elemental doping, surface coating, and structural modification as well as the novel strategy of introducing anionic redox, providing new comprehension in understanding the phase transition of layered oxides. (31) Wang et al. presented a thorough discussion of the current research progress on layered transition metal oxides (LTMOs) beginning with an explanation of the structure characteristics of P- and O-phase cathode materials.

(37)Zinc-Ion BatteriesClick to copy section linkSection link copied!A total of 3 papers (1 review and 2 articles) are on zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). ZIBs are viewed as promising grid-level energy storage solutions due to their high theoretical specific capacity (820 Ah kg&#8211;1 and 5855 Ah L&#8211;1), low electrochemical potential, ample geological resources, and compatibility with water. Zhang et al. comprehensively overviewed the functional role of the electrolyte additive in aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs), including regulating the solvation structure, altering the H-bond network, forming an adsorption layer, generating an electrostatic shielding effect, and constructing a solid electrolyte interphase. The development prospects and existing problems of additives are also presented. (38) Wang et al. introduced certain MnSO4 into the ZnSO4 + K2SO4 hybrid electrolyte (Zn0.5K0.25) to improve the AZIBs. MnSO4 in the hybrid electrolyte facilitates the porous MnO2 electrodeposition on PBAs, resulting in an increased contact area at the electrode/electrolyte interface, thereby accelerating the electrochemical reaction kinetics. (39) Yu et al. introduced a cost-effective copper sulfate additive, enabling the creation of a multifunctional Cu&#8211;Zn alloy solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the zinc anode.

      <title>Research on the Adsorption Performance of Zeolites for Dimethyl Ether</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/min14111141</link>
      <description>Xiaoqing Nie, Zhaoteng Xue, Wenqian Jiao, Jing Wang, Su Liu, Dongsen Mao, Minerals. 14(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404228095

                The purification and removal of polar impurities in olefin feedstocks is crucial for downstream deep processing, and adsorption is the main method for deep purification of such impurities. This article takes dimethyl ether, a typical oxygen-containing compound impurity in MTOs, as a polar impurity molecule, and LTA and FAU topological zeolites as research objects. The influence of zeolite topology, morphology, skeleton silicon&#8211;aluminum (Si/Al) ratio, and ion type on the adsorption and removal of trace dimethyl ether was investigated by XRD, SEM, XRF, and nitrogen adsorption&#8211;desorption methods. The FAU topological zeolites show a better adsorption performance for dimethyl ether owing to their larger specific surface area and unobstructed pores compared with LTA zeolites. Among FAU topological zeolites, the NaX zeolite a with lower framework silica&#8211;alumina ratio has the highest adsorption capacity for dimethyl ether. Magnesium ion exchange on NaX zeolites (MgNaX) reduce the specific surface area and adsorption capacity of the NaX zeolite. However, after forming with alumina as a binder, the adsorption capacity of the MgNaX&#8211;Al2O3 adsorbent is about 13% higher than that of the NaX&#8211;Al2O3 adsorbent without Mg ion exchange. This may be due to the decomposition of residual organic Mg salts in the Mg ion exchange samples during high-temperature calcination, resulting in a larger specific surface area for the formed adsorbent. Further characterization of NH3&#8211;TPD and CO2&#8211;TPD shows that Mg ion exchange weakens the acid&#8211;base active sites on the adsorbent surface. The reduction in acid&#8211;base sites reduces the occurrence of side reactions such as polymerization and isomerization caused by the exothermic adsorption of olefins on adsorbents. Repeated adsorption data show that the formed adsorbent has excellent regeneration&#8211;adsorption performance.</description>

      <title>Patient, financial and environmental impacts of a Medicines Optimisation in Care Homes (MOCH) service on polypharmacy following structured medication reviews</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/ijpp/riae058.068</link>
      <description>Carolyn Knight, K Blythin, Laura Nicholson, I.V. Altman, International Journal of Pharmacy Practice. 32(Supplement_2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404190655

                Abstract Introduction An NHS community trust was commissioned in February 2023 to deliver a MOCH service to about 15,000 care home residents across an Integrated Care System (ICS). Pharmacists in the MOCH service undertake Structured Medication Reviews (SMRs) to reduce inappropriate polypharmacy, working closely with care homes, General Practitioners (GPs) and community pharmacies. Pharmacy technicians undertake medication reviews to reduce low clinical value medicines. A patient-centred approach means medicines are stopped or changed following shared-decision making with the resident, carer or family. Aim To find out the impact of the MOCH service on reducing inappropriate polypharmacy, reducing medicines-related harm for residents, and to report financial savings and the environmental impact through reduction of CO2 emissions. Methods This service evaluation was approved by the Trust. No ethics approval was required. Quarterly and 6- monthly data sets covering one week reported by the MOCH service in the financial year 2023/2024 were used. These data sets were extrapolated to a full year. This service reported the number of medicines stopped, started and changed over one week of each quarter for SMRs and, pharmacy technicians reported every six months. Cost savings were calculated using the drug tariff based on continued use of medicines for one year. Pharmacists reported reduction in harm from medicines every six months based on a health interventions risk assessment scoring tool, assessing how many residents had potentially avoided moderate to serious harm following a SMR. The carbon savings were calculated based on financial savings from medicines stopped or changed using the DEFRA SIC 2020 Greenhouse Gases emission factor 0.621(kgCO2e/&#163;) for pharmaceuticals1. Results In the first year the MOCH service completed SMRs for 11,363 residents (75% of care home residents in the ICS). Around 20,000 medicines for residents were stopped (one to two medicines per resident). Pharmacists predicted moderate to high-risk harm from medicines was reduced in approximately 4,200 residents. The cost savings from medicines stopped or changed was approximately &#163;2.8 million, which translated to carbon savings of 1,773,340 kgCO2e, the equivalent of removing 644 cars from the road for one year. Discussion and Conclusion Reducing inappropriate polypharmacy resulted in a reduction of treatment burden, potential harm to residents2 and financial savings. Social impacts include reducing workload for care homes, GPs and community pharmacies, ultimately increasing the capacity of this stretched workforce (less dispensing, reduced risk of error, shorter medicine rounds and more time for residents). The environmental impact goes beyond carbon savings from pharmaceuticals to include reduction in workload, consumables, delivery and cost of waste disposal and prevention of hospital admissions.3 The limitations of this evaluation are that data collected over one week and then extrapolated may not be representative of all the other weeks in terms of cost savings and reduction of harm to residents, however MOCH pharmacists undertake peer reviews of reduction in harms to mitigate this. Costs incurred in making the financial savings were excluded. As the demographic of older people rises in the next 20 years a medication review is increasingly important to residents, the health economy, workforce, and our environment. References 1.

                IntroductionModern acid-producing diets in patients with stage G3-G5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) can cause severe acid accumulation with metabolic acidosis and less severe accumulation causing eubicarbonatemic acidosis in stages G2-G3, each with kidney injury. The impact of these diets on acid accumulation in those with CKD but normal eGFR (G1) is unclear.MethodsWe assessed whether acid accumulation occurs in patients with CKD and normal eGFR, and if added base-producing fruits and vegetables (F&amp;V) or oral NaHCO3 (HCO3-) reduces acid accumulation and/or lowers kidney injury. We randomized 153 macroalbuminuric, non-diabetic, G1 (mean eGFR = 101 ml/min/1.73 m2) participants with hypertension-associated CKD to receive F&amp;Vs in amounts to reduce dietary acid intake 50% (F&amp;V, n=51), oral NaHCO3 to match alkali intake of F&amp;V (HCO3-, n=51), or usual care (UC, n=51) for five years. We assessed acid accumulation by comparing observed to expected increase in plasma total CO2 in response to retained bicarbonate (dose minus urine bicarbonate excretion) two hours after an oral NaHCO3 bolus.ResultsBaseline acid accumulation, eGFR, urine excretion of albumin, N-acetyl-&#946;-D-glucosamine, and angiotensinogen were not different among groups. Five-year acid accumulation [mean(SD)] was lower in F&amp;V [-1.2 (11.0) mmoles] and HCO3- [-1.7 (10.8) mmoles] than UC [5.2 (10.3) mmoles, p&lt;0.003)], consistent with lower acid accumulation in F&amp;V and HCO3-. Five-year urine excretion of albumin, N-acetyl-&#946;-D-glucosamine, and angiotensinogen were lower in F&amp;V and HCO3- than UC, consistent with less kidney injury.ConclusionsDietary acid reduction reduces acid accumulation and kidney injury in patients with CKD and normal eGFR.</description>

                Abstract Members of the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of 24 states committed to achieving the emissions reductions outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement, are considering policy options for inclusion of forest carbon in climate mitigation plans. These initiatives are generally limited by a lack of relevant data on forest carbon stocks and fluxes past-to-future. Previously, we developed a new forest carbon modeling system that combines high-resolution remote sensing, field data, and ecological modeling to estimate contemporary above-ground forest carbon stocks, and projected future forest carbon sequestration potential for the state of Maryland. Here we extended this work to provide a consistent geospatial approach for monitoring changes in forest carbon stocks over time. Utilizing the same data and modeling system developed previously for planning, we integrated historical input data on weather and disturbance to reconstruct the history of vegetation dynamics and forest above-ground carbon stocks annually over the period 1984-2016 at 30 m resolution and provided an extension to 2023. Statewide, forested land had an average annual net above ground carbon sink of 1.37 TgC yr-1, comparable to prior estimates. However, unlike the prior estimates, there was considerable variation around this mean. The statewide net above ground flux ranged interannually from -0.65 - 2.77 Tg C yr-1. At the county scale, the average annual net above ground flux ranged spatially from 0.01 - 0.13 Tg C yr-1 and spatiotemporally from -0.43 - 0.24 Tg C yr -1. Attribution analyses indicate the primary importance of persistent and regrowing forests, vegetation structure, local disturbance, and rising CO2 to the mean flux, and the primary importance of weather to the large-scale interannual variability. These results have important implications for state climate mitigation planning, reporting and assessment. With this approach, it is now possible to monitor changes in forest carbon stocks spatiotemporally over policy relevant domains with a consistent framework that is also enabled for future planning.</description>

Reducing the average turnaround time can be resolved by controlling the yard crane operation and the arrival times of external trucks (truck appointment system). Because the truck appointment system and yard crane scheduling problem are closely interconnected, this research investigates synchronization between the approaches used in truck appointment systems and yard crane scheduling strategies. Rubber-tired gantry (RTG) operators for yard crane scheduling operations strive to reduce RTG movement time as part of the container retrieval service. However, there is a conflict between individual agent goals. While seeking to minimize truck turnaround time, RTGs may travel long distances, ultimately slowing down the RTG service. Methods: We address a method that balances individual agent goals while also considering the collective objective, thereby minimizing turnaround time. An agent-based simulation is proposed to simulate scenarios for yard crane scheduling strategies and truck appointment system approaches, which are centralized and decentralized. This study explores the combined effects of different yard scheduling strategies and truck appointment procedures on performance indicators. Various configurations of the truck appointment system and yard scheduling strategies are modeled to investigate how those factors affect the average turnaround time, yard crane utilization, and CO2 emissions. Results: At all levels of truck arrival rates, the nearest-truck-first-served (NTFS) scenario tends to provide lower external truck turnaround times than the first-come-first-served (FCFS) and nearest-truck longest-waiting-time first-served (NLFS) scenario. Conclusions: The decentralized truck appointment system (DTAS) generally shows slightly higher efficiency in emission reduction compared with centralized truck appointment system (CTAS), especially at moderate to high truck arrival rates. The decentralized approach of the truck appointment system should be accompanied by the yard scheduling strategy to obtain better performance indicators.</description>

                To address the growing scarcity of freshwater resources, the use of saline water for agricultural irrigation is gaining increasing attention. This study presents findings from a two-year field experiment conducted during the 2023 and 2024 maize-growing seasons in northwestern China. The objective of the experiment was to evaluate the main and interactive effects of saline irrigation water on soil water&#8211;salt dynamics, maize growth, photosynthetic characteristics, water productivity, and carbon emissions. The experiment involved nine treatments with three irrigation amounts: 4500 m3 hm&#8722;2 (W1), 5625 m3 hm&#8722;2 (W2), and 6750 m3 hm&#8722;2 (W3), combined with three water salinity levels: 0.85 g L&#8722;1 (S1, freshwater), 3 g L&#8722;1 (S2), and 5 g L&#8722;1 (S3). Results indicated that both irrigation amount and salinity level significantly affected water&#8211;salt dynamics, with more soil accumulating in the 0&#8211;100 cm soil layer under saline irrigation water; however, this effect diminished with higher irrigation amounts. The maximum leaf area index and plant height were affected by both the irrigation amount and salinity level, as well as their interaction. Photosynthetic capacity declined with increasing salinity of the irrigation water, ultimately reducing grain yield and irrigation water use efficiency. Compared to freshwater (S1), the average maize grain yield under S2 and S3 treatments decreased by 6.28% and 15.43% in 2023 and by 7.82% and 17.48% in 2024, respectively. Additionally, for the same irrigation amount, higher salinity of the irrigation water (S2, S3) significantly reduced total soil CO2 emissions, with reductions of 10.08% and 27.53% in 2023, and 11.97% and 28.01% in 2024, respectively. In summary, to optimize the utilization of saline water, enhance maize yield, and improve soil carbon sequestration, we recommend maintaining the salinity of irrigation water below 3 g L&#8722;1, and using an irrigation amount of 6750 m3 hm&#8722;2 (W3S2) for optimal outcomes in the study area.</description>

      <title>Effect of terrestrial nutrient limitation on the estimation of the remaining carbon budget</title>

                Abstract. The carbon cycle plays a foundational role in the estimation of the remaining carbon budget. It is intrinsic for the determination of the transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions and the zero-emissions commitment. For the terrestrial carbon cycle, nutrient limitation is a core regulation on the amount of carbon fixed by terrestrial vegetation. Hence, the addition of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in land model structures in Earth system models is essential for an accurate representation of the carbon cycle feedback in future climate projections. Therefore, the estimation of the remaining carbon budget is impacted by the representation of nutrient limitation in modelled terrestrial ecosystems; however, it is rarely accounted for. Here, we estimate the carbon budget and remaining carbon budget of a nutrient-limited Earth system model, using nitrogen and phosphorus cycles to limit vegetation productivity and biomass. We use eight Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (hereafter SSP) scenarios and idealized experiments with three distinct model structures: (1) carbon cycle without nutrient limitation, (2) carbon cycle with terrestrial nitrogen limitation, and (3) carbon cycle with terrestrial nitrogen and phosphorus limitation. To capture the uncertainty in the remaining carbon budget, three different climate sensitives were tuned for each model version. Our results show that, overall, nutrient limitation reduced the remaining carbon budget for all simulations in comparison with the carbon cycle without nutrient limitation. Between nitrogen and nitrogen&#8211;phosphorus limitation, the latter had the lowest remaining carbon budget. The mean remaining carbon budgets obtained from the SSP scenario simulations for the 1.5 &#176;C target in the non-nutrient-limited, nitrogen-limited, and nitrogen&#8211;phosphorus-limited models were 228, 185, and 175 Pg C, respectively, relative to the year 2020. For the 2 &#176;C target, the mean remaining carbon budget values were 471, 373, and 351 Pg C for the non-nutrient-limited, nitrogen-limited, and nitrogen&#8211;phosphorus-limited models, respectively, relative to the year 2020. This represents a reduction of 19 % and 24 % for the 1.5 &#176;C target and 21 % and 26 % for the 2 &#176;C target for the respective nitrogen- and nitrogen&#8211;phosphorus-limited simulations compared with the non-nutrient-limited model. These results show that terrestrial nutrient limitation constitutes an important factor to be considered when estimating or interpreting remaining carbon budgets and that it is an essential uncertainty in the remaining carbon budgets from Earth system model simulations.</description>

      <title>Editorial: Herbicide efficacy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fagro.2024.1504465</link>
      <description>Simerjeet Kaur, K&#225;ssio Ferreira Mendes, Friday Ekeleme, Demosthenis Chachalis, Bhagirath Singh Chauhan, Frontiers in Agronomy. 6(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404160417

                Herbicides are chemicals used to manage unwanted plants (terrestrial or aquatic) called weeds.Over a long period, there has been a continuous effort to develop more selective herbicide compounds.However, the introduction of new herbicides with either a new mode of action or novel chemical classes has slowed in the last 30 years. For example, relatively few herbicides with new modes of action (MOAs) have been discovered in the past two decades (Qu, 2021). Farmers prefer chemical herbicides as they are the most effective and practical way to control weeds due to their high efficacy, specific mode of action, affordable cost, and better profitability (Abouziena et al., 2016). Herbicides can enter a plant through roots, shoots, stems, foliage, or buds. To be effective, contact herbicides must adequately contact plants, while plants must then absorb systemic herbicides, move within the plants to the site of action without being deactivated and reach the site of action at toxic levels. Herbicide selectivity is based on differential absorption, translocation, and metabolism of herbicides in plants.Overall, herbicide performance largely depends on its application rate, environmental impacts, and spray technology.In the wake of climate change, rising CO2 could alter yield losses due to competition from weeds, and weed control will be crucial in realizing any potential increase in the yield of C3 crops (Kaur et al., 2020). Climate variability also directly affects herbicide efficacy by altering the absorption and translocation of herbicides within the plant. Climate change leading to altered environmental conditions increases the risk for metabolism-based reduction in herbicide efficacy for weed control. distinct variation in efficacy of 2,4-D was found in Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. 33Watson) grown at high temperature low temperature enhanced 2,4-D metabolism at high 34 temperature resulted in reduced herbicide to control of the resistant A. palmeri population (Rudell et 35 al., 2023). Besides the physicochemical properties of herbicides, environmental factors such as 36 temperature, humidity, wind speed, and soil physicochemical properties may significantly impact the 37 performance of herbicides. Knowledge of soil phase characteristics and the mechanisms involved in 38 herbicide transformation can help to understand the fate of herbicides in soil. Therefore, current 39Research Topic was initiated for this purpose and includes five research papers on application timing, 40 herbicide rotation, integrated use of herbicides with non-chemical measures and evaluation of herbicide 41 efficacy. 42 Annual/rigid ryegrass (Lolium rigidum Gaudin) has evolved resistance to herbicides of multiple 43 modes of action groups in many parts of the world (Heap, 2024); probably the worst-case scenario is 44 evolved in many cropping regions in Australia. Dose-response studies are helpful in evaluating 45 herbicide efficacy for weed control, crop safety, putative herbicide resistance, and herbicide persistence 46 production. feasible integrated weed management systems, including herbicide 65 programs with herbicides and crop rotations, may be designed for diverse production situations 66 can reduce weed infestations and environmental impacts, and prolong the use of (Kaur 67 et al., 2023b). Another manuscript by Vulchi et al., (2023) corroborate the above statements. This 68 manuscript highlights that, when crop rotations were integrated with dicamba-based herbicide 69 programs and residual herbicides, it helped in effective management of Palmer amaranth across tillage 70 types and environments. 71In conclusion, this special Research Topic on Herbicide Efficacy explored the relevant aspects 72 for sustainable weed management with herbicides. Creating a novel herbicide is a significant challenge 73 for the industry; therefore, good stewardship practices must be maintained to increase the herbicide 74 life. The high costs, regulatory hurdles and eventual resistance make new discoveries daunting. 75Recently, herbicide-tolerant crops (and genetically modified organisms in general) are considered an 76 agro-business opportunity, potentially allowing the use of one and the same herbicide across many 77 crops. The increasing world population seems to be a major driver for the need to increase food 78 production output per area. The high impact of weed competition on yields makes weed control 79 mandatory. To secure crop yields, herbicides for weed management will continue to be the preferred 80 choice for the foreseeable future. However, herbicides should persist long enough to check weeds until 81 the end of the critical period of weed competition but should not persist beyond the crop harvest. 82 Moreover, the physicochemical properties of herbicides affect their behaviour in soil and regulate their 83 interaction mechanisms with organic and inorganic soil phases. Predicting herbicide movement and 84 fate in soils is an important strategy in limiting their environmental impact. The non-sustainable use of 85 pesticides, low efficacy, faster evolution of resistance in weeds, pollution and biomagnification of 86 pesticides in agroecosystems and food chains are questioning the success of chemical weed control. 87As one of the future trends, these adverse effects of herbicides would be addressed with the novel 88 developments in nanotechnology. However, the road to finally accepting nanoherbicides in current 89 cropping systems is not a short one; several obstacles need to be overcome including the regulating 90 framework for their approval. 91</description>
