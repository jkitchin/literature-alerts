                Abstract Nickel anchored N-doped carbon electrocatalysts (Ni-N-C) are rapidly developed for the electrochemical reduction reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR). However, the high-performanced Ni-N-C analogues design for CO2RR remains bewilderment, for the reason lacking of definite guidance for its structure-activity relationship. Herein, the correlation between the proportion of nitrogen species derived from various nitrogen sources and the CO2RR activity of Ni-N-C is investigated. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum combined with the CO2RR performance results show that pyridinic-N content has a positive correlation with CO2RR activity. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that pyridinic-N coordinated Ni-N4 sites offers optimized free energy and favorable selectivity towards CO2RR compared with pyrrolic-N. Accordingly, Ni-Na-C with highest pyridinic-N content (ammonia as nitrogen source) performs superior CO2RR activity, with the maximum carbon monoxide faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 99.8% at -0.88 V vs. RHE and the FECO surpassing 95% within potential ranging of -0.88 to -1.38 V vs. RHE. The building of this parameter for CO2RR activity of Ni-N-C give instructive forecast for low-cost and highly active CO2RR electrocatalysts.&amp;#xD;</description>

                Formation of C&#8208;N bonds through the electrochemical utilization of CO2 and nitrogen containing compounds (N&#8208;compounds) is appealing for the purpose of converting waste and readily available sources or pollutants into value added chemicals at ambient conditions. Existing research predominantly explores these electrochemical reactions independently, often in aqueous electrolytes, leading to challenges associated with competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), low product selectivity, and yield. Functional electrolytes such as those containing ionic liquids (ILs) present selective solubility to the solute reactants and present unique interactions with the electrode surface that can suppress the undesired side reaction HER while simultaneously co&#8208;catalyzing the conversion of CO2 and N&#8208;compounds such as N2, NO, NO2, andNO3. In this concept paper, we discuss how the microenvironment enabled by ILs can be leveraged to stabilize reaction intermediates at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, thereby promoting C&#8208;N bond formation on an active electrode surface at reduced overpotential, with the case study of CO2 and N&#8208;compounds co&#8208;catalysis to generate urea.</description>

                Abstract CO2 capture and transformation into chemical fuels presents a useful carbon-neutral energy source to curb the effects of global warming if the electrocatalyst used is highly active, exhibits sufficient product selectivity, and is energetically efficient. Metal nanoparticles (NPs) have emerged as a promising class of catalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and their product selectivity can be further improved through surface modification with different ligands. The primary objective of this work is to compare the use of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and cyclic voltammetry with a rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) to study CO2 reduction at silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) modified with amino acids (cysteine and tryptophan) and Ag NPs synthesized by a citrate reduction method. RRDE studies showed the onset potential for CO2RR was earlier for both the Ag NPs with cysteine and Ag NPs with tryptophan than those with citrate. SECM showed earlier onset potentials for CO2RR than the RRDE experiment for every type of Ag NP as well as the formation of different CO2RR products. SECM also showed less hydrogen formation for the Ag NPs with cysteine and Ag NPs with tryptophan. Comparing RRDE and SECM, SECM appears more sensitive for detecting products of CO2RR.</description>

                Corrole, a contracted tetrapyrrolic macrocycle has been also used to design molecular for the CO2 reduction. The electrochemical activity towards CO2 reduction can rival those of their porphyrin analogues. However, the catalytic activity of the metallocorrole is initiated at the corresponding MII/I couple. Accordingly, a catalytic current in presence of CO2 with cobalt corrole appears when the CoI species is generated. We have designed an electron deficient A2B corrole holding two &#8208;CF3 groups and a benzonitrile in the meso positions and its cobalt complex (1). We reasoned that these groups could shuffle the redox potentials to reach the M(I) oxidation states at more positive values thereby lowering the overpotential for the catalytic CO2 reduction. Our results clearly show that catalyst 1 when adsorbed on a carbon electrode, shows the most favourable catalytic performance for CO production, achieving an efficiency of 85% with a current density of &#8208;1.5 mA cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;1.0 V vs NHE. The current densities of controlled potential electrolysis with increasing amount of KHCO3, were found to increase more than one order of magnitude with the formation of MeOH.</description>

      <title>A novel electrochemical approach to the CO2 reduction in Alkaline Hydrothermal Vent</title>

                More than a century has passed since the hypothesis was first proposed that primordial biological molecules could have formed from non-biological material with the input of some form of energy. Great efforts have been made to test possible energy sources in various environments and to determine whether the abiogenesis of biological molecules is possible. Among all the theories, the one involving hydrothermal vents has recently captured particular attention because it is based on the idea that the reduction of CO2 and the initiation of a proto-metabolism could have occurred by exploiting a life-like thermodynamic disequilibrium on mineral structure that shows structural and compositional similarities with some catalytic centre of enzimes.1&amp;#8211;3Hydrothermal Vent are geological formation generated from the upwelling of geothermal fluids into the ocean, there are two main types of HTV: black smokers (acidic ones) and white smokers (alkaline ones). In the Archean era Alkaline Hydrothermal Vent were generated by the reaction between alkaline (pH 10-11), warm and hydrogen rich fluids with the ocean rich in CO2 (acidic 10-11) and metal ions such as Fe, Ni, Zn, Co, Mn; here at the mixing point a mineral barrier precipitate, composed mainly of iron oxide and hydroxide, green rust and iron sulphide. Across this mineral membrane an electrochemical potential difference is generated, because of the disparity in pH and redox species between the inner and outer sides of the vent, this thermodynamic disequilibrium can be dissipated by coupling two opposite reactions: CO2 reduction and H2 oxidation, the two semireaction take place on the opposite sides of the same mineral structure but in two different environments: the first acidic, the second alkaline. 4Electrochemistry applied to the study of the behaviour of mineral materials from hydrothermal vents is a valuable tool because it allows for a precise investigation of the reactivity of material surfaces and correlates it with their electronic structure. 5A hydrothermal vent system can be modelled as a short-circuited fuel cell, with a continuous flow of reactants to the electrodes. These electrodes are made of the material that forms the barrier and are located in two different environments: the first electrode functions as a cathode for the reduction of CO2 in an acidic environment, while the second functions as an anode for the oxidation of hydrogen (or other molecules) in an alkaline environment. An electric current is recorded between the two short-circuited electrodes. This coupling of reactions can be represented in an Evans diagram, analogous to a corrosion process.Figure 1. Evans diagram in various conditionFigure 2. Short circuited fuel cell model of AHTVIn our laboratory, we developed a technique for synthesizing Mackinawite (FeSm) and Violarite (FeNi2S4). The samples have been characterized using spectroscopic, microscopic, and electrochemical methods. Using these materials, we have prepared electrodes for testing. A series of electrolysis experiments have demonstrated that these materials can electrochemically reduce CO2 at negative potentials as -1.2 V, producing formic acid, methanol, and carbon monoxide. The efficiency of this reaction decreases significantly when less extreme potentials are applied.&amp;#160;Figure 3. Production of formic acid and methanol during a potentiostatic electrolysis on Mackinawite or Violarite.The behaviour of the electrodes was studied by recording Tafel plots (log(I) vs E) and creating an Evans diagram. This diagram illustrates the operational conditions of pH, catalytic material, and reaction environment under which it is possible to couple the CO2 reduction and hydrogen oxidation reactions effectively. Subsequently, the short-circuited fuel cell was constructed, allowing for the measurement of the current flow (which is proportional to the reaction rate and indicates the cell's polarity) and the electric potential at which the coupled reactions occur.The results indicate that once the short-circuited fuel cell is assembled, in the absence of reactants and without a pH difference between the two compartments, no current is registered, suggesting that no reaction is occurring. However, upon introducing the CO2 and H2 reactants into their respective compartments, a pH gradient (6.5 vs 8.8) is established. Under these conditions, a reaction current is observed, with its direction indicating reduction at the pole containing CO2 and oxidation at the pole with H2. The potential at which this coupling occurs, on the synthesized metal sulphides materials, is -0.03 V vs SHE (@ pH 6.5), a value too positive to promote the CO2 reduction reaction. The limiting factor in this setup is the anodic reaction, so other conditions have been tested for improving the catalytic activity of the anode, changing electrolyte composition and pH, flux of reactant and even the composition of the electrode itself. For example, using platinum as the anode (a material known for its catalytic properties in reactions involving hydrogen), a coupling potential of -0.44 V is observed, a value within the range where the reduction reaction of CO2 at the cathode can occur.This approach to measurement and interpretation of Alkaline Hydrothermal Vent functioning represents, in our opinion, a groundbreaking development in the field of studies on this topic. The future challenge lies in identifying the optimal operational conditions that accurately simulate the real environment of an alkaline hydrothermal vent on the Archean ocean floor, capable of facilitating a spontaneous reduction reaction of CO2.References1.Russell, M.

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has recently attracted increasing attention of chemists for converting CO2 to value&#8208;added chemicals with the assistance of electrical energy. Over the past decades, substantial efforts have been devoted to CO2RR, however, this process still suffers the challenges of low conversion and poor selectivity to target product due to the thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of CO2. Among those catalysts, Cu has been widely used for CO2RR to produce hydrocarbons with relatively high efficiency in spite of the poor selectivity to products. Therefore, it is highly desired to developed highly active and selective Cu based catalysts for CO2RR. This mini&#8208;review will summary the recent advances on CO2RR over Cu&#8208;based nanocrystals (NCs) with a special focus on the control of selectivity of product via surface modification. We hope this mini&#8208;review will motivate chemists to develop efficient catalysts for CO2RR, and also promote the fundamental research on catalyst design in heterogeneous catalysis.</description>

                Elucidating the relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions helps promote the coordinated and synergistic development of the economy and the environment. This study utilizes the Tapio decoupling model to analyze the decoupling relationship between economic growth rate and CO2 emissions in 14 cities of Liaoning Province from 2005 to 2020. Additionally, a model is established with the aim of determining CO2 reduction targets for achieving strong or weak decoupling states. Results showed that although most cities showed a strong or weak decoupling state, the decoupling performance in specific year was not ideal, the proportion of negative decoupling increased from 2017 to 2020. Liaoning Province faces significant challenges in decoupling economic growth rate from CO2 emissions, it needs to reduce its CO2 emissions (CE) by 5659.33 107 Kg or 5397.80 107 Kg to achieve strong or weak decoupling, respectively. Among the 14 cities, 8 cities have not achieved strong or weak decoupling. Cities such as Anshan, Yingkou, and Benxi face the greatest challenges, with a minimum required reduction of 25.72% in CE, 41.77% in Carbon Emissions per Capita, and 16.62% in Carbon Emissions per Unit of GDP. The research results can provide theoretical support for improving energy efficiency.</description>

                Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (ECO2RR), a pivotal process converting CO2 into high-value products, plays a crucial role in advancing objectives of carbon neutrality. Within various catalysts, copper-based electrocatalysts hold a unique position as they demonstrate a remarkable aptitude for producing high-carbon (C2 + ) products. Notably, the well-established Cu+ sites exhibit robust C-C coupling capabilities, particularly in the synthesis of C2H4 products. However, the challenge lies in maintaining the stability of oxide-derived copper under the negative potential operating conditions. In light of this, we use the ion exchange principle to make Al partially replace Cu-BDC, and then get a dopant by high temperature calcination to prepare Al-doped CuO catalyst. It has been demonstrated that the introduction of oxyphilic Al atoms could induce the redistribution of electrons in the CuO matrix and stabilize the presence of Cu+ in the ECO2RR process. This configuration significantly enhances the catalytic performance of CuO for electrochemically converting CO2 into C2H4. Specifically, the optimized Al-CuO catalyst exhibits a faradaic efficiency for C2H4 (FEC2H4) of &#8764; 50 % at &#8722;1.377 V vs. RHE, doubling the performance compared to pure CuO. The design and implementation of doping engineering presented in this work propel advancements in the field of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction for C2H4 production, offering a crucial avenue for the development of efficient catalysts.</description>

                In this work, gold-photo-catalyzed CO2 transformation was conducted and the effect of three variables with two levels was investigated: support (TiO2 and hydroxyapatite from bovine bone (BB)), Au content (5 and 10%) and activation wavelength (254 and 380&#8211;700 nm). Reactions were conducted in a stirred tank reactor by bubbling CO2 (9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 dm3/min) in 0.1 dm3 of 0.5 M NaOH solution. The catalysts were synthesized using AuCl3, TiO2 and BB. Au nanoparticles were obtained by reduction with Hetheroteca inuloides, thus eliminating calcination and hydrogenation to reduce the gold species. By TEM, the particle size distribution was determined, and the synthesized nanoparticle sizes varied in the range of 9 to 19 nm, depending on the support and Au content. By UV&#8211;Vis spectroscopy, the energy band gaps of the prepared materials were 2.18 eV (10% Au/BB), 2.38 eV (5% Au/BB), 2.42 eV (BB), 3.39 eV (5% Au/TiO2), 3.41 eV (10% Au/TiO2) and 3.43 eV for pure TiO2. Methanol and formic and acetic acids were identified during the process. Selectivity toward methanol was found to be improved with the 10% Au/BB catalytic system.</description>

      <title>On the discrepancy of using annual or hourly emission factors for power generation to estimate CO2 reduction of building retrofitting</title>

                Buildings play a significant role in global carbon emissions, and offer substantial potential for energy savings and emission reduction. This research delves into the Emission Factor Discrepancy (EFD)&#8212;the variance in CO2 emission reduction projections obtained by employing either annual or hourly average Emission Factor (EF) for electricity generation. Through two detailed case studies in the Netherlands and incorporating emission data from the Netherlands, Sweden, and France, the study uncovers the potential magnitude and country-specific variability of the EFD. By demonstrating how the energy mix of a country influences the EFD, the research offers valuable insights into the accuracy of emission calculations for different circumstances, particularly in the context of transitioning to renewable energy sources. We have found that countries with energy sources having low load-following capability and low EFs exhibit a large EFD. Whereas, countries with high EFs and large deployment of Photovoltaics (PV) show a notably large EFD on emission reduction related to PV production. This highlights the importance of carefully selecting EFs when evaluating building retrofits in the context of smart city initiatives. This research highlights the need for establishing a uniform framework for calculating carbon emissions associated with retrofitting in buildings in conjunction with the granularity of data and the specific energy mix of a country.</description>

                Abstract Visible-light activation of photocatalysts is crucial for effectively utilizing solar energy in molecular conversions. This study demonstrates that modifying the bipyridine ligand with carbazole enables visible-light activation of a Ru(II) carbonyl complex catalyst, which is originally developed as an electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction but inactive as a photocatalyst on its own. The present study opens avenues for individually designing light-absorbing ligands and catalytic functions within one mononuclear complex.</description>

      <title>Assessing the CO2 Emissions and Energy Source Consumption Nexus in Japan</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16135742</link>
      <description>Kentaka Aruga, MN Islam, Arifa Jannat, Sustainability. 16(13)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400351835

                This research investigates the variation in the impact of different energy sources on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Japan during the period from January 2019 to March 2023. The results of the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model suggest that a 1% increase in energy consumption produced through the photovoltaic (PV) decreases carbon emission by 0.053% in the short-run. Conversely, a 1% increase in coal, oil, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) leads to an increase in CO2 emissions by 0.317%, 0.038%, and 0.214%, respectively. The study also reveals an inverted-U-shaped relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth, represented by the Nikkei stock index. The research emphasizes the critical need for Japan to prioritize investments and incentives in renewable energy technologies such as the PV systems, which have been demonstrated to effectively reduce CO2 emissions in Japan. This is essential to uphold long-term ecological balance and to proactively support the ongoing reduction in CO2 intensity, a key objective outlined in the Paris Agreement.</description>

      <title>Effects of Biochar on Gaseous Carbon and Nitrogen Emissions in Paddy Fields: A Review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy14071461</link>
      <description>Yidi Sun, Xuetao Wang, Chenxia Yang, Xiaoping Xin, Junlin Zheng, Tao Zong, Chaoyin Dou, Agronomy. 14(7)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400351960

                The paddy field is a major source of gaseous carbon and nitrogen emissions, and reducing these emissions is of great significance for mitigating greenhouse effects and non-point source pollution in farmland. Biochar, derived from agricultural waste, possesses a stable structure, large specific surface area, abundant pore structures, and surface functional groups. These characteristics could enhance soil physicochemical properties and microbial activity, thereby facilitating the dual goals of increasing crop yield and reducing emissions. Based on numerous studies, this review summarizes the effects of biochar on the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ammonia volatilization (NH3), as well as on global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI). It elucidates the mechanism of emission reduction by biochar amendment from the perspective of carbon and nitrogen conversion processes and soil physicochemical and biological properties. Numerous studies showed the application of 5~40 t ha&#8722;1 biochar reduced CO2, CH4, N2O, and NH3 emissions by 1.64~89.6%, 8.6~89.6%, 10~90%, and 12.27~53%, respectively. A small number of studies found that the application of 5~48 t ha&#8722;1 biochar increased CO2, CH4, N2O, and NH3 emissions by 12~37%, 19.85~176%, 13~84.23%, and 5.47~70.9%, respectively. Most scholars have found that biochar has varying degrees of emission reduction capabilities in different parts of the world. Therefore, future research directions have been suggested for utilizing biochar to reduce carbon and nitrogen emissions in paddy fields.</description>

                The humongous increase in carbon emissions in the past few decades presents an environmental challenge to the scientific community. The current study proposes a method of taxation on high-carbon emission fuels. For this purpose, a comparative enviro-economic analysis is carried out on the three most commonly used fuels (gasoline, Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)). The speed of the test engine varied from 1800 to 4200 Revolution per Minute (RPM) in increments of 400 RPM. Performance parameters (Brake Power (BP), Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTHE), and Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC)) were measured using a hydro dynamometer. Emission analysis, including Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Unburned Hydrocarbons (HC), and Nitrogen Oxide (NOx), was conducted using the TESTO 350 analyzer. The application of Weibull distribution with a 95 % confidence interval, on emission data, explained the adequacy of the data. Among test fuels, CNG emerged as an environment-friendly fuel with an emission reduction of 16, 42, and 43 percent for CO2, CO, and HC in comparison to gasoline. Also, BTHE and BSFC of CNG were better than other alternatives. Moreover, the carbon penalty for CNG fuel showed a price reduction of 32 and 20.8 percent in comparison to gasoline and LPG respectively. The study provides a novel approach to assess the environmental impact of fuels by economic analysis based on emitted carbon quantity. In addition, this very idea is novel in promoting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the United Nations (UN) through carbon taxation.</description>

                Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are gases released into the atmosphere from various human activities on earth which cause a greenhouse effect in the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen monoxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), methane gas (CH4), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFC). Carbon gas as the main pollutant is produced from burning oil, coal and other organic fuels. To reduce this negative impact, each country then ratified the Paris Agreement and committed to keeping the temperature increase to less than 2 degrees Celsius. In this regard, each country targets reducing GHG emissions, especially carbon, within a certain period of time. The Indonesian government has set a target to reduce carbon emissions from all sectors by 2030 by 29 percent with its own efforts or up to 41 percent with funding assistance from abroad. In the 41% reduction target, the government hopes to collaborate with developed countries that have high levels of carbon emissions, through a "carbon trading" mechanism. This research explains the implementation of policies to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions using the Edwards III approach. The indicators are Communication, Disposition, Resources and Bureaucratic Structure. The research method used is qualitative, descriptive analysis type. Data collection through literature study. Data was obtained from e-books, journals and articles</description>

      <title>The Nexus between Financial Development and Carbon Emission in OIC Countries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21111/iej.v10i1.12201</link>
      <description>Mohammad Zen Nasrudin Fajri, Ikhsanul Amal, Abdul Fareed Delawari, Ahmad Suminto, Islamic economics journal. 10(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400307659

                Economic activities are important factors for the development of countries. However, many countries give too much importance to the economy without paying attention to the country's environment as a result of ongoing economic activities, such as industrial, electricity production, transportation, and commercial and residential which can cause environmental degradation with the spread of CO2 carbon dioxide emissions. The growth of a financial sector that supports those economic activities is considered the driver of carbon emissions at the macro level. However, Islam teaches Muslims to avoid corruption on earth including those leading to the rise in carbon emissions. This makes Muslim-majority countries have better concern in dealing with carbon emissions. This study aims to analyze the influences of financial institution index (FII) and financial market index (FII) on carbon dioxide emissions in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation member nations. Using the GMM estimator for a panel dataset of 36 countries between 2000 and 2021, this study unravels that the FII significantly increased carbon emissions in OIC countries. In reverse, FMI contributed to the reduction of carbon emissions in OIC countries. This paper recommends the government set regulations for banking sectors to improve eco-friendly credits for the private sector. It is also recommended that the government enrich the issuance of green securities and strengthen the financial market because it is effective in minimizing carbon emissions.</description>

      <title>Lignite reduces carbon and nitrogen loss from litter in commercial broiler housing</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.142763</link>

                The loss of carbon and nitrogen from broiler litter limits nutrient recycling and is damaging to the environment. This study investigated lignite, a low-rank brown coal, as an amendment to reduce the loss of carbon and nitrogen from broiler litter over 3 consecutive grow-out cycles, November 2021 to May 2022, at a commercially operated farm in Victoria, Australia. Lignite-treated litter contained significantly more carbon and nitrogen, with an increase of 70.1 g/bird and 12.6 g/bird for carbon and nitrogen, respectively. Lignite also reduced aerobic microbial respiration, with a 46.0% reduction in CO2 flux recorded in week 7 of the study, resulting in reduced mass loss. It is expected that this is a key mechanism responsible for nutrient retention in litter following treatment with lignite. Furthermore, lignite treatment lowered litter moisture content by 7, 6 and 3 percentage points for grow-out 1, 2 and 3, respectively. These findings present lignite as a beneficial litter amendment for increasing the nutrient value of waste and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The study highlights the potential of lignite to reduce the environmental impact of poultry production and presents an alternative use for lignite as an existing resource.</description>

                The need to reduce vehicle emissions has encouraged the development of various solutions. One of them is the steam injection method, which proved to be an effective option of reducing NOx emissions. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the steam injection method on an agricultural engine, appropriate tests were carried out at the Alternative Fuels Research Laboratory of the Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies. The engine KDI 1903M and a self-made steam device ensuring steam injection in the intake manifold were used in the tests. The research engine was connected to the SIERRA CP-Engineering engine test bench. Additionally, emissions were recorded by the AVL SESAM FTIR exhaust gas analytical system. Testing was performed without steam supply and with steam supply at constant speeds, as well as in different load modes - 10 kW and 20 kW. The results showed that the largest reduction of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions was obtained at idling (7.5%), while in case of all load modes the results were very similar (reduction by 4.1-5.0%). At the same time, increase of carbon monoxide (CO) emissions was observed in all testing modes by 3.0-5.6%, while carbon dioxide (CO2) changes were negligible. The studies confirmed an insignificant increase in the power and torque. The results prove that further research should increase the volume of steam supply by improving the given device.</description>

                Abstract This study examines the geospatial locations of energy stations within Port-Harcourt Aba expressway to ascertain their locations if it conforms to standard practice. It also took into cognizance the in-situ monitoring of the various air pollutants within the vicinity of the energy stations. The study location is in Obio/Akpor and Port Harcourt city Local Government Area, Rivers State. The result of the proximity analysis reveals that the energy stations do not fall within the standard of 15metres specified by DPR (Department of Petroleum Resources). The various pollutants examined are PM 10, PM 2.5, carbon monoxide (Co), Nitrogen Dioxide (No2), ground level ozone (O3), and sulphur dioxide (S02). The result reveals that their concentrations values fall within the permissible limit as specified by NESREA except (C02) which is the primary pollutant was extremely highly than the permissible limit of 400 (ppm). This can be attributed to the influx of vehicles that buys fuel from the energy stations. The concentration of (C02) poses a serious health effect on the pump attendants due to their constant inhaling of the pollutants. The study concludes that energy stations should be cited at the approved DPR standard of (15metres) and actionable measures should be put in place to aid in the reduction of CO2 within the energy stations. Finally, the study recommends that there should be strict compliance to DPR standard in the siting of energy stations.</description>

      <title>Molecular Targeting of the Isocitrate Dehydrogenase Pathway and the Implications for Cancer Therapy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25137337</link>
      <description>Stanislav Ivanov, Olger Nano, Caroline Hana, Amalia Bonano-Rios, Atif M. Hussein, International journal of molecular sciences. 25(13)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400324206

                The advent of comprehensive genomic profiling using next-generation sequencing (NGS) has unveiled an abundance of potentially actionable genetic aberrations that have shaped our understanding of the cancer biology landscape. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is an enzyme present in the cytosol (IDH1) and mitochondria (IDH2 and IDH3). In the mitochondrion, it catalyzes the irreversible oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, yielding the production of &#945;-ketoglutarate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as well as carbon dioxide (CO2). In the cytosol, IDH catalyzes the decarboxylation of isocitrate to &#945;-ketoglutarate as well as the reverse reductive carboxylation of &#945;-ketoglutarate to isocitrate. These rate-limiting steps in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, as well as the cytoplasmic response to oxidative stress, play key roles in gene regulation, cell differentiation, and tissue homeostasis. Mutations in the genes encoding IDH1 and IDH2 and, less commonly, IDH3 have been found in a variety of cancers, most commonly glioma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chondrosarcoma, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In this paper, we intend to elucidate the theorized pathophysiology behind IDH isomer mutation, its implication in cancer manifestation, and discuss some of the available clinical data regarding the use of novel IDH inhibitors and their role in therapy.</description>

                A three-year beef cow grazing study (2020-2022) was conducted to evaluate the effects of biochar supplementation on grazing cow performance, ruminal fermentation, fecal egg and oocyst count, fecal nutrient composition, and enteric methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Each year, forty-eight spring-calving Angus beef cows (BW = 669 &amp;plusmn; 95 kg; mean &amp;plusmn; STD) stratified by BW, were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments. Treatments included either (i) pelleted supplement with biochar (Biochar; 405 g/d) inclusion at 2.2% of DMI or (ii) control pellet (Control; base fiber - no biochar). Twenty-four ha meadow bromegrass (Bromus riparius Rehm.)-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) paddocks (8.6% CP, 51.1% TDN) were assigned to each treatment group for the 92-d grazing trial. Enteric CH4 and CO2 emissions were measured using SF6 tracer gas technique. Cow and calf performance, rumen fluid parameters were not (p &amp;gt; 0.05) affected by biochar supplementation. During trial biochar supplementation reduced fecal oocyst (Eimeria spp.) count (p &amp;lt; 0.011; 3.9 vs. 15.0 count/g DM) but increased carbon:nitrogen ratio (p &amp;lt; 0.029; 26.1 vs. 21.3) relative to initial measurements. The enteric methane emission reduction in response to biochar supplementation at 2.2% of DMI, was negligible (~6.0% reduced compared to control).</description>

      <title>Kinetics of In-Situ Calcium Magnesium Carbonate Precipitation and the Need for Desulfation in Seawater-Flooded Carbonate Reservoirs</title>

                Summary Mixing of incompatible injection and formation brines leads to the deposition of inorganic sulfate scales such as barite, celestite, and anhydrite in and around production wells. This process is well documented in seawater-flooded clastic reservoirs. One technique to avoid the resulting formation damage is to remove sulfate from seawater before injection using nanofiltration; however, this process is costly. We identify in this paper that it may not always be necessary in higher-temperature carbonate reservoirs. In this paper, we describe the use of reactive transport reservoir simulation to investigate the impact of carbon dioxide (CO2) partitioning and changes in pH, ionic concentrations, and temperature on carbonate reactivity and the sulfate scaling risk in waterflooded carbonate reservoirs. Dissolution and precipitation of calcite, dolomite, gypsum, anhydrite, barite, and celestite are all modeled and found to be coupled through (various) common ion effects. The produced brine compositions are used to calculate the saturation ratios (SRs) and mass of precipitate that may form in the production system. Sensitivity to mineral reaction kinetics, particularly for the dolomite reactions, is accounted for. Results identify that there is a strong relationship between calcite dissolution and dolomite (or other calcium/magnesium carbonate mineral) precipitation reactions, which drive each other and are affected by the availability of CO2 in the residual oil phase. This evolves over time, and as the thermal front propagates, impacts the concentration of calcium and magnesium in the brines traversing the reservoir. Temperature changes around the injection wellbore impact CO2 and mineral solubilities. The concentration of calcium in the displaced brine mix is thus determined more by contact with rock and temperature than by mixing between injection and formation brines. Depending on location relative to the thermal front, this may lead to gypsum or anhydrite precipitation, thereby stripping sulfate out of the injection brine. Thus, the sulfate scaling risk at the production wells is significantly reduced by this sulfate depletion process: The sulfate is stripped out of the seawater as it warms up in the reservoir before it mixes extensively with the formation water and significantly before any mixture of the two brines reaches the production zone. Thus, any loss of permeability is restricted to deep within the reservoir, where the pore volume (PV) that can accommodate mineral precipitation is very large. In this work, we identify that for carbonate reservoirs above 90&#8211;100&#176;C, stripping of sulfate due to coupled mineral reactions may reduce or eliminate the need for use of a sulfate reduction plant (SRP). The process is modeled for the first time, accounting for the impact of CO2 partitioning and thermal front propagation. Knowledge of the kinetics of calcium/magnesium carbonate precipitation is shown to be critical in predicting the extent of sulfate depletion.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis of a SiO2 submicron-particles-based relative humidity sensor for planetary research applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2024-936</link>
      <description>Michelle Cede&#241;o Mata, Abel Palomas, X. Manyosa, Ana Coloma, Manuel Dom&#237;nguez-Pumar, Sandra Bermejo, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400289591

                PurposeThis work presents the development and analysis of a SiO2 composite ionic liquid gel polymer electrolyte (SiO2-CILGPE)-based capacitor in air and carbon dioxide (CO2) atmospheres. The effectiveness of the proposed layer as a humidity-sensitive layer has been demonstrated in [1]. Its use as a humidity sensing layer not only stands out among other alternatives due to its sensing performance, but also because of its cost-effectiveness, scalability, and non-toxicity. In this realm, this study exhibits a brief comparison of the impedance characteristics of the proposed device under air and CO2 conditions, aiming to examine a first insight into the impact of CO2 onits electrical behaviour to evaluate its potential use as a relative humidity sensor for planetary research applications, such the ones carried out in Mars for habitability studies.&amp;#160;Methodology Figure 1 illustrates the fabrication process of the SiO2 CILGPE. The fabrication starts by dissolving the host polymers (HPs) in deionised water at 70 &amp;#186;C. Then, a blend of CH&amp;#8323;COONH&amp;#8324; and 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide is incorporated and stirred at 70 &amp;#186;C. Afterwards, SiO&amp;#8322; nanoparticles are embedded in the resultant ILGPE using an ultrasound bath until a homogenous mixture is achieved. Finally, the resulting electrolyte is deposited onto the active electrode area using drop-casting and subsequently cured, forming a layer with a thickness of around 600 &amp;#956;m and length and width of 0.4 mm and 1mm, respectively.The humidity sensing performance of the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor was evaluated using the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique under different humidity conditions at atmospheric pressure. The impedimetric response has been obtained using the impedance module values, while the capacitance response has been calculated using Equation 1:&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; C = -&amp;#119885;&amp;#8242;&amp;#8242;/( 2&amp;#120587; &amp;#119891;&amp;#119885;2) &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160; &amp;#160;&amp;#160; (Eq. 1)&amp;#160;Where &amp;#119885; and &amp;#119885;&amp;#8242;&amp;#8242; are the module and imaginary part of the impedance, respectively.Furthermore, EIS measurements under air and CO2 conditions at different pressures have been carried out and compared to evaluate its behaviour under a CO2 atmosphere. This evaluation starts with air evacuation until a partial vacuum, reducing the concentration of air. This first part of the process provides information about the impact of pressure variations on the electrical behaviour of the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor under air conditions. Once 0.1 mbar is reached, CO2 is injected in a controlled and gradual manner. This second step stimulates an increase in the internal pressure of the chamber and allows a preliminary analysis of how the quantity of CO2 can impact the impedimetric characteristics of the device. This methodology enables the characterisation of the SiO2-CILGPE-based capacitor under different conditions of pressure and gas composition, thereby providing initial insights into how the presence of different gases affects its performance. The exhibited EIS measurements can be fitted using the equivalent circuit (EC) displayed in Figure 4. The analysis of EIS data from ECs could allow a first insight into the understanding of the impact of CO2 on the sensing mechanism and performance of the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor.&amp;#160;ResultsFigure 2 illustrates the obtained Z and capacitance humidity sensing responses. As can be noticed, the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor reveals changes in two parameters, increasing its reliability compared to other relative humidity sensors in the literature and offering more information that could facilitate the calibration process.Following the analysis of the EIS data, Figure 3 compares the obtained impedance module, phase, and capacitance spectra under air and CO2 atmospheres. It is noticeable that the curves of the three parameters of the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor exhibit the same trend under the presence of both gases, thereby suggesting the SiO2 CILGPE layer could work similarly under air and CO2.Nevertheless, the characterised parameters reveal opposite shifts in response to pressure variations. Firstly, under an air atmosphere, it can be noticed that a reduction in the pressure implies an increase in the impedance module and a decrease in the capacitance. This behaviour could be ascribed to a reduction of the water vapour molecules since reducing the pressure inside the measurement chamber also implies a reduction in the partial pressure of all gases, including water vapour [2]. Reducing the water molecules promotes a decrease in the number of charge carriers within the humidity-sensitive layer and, hence, an increase in the impedance and a decrease in the capacitance. Conversely, under a CO2 atmosphere, the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor depicts an increase in the impedance module values and a reduction in the capacitance when increasing the pressure. This finding might be attributed to the injection of CO2 into the vacuumed chamber. One possible explanation for such phenomena is that introducing CO2 into the chamber increases the pressure, thereby could reduce the water vapour concentration relative to the total gas, promoting a decrease in the relative humidity. Consequently, the obtained impedance spectra suggest that the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor could possess the same response to relative humidity variations under the presence of air and CO2. Further research should focus on investigating and analysing the impact of CO2 presence under different relative humidity levels.&amp;#160;ConclusionsEIS measurements show that, under air and CO2 conditions, the SiO2 CILGPE-based capacitor exhibits similar impedance, phase, and capacitance curve trends, thereby suggesting the SiO2 CILGPE layer could operate following similar electrical behaviours under CO2. Additionally, this comparison shows that a reduction in the relative humidity could imply the same response under air and CO2 atmospheres. Therefore, it might suggest that CO2 does not alter the dominant sensing mechanism.Consequently, this work provides first insights into the possible potential of a non-toxic, cost-effective alternative based on a SiO2 CILGPE as a sensing layer for humidity sensing in CO2 atmospheres.AcknowledgementsThis work has been supported by the projects TED2021-131552B-C22 and PID2021-126719OB-C42.References[1]&amp;#160; Cede&amp;#241;o Mata, M.; Orpella, A.; Dominguez-Pumar, M.; Bermejo, S.

                Human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII) naturally catalyzes the reaction between two achiral molecules &#8211; water and carbon dioxide &#8211; to yield the achiral product carbonic acid through a zinc hydroxide intermediate. We have previously shown that a zinc hydride, instead of a hydroxide, can be generated in this enzyme to create a catalyst for the reduction of aryl ketones. Dialkyl ketones are more challenging to reduce, and the enantioselective reduction of dialkyl ketones with two alkyl groups that are similar in size and electronic properties, is a particularly challenging transformation to achieve with high activity and selectivity. Here, we show that hCAII, as well as a double variant of it, catalyzes the enantioselective reduction of dialkyl ketones with high yields and enantioselectivities, even when the two alkyl groups are similar in size. We also show that variants of hCAII catalyze the site&#8208;selective reduction of one ketone over the other in an unsymmetrical aliphatic diketone. Computational docking of a dialkyl ketone to the double variant containing the zinc hydride provides insights into the origins of the reactivity of various substrates and the high enantioselectivity of the transformations and show how a confined environment can control the enantioselectivity of an abiological intermediate</description>

                Abstract It is now widely recognized that net zero by 2050 transition cannot be achieved without major reductions in carbon emissions from the building and the related infrastructure development sector including both from building operations and from carbon embedded in construction materials. Collectively the construction and operation of buildings are one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Reductions need to occur quickly since buildings constructed today will likely still be in service well beyond 2070 and most existing buildings will remain in service in 2050. Transitioning to net zero buildings are also likely to have a significant impact on several areas of natural resources law including land use, construction and infrastructure development law, energy security, environment, zoning, procurement, and energy solidarity. This chapter focuses on the legal and policy challenges in pursuing net zero buildings strategies that can dramatically reduce the role of buildings in climate change.</description>

      <title>Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal With the Hemolung in Patients With Acute-on-Chronic Respiratory Failure: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1097/mat.0000000000002155</link>

                Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) devices are increasingly used in treating acute-on-chronic respiratory failure caused by chronic lung diseases. There are no large studies that investigated safety, efficacy, and the independent association of prognostic variables to survival that could define the role of ECCO2R devices in such patients. This multicenter, multinational, retrospective study investigated the efficacy, safety of a single ECCO2R device (Hemolung) in patients with acute on chronic respiratory failure and identified variables independently associated with intensive care unit (ICU) survival. The primary outcome was improvement in blood gasses with the use of Hemolung. Secondary outcomes included reduction in tidal volume, respiratory rate, minute ventilation, survival to ICU discharge, and complication profile. Multivariable regression analysis was used to identify variables that are independently associated with ICU survival. A total of 62 patients were included. There was a significant improvement in pH and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2) along with a reduction in respiratory rate, tidal volume, and minute ventilation with Hemolung therapy. The complication profile did not differ between survivors and nonsurvivors. Multivariable analysis identified the duration of Hemolung therapy to be independently associated with survival to ICU discharge (adjusted odds ratio = 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.040-1.518; p = 0.01).</description>

      <title>The Science, Engineering, and Validation of Marine Carbon Dioxide Removal and Storage</title>

                Scenarios to stabilize global climate and meet international climate agreements require rapid reductions in human carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, often augmented by substantial carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere. While some ocean-based removal techniques show potential promise as part of a broader CDR and decarbonization portfolio, no marine approach is ready yet for deployment at scale because of gaps in both scientific and engineering knowledge. Marine CDR spans a wide range of biotic and abiotic methods, with both common and technique-specific limitations. Further targeted research is needed on CDR efficacy, permanence, and additionality as well as on robust validation methods&#8212;measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification&#8212;that are essential to demonstrate the safe removal and long-term storage of CO 2 . Engineering studies are needed on constraints including scalability, costs, resource inputs, energy demands, and technical readiness. Research on possible co-benefits, ocean acidification effects, environmental and social impacts, and governance is also required.</description>

      <title>Deep Low-Carbon Economic Optimization Using CCUS and Two-Stage P2G with Multiple Hydrogen Utilizations for an Integrated Energy System with a High Penetration Level of Renewables</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16135722</link>
      <description>Junqiu Fan, Jing Zhang, Long Yuan, Rujing Yan, Yu He, Weixing Zhao, Nicol&#225;s Nin, Sustainability. 16(13)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400365975

                Integrating carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology into an integrated energy system (IES) can reduce its carbon emissions and enhance its low-carbon performance. However, the full CCS of flue gas displays a strong coupling between lean and rich liquor as carbon dioxide liquid absorbents. Its integration into IESs with a high penetration level of renewables results in insufficient flexibility and renewable curtailment. In addition, integrating split-flow CCS of flue gas facilitates a short capture time, giving priority to renewable energy. To address these limitations, this paper develops a carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) method, into which storage tanks for lean and rich liquor and a two-stage power-to-gas (P2G) system with multiple utilizations of hydrogen including a fuel cell and a hydrogen-blended CHP unit are introduced. The CCUS is integrated into an IES to build an electricity&#8211;heat&#8211;hydrogen&#8211;gas IES. Accordingly, a deep low-carbon economic optimization strategy for this IES, which considers stepwise carbon trading, coal consumption, renewable curtailment penalties, and gas purchasing costs, is proposed. The effects of CCUS, the two-stage P2G system, and stepwise carbon trading on the performance of this IES are analyzed through a case-comparative analysis. The results show that the proposed method allows for a significant reduction in both carbon emissions and total operational costs. It outperforms the IES without CCUS with an 8.8% cost reduction and a 70.11% reduction in carbon emissions. Compared to the IES integrating full CCS, the proposed method yields reductions of 6.5% in costs and 24.7% in emissions. Furthermore, the addition of a two-stage P2G system with multiple utilizations of hydrogen further amplifies these benefits, cutting costs by 13.97% and emissions by 12.32%. In addition, integrating CCUS into IESs enables the full consumption of renewables and expands hydrogen utilization, and the renewable consumption proportion in IESs can reach 69.23%.</description>

                Abstract The Aeolian archipelago is known worldwide for its volcanic activity and hydrothermal emissions, of mainly carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen, methane, and carbon monoxide are minor components of these emissions which together can feed large quantities of bacteria and archaea that do contribute to the removal of these notorious greenhouse gases. Here we analyzed the metagenome of samples taken from the Levante bay on Vulcano Island, Italy. Using a gene-centric approach, the hydrothermal vent community appeared to be dominated by Proteobacteria , and Sulfurimonas was the most abundant genus. Metabolic reconstructions highlight a prominent role of formaldehyde oxidation and the reverse TCA cycle in carbon fixation. [NiFe]-hydrogenases seemed to constitute the preferred strategy to oxidize H 2 , indicating that besides H 2 S, H 2 could be an essential electron donor in this system. Moreover, the sulfur cycle analysis showed a high abundance and diversity of sulfate reduction genes underpinning the H 2 S production. This study covers the diversity and metabolic potential of the microbial soil community in Levante bay and adds to our understanding of the biogeochemistry of volcanic ecosystems.</description>

                Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an innovative class of crystalline porous polymers composed of light elements such as C, N, O, etc., linked by covalent bonds. The distinctive properties of COFs, including designable building blocks, large specific surface area, tunable pore size, abundant active sites, and remarkable stability, have led their widespread applications in electrocatalysis. In recent years, COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts have made remarkable progress in various electrocatalytic fields, including the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, nitrate reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. This review begins with an introduction to the design and synthesis strategies employed for COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts. These strategies include heteroatom doping, metalation of COF and building monomers, encapsulation of active sites within COF pores, and the development of COF&#8208;based derived materials. Subsequently, a systematic overview of the recent advancements in the application of COF&#8208;based catalysts in electrocatalysis is presented. Finally, the review discusses the main challenges and outlines possible avenues for the future development of COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted significant attention for electrocatalytic energy conversion by virtue of their promisingly high efficiency, stability, and low cost. Recently, encouraging progress has been made in tuning the structure and composition of HEAs used in electrolyzers and fuel cells. However, the understanding on the synthetic methods and the structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship of well&#8208;defined HEAs nanostructures is still inadequate. To gain insight into the future research directions on HEAs for electrocatalysis, in this paper, the synthetic methods commonly used to obtain well&#8208;defined HEAs nanostructures (0D nanoparticles, 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets/nanoplates, 3D nanoporous structures, and other three&#8208;dimensional morphologies) are first summarized. Then, the authors discuss the application of well&#8208;defined HEAs nanostructures in several typical electrocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, alcohol oxidation reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and formic acid oxidation reaction. Finally, a practical perspective on the future research directions on well&#8208;defined HEAs nanostructured electrocatalysts is provided.</description>

                Carbon dioxide emissions are among the most influential causes of global warming, and the recovery, capture, and comprehensive utilization of CO 2 are the keys to carbon emissions reduction. High-porosity foam concrete was prepared using CaO as the alkali activator, and H 2 O 2 as the foaming agent. Based on a single-factor experiment and response surface analysis, the best preparation conditions for foam concrete were obtained (water-to-cement ratio 0.4, alkali excitation dosage 10.73%, foaming agent dosage 8.26%). The porous material prepared under the optimal process conditions can achieve a CO 2 sequestration performance of 91.59 kg/m 3 , and the actual sequestration capacity is consistent with the theoretical prediction value of 90.89 kg/m 3 . Mechanistic analysis shows that the precarbonation hydration products of foam concrete are mainly C-S-H gel, Ca(OH) 2 , and hydrotalcite-like compounds, which bond the slag particles together to form a three-dimensional spatially firmly connected structure. This study provides a reference for the application of alkaline solid waste materials in the field of carbon sequestration.</description>

                Algae catalyze half of the global solar powered reduction of carbon dioxide to organic molecules. While this organic synthesis shapes genomes of heterotrophic microbiota globally, many corresponding structures remain elusive. We show that diatoms release a mannan polyelectrolyte selecting for bacteria with a specifically adapted enzymatic cascade. NMR spectroscopy, chromatography, automated glycan assembly and enzymatic dissection resolved the structure of a C6 sulfated &#945;-1,3-mannan with exceptional simplicity for a sulfated polysaccharide from algae. Biochemical, physiological and structural analyses demonstrated that some bacteria can hydrolyze this mannan with a cascade of just four enzymes. Circumnavigation metagenome data revealed corresponding genes in Atlantic, Pacific, Southern and Indian Ocean surface waters. We show that this sulfated mannan may exert substantial selection pressure on marine microbiota around the globe.</description>

      <title>The European Union Emissions Trading System might yield large co-benefits from pollution reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2319908121</link>

                Mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and reducing air pollution represent two pressing and interwoven environmental challenges. While international carbon markets, such as the European Union emissions trading system (EU ETS), have demonstrated their effectiveness in curbing carbon emissions (CO    2   ), their indirect impact on hazardous co-pollutants remains understudied. This study investigates how key toxic air pollutants&#8212;sulfur dioxide (SO    2   ), fine particulate matter (PM     2.5    ), and nitrogen oxides (NO    x   )&#8212;evolved after the introduction of the EU ETS with a comparative analysis of regulated and unregulated sectors. Leveraging the generalized synthetic control method, we offer an ex post analysis of how the EU ETS and concurrent emission standards may have jointly generated sizable pollution reductions in regulated sectors between 2005 and 2021. We provide an aggregate assessment that these pollution reductions could translate into large health co-benefits, potentially in the hundreds of billions of Euros, even when bounding the effect of emission standards. These order-of-magnitude estimates underscore key implications for policy appraisal and motivate further microlevel research around the health co-benefits of carbon abatement.</description>

      <description>Krenare Shahini Gollopeni, Jeton Mazllami, Multidisciplinary Science Journal. 6(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400349268

                Green finance, in contrast to traditional finance, has a close relationship with the environment and offers several advantages. This is why the study tries to illustrate how green financing affects environmental protection and evaluates its contribution to reducing environmental pollution. Green finance is an innovative method of funding with the goal of preserving the environment. It is crucial, widely discussed, and has caught the interest of many academics. They include programs that stimulate spending on initiatives aimed at minimizing adverse environmental effects. This study highlights the importance of green finance in environmental protection for the 36 OECD countries for the 11 years from 2010 to 2021. Panel data is used to derive results by applying models such as OLS, OLS Robust, Fixed effect, Random effects, and GMM. Empirical results according to the GMM method show that green finance has a positive impact on environmental protection, so the growth of green finance affects the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.</description>

                Converting dilute CO2 source into value-added chemicals and fuels is a promising route to reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emission, but integrating electrocatalysis with CO2 capture still faced marked challenges. Herein, we show that a self-healing metal&#8211;organic macrocycle functionalized as an electrochemical catalyst to selectively produce methane from flue gas and air with the lowest applied potential so far (0.06 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) through an enzymatic activation fashion. The capsule emulates the enzyme' pocket to abstract one in situ-formed CO2-adduct molecule with the commercial amino alcohols, forming an easy-to-reduce substrate-involving clathrate to combine the CO2 capture with electroreduction for a thorough CO2 reduction. We find that the self-healing system exhibited enzymatic kinetics for the first time with the Michaelis&#8211;Menten mechanism in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 and maintained a methane Faraday efficiency (FE) of 74.24% with a selectivity of over 99% for continuous operation over 200 h. A consecutive working lab at 50 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2, in an eleven-for-one (10 h working and 1 h healing) electrolysis manner, gives a methane turnover number (TON) of more than 10,000 within 100 h. The integrated electrolysis with CO2 capture facilitates the thorough reduction of flue gas (ca. 13.0% of CO2) and first time of air (ca. 400 ppm of CO2 to 42.7 mL CH4 from 1.0 m3 air). The new self-healing strategy of molecular electrocatalyst with an enzymatic activation manner and anodic shifting of the applied potentials provided a departure from the existing electrochemical catalytic techniques.</description>

      <title>Cation-Dependent Impact of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on Cu-Catalyzed Electrochemical CO Reduction Reaction</title>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) on Cu occurs via two tandem steps, i.e., the CO2-to-CO conversion and the electrochemical CO reduction reaction (CORR). Thus, Cu-catalyzed CO2RR on Cu is, in fact, coelectrolysis of CO2 and CO, which makes the impact of interfacial CO2 on the CORR a relevant factor in determining the overall CO2RR performance. In this work, we report the surprising observation that the effect of interfacial CO2 on the formation rate of C2+ products depends on the nature of cations in the electrolyte, i.e., beneficial with K+ and Cs+ while inhibitory with Li+ and Na+. Density functional theory calculations indicate that interfacial CO2&#948;&#8722; affects electrode-mediated reactions in two distinct modes with opposite effects, i.e., a general inhibitory effect of CO2&#948;&#8722; as an interfacial negatively charged species and a cation-specific promoting effect via direct CO2-cation interactions. The relative contributions of these two competing effects determine the overall impact of CO2 on the CORR. Furthermore, analysis of isotopologue distributions of products in the coelectrolysis of mixtures of 13CO/12CO2 reveals the influence of cations on the multiple steps of the CO2RR.</description>

      <title>A Multivariate Analysis of the Interplay between Energy Resources, Economic Growth, and Financial Stability. Evidence from Azerbaijan</title>

      <description>George-Eduard Grigore, Simona Nicolae, Oana Vl&#259;du&#355;, Proceedings of the ... International Conference on Business Excellence. 18(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400286874

                Abstract The aim of this research is to conduct an objective and predictive evaluation of Azerbaijan's economic growth from 1997 to 2022. Since Azerbaijan is a significant exporter and producer of energy resources, its economic growth is substantially influenced by the remarkable advancements in oil and gas extraction and production since the early 2000s. Methodologically, we have designed several models to ascertain the influence and impact of the following explanatory factors-oil reserves, natural gas reserves, net trade, current account balance, inflation rate, unemployment rate, interest rate and carbon dioxide emissions - on the economic growth rate. The study utilised a combination of uni- and multi-factorial linear regression techniques, with accuracy and robustness testing conducted on all eight models. Research hypotheses were tested and a predictive analysis was implemented and evaluated over the studied period. Our findings demonstrate that the growth of Azerbaijan's economy is positively impacted by the dynamics and development of energy product trade, particularly in oil. As a result, GDP increased by an average of 2.50%. It is also confirmed that inflation and unemployment have a negative impact which unavoidably leads to instability and an economic downturn. In contrast, the robustness indicators (namely, RMSE, MAE and MAPE) could assess the predictive analysis of economic growth. The validated, low values further endorse the credibility of the eight models in accurately forecasting the economic growth rate throughout the studied period. The study disproves the existence of a positive correlation between GDP and the quantity of carbon dioxide emissions. However, it has been demonstrated that Azerbaijan is taking significant measures to achieve its environmental objectives. These measures include the implementation of taxation, a reduction in CO 2 emissions by up to 55% by 2030, and a shift towards renewable energy sources. Our research aims to enhance the utilisation of renewable energy resources, increase the efficiency of the domestic energy infrastructure and implement measures to moderate high levels of unemployment and inflation, thus ensuring sustained economic growth in Azerbaijan.</description>

      <title>Interannual variability of air-sea CO2 exchange in the Northern Yellow Sea and its underlying mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1412798</link>
      <description>Lu Jia, Hongtao Nie, Jia&#8208;Wei Shen, Hao Wei, Guijie Guo, Haiyan Zhang, Frontiers in marine science. 11(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400200805

                A three-dimensional (3-D) physical-biogeochemical-carbon cycle coupled model is used to investigate the interannual variability of the air-sea carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) flux ( F CO 2 ) in the Northern Yellow Sea (NYS) from 2009 to 2018. The verification of the model indicate that the simulation results for multiple variables exhibit consistency and fit well with the observed data. The study show that although the multi-year average F CO 2 in the NYS is close to the source-sink balance, there are obvious interannual differences between different years. In particular, a relatively strong source of atmospheric CO 2 (1.0 mmol m &#8211;2 d &#8211;1 ) is exhibited in 2014, while a relatively strong sink of atmospheric CO 2 (&#8211;0.7 mmol m &#8211;2 d &#8211;1 ) emerges in 2016. Mechanism analysis indicates that the abnormally high temperature is the main controlling factor for the relatively high CO 2 efflux rate in the NYS in 2014, while the abnormally low dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration is the main factor contributing to the relatively high CO 2 influx rate in 2016. Further analysis reveals that the primary reason for the low DIC concentration since the onset of winter in 2016 is the high net decrease rate of DIC in the NYS in 2015, influenced by net community production in the summer and advection processes during the autumn. The abnormally high primary production during the summer of 2015 results in the excessive reduction of DIC concentration through biological processes. In addition, due to the strong northeasterly wind event in November 2015, low-concentration-DIC water from the Yellow Sea (YS) extends into the Bohai Sea (BS). This further leads to higher DIC flux from the NYS into the BS in the upper mixed layer and increases the inflow of low-concentration-DIC water from the Southern Yellow Sea (SYS) into the NYS. These ultimately result in the abnormal reduction of DIC concentration in the upper mixed layer of the NYS during the autumn of 2015. This study enriches our understanding of interannual variability of F CO 2 in the NYS, which will not only help to further reveal the variations of F CO 2 under human activities and climate change, but also provide useful information for guiding the comprehensive assessment of the carbon budget.</description>

      <title>Computational Design of an Electro-Organocatalyst for Conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into Long Chain Aldehydes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.4c00780</link>
      <description>Foroogh Khezeli, Craig Plaisance, &#152;The &#156;journal of physical chemistry. A/&#152;The &#156;journal of physical chemistry. A.. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400329981

                Density functional theory calculations employing a hybrid implicit/explicit solvation method were used to demonstrate that an electro-organocatalyst designed in our previous work for reducing CO2 to formaldehyde could also be capable of coupling formaldehyde to form long chain aldehydes. The catalytic activity is enabled by an electron-rich vicinal enediamine (&gt;N&#8211;C&#9552;C&#8211;N&lt;) backbone that activates formaldehyde by reversing the polarity on the carbon atom, enabling it to act as a nucleophile in the subsequent aldol addition step. The catalyst then enables reductive dehydroxylation of the aldol addition product by facilitating outer-sphere electron transfer. The optimal pH as well as the limiting potential and formaldehyde concentration are identified and related to the kinetic balance between several rate limiting steps. Finally, the optimal conditions for coupling with the CO2 reduction cycle are discussed, demonstrating that the electro-organocatalyst is capable of efficiently converting CO2 into aldehyde products with a turnover frequency (per carbon atom) on the order of 0.1&#8211;1 s&#8211;1.</description>

      <title>Enhancing sustainability in sewage treatment: A least squares support vector regression-based modeling approach for optimizing regeneration conditions of iFeCu</title>

                Nanoparticles in wastewater treatment offer sustainable, efficient removal of persistent pollutants, with minimal resource usage and reusability. This study examines the reusability of immobilized iron&#8209;copper nanoparticles (iFeCu) for sewage treatment. The effect of the regeneration condition of iFeCu including the regeneration time and temperature on the performance of iFeCu for sewage treatment was investigated. Moreover, a soft sensor model, namely principal component analysis discrimination analysis ensemble least squares support vector regression (PCA-DA-E-LSSVR) model was developed to predict the performance of iFeCu, and an online performance of the model was studied to evaluate its accuracy. Investigating regeneration conditions like time and temperature, it was found that iFeCu regenerated in 1 mol (M) sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) at 40 &#176;C for 5 h performed comparably to that regenerated at 60 &#176;C for 15 h. Higher regeneration temperatures (&gt;40 &#176;C) decreased carbon dioxide and monoxide emissions but reduced ammonia (NH3) removal by &#8764;22 %. Shorter regeneration times (&lt;5 h) decreased Na2CO3-iFeCu interaction, leading to an &#8764;11 % NH3 removal reduction. The correlation coefficient, R2 value of 0.8514 was obtained for the proposed PCA-DA-E-LSSVR model. Overall, the developed model well-fits the nonlinear data in sewage treatment and provides acceptable ranges of online performance results.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evaluation of CO2-Soluble Nonionic Surfactants for Wettability Alteration to Intermediate CO2-Oil Wet during Immiscible Gas Injection</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/221487-pa</link>

                Summary The change in wettability of limestone reservoirs from oil-wet toward gas-wet can enhance crude oil production during immiscible CO2 injection. Therefore, in this research, we investigated the impact of wettability alteration to CO2-wet on oil recovery factor via dissolution of fluorine-free, CO2-philic, nonionic surfactants such as C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19 in CO2. Based on the cloudpoint measurements, the dissolution pressures of nonionic surfactants in supercritical CO2 ranged between 2,100 psi and 2,700 psi (below the reservoir pressure, i.e., 3,000 psi) at reservoir temperature, 65&#176;C; these pressures are commensurate with CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) pressures. Also, the C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19 can reduce the CO2-oil interfacial tension (IFT). Moreover, the CO2/C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19 solutions can change the limestone wettability from strongly oil-wet (&#920; ~ 20o) to intermediate CO2/oil-wet (&#920; = 95o and 110o) at reservoir conditions. The relative permeability curves also confirmed it by changing the curvature to the left and decreasing the residual oil saturation in both cases of CO2/C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19 solutions. The 20.8% and 13.1% additional oil recoveries were achieved during the 30,000 ppm CO2/C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19 solution scenarios, respectively, relative to the pure CO2 injection scenario. These nonionic surfactants are not able to make CO2-in-oil foam; therefore, wettability alteration and perhaps IFT reduction are the dominant mechanisms of EOR induced by the dissolution of nonionic surfactants in CO2, instead of CO2 mobility control. Consequently, the dissolution of fluorine-free, oxygenated, CO2-philic, nonionic surfactants (such as C4(PO)6 and C41H83O19) in CO2 at 30,000 ppm concentration can be a well-qualified candidate for altering the limestone wettability to intermediate CO2-oil-wet during the immiscible CO2 injection.</description>

                Artificial photosynthesis is an effective way of converting CO2 into fuel and high value-added chemicals. However, the sluggish interfacial electron transfer and adsorption of CO2 at the catalyst surface strongly hamper the activity and selectivity of CO2 reduction. Here, we report a photocathode attaching zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) onto a ZnTe surface to mimic an aquatic leaf featuring stoma and chlorophyll for efficient photoelectrochemical conversion of CO2 into CO. ZIF-8 possessing high CO2 adsorption capacity and diffusivity has been selected to enrich CO2 into nanocages and provide a large number of catalytic active sites. ZnTe with high light-absorption capacity serves as a light-absorbing layer. CO2 molecules are collected in large nanocages of ZIF-8 and delivered to the ZnTe surface. As evidenced by scanning electrochemical microscopy, the interface can effectively boost interfacial electron transfer kinetics. The ZIF-8/ZnTe photocathode with unsaturated Zn&#8211;Nx sites exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency for CO production of 92.9% and a large photocurrent of 6.67 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 at &#8722;2.48 V (vs Fc/Fc+) in a nonaqueous electrolyte at AM 1.5G solar irradiation (100 mW&#183;cm&#8211;2).</description>

                In this study, hexadecyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) surfactant-modified copper molybdate (CuMoO4) nanorod material was synthesized for the electrocatalysis of CO2 in a H cell reactor where CMO3 (CuMoO4 with the 0.5 g loading of CTAB surfactant) helped the formation of acetaldehyde with Faradaic efficiency of 41%. The long positive alkyl chain of CTAB directs the growth of copper molybdate nanomaterial in a three-dimensional nanorod shape, and this rodlike structure of copper molybdate provides exposed surface area for the successful electrochemical reduction of CO2. The production of C3 products like n-propanol and iso-propanol was successful due to the tremendous conductive character of the Cu element in CuMoO4. Copper molybdate (CMO3), the smallest particle size among all the compositions, performed extremely well under suitable potential range and facilitates high selectivity (80%) of the formation of acetaldehyde at a potential of &#8722;0.931 V vs RHE upon lowering of the hydrogen evolution reaction. The free energies of the molecule were determined theoretically using the density of states (DOS) of CuMoO4, and density functional study of the CO2 reduction pathway to acetaldehyde was accomplished by considering the free energy of intermediate charge transfer species.</description>

      <title>Individual grain mass of inbred rice cultivars does not benefit from elevated [CO2]</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2024.105888</link>

                Climate warming has led to a reduction of global crop yields. Elevated atmospheric [CO2] is believed to promote crop production by increasing photosynthesis, and thus partly offset the yield losses due to climate warming. However, photosynthetic acclimation may occur when the plant is exposed to long-term high [CO2] conditions, suggesting that elevated [CO2] (e[CO2]) might not bring benefits for cereal crops as the growing season proceeds. To assess the effect of long-term e[CO2] on rice yield, particularly on individual grain mass determined post-heading, we synthesized existing data from FACE (free-air CO2 enrichment) experiments across four locations in Japan and China. We also conducted a five-year field experiment with different [CO2] treatments using OTC (open-top chamber) facility. A novel experiment of pot replacement at heading was conducted in 2018 to evaluate the effect of post-heading e[CO2] on individual grain mass of rice. Meanwhile, we measured net photosynthetic rates under ambient [CO2] (a[CO2]) and e[CO2] (ambient + 200 &#956;mol mol&#8722;1) at different developmental stages to identify the occurrence of photosynthetic acclimation. We show that FACE condition did not increase individual grain mass across thirty-six inbred rice cultivars at various rates of nitrogen application, and that the replacement of potted plants either from a[CO2] to e[CO2] or from e[CO2] to a[CO2] did not impact the individual grain mass. The yield benefit from e[CO2] was primarily attributed to an increase in the spikelet density determined pre-heading. We conclude that the individual grain mass of inbred rice does not benefit from e[CO2], which is most likely attributed to a loss of the advantage in CO2 gain induced by photosynthetic acclimation. Our findings suggest the necessity for selective breeding strategies to make better use of post-heading e[CO2] and for crop modelers to incorporate updated knowledge into models in the context of elevated [CO2].</description>

      <title>Study on methane degradation by microbial agents based on chelating wetting agent carriers</title>

                Abstract Due to the low permeability characteristics of the deep gas-containing coal seam, the conventional prevention and control measures that cannot solve the problems of gas outbursts are unsatisfactory for the prevention and control of the coal and gas outbursts disaster. Therefore, in this study, a strain of methane-oxidizing bacteria M 07 with high-pressure resistance, strong resistance, and high methane degradation rate was selected from coal mines. The growth and degradation abilities of M 07 in chelating wetting agent solutions to assess its adaptability and find the optimal agent-to-M07 ratio. It provides a new method for integrating the reduction of impact tendency and gas pressure in deep coal mines. The experimental results show that M 07 is a Gram-positive bacterium of the genus Bacillus , which has strong resistance and adaptability to high-pressure water injection. By degrading 70 mol of methane, M 07 produces 1 mol of carbon dioxide, which can reduce gas pressure and reduce the risk of gas outbursts in coal mines. As the experiment proves, the best effect was achieved when the M 07 concentration of the chelating wetting agent was 0.05%. The methane-oxidizing bacteria based on the chelating wetting agent as carriers prove a new prevention and control method for the integrated prevention and control of coal and gas outbursts in coal mines and also provide a new idea for microbial application in coal mine disaster control.</description>

                The factors that govern CO2 solubility in ionic liquids (ILs) are of great interest for the development of new materials for CO2 capture and utilization. The cationic functional group (i.e., imidazolium, pyrrolidinium, pyridinium, etc.), alkyl chain length of cation, degree of fluorination of anion, anion size, and the void fraction in IL are known to influence CO2 solubility. However, a comprehensive explanation of how these factors collectively affect CO2 solubility has not been developed yet. This knowledge gap is largely attributed to the lack of CO2 solubility data for IL structures other than imidazolium based ILs. We report here an automated high-throughput (HT) setup for the measurement of CO2 solubility in room-temperature ILs (RTILs) combining six different anions and nine different cations for a total of 19 different specific ranges of RTILs. The HT setup first dispenses up to 200 &#181;L of RTILs in a 96-well microtiter plate and then utilizes a robotic arm to measure cyclic voltammogram (CV) in each well using maneuverable Ag electrodes. The Cottrell analysis of the CO2 reduction CV peak provides a direct measurement of CO2 permeance in RTILs, which yields Henry's constant from the estimated diffusion coefficient of CO2. Henry's constants thus obtained are in very good agreement with those reported earlier. The measured CO2 permeance and Henry's constant of all RTILs seem to follow a first-order dependence on void fraction and a second-order dependence on electrostatic interaction between anion and cation of IL, with some synergistic dependence on the product of a void fraction and electrostatic interaction, making them two important descriptors for the design of novel ILs.</description>

                Incorporating outstanding flame retardancy and electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness (EMI SE) into polymers is a pressing requirement for practical utilization. In this study, we first employed the principles of microencapsulation and electrostatic interaction-driven self-assembly to encapsulate polyethyleneimine (PEI) molecules and Ti3C2Tx nanosheets on the surface of ammonium polyphosphate (APP), forming a double-layer-encapsulated structure of ammonium polyphosphate (APP@PEI@Ti3C2Tx). Subsequently, flame-retardant thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) composites were fabricated by melting the flame-retardant agent with TPU. Afterwards, by using air-assisted thermocompression technology, we combined a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) film with flame-retardant TPU composites to fabricate hierarchical TPU/APP@PEI@Ti3C2Tx/rGO composites. We systematically studied the combustion behavior, flame retardancy, and smoke-suppression performance of these composite materials, as well as the flame-retardant mechanism of the expansion system. The results indicated a significant improvement in the interface interaction between APP@PEI@Ti3C2Tx and the TPU matrix. Compared to pure TPU, the TPU/10APP@PEI@1TC composite exhibited reductions of 84.1%, 43.2%, 62.4%, and 85.2% in peak heat release rate, total heat release, total smoke release, and total carbon dioxide yield, respectively. The averaged EMI SE of hierarchical TPU/5APP@PEI@1TC/rGO also reached 15.53 dB in the X-band.</description>

                The tourism industry often overlooked environmental vulnerability, especially its contribution to climate change, necessitating attention. Hotels, a key tourism sector, significantly impact the environment, emitting substantial carbon dioxide and consuming large amounts of water. The Indonesian Ministry of Tourism emphasizes eco-friendly hotel management through the Green Hotel program. This research, a comprehensive investigation, employs qualitative methods, including documentation review, observation, and interviews with hotel personnel, including the General Manager, Chief Engineer, Business Development Executive, and Housekeeping Manager. The study explores Green Hotel practices at Holiday Inn Jakarta Kemayoran, part of IHG. The data analysis, involving data collection, data reduction, data display, and concluding/verifying data, is robust and thorough. It shows that the effective implementation of Green Engage at the hotel, IHG's sustainability program, is evident in eco-friendly materials, energy efficiency, water conservation, and waste management. These efforts contribute to environmental conservation and reduce costs, emissions, and waste while increasing occupancy rates, reflecting guest preference for green accommodations. This research underscores the positive impact of Green Hotel implementation on both the hotel's performance and environmental conservation, instilling hope for a more sustainable future. Continuous efforts are needed to enhance sustainability practices, embracing more eco-friendly initiatives and involving guests in environmentally conscious actions.</description>

                This study proposes an IoT architecture for monitoring emissions of polluting gases in vehicles, in response to the growing concern about air pollution and global warming. The architecture is based on a node equipped with DHT22, MQ9, and MQ135 sensors to capture temperature, humidity, and gas emissions, respectively. This node effectively communicates through the LTE network to send the data to the ThingSpeak platform. An analysis of CO2, CO, and CH4 pollution levels is conducted using the collected data. These data are validated through the technical review of a test vehicle. Subsequently, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained using a specific database of CO2 emissions from vehicles in Canada. As a result, a high R2 of 99.2% is achieved, along with low values of RMSE and MSE, indicating that the model is making accurate predictions and fits well to the training data. The ANN aims to predict CO2 emissions and verify CO2 data from the IoT network. The architecture demonstrates its capability for real-time monitoring and its potential to contribute to pollution reduction.</description>

      <title>Boosting CO2 electrolysis via synergy between active heterogeneous interface and oxygen defects</title>

                The commercial viability of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO is hampered by the sluggish electrocatalytic activity of the electrode materials. In this study, a series of perovskites, Pr0.5Sr0.5Cr0.1Fe0.9-xNixO3-&#948; (x = 0.1, 0.2, PSCFNx) with different Ni doping levels were synthesized. The results showed that increasing Ni doping led to the creation of more oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, treatment of PSCFNx in a reducing atmosphere resulted in a structural transformation into a composite with a heterogeneous interface between the Ruddlesden-Popper perovskite (RP-PSCFNx) and an exsolved Ni-Fe metal alloy. The re-PSCFN0.2-based cell showed a current density of 2.40 A cm-2 and a Faraday efficiency (FE%) of almost 100% at 850 &#176;C and 1.6 V, an improvement of 18% in comparison to the re-PSCFN0.1-based cell. This study provides a strategy to synergistically improve the electrochemical reduction of CO2 activity of SOECs by constructing an active heterogeneous interface and increasing the oxygen vacancy content.</description>

      <title>A System Dynamics Model for Rooftop Solar PV System Development in Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.47191/ijcsrr/v7-i6-96</link>
      <description>Ari Agustar, Widhyawan Prawiraatmadja, International Journal of Current Science Research and Review. 07(06)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400163823

                Despite of Indonesia&#8217;s vast solar energy potential according to the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Indonesia&#8217;s total installed capacity of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) is very far from Indonesia&#8217;s target of 3.6 GW in 2025. Indonesia once applied net metering scheme for rooftop solar PV policy and was expected to be able to boost rooftop solar PV growth. A system dynamics approach is used in the research to develop an assessment model to evaluate the policies&#8217; impact on residential rooftop solar PV system growth. A Causal Loop Diagram was established then transformed into Stock and Flow Diagram (SFD) using software Vensim PLE 10.1.3, which was used to simulate several policies&#8217; scenarios related to residential rooftop solar PV adoption and CO2 emissions reduction. Ten scenarios were simulated in this study involving three groups of intervention: initial net metering tariff, reduction on initial solar PV cost, upper limit of ROI, and combination of initial net metering tariff and initial solar PV cost reduction. The simulations revealed that combination of increasing net metering tariff to 80% &amp; initial cost reduction 30% has the highest potential solar PV installations, the highest CO2 emissions reduction, and the lowest accumulation cost of net metering in 2030. This study can be used as reference by the policy makers in Indonesia to formulate the optimum policy to boost rooftop solar PV growth as the simulations shows that residential rooftop solar PV with the right intervention can meet the government&#8217;s target of rooftop solar PV in 2030.</description>

                Regulating the binding effect between the surface of an electrode material and reaction intermediates is essential in highly efficient CO2 electro&#8208;reduction to produce high&#8208;value multicarbon (C2+) compounds. Theoretical study reveals that lattice tensile strain in single&#8208;component Cu catalysts can reduce the dipole&#8211;dipole repulsion between *CO intermediates and promotes *OH adsorption, and the high *CO and *OH coverage decreases the energy barrier for C&#8211;C coupling. In this work, Cu catalysts with varying lattice tensile strain were fabricated by electro&#8208;reducing CuO precursors with different crystallinity, without adding any extra components. The as&#8208;prepared single&#8208;component Cu catalysts were used for CO2 electro&#8208;reduction, and it is discovered that the lattice tensile strain in Cu could enhance the Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2+ products effectively. Especially, the as&#8208;prepared CuTPA catalyst with high lattice tensile strain achieves a FEC2+ of 90.9% at &#8722;1.25 V vs. RHE with a partial current density of 486.1 mA cm&#8722;2.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Machinability and Sustainability: The Effects of Hybrid MQL+CO2 Cooling on the Drilling of AA7075T6 with TiO2 and C-Reinforced Composites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/machines12070449</link>

                This study investigates the impact of various auxiliary cooling techniques on machinability, energy consumption, carbon emissions, and economic factors in the drilling process of AA7075T6 aluminium alloy using TiO2 and C-reinforced composites. The study employed various cooling conditions (dry, MQL, CO2, and hybrid MQL+CO2), with different cutting speeds and feed rates, to evaluate their effects on drilling characteristics. The findings indicated that the combined MQL and CO2 cooling notably enhanced the drilling process by reducing cutting forces by 32% and surface roughness by 65% compared to dry cutting. This synergy between lubrication and cooling significantly improves machinability, resulting in higher-quality machining outputs with smoother surfaces and more precise circularity. Energy analysis revealed that the MQL+CO2 method reduces energy consumption to 64% observed under dry conditions, underscoring its efficiency through better heat dissipation and reduced friction. Furthermore, this method demonstrates a significant reduction in carbon emissions, contributing to environmental sustainability. Economically, although initial costs associated with the implementation of cooling systems are higher, they are offset by reduced tool wear and energy costs, making it a viable solution for sustainable manufacturing practices.</description>

      <title>Far-red light effects on plant photosynthesis: from short-term enhancements to long-term effects of artificial solar light</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcae104</link>
      <description>Martina Lazzarin, Killian Dupont, W. van Ieperen, L.F.M. Marcelis, Steven M. Driever, Annals of botany. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400219180

                Abstract Background and Aims Long-term exposure over several days to Far-Red (FR) increases leaf expansion, while short-term exposure (minutes) may enhance the PSII operating efficiency (&#981;PSII). The interaction between these responses at different time scales, and their impact on photosynthesis at whole-plant level is not well understood. Our study aimed to assess the effects of FR in an irradiance mimicking the spectrum of sunlight (referred to as artificial solar irradiance) both in the long and short-term, on whole-plant CO2 assimilation rates and in leaves at different positions in the plant. Methods Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants were grown under artificial solar irradiance conditions with either a severely reduced or normal fraction of FR (SUN(FR-) vs. SUN). To elucidate the interplay between the growth light treatment and the short-term reduction of FR, we investigated this interaction at both the whole-plant and leaf level. At whole-plant level, CO2 assimilation rates were assessed under artificial solar irradiance with a normal and a reduced fraction of FR. At the leaf level, the effects of removal and presence of FR (0FR and 60FR) during transition from high to low light on CO2 assimilation rates and chlorophyll fluorescence were evaluated in upper and lower leaves. Key Results SUN(FR-) plants had lower leaf area, shorter stems, and darker leaves than SUN plants. While reducing FR during growth did not affect whole-plant photosynthesis under high light intensity, it had a negative impact at low light intensity. Short-term FR removal reduced both plant and leaf CO2 assimilation rates, but only at low light intensity and irrespective of the growth light treatment and leaf position. Interestingly, the kinetics of &#981;PSII from high to low light were accelerated by 60FR, with a larger effect in lower leaves of SUN than in SUN(FR-) plants. Conclusions Growing plants with a reduced amount of FR light lowers whole-plant CO2 assimilation rates at low light intensity through reduced leaf area, despite maintaining similar leaf-level CO2 assimilation to leaves grown with a normal amount of FR. The short-term removal of FR brings about significant but marginal reductions in photosynthetic efficiency at the leaf level, regardless of the long-term growth light treatment.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Life Cycle CO2 Emissions for the LDR-50 Nuclear District Heating Reactor</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17133250</link>
      <description>Laura Sokka, Heidi Kirppu, Jaakko Lepp&#228;nen, Energies. 17(13)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400242184

                The LDR-50 low-temperature nuclear reactor is designed for the Finnish and European district heating markets, as an environmentally sustainable heating option for the 2030s. While the carbon footprint of conventional electricity-producing reactors is known to be small, there have been no comprehensive studies on the emission reduction potential when the technology is applied to the heating sector. This paper aims to fill this knowledge gap by means of life cycle assessment (LCA) analysis. The carbon footprint of the LDR-50 heating plant is evaluated, and compared to conventional heating fuels, direct electric heating, and heat pumps. The results of the analysis show that the life cycle CO2 emissions are low, although there are still significant uncertainties related to the construction phase, due to missing data. In addition to carbon footprint, the analysis is also extended to other adverse environmental impacts. It is concluded that significant reductions in CO2 emissions can be achieved by replacing fossil heating fuels with nuclear energy. The technology is considered a viable option alongside biofuels and heat pumps. The overall environmental impacts are low, and the production does not compete for low-carbon electricity or scarce natural resources.</description>

                In the vast majority of studies, methanol production via CO2 hydrogenation is realized using bifunctional catalysts, commonly CuZnO phases. The basic motivation of this study is to confront main concerns regarding typical copper-based catalysts, which are the aggregation of the active metal nanoparticles (NPs) and its concomitant deactivation. For this, an extensive research on composites of mesoporous iron trimesate metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) [crystalline MIL-100(Fe) and semiamorphous FeBTC], loaded with copper clusters (CuCs) into the pores, is performed, because it is a pioneer in the area. The growth and aggregation of CuCs are hindered by the confinement of the active entities into the MOF mesocages. From the two studied MOFs, only the copper loaded semiamorphous FeBTC behaves as a catalyst. To further enhance the catalytic activity, CuCs@FeBTC NPs are dispersed on the plates constituting a reduced graphene-oxide aerogel. Main steps in the preparation of these complex catalysts involve the use of sustainable technology based on supercritical CO2, used either as a solvent or drying agent. The reduction strategy designed to obtain the active catalyst (Cu2+ to Cu+/Cu0 in CuCs) was crucial to upgrade the end product performance. A double reduction route, applying ascorbic acid preceding thermal H2 reduction, turns out to be necessary to attain a significant catalytic activity of the confined Cu2+ species. The as-synthesized and spent catalysts were analyzed in regard of the structure (X-ray diffraction, infrared), bulk (mass spectrometry) and surface (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) composition, morphology (microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy) and textural properties (N2 physisorption). The catalytic performance of reduced CuCs@FeBTC and [CuCs@FeBTC]@rGO composites was tested in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction at 10 bar. Methane and methanol were obtained as valuable reaction products. When using the [CuCs@FeBTC]@rGO aerogel, methanol yield was noticeably high, in comparison to reported data, in the order of 86 mgMeOHgCu&#8211;1 h&#8211;1; while the amount of side products (methane, CO) was almost totally hindered up to 260 &#176;C.</description>

                The consumption of digital content is essential for economic and scientific development, leading to a high dependence on information and communication technologies, which significantly impacts the environment. Quantifying this ecological impact is challenging due to its intangible nature and the diversity of factors. This research focuses on assessing the energy consumption and CO2 production of Spanish university websites to evaluate their levels of digital pollution and environmental impact. The calculation of the carbon footprint considers factors related to energy consumption and the use of green or renewable energies. The findings indicate that only 17% of university websites can be considered environmentally friendly. There are significant differences in CO2 consumption and emissions depending on whether the websites implement environmentally sound practices. This study highlights the lack of initiatives aimed at reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with web information management. The study shows that Spanish universities have the potential to contribute to the reduction in CO2 emissions by implementing sustainable development practices on their websites. Furthermore, it fosters awareness about technology usage and its environmental impact, promoting the adoption of green and sustainable approaches.</description>

      <title>Study Examines Limitations of CCS and Their Effect on Oil and Gas Production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/0724-0102-jpt</link>

                _ This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper SPE 214950, &#8220;Limitations and Fallacies of Carbon Capture and Storage and Impact on Oil and Gas Production,&#8221; by S.M. Farouq Ali, SPE, and Mohamed Y. Soliman, SPE, University of Houston. The paper has not been peer reviewed. _ In the complete paper, the authors write that, while carbon capture and storage (CCS) initiatives are affecting oil and gas operations profoundly, such efforts have had little perceptible effect on atmospheric CO2, which continues to increase. The paper aims to show that current CCS regimens have serious technical and fiscal constraints and questionable validity, stating that, globally, CCS has not increased beyond approximately 0.1% of global CO2 emissions in the past 20 years. The paper offers partial solutions and concludes that, while oil and gas will continue to be important energy sources beyond the foreseeable future, oil companies will accomplish the needed CCS. Introduction The authors write that, while CCS efforts have been pursued for 4 decades, little has been achieved. For the past 20 years, the percentage of CO2 captured and stored is less than 0.1% of the CO2 emitted worldwide, if one considers CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects to be CSS&#8212;which, the authors write, is a fallacy. They emphasize that CCS means injection with no production. The key to CCS success, they write, is major governmental subsidization, by whatever terminology it is known, and that means taxpayer money. Sweeping decisions that have a profound effect on oil and gas production and petroleum engineering education are being made based on predictions of an increase in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere in various time frames. Magnitude of the Problem The problem of world CO2 emissions capture is gigantic. To appreciate the magnitude of the problem, imagine that 1 year&#8217;s CO2 emissions (40 billion tonnes) are captured, compressed and liquified, and injected into a reservoir the size of the Ghawar oil field, the largest reservoir in the world, with the entire pore space (approximately 0.5 Tcf) available for storage. In this hypothetical, nine such reservoirs would be required every year. Presumably, such storage space can be found, but collecting the CO2 and bringing it to a storage site is a highly complex task. For example, in a sequestration effort in a building complex in New York, the CO2 is separated, liquified, and trucked to a storage site to be injected underground, which is impractical. Often, the example of the Nordic countries (mainly Denmark, Sweden, and Norway) is cited as evidence of successful emissions reduction. But the total population of these countries is approximately the same as that of metropolitan Mumbai in India. Definitions Carbon capture use and storage (CCUS) implies that the CO2 produced by various processes is captured and used for EOR. This accounts for approximately 30% of the 230 mtpa of CO2 captured globally. CCS means that any CO2 produced by the process is captured and injected into a suitable geological formation for storage for thousands of years. Net-zero emissions (NZE) implies that all the CO2 produced is captured and stored. In Canada, &#8220;absolute zero emissions&#8221; is discussed, meaning that no CO2 is produced in the first place, pointing to total fossil-fuel phaseout.</description>

                Abstract The ability of high-temperature solid oxide cell (SOC) electrochemical reactors to efficiently convert atmospheric carbon to high value chemicals for industrial and energy storage applications via CO2 and co-electrolysis makes them a key technology for active carbon utilisation. However, due to additional operational risks from thermochemical reactions on thermal management, limited experimental capacity, and relative novelty, CO2 and co-electrolysis lag behind steam electrolysis in large-scale adoption. Here, a 1D+1D SOC model based on fundamental first principles considering three-dimensional heat transfer was improved via a unique method for representing co-electrolysis electrochemistry, solving with low computational effort. Validation against experimental data for two compositions and pressures, showed high levels of accuracy with respect to characteristic cell voltages, temperatures, and outlet compositions. The model also showed CO2 reduction during co-electrolysis mainly occurred via reverse water gas shift, while CO2 electrolysis still accounted for up to 35% of the total share. Pressurised co-electrolysis operation promotes exothermic methanation, causing pronounced heating of the reactor, consequently reducing the isothermal current density. Therefore, low to moderate pressurisation is likely most suited for coupling with downstream synthesis processes to avoid the installation of unnecessarily large systems and associated high costs.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Ionization Equilibrium-Induced &#8220;Oxygen Exchange&#8221; in CO Electroreduction</title>

                The oxygen source of oxygenates is the fundamental issue for CO2/CO electroreduction, which was firmly believed to originate from the gas feed (Ogas) for a long time. However, recent experiments have confirmed that most O atoms of the generated alcohols via CO reduction arise from the solvent (Oaq), indicating the existence of a rather mysterious "oxygen exchange" process. In this work, we solved this mechanistic puzzle using comprehensive computations. Our results revealed that high CO pressure enables COgas oxidation by surface *OaqH, which opens a pathway for oxygenate production. The generated *COgasOaqH can react with another *CO to form *COCOgasOaqH, which leads to the formation of a series of carboxyl-containing intermediates (RCOgasOaqH) in subsequent steps. Due to the dynamic ionization equilibrium, H+ moves rapidly between Ogas and Oaq via reversible "inner" proton transfer (*RCOgasOaqH &#8652; *R-COgasOaq&#8211; + H+ &#8652; *RCOaqOgasH). The oxygen exchange completes when *RCOaq forms via the dehydroxylation of a certain *RCOaqOgasH. The completed reaction pathways were further explored by using COgas reduction into C2H5OaqH as an example, which explains related experiments. Therefore, these results refresh the insights into CO2/CO electroreduction and give specific guidelines for the optimization of catalytic performance.</description>

      <title>Influence of the bis&#8208;carbene ligand on manganese catalysts for CO2 electroreduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202401007</link>

                First row transition metal complexes have attracted attention as abundant and affordable electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Manganese complexes bearing bis-N-heterocyclic carbene ligands defining 6-membered ring metallacycles have proven to reduce CO2 to CO selectively at very high rates. Herein, we report the synthesis of manganese carbonyl complexes supported by a rigid ortho-phenylene bridged bis-N-heterocyclic carbene ligand (orthophenylene-bis(N-methylimidazol-2-ylidene, Ph-bis-mim), which defines a 7-membered ring metallacycle. We performed a comparative study with the analogues bearing an ethylene-bis(Nmethylimidazol-2-ylidene ligand (C2H4-bis-mim) and a methylenebis(N-methylimidazol-2-ylidene ligand (CH2-bis-mim) and found that catalysts comprising a seven-membered metallacycle retain similar selectivity and high activity as those with six-membered metallacycles, while reducing the overpotential by 120-190 mV. This study reveals general design principles for manganese bis-N-heterocyclic carbene electrocatalysts which can guide further designs of affordable, fast and low overpotential catalysts for CO2 electroreduction.</description>

      <title>Transition Metal Chelation Effect in MOF-253 Materials: Guest Molecule Adsorption Dynamics and Proposed Formic Acid Synthesis Investigated by Atomistic Simulations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29133211</link>

                The dynamic characterization of guest molecules in the metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can always provide the insightful and inspiring information to facilitate the synthetic design of MOF materials from the bottom-up design of perspective. Herein, we present a series of atomistic molecular dynamics simulation for investigating the bipyridine dicarboxylate (bpydc) linker rotation effect on guest molecule adsorption with and without considering the transition metal (TM) chelation in MOF-253 materials. The simulated PXRD patterns of the various linker orientations present the challenge of distinguishing these structural varieties by the conventional crystalline spectroscopic measurements. The observed short inter-TM stable structure may subsequently lead to the formation of a binuclear TM catalytic site, and a proposed formic acid generation mechanism from CO2 and H2 is derived based upon the density functional theory calculations for the application of CO2 reduction.</description>

      <title>Fractional CO2 Laser vs. Microneedling with PRP in Striae Distensae Treatment: A Comparative Analysis on Asian Skin</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.55489/njmr.140320241000</link>
      <description>Anshula Tayal, Praveen Kumar Rathor, National Journal of Medical Research. 14(03)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400187683

                Background: Stretch marks, or striae distensae (SD), are a common dermatological issue caused by skin stretching and subsequent dermal damage. Various treatments, including laser therapy and microneedling, have been explored for SD. This study evaluates and compares the effectiveness of Fractional CO2 laser and microneedling with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for treating SD. Method: A randomized controlled trial was conducted over a year at Rohilkhand Medical College and Hospital. Ninety-eight patients aged 18-40 were enrolled and divided into two groups: Group A (Fractional CO2 laser) and Group B (microneedling with PRP), each receiving four sessions at three-week intervals. Patients' histories, including demographics and striae characteristics, were documented. The effectiveness of treatments was assessed using the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and Patient Satisfaction Scale (PSS) at multiple follow-ups. Side effects were also recorded. Result: Group A (Fractional CO2 laser) had 49 patients with a mean age of 25.9 years, and Group B (microneedling with PRP) had 49 patients with a mean age of 26.4 years. Group A showed a significant reduction in striae width and length compared to Group B. By Week 12, 48.80% of Group A reported Excellent Improvement in VAS scores, compared to 12.80% in Group B. Patient satisfaction was significantly higher in Group A, with more patients reporting Very Satisfied and Extremely Satisfied outcomes. Side effects such as erythema and hyperpigmentation were more common in Group A. Conclusion: Fractional CO2 laser therapy is more effective than micro needling with PRP in reducing the appearance of stretch marks, with higher patient satisfaction and significant improvements in VAS scores. Despite a higher incidence of side effects, the CO2 laser provides better overall outcomes.</description>

                Waste-to-energy systems can provide a functional demonstration of the economic and environmental benefits of circularity, innovation, and reimagining existing systems. This study offers a robust quantification of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction potential of the adoption of anaerobic digestion (AD) technology on applicable large-scale dairy farms in the contiguous United States. GHG reduction estimates were developed through a robust life cycle modeling framework paired with sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Twenty dairy configurations were modeled to capture important differences in housing and manure management practices, applicable AD technologies, regional climates, storage cleanout schedules, and methods of land application. Monte Carlo results for the 90% confidence interval illustrate the potential for AD adoption to reduce GHG emissions from the large-scale dairy industry by 2.45&#8211;3.52 MMT of CO2-eq per year considering biogas use only in renewable natural gas programs and as much as 4.53&#8211;6.46 MMT of CO2-eq per year with combined heat and power as an additional biogas use case. At the farm level, AD technology may reduce GHG emissions from manure management systems by 58.1&#8211;79.8% depending on the region. Discussion focuses on regional differences in GHG emissions from manure management strategies and the challenges and opportunities surrounding AD adoption.</description>

                Electrochemical reduction of CO2 over wood-derived metal-free N-doped carbon electrocatalysts provides a new route for converting CO2 into value-added fuels However, it is a challenge to efficiently design and screen high-performance electrocatalysts. In this paper, we combined the Marcus equation with the theory of thermal-kinetic correlation to successfully predict the optimal N-C doping ratio. Poplar wood -derived 3D N-doped graphitized carbon with optimal N doping content (pyridine-N 1.87 At%, pyrrole-N, 1.52 At%), high specific surface area (471.2 m2 g-1), and abundant nanopores were successfully obtained with the assistance of melamine (N source), which exhibited a high ECR activity of 86.78% at a low applied potential of -0.71 V (vs. RHE) and long-term stability of at least 10 cycles. This extends the application of the Marcus equation and improves new ideas for the future design of high-performance electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Promoting Effect of Pd Nanoparticles on SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 in the Reverse Water&#8208;Gas Shift Reaction via the Mars&#8211;van Krevelen Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202400871</link>
      <description>Minori Kobayashi, Shimpei Naniwa, Keita Goto, Hideo Matsuo, Shoji Iguchi, Tsunehiro Tanaka, Kentaro Teramura, ChemCatChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400340074

                The reverse water&#8208;gas shift (RWGS) reaction serves as a critical pathway for converting CO2 into diverse chemicals. The Mars&#8211;van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, which leverages lattice oxygen as the oxidant and oxygen vacancies as reductants, offers an alternative catalytic strategy for the selective RWGS reaction. While Mn&#8208;substituted SrTiO3 (i.e., SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3) has been shown to promote the RWGS reaction selectively via the MvK mechanism, achieving a sufficient conversion of CO2 necessitates elevated temperatures. This study investigated the effect of Pd&#8208;loaded SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 on the activation of adsorbed H2 molecules, which generated oxygen vacancies and enhanced CO2 conversion. Notably, 1.0 wt% Pd&#8208;loaded SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 yielded 13.4% of CO at 673 K, whereas pristine SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 and Pd&#8208;loaded SrTiO3 yielded negligible or minimal amount of CO. Hydrogen temperature&#8208;programmed reduction and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements revealed that Pd promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies via both thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and kinetic studies revealed that the RWGS reaction over Pd&#8208;loaded SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 proceeded primarily via the MvK mechanism with a partial contribution from the Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood mechanism. This study underscores the effectiveness of combining metal and MvK&#8208;type catalysts to enhance the efficiency of the RWGS reaction.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the impact of the circular economy concept on economic development</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5937/odrraz2401007j</link>
      <description>Gordan Jankovi&#263;, Milo&#353; Golubovi&#263;, Odr&#382;ivi razvoj. 6(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400353478

                Unlike the linear model of economic development, which is based on taking resources from nature, turning them into a finished product and using that product as the final stage of the life cycle of resources, without taking into account the degree of pollution they cause, there is a so-called circular model. The circular model of the economy is an alternative to the linear model. This means that with the circular model, the use of the finished product does not represent the last phase of the life cycle of the resource, but that used product, through the application of various processes, serves as a resource in further production. The main goal of the circular economic model is to reduce waste and pollution, but also to increase the productivity of resources. Longer use of products, machines, and other fixed assets results in higher productivity of the resources that make up their basic input. One of the main goals of the circular economy is the elimination or at least reduction of pollution, and one of the biggest pollutants is the excessive emission of carbon dioxide, whose chemical formula is &#12310;CO&#12311;2. For this reason, the authors of this research recognized this area as crucial for further economic development. By applying various processes and procedures in developed countries, there was a decrease in the amount of &#12310;CO&#12311;2emissions, while at the same time there was no decrease in economic activities and production in the economies of those countries, but quite the opposite, at the same time there was an increase in the gross national product (GDP). Serbia should use these countries as an example and, using the good practice of developed countries, start as soon as possible with a more extensive transition from a linear to a circular model of economic development, i.e. bring a series of measures, procedures, laws as soon as possible in order to reduce the emission of &#12310;CO&#12311;2. In accordance with this, the logical conclusion would be that the scientific goal of this research work is to identify the role of reducing &#12310;CO&#12311;2 emissions as an important potential for the transition from a linear to a circular model of economic development, without jeopardizing the level of real GDP.</description>

      <title>Enhancing insights into the phenomena of deep eutectic solvents</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.susmat.2024.e01039</link>
      <description>David S. Freitas, Artur Cavaco&#8208;Paulo, Carla Silva, Sustainable materials and technologies. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400336788

                Environmental concerns have spurred a quest for more sustainable and safer solvents, aiming to replace aggressive and harmful chemical products in industrial processes. In response to this need, deep eutectic solvents (DES) have emerged as a progressive evolution from ionic liquids. These innovative solvents result from the synergistic combination of two or more chemical compounds, exhibiting a significant reduction in melting point when blended in specific molar fractions, ultimately achieving a liquid state at room temperature. In recent years, a natural variant known as Natural Deep Eutectic Solvents (NADES) has gained prominence. This environmentally friendly alternative is derived by skilfully combining compounds such as sugars, amino acids, or organic acids, presenting a promising avenue for sustainable and eco-friendly chemical processes. These "green" solvents go beyond applications in chemical or materials engineering, finding application in diverse fields such as biocatalysis, extraction processes, and carbon dioxide capture, among others. Despite their numerous advantages, including low cost, ease of preparation, tuneable properties, and biorenewability, the full potential of DES remains elusive due to insufficient understanding, hindering their seamless integration into industrial applications. While previous reviews have predominantly focused on defining and showcasing the applications of DES, they often overlook the crucial aspect of physicochemical characterization. Similar to other solvent classes, the physicochemical properties of DES such as polarity, viscosity, density, and conductivity play a pivotal role in determining their applicability. Recognizing this gap, the primary objective of this review is to provide a practical guide encompassing the preparation, characterization, and application of DES, thereby facilitating a comprehensive understanding of these solvents for both researchers and practitioners alike. Moreover, the manuscript will delve into the diverse types of DES, exploring their unique physicochemical properties and potential modifications tailored for various applications across different fields.</description>

                Decrease in permeability, porosity, change in wettability of oil-bearing formations during field development are defined by a general term - formation damage, which occur at various stages of field development, including drilling, production, application of enhanced oil recovery methods, well stimulation technologies with acid compositions, hydraulic fracturing and well workover. Reservoir damage leads to a reduction in the oil and gas content of reservoirs and in the economic efficiency of operation. In this regard, it is important to understand and prevent formation damage based on experimental and analytical methods, the applicationof which will minimize damage to the oil and gas bearing reservoir. The review considers anthropogenic processes that cause damage to oil and gas reservoir when CO2 is injected by various methods to enhance oil recovery. The processes of interaction of CO2 with formation rock are considered in detail.

                A long period of deposit development leads to a reduction in the volume of balance reserves of ores, while the volume of accumulation of waste (tailings) from mining and processing production increases. In connection with this, an urgent problem is the processing of waste tailings, which can serve as an additional source of commercial products of non-ferrous metals. The set objectives can be achieved by implementing comprehensive extraction of valuable components, reducing fuel, and energy costs at the stage of low-temperature sintering to produce white soot (grade BS-100). In order to determine the amount of heat of chemical reactions during sintering of rough copper concentrate with sodium hydroxide, thermochemical calculations were carried out. For the research, we used rough copper concentrate with a copper content of 4.40% and silver of 77.03 g/t. An equation has been obtained for calculating the heat of chemical reactions of rough concentrate sintering. According to this equation, the greatest contribution to the heat release is provided by the iron content (60%), three times less and equally (19%) - copper and silicon and about 0.2% is absorbed by aluminum. The thermal effect of sintering will be -920.45 kW&#183;h/t of concentrate. From the heat balance of sintering it follows that with an alkali consumption of up to 200% of the mass of the concentrate. The heat of chemical reactions will be sufficient for the autogeneity of the process. Research has been carried out on sintering the concentrate with alkali in the temperature range of 250-500 &#176;C and obtaining white soot from a productive leaching solution with the extraction of 60% silicon. White soot (mSiO2&#183;nH2O) was isolated by two-stage carbonization of a silicate solution with carbon dioxide in a recirculation system with further washing of the precipitate with a solution of sulfuric acid.

      <title>Oxygen Species Involved in Complete Oxidation of CH4 by SrFeO3-&#948; in Chemical Looping Reforming of Methane</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17133212</link>

                Compared with conventional methane reforming technologies, chemical looping reforming (CLR) has the advantages of self-elimination of coke, a suitable syngas ratio for certain down-stream processes, and a pure H2 or CO stream. In the reduction step of CLR, methane combustion has to be inhibited, which could be achieved by designing appropriate oxygen carriers and/or optimizing the operating conditions. To gain a further understanding of the combustion reaction, methane oxidation by perovskite (SrFeO3-&#948;) at 900 &#176;C and 1 atm in a pulse mode was investigated in this work. The oxygen non-stoichiometry of SrFeO3-&#948; prepared by a Pechini-type polymerizable complex method is 0.14 at ambient conditions, and it increases to 0.25 and subsequently to 0.5 when heating from 100 to 900 &#176;C in argon that contains 2 ppmv of molecular oxygen. The activation energies of the first and second transitions are 294 and 177 kJ/mol, respectively. The presence of 0.99 vol.% hydrogen in argon significantly reduces the amount CO2 produced. At a pulse interval of 10 min, the amount of CO2 produced in the absence of hydrogen is one order of magnitude greater than that in the presence of hydrogen. In the former case, the amount of CO2 produced dramatically decreases first and then gradually approaches a constant, and the oxygen species involved in methane combustion can be partially replenished by extending the pulse interval, e.g., 82.5% of this type of oxygen species is replenished when the pulse interval is extended to 60 min. The restored species predominantly originate from those that reside in the surface layer or even in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Exploring the potential of a novel passenger transport model to study the decarbonisation of the transport sector</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2024.132313</link>

                To explore sustainability strategies in the transport sector in a holistic way, a model dedicated to passenger transportation has been created as a part of the multiregional WILIAM model (Within Limits Integrated Assessment Model). Based on system dynamics, our model increases the diversity of existing passenger transport models within Integrated Assessments Models by offering a detailed representation of the dynamics of the transition for different technologies and transport modes combining technological and behavioural changes. It calculates the energy demand, direct emissions and additional material requirements of the transport sector and can be linked to other submodules of WILIAM to study different feedback loops. Here we report the validation of the offline model and illustrate its usefulness and practical applicability. First, a Baseline transport scenario for Spain was developed and parametrized. This scenario describes the plausible evolution of the Spanish passenger transport system in the absence of ambitious environmental policies but nevertheless achieves a reduction of total direct CO2 emissions from passenger transport from 66 Mt CO2/year in 2022 to 60 Mt CO2/year in 2035, after which emissions remain constant until 2050. Subsequently, following the Avoid-shift-improve approach, various behavioural change measures and technological improvements were introduced. The comparison of the different modelled measures reveals that the most effective tested strategy to reduce direct emissions is the transition to battery electric power trains for cars, buses, and motorcycles, however at the cost of the highest material requirements. Further work will be dedicated to the study of the implications of the link of this submodule with the rest of WILIAM.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Rate of Reduction of Greenhouse Gases from Diesel Engine Powered with Jatropha Curcas Seed Oil Blend Diesel</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.37745/ijeer.13/vol12n13545</link>

                As part of the effort to reduce greenhouse gases emissions and lower its negative effects on climate change, this study was conceived with the aim of evaluating the rate of reduction of greenhouse gases emission from diesel engine powered with Jatropha Curcas seed oil blend diesel. The study produced biodiesel from the oil extracted from the Jatrophha Curcas seed using trans-esterification method. The amount of CO2, SO2 and NO2 emitted from a diesel engine powered with conventional oil and jatropha biodiesel blend were determined to ascertain whether there was reduction or increment in percentage of emissions. Laboratory analysis of Jatropha Curcas oil shows that 131.9524g jatropha curcas seed yielded 90.559ml of biodiesel and 41.2437ml of glycerol. Conventional diesel and Jatropha curcas biodiesel produced has similar physiochemical characteristics confirmed through ASTM(US) and DIN(EN) hence their combustibility. CO2 emissions increased with increase in diesel at B100 and B50 while it decreases in B20 and B40. While NO2 emissions increased by 1% in all the revolutions per minute, SO2 was only detected at B100 and B50 emission of the greenhouse gases. From the questionnaire survey conducted at Egbema, it was found that gas flaring has serious adverse effect on vegetation in the area, significant negative effect on the economy of the area due to the rise in air pollution. The result of the laboratory experiments showed that blended green diesel reduces the emission of greenhouse gases from combustion of diesel. The study recommended adoption of renewable energy sources for the operation of the oil firms in Egbema the study therefore concluded that blended green diesel is a promising alternative fuel for internal combustion engines.</description>

      <title>The Southern Ocean as the climate's freight train &#8211; driving ongoing global warming under zero-emission scenarios with ACCESS-ESM1.5</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-3053-2024</link>
      <description>Matthew A. Chamberlain, Tilo Ziehn, R. M. Law, Biogeosciences. 21(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400209468

                Abstract. Earth system model experiments presented here explore how the centennial response in the Southern Ocean can drive ongoing global warming even with zero CO2 emissions and declining atmospheric CO2 concentrations. These projections were simulated by the earth system model version of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS-ESM1.5) and motivated by the Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP); ACCESS-ESM1.5 simulated ongoing warming in the ZECMIP experiment that switched or branched to zero emissions after 2000 PgC had been emitted. New experiments presented here each simulated 300 years and included intermediate branch points. In each experiment that branched after emitting more than 1000 PgC, the global climate continues to warm. For the experiment that branched after 2000 PgC, or after 3.5 &#176;C of warming from a preindustrial climate, there is 0.37 &#177; 0.08 &#176;C of extra warming after 50 years of zero emissions, which increases to 0.83 &#177; 0.08 &#176;C after 200 years. All branches show ongoing Southern Ocean warming. The circulation of the Southern Ocean is modified early in the warming climate, which contributes to changes in the distribution of both physical and biogeochemical subsurface ocean tracers, such as ongoing warming at intermediate depths and a reduction in deep oxygen south of 60&#176; S. A simple slab model emulates the global temperatures of the ACCESS-ESM1.5 experiments demonstrating the response here is primarily due to the slow response of the ocean and the Southern Ocean in particular. Centennial global warming persists when the slab model is forced with CO2 diagnosed from late-branching experiments with other ZECMIP models, confirming the dominant role of ocean physics at these timescales. However, decadal responses changed due to the larger drawdown of CO2 from other models. Slow ongoing warming in the Southern Ocean can be found in ZEC scenarios of most models, though the amplitude and global influence varies.</description>

                Portland cement concrete is the most consumed material in buildings and infrastructure. The use of portland cement is not limited to building constructions, it is also used as a repairing material. The production of portland cement has a noticeable economic and environmental effects. The paper addresses the economic and environmental benefits of using calcined clay as supplementary cementitious material with high partial replacement of portland cement. The economic benefits include the initial costs and the maintenance cost, which is achieved by enhancing the concrete durability. The cost of calcined clay is strongly affected by the transportation expenses and the availability of local sources. The environmental benefits include the reduction of the CO2 footprint caused by portland cement production.</description>

      <title>Comparative life cycle assessment of organic industrial solid waste co-disposal in a MSW incineration plant</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2024.132322</link>
      <description>Kun Wang, Aijun Li, Guangzhao Guo, Junwei Zhang, Yong&#8208;Xiang Ren, Lu Dong, Lifang Gong, Hongyun Hu, Hong Yao, Ichiro Naruse, Energy. 305(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400377882

                Co-disposal experiments involving industrial solid waste (ISW) are conducted at a municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration plant in this study, investing the environmental impact of co-disposal with different ISW addition proportions using life cycle assessment (LCA). Results show that increasing ISW proportions improves economic indicators, reducing the payback period from 7.92 years (0 % ISW) to 6.58 years (40 % ISW). Environmental impact indicators initially decrease and then increase. The indicator with the greatest environmental impact is Eutrophication Potential (EP), the only major indicator with positive values in all scenarios when considering power output. Its normalization value reaches a minimum at 30 % ISW blending, at 7.85 &#215; 10&#8722;12. Contribution analysis reveals that the direct emissions of N-containing gases are the primary cause, while the addition of urea, ammonia water, and quicklime in flue gas treatment, as well as the ash-slag landfill, also have significant effects. Technical optimization of stepwise co-disposal, denitrification system and ash-slag reduction will be the focus. Compared to the existing conventional situation, the co-disposal system exhibits considerable improvements in environmental benefits and carbon reduction potential. Notably, there is a significant reduction in non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions. This study offers theoretical insights for multi-source waste disposal in MSW incineration plants.</description>

      <title>The Carbon Conundrum: Exploring CO2 Emissions, Public Debt, and Environmental Policy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.28991/esj-2024-08-03-08</link>
      <description>Mohd Shahidan Shaari, Amri Sulong, Abdul Rahim Ridzuan, Miguel Angel Esquivias, Evan Lau, Emerging science journal. 8(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400291788

                This study addresses a critical gap in the literature by examining the impact of CO2emissions on public debt in Malaysia, employing a non-linear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach spanning from 1980 to 2020. This methodology captures the non-linear relationship between CO2 emissions and public debt, providing nuanced insights into how environmental factors shape fiscal dynamics. Despite encountering challenges arising from the limited body of literature on this specific relationship, the study highlights key findings with profound implications for policymakers. The inverse correlation between trade openness and public debt underscores the influence of international trade on Malaysia's fiscal landscape, while a positive association between investment and public debt emphasizes the importance of prudent debt management for economic growth. Furthermore, the negative relationship between higher foreign direct investment and long-term public debt highlights the need to foster an investor-friendly environment. A pivotal contribution is the confirmation of a positive link between CO2 emissions and public debt, urging policymakers to prioritize emission reduction strategies, implement carbon pricing, and promote green technologies. This research offers a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between CO2emissions and public debt, providing valuable insights for informed policy decisions in the Malaysian context.

      <title>Atmospheric compositional variations due to changes in mantle redox state&amp;amp;#160;</title>

                Rocky exoplanets' internal constitution is inferred indirectly through their atmospheric composition. Confidence in this inference necessitates coupling interior and atmospheric models. In the past, various atmospheric redistribution models were developed to determine the composition of exoplanetary atmospheres by varying element abundance, temperature and pressure (Woitke et al., 2021).However, these models neglect that present-day atmospheres were formed via volcanic degassing and, consequently, element abundances are limited by thermodynamic processes accompanying magma ascent and volatile release. Here we combine volcanic outgassing with an atmospheric chemistry model to simulate the evolution of C-H-O-N-S atmospheres in thermal equilibrium below 600 K. These volatiles can be stored in significant amounts in basaltic magmas and are the most commonly degassed species.Our model calculates possible atmospheric compositions by varying oxygen fugacity, melt and surface temperature, and volatile abundances, considering phase solubility, atmospheric processes (e.g., water condensation, hydrogen escape), the change in redox conditions caused by volcanic activity and the influence of existing atmospheres on further degassing.Our findings indicate that the prevailing atmospheric type below 600 K typically consists of CO2, N2, CH4, and, depending on temperature, H2O. Moreover, we illustrate that evolving atmospheric pressure and composition hinge significantly on the oxygen fugacity of the melt due to its impact on gas speciation and solubility. Reduced conditions yield atmospheres dominated by H2, NH3, CH4, and H2O, with exceedingly low atmospheric pressures. In contrast, oxidized conditions result in atmospheres comprising H2O, CO2, N2, and limited CH4, accompanied by high atmospheric pressures. Sulfur gases emerge predominantly at higher surface temperatures, manifesting as S2 or H2S under low mantle redox states and as SO2 under high mantle redox states. Notably, O2 is not generated abiotically, as sufficient carbon or hydrogen remains available to form H2O, CO, or CO2. Therefore, the formation of O2-dominated atmospheres would require excessive photodissociation of H2O or CO2 (Chang et al., 2021), a phenomenon likely common on planets orbiting M-dwarf stars.In addition to highlighting the indirect inference of rocky exoplanets' internal constitution through their atmospheric composition, we demonstrate that reduced magmas can oxidize via H2 and CO degassing, whereas oxidized magmas may undergo reduction through SO2 degassing. Furthermore, we conclude that the depth of the magma source region and the planetary size significantly influence atmospheric compositions due to the varying pressure dependence of degassed species' solubilities.</description>

      <title>Comments: Pore Space Leasing: Insights From a Bakken Surface Owner&#8217;s Perspective</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/0724-0008-jpt</link>
      <description>Pam Boschee, Journal of petroleum technology. 76(07)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400193771

                During a trip to western North Dakota last month to visit my family, I met with a long-time friend, Dick, who holds subsurface mineral rights and surface rights in the Bakken area. Over coffee, German sausage, and kuchen, our conversation naturally turned to the leasing of pore space. Dick has lately been approached by landmen with what they describe as &#8220;great deals&#8221; for purchasing the underlying pore space associated with his surface rights. They hesitate to provide specific offers. Instead, he described the initial interactions as &#8220;like making a deal for a new car or tractor.&#8221; The landmen reply, &#8220;I&#8217;ll need to go back to the client [my boss or manager] with your questions.&#8221; Sound familiar? Like most US states, pore space ownership correlates with surface ownership in North Dakota. In August 2022, the North Dakota Supreme Court clarified the rights of surface owners and the need for compensation for pore space use. It also created uncertainty for oil and gas operators who previously had more latitude in using pore space without compensation. Dick knows his way around the dealmaking involved in oil and gas rights leasing, having been involved in many landmen inquiries in the days of the Bakken boom and subsequent wheeling and dealing. However, pore space leasing is relatively nascent and faces similar unknowns like the early days of Bakken pitches. During his research, he came up against the same walls I have over the years while writing about pore space leasing for carbon sequestration. Becoming more apparent as deals gain momentum is the lack of specifics for comparable deals. As when purchasing a home, identifying &#8220;comps&#8221; for similar properties is a necessary part of the process. But the amounts paid for pore space are closely held, generally not publicly available. It&#8217;s impossible to determine if a deal is good or bad. Is the compensation fair? And individual surface owners and landowners rights associations (and/or their attorneys) are aware of the 45Q tax credit of $85/tonne of CO2 captured and stored available to the project developer/operator under the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act. How should this be factored into the determination of fair compensation? For example, the Ohio River Valley Institute (ORVI), a think tank focused on the Appalachian region, in March described a proposal by Tenaska Inc. to lease underground pore space across seven counties (approximately 80,000 acres) in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia for the sequestering of 150 million tons of CO2. In a document proposing terms for the acquisition of nearly 1,400 acres of pore space in county parklands in Washington County, Pennsylvania, Tenaska offered about $4 million for the county&#8217;s 2.6-million-metric-ton share of the CO2 between 2027 and 2056, or about $1.50 per metric ton. The ORVI called the deal &#8220;ridiculous and borderline insulting.&#8221; It supports this declaration by highlighting a comp available from August 2023. Mountaineer GigaSystem LLC offered the state of West Virginia a royalty of $3.35 per metric ton to sequester CO2 on public land in Mason County&#8212;more than two times what Tenaska is offering Washington County. It also made the point that the ultimate cost of capturing and sequestering the CO2 will not be borne by Tenaska or its customers. The 45Q tax credit will provide Tenaska $423 million annually for sequestering 5 million tons of CO2 annually. The region&#8217;s lease revenue will be $7.5 million. To align with the available comp, ORVI said Tenaska&#8217;s offer should at least match Mountaineer&#8217;s $3.35 instead of the proposed $1.50 per metric ton. In the western US, ExxonMobil is seeking to pay the US Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to inject 150 million tons of CO2 over the course of 20 years into 100,000 subsurface acres of pore space on federal lands. The proposed Snowy River CO2 project in Carter County, Montana, is still in the environmental assessment and public comment phase, and the BLM&#8217;s compensation for the use of the land is not yet publicly disclosed or finalized. Our takeaway after finishing the sausage and kuchen? As pore space leasing evolves, landowners like Dick face a complex landscape of uncertain deals and opaque compensation. With legal clarifications and potential tax credits in play, navigating these new frontiers requires keen insight and vigilance to ensure fair and beneficial agreements for all involved.</description>

      <title>The application of zeolite in reducing green house gases in agriculture field</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.61511/jbiogritech.v1i1.2024.674</link>
      <description>Ketut Putra, Yunita Ismail Masjud, No host. 1(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400352026

                Background: The addition of Zeolite 4A affected cumulative greenhouse emissions from rice. Zeolite 4A has been found to adsorb CH4 and CO2, reducing overall emissions. The combination of zeolite and fertilizer administration in one or two applications provided an anti-synergistic effect. Methods: The chemical fertilizers and sustained release organic fertilizers used were 16200, 4600 and 666, respectively, and the amount was 31.25 gm2. Findings: Higher fertilization stimulated harvesting, resulting in higher yields and higher proportions of good grain, but less efficient GHG reductions. The ratio of zeolite 4A to fertilizer should be higher than 3: 1 to reduce the increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the use of fertilizer. This treatment resulted in an emission reduction efficiency of 34.69% in proportion to 21.62 g CO2eq m2 g1 zeolite. Conclusion: In the current study, two applications, fertilizer and zeolite 4A, showed the best performance in reducing emissions. However, it is advisable to increase the ratio of zeolite to fertilizer. Similarly, sustained release organic fertilizers resulted in increased CH4 emissions due to the action of methanogens on organic matter. However, plant growth, good grain proportions, and total grain yields increased. Further research is recommended to investigate the optimal ratio of zeolite 4A to organic and synthetic fertilizers for rice cultivation.</description>

      <title>Economic and Ecological Benefits of SHM Techniques in Chemical Process Industry</title>

      <description>Corinna Hardes, Jochen Moll, Dirk Treppmann, Peter Kraemer, Lars Schubert, Joerg Weidenfeller, Klaus-Peter Kress, E-Journal of nondestructive testing. 29(7)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400147075

                High-performance machine components are involved in a wide range of industrial production processes. They play an important role in the provision of chemical products, pharmaceuticals, and energy resources. They require monitoring because they can fail during production due to corrosion and/or wear, which often means an increased risk to people and the environment. Periodic inspections with on-site test personnel often require a shutdown of the chemical plant. Ideally, an ultrasonic structural health monitoring (SHM) system could be used to provide continuous data on the structural integrity of these components while reducing or eliminating plant downtime. A plant shutdown is not only a high economic or supply risk but can also be energy intensive. In our presentation, we would like to give an overview of the technical requirements for an SHM system to be used in the chemical industry. Finally, the presentation will highlight the economic benefits of SHM as well as its contribution to energy savings and reduction of CO2 emissions per ton of chemical product produced.</description>

                This study critically examines the impact of indoor air quality (IAQ) on occupant health in two critical care units (ICUs) at Jason Sendwe Hospital (JSH) and General Carrier de Mine Hospital (GCMH) within the Southern DRC metropolitan area, focusing on their impact on occupant health and well-being. Utilizing a mixed methods approach that includes health questionnaires, continuous environmental monitoring (monitoring CO2, VOCs, PM2.5, PM10, temperature, and relative humidity), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, this research aims to identify correlations between environmental factors and the health of hospital staff and patients. The investigation was conducted across both the rainy and dry seasons, revealing significant seasonal variations in IEQ parameters and exploring the incidence of symptoms commonly associated with sick building syndrome among hospital staff. Higher CO2, VOCs, and particulate matter levels during the dry season indicated the inadequacy of current ventilation strategies to maintain optimal air quality. This study proposes the implementation of air filtration and purification systems and the refurbishment of natural ventilation systems as effective measures to improve IAQ. Additionally, alternative ventilation strategies, including occupancy reduction and the integration of supply and exhaust ventilation, were explored to address the challenges of inadequate ventilation. The findings reveal the urgent need for hospitals to adopt ventilation strategies that ensure the health and well-being of occupants, highlighting the importance of continuous IAQ monitoring, community engagement, and the integration of advanced ventilation technologies in healthcare settings. This comprehensive exploration offers valuable insights for improving ventilation in ICUs, contributing to creating healthier indoor environments in hospital settings, especially in regions facing unique environmental challenges.</description>

                The reduction of fossil fuels which produce CO2 emission that damage the environment, can be done by implementing renewable energy-based power generations, such as solar and wind. This research designs a hybrid energy system by optimizing the use of existing diesel generators through the integration of renewable energy sources, such as solar photovoltaic and micro wind turbine, and is equipped with an energy storage system. This research uses HOMER Pro software to determine the optimal capacity of hybrid system components, and to calculate the cost of energy (CoE). Furthermore, the hybrid system configuration is analyzed by applying several objectives. The objectives of the hybrid system design are to prioritize a maximum renewable energy penetration ratio within permitted annual capacity shortage and with the CoE lower than the existing CoE. The research results show that the proposed hybrid energy system can provide a renewable energy penetration ratio of 57.1% with CoE of IDR 3,510/kWh.</description>

                Eceng gondok contains chlorophyll which is an oxygenate type additive which can increase the combustion reaction in fuel and reduce exhaust emissions. Therefore, eceng gondok has the potential to be used as a bioadditive in fuel by adding carotene from crude palm oil which functions as an antioxidant through electron transfer, thereby protecting chlorophyll from autooxidation. The two chlorophyll and carotene extracts at a ratio of 0:1, 2:3, 3:1, 4:1, 3:2, and 1:0 respectively were mixed with toluene and Fatty Acid Methyl Ester as a bioadditive formula. in gasoline fuel. The research results show that there is an increase in octane value of 0.1-0.5% according to ASTM D 2699 and GC-FID and results in a reduction in CO and CO2 exhaust emissions of 52.38% and 37% respectively. .00% on the use of chlorophyll : carotene (2:3) bioadditives in gasoline. This shows that eceng gondok and crude palm oil can be used as bioadditives in gasoline motor vehicles.</description>

                A facile synthetic protocol was employed to synthesize new coumarin Schiff base (E)-3-(1-((2-hydroxy-5- methylphenyl)imino)ethyl)-2H-chromen-2-one] and their Co and Cu metal complexes. Synthesized molecules were characterized by various spectroscopic methods. The results of antibacterial studies demonstrated that the maximum level of growth inhibition for S. aureus and B. subtilis was shown by compound 5, with inhibition zones of 16&#177;1 mm and 18.5&#177;1.3 mm, respectively, while, Compound 4 exhibited 12.5&#177;0.5 mm and 14&#177;0.25 mm, respectively. Invitro Cytotoxicity of Cu-complex 5 towards human hepatocellular adenocarcinoma cancer cells, at concentrations of 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 g/mL, displayed a reduction in the percentage of cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, with values of 72.45%, 60.12%, 48.69%, and 23.25%, respectively. The results revealed that Compound 5 has the potential to interact with the bacterial membrane surface, leading to the disruption of the same. Additionally, potentiometric analysis was used to estimate the proton-ligand dissociation constant of HL as well as its metal stability constants with Co2+ and Cu2+ .</description>

      <title>Correlating Optical and Structural Properties of CO on Transition Metal Surfaces</title>

                We present an optical study based on the Quasiparticle Self-Consistent GW (QSGW) approximation, combining structural information taken from density-functional theory (DFT) to elucidate spectral features of CO adsorbed on Pt (111) and Cu (111). Optical information and structural arrangement of the adsorbed CO are correlated by varying both site positions and CO coverage as compared to experimental studies (&#952; = &#188; to &#952; = &#189;). This enables us to resolve key spectral features of both occupied and unoccupied molecular states at various adsorbate coverages, comparing theory to experiment. Using experimental data as benchmarks: we show the theory compares well with available data. Its predictive power provides a new path to infer information about the structure of CO from optical information, and can help to predict the presence of other little understood adsorbates such as an OCCO dimer, that may be relevant to mechanistic pathways for reduction of CO2 to high value C2+ products. This new approach complements total energy calculations, and also fills a void in DFT based theory that is known to be an unreliable predictor of the energetics of CO on transition metal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Grain Fragmentation Creates High-Density Boundaries for Efficient CO2-to-C2+ Electro-conversion at Ampere-Level Current Density</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2024.109945</link>

                Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce multi-carbon products (C2+) is one of the most sustainable manners to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. Among many approaches, enriching grain boundaries (GBs) in copper (Cu) catalysts has been demonstrated to enable enhancement for C2+ production. However, it still lacks effective strategies to controllably synthesize abundant GBs, rendering efficient C2+ production a persistent challenge, especially at ampere-level current density. Herein, we propose a novel strategy, which can achieve unconventional grain fragmentation during thermal annealing and thus create controllable GB densities. The catalyst with the utmost GB density exhibits a peak C2+ faradaic efficiency (FE) of ca. 70.0% in an H-type cell and 68.2% in a flow cell; even more impressively, it delivers an ultra-high C2+ current density of 0.768 A cm-2, outperforming most recently reported results. A combination of in situ spectroscopies and theoretical calculations reveal that the enrichment of GBs yields more active sites for a higher &#8270;CO coverage, leading to promotion of the &#8270;CO-&#8270;CO coupling process and ultimately high C2+ production performance.</description>

      <title>Hydrogeological and Mining Considerations in the Design of a Pumping Station in a Shaft of a Closed Black Coal Mine</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17133297</link>
      <description>Kajetan d&#8217;Obyrn, Pawe&#322; Kami&#324;ski, Damian Cie&#324;, Sebastian Jendrysik, D. Prosta&#324;ski, Energies. 17(13)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400366397

                In an overwhelming number of cases, the closure of a coal mine in Poland, for safety reasons, requires the installation of a pumping station and systems for the drainage of inflowing water due to its connection via roadways, goaves, or water-leaking pillars with other adjacent active mines. Due to operational costs, stationary pumping stations are being replaced with submersible pumping stations, wherever the geological/mining conditions allow this. The key factors to be considered when designing a submersible pumping station include the estimated water influx and the storage and emergency reservoir fill-up time. If the water level in the emergency reservoir exceeds the level of the maximum ordinate, there is the risk of water flooding an adjacent active mine, which poses a serious safety risk to this mine. A pumping station design must ensure that water can be pumped out also in emergency situations and must ensure permanent control over the level of the water table. The pumped-out water, after potential treatment, can be utilized as technological water in industrial plants. In the designed pumping station, it is also feasible to establish underground pumped-storage hydropower. This would enable the storage of energy from renewable sources, thereby contributing to CO2 emission reduction.</description>

      <title>Measuring Exsolution Rates of Gases in a Laboratory Analog for Enceladus Plume Formation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2024-1314</link>
      <description>Lucas M. Fifer, J. D. Toner, K. E. Saavik Ford, Benjamin Mousseau, Fabian Klenner, David C. Catling, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400287625

                Introduction:&amp;#160; Enceladus&amp;#8217;s erupting plume likely originates from a subsurface ocean, and thus represents an avenue for revealing the ocean composition. The plume composition was measured by two mass spectrometers on Cassini during flythroughs of the plume. These measurements currently provide our best means of estimating Enceladus&amp;#8217;s ocean chemistry and the moon&amp;#8217;s potential to host life. The Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA; Srama et al. 2004) measured the composition of ice grains in the plume and Saturn&amp;#8217;s E ring, finding a variety salts (including biologically useful phosphate) and organic molecules that could be hydrothermal, primordial, or possibly biological in origin (e.g., Postberg et al. 2018, 2023; Khawaja et al. 2019). The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS; Waite et al. 2006) analyzed the gases in the plume and detected CO2, NH3, H2, CH4 and HCN, which suggests conditions in the ocean are likely favorable for chemotrophy (e.g., methanogenesis) and possibly prebiotic chemistry (e.g., Waite et al. 2017, Peter et al. 2023).Motivation: However, the relative abundances of key molecules in the plume may be quite different in the ocean due to fractionating processes during eruption (Fifer et al. 2022). The effects of fractionation are important when considering how the plume gas represents (or misrepresents) the abundances of gases in the ocean. For instance, condensation of water vapor onto the icy walls of the tiger stripe fissures can cause gases like CO2 to have much higher abundances (relative to water) in the plume than in the ocean (Glein et al. 2015; Glein &amp;amp; Waite 2020; Fifer et al. 2022). In a competing fractionation, the differential exsolution of gases from Enceladus&amp;#8217;s ocean will tend to enrich water vapor in the plume relative to other gases (Fifer et al. 2022). While CDA in situ measurements suggest that the ocean&amp;#8217;s pH is ~8.5 &amp;#8211; 10.5 (e.g., Postberg et al. 2009, Postberg et al. 2023), studies to account for fractionation and estimate ocean gas content and pH from the plume measurements have produced a wide range of possible ocean compositions, with pH ~6&amp;#8211;13 (e.g., Marion et al. 2012; Glein et al. 2015). Thus, quantifying fractionation in the plume gas during eruption can better determine the ocean composition.Here, we used laboratory experiments to constrain a key fractionation process: the exsolution of gases at the liquid-gas interface.Methods:&amp;#160; In a stainless steel vessel at 0&amp;#176;C, we added pure water or saline solutions and degassed them under vacuum. We then introduced a single gas (e.g., CO2) and allowed it to dissolve to equilibrium. We monitored the headspace pressure and partially evacuated the headspace gas, driving gas exsolution in an analogous process to how the plumes may form from a water-filled fissure on Enceladus. We can calculate a mass transfer coefficient associated with exsolution by monitoring the increasing headspace pressure during exsolution and deriving the concentration remaining in solution. We also used a stir bar to investigate the effects of stirring or mixing on exsolution.Results:&amp;#160; We find a positive linear correlation between stir rate and mass transfer coefficient for CO2 (Figure 1) consistent with previous experiments investigating gas transfer in water (Nishimura et al. 1991). Notably, our mass transfer coefficients are comparable to those derived for ocean-atmosphere exchange on Earth (Broecker &amp;amp; Peng 1982). In trials using a 0.2 NaCl solution, we found a reduction in the mass transfer coefficient of CO2 by ~25% compared to pure water, which is larger than in previous studies (~10%) for CO2 diffusion in NaCl solutions (Zhang et al. 2015).Figure 1: Mass transfer coefficient for CO2 exsolution from pure water as a function of stir rate in solution. Conclusions: We find that the mass transfer coefficient of CO2 strongly depends on the rate of stirring. For Enceladus&amp;#8217;s plume formation, this means that an observed flux of erupting gas could originate from either a well-mixed ocean with low gas concentrations or a poorly-mixed ocean with higher gas concentrations. Therefore, it is important to quantify the degree of mixing in the surface ocean where the plume gas is likely sourced.&amp;#160;References:Broecker, W.S., and Peng, T.H.. 1982. Tracers in the Sea.

      <title>One-Step Fabrication of Composite Hydrophobic Electrically Heated Graphene Surface for Anti-Icing</title>

                Ice accumulation poses considerable challenges in transportation, notably in the domain of general aviation. The present study combines the strengths and limitations of conventional aircraft de-icing techniques with the emerging trend toward all-electric aircraft. The study aims to utilize laser-induced graphene (LIG) technology to create a multifunctional surface, seamlessly integrating hydrophobic properties with efficient electrical heating to mitigate surface icing effectively. We investigated the utilization of a 10.6 &#956;m CO2 laser for direct writing on polyimide (PI), a widely-used insulating encapsulation material. From the thermomechanical perspective, our initial analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics software revealed that when the laser power P exceeds 5 W, the PI substrate experience ablative damage. The experimental results show that when P &#8804; 5W, an increase in power has a positive impact on the quality, surface porosity, roughness reduction, line-spacing reduction, and water contact-angle enhancement of the graphene. Conversely, when P &amp;amp;gt; 5 W, higher power negatively affects both the substrate and the graphene structure by inducing excessive ablation. However, it influences the graphene line height positively and is consistent with overall experimental-simulation congruence. Furthermore, the incorporation of high-quality graphene resulted in a surface that exhibited higher contact angles (CA &amp;amp;gt; 120&#176;), lower energy consumption, and higher heating efficiency compared to the use of traditional electrically heated materials for anti-icing applications. The potential applications of this one-step fabrication method extend across various industries, particularly aviation, marine engineering, and other ice-prone domains. Moreover, the method has extensive prospects for addressing pivotal challenges associated with ice formation and serves an innovative and efficient anti-icing technology.</description>

                Abstract This research uses the sol-gel method to look into how adding Co2+ and Ce3+ dopant cations changes the structure, shape, and electrical properties of M-type Ba hexagonal ferrites that have been synthesized. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirms the successful formation of the targeted hexagonal M-type crystal structure. We observed a reduction in unit cell volume and lattice parameters as the dopant concentration increased, indicating the effective incorporation of dopant ions into the crystal lattice. When the doping process happened, needle-like grain shapes appeared, which could be seen with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM).&amp;#xD;As the concentration of the dopant increased, the dielectric spectroscopic measurements revealed an increase in the loss tangent (tan &#948;) from 0.05 to 3.68, and a decrease in the dielectric constant (&#949;&#8242;) from 283 to 3.41. This suggests a reduction in polarization and dielectric permittivity, as well as increased energy dissipation within the material. The electric modulus spectra showed relaxation behaviour that was non-Debye-type, which is another sign that there are complex and multifaceted ways for charges to move. The measurements of relaxation time and AC conductivity showed that the relaxation intervals were not regular and that the conductivity dropped from 2.22*10-4 &#937;&#8315;&#185;m&#8315;&#185; to 1.4*10-7 &#937;&#8315;&#185;m&#8315;&#185; as the doping concentration increased. Based on these findings, it seems that the processes of conductivity and dielectric relaxation play a big role in how charges move around in the doped ferrites. We validated complex impedance data obtained through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) software against calculated impedance values. The derived grain and grain boundary characteristics also agreed with the observed grain distribution and boundaries from the micrographs, further corroborating the analysis.</description>

                The decentralization of electricity authority in Nigeria has made it expedient for the South-West Geopolitcal Zone to develop strategic power generation infrastructure. This study assessed the techno-economic viability of the liquefied petroleum gas-powered alternative electricity infrastructure option in Southwestern Nigeria as a mitigation strategy to endemic inadequate grid power supply under the region's integrated electric power programmes. An energy project planning and foresight analysis methodology was used. The study showed that a 25 MW stand-alone LPG-based CHP power plant would require 8.567 acres of land, consume approximately 15.459 million kg of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) annually, while generating 210,240 MWh of electricity annually. This power plant initiative was considered to have acceptable risk (Payback Period = 9 years 3 months; Return on Investment = 10.73%) and viability at the minimum tariff of $0.11/kWh. It also had considerable annual CO2 emissions and fuel cost savings (255.75 metric kilotonnes and $137.58 million respectively) relative to diesel-based alternative power generation. The study recommended that the viability of the power plant be improved by reductions in operations costs. The study concluded that the LPG plant initiative was technically feasible, economically viable and environmentally friendly, and suitable for deployment in the study area.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Properties and Durability of Composite Cement Pastes Containing Phase-Change Materials and Nanosilica</title>

                Escalating global surface temperatures are highlighting the urgent need for energy-saving solutions. Phase-change materials (PCMs) have emerged as a promising avenue for enhancing thermal comfort in the construction sector. This study assessed the impact of incorporating PCMs ranging from 1% to 10% by mass into composite Portland cement partially replaced by fly ash (FA) and nanosilica particles (NS). Mechanical and electrochemical techniques were utilized to evaluate composite cements. The results indicate that the presence of PCMs delayed cement hydration, acting as a filler without chemically interacting within the composite. The combination of FA and PCMs reduced compressive strength at early ages, while thermal conductivity decreased after 90 days due to the melting point and the latent heat of PCMs. Samples with FA and NS showed a significant reduction in the CO2 penetration, attributed to their pozzolanic and microfiller effects, as well as reduced water absorption due to the non-absorptive nature of PCMs. Nitrogen physisorption confirmed structural changes in the cement matrix. Additionally, electrical resistivity and thermal behavior assessments revealed that PCM-containing samples could reduce temperatures by an average of 4 &#176;C. This suggested that PCMs could be a viable alternative for materials with thermal insulation capacity, thereby contributing to energy efficiency in the construction sector.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Drought on Photosynthesis in Major Food Crops and the Related Mechanisms of Plant Responses to Drought</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/plants13131808</link>

                Drought stress is one of the most critical threats to crop productivity and global food security. This review addresses the multiple effects of drought on the process of photosynthesis in major food crops. Affecting both light-dependent and light-independent reactions, drought leads to severe damage to photosystems and blocks the electron transport chain. Plants face a CO2 shortage provoked by stomatal closure, which triggers photorespiration; not only does it reduce carbon fixation efficiency, but it also causes lower overall photosynthetic output. Drought-induced oxidative stress generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) that damage cellular structures, including chloroplasts, further impairing photosynthetic productivity. Plants have evolved a variety of adaptive strategies to alleviate these effects. Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) mechanisms help dissipate excess light energy as heat, protecting the photosynthetic apparatus under drought conditions. Alternative electron pathways, such as cyclical electron transmission and chloroplast respiration, maintain energy balance and prevent over-reduction of the electron transport chain. Hormones, especially abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, and cytokinin, modulate stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content, and osmotic adjustment, further increasing the tolerance to drought. Structural adjustments, such as leaf reordering and altered root architecture, also strengthen tolerance. Understanding these complex interactions and adaptive strategies is essential for developing drought-resistant crop varieties and ensuring agricultural sustainability.</description>

                This study aims at evaluating the anticancer effect on the MCF-7 (Michigan Cancer Foundation-7) cell line of human breast cancer using Thymoquinone and Tamoxifen alone as well as in combination therapy by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) Test. NCCS in Pune provided the MCF-7 cell line. The cells were kept at 37&#176;C in a humidified medium of 50&#181;g/ml CO2 in Minimal Essential Medium added with 10percent FBS (Foetal Bovine Serum), streptomycin (100&#181;g/ml), as well as penicillin (100U/ml). MTT-(3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) test was conducted on MCF-7 cell line for Thymoquinone and Tamoxifen as sole and combination therapy. Measurements were performed using UV (Ultra-Violet)-spectrophotometer at 570-nanometre absorbance and the content needed for a 50 percent inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated and evaluated graphically. IC 50 of Thymoquinone on MCF 7 was found to be at 31.2 &#181;g/ml and Tamoxifen was at 62.5 &#181;g/ml were as in combination therapy the IC 50 was found to be at 7.8 &#181;g/ml. There is a remarkable reduction in concentration to achieve IC 50 percentage in combination therapy with a comparison with individual therapy. Therefore, the combination therapy of Thymoquinone and Tamoxifen on the MCF-7 cell line is more efficacious when compared to individual treatment on cell viability inhibition.</description>

                Microbial communities of terrestrial mud volcanoes are involved in aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidation, but the biological mechanisms of these processes are still understudied. We have investigated the taxonomic composition, rates of methane oxidation, and metabolic potential of microbial communities in five mud volcanoes of the Taman Peninsula, Russia. Methane oxidation rates measured by the radiotracer technique varied from 2.0 to 460 nmol CH4 cm&#8722;3 day&#8722;1 in different mud samples. This is the first measurement of high activity of microbial methane oxidation in terrestrial mud volcanos. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing has shown that Bacteria accounted for 65&#8211;99% of prokaryotic diversity in all samples. The most abundant phyla were Pseudomonadota, Desulfobacterota, and Halobacterota. A total of 32 prokaryotic genera, which include methanotrophs, sulfur or iron reducers, and facultative anaerobes with broad metabolic capabilities, were detected in relative abundance &gt;5%. The most highly represented genus of aerobic methanotrophs was Methyloprofundus reaching 36%. The most numerous group of anaerobic methanotrophs was ANME-2a-b (Ca. Methanocomedenaceae), identified in 60% of the samples and attaining relative abundance of 54%. The analysis of the metagenome-assembled genomes of a community with high methane oxidation rate indicates the importance of CO2 fixation, Fe(III) and nitrate reduction, and sulfide oxidation. This study expands current knowledge on the occurrence, distribution, and activity of microorganisms associated with methane cycle in terrestrial mud volcanoes.</description>

                Successfully made adsorbent of activated carbon made from purple corn cob which aims to minimize ammonia (NH3) levels found in water in fish farming with cage ponds. Activated carbon using carbonization method with a change in temperature that is between 550&#176;C, 600&#176;C, and 650&#176;C and activation using Na2CO3 solution as activator. Activated carbon that has been obtained has exceeded the standard of SNI No.06-3730-1995, with characteristics including carbon yield ranging from 79.71% to 89.85%, moisture content ranging from 11.3% to 25.4%, volatile matter content ranging from 10.10% to 24.5%, ash content ranging from 9.7% to 9.9%, and fixed carbon content ranging from 65.7% to 79.7%. Then test results were obtained such as CO2 functional groups were found to enhance the adsorption process. Activated carbon displays the presence of a predominantly amorphous structure but also revealed a crystalline carbon structure. The highest peak was obtained at 29.7&#176; with Miller index (201). The activated carbon displays the presence of pores on the scattered surface with carbon elements dominating. Adsorption mechanism to reduce ammonia (NH3) using activated carbon due to intermolecular interaction process. So that when testing the application for ammonia absorption, the best results were obtained in the sample with an adsorbent mass of 1.50 g at a carbonization temperature of 650&#176;C with an adsorption capacity value of 546.34 mg/g and ammonia reduction of 82%. This research can open up opportunities for the potential development of new materials, especially for fish farming through cage techniques.</description>

      <title>System Optimization and Operating Strategy of Single-Stage Air Source Heat Pump with Thermal Storage to Reduce Wind Power Curtailment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14071993</link>
      <description>Qiangyu Ren, Chuang Gao, Jie Jia, Buildings. 14(7)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400209483

                Wind power generation has increased in China to achieve the target of decreasing CO2 emissions by 2050, but there are high levels of wind curtailment due to the mismatch between electricity supply and demand. This paper proposes a single-stage air source heat pump coupled with thermal storage for building heating purposes. The main objective is to find the proper system designs and operating strategy, which can help to avoid peak demand periods while obtaining minimized running costs and reduced wind energy curtailment. Dynamic simulations were performed using TRNSYS to investigate its use in a typical office building based on an actual electricity tariff, wind power, and meteorological data. The proper system designs, including the tank size and thermal storage temperature, were determined to maximize the system&#8217;s performance. It was found that a proper combination of the two parameters exists for a specific application. Further, results showed that the use of auxiliary electric heating is necessary for single-stage air source heat pumps to participate in a wind curtailment reduction. The operating strategy of the system was also studied. Results indicate that by implementing a proper operating strategy, non-renewable power consumption can be reduced by 11% for the studied building, with a total wind power utilization of 3348 kWh during the heating season while still satisfying the heating demands of users. These findings can contribute to the green and low-carbon development of the building industry and further enhance the grid&#8217;s accommodation capacity for renewable energy sources.</description>

      <title>Technology Focus: Decarbonization (July 2024)</title>

                While significant progress has been made in carbon abatement, evidenced in literature produced over the past year, particularly within the realm of carbon capture and storage (CCS), I&#8217;d like to invite your attention to three key topics in this discussion. First, despite more than 3 decades of intense focus on emissions issues, highlighted since the 1980s and formalized with the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, global emissions have only increased instead of going down. It&#8217;s imperative to question the efficacy, premises, practicality, and overlooked hurdles of current approaches. Paper SPE 214950, summarized here, sheds light on some of these challenges. It emphasizes that implementing costly carbon-abatement methods in a world marked by sharp regional economic disparities with wealth concentrated in a few countries could worsen economic inequalities by making access to energy even less equitable. Additionally, paper SPE 215050 (included in the list for further reading) underscores the priority of energy security over carbon reduction, citing recent evidence from leading proponent nations of climate action resorting to the use of coal. Failing to address energy security and economic disparity, though these are not the only obstacles, could hinder progress toward societal carbon-reduction goals. My second topic for your kind attention is the progress made on the CCS front, on which an overwhelming number of papers (approximately 75% of those reviewed) were presented at SPE conferences last year. An ongoing challenge with CCS, particularly in deep saline aquifers, is the prolonged period required for injected CO2 to chemically react and solidify for permanent storage. Paper SPE 215352, summarized here, introduces a different perspective based on the author&#8217;s exposure to another industry: proposing the coinjection of CaCl2 to expedite the permanent storage of CO2, potentially addressing this issue. The third topic that you will find interesting is developments on the hydrogen front, aimed at replacing direct use of fossil fuels as energy vectors. The cost of producing green hydrogen is expected to come down with advancement of technology, at least in some geographical areas, as the second paper shortlisted for further reading, paper IPTC 23652, suggests. One promising application involves using excess solar power during the day to convert hydrogen and store it underground for use when sunlight is unavailable. This could green the so-called peaker plants. While the approach of underground hydrogen storage (UHS) undoubtedly has the advantage of storing large amounts of energy, it may still struggle to compete with utility-scale battery storage in terms of the associated round-trip energy efficiency. There are many technoeconomic challenges to be solved in the hydrogen-based energy approach, including in the UHS context, before it can be used at a significant scale. Despite some previous experience with controlled and small-scale application of UHS, much remains to be learned about its safety and economics. The risks include leakage hazards, underground chemical reactions, loss from residual trapping, and contamination, among others. However, papers like IPTC 23943, one summarized here, along with the third one selected for further reading, paper SPE 215489, underline the necessity and the strides being made by the engineering community in overcoming these technological challenges.

      <title>IPSL Climactions and the bottom-up ecological transformation of a climate and planetary science research institute (2016-2024)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2024-1054</link>
      <description>L&#233;a Bonnefoy, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400288285

                For several decades now, research communities working on the climate, its changes, including current global warming, and its consequences have been recommending drastic reductions in human-made greenhouse gas emissions and, more generally, in the ecological footprint of human activities. This implies the implementation over the next 10 to 20 years of profound and rapid systemic transformations. The latest IPCC reports show that such transformations are only possible if they involve all parts/sectors of society. Given the existence of a range of ecological constraints and the foreseeable limits to scientific and technical advances, the transformations to be implemented must also include a strong component of sufficiency ("avoidance&amp;#8221;).The IPSL (Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace) is a federation of academic research laboratories in the region of Paris, France, incl. CEREA, GEOPS, LATMOS, LISA, LMD, LOCEAN, LSCE, and METIS, which address all climate-relevant components of the Earth System, but also study other planets of the solar system. Since 2016, IPSL scientists and support staff have been working together along these lines to transform the institute's professional practices.&amp;#160; This engagement is generally seen as : (i) a necessity: to initiate a transition in its research practices that will bring its professional behavior in line with the message of climate urgency that it has been diffusing for over 30 years; (ii) an opportunity: to accelerate the transition at a societal level by opening up new channels of exchange with society, encouraging collective action by example, and reinforcing the credibility of its warning message; (iii) a safeguard: collective bottom-up thinking at laboratory level to ensure that this transition takes place with maximum respect for our research practices and our well-being at work, and is not imposed by potentially inappropriate top-down measures.Achievements include (i) the development of methodologies for calculating the carbon footprint generated by staff activities and professional practices, (ii) concrete contributions to the reduction of the environmental footprint of professional travels, digital and high performance computing activities, purchases and finally observation of the earth. So far, the carbon footprint reduction efforts do not affect research methods, which constitute the core of the institute&amp;#8217;s activity. However, the carbon emissions of the institute cannot be significantly reduced without a profound change in the way climate and planetary research are conducted, including data collection techniques (field campaigns, space missions, polar stations, etc), supercomputing, or laboratory instruments. The central question we are asking is: how do we continue to do new and interesting planetary science today while minimizing carbon emissions and other environmental impacts? A collective discussion around this thematic has been initiated in the IPSL; we will present here our approach, methodologies, achievements, and reflections at this stage, with the hope to stimulate exchange with other ongoing or emerging initiatives in other parts of the world.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Figure 1: Carbon footprint of the IPSL for 2019, with the contribution of each category given in CO2 equivalent tons.</description>

                &lt;div class="section abstract"&gt;&lt;div class="htmlview paragraph"&gt;Engine and aftertreatment solutions have been identified to meet the upcoming ultra-low NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; regulations on heavy duty vehicles in the United States. These standards will require changes to current conventional aftertreatment systems for dealing with low exhaust temperature scenarios while increasing the useful life of the engine and aftertreatment system. Previous studies have shown feasibility of meeting the US EPA and California Air Resource Board (CARB) requirements. This work includes a 15L diesel engine equipped with cylinder deactivation (CDA) and an aftertreatment system that was fully DAAAC aged to 800,000 miles. The aftertreatment system includes an e-heater (electric heater), light-off Selective Catalytic Reduction (LO-SCR) followed by a primary aftertreatment system containing a DPF and SCR. The e-heater was capable of providing up to 10 kW, however for the purpose of this project, lower power settings of 2.5 kW and 5 kW were studied in combination with CDA for lowest possible CO2 emissions. Test cycles included the heavy duty FPT (hot and cold), a low load cycle, a beverage cycle, and a stay hot operation. The data found in this study show how the application of a low power e-heater enables an engine with CDA and an aftertreatment system after 800,000 miles aging to meet ultra-low NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions with minimum CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; penalty.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                Nuclear power plants and research purposed reactors produce spent nuclear fuel, which leads to a need for safe spent fuel management and radiation protection. Traditionally, concrete with the addition of different aggregates has been the primary material for shielding against radiation and is used also for transport and storage of radioactive waste. Despite these applications, there is still a need to develop new composite materials that will preserve the radiation shielding properties of concrete, while offering superior mechanical and also cost effective benefits. This article investigates the radiation shielding properties of HI-STORM containers, made of a new composite material, and reinforced with basalt-boron fibre for human and environment protection. In the concrete recipe, part of the cement is replaced by oil shale ash with cementitious characteristics. The formulation of concrete reinforced with basalt-boron fibre (with the addition of 6% boron oxide) is presented. Oil shale ash (OSA) is a class-C fly ash, a by-product in the energy production process. OSA can be used as a partial replacement to cement in concretes, thanks to its cement-like qualities and low carbon content, which contributes to a reduction in the overall CO2 footprint of concrete. In our investigated concrete mixes 5 to 35% of cement was replaced by OSA (Electrostatic Precipitator Ash) coming from Auvere (Estonia) thermal power plant. Using the Monte Carlo method, the Serpent code was used to simulate the passage of neutron radiation through a composite material to assess its biological shielding properties. It is shown that the addition of basalt-boron fibre to concrete improves the protective properties of biological shielding against neutron radiation.</description>

      <title>SEQUENTIAL EXTRACTION OF SELECTED HEAVY METALS IN THE SOILS OF ABUJA, NIGERIA</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.33003/fjs-2024-0803-2451</link>
      <description>Raheek I. Ibrahim, Mary Sunday Dauda, N. C. Igwemmar, Bello Abdullahi Abdu, Fudma Journal of Sciences. 8(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400262434

                Speciation of selected heavy metals in Abuja metropolitan soil samples was investigated using a sequential extraction analytical technique. Flame atomic absorption spectrometer was used for instrumental analysis. Metals were bound in six operational phases, in the sequential extraction method. Pb, Mn and Cd speciate more in exchangeable, As and Ni speciate more in bound to carbonate, Cu and Fe speciate more in bound to Fe-Mn oxide, Cr and Zn speciate more in organically bound while Al speciate more in residual in urban soil samples. In sub-urban samples, Pb and Cd speciate more in exchangeable and bound to Fe-Mn oxide, Cu speciate more in exchangeable, Al speciate more in bound to Fe-Mn oxide, Fe and Al speciate more in residual, Ni and As speciate more in bound to carbonate, Zn speciate more in organically bound and Cr speciate more in exchangeable and organically bound. Asokoro Forest (control) has most of the metals as non-residuals except Al and As which speciate more in residual phase. Sequence of ionic mobility in decreasing order for Abuja urban soils is as follows: Zn&gt;Cu&gt;Fe&gt;Al&gt;Mn&gt;&gt;As&gt;Ni&gt;Cr&gt;Cd&gt;Pb and in sub-urban soil samples is: Zn&gt;Cu&gt;Fe&gt;Al&gt;Mn&gt;&gt;Ni&gt;As&gt;Pb&gt;Cd&gt;Cr. From the results, it can be deduced that Zn is the ion with highest speciation. This portends danger to Abuja metropolis due to Zn phytoxicity which hinders photosynthesis in plants, thereby increasing the amount of CO2 giving rise to global warming. This requires that relevant authorities should enforce reduction of the activities that lead to abundance of Zn in Abuja soils.</description>

      <title>Public attitudes and emotions toward novel carbon removal methods in alternative sociotechnical scenarios</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad5dd0</link>
      <description>Emily Cox, Rob Bellamy, Laurie Waller, Environmental research letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400225090

                Abstract Despite high expectations about the role of carbon removal in meeting global climate targets, many of the proposed techniques remain nascent. This is especially so for techniques with potential for large-scale, permanent removal of CO2, such as Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) and Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE). In such a context, understanding public attitudes is crucial but challenging, since we do not have enough information about the sociotechnical configurations which might accompany such proposals over future timescales. Carbon removal at scale will not take place in a vacuum &#8211; it will co-evolve within political, social, economic, and legal structures which in turn will have a strong influence on public attitudes. This study used a nationally-representative survey (n=1,978) in the UK to test the impact of alternative sociotechnical systems on public attitudes to DACCS and OAE. Participants were randomly assigned to one of five scenario conditions, representing different forms of governance logic (top-down vs bottom-up) and market logic (planned vs liberal economy), plus one with minimal sociotechnical information. We find that the scenario condition significantly impacted perceptions of OAE, with participants preferring its implementation within a bottom-up, planned economy scenario, and rejecting scenarios which most closely resembled the status quo. There were no significant differences between scenarios for DACCS, suggesting that the technology may be more flexible across alternative sociotechnical arrangements. OAE arouses more negative emotions, particularly worry about impacts on ocean ecosystems, whereas DACCS arouses more hope. We found that climate worry is associated with stronger emotions &#8211; both positive and negative &#8211; toward both techniques, thus CDR could be polarising for the most climate-worried, likely due to tensions between climate urgency and concerns about deterring emissions reductions. The most important criteria for future CDR deployment were deemed to be biodiversity, durability, and cost, with a strong discourse around the current cost-of-living crisis.</description>

      <title>Effects of Cascara Cherry and Other Coffee Litter Mulching on Soil Properties, Photosynthesis, and Water Use Efficiency of Coffea Canephora Pierre ex A. Froehner cv. Reyan No.1 Seedling</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy14071418</link>
      <description>Ang Zhang, S. S. Chen, Xin Lin, Yongjun Lin, Yanli Huang, Yue Sun, Qian Zhao, Shuqin Zhao, Lihua Li, Yuzhou Long, Yuchen Dong, Agronomy. 14(7)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400213717

                Mulching cultivation with agricultural wastes is the main production pattern of coffee at present, but the effect of mulching cultivation on photosynthetic physiological processes of coffee plants is still not clear. Therefore, a randomized block design was adopted to establish a field experiment by one-year-old Coffee Canephora seedlings in this study. There were four types of mulch treatments, including non-mulch coffee waste (C), mulching coffee litter (L), mulching coffee cascara (cherry pericarp, P), and mulching coffee litter and cascara (LP) in this field experiment. Soil properties and microenvironment (e.g., moisture, temperature, pH, bulk density, organic matter content, alkali-hydrolyzed nitrogen content, available potassium content, and available potassium content), agronomic traits (e.g., specific leaf area, leaf area index, plant height, and relative chlorophyll content), and photosynthetic indices (e.g., photosynthesis, transpiration, respiration, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, water use efficiency, and carbon use efficiency) were investigated to determine the effects of different coffee waste mulches on the photosynthetic physiology of coffee seedlings. The results show that coffee litter and cascara mulch significantly reduced soil temperature by 0.42 or 0.33 &#176;C, respectively, and coffee litter rather than cascara mulch significantly increased the soil&#8217;s available potassium content by 46.28%, although coffee waste mulch did not affect other soil properties or microenvironment indices; coffee cascara mulching significantly increased the specific leaf area and net and gross photosynthesis of coffee by 45.46%, 78.33%, and 91.72%, respectively, but the mulching treatments did not affect stomatal conductance, transpiration, or carbon use efficiency in this study. Additionally, coffee cascara mulching increased leaf respiration and net and gross water use efficiency by 109.34%, 80.54%, and 104.95%, respectively. The coffee cascara mulching alone had the most significant positive impact on the photosynthetic index, followed by a combination of litter and cascara, litter alone, and the control treatment. The observed variations in the coffee photosynthetic index may be attributed to the reduction of soil temperature caused by mulching treatments rather than the increase in soil nutrients content. These results indicate that coffee cascara mulching could effectively promote photosynthesis and the growth of coffee seedlings by improving the soil microenvironment.</description>

                The paper is dedicated to power and environmental aspects of option the most appropriate types of fuel for supplying the economics of European countries and Ukraine. Accordingly notions about influence of C-containing fuels on greenhouse effect and on warming of environment, the existing tendency of substitution the fossil fuels &#8212; generally &#8212; and the natural gas &#8212; particularly &#8212; for methane-hydrogen mixtures is discussed as a controversial point. The problem of advancement the national fuel complexes is under consideration and has been studied with approach based upon the example of Ukrainian pre-war state of economics. An attention has been paid up on reduction of production and consumption of all types of the fossil fuels in the last decades, mainly due lowering the industrial using constituent. An enhancement of fuel using efficiency due improvement of furnace equipment basis provides an successive solution the fuel problems. The thermodynamic background for evaluation the efficiency of fuel using with account of the furnace&#8217;s non-ideality has been developed. The problem of &#8220;wet combustion&#8221; takes of special significance by the reason of weather and climate conditions&#8217; account, on the one hand, and an opportunity to control the efficiency of fuel using, on the other hand, with new combined technique. The contemporary approach consists in combination the direct method of decrease the CO2 emission due exclusion of using the C-containing fuels (firstly &#8212; the fossil fuels) and with enhancement the efficiency of using the fossil fuels, for example due erection the recuperative heat recovery facilities with preliminary preheating of combustion air, in some advanced cases by combination with an air, humidification. The perspective ways of provision the decarbonization of environment consists in substitution the fossil fuels (mainly the natural gas NG) for hydrogen or H2-containing gas mixtures. The thermodynamic analysis of relevant technique has been carried out to estimate the opportunities of control the efficiency of hydrogen admixture to NG. Taking into account the variety of technologies of hydrogen production, the engineering method with giving of conditional coloration of hydrogen as a fuel has been considered. The &#8220;green&#8221; H2 makes the most valuable type of fuel (compared with &#8220;blue&#8221;, &#8220;turquoise&#8221;, &#8220;yellow&#8221;, &#8220;rose&#8221; colored and especially to the &#8220;grey&#8221; H2) as a substituting fuel from the standpoint of H2 fitness to process and plant. Particularly for high-temperature melting furnaces a provision of maximum emissivity of flame requires an using of carbon containing fuels to organize thermal pyrolysis of gas and soot formation within the combustion zone.

      <title>Organic cofactors as connection between minerals and protometabolism?</title>

                We can connect the metabolism of the first cells on Earth (Last Universal Common Ancestor, LUCA) to its geochemical roots through top-down comparative bioinformatics[1] and through bottom up geochemical laboratory studies, using minerals and inorganic redox partners (H2, metal ions) as predecessors of enzymes [2]. Our aim is to connect central metabolic cofactors and enzymatic reactions that were present in LUCA to early Earth geochemical reaction partners in order to better understand the transition from environmental reactions to genetically encoded metabolic functions. The hypothesis: cofactors are the missing link between abiotic and biotic (enzymatic) catalysis.In the presented studies, we focus on bridging abiotic and biotic hydrogen/electron transfer. Hydrogen gas, H2, is generated in various geochemical settings, among them serpentinization, a water-rock interaction process during which iron-containing minerals transfer electrons to the protons of water. H2 is also the electron donor for the most ancient route of biological CO2 fixation, the acetyl-CoA pathway. In metabolism itself, H2 is being transformed into biochemical electron donors, cofactors such as the dinucleotide NADH which can be seen &amp;#8211; simply put &amp;#8211; as hydride (H-) donors. We successfully activated hydrogen on minerals found in serpentinizing systems to reduce NAD+ to NADH under aqueous conditions [3].We transferred these principles onto other biochemical electron acceptors such as flavins and have furthermore shown unexpected mechanistic differences between the reduction of di- and mononucleotides.Our results establish a connection between central reactions in metabolism and abiotic, geochemical catalysis with hydrogen as a common denominator.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;References&amp;#160;&amp;#160;[1]&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; M.

                Abstract Study question Melatonin (MLT) is a cytoprotective agent holding potential to prevent cadmium (Cd) toxicity and its impact in testicular function and fertility. Summary answer MLT produced a potent cytoprotective effect in Sertoli cells (SCs) exposed to Cd-toxicity, reducing its H2O2 generation and reductive stress effects by modulation Nrf2 activity. What is known already MLT a hormonal substance exhibiting strong antioxidative and antiapoptotic properties, has been proved to hold great potential as cytoprotec tive agent in a range of tissues and cell models exposed to Cd toxicity, including the rat bone, ovaries, human MSC, and even mammalian testes. However, cellular and mechanistic aspects of this effect of MLT in testes remain poorly understood. Cd is a pro-oxidant heavy metal reported to interfere with testicular function and fertility. Both the toxicity of Cd and the cytoprotective function of MLT involve redox-dependent mechanisms with the activity of Nrf2 transcription factor as key player on the cellular stress response. Study design, size, duration Porcine pre-pubertal SCs were maintained at 37 &#176;C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere in the absence (unexposed-control group) or presence of 5 or 10&#181;M CdCl2 (Sigma Chemical Co.) and/or 50nM MLT (Sigma-Aldrich) for 48h in HAMF12 (Euroclone) supplemented with 0.166nM retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and 5/500ml of Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (ITS) + Premix (Cat. No. 354352; Corning). Participants/materials, setting, methods After treatment the parameters investigated in the study were: a) SCs viability (MTT test); b) SCs functionality parameters AMH and inhibin B. (real-time PCR and ELISA analysis); c) Intracellular and extracellular ROS production ( with Amplex Red and DCFH-DA fluorescent probe respectively); d) Catalase enzyme activity (spectrophotometric assay procedure); e) Nrf2 and other transcription factors (by semi-quantitative microplate confocal microscopy analysis); f) Intracellular and extracellular levels of GSH and other thiols (by HPLC); g) c-Jun and ERK1/2 (Immunoblot). Main results and the role of chance MLT co-treatment significantly prevented the effects of Cd on cell viability and abnormal ROS production. The reduction of H2O2 efflux was very important and combined with an increased CAT activity that was demonstrated upon MLT treatment significantly in SCs exposed to 5&#956;MCd. The co-treatment with MLT compared to Cd treatment, showed a trend toward a significant recovery of AMH and inhibin B gene expression and secretion levels, respectively, demonstrating the cytoprotective effect of MLT in SCs exposed to Cd toxicity at the functional level. In Cd-treated cells, MLT significantly reduced the expression and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 protein, and decreased GSTP induction. However, MLT reduced Cys uptake and stimulated GSH efflux when the cells were treated with 10 &#181;M Cd, suggesting a specific role for the Nrf2-GSTP axis in the cytoprotective response to MLT of Cd-treated SCs. Finally MLT induced MAPK-ERK1-2 pathway and c-Jun transcription factor when the cells were treated with Cd. MLT is a cytoprotective agent in SCs exposed to Cd toxicity capable to restore cell viability and function. Its activity is associated with the modulation of Nrf2 and other stress response genes important in the control of thiols and H2O2 metabolism of SCs, including cJun and MAPKs. Limitations, reasons for caution Other ROS-scavenging genes other than CAT may have a role in the antioxidant response to MLT of SCs, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidases, and peroxyredoxins that are worth investigating further. Wider implications of the findings The aspects that emerged from our study and, described for the first time in these cells, warrant further preclinical and clinical investigation holding potential in the treatment of Cd-induced testicular damage and fertility problems.

      <title>The Development of Fishery-Photovoltaic Complementary Industry and the Studies on Its Environmental, Ecological and Economic Effects in China: A Review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nexus.2024.100316</link>
      <description>Zhihong Zhu, Zhen Song, Sihan Xu, Shoubing Wang, Xingyu Chen, Yongshuang Wang, Zhenhua Zhu, Energy nexus. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400298787

                The fishery-photovoltaic complementary industry is an emerging industrial model in China that integrates aquaculture with the solar industry. This innovative model involves conducting aquaculture activities while installing photovoltaic modules on the water surface to harness solar energy for electricity generation. However, despite its rapid growth in China, this model lacks substantial scientific data support across various domains. Therefore, based on an analysis of relevant research literature, this study reviews the current development status, environmental and economic effects, as well as challenges faced by the fishery-photovoltaic complementary industry in China. The aim is to provide scientific references for promoting sustainable development within this sector. The findings reveal that existing fishery-photovoltaic complementary industry projects are primarily concentrated in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Pearl River Basin. The geographical distribution of these projects is predominantly influenced by local aquaculture areas and available solar energy resources, with a greater impact observed from the former rather than the latter. During summer months when water is shaded by photovoltaic panels, a slight decrease in the average water quality parameters across cases was observed, such as a decrease of 0.2 units in pH, a decrease of 1.06 &#176;C in water temperature, a decrease in dissolved oxygen levels of 0.8 mg/L, inorganic nitrogen content and total phosphorus concentration dropped by 0.08mg/L and 0.02mg/L respectively. Conversely, there is a moderate increase noted in total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen levels. The conclusion of the effect on phytoplankton biomass is not uniform, but it will certainly reduce zooplankton biomass. The impact on the species diversity of the zooplankton community was minimal, and its direction, whether positive or negative, varied depending on the specific aquatic ecosystem. A certain degree of shade is advantageous for the cultivation of shade-loving fish. Through the strategic deployment of photovoltaic panels and the implementation of scientific stocking practices, it is possible to achieve sustained levels of fisheries production. This model also can reduce an average of 978.6 tons of CO2 emissions per megawatt per year through energy production, thus achieving the combined goals of energy conservation and emissions reduction, and ensuring the profitability of power generation. Additionally, compared with the land utilization area of 3.66 hm2 per megawatt of traditional ground-mounted photovoltaics, fishery-photovoltaic complementary only requires 1.64 hm2, which can significantly save land resources by utilizing water surfaces, which mitigates the conflict between land use for agriculture and renewable energy installations. At the same time, research also pointed out that the existence of fishery-photovoltaic complementary will inevitably have some negative impacts on bird communities. Economic analyses indicate that while initial infrastructure costs and long payback periods pose challenges, the overall economic feasibility is promising, especially with governmental support and technological advancements. However, several challenges need to be addressed for further development: these include difficulties associated with infrastructure construction and initial costs, long payback periods; insufficient experience and technical support; as well as a lack of research on ecological and environmental impacts - particularly an urgent need for comprehensive life cycle assessments encompassing both environmental and economic aspects. Future research should focus on life cycle assessments, improved PV technology integration, and optimized aquaculture practices.</description>

      <title>Is Catalonia facing a Megadrought episode?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/ems2024-783</link>
      <description>Vicent Altava-Ortiz, M. Barnolas, A. Barrera-Escoda, Sotiris Assimenidis, Mar&#237;a Cort&#232;s, Marc Prohom, Jordi Mor&#233;, Javier Mart&#237;n&#8208;Vide, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400363843

                Drought is a defining feature of the Mediterranean climate, characterized by frequent periods of precipitation significantly below average. However, the ongoing drought episode affecting Catalonia shows a severity never recorded in the instrumental period 1915-2023. In the case of the city of Barcelona, where precipitation data stretches back to 1786, one must go back to the early 19th century to find a similar 3-year drought period.&amp;#160; Observing the trend of drought episodes over last few decades, the current drought is the latest in a series of episodes of shorter duration and intensity, but which can be also locally classified as exceptional at the time of their occurrence. Consequently, some areas of North-eastern Catalonia have endured conditions similar to semi-permanent drought over the past decade, or even beyond.&amp;#160; The current drought in Catalonia is not an isolated event but part of a broader regional pattern. In general, the entire South-western Europe and Northern Africa have been under drought conditions to a greater or lesser extent in recent years (Faranda et al, 2023). Moreover, other Mediterranean climate regions across the globe, such as Central Chile and California, have lately witnessed record-breaking droughts during the instrumental period, some being classified as Megadroughts (Garreaud et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2022).&amp;#160; More recently, some authors (Cook et al, 2022) have further explored the concept of Megadrought. These episodes have common characteristics beyond their impacts that justify this qualification, including remarkable temporal persistence, unprecedented nature compared with previous events, links with external climatic forcings, or their connection with SST anomalies. &amp;#160; Currently, the global climate system is strongly forced by the increase in CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Climate projections point to a reduction in precipitation for the Mediterranean climate area, which, combined with the increase in temperature values, will lead to greater aridity and the occurrence of droughts with a magnitude never recorded before. In light of these projections and the characteristics exhibited by the current Catalan drought, the question arises: Is Catalonia facing a Megadrought episode?&amp;#160; REFERENCES Cook, B.I., Smerdon, J.E., Cook, E.R. et al.

                Abstract Study question Do Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) supplements impose methylating conditions that influence methylation and transcriptomic profiles during preimplantation period of mouse embryos? Summary answer Subtle differences in embryo methylation profiles were induced by FOCM supplements, despite transcriptomic signatures remained stable and selective genes related to metabolism were activated. What is known already Previous human studies of populations affected by seasonal variations in diet including folate availability have shown methylation changes in specific loci known as metastable epialleles (MEs). MEs exhibit stability across tissues, indicating these could be potential biosensors for heightened sensitivity to external methylating influences in early embryonic stages. Despite significant progress in IVF embryo culture conditions, the sensitivity to the outer metabolic environment during the extensive genomic transformation of embryo reprogramming remains inadequately understood. Study design, size, duration This is a prospective experimental study conducted from January 2023 to December 2023. A total of 111 fresh mouse zygotes (F1 hybrid (B6/CBA)) were subjected embryo culture conditions with different FOCM supplies of 5-MTHF and betaine up to expanded blastocyst stage (105 hours). At different timepoints, individual embryos were collected and disaggregated in individual cells for downstream single-cell analysis. Participants/materials, setting, methods Mouse zygotes were collected from the oviduct, washed and culture in KSOM supplemented with 5-MTHF and betaine at respectively concentrations of 50&#956;M and 50&#956;g/mL (THF/bet(50)), 10&#956;M and 10&#956;g/mL (THF/bet(10)) and no supplement till blastocyst stage at 37 &#176;C, 6%CO2 and 5%O2. Individual embryos were collected at 2 cells, 4 cells, 8 cells, Morula and Blastocyst stage and disaggregated into single cells for subsequent single-cell RNAseq (SmartSeq2) and single-cell methylome analysis through Splinted Ligation Adapter Tagging (scSPLAT). Main results and the role of chance The methylation analysis conducted though scSPLAT revealed a comprehensive reduction in global methylation levels throughout developmental stages. Notably, zygotes exhibited a maximal proportion of methylated cytosines at CpG sites, while blastocysts displayed minimal methylation levels, with sporadic increases in isolated cells. Quantitative profiling indicated lower methylation intensities in treated embryos from zygote to 4 cells, followed by a reversal trend from 8 cells to blastocyst, suggestive of an enhanced assimilation of one-carbon metabolism (FOCM) supplements. Transcriptomic profiles obtained through scRNAseq exhibited correlation with developmental trajectories from zygote to blastocyst. However, no discernible variations were attributed to the combined exposure of Betaine and 5-MTHF. Gene enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes at various timepoints highlighted specific metabolic responses, including mitochondrial oxidative stress and variations in glutathione metabolism. This suggests that the folate forms utilized in this study may possess a protective role as antioxidants, contributing to the observed effects on gene expression during embryonic development. Limitations, reasons for caution The methylation analysis shown in this study was a pilot carried out with low coverage of sequencing deepness, further analysis are ongoing to increase reads coverage. Wider implications of the findings Exposure of mouse embryos to FOCM enhanced global methylation during cell division from 8 cells to blastocyst, indicating heightened assimilation during DNA synthesis. While the transcriptomic signature remained stable, increased expression of genes linked to mitochondrial oxidative stress and glutathione metabolism suggests FOCM&#8217;s potential antioxidant role.

      <title>Volcanic gas plumes&amp;amp;#8217; effects on the spectrum of Venus</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2024-519</link>
      <description>Jo&#227;o Dias, Pedro Machado, S&#233;verine Robert, Justin Erwin, Jo&#227;o C. Duarte, Diogo Quirino, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400291606

                Simulations of spectra during a volcanic eventThe composition and the variability of the lower atmosphere of Venus are critical to understanding the surface-atmosphere interactions, the atmospheric evolution and the volatile exchanges between the interior and the atmosphere [1, 2, 3]. The lower atmosphere can be investigated on the near-infrared spectral windows on the nightside, centered at 1.18 &amp;#181;m (0-15 km), 1.74 &amp;#181;m (20-30 km) and 2.3 &amp;#181;m (30-45 km) [4, 5], which provides a chance to detect volcanic species such as H2O, SO2. CO, HCl and HF, which are common species on Earth volcanoes [3]. The Planetary Spectrum Generator (PSG) [6, 7, 8] was used to simulate the nightside 2.3 &amp;#181;m spectrum of Venus, in nadir-geometry, using a VIRA atmospheric template for temperature and molecular vertical abundance profiles and four aerosol modes, of effective radii of 0.49 &amp;#181;m, 1.18 &amp;#181;m, 1.56 &amp;#181;m and 4.25 &amp;#181;m [9, 10]. The spectral resolution was defined as R = 7500. An H2O volcanic gas plume was modeled using a Johnson unbounded distribution, with a maximum value of volume mixing ratio (vmr) at a chosen altitude and a slow decrease towards lower altitudes. The profile was defined as a perturbation of the VIRA nominal H2O profile (~ 30 ppm). with a peak vmr in the range 10-70 ppm and a peak altitude in the range 10-58 km. For each plume, the total integrated column density was conserved, defined as a scaler of the VIRA value, N(total)(H2O) ~ 13.23 kg m-2. An H2O plume at Z = 30 km with a 10 ppm peak increase results in a radiance difference of ~ 10% at 4150 cm-1. Ground-based observations and future space missions, such as iSHELL/IRTF and EnVision&amp;#8217;s VenSpec-H spectrograph [11], respectively, should have the high-spectral resolution and sensitivity required to detect such H2O variations due to a possible volcanic eruption event. Spectral Retrievals of iSHELL/IRTF spectraOn this framework, we are currently investigating the sensitivity of iSHELL/IRTF to retrieve the abundance of H2O and its temporal and latitudinal variability using the near-infrared spectral window at 1.74 &amp;#181;m (20-30 km) and 2.3 &amp;#181;m (30-45 km) [4]. The retrieval is ongoing with the ASIMUT tool (Vandaele+2006) [12].We performed 6 hours of observations, in February 2nd-3rd 2024, of Venus dayside and nightside using the K3 (2.26-2.55 &amp;#181;m) and H3 filters (1.64-1.82 &amp;#181;m) on the iSHELL/IRTF instrument. The slit width used was 0.375&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; x 5&amp;#8217;&amp;#8217; (R ~ 75 000) and it was positioned parallel to the axis of rotation. iSHELL is a cross-dispersed high-spectral resolution 1.1-5.3 &amp;#181;m echelle spectrograph (R ~ 80 000), located in Maunakea, Hawaii [13]. Wavelength calibration, flat fielding, dark correction and sky subtraction were performed using the Spextool data reduction software [14, 15].The dayside straylight contribution on the nightside, in order 306, was removed by scaling of the dayside spectra with a scaler computed as the nightside/dayside ratio, in order 295 (1.764-1.771 &amp;#181;m), where we modeled expected counts ~ 0.We identified several CO2 absorption lines in order 306 (1.702&amp;#8211;1.709 &amp;#181;m) and 305 (1.708-1.714 &amp;#181;m) and some hints of H2O and HCl absorption lines in order 300 (1.735-1.742 &amp;#181;m). The absolute flux calibration and retrieval of the H2O and HCl column densities are currently ongoing, using ASIMUT [12].References. (1) Gilmore et al. 2023, Space Sci Rev.

      <title>Visible and near-IR spectroscopic characterization of different dynamical classes of comets</title>

                Linking the taxonomic classification of comets with their dynamic classification is somehow still debated. Comets are historically distinguished in: typical and carbon-depleted based on A&amp;#8217;Hearn et al. (1985) work. Fink (2009) has further distinguished three other types of comets: Tempel 1 type, Giacobini-Zimmer type and the unusual Yanaka object.However, recent Solar System formation models (Brasser and Morbidelli 2013) indicate that comets are derived from the same parent population, i.e. the primordial trans-neptunian disc, before being scattered in the two main reservoirs of Oort Cloud and Scattered disk. This might suggest that the observed differences are evolutionary rather than primordial.&amp;#160;Cometary outgassing is dependent on the activity, that is, the abundance of various species of volatiles subliming from the nucleus varies with heliocentric distances and this significantly influences our classification and deserves better understanding.&amp;#160;Long Period Comets (LPCs) have been found to be already active very far away from the Sun, as far as 26 AU (Jewitt et al. 2019; Hui et al. 2018; Hui et al. 2019) and data analysis suggests that their activity must have started as far as 35 AU (Jewitt et al. 2021). At those heliocentric distances, the temperatures are too cold to allow water ice to sublimate. Despite other mechanisms are at study, the sublimation of supervolatile ices like CO2 and CO, which are among the most abundant ices in comets after water (e.g. Bockel&amp;#233;e-Morvan et al. 2017), is believed to be responsible for this distant activity (e.g. Fulle et al. 2020A; Fulle et al. 2020B; Bodewits et al. 2015; Ootsubo et al. 2012).&amp;#160;However a full understanding of the processes driving the cometary activity from far away from the Sun to the perihelion distance is still to be fully understood and the subtle differences among individual comets often seem to prevail with respect to a common pathway. Therefore, given the small statistics available, each individual addition is going to be very helpful and valuable to build a comprehensive insight of these processes.Here we present visible and near-IR spectroscopic characterization of a sample of more than 10 comets of different dynamical classes (JFC, Halley, Oort cloud) observed at various heliocentric distances (from 1 to 6 AU) using TNG with Dolores and NICS instruments covering the spectral ranges from 300 to 2500 nm.Preliminary reduction indicates a large variety of behaviors from very faint and inactive objects to typically CN-dominated objects to peculiar objects such as C/2016 R2.C/2016 R2 has been shown by several authors (e.g. Cochran &amp;amp; MacKay 2018; Opitom et al. 2019) to be a quite unique water-poor object rich in CO+/N2+. However, only recently an updated fluorescence emission model of CO+ has been published (Bromley et al., 2024).Additionally, modern calculations seem to suggest that such N2-rich comets might nevertheless be more common than we expected (Anderson et al. 2023) and could also be the key to understand the long-dated problem of the N2-depletion of comets with respect to the protosolar nebula.We present additional observations of this peculiar comet and other more typical comets that will be used to further constrain the models of the emission mechanisms and to obtain a better understanding of cometary composition and evolution.&amp;#160;ReferencesA&amp;#8217;Hearn, M. et al. 1985.

      <title>Exploring the seasonal variability at Louth crater ice mound with orbital colour imaging&amp;amp;#160;</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2024-611</link>

                Introduction : Martian H2O, CO2 and dust cycles are key processes in modern climate dynamics. The polar caps [1], as well as their icy outliers (that can take the form of convex-shaped ice mounds inside deep craters) are the current, major, exposed volatiles reservoirs. Unanswered questions remain about the mass balance of the caps. Concerning outliers, such as the ice domes of Louth and Korolev craters[2,3], the prevailing hypothesis suggests a build up by atmospheric deposition [4]. If accurate, these icy mounds could record past climate&amp;#160; conditions while still responding to present-day Martian climate change because of their southerly location [5].&amp;#160; They therefore offer unique opportunities to study volatiles dynamics, with different boundary conditions than those of the north or south caps.Research question : Our study takes advantage of the Exomars Trace Gas Orbiter &amp;#8211; Colour and Stereo Surface Imaging System&amp;#160; (CaSSIS) [6] colour imaging capabilities to evaluate pluri-annual ice changes, especially water frost and dust coverage at Louth and Korolev craters ice mounds. Those changes can serve as a proxy of local dynamics, which can reveal important information about ice and dust cycles.General methods:CaSSIS is the high-resolution stereoscopic camera of ESA&amp;#8217;s ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO). It possesses 4 broad band filters across the visible range : BLU (497nm), PAN (677nm), RED (835nm) and NIR (940nm). The orbit of TGO being non-Sun-synchronous, it allows us to acquire images of the same region of interest at different seasons and local times, at 4.6 m/pixel with high a&amp;#160; signal-to-noise ratio, and therefore allows to monitor diurnal phenomena until 74&amp;#176;N. The first step of the study consists of a morphological and spectral analysis of 25 Louth crater images, that cover MY34 to MY37.Visible reflectance features of water ice include an average high reflectance, relatively constant over the VIS range, as well as asymmetric overtone absorption bands at 800nm, 840nm, and 1030nm. In CaSSIS colors, the strongest signature of water ice is the reduction of the strong visible red slope of the dust. It has been demonstrated experimentally that CaSSIS color criteria can help differentiate&amp;#160; between different types of ice and dust mixings [7].&amp;#160;Observational results&amp;#160; :&amp;#160;In accordance with previous studies, [5,8], Louth ice mound appears generally homogeneous, with little to no significant spatial variations in its global albedo and colour. This is not the case in two particular observations, taken on 15.02.2022, and on 28.03.2022, respectively. A dark pattern appeared and displayed changes in the eastern direction (in Fig.1, the red circle shows the area of change).&amp;#160;Fig.1 : Two CaSSIS images (MY36_018836_078 and MY36_018951_106) of Louth crater,&amp;#160;taken in early martian autumn. The two images are NIR/PAN/BLU composites.&amp;#160;We searched for reports of similar events in the literature, and only found one study [9] reporting an &amp;#8216;unexplained dark patterning evolution&amp;#8217; in MRO - CTX images. We found other occurrences of dark patterns in MRO - HiRISE [10], in 2010, 2022, and 2023. Fig. 2 displays two examples of observations, both with HiRISE and CTX, in 2022 and 2023.Fig.2: Two occurrences of dark patterns in 2022 (A) and 2023 (B)The CTX observation shown in Fig.2 A was taken 14 days before the CaSSIS image MY36_018836_078 shown in Fig 1. A notable&amp;#160; eastward progression can be distinguished.Each occurrence is different in shape, shows&amp;#160; strong seasonality (appears at the end of summer, evolves through the autumn equinox), as well as rapid evolution (~tens of Martian days). The dark patterns disappear during each wintertime, showing a white &amp;#160;mound each following spring. This indicates that the mechanism that produces these patterns is related to seasonal effects.Preliminary spectral measurements of the ice in CaSSIS images show that the signal is largely dominated by the dust signature. We hypothesize that the dark marks could be caused by either deposition from the adjacent dune field, or local sublimation events.What&amp;#8217;s next ? &amp;#160;While continuing on spectral analysis with CaSSIS, we would like to explore the NOMAD [11] dataset to search if outliers in atmospheric water vapor content are correlated with the dark patterns occurrences. A &amp;#8216;cloud&amp;#8217; can be seen in the MY36_018951_106 observation displayed in Fig.1. We do not know if this is linked to the formation of the North Polar Hood, or to the event itself. Thirdly, we will make use of the Mars Climate Database [12] to explore the temperature and relative humidity fields around Louth. Lastly, we will perform a similar study on Korolev crater. It is less clear than in Louth, but some structures appearing in early autumn resemble the ones that have been described here.Acknowledgments:This work has been developed in the framework of the National Center for Competence in Research PlanetS funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF).CaSSIS is a project of the University of Bern and funded through the Swiss Space Office via ESA's PRODEX programme.
