      <title>Strategies for Improving Product Selectivity in Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction Using Copper&#8208;Based Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202410186</link>

                Abstract As an effective approach to converting carbon oxide (CO 2 ) into value&#8208;added carbonaceous products, the electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (ECO 2 RR) has shown considerable potential for carbon neutrality, addressing global pollution and climate issues. Copper (Cu)&#8208;based electrocatalysts (CuECs) are acknowledged as important candidates for the ECO 2 RR of multi&#8208;carbon products. Nevertheless, the complicated electron transfer and multiple competitive pathways in the multi&#8208;carbon production process raise challenges of product selectivity. While achieving high current density and structural stability, improving the product selectivity of CuECs has become crucial to their practical applications. Herein, an overview of the fundamental thermodynamic and kinetic principles of ECO 2 RR are presented. Then, the typical strategies are summarized for increasing CuEC selectivity for the formation of multi&#8208;carbon products from CO 2 , including morphological control, component design, defect design, and interface design. The catalyst design, catalytic performance, and reaction mechanisms involved in these strategies are reviewed. Finally, the major challenges and future prospects for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts in ECO 2 RR are discussed.</description>

                Compared with the large number of publications devoted to the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysed by polyoxometalates (POMs), the electrocatalysis of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CDRR) by these molecular catalysts has been only marginally explored. At first glance, this may seem surprising in view of their remarkable electron transfer properties which can be finely tuned by molecular engineering to fit the different proton-assisted multielectron reduction potentials for CO 2 . The possible combination of CO 2 with POMs in the form of coordination complexes appears, however, to be a promising route to develop POM-based electrocatalytic assemblies able to selectively drive CDRR. In this chapter, we provide an up-to-date description of more or less promising examples dealing with CDRR electrocatalysis by POMs in homogeneous (POMs dissolved in the electrolyte solution) and supported (POMs-modified (photo)electrodes) phases. This shows that promoting CDRR electrocatalysis by POMs with excellent performance metrics (efficiency, selectivity and stability) represents a current challenge. As a representative example, a POM-modified electrode that delivers high electrocatalytic current density (&gt;10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and is highly selective for CDRR has yet to be discovered.</description>

      <title>Spatial Structure of Electron Interactions in High&#8208;entropy Oxide Nanoparticles for Active Electrocatalysis of Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>

                Abstract High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) exhibit distinctive catalytic properties owing to their diverse elemental compositions, garnering considerable attention across various applications. However, the preparation of HEO nanoparticles with different spatial structures remains challenging due to their inherent structural instability. Herein, ultrasmall high&#8208;entropy oxide nanoparticles (less than 5 nm) with different spatial structures are synthesized on carbon supports via the rapid thermal shock treatment. The low&#8208;symmetry HEO, BiSbInCdSn&#8208;O 4 , demonstrates exceptional performance for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reaction (eCO 2 RR), including a lower overpotential, high Faraday efficiency across a wide electrochemical range (&#8722;0.3 to &#8722;1.6 V), and sustained stability for over100 h. In the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, BiSbInCdSn&#8208;O 4 achieves a current density of 350 mA cm &#8722;2 while maintaining good stability for 24 h. Both experimental observations and theoretical calculations reveal that the electron donor&#8211;acceptor interactions between bismuth and indium sites in BiSbInCdSn&#8208;O 4 enable the electron delocalization to facilitate the efficient adsorption of CO 2 and hydrogenation reactions. Thus, the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step is reduced to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability. This study elucidates that the spatial structure of metal sites in HEOs is able to regulate CO 2 adsorption status for eCO 2 RR, paving the way for the rational design of efficient HEO catalysts.</description>

      <title>Metal-Organic Frameworks-Based Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.62051/8w4yjg12</link>
      <description>Qian Zhang, Transactions on Materials Biotechnology and Life Sciences. 4(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402070198

                Given the increasing emphasis on carbon dioxide (CO2), diverse approaches have been developed and then used to address the issue. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have shown promise in catalyzing the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Different types of MOFs have investigated, including Cu-MOFs, Ce-MOFs, and hybrid composites, in order to enhance the catalytic selectivity, activity, and stability of electrocatalysts. MOFs possess distinct structural characteristics such as a large surface area, adjustable pore architectures, and numerous active sites, which provide effective adsorption, activation, and subsequent electrochemical reduction of CO2. The inclusion of metal centres, such as copper, silver, and cobalt, in MOFs has shown a strong preference for valuable chemical products, such as ethylene, formate, methane, and acetic acid. Incorporating MOFs with carbon-based electrodes or photosensitizers has significantly improved the catalytic efficiency and the speed at which charge is transferred in CO2 electroreduction processes. Nevertheless, there are still obstacles to overcome, such as the need to optimize the composition of catalysts, manage particle size, and provide scalability for use in industrial applications. Further study is necessary to expand the range of electrochemical techniques and reaction conditions, enhance the longevity of catalysts, and explore the potential of utilizing these types of catalysts for the specific conversion of CO2 into other valuable liquid fuels.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence-Driven Optimization of Ready-Mix Concrete for Enhanced Strength, Cost Efficiency, and Carbon Dioxide Emission Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4817801/v1</link>
      <description>Iman Faridmehr, Meysam Azarsa, Iman Varjavand, Kiyanets Aleksandr Valerievich, Research Square (Research Square). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402073679

                Abstract This study builds upon the evolving landscape of sustainable construction practices, where optimizing ready-mix concrete for strength, cost-efficiency, and reduced CO2 emissions is crucial in aligning with global environmental sustainability targets. Through an extensive analysis of diverse input parameters, including water-cement ratio, aggregate characteristics, additives, and their interactions with critical output parameters, this research has unveiled a substantial dependence on concrete performance, cost-efficiency, and environmental impact on cement selection and proportioning. This research emphasizes the pivotal role of cement in determining both the cost and CO2 emissions of concrete production, highlighting a notable positive correlation between cement content and compressive strength (R2 = 0.4946), and an even more pronounced correlation with CO2 emissions (R2 = 0.9529). This underlines the importance of optimizing cement use for balanced performance. Furthermore, the study reveals that while admixtures play a limited role in enhancing compressive strength (R2 = 0.0426), their impact on other concrete properties like workability and durability is significant. The optimization of concrete components, including a strategic reduction in admixture use, can lead to considerable cost and CO2 emission reductions, exemplified by a 5% cost decrease and a 7% drop in emissions with a 20% admixture reduction. Overall, these findings highlight the transformative impact of AI in concrete mix design, paving the way for more sustainable construction methods and contributing to global efforts to reduce the infrastructure sector's carbon footprint.</description>

      <title>Carbonated Water for Acceleration of Oil Production, Reduction of Water Production and Improvement of CO2-Storage Capacity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/220678-ms</link>
      <description>Ingebret Fjelde, Aruoture Voke Omekeh, No host. 125(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402144798

                Carbon Dioxide (CO2) capture, storage and its utilization can be used to decrease Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (Hong 2022). Alteration of the wettability of oil reservoirs has the potential to improve the oil recovery (Sheng, 2010). Wettability is defined the tendency of a fluid to adhere to a solid surface in the presence of other immiscible fluids (Craig, 1971). In multiphase flow in oil reservoirs, wettability is important for phase distribution and flow properties. In fractured reservoirs, wettability alteration will improve the spontaneous imbibition of water and thereby improve the oil recovery (Sheng, 2010; Fjelde and Asen, 2009). In spontaneous imbibition experiments, carbonated water (CW, water saturated with CO2) at oil reservoir conditions has been found to improve the spontaneous imbibition of water in fractured chalk models and improve the oil production (Fjelde et al., 2011). Sandstone rocks can also contain carbonate minerals (e.g. Pan et al., 2016). In addition, clay minerals in sandstone rocks are often more oil-wet than the other non-carbonate minerals. The surface area of clay minerals can be high in sandstone rocks, and these surfaces are very important for the wettability on core scale and reservoir scale. The flow properties in oil reservoirs depends on the saturation functions (relative permeability and capillary pressure) (Dake, 1978). Mineral composition and mineral distribution will together with the fluid compositions and conditions (temperature, pressure) determine these functions. Alteration of wettability for non-fractured oil reservoirs to more water-wet has also the potential to accelerate the oil production due to improvement of the relative permeability of oil (Collins and Melrose, 1983; Clementz 1976; 1977; 1982; Lager et al., 2007). Alteration of the wettability to more water-wet may have the potential to reduce the mobility ratio and thereby improve the volumetric sweep of the reservoir. The water production will be less at more water-wet conditions, because the relative permeability of water is low and higher volumetric sweep efficiency will the delay the water breakthrough. Alteration of wettability to more water-wet will therefore reduce the water production. Increase in relative permeability for oil and decrease in the relative permeability for water will give a shorter production period. Shorter production period and less water production will also reduce the environmental impact. Surface Complexation Modeling (SCM) with the geochemistry solver, PHREEQC has been used to estimate the wettability preferences of the minerals and rocks (Mehdiyev et al. 2022). The wettability preferences were estimated by calculating Bond Products defined as the product of the mole fraction of oppositely charged oil and mineral surfaces. It was shown that the SCM technique can predict the tendency for wettability alteration of the individual minerals and reservoir rocks during injection of CW using the different rock, brine and Stock Tank Oil (STO) compositions.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Optimization of Building Design Parameters for Cost Reduction and CO2 Emission Control Using Four Different Algorithms</title>

      <description>Ahmet Serhan Canbolat, Emre &#304;sa Albak, Applied Sciences. 14(17)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402050782

                Thermal insulation applications on the exterior facades of buildings have been the subject of numerous studies from the past to the present. Some of these studies focus on the cost reduction effect of insulation, while others emphasize its ecological benefits. In this study, multi-objective optimization, the objectives of which are minimum cost and minimum CO2 emission, has been carried out with the NSGA-II method. In emission calculations, in addition to fuel-related emissions, the carbon footprint of all materials comprising the wall has also been included. The multi-objective optimization study examined four design variables: wall thickness, wall material (light concrete, reinforced concrete, and brick), insulation material (expanded polystyrene, extruded polystyrene, mineral wool, and polyurethane foam), and heating source (natural gas, electricity, fuel oil). Analyses have been carried out for four cities (Osmaniye, Bursa, Isparta, and Erzurum), which are located in different climatic regions, and considering solar radiation effects. An existing building has been taken as the base case scenario, and the study has determined the improvements in the total cost and the amount of CO2 released into the environment when the appropriate insulation material, insulation thickness, wall material, and heating source identified in the multi-objective optimization study have been used. At the cost-oriented optimum point in the study, the most suitable insulation material was found to be expanded polystyrene, the most suitable wall material was brick, and the most suitable heating source was natural gas. In the CO2-oriented optimum, in contrast to the cost-oriented approach, optimal results have been obtained when light concrete was selected as the wall material.</description>

                Developing a function-integrated catalyst from earth-abundant elements, capable of efficient light harvesting and electron transfer, is crucial for enhancing the efficacy of CO2 transformation, a critical step in environmental cleanup and advancing clean energy prospects. Traditional approaches relying on external photosensitizers, comprising of 4d/5d metal complexes, often face challenges in intermolecular electron transfer, and attachment of photosensitizing arms to the catalyst increases dependency on intramolecular electron transfer kinetics, underscoring the need for a more integrated solution. We report a new Cu(II) complex, K[CuNDPA] (1[K(18-crown-6)]), bearing a dipyrrin amide-based trianionic tetradentate ligand, NDPA (H3L), which is capable of harnessing light energy, despite having a paramagnetic Cu(II) center, without any external photosensitizer and photocatalytically reducing CO2 to CO in acetonitrile: water (19:1 v/v) with a TON as high as 1132, a TOF of 566 h-1 and a selectivity of 99%. This complex also shows hemilability in the presence of water, which not only plays a role in a proton relay mechanism but also helps stabilize a crucial Cu(I)-NDPA intermediate. The hemilability was justified by the formation of N3O (2) and N2O2 (3) coordinated congeners of the N4 bound complex 1. The overall mechanism was further investigated via spectroscopic techniques like EPR, UV-vis, and Spectroelectrochemistry, culminating in the justification of a single electron-reduced Cu(I)NDPA species as a proposed intermediate. In the next step, the binding of CO2 to Cu(I) complex and subsequent electron transfer to form Cu(II)-CO2&#8226;&#8254; was indirectly probed by a radical trapping experiment via the addition of p-methoxy-2,6-ditertbutylphenol that led to the formation of a phenoxyl radical. This work opens new strategies for designing earth-abundant robust molecular catalysts that can function as photocatalysts without the aid of any external photosensitizers.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Performance Indices of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Ethylene Based on Prospective Life Cycle Assessment for Negative Emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202401409</link>

                To mitigate global warming to the most ambitious targets, it is necessary to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and reduce fossil fuels use. The electrochemical conversion of CO2 to ethylene (C2H4) as a basic chemical is a promising technology that meets both requirements; however, its life cycle CO2 emissions remain inconclusive because of varying assumptions in the performance indices. This study aimed to set benchmarks for the four most sensitive indices to achieve -0.5 t-CO2/t-C2H4 by calculating net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through a prospective life cycle assessment of a model system including CO2 capture, CO2 enrichment, electrochemical conversion, CO2 recycling, and cryogenic separation. As a result, the electrochemical conversion process was the hotspot of life cycle emissions, and representative benchmarks were determined as follows: cell voltage, 3.5 V; C2H4 Faraday efficiency, 70%; conversion rate, 20%; and electrochemical CO2 recycling energy, 2.2 GJ/t-CO2. The gaps between the benchmarks and current top data of cell voltage and Faraday efficiency were &lt;10%, and suppressing the performance degradation for up to one year was found to be a critical requirement. These results can direct research towards the development of a year-round stable system, rather than further improving the performance indices.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Interface&#8208;Performance Relationships in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction through Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Assembly of Nanocrystal&#8208;on&#8208;Nanowire Superstructures</title>

                Fine-tuning the interfacial sites within heterogeneous catalysts is pivotal for unravelling the intricate structure-property relationship and optimizing their catalytic performance. Herein, a simple and versatile mixed-dimensional assembly approach is proposed to create nanocrystal-on-nanowire superstructures with precisely adjustable numbers of biphasic interfaces. This method leverages an efficient self-assembly process in which colloidal nanocrystals spontaneously organize onto Ag nanowires, driven by the solvophobic effect. Importantly, varying the ratio of the two components during assembly allows for accurate control over both the quantity and contact perimeter of biphasic interfaces. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, a series of Au-on-Ag superstructures with varying numbers of Au/Ag interfaces are constructed and employed as electrocatalysts for electrochemical CO2-to-CO conversion. Experimental results reveal a logarithmic linear relationship between catalytic activity and the number of Au/Ag interfaces per unit mass of Au-on-Ag superstructures. This work presents a straightforward approach for precise interface engineering, paving the way for systematic exploration of interface-dependent catalytic behaviors in heterogeneous catalysts.</description>

      <title>Why CO2 Emissions Reductions Does Not Bring Climate Coldening Anymore &#8211; the Effect of Thermally Efficient Motors &#8211; a Study Confirmed by AI</title>

                Thermal motor emissions have grown cold and colder over time thanks to the betterment of the yield of motors. This contributes to an inversion of behaviour of CO2, since photosynthesis is endothermic, absorbs heat together with it. New CO2 emissions are coldening the climate where thermal motor efficiency is good. This is confirmed with AI support and shown to explain the late snows this Spring in Europe, as well as the &#8220;La Ni&#241;a&#8221; trend that has been announced. Global warming can be totally reduced and reversed with a consistent pattern of smart CO2 emissions, without the heat associated, thanks to new thermally efficient motors.</description>

      <title>BIO-NANOTECHNOLOGY-BASED SOLUTIONS FOR SUSTAINABLE WASTE MANAGEMENT AND POLLUTION</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54112/bcsrj.v2024i1.1047</link>
      <description>UB KAMAL, Samia Sharmin, Muhammad Rizwan, ZA CHOUDHARY, Najma Latif, A SHAMAS, Adane Sirage Ali, Biological and Clinical Sciences Research Journal. 2024(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401948581

                Waste management and pollution reduction are critical global challenges that demand innovative and sustainable solutions. Traditional methods often fall short in terms of efficiency and environmental impact. Biological nanotechnology, particularly the use of biosurfactants and nanoenzymes, offers promising alternatives for addressing environmental pollutants such as hydrocarbons, textile dyes, and heavy metals. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of bio-nanotechnology-based solutions, specifically biosurfactants and nanoenzymes, in waste management and pollution reduction, focusing on sustainability and environmental impact. Methods: A quantitative research approach was employed to assess the efficacy of bio-nanotechnology in waste treatment and pollution reduction. Laboratory experiments were conducted to explore the degradation capacity of biosurfactants and nanoenzymes on various pollutants. The study also involved a survey of 167 industry professionals to evaluate the potential of bio-nanotechnology in enhancing waste treatment efficiency and environmental sustainability. Data on pollutant elimination efficacy, degradation rates, soil health, metal contaminant levels, and CO2 emissions were collected. Statistical analysis was performed to compare the outcomes of nano-bioremediation with traditional methods. Results: The laboratory experiments demonstrated a high treatment capacity, with pollutant elimination efficacy exceeding 86% and degradation rates significantly faster than conventional treatments. The survey results indicated that bio-nanotechnology could enhance waste treatment efficiency and environmental friendliness by 20-40%. Nano-bioremediation led to a 23% improvement in soil health, a 32% reduction in metal contaminants, and a 14-19% decrease in CO2 emissions from waste processing compared to conventional methods. Conclusion: The study's findings suggest that bio-nanotechnology presents a novel, sustainable solution for waste management and pollution reduction. The significant improvements in pollutant elimination, soil health, and reduction of metal contaminants and CO2 emissions highlight the potential of this approach to address global environmental challenges more effectively than traditional methods. Further research and development are recommended to optimize and scale up these technologies for broader application.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Hypercapnia Effects in Experimental Models with or without Acute Lung Injury: A Scoping Review</title>

                Background: Ventilatory strategies in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients aim to mitigate the risk of acute lung injury (ALI). However, prolonged utilization of these strategies may precipitate alveolar carbon dioxide elevation and pH reduction. This scoping review endeavors to present extant knowledge concerning hypercapnia effects in experimental models, with or without ALI, specifically focusing on delineating the immunologically mediated pulmonary tissue damage; Methods: A systematic exploration encompassing PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Reviews, and Scielo databases was undertaken. Articles published between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2022, were screened for their elucidation of hypercapnia&amp;#039;s immunological impact on lung tissue, utilizing experimental or biological models, irrespective of ALI presence; Results: Following duplicate removal and predefined criteria filtering, 30 pertinent articles scrutinizing hypercapnia&amp;#039;s influence on pulmonary epithelium were identified. It was observed that hypercapnia induces perturbations in innate immune response gene transcription, mediated via Nuclear Factor-kappa B attenuation. Furthermore, a compromised innate immune response against injurious agents was noted. Concurrently, disruption and subsequent resealing of alveolar epithelial cells were evidenced, primarily through Na/K-ATPase endocytosis, impeding fluid reabsorption at the alveolar epithelium level; Conclusions: In experimental settings, with or without ALI, hypercapnia&amp;#039;s immunomediated mechanisms exacerbate innate immune system impairment and disrupt the respiratory epithelium&amp;#039;s repair and healing processes.</description>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) provides the protons for many electrocatalytic power-to-X processes, such as the production of green hydrogen from water or methanol from CO2. Iridium oxo-hydroxides (IOHs) are outstanding catalysts for this reaction because they strike a unique balance between activity and stability in acidic electrolytes. Within IOHs, this balance varies with atomic structure. While amorphous IOHs perform best, they are least stable. The opposite is true for their crystalline counterparts. These rules-of-thumb are used to reduce the loading of scarce IOH catalysts and retain performance. However, it is not fully understood how activity and stability are related on the atomic level, hampering rational design. Herein, we provide simple design-rules (Figure 12) derived from literature and various IOHs within this study. We chose crystalline IrOOH nanosheets as our lead material because they provide excellent catalyst utilization and a predictable structure. We found that nanosheets combine the chemical stability of crystalline IOHs with the activity amorphous IOHs. Their dense bonding network of pyramidal trivalent oxygens (&#956;3&#8710;&#8211;O) provides structural integrity, while allowing reversible reduction to an electronically gapped state that diminishes the destructive effect of reductive potentials. The reactivity originates from coordinative unsaturated edge sites with radical character, i.e. &#956;1&#8211;O oxyls. By comparing to other IOHs and literature, we generalized our findings and synthesized a set of simple rules that allow prediction of stability and reactivity of IOHs from atomistic models. We hope that these rules will inspire atomic design strategies for future OER catalysts.</description>

                In this work, we have prepared and characterized some gold compounds wearing a N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand as well as alkynyl derivatives with different substituents. The study of their electrochemical behavior reveals that these complexes show an irreversible wave at potentials ranging between &#8722;2.79 and &#8722;2.91 V, referenced to the ferrocenium/ferrocene pair. DFT calculations indicate that the reduction occurs mainly on the aryl-C&#8801;C fragment. The cyclic voltammetry experiments under CO2 atmosphere show an increase in the faradaic current of the reduction wave compared to the experiments under argon atmosphere, indicating a possible catalytic activity towards the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR).</description>

      <title>Spatial distributed characteristics of carbon dioxide emissions based on fossil energy consumption and their driving factors at provincial scale in China</title>

                The spatial distribution characteristics of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of coal, crude oil and natural gas in China during 2019 were revealed through Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) method. Then spatial differences of the impacts of socio-economic factors on CO2 emissions were discussed by using geographical weighted regression (GWR) model. Furthermore, the relationship between urbanization and CO2 emissions was explored by combing the center of gravity model with coupling coordination development degree model. The findings demonstrate that the high spatial agglomeration effect and risk areas of coal-based CO2 emissions are concentrated in the northern region (the maximum emissions up to 1005.09 Mt), and the same type of natural gas-based CO2 emissions are distributed in the central region, while the low spatial agglomeration effect and risk areas of crude oil-based CO2 emissions are mainly in the western region. Under the positive impact from energy intensity (average influence coefficient is 1.59), CO2 emissions show a good coupling trend with economic urbanization, but present a spatial differentiation of unbalanced western and coordinated eastern regions with population urbanization. This study enriches the content of energy-based carbon emissions from geographic and management disciplines, also gives scientific foundation for differential formulation of carbon emission reduction policies.</description>

      <title>Covalent Organic Framework Stabilized Single CoN4Cl2 Site Boosts Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction into Tunable Syngas</title>

                Solar carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction provides an attractive alternative to producing sustainable chemicals and fuel. However, the construction of a highly active photocatalyst was challenging because of the rapid charge recombination and sluggish surface CO2 reduction. Herein, a unique Co&#8208;N4Cl2 single site was fabricated by loading Co species into the 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine and triazine&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (COF) for CO2 conversion into syngas under visible light irradiation. The resulting champion catalyst TPy&#8208;COF&#8208;Co enabled a record&#8208;high CO production rate of 426 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, associated with the unprecedented turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of 2095 and 1607 h&#8722;1, respectively. The catalyst also exhibited favorable recycling performance and widely adjustable syngas production (CO/H2 ratio: 1.8:1&#8208;1:16). A systematical investigation including operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS), and theoretical calculation indicated that the triazine&#8208;based COF framework promoted the charge transfer towards the single Co&#8208;N4Cl2 sites that greatly promoted the CO2 activation by lowering the energy barrier of *COOH generation, facilitating the CO2 transformation. This work highlights the great potential of the molecular regulation of COF&#8208;derived single&#8208;atom catalysts to boost CO2 photoreduction efficiency.</description>

                Solar carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction provides an attractive alternative to producing sustainable chemicals and fuel. However, the construction of a highly active photocatalyst was challenging because of the rapid charge recombination and sluggish surface CO2 reduction. Herein, a unique Co&#8208;N4Cl2 single site was fabricated by loading Co species into the 2,2'&#8208;bipyridine and triazine&#8208;containing covalent organic framework (COF) for CO2 conversion into syngas under visible light irradiation. The resulting champion catalyst TPy&#8208;COF&#8208;Co enabled a record&#8208;high CO production rate of 426 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, associated with the unprecedented turnover number (TON) and turnover frequency (TOF) of 2095 and 1607 h&#8722;1, respectively. The catalyst also exhibited favorable recycling performance and widely adjustable syngas production (CO/H2 ratio: 1.8:1&#8208;1:16). A systematical investigation including operando synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflection surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS), and theoretical calculation indicated that the triazine&#8208;based COF framework promoted the charge transfer towards the single Co&#8208;N4Cl2 sites that greatly promoted the CO2 activation by lowering the energy barrier of *COOH generation, facilitating the CO2 transformation. This work highlights the great potential of the molecular regulation of COF&#8208;derived single&#8208;atom catalysts to boost CO2 photoreduction efficiency.</description>

                The notable reduction in forest coverage and usage of nonrenewable energy resources have resulted in accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, thus contributing to the worsening of the phenomenon commonly referred to as global warming. This research undertook an investigation into the efficacy of a distinct absorbent in eliminating CO2 from the air within a spouted bed reactor. By utilizing the Taguchi methodology, the study examined the capacity of sodium carbonate to eradicate CO2 from the atmosphere across a wide range of concentrations (600&#8211;1850 ppm), temperatures (55&#8211;90 &#176;C), and molar ratios of Na to C in the absorbent (ranging from 1 to 3). The results indicated that this absorbent effectively eliminated 86% of the initial CO2 at a reaction temperature of 55 &#176;C, a molar Na/C ratio of 1.4, and an initial concentration of 1280 ppm. Additionally, the examination of the solid composition postabsorption using X-ray diffraction revealed the formation of sodium bicarbonate during the absorption process. The novelty of this study resides in the introduction of a novel method for capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. Moreover, the viability of regenerating sodium carbonate by liberating CO2 from bicarbonate was also evaluated through thermogravimetric analysis.</description>

                The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) is one of the most promising ways to valorise CO2 as a source of carbon. The development of novel, efficient and scalable catalysts for CO2 electroreduction within electrolysers is still a big challenge. Here, we report the preparation of sustainable, efficient and stable gas diffusion electrodes utilizing Ag as catalyst for the CO2 electroreduction to CO. These cathodic materials are prepared by sputter deposition and subjected to post-deposition modification using dry, reactive processes. The catalyst is uniformly deposited as a thin layer on the porous structure of PTFE minimizing the amount of Ag required. This approach allows for fine tuning of the morphology, chemical composition and loading of Ag and their impact on the CO2RR. These electrodes have been evaluated for the CO2 electroreduction and for electrocatalytic studies in a flow reactor with gas-fed CO2. The optimized electrodes show high activity, with current densities &gt; 20 mA/cm2 at -1,18 V vs. RHE, and faradaic efficiency for CO &gt; 90 %. The stability was tested over periods up to 24 hours showing a significant impact of the post-deposition modification. Higher porosity, roughness and electrochemical surface area have been achieved after the modification. Noteworthy, our approach allows for outstanding performances using a minimal amount of metal, while using the processing advantages of sputtering as an industrial state-of-the-art, high-throughput, and roll-to-roll compatible technique. Moreover, this route enables the deposition of different metals and alloys of tailored composition for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction beyond CO.</description>

                Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) over Cu-based catalysts has emerged as a promising strategy for value-added artificial carbon cycling, addressing the current climate and energy challenges. However, the product selectivity and long-term stability of Cu-based catalysts are limited by their instability at constant potential. Recent advancements in pulsed techniques aim to overcome these limitations, enhancing the industrial feasibility of the CO2RR systems. This review critically examines recent research progress in pulsed CO2RR over Cu-based catalysts, offering a comprehensive synthesis of current findings. Key pulse parameters and characterization strategies are explored to uncover the mechanisms behind the enhanced CO2RR performance. The focus is on surface reconstruction, encompassing the regeneration and stabilization of the Cu oxidation states alongside morphological evolution, while also discussing microenvironment changes, including local CO2 concentration, local pH, and ionic arrangement. The intricate modulation mechanisms of pulse mode, potential, and duration on the CO2RR performance are elucidated, highlighting their interconnections. Finally, we identify the prevailing challenges and propose future directions for achieving environmentally friendly and economically viable artificial carbon cycling. By providing insightful perspectives on optimizing pulsed CO2RR, this review paves the way for developing more efficient and robust Cu-based catalytic systems.</description>

(1) Efforts on harnessing excess emitted CO2 back to the carbon cycle via chemical, electrochemical, and photochemical pathways have seen steady development to produce value-added chemicals for energy storage. (1,2) Among them, an environmentally benign electroreduction approach is the most promising one for valorization of CO2 as fuels and chemicals, albeit the fact that sluggish kinetics and lack of selectivity require the design of suitable catalysts. (3,4) Molecular electrocatalysts have well-defined active sites and accurately tailorable structures that allow mechanism-based performance optimization. Among them, several are based on easily available first-row transition metals to catalyze CO2 reduction (CO2RR) via a 2e&#8211;/2H+ mechanism to form CO and HCOOH. (5) Nevertheless, examples of molecular catalysts capable of reducing CO2 beyond 2e&#8211;/2H+ (e.g., multielectron products) are scarce. A key reason for that is the difficulty in controlling the binding affinity of the catalyst-bound CO intermediate, which often plays a pivotal role in the generation of multielectron/multiproton products. (5,6) Along with this, the complexity of the multielectron/multiproton pathways involving multiple intermediates provides a limited understanding of the reaction mechanism. (5,7) Herein, we would like to highlight several recently reported strategies that show promising CO2RR activity and selectivity toward products beyond 2e&#8211;/2H+, such as (i) immobilization of functionalized molecular catalysts over conductive supports, (ii) incorporation of intramolecular hydrogen-bonding groups proximal to the active site, and (iii) the use of light illumination during electrochemical CO2RR in molecular catalysts incorporated within porous hybrid platforms.Initially, Wang et al. reported one of the first examples of a molecular electrocatalyst reducing CO2 to value-added multielectron hydrocarbons. They immobilized a cobalt phthalocyanine catalyst (CoPc, Figure 1a) over multiwalled carbon-nanotubes (CoPc/MWCNTs) and used it as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst that, in aqueous solution, undergoes 6e&#8211;/6H+ CO2RR to generate CH3OH. (5) They first compared the catalytic performance of CNT-immobilized iron, cobalt, and nickel phthalocyanine (FePc, CoPc, and NiPc, respectively), as metal-to-CO binding energy, EB(CO), varies with different M&#8211;N4, spanning over a range of 1.2 eV and found that cobalt provides moderate CO binding. Therefore, among all three catalysts, only CoPc produced MeOH with a faradaic efficiency (FE) of up to 44% at &#8722;0.94 V vs RHE (CO and H2 being the major products for FePc and NiPc). Through scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis they have shown that CoPc has molecular level dispersion over the CNT, which is vital for MeOH formation. Otherwise, physical mixtures of CoPc and CNTs showed much less reactivity, despite having higher CoPc content. According to their observation, at lower overpotential, CO was the major CO2RR product, and thus, it was postulated that CO acts as a reactive intermediate toward MeOH formation. Indeed, when an electrocatalytic CO reduction reaction (CORR) using CoPc/MWCNT was performed, it produced MeOH with a FE of 28% at &#8722;0.77 V vs RHE. Overall, catalysis goes through a "domino" process where CO2 first reduces to CO, and then undergoes another 4e&#8211;/4H+ reduction to MeOH, and the potential-dependent steps of both CO2RR and CORR are very similar. Nonetheless, this catalytic system suffers from rather limited durability. Upon only 1 h of electrolysis, FECH3OH decreased by 18%, while after 4 h of electrolysis, MeOH formation became negligible. UV&#8211;visible spectra of the postelectrolysis CoPc molecule from the electrode revealed an undesired reduction of the Pc ligand, eventually leading to hydrogenation of the macrocycle. To avoid the reductive deactivation, Wang and co-workers introduced four electron-donating amino groups in the &#946; position of the CoPc moiety (Figure 1b, CoPc-NH2), which successfully lowered the overpotential and could sustain activity for a longer time with a maximum FECH3OH of 32%.Figure 1Figure 1.

Copyright 2023 Authors.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideAt about the same time, Robert et al. also used the CoPc catalyst and MWCNT mixture with a Nafion binder over carbon paper for the conversion of CO2 to MeOH. (8) Under heterogeneous conditions in 0.5 M KHCO3 solution (pH = 7.2), they obtained only 0.3% FECH3OH at &#8722;0.88 V vs RHE, which increased to 2% when they used CO as substrate instead of CO2. However, at pH 13, when CO was used as a substrate, the same CoPc/MWCNT system exhibited 14.3% FECH3OH at &#8722;0.68 V vs RHE, i.e., a 50-fold increase in selectivity at a 170 mV lower overpotential, along with a 10-fold increase in catalytic rate. Subsequent HPLC experiments showed that during CORR at pH 13, formaldehyde (HCHO) is formed. At alkaline pH, there is a chance of Cannizzaro reaction, i.e., a disproportionation of HCHO (aldehyde without &#945; hydrogens) to CH3OH and HCOO&#8211; causing an overestimation of CH3OH's FE determination. Knowing that, Robert and co-workers carefully evaluated these nonfaradaic CH3OH formations and concluded that their effect is negligible. In addition, a series of control experiments, along with Co K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of the CoPc before and after electrolysis proved that the observed reactivity was not due to the decomposition of CoPc into metallic Co nanoparticles, thus signifying the molecular nature of the catalyst.Lately, McCrory et al. further investigated the catalytic properties of the CoPc/MWCNT system using a gas-diffusion electrode (GDE) flow-cell. Compared to a conventional H-cell configuration, performing the electrocatalytic reaction in a CO2-fed GDE setup showed appreciably suppressed activity toward MeOH formation. The key explanation for these results lies at the higher CO2 binding affinity of CoPc compared to its affinity to bind CO, as quantitatively measured in this study. (6) The authors varied the partial current density of MeOH (product of CORR) at &#8722;0.70 V vs RHE as a function of the partial pressure of CO (PCO), which ultimately reached a plateau at PCO = 1. Thereafter, using a microkinetic analysis, the binding constant of CO to CoPc (KCO) was determined to be 3.0 atm&#8211;1. On the contrary, in the case of a CO2RR reaction with CoPc (where the major product is CO), extracted KCO2 was 11.1 atm&#8211;1. The high binding constant ratio of KCO2/KCO = 3.7, provides a thermodynamic explanation for the inefficient MeOH formation on CoPc/MwCNTs during CO2RR, where catalyst-bound CO is preferentially displaced by CO2 molecules before it can be further reduced. Thus, the authors suggested that researchers should look forward in the direction of controlling the local concentration of CO2 by construction of catalyst&#8211;polymer composites, or via applying modifications to the coordination environments of CoPc. These strategies will strengthen the CO binding, especially when using GDE flow-cells.As opposed to CoPc, in case of metal porphyrins, up until recently, reports of CO2 reduction into multielectron compounds were only available when conducted under photochemical conditions. (10,11) Lately, however, Dey and co-workers designed a distal superstructure in the molecular framework of iron porphyrins, and were able to stop the dissociation of CO from the metal-bound intermediate and simultaneously activated it for further reduction. In this work, an iron porphyrin having a distal basic pyridine residue was synthesized (FeL2, Figure 1C) and used as homogeneous electrocatalyst for CO reduction to CH4, with 93% FE. (2) Spectro-electrochemistry coupled FTIR (FTIR-SEC) was employed to understand the mechanism of the reaction with in situ detection of the metal&#8211;carbonyl species, using 12/13CO isotope sensitive absorption. In CO-saturated CH3CN containing 3% H2O, they identified an FeII&#8211;CO species being reduced to FeI&#8211;CO at applied potential of &#8722;1.75 V vs Fc/Fc+, followed by the reduction of FeI&#8211;CO to Fe0-CO at &#8722;2.35 V vs Fc/Fc+. Interestingly, while holding the potential at &#8722;2.35 V for a long period, an FeII&#8211;CHO adduct was detected, which then could be further reduced to CH4. In this case, pyridine mediated hydrogen-bonding between water molecules (i.e., proton source) and FeI&#8211;CO intermediate allows its stabilization, and activation for further reduction to CH4 (as evidenced by DFT calculation).In another attempt to achieve multielectron CO2 reduction using porphyrins, our group adopted a different approach, based on a photoassisted electrocatalysis pathway for multiproton/multielectron CO2RR. To do so, we have utilized photoactive Co-porphyrin (CoTCPP)-based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) films (Co-MOF-525). Under 1-sun light illumination (100 mW/cm2), the MOF film can sustain large quantities of long-lived oxidized charged carriers during photocathodic operation and performed a 8e&#8211;/8H+ reduction of CO2 to CH4 (in 80/20 (%v/v) CH3CN&#8211;H2O with a LiClO4 electrolyte). (9) Subsequent, photoassisted chronoamperometric measurements revealed that in the potential window of &#8722;0.39 to &#8722;0.64 V, CH4 and CO were produced during CO2RR, with a maximum FECH4 being 14% at &#8722;0.49 V, while FECO was only 2%. Yet, in the absence of light illumination, both products were formed in a very negligible amount. At more cathodic potentials, a hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) became more prominent and significantly suppressed CO2RR. Generally, CoITCPP is the CO2RR active state that binds CO2 and undergoes 2e&#8211;/2H+ reduction to CO. However, thin layer spectro-electrochemical measurements revealed a different mechanism that leads to the unexpected CH4 production. Under dark electrolysis conditions, spectro-electrochemistry analysis showed the formation of bands attributed to CoIITCPP and [CoIIITCPP]+, while measurements at more cathodic potentials showed the formation of a new band corresponding to CO2RR active species, [CoITCPP]&#8722;. Surprisingly, in photoassisted electrolysis conditions, the formation of a broad band at 460 nm was noticed, suggesting the existence of a higher oxidation form of the catalyst, namely, [CoIIITCPP]2+, which was the product of a porphyrin ring oxidation. Here, with an increase in the cathodic potential, the [CoIIITCPP]2+ band decreased in intensity, while the CoIITCPP and [CoIIITCPP]+ bands remained unchanged throughout the course of the reaction. In other words, in these conditions, MOF-525 maintains a high concentration of [CoIIITCPP]+ species (via photo-oxidative accumulation of holes), which is known to stabilize CO by preferentially binding with it, (12) a crucial step that allows its further reduction to CH4.To conclude, despite severe challenges posed in the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to multielectron products, successful reports of molecular catalysts capable of CO2RR beyond 2e&#8211;/2H+ have increased lately. The results highlighted herein could help pave the way toward (i) rational catalyst design, (ii) improved structure&#8211;function correlation studies, and (iii) identification of key mechanistic factors necessary to understand molecular catalyst operation both in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous configurations. Nevertheless, realizing the next-generation of molecular catalytic systems will have to involve new approaches for the stabilization of key reactive intermediates while developing means for their assembly onto porous functional supports that allows the incorporation of secondary-sphere interactions to stir the CO2RR path toward the desired products.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorsArnab Ghatak - Department of Chemistry and Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, 8410501, Israel; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3027-9359; Email: [email protected]Idan Hod - Department of Chemistry and Ilse Katz Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, 8410501, Israel; https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4837-8793; Email: [email protected]Author ContributionsThe manuscript was written through contribution of all the authors.

      <title>Synergistically Photocatalytic Conversion of Two Greenhouse Gases to Liquid&#8208;Phase Oxygenates under Anaerobic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/solr.202400522</link>
      <description>Haiting Lin, Anyi Chen, Tianren Liu, Wensheng Zhang, Xiyou Du, Junjie Feng, Jiajun Zeng, Yingying Fan, Dongxue Han, Li Niu, Solar RRL. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401975767

                Collaborative conversion of methane and carbon dioxide into sustainable chemicals is an appealing solution to simultaneously overcome both environmental problems and energy crisis. However, this reaction is limited to the preparation of syngas with the unfavorable feature for transportation and storage. Herein, liquid formaldehyde as product is fabricated by the collaborative conversion of methane and carbon dioxide using anatase phase titanium dioxide as photocatalyst. The productivity reaches 14.65 mmol g &#8722;1 with 88.32% selectivity. In situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, isotope testes, and theoretical calculation clarify that the photoexcited holes and electrons engage into methane oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction over anatase using surface hydroxyl species and oxygen vacancy as active sites, respectively. The consumption of surface hydroxyl species on methane oxidation promotes the oxygen vacancy formation for carbon dioxide adsorption, mutually the carbon dioxide provides the oxygen atom for surface hydroxyl species facilitating methane oxidation. The consumption of photoelectrons and photoholes on carbon dioxide reduction and methane oxidation balances the number of photogenerated carriers and ensures the catalytic system stability. In this work, the avenue is broadened toward the co&#8208;conversion of greenhouse gas into desirable chemical products in a sustainable way.</description>

      <title>Projections for the 2050 Scenario of the Mexican Electrical System</title>

      <description>Diocelina Toledo-V&#225;zquez, R.J. Romero, Gabriela Hern&#225;ndez-Luna, J. Cerezo, Mois&#233;s Montiel-Gonz&#225;lez, Energies. 17(17)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402052942

                Electricity is fundamental to modern societies and will become even more so as its use expands through different technologies and population growth. Power generation is currently the largest source of carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions globally, but it is also the sector that is leading the transition to net zero emissions through the rapid rise of renewables. The impacts of COVID-19 on the electricity sector led to a reduction in the demand for electricity, while at the same time, the current global energy crisis has placed the security and affordability of electricity at the top of the political agenda in many countries. In this way, the decrease in the demand for electricity, as well as its gradual recovery, makes it necessary to carry out energy planning that considers the adverse effects caused by global events with a high socioeconomic impact. In this article, the Low Emission Analysis Platform (LEAP) 2020 software has been used to determine the distribution of energy sources to 2050 for Mexico. The variables that lead to the possible profiles for 2050 are social, economic, and technological. The results correspond to a possible future based on official data from the National Electric System (SEN) of Mexico. The forecast for 2050 indicates that the electricity sector will have almost double the current installed capacity; however, emissions do not correspond to twice as much: they are practically 50% higher.</description>

                In order to protect our planet's climate, it is important to reduce humanity's carbon dioxide emissions significantly. The energy sector is one of the most polluting industries, but the rapid spread of renewable energy sources over the past 20 years can significantly contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. The study examined which energy sources are used to produce electricity in Hungary, and how the proportion of renewable energy has developed in recent years compared to more polluting energy production methods. There is a strong negative exponential relationship between the share of renewable energy and the carbon dioxide emissions of the energy sector, based on which the carbon dioxide emissions of the energy sector can be significantly reduced by increasing the share of renewable energy. A forecast was made for the renewable share based on past data and the revised state of the National Energy and Climate Plan in 2023, and a linear forecast was made for the energy sector's emissions. There is a strong exponential relationship between the data series. Both models examined in the study had strong explanatory power, but neither model supports the possibility of climate-neutral energy production by 2030.</description>

      <title>New discrete fractional accumulation Grey Gompertz model for predicting carbon dioxide emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1450354</link>

                Predicting carbon dioxide emissions is crucial for addressing climate change and achieving environmental sustainability. Accurate emission forecasts provide policymakers with a basis for evaluating the effectiveness of policies, facilitating the design and implementation of emission reduction strategies, and helping businesses adjust their operations to adapt to market changes. Various methods, such as statistical models, machine learning, and grey prediction models, have been widely used in carbon dioxide emission prediction. However, existing research often lacks comparative analysis with other forecasting techniques. This paper constructs a new Discrete Fractional Accumulation Grey Gompertz Model (DFAGGM(1,1) based on grey system theory and provides a detailed solution process. The Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) is used to find the hyperparameters in the model. By comparing it with five benchmark models, the effectiveness of DFAGGM(1,1) in predicting carbon dioxide emissions data for China and the United States is validated.</description>

      <title>Future Climate Change in the Thermosphere Under Varying Solar Activity Conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2024ja032659</link>
      <description>Matthew K. Brown, Hugh G. Lewis, A. J. Kavanagh, Ingrid Cnossen, Sean Elvidge, Journal of Geophysical Research Space Physics. 129(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402020150

                Abstract Increasing carbon dioxide concentrations in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere are increasing radiative cooling in the upper atmosphere, leading to thermospheric contraction and decreased neutral mass densities at fixed altitudes. Previous studies of the historic neutral density trend have shown a dependence upon solar activity, with larger F10.7 values resulting in lower neutral density reductions. To investigate the impact on the future thermosphere, the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with ionosphere and thermosphere extension has been used to simulate the thermosphere under increasing carbon dioxide concentrations and varying solar activity conditions. These neutral density reductions have then been mapped onto the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The neutral density reductions can also be used as a scaling factor, allowing commonly used empirical models to account for CO 2 trends. Under the &#8220;best case&#8221; SSP1&#8208;2.6 scenario, neutral densities reductions at 400 km altitude peak (when CO 2 = 474 ppm) at a reduction of 13%&#8211;30% (under high and low solar activity respectively) compared to the year 2000. Higher CO 2 concentrations lead to greater density reductions, with the largest modeled concentration of 890 ppm resulting in a 50%&#8211;77% reduction at 400 km, under high and low solar activity respectively.</description>

      <title>Research Progress and Hotspot Analysis of Low-Carbon Landscapes Based on CiteSpace Analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16177646</link>
      <description>Wei Hou, Fan Liu, Yanqin Zhang, Jiaying Dong, Shumeng Lin, Minhua Wang, Sustainability. 16(17)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402196442

                Global climate change caused by carbon dioxide emissions has become a hot topic globally. It is of great significance to study how low-carbon landscapes can reduce carbon emissions and improve the ecological environment. In this study, CiteSpace software was used to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the research field. The analysis data were based on 2910 studies published in the research field from 2002 to 2023. By analyzing the number of publications in the research field, cooperation networks, keywords, etc., the research status, processes, and hotspots of low-carbon landscapes were systematically reviewed. The results show the following: (1) Between 2002 and 2023, low-carbon landscape research developed rapidly, gradually becoming a multidisciplinary field. A large number of studies were conducted by relevant institutions and scholars from 106 countries. (2) The research focuses on carbon emission reduction, renewable energy, life cycle assessment, etc. The research mainly goes through the following stages: theoretical research on low-carbon technology, the application of low-carbon technology, and the development of the low-carbon economy. (3) Research frontiers focus on low-carbon landscape emission-reduction technologies, low-carbon landscape research methods, and the development and application of low-carbon materials. This study deeply analyzes the research process of low-carbon landscapes and puts forward a research direction for low-carbon landscapes in future urban development, such as economic benefit assessments, ecosystem restoration and protection, social participation, and policy support, in order to provide a reference for low-carbon landscape research.</description>

      <title>Research on Carbon-Peak Prediction in Zhejiang&#8217;s Manufacturing Sector from a Multi-Scenario Perspective Based on STIRPAT</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/189293</link>
      <description>Nixi Wei, Dili Dong, Polish Journal of Environmental Studies. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402118364

                Using China's "dual-carbon" targets as a reference, this paper focuses on Zhejiang's manufacturing sector as the research object and constructs a STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology)-based model to analyze the factors influencing carbon emissions associated with manufacturing and predict the peak emission levels.Among these influencing factors, investmentscale expansion and economic growth contribute to increases in carbon emissions, while energystructure optimization and reduced carbon-emission intensity help restrain them.Notably, the economic level is identified as the predominant factor affecting carbon emissions.Among the nine proposed scenarios, scenario 6, characterized by "medium growth" and "high emission reduction", emerges as the most conducive to achieving high-quality and sustainable growth.Its carbon peak is projected for 2026, reaching 75.15 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions, making it the optimal model for Zhejiang's manufacturing sector.Based on the findings, two policy directions are proposed: optimize the energy-consumption structure and accelerate the development and use of low-carbon technologies.This research offers insights into carbon emissions in Zhejiang's manufacturing sector, presenting a blueprint for achieving a carbon peak and sustainable economic growth.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Highway Transportation Infrastructure on Carbon Emissions in the Yangtze River Delta Region</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16177515</link>
      <description>Yongyou Nie, Junhao Jiang, Sustainability. 16(17)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402052528

                To address the increasingly severe issue of carbon dioxide emissions, the Chinese government has set dual carbon goals: achieving peak carbon emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. Studying the impact of highway transportation infrastructure on carbon emissions is crucial for achieving these dual carbon goals and promoting sustainable development. Using balanced panel data from 41 cities in the Yangtze River Delta region from 2006 to 2019, this paper empirically analyzed the relationship and mechanisms of highway transportation infrastructure&#8217;s impact on carbon emissions using fixed effects models, mediating effects models, and threshold effects models. The empirical results indicate: (1) there is a nonlinear inverted-U-shaped relationship between highway transportation infrastructure and carbon emissions; (2) highway transportation infrastructure indirectly affects carbon emissions through foreign direct investment as a mediating variable; (3) the threshold effect model verifies that the impact of highway transportation infrastructure on carbon emissions exhibits threshold effects based on green technological innovation and industrial structure upgrading. This study enriches the research content in related fields to some extent and provides specific policy recommendations for achieving carbon reduction goals and promoting sustainable development.</description>

                Abstract The use of green renewable energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into valuable chemicals and fuels through CO 2 electrolysis technology (also known as electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction, eCO 2 RR) is an advantageous technology, which could greatly aid the global carbon&#8208;neutral goal. Although progress has been made in alkaline/neutral media, low carbon conversion efficiency to target products, carbonate/bicarbonate salt precipitation, and blockage of electrode holes caused by CO 2 are not conducive to industrial applications. Acidic media could address these issues; however, in these conditions, there are other challenges that need to be addressed, such as hydrogen evolution, poor tolerance of electrocatalysts, and electrolysers. This review discusses recent advances in industrial&#8208;level acidic CO 2 electrolysis, including reaction mechanisms, electrocatalysts, and device design, aiming to promote its commercialization. In addition, a comprehensive evaluation strategy of an acidic eCO 2 RR system is proposed, and perspectives are provided based on related discussion.</description>

                The growing need for clean and renewable energy sources, driven by a shortage of fossil fuels and serious environmental concerns, has made finding catalysts for energy conversion applications a significant challenge. The key reactions essential for converting and producing green energy include the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Recently, the novel and rapid expansion of coordination materials, such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), porous coordination polymers (PCPs), and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have led to the creation of remarkable properties, allowing the development of heterostructures for various applications in different fields. Enhancing clean energy production efficiency is considered the essential promise of coordination materials, with their controlled structures, effective functionalizations, large surface areas, and high porosity. In this chapter, we summarize the brief overview of multifunctional coordination materials and their applications for green energy production.</description>

                Abstract. A growing body of evidence suggests that to achieve the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will likely be required in addition to massive carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reductions. Nature-based CDR, which includes a range of strategies to sequester carbon in natural reservoirs, could play an important role in efforts to limit climate warming to well below 2 &#176;C above preindustrial levels. Agricultural CDR could enhance soil carbon sequestration, though the climate efficacy of such methods remains uncertain. Here, we use an intermediate complexity climate model to perform simulations of agricultural CDR in the form of soil carbon sequestration at a range of possible rates for different costs under three future emissions scenarios. We found that plausible levels of agricultural CDR were able to reduce CO2 concentration by 5&#8211;19 ppm and global surface air temperature by 0.02&#8211;0.10 &#176;C by the end of century. This temperature decrease was non-linear with respect to cumulative removals, as any carbon removed remained part of the active carbon cycle, lessening the climate benefit compared to if the removed carbon was permanently stored in geological reservoirs. CDR was found to be more effective at reducing surface air temperature in low emissions scenarios, but less effective at reducing atmospheric CO2, compared to high emissions scenarios. This was because the weaker CO2 sinks in a high CO2 world had a more muted response to removal, so a substantially higher proportion of carbon was removed from the atmosphere for a given amount of CDR in a higher emissions scenario. The enhanced temperature response to CDR in lower emissions scenarios was due to the logarithmic response of radiative effects to changes in CO2, where at low atmospheric CO2 concentrations, small changes in CO2 are more effective at changing the global radiative balance than at higher CO2 concentrations. CDR was substantially more effective when implemented at a higher rate, as CDR makes a proportionally larger difference in a climate with lower cumulative air fraction of CO2. Land and soil carbon responses were driven by the scenario-dependent balances between the impacts of CDR on primary productivity from CO2 fertilization, and the impacts on soil respiration from increased soil carbon availability and global temperatures.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Nanomaterial&#8217;s in Air Filtration and Purification</title>

                Industrialization and urbanization are amongst the major sources of air pollution. Though high-performance nanomaterials offer compelling advances for air filtration and purification. In this work, several nanomaterials were tested for their ability to remove particulates (PM2.5 and PM10) and VOCs, while evaluating the wear and tear of each material. Pressure had no effect on PM2.5 capture efficiency which was 80% using activated carbon, while carbon nanotubes were more efficient in PM10 capture despite greater pressure drop. Graphene oxide was very effective in the abatement of volatile organic compounds, which was not the case for titanium dioxide which performed as good as activated carbon in the capture of PM2.5 particles but with a pressure drop of the same magnitude. Silver nanoparticles were the most effective in a percent capture of PM10 particles at low pressure drop. Yeoman&#8217;s zinc was effective in re-absorbing volatile organic compounds from the dust. The PEI-coated and electro spun nanofibers are capable of capturing PM2.5 and PM10 particles respectively, and at relatively low-pressure reductions. Results from durability studies demonstrated that TiO2 and silver nanoparticles exhibited superior efficiency retention throughout numerous cycles, but PEI-coated nanofibers saw substantial efficiency degradation</description>

      <title>Analysis of Synergistic Drivers of CO2 and NOX Emissions from Thermal Power Generating Units in Beijing&#8211;Tianjin&#8211;Hebei Region, 2010&#8211;2020</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16177554</link>
      <description>Y J Wang, Zilin Yuan, Jun Yan, Haixu Zhang, Qingsong Guan, Shengxiang Rao, Chunlai Jiang, Zhongxia Duan, Sustainability. 16(17)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402125223

                Synergistic control of the emissions of air pollutants and CO2 is critical to the dual challenges of air quality improvement and climate change in China. Based on the emission inventories of thermal power units in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, this study analyzes the CO2 and NOX emission characteristics of these units, and identifies and quantifies the synergistic drivers affecting these emission trends. The inventory data show that, between 2010 and 2020, NOX emissions were reduced by 86.1%, while CO2 emissions were reduced by only 29.8%. Although significant progress has been made in reducing NOX emissions through measures such as end-of-pipe treatment, controlling CO2 emissions remains a difficult task. The index decomposition analysis reveals that economic growth is the main driver of CO2 and NOX emission growth, energy intensity reduction is the main driver of CO2 emission reduction, and end-of-pipe treatment is the main driver of NOX emission reduction. Currently, coal occupies about 87% of the energy consumption of thermal power units in the Beijing&#8211;Tianjin&#8211;Hebei region, and remains the main type of energy for synergistic emissions, and the potential for emission reduction in the energy structure remains huge. For NOX emissions, it is expected that 90% of the reduction potential can be achieved through energy restructuring and end-of-pipe treatment. In conclusion, this high-precision unit-by-unit emission study confirms the effectiveness of the control policy for thermal power units in the region and provides some scientific reference for future policy formulation.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Directions of Transformation of the Mining and Metallurgical Complex of Ukraine</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.32983/2222-4459-2024-6-217-225</link>
      <description>Mykola O. Kyzym, Viktoriia Ye. Khaustova, Yevhen I. Kotliarov, Ihor V. Shulha, Business Inform. 6(557)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401996361

                The aim of the article is to select and substantiate the technology of blast-furnace (coke-free) steel production, which can be used in Ukraine, taking into account the existing raw material base, the provision of the necessary energy resources and other specific conditions of the country. Technologies of direct reduction of iron (coke-free metallurgy), which are of industrial importance, are based on the interaction of iron ore (in the form of pellets) with synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide). In this case, hydrogen is used as an iron reducing agent, and carbon monoxide is burned with the release of heat necessary for the chemical reaction to take place. Synthesis gas on an industrial scale is produced either by steam catalytic conversion of natural gas or by coal gasification. Production of synthesis gas from natural gas can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared to coke oven metallurgy (from 1.4&#8211;1.7 to 0.328 tons of carbon dioxide per 1 ton of iron). Yet, in the current conditions of Ukraine, this technology cannot be used due to the shortage of natural gas and high prices for it. Direct reduction of iron by synthesis gas obtained from coal in Ukrainian conditions has great prospects due to the presence of large reserves and developed coal mining of those grades of coal that are most suitable for gasification. Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with this technology can be achieved if synthesis gas with a hydrogen content of more than 67% is obtained at the gasification stage. The article also discusses the prospects of hydrogen metallurgy, in which only hydrogen obtained by electrolysis of water is used as a reducing agent and a source of heat necessary for the reaction. Under the current conditions of Ukraine, the only source of electricity for electrolysis can be considered a specially built solar power plant. It is calculated that a power plant with a capacity of more than 100 MW is required to produce 1 million tons of direct reduced iron. The possibility of constructing a complex for the production of direct reduced iron using only hydrogen requires further research.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence-Based Performance Maps for Expander-Compressor Analysis in Energy Transition Applications</title>

                Abstract Limiting the global warming impact requires a drastic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) to reach a zero-carbon growth by 2050. Against this backdrop, turbomachinery designers are asked to develop more compact, efficient, and reliable machines. The research focuses on developing machines able to reduce energy losses and overall footprint, thus improving power plants efficiency and operability. To this end, expander-compressors (EC) seem to play a key role in the energy transition and appear a promising technology for high-density plants, especially together with hydrogen (H2) or supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) as working fluid. However, when operating conditions changes, a reduction in machine efficiency may be expected, with a consequent degradation of the overall system performance. In order to optimize the operation of the power plant, it is crucial to understand how the variation of the expander-compressor behavior affects the working conditions of the other components of the plant. In this perspective, a fast and reliable way to estimate the EC performance at different operating conditions is necessary. Although the scientific literature shows several studies on mean-line approaches for expanders and centrifugal compressors, the joint use of 1D models with artificial neural networks (ANN) for ECs combined machine is still overlooked. To fill this gap, the prediction of artificial intelligence (AI)-based performance maps is proposed in this work. The tool has been tested in a case study based on a real EC. Results showed a rapid evaluation of EC efficiency while varying the operating conditions.</description>

                The global climate is currently warming due to human activity. The period 2011&#8211;2020 was recorded as the warmest decade. CO2 produced by human activity is the biggest contributor to global warming. Since every ton of CO2 emitted contributes to global warming, all emissions reductions can help to slow it down. Currently, the cars used by the population still do not ensure a sufficient reduction of CO2 emissions. The purpose of paper is to investigate the potential of electromobility development as a means to mitigate CO2 emissions in EU countries. The research methodology: statistical and comparable analysis of environmental and economic factors influencing the electromobility development in EU countries during last decade were performed. The conclusions of paper provide results of electromobility development, the main obstacles and needed government policies and incentives.</description>

      <description>Jie Zhang, Janet S. S. Wong, H. A. Spikes, Tribology Letters. 72(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401944858

                Abstract A sealed reciprocating tribometer has been used to study the influence of different gaseous environments on the friction and wear properties of AISI52100 bearing steel at atmospheric pressure and 25 &#176;C. Helium, argon, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen all give high friction and wear, suggestive of very little, if any tribofilm formation under the conditions studied. Dry air and oxygen also give high friction, slightly lower than the inert gases, but produce extremely high wear, much higher than the inert gases. This is characteristic of the phenomenon of &#8220;oxidational wear&#8221;. The two gases ammonia and carbon monoxide give relatively low friction and wear, and XPS analysis indicates that this is due to the formation of adsorbed ammonia/nitride and carbonate films respectively. For the hydrocarbon gases studied, two factors appear to control friction and wear, degree of unsaturation and molecular weight. For the saturated hydrocarbons, methane and ethane give high friction and wear but propane and butane give low friction after a period of rubbing that decreases with molecular weight. The unsaturated hydrocarbons all give an immediate reduction in friction with correspondingly low wear. Raman analysis shows that all the hydrocarbons that reduce friction and wear form a carbonaceous tribofilm on the rubbed surfaces. Graphical Abstract</description>

      <title>Planning for Introducing Electric Buses Based on Ecological and Financial Impacts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.22158/asir.v8n3p189</link>
      <description>Hengrui Song, Zhiyuan Zhang, Yang Zhao, Xiaole Zou, Applied Science and Innovative Research. 8(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401962576

                The transition from fossil fuel-powered buses to electric buses has emerged as a central concern in recent years. Governments worldwide are urging this shift in major urban centers as a strategic response to ecological challenges, particularly issues related to pollution and carbon emissions. The primary impediment to the electrification transition lies in real-world financial constraints. Consequently, comprehending both the ecological benefits and financial intricacies of transitioning bus fleets is paramount.In the initial section of this paper, we formulate a mathematical model to assess the reduction in carbon emissions and pollution resulting from a complete transition of the bus fleet. This model is then applied to the city of Sendai, Japan. By comparing the carbon dioxide and emission gases released by conventional buses with those emitted by electric buses, we can discern the impact of employing electric buses on the urban ecological environment.Moving on to the second section, we present a mathematical model delineating the financial aspects of the transition. We use Sendai as a real-world exemplar for our model. The economic model is categorized into expenditures and revenues. Expenditures encompass the acquisition of electric buses, maintenance costs, and carbon taxes. On the income side, we consider bus fares, revenue from bus advertising, the budget of the bus company, and government subsidies. By subtracting expenditures from revenues, we can ascertain the financial ramifications of transitioning to electric buses.Following the evaluation from both ecological and financial perspectives of the bus fleet's electric transition, a third model is constructed mathematically to address the optimal planning solution for a city aiming to fully electrify its bus fleet within a decade. The objective is to achieve cost-efficiency: to be the most economical while meeting ecological goals. Finally, the cities of Sendai, Kunshan, and Nashville serve as subjects for our model, each providing a tailored solution to the transition planning.</description>

      <description>Ji Yeon Hong, Ga Ram Ahn, Hyun Jung Kim, Joon Seok, Kui Young Park, Skin Research and Technology. 30(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402133220

                Abstract Background Acne vulgaris poses a significant dermatological challenge, necessitating alternative treatments due to limitations and side effects associated with current therapies. This pilot clinical trial investigated the feasibility and efficacy of precision cryotherapy for acne vulgaris. Methods A total of 20 volunteers underwent targeted precision cryotherapy using a carbon dioxide&#8208;based device. Treatment outcomes were assessed using various parameters, including Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score, acne lesion count, erythema index (EI), global evaluation score, and participant satisfaction. Safety monitoring included adverse event reporting and physical examination. Results Precision cryotherapy demonstrated a significant reduction (90.25%) in the acne lesion count by week 4, with clinical improvement indicated by IGA score reduction ( p &lt; 0.001). The EI showed notable improvements at weeks 1, 2, and 4. The global evaluation score demonstrated a 75%&#8211;100% clinical improvement at Visit 4. Participants reported high satisfaction (6.75 &#177; 0.79) with the procedure. No adverse event or discomfort was reported. Conclusion Precision cryotherapy effectively improved acne lesions, which was safe and satisfactory for participants. These findings suggest its potential as an alternative therapeutic modality, especially for populations with limited treatment options. Further research is needed to validate the results and explore underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Life Cycle Assessment of CO2-Based and Conventional Methanol Production Pathways in Thailand</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12091868</link>
      <description>Adeel Rafiq, Ahsan Farooq, Shabbir H. Gheewala, Processes. 12(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402130289

                Methanol production through carbon capture and utilization technologies offers promising alternatives to traditional natural-gas-based methods, potentially mitigating climate change impacts and improving resource efficiency. This study evaluates four methanol production pathways: CO2 hydrogenation, tri-reforming of methane, electrochemical CO2 reduction, and co-electrolysis of CO2 and water. The analysis covers 19 scenarios, combining three electricity mixes (100% Thai grid mix, 50% Thai grid mix and 50% renewable energy, and 100% renewable energy) with two hydrogen production technologies (alkaline water electrolysis and grey hydrogen). Environmental life cycle assessment results showed that most pathways perform well when using the 100% renewable energy with co-electrolysis (CE-100%) showing the most substantial reductions across all impact categories as compared conventional methanol production. Electrochemical reduction demonstrated the poorest environmental performance for all scenarios. In Thailand, implementing the CE-100% pathway could potentially yield 12.4 million tonnes of methanol annually from the cement industry&#8217;s CO2 emissions, with an estimated value of approximately USD 5.4 billion, while reducing emissions from the industrial processes and product use (IPPU) sector by 75%. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers, supporting Thailand&#8217;s transition towards sustainable methanol production and broader climate goals.</description>

      <title>Heat transport in SiCOH thin films: an experimental and molecular dynamics study</title>

                Abstract Carbon-doped silicon dioxide (SiCOH) film is currently regarded as one of the most promising low-k materials in the integrated circuits (ICs) industry for advanced technology nodes. However, there have been limited studies on the thermal properties of SiCOH compared to its electrical and mechanical properties. In this study, we investigate the thermal conductivity of SiCOH thin films through molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and experimental characterizations. Our findings indicate that the size effect on thermal conductivity at 300 K is negligible when the thickness of SiCOH film is less than 20 nm. Additionally, we observe a contrasting temperature dependence law for the thermal conductivity of SiCOH thin films compared to crystal SiO2 thin films. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant decrease in thermal conductivity with increasing porosity in SiCOH films; specifically, an increase in porosity from 5.35% to 42.77% results in a 60% reduction in thermal conductivity. Moreover, we validate our simulation results by characterizing the thermal conductivity of SiCOH using 3&#969; method.&amp;#xD;</description>

      <description>Zakaria Hamdi, W. C. Cheong, Mahmood Bataee, Behzad Partoon, No host. 208(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402144822

                Abstract The Hydrate-based CO2 Storage/Sequestration technique has the potential to contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 by enabling efficient and safe storage of CO2. This paper explores the potential of CO2 storage through gas hydrate formation in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, an innovative approach to mitigating climate change by reducing atmospheric CO2 levels. The current applications and potentials of gas hydrates are examined, highlighting their role in energy production, CO2 reduction via oceanic injection, energy storage, and other uses. Geological considerations are analyzed, emphasizing the self-sealing potential of CO2 hydrates, the mechanisms of CO2 sequestration through hydrate formation, and the impact of hydrate presence on reservoir permeability. Simulation studies provide insights into the feasibility and efficiency of this method. Various approaches for CO2 hydrate sequestration are discussed, outlining the practical steps and technological requirements involved. The environmental implications and potential challenges of CO2 hydrate sequestration are evaluated, considering the ecological impacts and long-term sustainability. This comprehensive review suggests that while CO2 storage through gas hydrate formation in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs holds significant promise, it necessitates further research and technological advancements to address the identified challenges and fully realize its potential as a viable climate mitigation strategy.</description>

      <description>Pinak Mohapatra, Sonu Kumar, Ashin A. Sunny, M. Marx, Yehia Khalifa, Amanda H. Trout, Liang&#8208;Shih Fan, Energy &amp; Fuels. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401976157

                In this study, we explore a novel approach to nitrogen oxide (NOx) purification based on the principles of the chemical looping (CL) platform. This technique harnesses the reducing power of natural gas (CH4), instead of ammonia, to eliminate NOx in the flue gas, addressing environmental concerns such as ammonia slip in the state-of-the-art selective catalytic reduction process. The CL scheme involves utilizing nickel oxide (NiO) as the solid oxygen carrier to facilitate oxygen transfer from NOx to CH4 in two steps. In the first step (carrier oxidation), NOx in the flue gas reacts with reduced nickel (Ni), transferring its [O] to the carrier, thereby forming NiO. In the subsequent step (carrier reduction), CH4 reacts with the lattice oxygen of the oxidized carrier, generating a pure stream of CO2 and reducing NiO to Ni. We designed a high-performance carrier by dispersing NiO on an inert support to enhance the carrier's kinetics and thermal stability. We evaluated various support materials, and among them, alumina (Al2O3) and zirconia (ZrO2) demonstrated significantly superior reactivity. Notably, the Al2O3-supported carrier outperformed the ZrO2-supported carrier in NO purification and CH4 reduction and demonstrated stable performance over 10 redox cycles. Furthermore, fixed-bed experiments revealed 100% NO conversion during carrier oxidation, with optimal reaction kinetics achieved at lower space velocities, resulting in an overall high carrier utilization. Importantly, CO2 showcased no adverse effects during the NOx purification step. During the carrier reduction, complete combustion was favored, leading to CH4 conversion exceeding 95% and a CO2 selectivity of 90% at 400 &#176;C. The CL NOx purification approach represents a promising strategy for mitigating NOx emissions.</description>

      <title>Successful Story in Offshore EOR Full Field Development (Shengli - CB22F), Production Increase, Energy Savings!</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/220656-ms</link>
      <description>Dorian Rotier, Jianhua Gong, Li Bi, Li Chen, Guillaume Dupuis, Marine Cognet, M. Tizzotti, Chenghao Zhu, Flavien Gathier, Marie&#8208;Paule Lefranc, No host. 17(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402144821

                Abstract This paper presents the implementation of chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR) on the offshore platform CB22F, detailing its impact over three years and proposing improvements for future deployments. It discusses the project's effects, such as increased oil production, reduced water cut, and lowered CO2 emissions, while sharing insights for optimizing future CEOR designs on two newly sanctioned platforms. The CEOR strategy on CB22F has shown significant outcomes, demonstrated by an increase in oil production, a reduction in water cut, and a decrease in CO2 emissions. Oil production increased by 663 of barrels per day (b/d), the water cut decreased from 90% to 80.5%, reducing the volumes of water handled. This decrease in water cut lowered energy consumption for water pumping and chemical treatment costs for produced water, leading to a reduction in cost and CO2 emissions to produce one barrel of oil. The test area began showing positive effects by June 2021, with a significant decrease in water content in produced fluids in 2022 and a rapid increase in oil output. By the end of March 2024, the water cut stabilized around 80.5%, and the cumulative oil increase from the 44 effective production wells reached 3,800,000 barrels, corresponding to a 4.27% increase in oil recovery. This cumulative increase translates to 28.9 tons of oil per ton of polymer injected, indicating the project's economic viability. Building on the success of CB22F, CEOR will be implemented on two newly sanctioned platforms with designs incorporating improvements learned from CB22F's experience. Bulk polymer delivery via pneumatic transfer will mitigate hoisting risks, improve occupational health, increase offshore storage capacity, and reduce delivery rotations, thus decreasing CO2 emissions associated with logistic operations. An integrated injection system will involve a centralized polymer injection system on the main platform, facilitating efficient distribution to both main and satellite platforms. The introduction of new Conical Pressure Reducer (CPR) skids, equipped with low shear valves, will regulate injection pressure, and adapt the polymer concentration for individual wells, minimizing polymer degradation and footprint compared to conventional methods. To address higher polymer/surfactant concentrations in produced fluids, concerns regarding emulsification are being managed through the development of new, high-efficiency water clarifiers. These improvements, guided by CB22F's experience, are expected to further optimize CEOR performance and efficiency on future platforms. This paper provides insights for engineers by demonstrating a successful CEOR implementation with concrete results and data, sharing practical improvements for future CEOR designs on offshore platforms, addressing potential challenges, and proposing viable solutions. Additionally, it contributes to knowledge on CO2 reduction strategies in oil and gas production, highlighting the environmental benefits alongside the financial gains. The reduction in CO2 emissions per barrel of oil produced underscores the broader impact of the project beyond immediate financial gains, contributing to the long-term sustainability of oil production operations.</description>

                The complexity of a sustainable economy is rooted in its socio-economic and environmental intricacies, particularly in formulating pathways for the harmonious integration of these parameters. This study introduces an extended input-output analysis and a multi-objective optimisation framework designed to discern trajectories for reducing CO2 emissions while simultaneously maximising GDP and employment. The economic alterations are evaluated through metrics facilitating the examination of both direct and indirect consequences stemming from perturbations within the economy. The focus of this research centres on the French economy, concentrating on pivotal sectors where reducing demand could yield the greatest reduction in CO2 emissions with minimal socio-economic ramifications. Additionally, a model is outlined for energy substitution, wherein fossil fuels in the French electricity mix are supplanted with clean energies. The ensuing effects of such a model on emission reduction pathways are scrutinised, followed by a comparison with the baseline case study.</description>

                Abstract This work reports the production of polymeric nanocapsules of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)/phase change materials (PCM), using continuous supercritical emulsion extraction (SEE&#8208;C). Five fatty acids (FAs) were tested: capric (CA), lauric (LA), myristic (MA), palmitic (PA), and stearic (SA) acid, using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC&#8208;CO 2 ) operating at 80 bar and 38&#176;C in a tower apparatus. The two fatty acids with lower molecular weight (CA and LA) were extracted by the supercritical solvent and capsules were not obtained. The other three FAs formed spherical, non&#8208;coalescing nanocapsules characterized by mean diameters ranging between 134 and 252 nm, as shown by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analysis, with a sharp particles size distribution and encapsulation efficiencies up to 99.8%. Differential scanning calorimetric analysis (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and derivative thermogravimetric analysis (DTG) analyses confirmed the successful encapsulation, allowing the measurement of the energy storage properties of produced capsules. Stability analysis performed over 5 months showed that the nanocapsules were stable in this time interval. Thermal cycles experiments confirmed the thermal stability of the capsules. The best performance was obtained for PA based nanocapsules, which showed a stability reduction of only 0.43% after 25 thermal cycles.</description>

      <title>Influence of Copper Surfaces on CO2 vs. CO C&#8208;C Coupling Efficiency</title>

                CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) powered by renewable electricity is critical for transitioning to a carbon&#8208;neutral society by transforming CO2 into essential commodities and fuels. The formation of multi&#8208;carbon compounds through C&#8208;C coupling reactions is crucial due to their high energy density and broad industrial uses. Traditionally, C&#8208;C coupling was believed to occur through the reaction of *CO (surface&#8208;bound CO) with *C1 intermediates (surface&#8208;bound hydrocarbons with one carbon atom produced during CO2ER). In this study, we used DFT calculations combined with a constant electrode potential model to discover a preference for CO2 + *C1 over conventional *CO + *C1 coupling on three commonly observed copper surfaces including Cu(111), Cu(110), and Cu(100). This result demonstrates that CO2 is a more efficient carbon source than *CO for coupling with *C1. Among the nine *C1 species investigated, *CHO, *CHOH, *C, *CH, and *CH2 show greater reactivity towards CO2 + *C1 couplings on all the surfaces. Thus, enhancing CO2ER efficiency necessitates increasing the surface concentrations of these five *C1 intermediates, and several strategies have been proposed to accomplish this goal.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis and optimal allocation of virtual inertia from grid&#8208;forming and grid&#8208;following controlled ESSs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1049/rpg2.13085</link>
      <description>Naixuan Zhu, Pengfei Hu, Chongxi Jiang, Yanxue Yu, Daozhuo Jiang, IET Renewable Power Generation. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402138599

                Abstract A broad consensus of neutralizing the carbon dioxide emissions facilitates the transition to the renewable energy power system. Meanwhile, the concerns about the volatility of renewable energies are growing as the rotational inertia of power system becomes inadequate. To maintain the frequency stability of power system, some studies for configuring inertia energy storage systems (ESSs) are carried out, mainly focusing on the allocation of virtual inertia from grid&#8208;forming ESS. In contrast, the allocation of virtual inertia from grid&#8208;following ESS has not been well elaborated and the differences in virtual inertia provided by these two modes are yet to be revealed. Based on &#8208;norm and Kron reduction, firstly, the state&#8208;space model of post&#8208;disturbance system is established, together with the transient performance evaluation. Then the inertia characteristics of both grid&#8208;forming and grid&#8208;following devices are formulated, followed by the unified gradient descent optimization method for allocating virtual inertia. A modified IEEE 39&#8208;bus system and its time&#8208;domain simulations help in the verification of the contribution of this paper. Through the comparative analysis of corresponding optimal results, the conclusions from two aspects are drawn: in terms of transient frequency support, the grid&#8208;forming devices can provide no less than better inertia support; with the higher power capacity and similar energy capacity, the grid&#8208;forming devices can relieve the response pressure of other generators by approximately .</description>

                The reaction of aluminum bis-formate acenaphthene-1,2-diimine complex [(ArBIG-bian)Al(&#956;-OC(H)O)2Li(Thf)2] (I) (ArBIG-bian = 1,2-bis[(2,6-dibenzhydryl-4-methylphenyl)imino]acenaphthene), prepared by binding carbon dioxide by aluminum diimine hydride [(ArBIG-bian)Al(H)2]&#8211;[Li(Thf)4]+, with borane dimethyl sulfide and ammonia was studied. The reaction of I with BH3&#8729;SMe2 (1 : 1) in toluene affords the product of hydroboration of one formate group [(ArBIG-bian)Al(&#956;-OC(H)O)(OB(H)OCH3)Li(Thf)]2 (II), while the reaction of I with BH3&#8729;SMe2 (1 : 2) is accompanied by reduction of both formate groups and gives complex [(ArBIG-bian)Al(OBOCH3)2OLi2(Thf)2BH4]2 (III), methoxyboroxine (CH3OBO)3 and, presumably, compound [(ArBIG-bian)AlOCH3]. The reaction of I with one equivalent of ammonia in THF gives adduct [(ArBIG-bian)Al(NH3)(&#956;-OC(H)O)2Li(Thf)2] (IV), in which ammonia is coordinated to the aluminum atom, while the key bonds in I have not undergone ammonolysis. Compounds II&#8211;IV were characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and X-ray diffraction (CCDC no. 2255017 (II), 2255018 (III), 2255019 (IV)).</description>

      <title>Periplasmic carbonic anhydrase CAH1 contributes to high inorganic carbon affinity in &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt;</title>

                Abstract Carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme conserved across species, is pivotal in the interconversion of inorganic carbon (Ci; CO2 and HCO3&#8211;). Compared to the well-studied intracellular CA, the specific role of extracellular CA in photosynthetic organisms is still not well understood. In the green alga Chlamydomonas (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii), carbonic anhydrase 1 (CAH1), located at the periplasmic space, is strongly induced under CO2-limiting conditions by the Myb transcription factor LCR1. While the lcr1 mutant shows decreased Ci-affinity, the detailed mechanisms behind this phenomenon are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to unravel the LCR1-dependent genes essential for maintaining high Ci-affinity. To achieve this, we identified a total of 12 LCR1-dependent inducible genes under CO2-limiting conditions, focusing specifically on the most prominent ones - CAH1, LCI1, LCI6, and Cre10.g426800. We then created mutants of these genes using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, all from the same parental strain, and compared their Ci-affinity. Contrary to earlier findings that reported no reduction in Ci-affinity in the cah1 mutant, our cah1-1 mutant exhibited a decrease in Ci-affinity under high HCO3&#8211;/CO2-ratio conditions. Additionally, when we treated wild-type cells with a CA inhibitor with low membrane permeability, a similar reduction in Ci-affinity was observed. Moreover, the addition of exogenous CA to the cah1 mutant rescued the decreased Ci-affinity. These results, highlighting the crucial function of the periplasmic CAH1 in maintaining high Ci-affinity in Chlamydomonas cells, provide insights into the functions of periplasmic CA in algal carbon assimilation.</description>

      <title>The Serine Shunt enables formate conversion to formaldehyde &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/sumbio/qvae024</link>

                Abstract Microbial valorization of CO2-derived substrates has emerged as a promising approach to address climate change and resource scarcity. Formate, which can be efficiently produced from CO2, shows great potential as a sustainable feedstock for biotechnological production. However, the scope of formate assimilation pathways is restricted by the limited number of natural formate-assimilating enzymes. To overcome this limitation, several new-to-nature routes for formate assimilation based on its reduction to formaldehyde have been proposed, but they suffer from low catalytic efficiencies and cannot yet support bacterial growth. Here, we propose the Serine Shunt as a novel formate reduction route and demonstrate its activity in vivo. In this pathway, formate is attached to glycine to form serine, which is subsequently cleaved into formaldehyde and glycine, thereby effectively converting formate to formaldehyde. Unlike other formate reduction routes, the Serine Shunt mainly utilizes natural reactions with favorable enzyme kinetics, while requiring the same amount of ATP and NADPH as the most efficient new-to-nature route. We implemented the Serine Shunt in engineered Escherichia coli strains using a step-wise approach by dividing the pathway into metabolic modules. After validating the individual module activities, we demonstrated the in vivo activity of the complete Serine Shunt by measuring intracellular formaldehyde production with a GFP sensor and coupling its activity to cell growth. Our results indicate that the Serine Shunt could be applied as a novel formate reduction route in methylotrophic hosts relevant for biotechnology.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Solar-Assisted CCHP Systems: Enhancing Efficiency and Reducing Emissions through Harris Hawks-Based Mathematical Modeling</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202408.2130.v1</link>
      <description>Uchechi Ukaegbu, Lagouge K. Tartibu, C.W. Lim, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402074235

                The increasing demand for energy, driven by technological advances, population growth, and economic expansion, has intensified the focus on efficient energy management. Tri-generation systems, such as Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power (CCHP) systems, are of particular interest due to their efficiency and sustainability. Integrating renewable energy sources like solar power with traditional fossil fuels further optimizes CCHP systems. This study presents a novel method for enhancing CCHP system efficiency by identifying optimal design parameters and assisting decision-makers in selecting the best geometric configurations. A mathematical programming model using the Harris Hawks optimizer was developed to maximize net power and exergy efficiency while minimizing CO2 emissions in a solar-assisted CCHP system. The optimization resulted in 100 Pareto optimal solutions, offering various choices for performance improvement. This method achieved higher net power output, satisfactory exergy efficiency, and lower CO2 emissions compared to similar studies. The study shows that maximum net power and exergy efficiency, with reduced CO2 emissions, can be achieved with a system having a low compression ratio and low combustion chamber inlet temperature. The proposed approach surpassed the response surface method, achieving at least a 4.2% reduction in CO2 emissions and improved exergy values.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Methane Dry Reforming: Investigating Nickel&#8211;Zeolite Catalysts Enhanced by Promoter Integration</title>

                A promising method for converting greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4 into useful syngas is the dry reformation of methane (DRM). 5Ni-ZSM-5 and 2 wt.% Ce, Cs, Sr, Fe, and Cu-promoted 5Ni-ZSM-5 catalysts are investigated for the DRM at 700 &#176;C under atmospheric pressure. The characterization, including XRD, TPR, TPD, TPO, N2 adsorption&#8211;desorption, TGA, TEM, and Raman spectroscopy, revealed that the catalyst&#8217;s active sites are distributed throughout the pore channels and on the surface, contributing to the stability of the catalyst. Specifically, the CO2-TPO followed by the O2-TPO experiment using spent catalysts confirmed the oxidizing capacity of CO2 during the DRM reaction. The Ce-promoted catalyst showed the greatest increase in catalytic activity among other catalysts. The 5Ni+2Ce-ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited twice the concentration of acid sites compared to the Cs-promoted counterpart, even though both catalysts achieved similar quantities of active and basic sites. Without compromising H2 and CO selectivity, this finding underscores the crucial role of acid sites in enhancing CH4 and CO2 conversion. With a GHSV of 42,000 mL/(h.gcat), the 5Ni+2Ce-ZSM-5 catalyst demonstrated impressive CH4 conversion rates of 42% at 700 &#176;C and 70% at 800 &#176;C. The reactants spend more time over catalysts during the subsequent reduction of GHSV to 21,000 mL/(h.gcat), resulting in the best catalytic performance with 80% CH4 and 83% CO2 conversions.</description>

                Direct Air Capture (DAC) is a rapidly evolving technology that extracts CO2 directly from ambient air. This study presents a comprehensive performance evaluation of integrating DAC in HVAC systems, which can reduce indoor CO2 concentration and improve energy efficiency of HVAC systems. The DAC equipment is modeled in Modelica based on isotherm and thermodynamic equations, and pressure drop curves of the CO2 sorbent described in literature. The model is validated with data from the literature, and then integrated into a typical HVAC system available in Modelica Buildings library. The HVAC system is a Variable Air Volume (VAV) with reheater system for a one-floor office building with standard ASHRAE 2006 control sequences. Demand control ventilation strategies are designed to reduce the outdoor air flowrates when indoor CO2 concentrations are lower than the threshold, which is to maximize the benefits of integrating DAC. Four cases are proposed to assess the impacts of integrating DAC and DCV in HVAC systems in 8 different ASHRAE climate zones in the USA. The results show that by integrating DAC unit into the HVAC system, the average indoor CO2 concentration can be significantly reduced by over 45% against the baseline without a DAC unit. By integrating DCV, 0.39-21.66% of annual energy savings and 226-9539 kg carbon emissions reduction are observed across different climate zones. The highest energy savings are found to be achieved with cold climatic conditions while the lowest energy savings occur with favorable weather.</description>

                ConspectusCarbon dioxide (CO2) is recognized as a greenhouse gas and a common waste product. Simultaneously, it serves as an advantageous and commercially available C1 building block to generate valuable chemicals. Particularly, carboxylation with CO2 is considered a significant method for the direct and sustainable production of important carboxylic acids. However, the utilization of CO2 is challenging owing to its thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. Recently, organic electrosynthesis has emerged as a promising approach that utilizes electrons or holes as environmentally friendly redox reagents to produce reactive intermediates in a controlled and selective manner. This technique holds great potential for the CO2 utilization.Since 2015, our group has been dedicated to exploring the utilization of CO2 in organic synthesis with a particular focus on electrochemical carboxylation. Despite the significant advancements made in this area, there are still many challenges, including the activation of inert substrates, regulation of selectivity, diversity in electrolysis modes, and activation strategies. Over the past 7 years, our team, with many great experts, has presented findings on electrochemical carboxylation with CO2 under mild conditions. In this context, we primarily highlight our contributions to selective electrocarboxylations, encompassing new reaction systems, selectivity control methods, and activation approaches.We commenced our research by establishing a Ni-catalyzed electrochemical carboxylation of unactivated aryl halides and alkyl bromides in conjunction with a useful paired anodic reaction. This approach eliminates the need for sacrificial anodes, rendering the carboxylation process sustainable. To further utilize the widely existing yet cost-effective alkyl chlorides, we have developed a deep electroreductive system to achieve carboxylation of unactivated alkyl chlorides and poly(vinyl chloride), allowing the direct modification and upgrading of waste polymers.Through precise adjustment of the electroreductive conditions, we successfully demonstrated the dicarboxylation of both strained carbocycles and acyclic polyarylethanes with CO2 via C&#8211;C bond cleavage. Furthermore, we have realized the dicarboxylative cyclization of unactivated skipped dienes to produce the valuable ring-tethered adipic acids through single-electron reduction of CO2 to the CO2 radical anion (CO2&#8226;&#8211;). In terms of the asymmetric carboxylation, Guo's and our groups have recently achieved the nickel-catalyzed enantioselective electroreductive carboxylation reaction using racemic propargylic carbonates and CO2, paving the way for the synthesis of enantioenriched propargylic carboxylic acids.In addition to the aforementioned advancements, Lin's and our groups have also developed new electrolysis modes to achieve regiodivergent C&#8211;H carboxylation of N-heteroarenes dictated by electrochemical reactors. The choice of reactors plays a crucial role in determining whether the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reagents are formed anodically, consequently influencing the carboxylation pathways of N-heteroarene radical anions in the distinct electrolyzed environments.</description>

                Members of the genus Shewanella are known for their versatile electron accepting routes, which allow them to couple decomposition of organic matter to reduction of various terminal electron acceptors for heterotrophic growth in diverse environments. Here, we report autotrophic growth of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 with photoelectrons provided by illuminated biogenic CdS nanoparticles. This hybrid system enables photosynthetic oscillatory acetate production from CO2 for over five months, far exceeding other inorganic-biological hybrid system that can only sustain for hours or days. Biochemical, electrochemical and transcriptomic analyses reveal that the efficient electron uptake of S. oneidensis MR-1 from illuminated CdS nanoparticles supplies sufficient energy to stimulate the previously overlooked reductive glycine pathway for CO2 fixation. The continuous solar-to-chemical conversion is achieved by photon induced electric recycling in sulfur species. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this mineral-assisted photosynthesis, as a widely existing and unique model of light energy conversion, could support the sustained photoautotrophic growth of non-photosynthetic microorganisms in nutrient-lean environments and mediate the reversal of coupled carbon and sulfur cycling, consequently resulting in previously unknown environmental effects. In addition, the hybrid system provides a sustainable and flexible platform to develop a variety of solar products for carbon neutrality.</description>

      <title>Reduction of the Emission Footprint of Gas Turbines in Future Energy System Scenarios Through Optimized Hydrogen Admixture Strategies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/gt2024-125595</link>

                Abstract Within the energy sector, the mitigation of climate change necessitates a paradigm change towards the replacement of conventional with sustainable power generation technologies. Due to the inherent volatility of renewable power generation technologies, dispatchable components, such as gas turbines (GT) will have to be used increasingly for residual load balancing. In addition, GTs are expected to operate fewer hours per year, more flexibly, and at lower capacities. However, fuel utilization in GT is inherently linked to emissions. As a potentially CO2-free energy carrier, hydrogen is a promising fuel for GTs and manufacturers are working on suitable combustor technologies. However, the availability of large quantities of CO2-free H2 remains unclear in the near future. Other pollutants such as NOx and emissions due to incomplete combustion are formed differently in part-load. Therefore, optimizing natural gas substitution based on available H2 quantities and load profiles can improve the overall emission footprint beyond just reducing CO2 emissions. In this study, a physical-based gas turbine performance model and an emission calculation tool are used to derive an optimized H2 admixture strategy for different load profiles. Characteristic load demand scenarios are derived from actual load profiles of gas power plants and the emission footprints are comprehensively evaluated by different environmental impact categories. In general, the emission footprint is increased significantly and moderately for capacity reduction and flexibility increase of GT operation. The availability of H2 in the near future is derived from forecasts for Germany, and the corresponding quantities are allocated to the partial loads according to the optimized strategy. In most scenarios, the addition of H2 is associated with a reduction in emissions compared to conventional fossil fuel operation. The greatest leverage of H2 admixture in reducing the environmental footprint is found when applied from the lowest load up, thus assisting in the start-up and shut-down process.</description>

      <title>Is Hydrogen Viable as Alternative Fuel for Heavy-Duty Vehicles Based on Internal Combustion Engines?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202408.2006.v1</link>
      <description>Arianna Baldinelli, Marco Francesconi, Marco Antonelli, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402076020

                Hydrogen mobility embodies a promising solution to address the challenges posed by traditional fossil-fuel-based vehicles. The use of hydrogen in small heavy duty road vehicles based on internal combustion engines (ICEs) may be appealing for two fundamental reasons: direct electrification seems less promising in heavy duty transport systems and fuel cell-based hydrogen vehicles implementation may not proceed at the expected pace due to higher investment costs compared to ICEs. On the other hand, hydrogen combustion is gaining attractiveness and relies on robust and cheap technologies, but it is not the only renewable solution. In this framework, this work presents a methodology to assess Weel-to-Whell primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions of small heavy-duty vehicles. The methodology is applied in a real case-study, namely a passenger coach travelling on a 100 km-mission in non-optimized conditions. Therefore, the suitability of hydrogen is compared with standard diesel and other alternative diesel-type fuels (biodiesel and synthetic diesel types). Hydrogen shows competitivity with standard diesel from the point of view of CO2 emission reduction (-29%) while it hides a higher primary energy consumption (+40%). Nonetheless, HVO brings the highest benefits both from the point of view of primary energy consumption and emission reduction, namely -35% and 464-634 kgCO2/100km avoided compared to hydrogen.</description>

                Acidic CO2 electrolysis offers a promising strategy to achieve high carbon utilization and high energy efficiency. However, challenges remain in suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improving product selectivity. High concentrations of potassium ions (K+) can suppress HER and accelerate CO2 reduction, but they still inevitably suffer from salt precipitation problems. In this study, we demonstrate that the sulfonate&#8208;based polyelectrolyte, polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), enables to reconstruct the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface to significantly enhance the acidic CO2 electrolysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that PSS induces high local K+ concentrations through electrostatic interaction between PSS anions and K+. In situ spectroscopy reveals that PSS reshapes the interfacial hydrogen&#8211;bond (H&#8211;bond) network, which is attributed to the H&#8211;bonds between PSS anions and hydrated proton as well as the steric hindrance of the additive molecules. This greatly weakens proton transfer kinetics and leads to the suppression of undesirable HER. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of 93.9% for CO can be achieved at 250 mA cm&#8211;2, simultaneous with a high single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 72.2% on commercial Ag catalysts in acid. This study highlights the important role of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface induced by polyelectrolyte additives in promoting electrocatalytic reactions.</description>

      <title>Thunderstorm&#8208;related respiratory symptoms: An old story with a new ending?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/all.16308</link>
      <description>Francis Thien, Isabella Annesi&#8208;Maesano, Gennaro D&#8217;Amato, Allergy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402136228

                On November 21, 2016, the world was shaken by a catastrophic epidemic thunderstorm asthma event which overtook the Melbourne, a city of over 5 million people in south-eastern Australia. Following heavy early seasonal spring rains which allowed a lush growth of vegetation, a 10 day long hot dry spell in late spring was broken by a cool change and thunderstorms crossing over the city at 6 pm. A large proportion of the unsuspecting population was mainly outdoors, enjoying the beaches to cool off, or commuting on the way home from work. Within hours, hospital emergency departments were inundated as thousands of people presented with symptoms of respiratory distress and ambulances were overwhelmed with distress calls for help. The official figures of 3365 excess public hospital emergency department presentations with respiratory-related cases and 476 excess asthma-related hospital admissions (a 7-fold and 10-fold increase above average respectively) underestimate the thousands of others who presented to general practitioners and community pharmacies seeking relief.1 This dramatic event brought into sharp relief the story of thunderstorm-related respiratory symptoms which have been described globally now for over 40 years. Initially reported in the United Kingdom in 1983, dozens of events have been reported in diverse geographical regions including Canada, USA, Italy, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Northern China, Australia and New Zealand.2 The Melbourne 2016 event was the deadliest by far with 10 fatalities, with 5 fatalities reported subsequently in Kuwait in 2016, and previously reported events (in UK and Australia) with single fatalities (Table 1). What have we learnt and how can we be better prepared to prevent or mitigate the risk of future events? These thunderstorm respiratory events arise from a common complex interaction of environmental and individual susceptibility factors. Main environmental factors include high concentrations of an aeroallergen and the presence of thunderstorms. Allergens which have been described include various mould species (Didymella exitalis, Myxomycetes and Alternaria sp.), weed (Parietaria/Urticaceae sp. and Amaranthaceae sp.), mugwort (Artemisia sp.), olive tree (Olea europaea) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne) pollens.3 Thunderstorm characteristics include outflows with colder air associated with the down draft from the thunderstorm, sweeping up pollen grains and particles and then concentrating them in a shallow band of air bringing atmospheric aeroallergens to ground level. For ryegrass pollen triggered events, evidence suggests thunderstorm moisture and rainwater ruptures ryegrass pollen grains by osmotic shock, releasing fine (&lt;2.5 &#956;m) allergen-bearing starch-granules respirable to the lower airways. This allows bypass of the usual upper airway filter and trigger acute bronchospasm via a putative direct lower airway allergen challenge, even in those not previously known to be asthmatic. Individual risk factors include prior allergen sensitization and exposure, with the presence of rhinitis being both a marker of allergic sensitization as well as a risk factor for latent and undiagnosed asthma. In those with diagnosed current asthma, low adherence to preventive inhaled steroids increases thunderstorm asthma risk. Other factors more recently identified include Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score &gt;1.5, ryegrass pollen specific IgE &gt; 10.1 kU/L, raised eosinophil counts, and raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level.4 The effect of climate change on allergenic pollen and weather patterns and their impact on health and healthcare services is a burgeoning area of concern. Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and temperatures have important effects on plants, their pollen production, and the consequent burden of atmospheric allergens.5 Seasonal variations and increases in temperature affect the timing of the pollen season for some plants, including starting pollen release earlier and lasting longer. In addition, significant increases in pollen allergenicity have been reported as associated with increasing CO2 and temperature. Climate change can also increase the likelihood of extreme weather events, such as thunderstorms and unseasonal rainfall promoting luxuriant plant growth, alternating with hot dry spells promoting pollen release.5 Air pollution that is also influenced by climate change significantly exacerbates the risk and severity of thunderstorm asthma by interacting with pollen, enhancing respiratory sensitivity, and contributing to a pro-inflammatory state in the lungs.2 Understanding this relationship is crucial for preventing and managing thunderstorm asthma, particularly in urban areas where pollution levels are high. Improved understanding of these risk factors for thunderstorm asthma leads to consideration of the following preventive strategies at the individual, public health and environmental level. For individuals with asthma, access and adherence to an inhaled steroid/fast onset long-acting bronchodilator (ICS/LABA) medication (such as a budesonide and formoterol combination inhaler) during the pollen season should be promoted. Those with allergic rhinitis need to be treated with preventive therapy such as intranasal steroids, with consideration of, and access to ICS/LABA inhalers especially if there are any respiratory symptoms suggestive of latent or undiagnosed asthma. Allergen specific immunotherapy (if available) can also be considered as primary or secondary preventive risk reduction strategies.6 At the public health level, pollen monitoring can facilitate pollen forecasting and warning systems, to allow pollen sensitive individuals to stay indoors and avoid exposure to harmful pollen levels. In the Australian state of Victoria, following the Melbourne 2016 event, a thunderstorm asthma forecasting system during the pollen season has been implemented which combines meteorological and grass pollen forecasts to produce daily forecasts of low, moderate, or high thunderstorm asthma risk. During high-risk days with high airborne pollen concentrations (&gt;50 pollen grains/m3) and severe thunderstorms with strong winds, public health messages are promoted through public and social media to stay indoors, and for those at risk with asthma and allergic rhinitis to have available and take their inhaled/intranasal medication. Health services are also put on alert for thunderstorm asthma outbreak response preparedness. These strategies need to be tailored for particular geographical regions' health system resources and thunderstorm asthma risk profile (Figure 1). Lastly, climate change is a global health concern at multiple levels. There is an urgent need to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change on human health. Emissions reduction and air quality improvement (through reducing fossil fuel use and increasing environmental biodiversity and green spaces) and promoting sustainable agricultural practices will help to reduce the impact of climate change.7 The paradigm and catastrophic potential of epidemic thunderstorm asthma emphasises the need to take urgent action in order to write a new ending to an old story.

      <title>Characteristics of PM2.5 and CO2 Concentrations in Typical Functional Areas of a University Campus in Beijing Based on Low-Cost Sensor Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos15091044</link>

                The air quality in educational campuses affects the health and work efficiency of teachers and students. Studies into this matter are of great significance for optimizing the management of campus living environments. Low-cost online sensors to monitor PM2.5 and CO2 levels were used in typical functional areas of a university campus in Beijing, China, including offices, dormitories, leisure spaces, canteens, and laboratories. By comparing the findings with data from nearby national monitoring stations, the seasonal and spatial variations in PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations were analyzed. Findings indicate PM2.5 levels within the campus were notably lower compared to the surrounding urban environment. There was variation in PM2.5 and CO2 concentrations across different functional areas. Typically, indoor PM2.5 levels were lower than outdoor ones, while CO2 concentrations in enclosed indoor spaces with human activities progressively escalated. The main internal emission sources affecting the PM2.5 level on campus included traffic emissions, dust generated by human activities, and emissions from catering. In contrast, in areas with better green coverage or where a lake system participates in the atmospheric circulation, the PM2.5 level and CO2/PM2.5 were lower. This indicates that the cleansing impact of plants and aquatic systems is instrumental in lowering PM2.5 concentrations, offering healthier leisure spaces. Seasonal variations also impact PM2.5 levels. During the non-heating period, less pollution source emissions led to decreased outdoor PM2.5 concentrations. The campus monitoring sites experienced an approximate 5 &#181;g/m3 and 29 &#181;g/m3 reduction in the average PM2.5 levels as compared to the PM2.5 of the surrounding urban environment, respectively, during the non-heating and heating period. During indoor activities or sleep, CO2 levels can build up to as high as 2303 ppm due to breathing. It is advisable to stay indoors on days when pollution levels are high, whereas on days with clean air, it is healthier to be outdoors or to air out indoor areas by opening windows. Our research provides clearer scientific evidence for incorporating behavioral strategies for improving air quality into both daily work and life. Moreover, the findings are quite meaningful for the widespread adoption of low-cost sensor monitoring in various environments, with applications beyond just the campus settings.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Mechanical, Ecological, Economical, and Thermal Characteristics of Geopolymer Concrete Containing Processed Slag Sand</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16177402</link>

                This manuscript highlights the mechanical, economical, ecological, and thermal investigations performed on paving quality geopolymer concrete (PQGC) incorporating processed steel slag (PSS) as a substitute for river sand (RSa). The replacement of RSa with PSS ranged from 0 to 100% in the PQGC mix. The mix with 100% PSS content exhibited enhanced geopolymerization, resulting in a denser and more amorphous matrix. This improved the mechanical properties, increasing compressive strength by 10.9%, flexural strength by 23.5%, and splitting tensile strength by 8.3%. The replacement of RSa with PSS in PQGC led to a marginal reduction in (embodied energy) EE and CO2 emissions. However, compared to conventional Pavement Quality Concrete (PQC) and Fly Ash PQC (FPQC), the reduction in EE for PQGC was 44% and 34%, while the CO2 emissions of PQGC were reduced by 1.22 and 1.49 times. Despite these benefits, PQGC with 100% PSS was 19% and 30% more expensive than PQC and FPQC, respectively. The Global Warming Potential (GWP) of PQGC was approximately one-third that of PQC and FPQC at all levels of replacement of RSa in PQGC when compared to PQC and FPQC. Additionally, thermal conductivity decreased from k = 0.67 W/m &#176;C to k = 0.51 W/m &#176;C with 100% replacement of RSa, keeping the concrete cooler. Therefore, PQGC with 100% PSS, when practically implemented, may help reduce surrounding temperatures. This study concludes that PSS is a feasible and reliable alternative to RSa, enhancing the sustainability of PQGC.</description>

                Large-scale cattle farming currently accounts for only 30% of the industry in China, where significant variation in farm sizes and distributions poses challenges to sustainable manure management. Moreover, substantial gaps exist in research on the environmental impacts of manure treatment technologies across different farm scales. The environmental and economic performances of eight different cattle manure management techniques, including six aerobic, three anaerobic, and integrated methods, were evaluated for small, medium, and large cattle farms using life cycle assessment and life cycle cost methods. The results indicate that the black membrane biogas pool (BMBP) offers the best environmental and economic benefits, reducing the global warming potential (GWP) by 101.3% and enhancing the profit by at least 148.7 CNY per ton of dry cattle manure. Significant disparities in cattle farming scale and manure production across provinces necessitate region-specific policies. The GWP from national cattle manure management stands at about 1.3 million tons of CO2 equiv, with major inputs from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Inner Mongolia, comprising 25.2% of the total. Increasing the utilization rate of cattle manure from 80% to 90% by 2025 could reduce the GWP by 11.0%. Advancing the BMBP and shifting 5% of aerobic to anaerobic processes could reduce carbon emissions by 0.2 million tons of CO2 equiv and other pollutants by 1.1&#8211;23.4%. Therefore, enhancing anaerobic technology and boosting utilization rates promise more efficient and synergistic reductions in CO2 emissions and other pollutants.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction in Acidic Electrolytes: Spectroscopic Evidence for Local pH Gradients</title>

                Inspired by recent advances in electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) under acidic conditions, herein we leverage in situ spectroscopy to inform the optimization of CO2R at low pH. Using attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS) and fluorescent confocal laser scanning microscopy, we investigate the role that alkali cations (M+) play on electrochemical CO2R. This study hence provides important information related to the local electrode surface pH under bulk acidic conditions for CO2R, both in the presence and absence of an organic film layer, at variable [M+]. We show that in an acidic electrolyte, an appropriate current density can enable CO2R in the absence of metal cations. In situ local pH measurements suggest the local [H+] must be sufficiently depleted to promote H2O reduction as the competing reaction with CO2R. Incrementally incorporating [K+] leads to increases in the local pH that promotes CO2R but only at proton consumption rates sufficient to drive the pH up dramatically. Stark tuning measurements and analysis of surface water structure reveal no change in the electric field with [M+] and a desorption of interfacial water, indicating that improved CO2R performance is driven by suppression of H+ mass transport and modification of the interfacial solvation structure. In situ pH measurements confirm increasing local pH, and therefore decreased local [CO2], with [M+], motivating alternate means of modulating proton transport. We show that an organic film formed via in situ electrodeposition of an organic additive provides a means to achieve selective CO2R (FECO2R &#8764; 65%) over hydrogen evolution reaction in the presence of strong acid (pH 1) and low cation concentrations (&#8804;0.1 M) at both low and high current densities.</description>

      <title>CO2-Based Power Cycles: What Effect Does Additive Molecular Complexity Have on the Cycle Layout?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/gt2024-128133</link>
      <description>Omar Aqel, Martin T. White, A. I. Sayma, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401941401

                Abstract Since their inception, CO2 power cycles have gained prominence for their superior performance and compactness. However, the efficiency of the simple supercritical CO2 cycle is hindered by relatively large temperature differences in the recuperator, leading to increased exergy destruction. Although complex cycles like the recompression or precompression cycles can reduce recuperator irreversibility, their higher complexity and additional equipment requirements raise the cost of the power plant. This paper aims to demonstrate that recuperator irreversibility in a simple recuperated transcritical cycle can be alleviated using CO2-based mixtures, without resorting to complex cycles. This is achieved by comparing the efficiencies of simple and recompression cycles using CO2-based mixtures with nine additives of various molecular complexities: H2S, SO2, C3H8, C4H10, C5H12, C6H6, C4H4S, TiCl4, and C6F6. The effect of additive molar fraction (ranging from 0.05 to 0.5) on the efficiency of both cycles is examined. Thermal efficiency optimisation reveals a correlation between the efficiency difference of the simple and recompression cycles and the molecular complexity of the working fluid. The reduction in recuperator irreversibility is attributed to the decrease in the difference in the isobaric specific heat capacities between the streams in the recuperator with the use of complex additives. Consequently, the advantage of a recompression cycle diminishes as the aggregate molecular complexity of the working fluid increases. Simple additives like H2S, SO2, and C3H8 result in recompression cycles outperforming simple recuperated cycles by 4% to 8% in terms of absolute thermal efficiency, depending on the additive and its molar fraction. Conversely, more complex additives like C4H4S, TiCl4, and C6F6, exhibit thermal efficiencies in simple recuperated cycles comparable to those of recompression cycles. The additive molar fraction at which both cycles achieve similar performances depends on the molecular complexity of the additive; the more complex the additive, the lower the additive molar fraction required to create a complex working fluid. Moreover, the split fraction in recompression cycles exhibits a similar correlation with molecular complexity as observed in the efficiency difference, suggesting that recompression cycles will morph into simple recuperated cycles as molecular complexity increases. In conclusion, the use of additives provides an additional dimension through which the efficiency of CO2 cycles can be optimised, enabling improved performance without the need for complex cycles.</description>

      <title>MECHANICAL IMPACTS OF COMPLETE AGGREGATE SUBSTITUTION IN ALKALI ACTIVATED CONCRETE PAVEMENT</title>

                There are environmental impacts associated with the construction of necessary infrastructures. Concrete is the most used construction material. To reduce the environmental impact of construction, we can use alternatives to Portland cement and recycled aggregates in concrete production. This study used non-reactive electric arc furnace slag (EAFS) and alkali-activated concrete (AASC). The goal was to reduce CO2 emissions while maintaining desired mechanical and durability properties. Tests showed that the mix designs had excellent properties. Full substitution of aggregates resulted in compressive strength of 47 MPa at 28 days, but a 6% reduction compared to AASC with natural aggregates. This pattern is repeated for other mechanical properties. Substituting all aggregates led to a 30% reduction in water absorption performance compared to AASC with natural aggregates. Choosing sustainable and eco-friendly concrete types can reduce a structure's environmental impact and carbon footprint. This is crucial for a more sustainable future.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Review of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS): Technological Advances, Environmental Impact, and Economic Feasibility</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.36347/sajb.2024.v12i07.003</link>

                Carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) technologies are critical to reducing CO2 exhalations on a global scale. This review study synthesizes the many elements of CCUS over 50 years, from R&amp;D to deployment scales, in terms of their mitigation potential for global emission reductions. Next, it discusses existing and new carbon capture techniques from an automation standpoint (e.g., pre-combustion capture, post-combustion capture combustion), as well as the economic feasibility of CCUS regionally in terms of capital retail price, operating expenses, and value in the form of potential revenue streams based on CO2, aided by significant range-scaling building blocks such as rising nation. Each technique is thoroughly evaluated in terms of its environmental impact and associated risks, and case studies are used to illustrate practical lessons learnt. The paper also discusses the arguments around what future advances may exist in CCUS technology, and opportunities to scale these up (including research needs for this support), drawing lessons past policy. The findings underscore the importance of integrating CCUS into broader climate strategies to achieve net-zero exhalations while addressing the economic and environmental challenges that remain.</description>

      <title>STUDYING HOW DIESEL ENGINE ADDITIVES USING SILVER OXIDE (Ag2O) NANOPARTICLES AFFECT THE ENVIRONMENT</title>

                Abstract: Biodiesel has been defined as an alternative fuel that has the potential to be used instead of diesel fuel for years. In case of complete combustion reaction in engines, the products released do not directly threaten human health. Compared to diesel fuel, biodiesel has worse combustion performance due to some fuel properties. Therefore, incomplete combustion products such as hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), smoke emission and complete combustion products such as CO2 are thrown into the atmosphere. In this study, the changes in exhaust emissions of 50 ppm and 75 ppm Ag2O NPs were experimentally examined to improve the adverse combustion performance and emission characteristics of cottonseed oil methyl ester. In experiments, nano additive improved the thermal conductivity, mass dissipation and heat transfer of the test fuels, and resulted in reducing of CO emissions as it provided a higher oxidation rate of hydrocarbon molecules. Due to the improvement in the combustion reaction, CO2 emission increased with product of complete combustion. The increase in CO2 emissions was 3.17% and 3.97% for CAg-50 and CAg-75 fuels, respectively, when compared to C0 fuel at 40 Nm load. The NPs additive increased the lower calorific value of the fuel and cylinder temperature. This situation caused increase of NOx emissions by 3.69% and 7.47% CAg-50 and CAg-75 fuels 40 Nm load. Adding of NPs in base fuel reduced to viscosity and density provided better atomization. So a reduction in smoke emission was obtained with NPs addition by 35.09% and 47.32% in CAg-50 and CAg-75 fuels, respectively, compared to C0 fuel at 10 Nm load, while 7.45% and 19.43% at 40 Nm load.</description>

                The carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) contents within a plant are determined from biomass samples collected following the USDA LTAR Common Experiment measurement: Aboveground biomass protocol. Biomass C and N measurements are critical for developing C and N balances and associated stocks and flows within agroecosystems. For these purposes, the biomass that stays in or leaves the field should undergo analysis for C and N. In addition, ratios of plant biomass C to other nutrients (including N) are valuable for 1) assessing physiological allocation of photosynthate and nutrients and residue quality and 2) defining boundaries of plant growth/physiology, stress response, and production potential and quality for modeling efforts. The recommended method for determining C and N tissue concentrations is high-temperature combustion, which involves high-temperature oxidation (&gt;1000&#176;C) of a sample in the presence of oxygen, reduction of nitrogen compounds to N2 in a downstream reduction furnace, and measurement of the resulting CO2 and N2 by infrared gas analysis or gas chromatography.</description>

                Abstract Aviation is widely recognized as a significant source of air pollutant emissions, encompassing gaseous products such as CO2, CO, NOx, and particulate matter (PM), especially in the form of soot. This study conducted comprehensive emission measurements on an Allison 250 C20B turboshaft engine to investigate sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) impact on emissions. Two conventional Jet A-1 fuel blends with 30% and 50% HEFA-SPK synthesized paraffinic kerosene derived from hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) content together with 100% HEFA-SPK were tested regarding their emissions and compared against neat Jet A-1. The study&#8217;s primary focus was quantifying ultrafine particulate matter in terms of number and size. The selection of distinct engine power settings was based on the thrust ratios specified in the International Civil Aviation Organization&#8217;s (ICAO) Landing and Take-off-cycle (LTO-cycle). PM emissions were characterized using multiple measurement techniques. These included the application of two distinct electrical mobility analyzers. An additional concentration particle counter (CPC) was utilized to underscore the reliability of the findings. A standard FTIR/O2/FID system was used to assess gaseous emissions, a well-established method for measuring fundamental combustion products such as CO2, CO, unburned hydrocarbons (UHC&#8217;s) and NOx. The particle measurement systems revealed a decrease in both the number and size of particles with increasing HEFA-SPK content. This decrease in particle number appeared linear for the 30% and 50% HEFA-SPK blends and was more pronounced for the 100% HEFA-SPK. Furthermore, a more substantial reduction in PM emissions, reaching up to 82%, was observed at lower load settings, such as Ground Idle (GI), compared to higher load settings like Take-Off (TO), where the reduction was up to 40%. Results of the gaseous emissions are also presented in the study.</description>

      <title>On&#8208;purpose production of light olefins through oxidative dehydrogenation: An overview of recent developments</title>

                Products made from light olefins play an important role in our daily lives. Traditional light olefins production based on stream crackers and fluid catalytic cracking suffer from high energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Thereby, the continually increasing demand of light olefins needs to be met through more environmentally sustainable procedures. On&#8208;purpose production routes are a preferred choice among petrochemicals manufacturers, being energy efficient and having lower carbon footprint. Among them, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light olefins is a thermodynamically favourable exothermic process as compared to non&#8208;oxidative routes. They can be operated at lower temperatures and has low coke deposition on catalyst, thereby resisting rapid catalyst deactivation. Herein, we have analysed various catalytic systems utilised in the oxidative dehydrogenation process. We have reviewed role of support, chemical composition of catalyst, presence of dopant, oxidation state of active metal, controlled surface modification by oxidative and reductive pretreatments, and reaction factors for each system. The performance of various catalytic systems for ODH of ethane, propane and butane in the presence of O2, CO2, N2O and special oxidants have been reviewed. A short critical overview on emerging on&#8208;purpose routes for the production of renewable 1,3 butadiene has also been discussed.</description>

      <title>Retrofit of a Marine Engine to Dual-Fuel Methane&#8211;Diesel: Experimental Analysis of Performance and Exhaust Emission with Continuous and Phased Methane Injection Systems</title>

                Shipping is a highly energy-intensive sector, and fleet decarbonization initiatives can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In the short-to-medium term, internal combustion engines will continue to be used for propulsion or as electricity generators onboard ships. Natural gas is an effective solution which can be used to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from the marine sector. Considered to be a transitional fuel, it can provide a potential reduction in CO2 emissions of around 20&#8211;30%, compared with conventional marine fuels. This work investigated the influence of diesel-injection strategies on the performance and emissions of a single-cylinder prototype compression-ignition engine for marine applications, retrofitted to run as a Low-Pressure Dual-Fuel Engine using natural gas. Two different injection systems were used: a mass flow controller enabling continuous-mode gas feeding, and a Solenoid-Operated Gas Admission Valve for marine applications, the latter allowing phased natural-gas injection. Experimental tests were focused on partial-load conditions, which are critical for dual-fuel engines, with a natural gas/diesel mass ratio of 4:1. Phased injection resulted in reductions in fuel consumption, compared to continuous mode, of up to 11%. Further experiments demonstrated reductions in fuel consumption of up to 20.7% (in equivalent diesel); on the other hand, the unburned hydrocarbon emissions which resulted were an order of magnitude larger than the reference values for full diesel, reducing the benefits in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, with a reduction in Global Warming Potential of only 3% compared to full diesel.</description>

                Chemical looping (CL)-based oxidative dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) of ethane (C2H6) and successive CO2 activation to form CO were investigated on FeMTiOx catalysts (M = Ni, Sn, Co, Mn, Ce metal oxide), and a proper reduction extent of active metal oxides was found to be well correlated with C2H6 conversion as well as the amount of oxidized COx formation during the C2H6 activation step. The easily reducible FeCeTiOx showed a higher C2H6 conversion of 19.6% and an ethylene (C2H4) selectivity of 73.4% due to the higher redox property of the CeO2 promoter, which also showed a higher CO2 activation to CO with its productivity of 0.130 mmol/g due to the presence of abundant oxygen vacant sites with smaller crystallite sizes of active metal oxides. The fast oxygen transfer rate and thermal stability of Ce-incorporated FeTiOx were responsible for an enhanced ethylene productivity. The newly formed MnTiO3 phases with coexisting FeTiO3 phases on FeMnTiOx were found to be active sites for the CL-ODH reaction due to an increased number of stable lattice oxygens with the highest C2H4 selectivity of 80%. However, easy reducibility and facile aggregation of NiO and Co3O4 phases on FeNiTiOx and FeCoTiOx revealed a higher selectivity to COx in the range of 18.3&#8211;18.9% compared to the optimal FeCeTiOx with a lower COx selectivity of 14.4%. The lower C2H6 conversion on FeSnTiOx was also attributed to the suppressed redox properties of active metal oxides.</description>

      <title>How Clean Can We Get? Technological Change and Renewable Energy Use in Mexico, A General Equilibrium Perspective</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.56476/jed.v49i1.11</link>
      <description>Roy Boyd, Alejandra Elizondo, Mar&#237;a Eugenia Ibarrar&#225;n Viniegra, No host. 49(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402184427

                This study explores the impact of technological change and renewable energy adoption on Mexico's economy using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. As global concerns about climate change intensify, reducing carbon emissions has become a priority, but traditional CGE models often predict significant economic costs associated with fossil fuel restrictions. In this analysis, we modify the conventional CGE framework to incorporate increasing returns to scale and endogenously modeled technological change, reflecting the real-world diffusion of renewable energy technologies in developing countries like Mexico. By accounting for these factors, our model demonstrates that a combined policy of carbon taxation and renewable energy subsidies can achieve significant CO2 reductions without negatively impacting economic welfare. However, while the environmental benefits&#8212;such as reduced emissions of particulates, SO2, and NOx&#8212;are substantial, the overall welfare gains remain modest, and the policy's success depends on effective government implementation and potential trade impacts. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers in Mexico and other developing nations seeking to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability through strategic carbon emission reduction policies.</description>

      <title>Challenges in the Production of Fuel Cells for Aviation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/gt2024-125888</link>
      <description>P Sperling, Rainer Horstkotte, Jan Sommer, Sascha Gierlings, Henning Janssen, T. Herrig, Thomas Bergs, Christian Brecher, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401941641

                Abstract The influence of increasing resource scarcity and climate change has a significant impact on aviation. Therefore, the European Commission has set ambitious goals with a 75 % reduction in CO2 and a 90 % reduction in NOX as part of the Flightpath 2050 vision. Achieving these goals requires the use of disruptive technologies in aviation, especially in propulsion. In addition to the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the use of hydrogen is a promising alternative. There is the possibility of using a fuel cell which acts as an energy converter and powers the primary electric drives, offering the potential to fly emission-free, especially for short- and medium-range flights. However, successful integration of the fuel cell into the aircraft&#8217;s powertrain requires a significantly increased gravimetric power density compared to the status quo. Furthermore, the fuel cell and the entire manufacturing process chain must fulfill the stringent safety requirements of aviation. Therefore, the bipolar plate and, respectively, its production process are key elements for the fuel cell. This paper describes how to establish a basis for the production of the bipolar plate in accordance with aviation requirements.

      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17174363</link>
      <description>Peng Yu, Yufeng Xu, Honghua Liu, Xinyu Liu, Jiani Fu, Meijun Xu, Debao Zhou, Energies. 17(17)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402127745

                Shallow geothermal energy (SGE) is a widely prevalent geological resource underground, and its utilization offer significant energy conservation and emission reduction benefits, contributing to the achievement of carbon neutrality goals. Assessing the development potential of regional SGE can ensure sustainable development of these resources and prevent adverse effects induced by overexploitation. Jiangsu Province, a developed region in the eastern coastal area of China, has a strong demand for cooling and heating in urban buildings. The primary form of utilizing SGE in this area is through vertical ground source heat pumps (VGSHP). Based on the analysis of the impact of regional geological conditions on the development of SGE, this study specifically evaluated the suitability of developing SGE through VGSHP. After excluding areas unsuitable for development, the heat exchange capacity, heating or cooling area per unit area, and energy conservation and emission reduction benefits of VGSHP were calculated. The results indicate that the area suitable and moderately suitable for developing SGE through VGSHP in Jiangsu Province amounts to 76,453 km2. The total heat exchange capacity for summer is 1.21 &#215; 109 kW, which can provide cooling for an area of 1.21 &#215; 1010 m2. The total heat exchange capacity for winter is 8.70 &#215; 108 kW, which can provide heating for an area of 1.09 &#215; 1010 m2. The annual available resource amount is 2.68 &#215; 1012 kWh, equivalent to 3.30 &#215; 108 tons of standard coal, and a CO2 reduction of 7.86 &#215; 108 tons.</description>

                Abstract Gas Turbines will need to reduce CO2 emissions and prove their flexibility based on market needs and new proposed rules [2]. Economically, utilizing existing gas turbine assets to meet these requirements will be of great benefit as compared to building new turbines. Even better, determining the lowest cost least intrusive upgrades required is of great interest to power producers. The demonstration described here was conducted on one (1) GT unit at the Constellation Hillabee power plant (Siemens Energy SGT6-6000G 2x1 configuration) which doubled the mass flow of hydrogen of previous record-breaking DLN demonstrations. The testing was done on an unaltered, existing GT asset, which provides great value for those GTs which are already providing power using natural gas. The demonstrated hydrogen blending percentage of 38.8% (resulting in approximately 18% reduction in CO2 emissions) proved the system capable of meeting the first BSER goals set forth in recent proposed US EPA gas turbine rules. Such demonstrations are of critical importance as they show the inherent capability to meet reduced carbon power generation requirements without more significant cost outlays. This report documents the evaluation, preparation, execution, and results from this demonstration testing. The results are provided for the gas turbine community to use as insight into the capability and flexibility of existing assets to meet the future demands of reduced carbon power generation. Specific information around safety, reliability, emissions, and operability are discussed to provide context around existing asset capability.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic Comparative Assessment of High Temperature Heat Pump Architectures for Industrial Pumped Thermal Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/gt2024-128910</link>
      <description>Silvia Trevisan, Bjarke Buchbjerg, Arne H&#248;eg, Rafael Gu&#233;dez, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401941946

                Abstract The industrial sector is a key global source of wealth, but it is also recognized as a major challenge toward worldwide decarbonization. Today the industrial sector requires more than 22 % of the global energy demand as thermal energy and produces for this about 40 % of the total CO2 emissions. Solutions to efficiently decarbonize the industrial sector are deemed. This work presents a comparative techno-economic performance assessment of a high temperature heat pump integration within a molten salts based power to heat system for industrial heat flexible generation. The main system performance is reported in terms of required working conditions and temperature for the heat pump and thermal demand size as well as reduction of the attainable levelized cost of heat (LCoH) against non-flexible electric boiler based systems. The impact of different industrial load profiles, electricity prices, heat pump capital cost and heat pump real to Carnot efficiency ratio are also presented. The results highlight that the proposed system can be cost-competitive, particularly for thermal demand around 10 MW and waste heat temperatures above 80&#176;C. Under these conditions LCoH reduction higher than 15 %, with respect to the considered non-flexible electric boiler alternative, are attainable. These LCoH reductions are primarily driven by savings in electrical consumption as high as 30 %. This study sets the ground for further power-to-heat techno-economic investigations addressing different industrial sectors and identifies main system and components design strategies, integrations, and targets.</description>

      <title>Emissions Comparison of 100% SAF With Bio-Aromatics and Conventional (Fossil) Jet Fuel</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/gt2024-124002</link>
      <description>Jean-Baptiste Jarin, Jean-Louis Champion-R&#233;aud, Reetu Sallinen, Edgar Steenwinkel, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401980895

                Abstract It is recognized that Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) will play a significant role in the decarbonization of air mobility and various pathways and feedstocks are considered for their production. This may lead to differences in chemical and physical properties when compared to conventional, fossil, aviation fuel (CAF). SAF available today are blended with CAF and after blending they are compliant with the Jet Fuel norm (ASTM1655). But the goal of achieving 100% SAF could be problematic, as the absence of aromatics, one of the characteristics of SAF produced today, could lead to leaks in the seal. Adding renewable aromatics (Synthesized Aromatic Kerosene, or SAK) to the SAF is therefore seen as an opportunity to reach 100% SAF without impacting the aircraft and airport&#8217;s fuel infrastructures, potentially enabling a faster decarbonization of the sector. In this study, we have compared the emissions of a 100% SAF which contains 9% of SAK issued from the biomass (SAF-SPK/A) with a CAF. Performance and behavior: The tests did not identify any performance differences between the two fuels, including turbine reactivity and equipment degradation. This was later confirmed by Bell Helicopter during an experimental test flight campaign. Emissions: the lower CO2 impact is mainly due to the life cycle analysis of the SAF, but the test also showed reduced CO2 emissions during the combustion. While NO and NOx were found equivalent, significant reduction in CO and soot (Smoke Number, SN) were measured: &#8722;20 to &#8722;50% depending on the mass fuel flow. These improvements could be explained by the lower content of aromatics as well as the nature of these aromatics and this will be further investigated in future studies.</description>

                The development of novel materials based on renewable materials with beneficial properties that assist with energy efficiency and conservation has been encouraged by increasing consciousness of environmental issues. This research intends to use sustainable cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) obtained from oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) as reinforcement to enhance the properties of rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF). RPUF reinforcement with varied CNC concentrations (0.25&#8211;1 wt%) was examined by foaming behavior, surface morphology, mechanical properties, thermal insulation properties, dimensional stability, efficiency energy study, and CO2 reduction through their thermal conductivity values. The results achieved an optimal improvement of mechanical properties of the RPUF composite by around 23.53% compared to RPUF control, at the addition of 0.5 wt% of CNC concentration while maintaining the density of 37&#8211;39 kg/m3. Further, incorporating CNC improved thermal insulating performance by 9.95%, as reflected by decreased thermal conductivity from 0.0292 W/mK to 0.0269 W/mK and decreased cell size by 28.12%. Finally, based on the energy and cost efficiency studies, RPUF-CNC composites offer up to 0.78 kWh/m2 and 0.031 kWh/m2 compared to conventional wall materials made of concrete and wood, respectively. Furthermore, it contributed to reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 110 and 7.2 kg CO2/year compared to concrete and wood, respectively. This work demonstrates the promising use of eco-friendly building insulation materials to mitigate the energy and environmental crisis.</description>

                To enhance sustainability in the construction sector and reduce CO2 emissions, low-binder concretes arise as an alternative. In this scenario, the use of limestone filler as cement replacement, which is available in a large scale, becomes a suitable alternative. This study evaluates the impact of replacing 30% and 60% of Portland cement by limestone filler on compressive strength, chlorides transport and corrosion propagation in concrete mixtures. The findings reveal that the concretes with low binder contents meet the minimum compressive strength for concrete structures recommended by Brazilian standard. Nevertheless, the reduction in Portland cement content promoted a lower concrete pH and decreased C3A content. This led to higher diffusion coefficients but did not mean a higher content of chlorides accumulated into concrete for C250, which means that, chloride diffusion coefficient needs to be analysed together with other variables and that the performance of low-binder content concretes can be equivalent or even superior in some properties.</description>

                Ensuring food security with limited farm resources under a climate change scenario is a major challenge for agricultural scientists. Conventional farming uses ample fertilizers and pesticides for crop production, which badly impacts the environment. The key to sustainable agriculture is finding ways to boost productivity with sustainability. This chapter focuses on the importance of crop rotations for achieving the said goal by highlighted several benefits of implementing diversified crop rotations, including the conversion of atmospheric CO2 into plant biomass, improving system (pests, diseases, weed infestations, and abiotic and biotic stress) resilience, and enhancing water and fertilizer use efficiencies. Furthermore, legume-based crop rotations also benefit a significant reduction in the use of synthetic fertilizers and augment the sustainability of the agricultural production system. Thus, cropping rotation has become indispensable to transform agriculture and pave the way for a more sustainable future.</description>

      <title>Gas Turbine Combined Cycle System Integration with Carbon Capture Plant for Improved Value</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/gt2024-124227</link>
      <description>Majed Sammak, R.N. Smith, Parag Kulkarni, N. Ravi, J. E. Sholes, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401941941

                Abstract The aim of this study is to analyze methodologies that can reduce performance impact on natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plant when integrated with carbon capture plant (CCP) and lower the capital expenditure (CapEX) associated with carbon capture. The conventional approach of providing steam to the carbon capture reboiler for CO2 regeneration is the use of a bolt-on system, which entails an external auxiliary boiler. The study presented four promising technologies that can enhance the integration of NGCC with CCP: steam integration, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), gas turbine improvement, and enhanced control system. The paper analyzes how EGR can decrease CCP CapEX and footprint, focusing on equipment with the most significant CapEX reductions. The steam integration approach refers to extracting steam from various locations in the steam cycle such as the crossover between the intermediate pressure (IP) and low pressure (LP) sections of the steam turbine using a throttle and control valve. The EGR method refers to recirculating a part of the flue gas from the stack back into the gas turbine inlet, where it is combined with ambient air. The analysis reveals that EGR contributes to an increase in the concentration of CO2 in exhaust while simultaneously decreasing the amount of flue gas directed to the CCP. This dual effect is expected to result in a reduction in both the overall CCP CapEX and its footprint. The study delves into the impact of EGR return temperature and EGR ratio on the output of gas turbine and combined cycle systems. NGCC performance has been evaluated utilizing GE&#8217;s internal mass and heat balance tools. CCP performance and cost were assessed using commercial tools ProMax and Aspen Process Economic Analyzer. The study demonstrates that providing steam to CCP through a steam integration solution is more effective than using a bolt-on solution. The steam integration solution has a potential to achieve up to 30% decrease in CCP CapEX compared to the bolt-on solution utilizing an auxiliary boiler. In addition, using a 30% EGR in the steam integration solution decreases the CapEx for the CCP by an additional 7%. EGR return temperatures ranging from 27&#176;C to 44&#176;C at 1&#176;C intervals are considered, alongside studied EGR ratios of 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%. The analysis demonstrates that the output of the studied NGCC increases at all studied EGR return temperatures and EGR ratios, reaching a peak at a 35% EGR ratio before leveling off.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Sustainable Aviation Fuels: Impact of Nano-Additives and Ammonia-Based Strategies on Emissions</title>

                Abstract The increasing commitment to sustainable practices has intensified research into innovative methods to diminish the release of harmful pollutants and greenhouse gases, such as CO2, CO, and NOx, into our environment. A promising avenue of exploration lies in the adoption of fuel emulsions enriched with nano-additives aimed at curtailing NOx emissions. In this context, our study delves into the impact of nano-particulate additives &#8212; specifically those based on ammonia and water &#8212; on the combustion characteristics of Jet-A1 aviation fuel. Utilizing a 300-kW liquid swirl combustor, we conducted a series of experiments across two global equivalence ratios (&#934; = 0.24 and &#934; = 0.40). Our investigation encompassed the analysis of laminar flame speed (LFS) and an in-depth examination of flame properties through advanced chemiluminescence imaging and modal analysis techniques. The primary objective was to unravel the complexities of how these nano-additives modulate flame dynamics and the intricate web of internal chemical reactions, alongside evaluating the broader environmental ramifications resulting from alterations in the combustion process. The experimental outcomes revealed that the integration of urea and water additives into the fuel matrix distinctly affected LFS, with observed enhancements at the lower global equivalence ratio and detrimental impacts when the ratio was increased. Through modal analysis, we discerned a notable stabilizing influence on the flame&#8217;s behavior, which was particularly pronounced at leaner fuel conditions. From the study of the spray, the addition of water and urea appears to influence combustion chemistry, and more uniform sprays facilitate more complete combustion. Chemiluminescence imaging further illuminated these effects, demonstrating a higher emission intensity of NH2* radicals compared to NH* radicals, a variance contingent on the global equivalence ratio. Notably, the experimental data indicated a substantial abatement in NOx emissions, predominantly at the lower equivalence ratios. This reduction was accompanied by a marginal uptick in CO2 and CO emissions &#8212; a trade-off that warrants consideration.</description>

      <title>Compressor Development for CO2-Based Pumped Thermal Energy Storage (PTES) Systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/gt2024-124070</link>
      <description>Timothy Held, Jason R. Miller, Kyle Sedlacko, Joshua Cameron, Scott Morris, Jeong-Seek Kang, Mark G. Turner, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401941392

                Abstract Pumped thermal energy storage (PTES) offers a cost-effective means to store electrical energy for long duration by utilizing a heat pump cycle to transfer thermal energy from a low temperature reservoir (LTR) to a high temperature reservoir (HTR). A key component of the PTES system is the heat pump compressor, which represents a significant driver to the cost, performance and operating characteristics of the PTES system. At the power rating of the charging process (&amp;gt; 100 MW), traditional compressor scaling charts indicate that the operating conditions needed would be best served by a multistage axial compressor. While frame gas turbine compressors at these power ratings exist and operate at higher pressure ratios than needed for the CO2 PTES system, the inlet pressure and fluid density of this application exceeds experience values. The conceptual design of a large-scale CO2 axial compressor was completed, including mean-line estimates of the compressor performance at full power conditions. At steady state, full power operation, the isentropic efficiency and mechanical efficiency of the compressor have significant impact on the cycle design and round trip efficiency of the PTES system. The results of the conceptual design were used to refine the PTES cycle design, and updated operating conditions provided for further aero design optimization. An important characteristic of the PTES system is its ability to charge at variable rate, which provides significant challenges on compressor operability, especially for a compressor that will be coupled to a fixed-speed synchronous motor. Cycle studies of variable charging rate processes have been conducted, and the impact of compressor operating map characteristics explored. Based on initial modeling studies, single compressor operation can be achieved down to at least 50% of rated power, with further reductions possible depending on the characteristics of the compressor map speedlines.</description>

      <title>Greenhouse gas emissions of shipping with onboard carbon capture under the FuelEU Maritime regulation: A well-to-wake evaluation of different propulsion scenarios</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.155407</link>

                International shipping has extended its decarbonization strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions beyond onboard CO2 emissions. Onboard carbon capture and storage systems are being investigated as a potential solution for fossil-fueled ships, however there is a lack of knowledge on the reduction of well-to-wake greenhouse gas emissions that could be enabled. Considering the ambitious emission reduction targets, this may lead to inaccurate estimations of the future fuel mix in the maritime sector and the market share of marine engines. This study defines nine ship propulsion scenarios based on combinations of fossil fuels and marine engines. To better understand the greenhouse gas emission reduction of onboard carbon capture, this study calculates the well-to-wake greenhouse gas intensity of each scenario with and without onboard carbon capture and storage from the ship's main engine(s). Deploying onboard carbon capture and storage systems notably reduces the tank-to-wake greenhouse gas intensity (54&#8211;68 % depending on the scenario). Contrary to onboard emissions, oil-fueled ships with onboard carbon capture and storage are found to be less greenhouse gas intensive and more cost-effective than LNG-fueled ships. The four-stroke oil-fueled engine achieves the lowest well-to-wake greenhouse gas intensity of 38.31 gCO2eq/MJ, while the four-stroke LNG-fueled engine has the highest intensity of 50.34 gCO2eq/MJ. The greenhouse gas emission levels enabled by onboard carbon capture from the main engine would allow fossil-fueled ships to comply with the FuelEU Maritime greenhouse gas intensity requirement until 2044. To be compliant in subsequent periods, onboard carbon capture and storage systems will need to consider carbon capture from the auxiliary boiler and generator and higher capture rate, as well as measures to reduce upstream emissions from fossil fuel production and transport.</description>

      <title>Removal of Atmospheric Methane by Increasing Hydroxyl Radicals via a Water Vapor Enhancement Strategy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos15091046</link>
      <description>Yang Liu, Xiaokun Yao, Li Zhou, Tingzhen Ming, Wei Li, Renaud de Richter, Atmosphere. 15(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401995269

                Methane is the second largest contributor to global surface air temperature rise. Reducing atmospheric methane will mitigate climate change and improve air quality. Since the main sink of methane is the hydroxyl radical (OH) in the atmosphere, increasing OH concentration will accelerate the methane oxidation process and reduce methane concentration. Because the primary source of OH is the reaction between water vapor and ozone, scientists have proposed a water vapor enhancement strategy to raise OH concentrations in the atmosphere and remove methane. We use a two-box model to evaluate interactions between OH and methane and a radiative kernel method to calculate radiative responses to water vapor content growth. This proves that increasing OH concentration does have a positive effect on methane reduction. If the concentration of OH is increased by 10% from its current value and maintained for 50 (100) years, 45 Tg yr&#8722;1 (67.5 Tg yr&#8722;1) more methane will be oxidized by OH, and the cumulative effects of the oxidation are equivalent to a 120.5 Gt (219.6 Gt) reduction in CO2 and will lower the global surface air temperature by 0.054 &#176;C (0.099 &#176;C). Our study also provides insights into a mixed picture of global and regional radiative responses to the growth of water vapor content. The reduced radiative forcing by methane removal cannot overpower the increased radiative forcing by water vapor from the global average point of view. However, due to OH&#8217;s greater sensitivity to water vapor and weaker radiative response at higher latitudes, this perspective may be reversed if abrupt CH4 emissions from permafrost thaw occur.</description>

                The development of new building elements, such as concrete and mortar with sustainable materials, which produce a lower carbon footprint, is an achievable milestone in the short term. The need to reduce the environmental impact of the production of cement-based materials is of vital importance. This work focuses on the evaluation of the life-cycle assessment, production costs, mechanical performance, and durability of three mortars and three concrete mixtures in which mixed recycled aggregates (MRAs) and biomass bottom ash from olive waste (oBBA) were included to replace cement and aggregates. Powdered MRA and oBBA were also applied as complementary cementitious materials with a reduced environmental footprint. Chemical and physical tests were performed on the materials, and mechanical performance properties, life-cycle assessment, and life-cycle cost analysis were applied to demonstrate the technical and environmental benefits of using these materials in mortar and concrete mixtures. This research showed that the application of MRA and oBBA produced a small reduction in mechanical strength but a significant benefit in terms of life-cycle population and environmental costs. The results demonstrated that finding long-term mechanical strength decreases between 2.7% and 14% for mortar mixes and between 1.7% and 10.4% for concrete mixes. Although there were small reductions in mechanical performance, the savings in environmental and monetary terms make the feasibility of manufacturing these cement-based materials feasible and interesting for both society and the business world. CO2 emissions are reduced by 25% for mortar mixes and 12% for concrete mixes with recycled materials, and it is possible to reduce the cost per cubic meter of mortar production by 20%, and the savings in the cost of production of a cubic meter of concrete is 13.8%.</description>

                Abstract The challenges of climate change have led to an increased commitment from both industry and government to environmentally friendly technologies. In the aviation industry, goals of CO2 and NOx reduction were implemented in the Flightpath 2050. One way to reach this goal is by using alternative propulsion systems, such as fuel cells. The ecologic feasibility of the hydrogen fuel cell depends heavily on its performance which in turn is largely determined by the power to weight ratio as well as the volumetric flows of reactants conveyed within the cell. In this context, a key component for the performance is the bipolar plate (BPP), as its channel geometry defines the volumetric flows of reactants. To reduce the mass of the bipolar plate, lightweight materials such as titanium are used. This on the other hand leads to challenges in the forming of BPP regarding its quality and safety due to its material properties. In this paper, three different manufacturing methods are investigated numerically regarding their feasibility for the use in bipolar plate manufacturing for the aviation industry. To evaluate the suitability of the regarded manufacturing processes, the results are compared in terms of shape accuracy, material thinning as well as stress states. The three-dimensional simulations showed that hydroforming leads to the highest material thinning compared to rubber pad forming and embossing. The shape accuracy was the highest for rubber pad forming, while the stress states varied just marginal.</description>

      <title>Heating and ventilation efficiencies of a solar chimney integrated system in a low-energy office building</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0210530</link>

                Mechanical air conditioning systems have a significant share of energy consumption in the building sector. Passive solar systems, such as solar chimneys, can reduce building energy demand by supplying space heating, cooling, and ventilation, significantly decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the heating and ventilation efficiencies of a solar chimney integrated system, including a roof solar chimney coupled with an air channel, for a two-story office building in Tehran, Iran. The studied system's conditions are switchable from heating to cooling by changing the opening positions. Computational Fluid Dynamics was employed to numerically investigate the heating and ventilation efficiencies of the proposed solar system. The results confirmed that the system could be utilized for pre-heating purposes during working hours but that the building should be ventilated only for 35% of this time with an air change rate of 0.8 during the year's coldest month. The arrangement could provide thermal and ventilation comfort for the occupied space only at solar intensity and ambient temperature higher than 550 W/m2 and 10 &#176;C, respectively. In addition, the solar system could reduce 32% of the annual heating demand (918 kWh), which is equal to a reduction of 1865 kg of CO2 emissions during working hours.</description>

                Indoor air quality (IAQ) has a significant impact on human health, as people spend 90% of their time in various indoor environments. Therefore, research on IAQ is extremely necessary. However, current research on traditional Qiang residences in western Sichuan mainly focuses on the indoor thermal environment and heritage protection, with relatively little attention paid to IAQ. This study investigates the IAQ of traditional Qiang residences in western Sichuan, which have open fire pits as the core of daily life, exploring the impact of passive renovation strategies on the indoor air quality. Using simulation methods, this study employs passive strategies, such as increasing the size of windward windows, changing ventilation methods, relocating the fire pit, and enlarging interior partition openings, to improve and optimize the IAQ through natural ventilation. The results show that when the windward window sizes are 0.8 m &#215; 1.9 m and 0.7 m &#215; 1.55 m, the reduction in the indoor CO2 concentration is the greatest, with a maximum decrease of 0.024% at the 1.5 m plane. This paper proposes passive renovation strategies to improve the indoor air quality of Qiang residences in western Sichuan. These strategies effectively enhance the indoor air quality of Qiang residences and address the research gap on indoor air quality in regional Qiang residences in western Sichuan. The insights and methods presented contribute to the improvement of the indoor air quality in traditional buildings and support the sustainable development of traditional architecture.</description>

                The multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols produced by electrochemical CO2 reduction, such as ethanol and n&#8208;propanol, are considered as indispensable liquid energy carriers. In most C&#8211;C coupling cases, however, the concomitant gaseous C2H4 product results in the low selectivity of C2+ alcohols. Here, we report rational construction of mesostructured CuO electrocatalysts, specifically mesoporous CuO (m&#8208;CuO) and cylindrical CuO (c&#8208;CuO), enables selective distribution of C2+ products. The m&#8208;CuO and c&#8208;CuO showed similar selectivity towards total C2+ products (&#8805;76%), but the corresponding predominant products were C2+ alcohols (55%) and C2H4 (52%), respectively. The ordered mesostructure not only induced the surface hydrophobicity, but selectively tailored the adsorption configuration of *CO intermediate: m&#8208;CuO preferred bridged adsorption, whereas c&#8208;CuO favored top adsorption as revealed by in situ spectroscopies. Computational calculations unraveled that bridged *CO adsorbate is prone to deep protonation into *OCH3 intermediate, thus accelerating the coupling of *CO and *OCH3 intermediates to generate C2+ alcohols; by contrast, top *CO adsorbate is apt to undergo the favorable conventional C&#8211;C coupling process to produce C2H4. This work illustrates selective C2+ products distribution via mesostructure manipulation, and paves new path into the design of efficient electrocatalysts with tunable adsorption configuration of key intermediates for targeted products.</description>

      <title>Priming effect of pigeon pea and wood biochar on carbon mineralization of native soil organic carbon and applied municipal solid waste compost</title>

                A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted for 36 days to study the effect of pigeon pea biochar (PPB) and wood biochar (WB) on carbon mineralization of native soil organic carbon (SOC) and municipal solid waste compost (MSWC) applied to soil. The MSWC addition enhanced soil respiration by 2-fold (231 mg C kg-1 soil) over the control (118 mg C kg-1 soil). The PPB addition significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased cumulative loss of carbon as CO2, whereas WB significantly decreased the cumulative loss of C over control. Addition of PPB at 5% and 10% levels increased SOC mineralization (positive priming) +22.9% and +31.2%, respectively; whereas reduction in SOC mineralization (negative priming) was noticed in WB (5% and 10%) treated soils by -3.1% and -21.7%, respectively. Similarly, WB induced strong negative priming effects (-21.9% and -29.5%), while PPB caused a weak positive priming effect (+3.0% and +11.6%) at 5% and 10% levels on mineralization of added labile carbon substrate (MSWC), respectively. Results indicate the hardwood (Prosopis juliflora) biochar exhibits refractory properties that inhibit mineralization of both native SOC and applied organic compost (MSWC), and thereby it can be used as an amendment to stabilize native and applied organic matter in soil, which may significantly contribute to soil carbon sequestration.</description>

      <title>Environmental Benefits of Circular Ethylene Production from Polymer Waste</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c04241</link>

                The linear nature of the current plastics economy and increasing demand for polymers poses a pressing global problem. In this work, we explore the environmental and economic performance of a circular alternative for polymer production through chemical plastic recycling following the waste-to-methanol-to-olefins (WMO) route. We assess the life-cycle environmental impacts and techno-economic feasibility of this novel circular production route (CPR) in 2020 and 2050, and compare them to the existing linear production route (LPR), deploying naphtha steam cracking for olefin production, and a mix of landfill and incineration as end-of-life treatment. Our results showcase that CPR could enable significant impact reductions, notably in 2050 assuming a low-carbon electricity mix based on renewables. However, the shift from linear to circular comes with burden-shifting, increasing the impacts relative to LPR on five environmental indicators in 2020 (i.e., terrestrial and freshwater eutrophication, particulate matter formation, acidification, and metal/mineral resources use). From the techno-economic viewpoint, we found that ethylene from waste polymers could become competitive with fossil ethylene when deployed at large scale. Moreover, it is significantly cheaper than its green analogs, which deploy methanol-to-olefins with green methanol from captured CO2 and electrolytic H2, showcasing the potential of implementing high-readiness level technologies to close the loop for polymers.</description>

                Abstract In the search for alternative aviation fuels, ammonia shows much promise. The higher density and boiling point of ammonia compared to hydrogen could mean ammonia could be used without a dramatic rethinking of aircraft architecture. Instead, the possibility exists that current aircraft and engines could be retrofitted to use ammonia instead of traditional jet fuel. This paper aims to address the engine aspect of such a retrofit. The open-source Toolbox for Modeling and Analysis of Thermodynamic Systems (T-MATS) is modified to allow for the modeling of ammonia fueled engines and the addition of heat exchangers and other technologies. A thermodynamic cycle model of a baseline ammonia engine is created retaining the turbomachinery maps, duct sizes, nozzle areas, and bleed flow rates from a kerosene engine. This engine is then modified by adding heat exchangers and a supercritical CO2 waste heat recovery (WHR) cycle to produce power for the engine and aid in the preheating of the ammonia. Preliminary analysis is performed to determine the ideal location of heat exchangers to benefit cycle efficiency. This analysis suggests that using the ammonia as a heat sink to intercool and recuperate the engine allows for significant improvements over baseline performance. From there, optimization of the geometry of the added heat exchangers is performed to limit heat exchanger size and minimize engine fuel consumption at cruise. The addition of these heat exchangers allows for a reduction in fuel burn of 3%&#8211;9% over the baseline engine. Additionally, the WHR cycle can produce the required 250 horsepower (186 kW) of electrical power for the aircraft and the ammonia temperature is increased from 420&#176;R to over 1400&#176;R (233K to 778K). Investigating the results of the optimization shows that making more substantial changes to engines could allow for further improvements to engine performance past that of a retrofit.</description>

      <title>Application of iodine plasma for electric propulsion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.32620/aktt.2024.4sup1.10</link>
      <description>S Ramasamy, Leonid Bazyma, Aerospace technic and technology. None(4sup1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402040697

                Most state-of-the-art electric space propulsion systems, such as gridded and Hall effect thrusters, use xenon as the propellant gas. However, xenon is very rare and expensive to produce, and it is used in a number of competing industrial applications. Iodine is emerging as an attractive alternative to xenon in several electric propulsion technologies. Its lower cost and larger availability, solid state at standard temperature and pressure, its low vapor pressure and its low ionization potential make it an attractive option. Attempts to implement an alternative to xenon propellants (Iodine, O2 , N2 , H2 , CO2 etc) in conventional propulsion systems have been met with measured success. However, the use of chemically reactive species, such as O2, H2, or iodine, requires the chosen propulsion platform to be chemically compatible with the propellant. Significant reductions in the operational lifetime of the thruster because of chemical incompatibility negates any potential increase in thruster performance or propellant availability. Thus, careful material selection for the electric propulsion system itself and for the components employed on the satellite is required in the light of a typical space mission duration of several years. Due to the more complex reaction processes and energy loss channels in iodine plasma&#180;s however, as well as the historical lack of reliable collision cross-section data, the development of accurate theoretical and numerical models has been hindered. The development of techniques that can be applied to chemically dissimilar propellants, focusing on electromagnetic behaviour, would represent a significant improvement in the state of discharge characterization and thruster analysis. In this work, we conducted a comparative analysis of the existing modeling results for various types of electric propulsion using iodine as a propellant gas, as well as the results of experiments with iodine plasma with an emphasis on the thrust-to-power ratio.</description>

      <title>Exogenous Melatonin Alleviates Osmotic Stress by Enhancing Antioxidant Metabolism, Photosynthetic Maintenance, and Hormone Homeostasis in Forage Oat (Avena sativa) Seedlings</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/grasses3030014</link>

                Melatonin (MT) is a multifunctional hormone that enhances crop resilience against various abiotic stresses. However, its regulatory mechanism of osmotic tolerance in forage oats (Avena sativa) plants under water-limited scenarios is still unclear. This study aimed to delineate the impact of MT pretreatment on the morphological, physiological, and biochemical functions of oat seedlings under osmotic stress. Our findings demonstrated that exogenous treatment of MT noticeably elevated leaf area while decreasing the root/shoot ratio of oat seedlings subjected to osmotic stress. Osmotic-induced 38.22% or 48.37% decrease in relative water content could be significantly alleviated by MT pretreatment on day 7 or day 14, respectively. MT treatment also significantly mitigated osmotic-induced decreases in photosynthetic parameters including net photosynthetic rate, stomatic conductance, and intercellular CO2 concentration as well as various chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, which could contribute to enhanced accumulations of free proline and soluble sugars in seedlings after being subjected to a prolonged duration of osmotic stress. Furthermore, MT markedly improved antioxidant enzyme activities including superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, and peroxidase along with the accumulation of ascorbic acid contributing to a significant reduction in reactive oxygen species under osmotic stress. In addition, the MT application induced a 978.12%, 33.54%, or 30.59% increase in endogenous MT, indole acetic acid, or gibberellic acid content under osmotic stress but did not affect the accumulation of abscisic acid. These findings suggest that an optimal concentration of MT (100 &#956;mol&#183;L&#8722;1) could relieve osmotic stress via improvement in osmotic adjustment, the enzymatic antioxidant defense system, and endogenous hormonal balance, thereby contributing to enhanced photosynthetic functions and growth of oat seedlings under water-limited conditions.</description>

      <title>Application of an Improved Workflow for the Identification of Flame Dynamics to Swirl Stabilized Wet Combustion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/gt2024-125057</link>
      <description>Marcel D&#233;sor, Matthias Haeringer, Marian Hiestermann, Korbinian Niebler, Camilo F. Silva, Wolfgang Polifke, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401942310

                Abstract The estimation of a flame transfer function (FTF)from time series data generated by large eddy simulation (LES) via system identification (SI) is an established and important element of thermoacoustic analysis. To achieve results with low uncertainties, continuous (non-truncated) time series of adequate length are required. This can be a challenge in the case of turbulent flames, where signal-to-noise ratio may be low. Because LES codes do not scale to an arbitrarily high degree of parallelism, the wall-clock-time required for confident FTF estimation may be excessive. The present paper tackles this challenge by exploiting characteristic features of linear time-invariant systems. Specifically, we explore how the superposition of multiple simulations with the same excitation signal, but varying initial conditions, increases signal-to-noise ratio and leads to more robust identification, i.e. estimates with narrow confidence intervals. In addition, the established SI approach, which relies on broadband excitation, is compared to excitation with approximate Dirac and Heaviside signals, with the advantage of simpler pre- and post-processing. Results demonstrate that the proposed workflow, which is inherently parallel because it is based on superposition, reduces significantly the wall-clock-time required for robust FTF identification in the case of broadband excitation. This reduction in wall-clock-time requires more simultaneous simulation runs, i.e. more parallel computational resources, but it does not significantly increase the overall computational cost. Furthermore, the new workflow facilitates FTF estimation when exciting with a Heaviside signal. The proposed method is assessed for the case of a partially premixed, steam enriched (&#8220;WET&#8221;) swirl burner with significant turbulent noise levels. Steam enrichment is a combustion concept that reduces harmful emissions such as NOx and CO2 while increasing engine efficiency. However, the effect of steam on the flame response, i.e. the FTF, needs to be better understood. To this end, a combustion model that includes an optimized global chemical mechanism for partially premixed wet methane combustion, has been formulated and validated against experimental data.</description>

                Peatland drainage is a large source of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. While conversion to agriculture is widely acknowledged to lead to "irrecoverable" carbon (C) losses, in contrast the C impacts of peatland forestry are poorly understood, especially in intensively managed plantations. Losses of C from peat oxidation are highly variable and can be compensated for by gains of C in trees, depending on the lifecycle of the timber and timescale considered. Here, we used ITRAX scanning to enable rapid detection of the Hekla 4 cryptotephra layer as a reliable chronological marker above which peat properties and C stocks could be compared between open and afforested blanket bog cores in the Flow Country of Northern Scotland. At one site, Bad a' Che&#242;, we combine replicated core pair comparisons (n = 19) with timber extraction data to derive net ecosystem C balance over the lifetime of the plantation. Here the reduction in peat C carbon storage above Hekla 4 in afforested samples (67 t C ha&#8722;1) is only partially compensated by tree C sequestration (47 t C ha&#8722;1), leading to a net ecosystem C balance indicating a loss of 20 t C ha&#8722;1 over the 50 years since the plantation was established. At that site, ~65 % of tree C rapidly returned to the atmosphere, as it was primarily used for heat and power generation. Across the wider Flow country region, a simplified paired sampling method was adopted at eight further sites, finding a either a loss or negligible change in peat C storage above Hekla 4 in afforested samples with a mean loss of 86 t C ha&#8722;1 and median loss of 50 t C ha&#8722;1. This study suggests that potentially substantial C losses have been an unintended consequence of non-native conifer afforestation over deep blanket bogs.</description>

                Operating the pressurized catalytic dry reforming of methane (DRM) reaction is promising for industrial applications; however, two of the most challenging problems are serious coke deposition and metal sintering, especially under high temperature. Designing a catalyst with a small metal particle size, strong metal&#8211;support interaction (MSI), high migration rate of oxygen species, and moderate basicity can be effective to solve these problems. In this work, we prepared Ce and La promoted Co/C catalysts and compared their structural properties, catalytic activity, and stability with Co/C. The results show that 4 wt % Ce promoted Co/C (Co-4Ce/C) exhibits a small average metal particle size of 3.87 nm, larger specific surface area (396 m2/g), stronger MSI, higher reduction degree of active metal, larger content of surface chemical adsorbed oxygen, and medium basicity (0.286 mmol/g), providing better catalytic performance with stable CH4 conversion, CO2 conversion, and H2/CO ratio values of 78.0%, 85.8% and 0.77, respectively, for 100 h of reaction under 800 &#176;C, 0.5 MPa, and 30,000 mL&#183;gcat&#8211;1&#183;h&#8211;1. Only a slight increase of metal particle size as well as a lower amount of deposited carbon were observed on the reacted catalyst, well explaining its good stability. Moreover, the carbon nanotube structure was detected on the surface of Co-4Ce/C, indicating the formation of a kind of more stable carbon-based catalyst. At last, a bifunctional activation mechanism was proposed based on the analysis of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, which can illustrate the shorter induction period and its enhanced activity. Overall, the Co-4Ce/C exhibits excellent resistance of metal sintering and carbon deposition and would be attractive for the catalytic DRM reaction, especially under an elevated pressure.</description>

      <title>Experimental analysis of hemispherical combustion geometry of diesel engine (neem oil) biodiesel with nano additives</title>

                The current study examines the efficiency and environmental impact of a diesel engine running on neem oil biodiesel mixed with nano additions, notably Manganese oxide (MnO) and Ferric chloride (FeCl3). The study seeks to tackle the urgent problem of pollutant emissions, specifically nitrogen oxides (NOx), from internal combustion engines. Biodiesel, sourced from renewable substances such as neem oil, offers a possible substitute for traditional diesel fuel. Nevertheless, the general use of this technology is impeded by difficulties such as increased NOx emissions and fuel volatility. In order to address these difficulties, this study investigates the application of nano additives to improve the efficiency of combustion and decrease emissions. Various fuel blends, such as pure diesel, neem oil biodiesel (B25), and blends of B25 with MnO and FeCl3, were used in experimental experiments. An ultrasonic aspirator was used to include 100 parts per million (ppm) of each nano ingredient into the B20 blend. The performance metrics, including engine efficiency, power output, and emissions levels of NOx, CO, HC, CO2, and particulate matter, were assessed and compared to the standard diesel fuel. The results demonstrated that the inclusion of nano additives enhances the combustion properties, resulting in decreased emissions, specifically NOx. The Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) increased for the nano-blended test fuels compared to diesel, resulting in a reduction in Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC). The BTE (Brake Thermal Efficiency) level reaches its peak when the engine is operating at maximum load using the B25 + MnO and B25 + FeCl3 fuel blend. The emissions of gases such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), smoke, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in nano mixed fuels are significantly lower than those produced by diesel fuel operation. The B25 + FeCl3 fuel mix has a higher emission of hydrocarbon (HC) content compared to other nano-blended fuels, but it emits less HC content than diesel fuel. The diesel and biodiesel test fuels exhibit optimal performance under load conditions of up to 50%. Diesel, B25 mix, B25 + MnO, and B25 + FeCl3 had carbon monoxide (CO) emissions ranging from 0.045 to 0.050%, whilst the other two test fuels have emissions ranging from 0.029 to 0.035%. Under a load condition of 50%, the carbon monoxide (CO) emissions for the fuel blends B25 + MnO and B25 + FeCl3 vary between 0.001% and 0.011%. The cylinder pressure and heat release rates are marginally elevated compared to those of the diesel fuel. The findings indicated that neem oil biodiesel with nano additions has the potential to be a feasible and eco-friendly substitute fuel for diesel engines.</description>

      <title>The Role of Waste Reduction Technology in Sustainable Recycling of Waste Paper at Thi-Qar University</title>

                The purpose of this study is reducing sustainable paper recycling at Thi-Qar University by using waste reduction techniques.It can be argued with much confidence that the idea of recycling paper can be successfully implemented in an academic institution.This can be done by merging the specific waste paper baskets, pulping machine and power from a renewable source with an already established local paper making company.The methods applied in this study are making company would be able to recoup a government subsidy that pays them to recycle paper in order to offset the cost of pulped paper which is 30% more expensive than raw wood pulp.The academic institution that implements this would save money on waste disposal, and cut its carbon footprint in half, by up to 600%, per year approximately five-six tons of CO2 instead of one-ton-two tones carbon offset for simply recycling the paper.All these steps could also be applied for recycling of the large amount of waste papers generated by students an idea that encounters high costs in recycling hence being rarely implemented.This could be achieved through urged use of the same paper disposal methods already in use, where the paper collected is pulped from the student paper waste bins once a week.The results of this article are more specific yet indirect environmental benefit concerns the recycling habits of students.By providing the means for students to recycle paper at their places of study, it is hoped that they will adopt similar practices in their homes and other areas of life and show that the practice of paper recycling at Thi-Qar University has a success rate of 98.42%.Additionally, a total revenue of $3,527.98 was collected from the value of recycled paper.This can be important, as it is today's young people who will shape the future condition of the environment.If a more conscientious attitude towards recycling can be established, the cumulative environmental benefits could be very significant.On the economic side, recycling paper can potentially save academic institutions a substantial amount of money on their waste disposal.This is because paper and cardboard often make up a high percentage of the waste and these are materials which can be recycled relatively cheaply.By decreasing the volume of general waste, a decrease in waste disposal costs can be achieved.If institutions take it a step further and decide to purchase only recycled paper products, this can also help accelerate the demand for recycled paper and its long-term economic feasibility.The benefits of paper recycling in academic institutions are undoubtedly far-reaching.Not only are the environmental benefits significant, but also the potential cost savings and impact on student attitudes.Probably the most apparent benefits of paper recycling are the environmental ones.The significance of this research is recycling paper in academic institutions is not only beneficial to the environment but also has potential cost-saving implications and significant educational value for students' attitudes.</description>
