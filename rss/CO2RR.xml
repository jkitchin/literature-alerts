                The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) presents a promising solution for mitigating CO2 emissions while producing valuable chemical feedstocks. Although single&#8208;atom catalysts have shown potential in selectively converting CO2 to CH4, their limited active sites often hinder the realization of high current densities, posing a selectivity&#8208;activity dilemma. In this study, we developed a single&#8208;atom cobalt (Co) doped copper catalyst (Co1Cu) that achieved a CH4 Faradaic efficiency exceeding 60% with a partial current density of &#8208;482.7 mA cm&#8208;2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the incorporation of single Co atoms enhances the activation and dissociation of H2O molecules, thereby lowering the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of *CO intermediates. In situ spectroscopic experiments and density functional theory simulations further demonstrated that the modulation of the *CO adsorption configuration, with stronger bridge&#8208;binding, favours deep reduction to CH4 over the C&#8208;C coupling or CO desorption pathways. Our findings underscore the potential of Co1Cu catalysts in overcoming the selectivity&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off, paving the way for efficient and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion technologies.</description>

      <title>Effects of Annealing Conditions on the Catalytic Performance of Anodized Tin Oxide for Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>

                The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to value-added products has garnered significant interest as a sustainable solution to mitigate CO2 emissions and harness renewable energy sources. Among CO2RR products, formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO&#8722;) is particularly attractive due to its industrial relevance, high energy density, and potential candidate as a liquid hydrogen carrier. This study investigates the influence of the initial oxidation state of tin on CO2RR performance using nanostructured SnOx catalysts. A simple, quick, scalable, and cost-effective synthesis strategy was employed to fabricate SnOx catalysts with controlled oxidation states while maintaining consistent morphology and particle size. The catalysts were characterized using SEM, TEM, XRD, Raman, and XPS to correlate structure and surface properties with catalytic performance. Electrochemical measurements revealed that SnOx catalysts annealed in air at 525 &#176;C exhibited the highest formate selectivity and current density, attributed to the optimized oxidation state and the presence of oxygen vacancies. Flow cell tests further demonstrated enhanced performance under practical conditions, achieving stable formate production with high faradaic efficiency over prolonged operation. These findings highlight the critical role of tin oxidation states and surface defects in tuning CO2RR performance, offering valuable insights for the design of efficient catalysts for CO2 electroreduction to formate.</description>

      <title>Catalyst design for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide: from copper nanoparticles to copper single atoms</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20517/microstructures.2024.69</link>

                Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an efficacious method to mitigate carbon emissions and simultaneously convert CO2 into high-value carbon products. The efficiency of CO2RR depends on the development of highly active and selective catalysts. Copper (Cu)-based catalysts can effectively reduce CO2 to hydrocarbons and oxygen-containing compounds because of their unique geometric and electronic structures. Most importantly, Cu can reduce CO2 to multiple carbon products (C2+). Therefore, this review aims to outline recent research progress in Cu-based catalysts for CO2RR. After introducing the mechanism of this electroreduction reaction, we summarize the influence of the size, morphology, and coordination environment of single component Cu-based catalysts on their performance, especially the performance control of catalysts that contain nano Cu or Cu single-atom sites. Then, the synergistic regulation strategies of doping other metals into Cu-based catalysts are summarized. Finally, the research on the supports used for Cu-based catalysts is reviewed. The prospects and challenges of Cu-based catalysts are discussed.</description>

      <title>Kinetic modelling and simulation of bioanode and biocathode in a bioelectrochemical cell for carbon dioxide reduction</title>

                Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) have garnered extensive research attention for their biosynthesis and environmental remediation applications. One of the challenges to upscaling BES for carbon dioxide (CO2) methanation is energy-efficient process development. Investigations are ongoing to determine the relationship between the yield of electroactive microorganisms, the key candidates for electrochemical reactions with external electricity input. Consequently, simulating processes, particularly with biocathode for biosynthesis and bioanode for remediation, gives crucial insights for designing efficient BESs. The framework for establishing Nernst-Monod equations for modeling BES, starts from bioanode, where anode respiring bacteria (ARB) oxidize organic carbon compounds to CO2, and generate the proton (H+). In this work, kinetic modeling was applied to calculate the biomass yield of ARBs corresponding to the applied anodic voltage. The generated CO2 and H+ from the anode determined the biomass yield of electroactive methanogens and acetogens on the cathode. Two biofilm models were established for anodic and cathodic biofilm growth in the Aquasim simulation tool. Results showed that the concentration of organic carbon compound (acetate) available for ARB, had a significant impact on the biofilm thickness and biomass concentration on the biofilm, especially at +0.3 V. The optimum anode voltage which released the highest CO2 and H+, was +0.3 V. The anodic and cathodic biofilm thickness reached 3 mm and 55 &#181;m, respectively, at +0.3 V and 10 g.L-1 acetate input to the anode chamber. Moreover, methanogens surpassed acetogens on the biocathode for CO2 reduction to methane rather than acetate. In addition, acetate consumption rate by ARB at anode was remarkably faster than acetate production at cathode.</description>

      <title>Mitigation Strategies Based on Life Cycle Assessment for Carbon Dioxide Reduction in Asphalt Pavements: Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su17020695</link>
      <description>Diego Flores-Ruiz, Marco Montoya-Alcaraz, Leonel Garc&#237;a, &#769;Jos&#233; Manuel Guti&#233;rrez-Moreno, Julio Calder&#243;n-Ram&#237;rez, Sustainability. 17(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406489020

                Expanding the road network is inevitable due to the accelerated economic growth of countries. However, the development of road infrastructure has generated considerable concern among society, governments, and environmental organizations. This concern mainly stems from the significant environmental effects and the omission of the sustainability of materials associated with road construction. Current literature suggests Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as a solution to address greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts of road infrastructure. This research uses the PRISMA-SCR methodology to identify strategies to mitigate environmental impact during the life cycle stages of asphalt pavements and emission-generating activities. This study identifies the critical life cycle stages responsible for the largest amount of emissions, highlighting &#8220;material extraction and production&#8221; and &#8220;transportation&#8221; as key areas of intervention. The results demonstrate how the incorporation of recycled materials (RAPs) and warm mix asphalts (WMAs) can reduce between 15% and 45% of total emissions. It is concluded that it is possible to develop asphalt pavement construction projects with a sustainability perspective, allowing not only to identify opportunities to optimize construction processes but also to establish a reference framework for transportation agencies to integrate more sustainable practices, including the reduction of emissions, the responsible use of non-renewable resources and proper waste management.</description>

      <title>Integrated system for electrolyte recovery, product separation, and CO2 capture in CO2 reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-56111-6</link>
      <description>Peng Wang, An Pei, Zhaoxi Chen, Pingyong Sun, Chengyi Hu, Xue Wang, Nanfeng Zheng, Guangxu Chen, Nature Communications. 16(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406468132

                Challenges in CO2 capture, CO2 crossover, product separation, and electrolyte recovery hinder electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R). Here, we present an integrated electrochemical recovery and separation system (ERSS) with an ion separation module (ISM) between the anode and cathode of a water electrolysis system. During ERSS operation, protons from the anolyte flow through the anodic cation exchange membrane (CEM) into the ISM, acidifying the CO2R effluent electrolyte. Cations like K+ in the ISM flow through the cathodic CEM into the catholyte to balance the OH- ions from hydrogen evolution. ERSS recycles electrolyte-adsorbed CO2, recovers KOH with a 94.0% K+ yield, and achieves an 86.2% separation efficiency for CO2R products. The recovered KOH can capture CO2 from air or flue gas or be utilized as a CO2R electrolyte, closing the CO2 capture, conversion, and utilization loop. Compared to the conventional acid-base neutralization process, ERSS saves $119.76 per ton of KOH recovered and is applicable to other aqueous alkaline electrosynthesis reactions.</description>

      <description>Jiri Jilek, International Journal of Scientific Research in Science and Technology. 12(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406380419

                Regarding the environmental impact of Ridesharing integrated with AVs, this paper examines the work done to identify substantial CO2 reductions possible with AV use. Drawing on the trends in the shift to AV and on the adoption of EVs, the paper estimates the potential green effects of swapping ICE vehicles for autonomous electric ones. We also discuss updates in AVs, infrastructure issues, solar power options for charging stations, future forecasts of global CO2 emissions, and the felt shortcomings of this study. The study shows that although AVs may hold the key to the dramatic reduction in emission levels, their potential is only as good as the infrastructure and policies in place, as well as a few technological constraints.</description>

                In 2022, global coal combustion contributed significantly to global pollution, producing 15.22 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2). This research addresses the urgent challenge of mitigating CO2 emissions in Indian coal power plants by strategically deploying solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and integrating demand response mechanisms. The imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal-based electricity generation underscores the critical context of climate change. Emphasizing the vital role of integrating renewable energy-based distributed generators into the existing coal infrastructure, this study positions solar PV technology as a promising solution. Optimal solar PV system allocation is achieved through the implementation of the genetic algorithm technique. Factors such as solar resource availability, electricity demand patterns, and the CO2 intensity associated with coal power generation are considered in this process. The primary research objective is twofold: to minimize CO2 emissions and maximize the integration of solar PV systems while mitigating power losses. The proposed approach considers the intermittent nature of solar power and the dynamic characteristics of demand. Rigorous testing on an IEEE 33-bus system powered by the studied coal power plant reveals a substantial 29.31% reduction in CO2 generation following the implementation of the proposed strategy. This research represents a decisive step towards fostering a more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy landscape. Our study's outcomes offer valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders in the energy sector, providing a robust foundation for the advancement of environmentally conscious practices within the coal power industry.</description>

      <title>Peaks and pitfalls of electrocatalytic descriptor models at the example of CO2 reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-5559232/v1</link>

                Abstract Electrocatalysis advances rely on the development of efficient catalysts. Systematic material design hinges on identifying activity and selectivity descriptors. While adsorption energy descriptors have helped predict new materials, they are typically based on pure metals, uncertain of their applicability to complex materials like alloys. Here, we systematically analyze the validity of descriptor models for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR). For this, we prepare gold, silver, and palladium alloys of variable composition and confirm experimentally the continuous variation of the d-band center (i.e. the CO adsorption energy) and work function (i.e. the potential of zero charge). Our results indicate that while the d-band center is the decisive factor for CO production, it, along with the work function, fails to fully explain the production of HCOO&#8722; and H2. Designing a copper-like alloy based on the matching of these descriptor values showed no formation of C2 products (as commonly expected for copper). This breakdown of the descriptor model is explained from first-principles calculations by the heterogeneity of the surface leading to different deactivation pathways for C2 product formation. Our results highlight the problems in transferring conventional descriptor models to more complex, heterogeneous materials motivating future developments.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Metal Oxides Stabilize Cu Oxidation States for Electrocatalytical CO2 Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202402510</link>
      <description>Yu Zhao, H. Wang, Chunxiao Liu, Yuan Ji, Xu Li, Qiu Jiang, Chuan Xia, Tingting Zheng, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406331856

                Modulating the oxidation state of copper (Cu) is crucial for enhancing the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), particularly for facilitating deep reductions to produce methane (CH4) or multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. However, Cu&#948;+ sites are thermodynamically unstable, fluctuating their oxidation states under reaction conditions, which complicates their functionality. Incorporating interfacial metal oxides has emerged as an effective strategy for stabilizing these oxidation states. This review provides an in&#8208;depth examination of the reaction mechanisms occurring at oxide&#8208;modified Cu&#948;+ sites, offering a comprehensive understanding of their behavior. We explore how Cu/metal oxide interfaces stabilize Cu oxidation states, showing that oxides&#8208;modified Cu catalysts often enhance selectivity for C2+ or CH4 products by stabilizing Cu+ or Cu2+ sites. In addition, we discuss innovative strategies for the rational design of efficient Cu catalytic sites tailored for specific deep CO2RR products. The review concludes with an outlook on current challenges and future directions, offering new insights into the rational design of selective and efficient CO2RR catalysts.</description>

      <title>Catalytic reduction of imines with silylformates: Formation of silyl carbamates through CO2 insertion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202403907</link>
      <description>Thibault Cantat, Neethu Thyagarajan, Ruqaya Buhaibeh, Emmanuel Nicolas, Chemistry - A European Journal. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406377564

                Silylformates are emerging surrogates of hydrosilanes, able to reduce carbonyl groups in transfer hydrosilylation reactions, with the concomitant release of CO2. In this work, a new reactivity is revealed for silylformates, in the presence of imines. Using ruthenium catalysts, and lithium iodide as a co&#8208;catalyst, imines are shown to undergo hydrocarboxysilylation by formal insertion of CO2 to the N&#8208;Si bond of silyl amine to yield silyl carbamates in excellent yields.</description>

                Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as versatile materials with remarkably high surface areas and tunable properties, attracting significant attention for various applications. In this work, the modification of a UiO-66 MOF with metal nanoparticles (NPs) is investigated for the purpose of enhancing its photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction to liquid fuels. Several NPs (Au, Cu, Ag, Pd, Pt, and Ni) were loaded into the UiO-66 framework and employed as photocatalysts. The synergistic effects of plasmonic resonance and MOF characteristics were investigated to improve photocatalytic performance. The synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), confirming the successful integration of metal NPs onto the UiO-66 framework. Morphological analysis revealed distinct distributions and sizes of NPs on the UiO-66 surface for different metals. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction experiments demonstrated enhanced activity of plasmonic MOFs, yielding methanol and ethanol. The findings revealed by this study provide valuable insights into tailoring MOFs for improved photocatalytic applications through the incorporation of plasmonic metal nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>The Digital Economy, R&amp;amp;D Investments, and CO2 Emissions: Unraveling Reduction Potentials in China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/rsee2010004</link>
      <description>Yuexin Zhao, Peng Wang, Regional science and environmental economics. 2(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406324801

                This study explores the relationships between the digital economy, R&amp;D investment, and carbon emissions, as well as the mediating role of financial technology (fintech). Despite a growing body of research, the impact of the digital economy on carbon emissions remains contested, partly due to the limited scope and inconsistent measures in existing studies. Additionally, while R&amp;D is a pivotal driver of modern development, its potential quadratic effects on carbon emissions in China remain unexplored. By employing a comprehensive Digital Economy Index and analyzing panel data from 2011 to 2020 across Chinese regions, this study provides new insights into how digitalization and innovation influence carbon emissions. The findings reveal a positive linear correlation between the digital economy and CO2 emissions over the last decade. Moreover, R&amp;D investments exhibit an inverse U-shaped relationship with emissions, acting as an effective factor in reducing CO2 emissions. Notably, the turning point of this relationship occurs in Quadrant I, where most regions are clustered, indicating substantial efficiency gains from early-stage R&amp;D investments and their significant potential to enhance sustainable development. Furthermore, fintech emerges as a significant mediator in the R&amp;D&#8211;emissions dynamic, underscoring its critical role in this context.</description>

      <description>Younesse El Menyari, International Journal of Euro-Mediterranean Studies. 17(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406530139

                In this study, we examine the influence of international tourism, trade, foreign direct investment, economic growth and renewable energy consumption on CO2 emissions in 17 Mediterranean countries, spanning the period 1995&#8211;2018, by using heterogeneous panel estimation techniques. The findings show that economic growth has a strong impact on carbon dioxide emissions. Our results are in favor of the existence of an inverted U-shaped Environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in Mediterranean countries. In addition, the econometric results indicate that international tourism, trade openness, FDI, and renewable energy consumption have a negative impact on carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, the Dumitrescu and Hurlin panel Granger causality test suggests that there is a two-way causality between CO2 emissions and the other variables explored (international tourism, openness, FDI, renewable energy consumption and real income) and a oneway causality running from renewable energy consumption and trade openness to real income. Therefore, the development of international trade in the field of renewable energies and the exploitation of theseenergies in the field of tourism and FDI can be favorable to economic growth and the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions.</description>

      <title>ELECTRIFICATION OF A HEAVY-DUTY OFF-ROAD MATERIAL HANDLER: ENERGY SAVINGS AND EMISSION REDUCTIONS</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.37099/mtu.dc.etdr/1843</link>

                Federal regulations are driving the adoption of electrification technologies to reduce carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions, a metric that quantifies the global warming potential of various greenhouse gases in terms of carbon dioxide (CO2). Although no specific CO2 regulations exist for heavy-duty off-road machines, future reductions are likely, given stricter emissions standards for on-road vehicles. The heavy-duty off-road sector offers significant fuel-saving potential, as its focus has traditionally been on reliability and performance rather than fuel efficiency. This dissertation examines fuel and CO2e savings opportunities on a heavy-duty off-road material handler, the Pettibone Cary-Lift 204i, from stock configuration to simple modifications to a complete teardown and reconfiguration of the machine with a plug-in series hybrid architecture using electrified hydraulics.</description>

      <title>CO2 injection modeling in a reservoir: Phase transition study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.55592/cilamce.v6i06.8248</link>
      <description>Rafael de Lima Omena, Jonathan da Cunha Teixeira, Moacyr Roberto Cuc&#234; Nobre, Bernardo Jos&#233; Lucas Ferro Moreira, Matheus Santos, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406372091

                The study explores the phase transition of carbon dioxide from liquid to gas after injection and storage in a confined aquifer at a temperature of 30&#176;C. By utilizing a compositional isotropic model and data from the NIST webbook (Linstrom and Mallard, 2024), the simulation analyzes, using compositional mesh model in tNavigator software (by Rock Flow Dynamics), the behavior of CO2 within a confined aquifer, seeking to identify the phase transition of the fluid. The effects of capillarity are neglected, and the main parameters of the reservoir are a pressure of 65 bar at the wellhead and a constant temperature of 31&#176;C throughout the aquifer to evaluate the phase transition close to the supercritical point of CO2. The analysis reveals that the drastic pressure reduction within the confined aquifer leads to the formation of free gas within the reservoir after the closure of injection wells, which becomes a problem, as occurred in the Ordos CCS Project in China, allowing fluid backflow during non-injection (CAI, Yuna et al.). The results showed that the closer the temperature approaches the supercritical point of CO2, the greater the probability of free gas formation within the reservoir. Therefore, the conclusions emphasize the impact of the pressure reduction on the stability of CO2, which will undergo a phase transition from the liquid to the gaseous state, so that free gas is generated within the reservoir. In this way, it is highlighted the importance of understanding phase transition in CO2 injection processes for effective carbon capture and storage strategies.</description>

      <title>Exploring Interconnections Among Environmental Degradation, Energy Consumption, Information and Communication Technology, and Total Factor Productivity in Iran</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5829/ijee.2025.16.03.12</link>
      <description>, Iranica Journal of Energy and Environment. 16(03)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406367433

                Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is recognized as a critical driver of economic development in the modern era, significantly enhancing the productivity of production factors. However, the widespread adoption of ICT, particularly in countries reliant on fossil fuels, may contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2). So, this study investigates the interconnections among ICT, CO2, renewable energy, and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in Iran. This descriptive-analytical and applied study used time series data from the World Bank and Iran Statistics Center from 2000 to 2023. This study, the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to evaluate the long-term and short-term dynamic, unit root tests and diagnostic tests CUSUM and CUSUMQ and Canonical Co-Integrating Regression (CCR) Dynamic least squares (DOLS), and fully modified least squares (FMOLS) have been used to validate the results of ADRL estimates. The results of the ARDL estimation method showed that in the long run, TFP and economic growth on carbon dioxide had a coefficient of 0.07 and 0.14, respectively. Renewable energy consumption with a coefficient of -0.0808 had a significant negative role in reducing carbon dioxide. The coefficient of -0.286 obtained for the ICT variable at 95% indicates a reduction in carbon dioxide in parallel with the development of ICT. CUSUM and CUSUMQ confirmed the stability of the parameters, and CCR, DOLS, and FMOLS regressions confirmed the results of the ADRL model. The study recommends adopting green technologies and effective energy policies to balance productivity gains with environmental protection.</description>

      <title>The Impact of gas impurities on CO2 storage in depleted oil field with carbonate reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.31705/iserme.2024.40</link>
      <description>A. Muer, Yogarajah Elakneswaran, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406483725

                The carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is considered as a promising technology for carbon dioxide emission reduction. High-purity CO2 mixture gas is separated from the flue gas and pumped into underground for a long-term storage. The impurities of gas can affect the trapping mechanisms. Various research studies about how impurity changes permeability were carried out. However, the effect of impurities in long-term trapping mechanisms is still unclear. This research studies the effects of H2S, SO2, and NO2 in CCS for a long-term period of 2000 years using a PHREEQC geochemical simulator. The simulation presents formation water and rock samples from the previous research and the mixture gas groups to emphasis the effect of each impurity. The simulation contains two parts: the equilibrium block and the kinetics block. The former is to simulate the reversible reaction between the pure phases and the aqueous phase, which is defined by the equilibrium constant and dependent on the temperature. The latter is to simulate how phases react by time defined by kinetics rate, which is defined by the Arrhenius equation and depends on the pH, temperature, surface area and other reaction condition constants. Firstly, the gas and formation water are input into the equilibrium block to get CO2 enriched solution and remaining gas components. Then, the remaining gas and solution and mineralogy are put into the kinetics block. Results indicate a shift from mineral trapping to solubility trapping in the presence of impurities, with a significant decrease in pH affecting CO2 storage ratios. Furthermore, the changes in each mineralogy and the effects of each impurity are discussed</description>

                The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) presents a promising solution for mitigating CO2 emissions while producing valuable chemical feedstocks. Although single&#8208;atom catalysts have shown potential in selectively converting CO2 to CH4, their limited active sites often hinder the realization of high current densities, posing a selectivity&#8208;activity dilemma. In this study, we developed a single&#8208;atom cobalt (Co) doped copper catalyst (Co1Cu) that achieved a CH4 Faradaic efficiency exceeding 60% with a partial current density of &#8208;482.7 mA cm&#8208;2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the incorporation of single Co atoms enhances the activation and dissociation of H2O molecules, thereby lowering the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of *CO intermediates. In situ spectroscopic experiments and density functional theory simulations further demonstrated that the modulation of the *CO adsorption configuration, with stronger bridge&#8208;binding, favours deep reduction to CH4 over the C&#8208;C coupling or CO desorption pathways. Our findings underscore the potential of Co1Cu catalysts in overcoming the selectivity&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off, paving the way for efficient and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion technologies.</description>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction is crucial in combatting climate change and advancing sustainable energy practices by converting CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels, thereby reducing atmospheric CO2 levels and enabling the storage and utilization of renewable energy from intermittent sources like solar and wind. The selection of electrode materials and platform design plays a critical role in enhancing reaction efficiency and product selectivity during CO2 reduction. Various metals, both in their solid forms and coated over substrates, have been used in electrochemical CO2RR. In this study, we utilized electrodeposition to modify the plastic chip electrode (PCE), depositing lead metal onto it through a galvanostatic method at a current density of 100 mA/cm2 from a 0.1 M Pb(NO3)2 aqueous solution. Pb-coated electrodes are crucial due to their high selectivity, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and flexibility as electrode materials. Their good stability and durability make them ideal for long-term applications. The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide using the Pb/PCE electrode as the cathode has been investigated, focusing on assessing how different electrolysis potentials influenced the faradaic efficiency of formic acid production. Our results demonstrated that the peak faradaic efficiency, reaching 86.2%, was achieved at &#8722;0.7 V vs RHE over a 5 h electrolysis period.</description>

      <title>Effects of Elevated CO2 on Maize Physiological and Biochemical Processes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy15010202</link>
      <description>Pirzada Khan, Tariq Aziz, Rahmatullah Jan, Kyung&#8208;Min Kim, Agronomy. 15(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406424280

                Maize (Zea mays) is a critical global crop, serving as a source of food, livestock feed, and industrial raw materials. Climate changes, driven by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, have substantial effects on maize physiology, growth, and nutrient content. This review investigates the impact of elevated CO2 on maize, with a particular focus on photosynthesis enhancement as it improves water use efficiency (WUE), which can lead to increased biomass production. Despite this, elevated CO2 results in a decreased concentration of essential nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and folate. The reduction in folate, which is vital for both plant development and human nutrition, poses challenges, especially for population heavily reliant on maize. Additionally, biofortification through traditional breeding and genetic engineering is proposed as a strategy to enhance folate level in maize to mitigate nutritional deficiencies. Elevated CO2 stimulates lignin production, improving stress resistance and carbon sequestration capacity. However, the increase in guaiacyl-rich lignin may negatively affect biomass degradability and efficiency in biofuel production. The findings emphasize the importance of balancing maize&#8217;s stress resilience, nutrient profile, and lignin composition to address future climate challenges. This balance is essential for optimizing maize cultivation for food security, biofuel production, and environmental sustainability.</description>

      <title>Digital finance, institutional quality, and carbon dioxide emissions in Africa</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1080/17565529.2025.2452435</link>

                The impact of digital finance on carbon dioxide emissions has generated conflicting findings, with some studies suggesting emissions reduction while others point to the contrary. To gain clarity amidst this contradictory evidence, examining the moderating role of institutional quality is crucial. This research delved into the intricate relationship between digital finance, institutional quality, and CO2 emissions across 45 African countries from 2004 to 2021. By employing the dynamic system-generalized method of moment (sys-GMM) technique, the study revealed a positive relationship between digital finance and CO2 emissions. However, a key discovery emerged as the analysis considered the moderating role of institutional quality. The results highlighted the significant decrease in CO2 emissions that results from the interaction between institutional quality and digital finance. Furthermore, there is a critical point at which well-established institutions start to offset the environmental consequences associated with digital finance. The positive impact of digital finance on emissions is mitigated when institutions reach a certain threshold level of quality.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Approach to CO2 Emissions Analysis in High-Human-Development-Index Countries Using Statistical and Time Series Approaches</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su17020603</link>
      <description>Hamed Khosravi, Ahmed Shoyeb Raihan, Farzana Islam, Ashish D. Nimbarte, Imtiaz Ahmed, Sustainability. 17(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406363296

                Reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is vital at both global and national levels, given their significant role in exacerbating climate change. CO2 emissions, stemming from a variety of industrial and economic activities, are major contributors to the greenhouse effect and global warming, posing substantial obstacles in addressing climate issues. It is imperative to forecast CO2 emissions trends and classify countries based on their emission patterns to effectively mitigate worldwide carbon emissions. This paper presents an in-depth comparative study on the determinants of CO2 emissions in twenty countries with high Human Development Index (HDI), exploring factors related to economy, environment, energy use, and renewable resources over a span of 25 years. The study unfolds in two distinct phases: initially, statistical techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), fixed effects, and random effects models are applied to pinpoint significant determinants of CO2 emissions. Following this, the study leverages supervised and unsupervised time series approaches to further scrutinize and understand the factors influencing CO2 emissions. Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous variables (SARIMAX), a statistical time series forecasting model, is first used to predict emission trends from historical data, offering practical insights for policy formulation. Subsequently, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), an unsupervised time series clustering approach, is used to group countries by similar emission patterns. The dual-phase approach utilized in this study significantly improves the accuracy of CO2 emissions predictions while also providing a deeper insight into global emission trends. By adopting this thorough analytical framework, nations can develop more focused and effective carbon reduction policies, playing a vital role in the global initiative to combat climate change.</description>

                The catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methanol over Cu/ZnO catalysts is expected to become valuable for recycling CO2. The nature of the Cu&#8211;Zn interplay remains a subject of intense debate due to many different Zn species encountered in Cu/ZnO catalysts. In this study, we designed a Cu&#8211;Zn catalyst by ion-exchanging Cu into CIT-6, a crystalline microporous zincosilicate with the BEA* topology. The catalyst exhibited high and stable CO2 hydrogenation rate to methanol. In contrast, its aluminosilicate counterparts Cu-Beta and CuZn-Beta mainly converted CO2 to CO. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy combined with X-ray diffraction confirmed the stability of Zn cations in the zincosilicate framework during reduction in H2 and reaction in CO2/H2. The active phase consisted of highly dispersed Cu particles. These particles located near isolated Zn2+ species represent a different type of active site for methanol synthesis than the active phases proposed for Cu&#8211;Zn catalysts, such as Cu&#8211;Zn alloy particles and Cu particles decorated with ZnOx. In situ IR spectroscopy showed the formation of Zn-formate species during CO2 hydrogenation, indicating that Zn2+ ions stabilize formate as a reaction intermediate in the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol.</description>

      <title>Carbon Trading as a New Paradigm for Indonesia's Polluter Pays Principle</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.15294/jllr.vol5i1.2090</link>
      <description>Erwin Syahruddin, Rahmat Saputra, Andre Cardenas, Alizah Ali, Journal of Law and Legal Reform. 5(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406375602

                Climate change is driven by a combination of natural fluctuations and human activities, particularly the widespread use of fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas) and alterations in land use practices such as logging, farming, and clearing land for agriculture. This global phenomenon encompasses various end-of-use activities, including agriculture, forestry, and consumerism. An inherent challenge in the global carbon dioxide (CO2) trading landscape lies in the competition between developed and developing countries, stemming from inconsistent CO2 prices. This competition manifests in three primary areas. Firstly, in the context of internationally transmitted mitigation outcomes, involving international trade aimed at surpassing Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) targets. Secondly, it pertains to sustainable development mechanisms, specifically the use of carbon offsets derived from projects implemented by both public and private entities worldwide. The third aspect revolves around non-market approaches, encompassing emission reduction through mitigation and adaptation efforts, financial support, technology transfer, and capacity building, which may involve tools like carbon taxes and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). This research adopts a legal norm perspective, delving into methods that investigate, describe, synthesize, interpret, evaluate, and analyze positive approaches. The findings signify a paradigm shift aligning with the "polluter pays principle," recognizing that entities and individuals responsible for environmental pollution should bear the associated costs. In the quest for a new paradigm of sustainable development, a carbon market ecosystem assumes a pivotal role. This ecosystem contributes to enhancing sustainability by curbing greenhouse gas emissions and offering economic incentives to address climate change. It acts as a cornerstone in constructing a fresh paradigm for potential development.</description>

      <title>Process simulation for biogas upgrading and biomethane recovery using biofilm-based reactors</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3384/ecp212.037</link>
      <description>Vafa Ahmadi, Aryan Bhusal, Gamunu L Samarakoon Arachchige, Nabin Aryal, Link&#246;ping electronic conference proceedings. 211(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406473498

                Microbial biofilm matrices offer numerous benefits in bioprocessing and are crucial in various industrial and remediation processes. They facilitate electron exchange from solid surfaces when they interact with the environment. Emerging technologies such as biofilm-containing trickle bed reactors (TBR) and bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) for carbon dioxide (CO2) utilization, mostly rely on microbial biofilm matrices. Metabolic modeling of biofilm-based reactors enables detailed analysis of CO2 reduction within microorganisms, enhancing reactor efficiency. This study employed simulation models to analyze biomethane synthesis within TBR and BES systems. AQUASIM simulation tool was used for conducting the simulation. Parameters such as non-stoichiometric and stoichiometric ratios of substrates, hydraulic retention time (HRT), biofilm surface area, and applied voltage in BES were varied to evaluate methane (CH4) production and microbial biomass growth in TBR and BES. Results demonstrated that 1 day HRT resulted in methanation process failure due to biomass development problem in both TBR and BES. The substrate ratio 1:4 of CO2 to H2 increased CH4 production in the investigated reactors. In BES, in-situ CO2 and proton (H+) generation from oxidation reactions can increase CH4 production. Whereas in TBR, external H2 (hydrogen) should be supplied to consume higher amount of CO2. The lag phase in TBR was shorter than that in BES because of the greater surface area in TBR. In BES, higher voltage increased the current generation because of development of more biomass on the cathode. The simulation underlines the influence of different variables on biofilm-based reactors, offering critical insights for experimental process design.</description>

                Climate change is a contemporary global challenge that requires comprehensive solutions to mitigate its adverse effects. All human activities contribute to climate change, mainly through atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as nitrous oxide (N2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4). While most of these emissions are primarily due to fossil fuel use, agriculture and livestock production also contribute to a significant share of approximately 12% of global emissions. Most processes that are implemented within an animal husbandry unit are associated with greenhouse gas emissions, including manure management. This review explores the interconnection between climate change and manure management practices, highlighting the potential for sustainable approaches to mitigating GHG emissions. The key strategies for manure management, such as anaerobic digestion, nutrient management, composting, manure separation and treatment, and improved storage and handling, are discussed, as they are implemented in different livestock production systems (ruminants, poultry, and pigs). Despite the technological progress, there is still a place for further improving manure management approaches, especially in non-ruminant species leading to a higher mitigation potential and a reduction in greenhouse gases emissions. Moreover, policy support and incentives for sustainable practices are crucial for widespread adoption.</description>

                Objectives . The work set out to develop a bioreactor that incorporates a carbon dioxide removal unit within the apparatus gas phase, which is capable of operating without the need for supplementary compression apparatus. As part of testing the developed equipment in order to ascertain its capacity for enhanced biomass production, the principal fermentation system parameters that facilitate the optimal bioreactor productivity in conditions of carbon dioxide removal from the apparatus gas phase were identified. Methods . A series of tests were conducted on the fermentation unit with the objective of controlling the oxygen and carbon dioxide content in the gas phase of the bioreactor. This was achieved using an in-line gas analyzer fitted with electrochemical sensors. The oxygen and carbon dioxide content in the gas phase was determined by means of gas chromatography. The oxygen and natural gas flow rates were determined using a thermal electronic flow controller equipped with thermoresistive elements. The oxygen content of the cultural liquid was determined by means of an optical oxygen sensor with integrated transducer. The pH level in the bioreactor was monitored and maintained using an electrochemical pH sensor. Results . The efficacy of the newly devised jet-type bioreactor design, which permits the incorporation of a carbon dioxide removal unit into the fermentation system without requiring supplementary compression apparatus, was evaluated through experimentation. The system was tested with the carbon dioxide removal unit included in the design, resulting in a 64% increase in bioreactor productivity and a 18% reduction in oxygen consumption as a component of the gas supply. Conclusions . The operational parameters of a technological bioreactor that facilitate a stable continuous process of bacterial cultivation were identified.</description>

                Abstract The energy sector contributes significantly to carbon dioxide emissions, and speeding up the shift to a low-carbon power system is essential for tackling global warming. This paper introduces a method for low-carbon economic scheduling that considers the marginal carbon emission factor to improve carbon reduction. First, the marginal carbon emission factor encourages users to adjust their energy plans. A demand response model for pre-scheduling and rescheduling within the grid is developed using price-based strategies. Second, a two-stage model is created to optimize low-carbon scheduling and minimize overall system costs. The method&#8217;s effectiveness is demonstrated using the IEEE39-node grid.</description>

Forests, river preservation, vegetated areas, and biodiversity affect absolutely all spheres of life. Destroying or even changing a small part of biodiversity can have severe adverse consequences. From the climate protection perspective, forests play an important role as carbon dioxide absorbers. However, the reduction of forest areas leads to the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Natural Environmental Contaminants and the Impact of Green Technologies on Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.33002/jelp040309</link>
      <description>Awodezi Henry, Ikechukwu Kwubosu, Journal of Environmental Law &amp; Policy. 04(03)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406334151

                Environment has been defined as the natural world in which living things dwell and grow. There are certain factors which often pose challenges to the environment and are capable of interrupting capacity building as well as sustainability. This research evaluates such factors as environmental contaminants which include any chemical, biological, or radiological substance or matter that hurts air, water, soil or living organisms. However, with the advancement of green technologies on the environment, there is a revolutionary change with regards to clean energy production, solar power, reduction of emissions of carbon dioxide, use of alternative fuels and other technologies that are less harmful to the environment than fossil fuels. This research focuses on clean energy production such as solar energy and other technologies that serve the best purpose of reducing emissions of carbon dioxide usually generated by vehicles, motorcycles and fuel power generators majorly in the cities, particularly in the industrial environments. These emissions from vehicle engines, power generators, gas flaring and other environmental contaminants are very dangerous to human health. Many, who have ingested these emissions, have serious interference with their bodies&#8217; internal functioning, causing diseases like cancer, itching in the eyes and respiratory disorders like asthma. The pressing need to explore green technologies for sustainability becomes imperative and this gave rise to this research. To achieve this aim, this research adopts the doctrinal research methodology in examining the natural environmental contaminants and the impact of green technologies on climate change. On this premise, this research recommends tremendous exploration of green technologies as a recipe for a sustainable environment.</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) electrosynthesis via the 2e &#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is considered as a cost&#8208;effective and safe alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process. However, in more practical environments, namely, the use of neutral media and air&#8208;fed cathode environments, slow ORR kinetics and insufficient oxygen supply pose significant challenges to efficient H 2 O 2 production at high current densities. In this work, mesoporous B&#8208;doped carbons with novel curved B 4 C active sites, synthesized via a carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction using a pore&#8208;former agent, to simultaneously achieve excellent 2e &#8722; ORR activity and improved mass transfer properties are introduced. Through a combination of experimental analysis and theoretical calculations, it is confirmed that the curved B 4 C configuration, formed by mesopores in the carbon, demonstrates superior selectivity and activity for 2e &#8722; ORR due to its weaker interaction with *OOH intermediates compared to planar B 4 C in neutral media. Moreover, the mesopores facilitate oxygen supply and suppress the hydrogen evolution reaction, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 86.2% at 150 mA cm &#8722;2 under air&#8208;supplied conditions, along with an impressive O 2 utilization efficiency of 93.6%. This approach will provide a route to catalyst design for efficient H 2 O 2 electrosynthesis in a practical environment.</description>

                Abstract The atomic dispersion of nickel in Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts is key for the selective generation of carbon monoxide through the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). Herein, the study reports a highly selective, atomically dispersed Ni 1.0% &#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst with reduced Ni loading compared to previous reports. Extensive materials characterization fails to detect Ni crystalline phases, reveals the highest concentration of atomically dispersed Ni metal, and confirms the presence of the proposed Ni&#8208;N x active site at this reduced loading. The catalyst shows excellent activity and selectivity toward CO generation, with a faradaic efficiency for CO generation (FE CO ) of 97% and partial current density for CO (j co ) of &#8208;9.0 mA cm &#8722;2 at &#8208;0.9 V in an electrochemical H&#8208;type cell. CO 2 RR activity and selectivity are also studied by rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements where transport limitations can be suppressed. It is expected that the utility of these Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalysts will lie with tandem CO 2 RR reaction schemes to multi&#8208;carbon (C 2+ ) products.</description>

                Injection of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) is used in fields with high amount of residual oil. CO2-EOR refers to a technology where supercritical CO2 is injected into an oil reservoir to increase the oil production. Utilizing autonomous inflow control valves (AICVs) in CO2-EOR projects contributes to a better distribution of CO2 in the reservoir, reduction in production of water and CO2 mixture, and thereby increased storage capacity of CO2. The main objective of this study is modelling and simulation of oil production from an oil reservoir using CO2 water alternating gas (CO2 WAG) injection in combination with advanced wells that are completed with AICVs. The results from the simulations indicate that well completion with AICV can maintain good oil production while the production of water is decreased from 3e+06 m3 to 9.8e+04 m3 which corresponds to 97% reduction in water production. The sensitivity analysis of the simulation results affirms that permeability, well placement, and well spacing have impact on oil recovery and water production. The results indicate that permeability increase has a slight increment effect on oil recovery. The well spacing analysis shows that increasing the distance between the wells will increase the oil recovery and delay the water breakthrough. Lastly the well placement analysis shows that vertical injection of miscible CO2 produces more oil than horizontal injection of miscible CO2. AICVs restrict the production of mixture of CO2 and water, and thereby cause a better distribution of CO2 in the reservoir.</description>

      <title>Linking Radiative&#8208;Advective Equilibrium Regime Transition to Arctic Amplification</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2024gl113417</link>

                Abstract Emission of anthropogenic greenhouse gases has resulted in greater Arctic warming compared to global warming, known as Arctic amplification (AA). From an energy&#8208;balance perspective, the current Arctic climate is in radiative&#8208;advective equilibrium (RAE) regime, in which radiative cooling is balanced by advective heat flux convergence. Exploiting a suite of climate model simulations with varying carbon dioxide () concentrations, we link the northern high&#8208;latitude regime variation and transition to AA. The dominance of RAE regime in northern high&#8208;latitudes under reduction relates to stronger AA, whereas the RAE regime transition to non&#8208;RAE regime under increase corresponds to a weaker AA. Examinations on the spatial and seasonal structures reveal that lapse&#8208;rate and sea&#8208;ice processes are crucial mechanisms. Our findings suggest that if concentration continues to rise, the Arctic could transition into a non&#8208;RAE regime accompanied with a weaker AA.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Steel Furnaces and boilers Emissions with and without Emission Control System (ECS)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.57041/vol76iss03pp348-351</link>
      <description>Imran Sheikh, Nafeesa Naz, Fiaz Hussa&#305;n, Maryam Arshad, Mohammad Firoz Alam, Rizwan Haider, Tahira Yaqoob, Pakistan Journal of Science. 76(03)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406377219

                In this study, emissions from boilers and steel furnaces with and without emission control systems (ECS), more especially wet scrubbers, were assessed. The concentrations of PM, SO&#8322;, and NO&#8339; were determined using an isokinetic assembly for particulate matter (PM) monitoring and a flue gas analyzer for CO, NOX and SO&#8322; monitoring. The efficacy of the wet scrubber in capturing airborne particles was demonstrated by the remarkable 70% reduction in PM emissions observed in the steel furnace findings. There was no discernible change in CO2 levels, and emissions of SOx and NOx were reduced by 15% and 16%, respectively, but CO emissions only dropped by 3.31%. With a reduction of 70.22% in SOx emissions, the wet scrubber proved to be the most efficient in lowering emissions of NOx (30.79%) and PM (27.75%) in the context of boilers. CO2 levels marginally increased while CO emissions declined by 17.75%. In general, the wet scrubber demonstrated significant efficacy in mitigating pollutants, including PM and SOx; however, its influence on CO and CO2 was restricted.</description>

                Abstract The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (eCO 2 R) to formate is a promising technology for CO 2 utilization and potential industrial application. Despite extensive research on catalyst layer design, interpreting performance is often hindered by the complexity of composite layers. In this study, plasma&#8208;enhanced and thermal Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) are employed to fabricate In 2 S 3 thin films on gas diffusion electrodes, creating model catalyst layers without ionomers or binders. The uniform ALD films enables fine&#8208;tuning of hydrophobicity, underscoring its critical role at the triple&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) and enhancing formate production via eCO 2 R at high current densities. For example, a thermal ALD&#8208;deposited In 2 S 3 thin film (150 &#181;g cm &#8722;2 ) achieved a formate Faradaic efficiency of 93% at 1 A cm &#8722;2 . The system exhibits high selectivity, with minimal hydrogen evolution and carbon monoxide as the sole by&#8208;product, facilitating the determination of key electrokinetic parameters such as exchange and limiting current densities. Reaction kinetic modeling further clarified the influence of hydrophobicity on these parameters. This work provides valuable insights into the role of interfacial properties in electrocatalysis, advancing the development of efficient electrocatalysts and processes for industrial formate production.</description>

                The corrected abstract is as follows.This article aims to study the benzyl alcohol premixing effect on the 5E concept of compression ignition engines powered with a lemongrass oil-diesel blend. The central composite approach is used to create the experimental matrix for the load (50&#8211;100%) and benzyl alcohol premixing ratio (0&#8211;20%). The experiment uses a computerized compression ignition, water-cooled, single-cylinder, naturally aspirated, four-stroke engine. The statistical model is tested using analysis of variance and confirmed at the 95% confidence level. Quadratic and linear models are created, and regression equations provide surface plots to analyse load&#8211;premixing ratio interaction on output response. Premixing of benzyl alcohol at 20% at maximum loads confirms 31.09%, 14.95%, 31.09%, 39.91%, 17.26%, 11.06%, 7.59%, 36.61%, and 4.34% higher enviroeconomic loss, thermal efficiency, brake-specific carbon dioxide, brake-specific nitrogen monoxide, cooling water exergy, sustainability index, volumetric efficiency, and exhaust gas temperature. It also has lower exergoeconomic loss, thermoeconomic loss, brake-specific energy consumption, brake-specific carbon monoxide, smoke opacity, brake-specific hydrocarbon fuel exergy, exhaust gas exergy, destructed exergy, and entropy generation by 23.64%, 30.4%, 17.50%, 13.6%, 81.30%, 18.1%, 27.77%, and 27.77%, respectively. It is necessary to control nitrogen monoxide using exhaust gas recirculation or selective catalytic reduction technology in future work.</description>

                The reduction of CO2 to CO provides a promising approach to the production of valuable chemicals through CO2 utilization. However, challenges persist with the rapid deactivation and insufficient activity of catalysts. Herein, we developed a soft&#8208;hard dual&#8208;template method to synthesize layered MoS2 using inexpensive and scalable templates, enabling facile regulation of sulfur vacancies by controlling the number of layers. The concentration of in&#8208;plane vacancies keeps increasing with the reduction of MoS2 layer number, contributing to 100% CO selectivity over single&#8208;layer MoS2 and a stable performance over 300&#8208;hour reaction at 600 &#176;C. The space&#8208;time&#8208;yield of CO reached 35.7 gCO gcat&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, outperforming most current catalysts. Multiple characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that in&#8208;plane sulfur vacancy sites endowed enhanced production of CO via direct dissociation of CO2, showing an intrinsic activity of above 5.8 times higher than that of edge sulfur vacancy sites. The rate&#8208;limiting step was shifted from C&#8208;O cleavage in edge to sulfur vacancy regeneration in plane with a lower energy barrier. Our findings exemplified the specified design and synthesis of MoS2 for high&#8208;temperature CO2 reduction through the effective manipulation of distinct vacancy sites, shedding light on their potential industrial application.</description>

                ABSTRACT It will significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions by incorporating natural polymers into eco&#8208;friendly composites. Improving compatibility in eco&#8208;friendly composites is essential for enhancing their mechanical properties for broad applications. In this study, we synthesized a unique structured polyurethane prepolymer (PBAPU) and utilized it as a compatibilizer. We then mixed varying amounts of PBAPU with PBAT and SPI to produce a series of PBAT/SPI composites and subsequently investigated their structure and properties. The PBAT/SPI composites, with the addition of 15% compatibilizer, saw their tensile elongation increase by 207% and their impact strength improve by 236%, showing that the addition of PBAPU enhanced the mechanical properties of the composites. Furthermore, the scanning electron microscopy images revealed a reduction in cracks and gaps at the PBAT/SPI interface, with a more uniform dispersion, indicating a significant enhancement in the compatibility of the composites. The strong urethane linkage interactions between the PBAPU interfacial layer and SPI, as well as the crystalline PBA&#8208;PBA interactions between the PBAPU interfacial layer and the PBAT matrix, are the reasons for the improved compatibility of the PBAT/SPI composites. Therefore, incorporating PBAPU with a special structure enhances the compatibility and performance of the PBAT/SPI composites.</description>

      <title>Carbon emission of urban vehicles based on carbon emission factor correlation analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-86119-3</link>

                The CO2 emission factor is the basis for analyzing vehicle CO2 emissions. This study establishes a correlation model between the fuel CO2 emission factor and the mileage-based CO2 emission factor using fuel consumption data, then analyzes the fuel consumption and CO2 emission situation of vehicles in Beijing with the established models. The main research conclusions are as follows: The proposed correlation models are effective for analyzing urban vehicle CO2 emissions. Cars can only meet the national standard limit when traveling at an average speed of 42.17 km/h. During rush hours, fuel consumption in most cities in China exceeds national standards, making it urgent to improve urban traffic efficiency. Due to the decline in urban traffic conditions in Beijing in 2023 (average speed decreased from 29.14 km/h to 24.26 km/h), each passenger car consumes an average of 0.282 L more gasoline per day, emitting an additional 619.87 g of CO2. This study is of great significance for energy conservation and emission reduction in road transportation.</description>

      <title>Antibacterial Efficacy Comparison of Electrolytic and Reductive Silver Nanoparticles Against Propionibacterium acnes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics14010086</link>

                Background: The aim of this study was to develop an electrolysis system to produce silver nanoparticles free from toxic gases, as the most common reduction and electrolysis techniques produce nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as a byproduct, which is harmful to human health. The new electrolysis system used two identical silver plate electrodes, replacing silver and carbon rods, and used water as the electrolyte instead of silver nitrate (AgNO3) solution since AgNO3 is the source of NO2. Methods: The electrolytic silver nanoparticles (ESNs) produced by the new system were characterized and compared with reductive silver nanoparticles (RSNs). Using UV&#8211;Visible spectrophotometry, absorption peaks were found at 425 nm (ESN) and 437 nm (RSN). Using dynamic light scattering, the particle diameters were measured at 40.3 nm and 39.9 nm for ESNs at concentrations of 10 ppm and 30 ppm, respectively, and 74.0 nm and 74.6 nm for RSNs at concentrations of 10 ppm and 30 ppm, respectively. Antibacterial activity against Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) was assessed using the Kirby&#8211;Bauer method. Results: It was found that the efficacy of ESNs and RSNs was relatively lower than that of 5% chloramphenicol because it was measured in different concentration units (ESNs and RSNs in ppm and chloramphenicol in %). Using the calibration curve, the efficacy of 5% chloramphenicol was comparable to that of 0.005% ESN. It was also found that P. acnes developed a strong resistance to chloramphenicol and showed no resistance to ESNs. Conclusions: This finding underlines the tremendous potential of ESNs as a future antibiotic raw material.</description>

                The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to value-added chemicals represents a critical strategy for mitigating carbon emissions and promoting energy sustainability. This study focuses on enhancing the CO2 reduction performance of copper-based catalysts through silver doping, with the specific objective of improving C2+ product selectivity and suppressing C1 products. We report the delicate synthesis of three distinct CuAg Janus nanostructures using a coreduction method involving metal precursors for nucleation and growth. Compared to Cu NPs, CuAg Janus 1:0.02 exhibits significantly superior selectivity for both C2H4 (&#8764;50%) and multicarbon products (&#8764;70%) at &#8722;1.2 V vs RHE in CO2RR. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis reveals that the CuAg Janus nanostructure facilitates an electron transfer process, significantly influencing the catalytic activity and product selectivity of the CO2 reduction reaction. In-situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy spectra indicate that CuAg Janus nanoparticles promote the formation of *CHO and *COCHO, which are key intermediates in the production of C2H4 and enhancement of C&#8211;C coupling. This study provides an effective strategy for designing advanced tandem catalysts, paving the way for the widespread application of the CO2RR in addressing environmental and energy challenges.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Confinement Effects on the Dynamical Aspects of CO Oxidation over Pt(111)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c06593</link>

                This study investigates the effects of two-dimensional (2D) confinement on CO oxidation reaction over Pt(111) surfaces, emphasizing the structural, electronic, and dynamical aspects of CO2 formation and desorption. Using pristine and single-defect hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as overlayers, we found that confinement by nitrogen-vacancy h-BN (NV) induces a significant reduction, greater than that of graphene (Gr), in the activation energy barrier for CO2 formation. The confinement effect on adsorption depends on the reference states chosen for adsorption energy calculations. Reference states, such as stable or original intersurface gaps, can yield either positive or negative confinement energy values, indicating adsorption weakening or strengthening, respectively. Importantly, adsorption weakening correlates better with barrier reduction. Post-transition-state dynamical simulations of CO2 desorption revealed pronounced vibrational oscillations. NV and Gr confinement led to complex vibrational features, indicating stronger interactions between CO2 and the 2D cover. This study highlights the profound impact of 2D confinement on catalytic processes, providing insights into how 2D materials modulate the electronic structure and vibrational dynamics of reactions. The findings could guide the design of efficient catalysts for industrial applications, particularly in heterogeneous catalysis.</description>

                The mechanisms of NO reduction by CO over nitrogen-doped graphene (N-graphene)-supported single-atom Ni catalysts in the presence of O2, H2O, CO2, and SO2 have been studied via density functional theory (DFT) modeling. The catalyst is represented by a single Ni atom bonded to four N atoms on N-graphene. Several alternative reaction pathways, including adsorption of NO on the Ni site, direct reduction of NO by CO, decomposition of NO to N2O followed by reduction of N2O to N2, formation of active oxygen radical O*, and reduction of O* by CO, were hypothesized and the energy barrier corresponding to each of the reaction steps was calculated using DFT. The most probable pathway was found to be that NO adsorbed on the Ni site decomposes via the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism to form N2O and subsequently N2, leaving an active oxygen radical (O*) on the surface, which is then reduced by CO. The large adsorption energy of NO on the Ni site results in strong resistance to CO2, SO2, O2, and water vapor. The activation energy of N2O reduction to N2 was found to be larger than those of NO decomposition to N2O and active oxygen radical reduction by CO, illustrating that the step of N2O reduced to N2 is the rate-controlling step.</description>

                Using data from 2003 to 2019 for China&#8217;s 257 cities, this quantitative research utilizes the difference-in-differences approach to evaluate the synergy of the Comprehensive Demonstration Cities of Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Fiscal Policy on pollution and carbon reduction. The primary results are as follows. The policy successfully reduces total emissions of industrial SO2, industrial wastewater, and CO2, thus achieving the desired synergistic effect of pollution and carbon reduction. Facilitating green technological innovation and promoting industrial upgrading are the transmission mechanisms through which the synergistic effect of the policy operates. The negative effect of the policy on the total emissions of industrial SO2 and CO2 is greater in the eastern area than in the mid-western area and the impact of the policy on decreasing the total emissions of industrial SO2 is more pronounced in non-resource-based cities compared to resource-based cities. This study provides an empirical reference for green fiscal policy with respect to reducing air pollution, wastewater pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical conversion of CO2 to CO is demonstrated with symmetric-structured metal supported solid oxide cells (MS-SOC). Perovskite Pr0.5Sr0.4Mn0.2Fe0.8O3-&#948; (PSMF) and Pr6O11 catalysts were infiltrated into the MS-SOC cathode and anode, using 3 cycles with firing at 850&#61616;C and 8 cycles with firing at 800&#61616;C, respectively. Upon reduction during operation, the perovskite PSMF was transformed to Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper structure with a highly efficient electrocatalytic activity. The impact of operating temperature (600-800&#61616;C) and overpotential (0-1.8 V) on the CO2 conversion was investigated. The highest CO2 conversion of 57.2% was achieved at 750&#61616;C and 1.8 V. During extended operation for 150 h at 750&#61616;C and 1.2V, a cell demonstrated relatively stable performance, with initial current density of 535 mA cm-2 and CO2 conversion of 23%. Degradation mechanisms were studied by posttest characterization.</description>

                Electricity-powered C&#9472;C coupling of CO2 represents an attractive strategy for producing valuable commodity chemicals with renewable energy, but it is still challenging to gain high C2+ selectivity at high current density. Here, a Sn1Cu single-atom alloy (SAA) is reported with isolated Sn atom embedded into the Cu lattice, as efficient ectrocatalyst for CO2 reduction. The as prepared Sn1Cu-SAA catalyst shows a maximal C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 79.3% at 800 mA cm-2, which can be kept stable for at least 16 h. The combination of in situ spectroscopy and DFT calculation reveal that the introduced Sn atom promote the activation of CO2 to *CO, and enhance the CO coverage on Sn1Cu-SAA. As results, the reaction barrier of C&#9472;C coupling pathway is significantly reduced, boosting the generation of C2+ products. These findings offer a novel sight for fabricating multicarbon products from CO2 via regulation the concentration of intermediates on catalytic interface.</description>

                Abstract. Independent estimation and verification of fossil CO2 emissions on a regional and national scale are crucial for evaluating the fossil CO2 emissions and reductions reported by countries as part of their nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Top-down methods, such as the assimilation of in situ and satellite observations of different tracers (e.g., CO2, CO, &#916;14CO2, XCO2), have been increasingly used for this purpose. In this paper, we use the Lund University Modular Inversion Algorithm (LUMIA) to estimate fossil CO2 emissions and natural fluxes by simultaneously inverting in situ synthetic observations of CO2 and &#916;14CO2 over Europe. We evaluate the inversion system by conducting a series of observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs). We find that in regions with a dense sampling network, such as western/central Europe, adding &#916;14CO2 observations in an experiment where the prior fossil CO2 and biosphere fluxes are set to zero allows LUMIA to recover the time series of both categories. This reduces the prior-to-truth root mean square error (RMSE) from 1.26 to 0.12 TgC d&#8722;1 in fossil CO2 and from 0.97 to 0.17 TgC d&#8722;1 in biosphere fluxes, reflecting the true total CO2 budget by 91 %. In a second set of experiments using realistic prior fluxes, we find that in addition to retrieving the time series of the optimized fluxes, we are able to recover the true regional fossil CO2 budget in western/central Europe by 95 % and in Germany by 97 %. In all experiments, regions with low sampling coverage, such as southern Europe and the British Isles, show poorly resolved posterior fossil CO2 emissions. Although the posterior biosphere fluxes in these regions follow the seasonal patterns of the true fluxes, a significant bias remains, making it impossible to close the total CO2 budget. We find that the prior uncertainty of fossil CO2 emissions does not significantly impact the posterior estimates, showing similar results in regions with good sampling coverage like western/central Europe and northern Europe. Finally, having a good prior estimate of the terrestrial isotopic disequilibrium is important to avoid introducing additional noise into the posterior fossil CO2 fluxes.</description>

      <title>Multienzymatic Platform for Coupling a CCU Strategy to Waste Valorization: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the Iron and Steel Industry and Crude Glycerol from Biodiesel Production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c04908</link>

                Ongoing climate crisis demands the development of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies that emphasize simplicity, eco-sustainability, and cost-effectiveness. Enzymatic CO2 reduction emerges as an alternative to biotransforming this cheap raw material into high-value products under milder conditions. This work proposes a multienzymatic platform to reduce CO2 to formate by formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and oxidize glycerol to dihydroxyacetone (DHA) by glycerol dehydrogenase (GlyDH), allowing for efficient cofactor regeneration. Through studies such as pH operating range, enzyme stability, FDH/GlyDH ratio, and reaction medium engineering to achieve optimal soluble CO2 concentrations, the reaction with a gas mixture of 24% CO2 yielded 5.7 mM formate and 6 mM DHA after 30 h, achieving a 92.3% CO2 conversion. To evaluate the feasibility under industrially relevant conditions, a synthetic gas mixture mimicking the composition of the iron and steel industry off-gases (24.5% CO2) and crude glycerol (64% v/v) from biodiesel production was tested as substrates. The simultaneous production was successful, yielding 3.1 mM formate and 4.4 mM DHA. Formic acid was subsequently purified using liquid&#8211;liquid extraction, employing the green solvent 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MTHF). For the first time to our knowledge, a CCU strategy has been successfully coupled with industrial waste valorization, obtaining two high-value molecules by means of a robust, profitable, and easily manageable multienzymatic system.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Framework for History Matching CO2 Storage with 4D Seismic
  and Monitoring Well Data</title>

                Geological carbon storage entails the injection of megatonnes of supercritical CO2 into subsurface formations. The properties of these formations are usually highly uncertain, which makes design and optimization of large-scale storage operations challenging. In this paper we introduce a history matching strategy that enables the calibration of formation properties based on early-time observations. Early-time assessments are essential to assure the operation is performing as planned. Our framework involves two fit-for-purpose deep learning surrogate models that provide predictions for in-situ monitoring well data and interpreted time-lapse (4D) seismic saturation data. These two types of data are at very different scales of resolution, so it is appropriate to construct separate, specialized deep learning networks for their prediction. This approach results in a workflow that is more straightforward to design and more efficient to train than a single surrogate that provides global high-fidelity predictions. The deep learning models are integrated into a hierarchical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) history matching procedure. History matching is performed on a synthetic case with and without 4D seismic data, which allows us to quantify the impact of 4D seismic on uncertainty reduction. The use of both data types is shown to provide substantial uncertainty reduction in key geomodel parameters and to enable accurate predictions of CO2 plume dynamics. The overall history matching framework developed in this study represents an efficient way to integrate multiple data types and to assess the impact of each on uncertainty reduction and performance predictions.</description>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) represents a viable strategy for converting CO2 into value-added multi-carbon (C2+) compounds. Therefore, the microstructure of the catalyst layer (CL) affects local gas transport, charge conduction, and proton supply at three-phase interfaces, which is significantly determined by the solvent environment. However, the microenvironment of the CLs and the mechanism of the solvent effect on C2+ selectivity remains elusive. Herein, a tailored interfacial structure is designed by introducing a solvent-mediated catalyst-ionomer-solvent microenvironment. The acetone surface promotion strategy is beneficial for the unfolded ionomers to uniformly coat the catalysts, which contributes to enhancing interfacial hydrophobicity and inhibiting hydrogen evolution. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and in situ ATR-SEIRAS are employed to elucidate the appropriate interfacial network with a balanced distribution of CO2 and H2O. The uniform and continuous network in acetone is advantageous for CO2-to-C2+. The optimized structure favors the production of C2+ products in Cu-based MEA, exhibiting a high C2+ faradaic efficiency (FE) of 80.27% at 400 mA cm-2.</description>

                Although membrane technology is widely used in different gas separation applications, membrane manufacturers need to reduce the environmental impact during the membrane fabrication process within the framework of the circular economy by replacing toxic solvents, oil-based polymers, and such by more sustainable alternatives. These include environmentally friendly materials, such as biopolymers, green solvents, and surfactant free porous fillers. This work promotes the use of environmentally sustainable and low toxic alternatives, introducing the novel application of cellulose acetate (CA) as a biopolymer in combination with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) as a greener solvent and different inorganic fillers (Zeolite-A, ETS-10, AM-4 and ZIF-8) prepared without the use of toxic solvents or reactants. Hansen Solubility Parameters were used to confirm the polymer&#8211;solvent affinity. Pure CA and mixed matrix membranes were characterized regarding their hydrophilicity by water uptake and contact angle measurements, thermal stability by TGA, mechanical resistance, ATR-FTIR and scanning electron microscopy before evaluating the gas separation performance by single gas permeability of N2, CH4, and CO2. Conditioning of the CA membranes is observed causing reduction of the CO2 permeability values from 12,600 Barrer for the fresh 0.5 wt % ETS-10/CA membrane to 740 Barrer for the 0.5 wt % ZIF-8/CA membranes, corresponding to 24% and 4.2% reductions in CO2/CH4 selectivity and 30% and 24% increase in CO2/N2 selectivity for the same membranes. The structure&#8211;relationship was evaluated by phenomenological models which are useful at low filler loading considering flux direction and particle shape and size but still fail to explain the interactions between the DMC green solvent and CA matrix and fillers that are influencing gas transport performance different than other CA membranes.</description>

                Expensive membrane filtration is the only solution for total dissolved solids (TDS) reduction of the waste to meet the Indian Effluent Standards. The authors have formulated a strategy of reducing the overall costs by reducing the pollutant load to the membranes using dissolved air flotation (DAF) and other innovative technologies. The innovative approach of reducing the tannery pollutant load involves (a) the segregation of the various streams (beam house waste stream, and tanyard waste stream); (b) first-stage beam house waste pretreatment: recycle of carbon dioxide in the stack flue gas for removing the protein, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) from the beam waste stream, and recovery and reuse of the recovered protein; (c) second-stage beam house waste pretreatment: addition of ferrous sulfate to the carbonation effluent for removing the sulfide, BOD, COD, and total suspended solids (TSS) and recovery of ferrous sulfide waste sludge; (d) total pollutant reduction from the overall beam house waste pretreatment: TSS (87%), COD (41.6%), BOD (39.8%), chromium (99.82%), sulfide (99.94%); (e) first-stage tanyard waste pretreatment: screening removal of large substance, TSS, etc.; (f) second-stage tanyard waste pretreatment: reuse of ferrous sulfide waste sludge for the removal of toxic chromium and other heavy metals and, in turn, the release of ferrous ions; reuse of ferrous ions as coagulant; and separation of chromium sulfide sludge, BOD, COD, and TSS by DAF; (g) total pollutant reduction from the overall tanyard waste pretreatment: TSS (93.2%), COD (62.9%), BOD (64.3%), chromium (99.97%), and sulfide (99.10%); (h) combination of both the beamhouse waste pretreatment effluent and the tanyard waste pretreatment effluent for the end-of-the-pipe treatment by biological process, DAF, and membrane filtration; and (i) development of a new flotation-membrane bioreactor (FMBR) process, including the required biological process, DAF, and membrane filtration for overall cost saving in the final end-of-the-pipe treatment.</description>

                The reduction of atmospheric CO2 requires thought-provoking ideas that would help reduce the concentration level in the atmosphere. In this study, the authors suggest the atomic modification of zeolite materials through controlled electron and ion beam damage to increase their carbon capture capacities. Zeolite samples were synthesized by hydrothermal method and subsequently, two different types of electron beam irradiation were performed on the samples. In the inert gas medium, zeolite samples were irradiated to restrict the structural degradation. In contrast, the vacuum medium which had a raster magnet was the other type which allowed a wide dispersion of the electron beam. The absorbed keratins ranged from 500 kGy to 1000 kGy, and the progression encouraged structural changes in the zeolites to increase the CO&#8322; adsorption uptake. The results have shown that lewis acid zeolite shows increased uptake of CO2 forming an exceptionally high adsorbed volume of 87.86 cm&#179;/g at 500 kGy. The generation of modified zeolites has made it possible to use the innovative Carbfix technique which incorporates the dissolved CO&#178; in water and then pumps it into the basalt layers and harnesses the natural occurrence of minerals to fix the CO2. The methods of modified samples were examined by PXRD, FE-TEM and FE-SEM techniques, TGA and spectrometric methods.</description>

                Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to value-added multicarbon (C2+) productions offers an attractive route for renewable energy storage and CO2 utilization, but it remains challenging to achieve high C2+ selectivity at industrial-level current density. Herein, a Mo1Cu single-atom alloy (SAA) catalyst is reported that displays a remarkable C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 86.4% under 0.80 A cm-2. Furthermore, the C2+ partial current density over Mo1Cu reaches 1.33 A cm-2 with a Faradaic efficiency surpasses 74.3%. The combination of operando spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) indicates the as-prepared Mo1Cu SAA catalyst enables atom-scale cascade catalysis via multi-active site collaboration. The introduced Mo sites promote the H2O dissociation to fabricate active *H, meanwhile, the Cu sites (Cu0) far from Mo atom are active sites for the CO2 activation toward CO. Further, CO and *H are captured by the adjacent Cu sites (Cu&amp;+) near Mo atom, accelerating CO conversion and C&#9472;C coupling process. Our findings benefit the design of tandem electrocatalysts at atomic scale for transforming CO2 to multicarbon products under a high conversion rate.</description>

                Copper-tantalate, Cu2Ta4O11 (CTO), shows significant promise as an efficient photocathode for multi-carbon compounds (C2+) production through photoelectrochemical (PEC) CO2 reduction, owing to its suitable energy bands and catalytic surface. However, synthesizing CTO poses a significant challenge due to its metastable nature and thermal instability. In this study, this challenge is addressed by employing a flux-mediated synthesis technique using a sodium-based flux to create sodium-doped CTO (Na-CTO) thin films, providing enhanced nucleation and stabilization for the CTO phase. To evaluate the PEC performance and catalytic properties of the films, copper(II) oxide (CuO) at the Na-CTO surface is selectively etched. The etched Na-CTO shows a lower dark current, with decreased contribution from photocorrosion, unlike the non-etched Na-CTO which has remaining CuO on the surface. Furthermore, Na-CTO exhibits 7.3-fold ethylene selectivity over hydrogen, thus highlighting its promising potential as a photocathode for C2+ production through PEC CO2 reduction.</description>

                Thermodynamic equipment efficiency continues to be a topical area of research, especially at the advent of 3D printing of compact heat exchangers (HX). The innovative equipment should address wholistic efficiency concerns (thermodynamic, sustainable, economic). This study dynamically simulated a CO2 (R744) transcritical vapor compression refrigeration system fitted with novel hy-brid Triply Periodic Minimal Surface heat exchangers and compared with it to a tubular HX system on energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, economic and environmental performance. The models were run in MATLAB, which called their Simulink dynamic simulations. Key findings were; improved heat transfer effectiveness due to the material&#8217;s intricate shape, exergy efficiency is 5.79% better, initial investment savings is 16.49%, CO2 penalty cost rate reduction of 15.04%, and overall exergy cost rate reduction of 40.83%. The implications of these findings are that the proposed HX achieves more surface area and less material volume for heat transfer equivalent to a bigger pipe HX, hence more economic at less environmental impact and reduced irreversibilities.</description>

      <title>Computational Modeling and Experimental Investigation of CO2-Hydrocarbon System Within Cross-Scale Porous Media</title>

      <description>Feiyu Chen, Linghui Sun, Bowen Li, Xiuxiu Pan, Siyu Jian, Xu Huo, Zhirong Zhang, Chun Feng, Molecules. 30(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406333918

                CO2 flooding plays a crucial role in enhancing oil recovery and achieving carbon reduction targets, particularly in unconventional reservoirs with complex pore structures. The phase behavior of CO2 and hydrocarbons at different scales significantly affects oil recovery efficiency, yet its underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. This study improves existing thermodynamic models by introducing Helmholtz free energy as a convergence criterion and incorporating adsorption effects in micro- and nano-scale pores. This study refines existing thermodynamic models by incorporating Helmholtz free energy as a convergence criterion, offering a more accurate representation of confined phase behavior. Unlike conventional Gibbs free energy-based models, this approach effectively accounts for confinement-induced deviations in phase equilibrium, ensuring improved predictive accuracy for nanoscale reservoirs. Additionally, adsorption effects in micro- and nano-scale pores are explicitly integrated to enhance model reliability. A multi-scale thermodynamic model for CO2-hydrocarbon systems is developed and validated through physical simulations. Key findings indicate that as the scale decreases from bulk to 10 nm, the bubble point pressure shows a deviation of 5% to 23%, while the density of confined fluids increases by approximately 2%. The results also reveal that smaller pores restrict gas expansion, leading to an enhanced CO2 solubility effect and stronger phase mixing behavior. Through phase diagram analysis, density expansion, multi-stage contact, and differential separation simulations, we further clarify how confinement influences CO2 injection efficiency. These findings provide new insights into phase behavior changes in confined porous media, improving the accuracy of CO2 flooding predictions. The proposed model offers a more precise framework for evaluating phase transitions in unconventional reservoirs, aiding in the optimization of CO2-based enhanced oil recovery strategies.</description>

      <title>Influence and Mechanism of Structural Characteristics of Limestone on Quicklime Reaction Activity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/min15010072</link>
      <description>Zehao Yang, Jing Wu, Zhiqin Huang, Yong Zhu, Weikang Liang, Minjie Zhu, Minerals. 15(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406376026

                Quicklime (CaO) is extensively used in metallurgy, chemical engineering, materials science, and greenhouse gas reduction due to its high reactivity, low energy consumption, and environmental benefits. It is considered as one of the most promising raw materials for nanomaterial synthesis and carbon dioxide capture. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the impact of limestone composition and calcination condition. Recent research, however, suggests that the structural characteristics of limestone also play a crucial role in determining the reactivity of quicklime. This study investigates the effect of limestone structure on quicklime reactivity and provides a mechanistic analysis. Three types of limestone with varying structures&#8212;clastic-structured, transitional-crystalline-structured, and crystalline-structured&#8212;were selected for experiments under different calcination times. The results indicate that quicklime produced from clastic-structured limestone exhibits the highest reactivity. The observed differences in quicklime reactivity can primarily be attributed to the following factors: (1) Clastic-structured limestone possesses larger pore volume and specific surface area, which enhance heat conduction and ensure the uniform decomposition of calcite across various regions. (2) The rock-forming calcite particles are fine and small, allowing for the simultaneous decomposition of the outer shell, middle, and core during heating. This prevents &#8220;overburning&#8221; of the shell or &#8220;underfiring&#8221; of the core, thereby improving the overall reactivity. Based on these findings, we propose that fine-grained, high-purity clastic-structured limestone is more favorable for producing high-activity quicklime.</description>

      <title>Meta-Analysis of Larval Bivalve Growth in Response to Ocean Acidification and its Application to Sea Scallop Larval Dispersal in the Mid-Atlantic Bight</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-024-01469-x</link>

                Abstract Ocean acidification, caused by increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide and coastal physical, biological, and chemical processes, is an ongoing threat to carbonate-utilizing organisms living in productive coastal shelves. Bivalves exposed to acidification have shown reduced growth, reproduction, and metabolic processes, with larval stages exhibiting the greatest susceptibility. Here, we compile results from published studies on larval bivalve growth responses to acidification to estimate a relationship between larval growth and seawater aragonite saturation state. We then apply this relationship to a larval dispersal individual-based model for Atlantic sea scallops ( Placopecten magellanicus ), an economically vital species in the Mid-Atlantic Bight that is historically under-studied in acidification research. To date, there have been no published studies on sea scallop larval response to ocean acidification. Model simulations allowed the identification of potential impacts of acidification on scallop success in the region. Results show that larval sea scallops that are sensitive to ocean acidification had a 17% lower settlement success rate and over 50% reduction in larval passage between major Mid Atlantic Bight fisheries habitats than those that are not sensitive to acidification. Additionally, temperature and ocean acidification interact as drivers of larval success, with aragonite saturation states &gt; 3.0 compensating for temperature-induced mortality (&gt; 19 &#730;C) in some cases. This balance between drivers influences larval settlement success across spatial and interannual scales in the Mid Atlantic Bight.</description>

                Bismuth oxide (Bi2O3) emerges as a potent catalyst for converting CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH), leveraging its abundant lattice oxygen and the high activity of its Bi&#8208;O bonds. Yet, its durability is usually impeded by the loss of lattice oxygen causing structure alteration and destabilized active bonds. Herein, we report an innovative approach via the interstitial incorporation of indium (In) into the Bi2O3, significantly enhancing bond stability and preserving lattice oxygen. The optimized In&#8208;Bi2O3&#8208;100 catalyst achieves over 90% Faradaic efficiency for HCOOH production across a wide potential range, in both H&#8208;cells and flow cells, maintaining robust stability after 100 hours of continuous operation. In&#8208;situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the interstitial In doping precisely tunes the adsorption of CO2* and OCHO* intermediate, facilitating rapid conversion. Further in&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy confirms the role of In bolstering the oxidized structure's stability within Bi2O3, critical for sustaining lattice oxygen during electrochemical CO2 reduction.</description>

                This research evaluated the effectiveness of thermally and microwave-assisted alkali-treated HZSM-5 zeolites with varying silica/alumina ratios in catalyzing the direct one-step synthesis of dimethyl ether (DME) from CO2. The reactions were carried out in a dual-bed reactor configuration. A primary catalyst, consisting of Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 (CZA) with a formulation of 10 wt % alumina, 30 wt % Zinc, and 60 wt % Copper, was used to convert CO2 to methanol. Subsequently, zeolite or modified zeolite was utilized as a secondary catalyst for the dehydration of methanol to DME. The catalysts were extensively characterized using various advanced analytical techniques, including transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen physisorption analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR). The CO2 hydrogenation study was carried out at a pressure of 40 bar and a temperature of 250 &#176;C. The results demonstrated that alkali treatment had minimal impact on the crystallinity of the zeolites, but it greatly improved their textural properties. Moreover, the alkali modification enhanced the stability of catalysts and increased their selectivity for DME production.</description>

                We present the synthesis of metal oxide coordination networks based on Preyssler-type polyoxoanions ([NaP5W30O110]14- and [NaP5MoW29O110]14-) bridged with metal-aquo complexes ([M(H2O)n]m+, Mm+ = Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Y3+), induced by electrochemical reduction. Networks bridged with first-row transition metals are isostructural with a previously reported Co-bridged structure, while the Y3+-bridged structure is new. All networks feature an uncommon binding motif of the metal cation to the oxygen atoms at cap positions, which we hypothesize is due to increased electron density at the cap upon reduction. Oxidation of a Zn2+-bridged network resulted in a new structure in which Zn2+-Ocap bonds are lost, indicating the importance of reduction in the connectivity of these polyoxometalate-based coordination networks.</description>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (e-CO2RR) converts value-added chemicals into formate. Bismuth-based resources exhibit promising potential in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate due to their low toxicity and ability to enhance the *OCHO intermediate reaction pathway. However, there are numerous hurdles to optimizing their activity and applicability. Here, we describe the assembly of structurally stable bismuth hydroxide, oxide, and sulfide nanorods supported by a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheet through a simple hydrothermal method. The obtained optimized rGO-Bi2S3 nanorods exhibit improved e-CO2RR conversions to formate in H-cell systems compared to hydroxide and oxide electrocatalysts. The rGO-Bi2S3 nanorods maintain high activity within a wide potential window (&#8722;0.76 to &#8722;1.26 V vs RHE) to obtain overall Faradaic efficiency of formate of &#177;84% at &#8722;1.16 V vs RHE, current density of formate of &#177;41.50 mA cm&#8211;2, and stability for longer than 12 h, with improved Faradaic efficiency greater than &#177;86% in an H-cell system. Theoretical calculations reveal that the strong interaction between rGO and Bi2S3 stabilizes the adsorption of formate in e-CO2RR. The resulting structural transformation of bismuth nanorods based on sulfur, oxide, and hydroxide provides an encouraging avenue for future energy conversion.</description>

                &#8220;Cell factory&#8221; strategy based on microbial anabolism pathways offers an intriguing alternative to relieve the dependence on fossil fuels, which are recognized as the main sources of CO2 emission. Typically, anabolism of intracellular substance in cell factory requires the consumption of sufficient reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). However, it is of great challenge to modify the natural limited anabolism and to increase the insufficient level of NADPH and ATP to optimum concentrations without causing metabolic imbalance. Inspired by the natural photosynthesis process in which NADPH and ATP can both be produced through the coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer processes driven by sunlight, herein we designed a light&#8208;driven bionic system composed of three modules including photo&#8208;induced electron module, electron transfer channel module and proton gradient module. The proposed strategy of light&#8208;driven bionic system enables for achieving simultaneous and controllable supplies of NADPH and ATP, thus facilitating both highly efficient CO2 fixation and biomanufacturing. The proposed light&#8208;driven bionic system design strategy in this work might pave new sustainable ways for reducing power and energy regeneration to optimize microbial metabolism, offering intriguing alternatives for CO2 emission reduction and high value&#8208;added chemical biomanufacturing.</description>

                This study examines the relationship between productive capacity and CO2 emissions in Algeria, addressing the pressing challenge of sustainable development in the context of climate change. The aim is to explore how enhancing production capacity can influence environmental outcomes, particularly in terms of carbon emissions. To achieve this, the study employs an Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model, with results validated through an Error Correction Model (ECM), using data from 1990 to 2023. The findings reveal that improvements in productive capacity contribute to a long-term reduction in CO2 emissions per capita. However, an increase in energy consumption has the potential to undermine these gains, underlining the need for greater energy efficiency. Key policy recommendations suggest prioritizing investments in energy-efficient technologies, thereby enhancing Algeria&#8217;s productive capacity while minimizing environmental impact. This framework provides a valuable pathway for aligning economic growth with sustainable environmental practices, offering actionable insights for policymakers aiming to balance development with climate goals.</description>

                Using an electric motorcycles can contribute to decreasing emissions in the transportation sector. Government policies and various socialization programs have supported the development of electric vehicles. This research was conducted to determine the public perception and implementation of electric motorcycles in Denpasar City. The public perception was obtained through questionnaires and in-depth interviews with related key persons. The statistical analysis of the questionnaire indicated a good category with a score of 3.43. The level of community acceptance was influenced by quieter and environmentally friendly technology, electricity tax subsidies, and lower electric fuel costs. The interview with community and government representatives reinforced the public acceptance finding affected by the intensive public outreach program and a vehicle installment payment scheme. As the result, The implementation target was rated optimistic, with a potential CO2 emission reduction of up to 32,641 tons/year in 2026. All the efforts to implement electric motorcycles in Denpasar City by the goverments have met the requirements to achieve acceptance of perceptions in the people of Denpasar City. This thing&#8217;s very important to reaching out the scenario of reducing CO2 emissions by 2026. In addition, it is important to have a more study regarding to the sustainability of the electric motorcycles ecosystem, such as the availability of data sources update from related agencies that show efforts to improve infrastructure by producers, the number of charging station and selling stations, as well as opportunities for domestic production and incentive policies.

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Ceiling Cooling with PCM in the Hot-Dry Climate of Yazd, Iran: An Experimental Analysis of Energy, Environmental, and Economic Impacts</title>

                The present study investigates experimental cooling from the ceiling using phase change materials (PCMs) in Yazd, a city characterized by a hot and dry climate. A one-fourth scale model of a real room, measuring 4 m &#215; 3 m &#215; 3 m, was employed for the analysis. To evaluate system performance and the impact of PCM on energy consumption reduction, three configurations were considered: a simple PCM system, a PCM system with a fan (PCM-F), and a PCM system with a mini cooler (PCM-C). Additionally, to assess the influence of window configurations on ventilation, temperature, and comfort conditions within the model, three scenarios were examined: two open windows, one open window, and no windows. The economic analysis compared the two systems with the fan and mini cooler against a full mechanical cooling system without PCMs. Furthermore, CO2 emissions and environmental impacts associated with the systems were also evaluated. The results indicate that the presence of PCMs in the ceiling, due to heat absorption during phase change, leads to a temperature reduction of 5 to 10 &#176;C in the ceiling and a 3.2 &#176;C reduction in the average room temperature compared to the scenario without PCMs. The findings demonstrate that ceiling cooling with PCMs significantly contributes to energy consumption reduction during peak hours of cooling demand. Specifically, the PCM-F system results in a 92% reduction, and the PCM-C system leads to a 71% reduction in total cost compared to the reference mechanical cooling system. Additionally, the PCM-F system achieves approximately a 36% reduction, and the PCM-C system results in a 34% reduction in environmental impact relative to the reference full mechanical cooling system.</description>

      <title>Screening of Binder Materials for Ag-Based Gas Diffusion Electrodes for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Conversion to CO</title>

      <description>Prasad Gonugunta, Khatereh Roohi, Mohammad Soleimani, Prasaanth Ravi Anusuyadevi, Peyman Taheri, Mahinder Ramdin, Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406529578

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to chemicals and fuels has made tremendous progress since the introduction of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) to overcome mass-transfer limitations and enable industrial-scale current densities. The advancement in the field, however, has come with new challenges that are related to the stability and degradation of the GDE due to flooding issues, which currently hinder the scale-up. Here, we investigated the effect of six different binding materials (Nafion, polytetrafluoroethylene, Fumion, Pention, poly(vinyl alcohol), and polypyrrole) on the stability and performance of Ag-based GDEs for CO2R to CO in alkaline media. All binders show a decrease in the Faraday efficiency (FE) of CO and increase in hydrogen evolution reaction over time. The most hydrophilic GDE based on polypyrrole can uphold a higher FE of CO for longer times, which is contrary to a common belief that low wettability is required for long-term stability. By using a range of tools (SEM&#8211;EDX, SEM&#8211;FIB, X-ray diffraction, and contact angle measurements) for the postelectrolysis characterization of the GDEs, we show that the performance loss is related to flooding, bi(carbonate) precipitation, and catalyst agglomeration. These results contribute to a better understanding of the stability issues in GDE-based CO2 electrolyzers.</description>

      <title>Seismic and ultrasonic frequency measurements on partially saturated rocks under X-ray</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/gji/ggaf017</link>
      <description>K. S. Mews, Serhii Lozovyi, Geophysical Journal International. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406358697

                Summary Low-frequency laboratory measurements provide direct access to the elastic properties of samples within the seismic frequency band, offering calibration data for seismic survey analysis. Additionally, &#194;&#181;CT imaging can quantify actual saturations and provides insights into phase distributions at the pore scale. To conduct laboratory triaxial measurements at seismic frequencies while simultaneously imaging the rock interior, we developed an X-ray transparent low-frequency apparatus. Our apparatus determines rock mechanical properties at seismic frequencies (0.5&#226;&amp;#x80;&amp;#x93;150 Hz) and strain amplitudes (10&#8722;7&#226;&amp;#x80;&amp;#x93;10&#8722;5), measuring Young&#226;&amp;#x80;&amp;#x99;s modulus, Poisson&#226;&amp;#x80;&amp;#x99;s ratio, and attenuation. In addition P- and S-wave velocities at ultrasonic frequencies are measured. We conducted imbibition-drainage experiments to assess the effect of saturation and patch size on seismic and ultrasonic elastic properties in sandstone. Additional tests with liquid and gaseous CO2 reveal the impact of partial CO2-gas saturation. The imbibition-drainage experiment demonstrated that P-wave velocity at ultrasonic frequencies was elevated during drainage and reduced during imbibition. Drainage caused patchy saturation, while imbibition resulted in uniform saturation. This implies that ultrasonic measurements, with wavelengths comparable to the pore fluid patch size, are likely influenced by scattering. In contrast, low-frequency measurements, where the wavelength surpasses the patch size, capture effective medium properties and therefore are not affected by scattering effects. The results of the CO2 test suggest that low-frequency measurements can detect even low gas saturations (4% gaseous CO2). In contrast, ultrasonic velocity measurements primarily reflect the response of the fully saturated sample at low gas saturations and do not indicate a reduction in velocity. Identifying fluid-solid interactions and estimating saturation via &#194;&#181;CT imaging is crucial, especially with minimal gas presence. Our combined approach allows precise determination of elastic properties at seismic frequencies and shows the importance of low-frequency over ultrasonic measurements.</description>

      <title>The role of labour and nature within just transition strategies</title>

                The term through which to speak about trade union's environmental policies these days is Just Transition. As with any term that enters the public discourse, the more it is used, the less it means. We will first outline the major turning points of the history of the idea of just transition (avant la lettre) in trade unions across the globe. In a second part we discuss some of the environmental policies of trade unions in the global north and south which go beyond ideas of a "technological fix" and the reduction of CO2 emissions only including problems of water, soil and biodiversity. The third part provides a critical assessment of these policies arguing that given the limits of natural resources, policies need to provide an alternative to green growth and include shop floor in the development of just transition strategies.</description>

                Abstract. Developing effective global strategies for climate mitigation requires an independent assessment of green-house gas emission inventory at the urban scale. In the framework of the Dutch Ruisdael Observatory infrastructure project, we have enhanced the Dutch Large-Eddy Simulation (DALES) model to simulate carbon dioxide (CO2) plume emission and three-dimensional dispersion within the turbulent boundary layer. The unique ability to explicitly resolve turbulent structures at the hectometer resolution (100 m) makes DALES particularly suitable for detailed realistic simulations of both singular high-emitting point sources and urban emissions, aligning with the goals of Ruisdael Observatory. The model setup involves a high-resolution simulation (100 m &#215; 100 m) covering the main urban area of the Netherlands (51.5&#176;&#8211;52.5&#176; N, 3.75&#176;&#8211;6.45&#176; E). The model integrates meteorological forcing from the HARMONIE-AROME weather forecasting model, background CO2 levels from the CAMS reanalysis, as well as point source emissions and downscaled area emissions derived from 1 km &#215; 1 km emission inventory from the national registry. The latter are prepared using a sector-specific downscaling workflow, covering major emission categories. Biogenic CO2 exchanges from grasslands and forests are interactively included in the hectometer calculations within the heterogeneous land-surface model of DALES. Our evaluation strategy is twofold, comparing DALES simulations with: (i) the state-of-the art LOTOS-EUROS model simulations and (ii) in-situ Cabauw tower measurements and Ruisdael surface observations of the urban background in the Rotterdam area at Westmaas and Slufter. Our comprehensive statistical analysis confirmed the effectiveness of DALES in modeling the urban-scale CO2 emission distribution and plume dispersion under turbulent conditions, but also revealed potential limitations and areas for further improvement. Thus, our new model framework provides valuable insights into emission transport and dispersion of CO2, in support of emission uncertainty reduction using atmospheric measurements and the development of effective climate policies.</description>

      <title>From forests to farming: identification of photosynthetic limitations in breadfruit across diverse environments</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpaf007</link>
      <description>Graham J. Dow, Noa Kekuewa Lincoln, Dolly Autufuga, Robert E. Paull, Tree Physiology. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406440054

                Abstract Breadfruit (Artocarpus altilis) is a prolific tropical tree producing highly nutritious and voluminous carbohydrate-rich fruits. Already recognized as an underutilized crop, breadfruit could ameliorate food insecurity and protect against climate-related productivity shocks in undernourished equatorial regions. However, a lack of fundamental knowledge impedes widespread agricultural adoption, from modern agroforestry to plantation schemes. Here, we used a multi-environment breadfruit variety trial across the Hawaiian Islands to determine photosynthetic limitations, understand the role of site conditions or varietal features, and define their contributions to agronomic efficiency. Photosynthetic rates were dependent on location and variety, and strongly correlated with fruit yield (r2 = 0.80, P &amp;lt; 0.001). Photochemistry was suitable to full-sunlight conditions, with a saturation point of 1545 PAR, Vcmax of 151 &#956;mol m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, and Jmax of 128 &#956;mol m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, which are high-end compared to other tropical and temperate tree crops. However, limitations on CO2 assimilation were imposed by stomatal characteristics, including stomatal density (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and diurnal oscillations of stomatal conductance (&amp;gt;50% reductions from daily maxima). These constraints on CO2 diffusion are likely to limit maximum productivity more than photochemistry. Our results comprise the first comprehensive analysis of breadfruit photosynthesis, successfully links ecophysiology with fruit yield, and identifies vital traits for future research and management optimization.</description>

                The economic feasibility of low-carbon ammonia production pathways, such as steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage, biomass gasification, and electrolysis, is assessed under various policy frameworks, including subsidies, carbon pricing, and renewable hydrogen regulations. Here, we show that employing a stochastic techno-economic analysis at the plant level and a net present value approach under the US Inflation Reduction Act reveals that carbon capture and biomass pathways demonstrate strong economic potential due to cost-effectiveness and minimal public support needs. Conversely, the electrolytic pathway faces significant economic challenges due to higher costs and lower efficiency. We conclude that efficient decarbonization of ammonia production requires adapting the Haber-Bosch process for variable bioenergy quality, ensuring safe CO2 transport and storage, advancing research to lower costs and improve efficiency in renewable energy and storage technologies, as well as creating a technologically neutral policy framework.</description>

                The sand from the processing of iron ore has been widely used in civil construction in Brazil, especially in the states of Minas Gerais, Esp&#237;rito Santo and S&#227;o Paulo. It is used as fine aggregate in the production of mortars, cement products and concrete. With the possibility of producing new sand in several iron ore mines in the state of Minas Gerais, the present study aimed to develop and analyze concrete dosages with various ore sands and sands present in the industrial market in the Belo Horizonte region. The replacement of natural river sand with mining sand in concrete dosages was evaluated and the Abrams curves were analyzed for the various dosages developed. It was possible to observe a performance gain in the dosages carried out with ore sands, with a reduction of up to 7% in cement consumption in the mixes. Thus, it can be concluded that the use of mining sand in the production of concrete is efficient, with technical and productive gains, promoting sustainable construction, reducing CO2 and promoting the circular economy in the construction chain.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of bluff body geometry effects on nitrogen oxides emissions from Cambridge stratified burner</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-86198-2</link>
      <description>Mahmood Nahvi, Kiumars Mazaheri, Mohammad Zabetian Targhi, Fatemeh Eskandari, Scientific Reports. 15(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406475665

                In this study, a series of experiments are done to analyze the effect of bluff body geometry on the NOx reduction of a natural gas-air stratified swirl burner. The stratified burner of Cambridge University is chosen to study the mentioned geometrical effect, and the geometry modification of bluff body is used as a simple method for NOx reduction, which can be easily applied to the systems using these burners, including gas turbines. The bluff body geometrical change to an annular bluff body is inspired by the fact that the areas in which the edge of the bluff body is in contact with the unburned flow have lower temperatures, which can drastically affect combustion parameters, especially emissions. This new geometry is called the Annular Bluff body Stratified Burner, ABSB. The comparison of the mentioned burners is made for three equivalence ratios, &#1060;, stratification cases: premixed, moderately stratified, and highly stratified with a global equivalence ratio of 0.75, in the conditions of atmospheric pressure and the temperature of the inlet mixture of 26 degrees of Celsius. Flame spectroscopy compares the chemiluminescence intensities of OH*, CH*, C2*, H2O*, and CO2*. Digital image processing, flame edge detection, and exhaust gas analysis are also utilized to measure flames' general dimensions and emissions. According to experiments, for ABSB cases, a general decrease of about 14% in Nitrogen Oxides, especially NO and NO2, and an increase of about 17% in Carbon Monoxide are observed. Besides, the average bluff body temperature dropped by about 20% in ABSB for all three stratification cases.</description>

                This study was aimed at assessing the effectiveness of design solutions for the development of Kyiv&#8217;s transport infrastructure based on transport modelling and analysis of possible socio-economic effects. To do this, a four-step algorithm for modelling transport demand was used, based on data from sociological surveys, territory plans, and forecasts for 2030. The results of the study showed significant changes in the functioning of the Kyiv transport network as a result of the implementation of the proposed design solutions. The transport modelling helped to estimate quantitative indicators such as traffic volumes on major highways, as well as qualitative changes such as reduced congestion, shorter travel times, and cost savings. One of the key results was that the opening of new exits and entrances to the Darnytskyi Bridge on the left bank contributed to a slight increase in bridge capacity, but the biggest effect was seen on the approaches to the bridge. The additional approaches have increased traffic volumes, which indicates improved transport accessibility for drivers using this transport hub. The results related to environmental performance were also important. The reduction in congestion resulted in a reduction in CO2 emissions, which is a significant contribution to improving the environmental situation in the city. In terms of cost-effectiveness, the results demonstrated significant savings in transport losses, confirming that the implementation of the proposed measures has a positive impact on transport infrastructure, as well as reducing financial losses associated with travel. Thus, the results of the study confirmed that the proposed design solutions have a positive impact on the development of the transport network, increasing capacity and reducing negative environmental impact, which opens up opportunities for creating a more efficient transport system that meets the requirements of sustainable development and improves the overall quality of life of Kyiv residents</description>

      <title>Soil smoldering in temperate forests: a neglected contributor to fire carbon emissions revealed by atmospheric mixing ratios</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-22-213-2025</link>
      <description>Lilian Vallet, Charbel Abdallah, Thomas Lauvaux, Lilian Joly, Michel Ramonet, Philippe Ciais, Morgan Lopez, Ir&#232;ne Xu&#233;ref-R&#233;my, Florent Mouillot, Biogeosciences. 22(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406337752

                Abstract. Fire is regarded as an essential climate variable, emitting greenhouse gases in the combustion process. Current global assessments of fire emissions traditionally rely on coarse remotely sensed burned-area data, along with biome-specific combustion completeness and emission factors (EFs). However, large uncertainties persist regarding burned areas, biomass affected, and emission factors. Recent increases in resolution have improved previous estimates of burned areas and aboveground biomass while increasing the information content used to derive emission factors, complemented by airborne sensors deployed in the tropics. To date, temperate forests, characterized by a lower fire incidence and stricter aerial surveillance restrictions near wildfires, have received less attention. In this study, we leveraged the distinctive fire season of 2022, which impacted western European temperate forests, to investigate fire emissions monitored by the atmospheric tower network. We examined the role of soil smoldering combustion responsible for higher carbon emissions, locally reported by firefighters but not accounted for in temperate fire emission budgets. We assessed the CO/CO2 ratio released by major fires in the Mediterranean, Atlantic pine, and Atlantic temperate forests of France. Our findings revealed low modified combustion efficiency (MCE) for the two Atlantic temperate regions, supporting the assumption of heavy smoldering combustion. This type of combustion was associated with specific fire characteristics, such as long-lasting thermal fire signals, and affected ecosystems encompassing needle leaf species, peatlands, and superficial lignite deposits in the soils. Thanks to high-resolution data (approximately 10 m) on burned areas, tree biomass, peatlands, and soil organic matter (SOM), we proposed a revised combustion emission framework consistent with the observed MCEs. Our estimates revealed that 6.15 Mt CO2 (&#177;2.65) was emitted, with belowground stock accounting for 51.75 % (&#177;16.05). Additionally, we calculated a total emission of 1.14 Mt CO (&#177;0.61), with 84.85 % (&#177;3.75) originating from belowground combustion. As a result, the carbon emissions from the 2022 fires in France amounted to 7.95 MtCO2-eq (&#177;3.62). These values exceed by 2-fold the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) estimates for the country, reaching 4.18 MtCO2-eq (CO and CO2). Fires represent 1.97 % (&#177;0.89) of the country's annual carbon footprint, corresponding to a reduction of 30 % in the forest carbon sink this year. Consequently, we conclude that current European fire emission estimates should be revised to account for soil combustion in temperate forests. We also recommend the use of atmospheric mixing ratios as an effective monitoring system of prolonged soil fires that have the potential to re-ignite in the following weeks.</description>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction to ethanol faces challenges such as low selectivity, a product mixture with liquid electrolyte, and poor catalyst/reactor stability. Here, we developed a grain-rich zinc-doped Cu2O precatalyst that presented a high ethanol Faradaic efficiency of over 40% under a current density of 350 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2. Our density functional theory (DFT) simulation suggested that Zn atoms inside the structure have a greater carbophilicity than the Cu atoms to help facilitate *CHCHO formation, a key reaction intermediate toward ethanol instead of other C2 products. A high Faradaic efficiency ratio between ethanol and ethylene (FEEtOH/FEC2H4) reached 2.34 in the zinc-doped Cu2O precatalyst, representing an over 4-fold improvement compared to bare Cu2O precatalyst. By integrating this Cu-based catalyst into a porous solid electrolyte (PSE) reactor with a salt-managing design, we achieved stable ethanol production for over 180 h under a current density of 250 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 while maintaining ethanol selectivity at &#8764;30%.</description>

                The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the reduction percentage in the yearly concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and CO before and after COVID-19 in Amman, the capital city of Jordan, which has the highest population and traffic densities, and Zarqa, an industrial area with 55% of different types of industries. Additionally, this study examines the effect of metrological parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed on air pollutant dispersion, particularly particulate matter 10 (PM10), which is considered uncontrollable. Furthermore, this study highlights the critical environmental and health effects of air pollution. The Ministry of Environment measured the yearly concentration of air pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, and PM10) in three areas (Amman, Zarqa, and Irbid) in 12 stations in nearby industrial, urban, and traffic areas using the nitric oxide (NO) NO2 chemiluminescence analyzer Model 42i, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and SO2 analyzer model 450iQ, and PM10 Peta Attenuation analyzer. The few air pollution studies in Jordan have primarily focused on average yearly concentrations of SO2, NO2, CO, and PM10 without considering the monthly or daily variations that greatly concern health and the environment. The results of the present study reveal that during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant decrease in the annual concentrations of H2S, SO2, and NO2 as the reduction percentage in Amman 70, 58, 87% respectively, and in Zarqa 36, 62, 72% respectively. However, there is a slight reduction in CO and PM10 with 39 and 18% at Amman and 19% and 40% at Zarqa. This decrease is attributed to the reduction of primary sources of air pollutants, which are linked to the reductions in traffic volume and industrial activities during the lockdown. Furthermore, the results show that the Jordanian government has implemented regulations to address air pollution in residential areas. These regulations aim to prevent the burning of trees and smoking. The government is also adopting new transportation technologies to reduce the impact of CO2 and other pollutants produced by diesel and gasoline vehicles. The use of green fuels like synthetic natural gas, green methanol, or ammonia, as well as the increasing use of electric cars, are being encouraged. Implementing the bus rapid transit system, which started in 2021 and includes linked lines in the east and west areas of Jordan, has reduced the number of cars used and solved the main issues in crowded regions. Overall, the country has taken significant steps to address and control air pollution.</description>

      <title>Potential for reducing urban emissions with Semarang City pedestrian paths</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202560503016</link>

                Semarang City, as one of the big cities in Indonesia, faces significant challenges related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, most of which come from the transportation sector. These emissions contribute to climate change and the decline in air quality in the city. This study explores the potential for reducing GHG emissions through the development of pedestrian paths in Semarang. By analyzing transportation emission data and the coverage of existing pedestrian paths, this study assesses the effectiveness of pedestrian path development in reducing emissions and improving urban quality of life. The methodology used includes GHG emission analysis, assessment of the area and coverage of pedestrian paths, and emission reduction projection models based on user survey data. Currently, only around 20% of the total roads in Semarang City have been built for pedestrian paths. By expanding and improving the quality of pedestrian paths, the potential for reducing CO2 emissions can reach 11% of total transportation emissions. This study suggests further development of pedestrian paths by considering factors such as comfort, accessibility, and connectivity to public transportation. This development not only has the potential to reduce GHG emissions but also increasing the resilience of cities to global climate change.</description>

                In this essay the reader will find more details and descriptions of the following: The aviation industry's reliance on fossil fuels leads to emissions of CO2 and other pollutants, contributing to climate change and poor air quality. Budapest Airport serves as a focal point for air and noise pollution due to emissions from aircraft engines, ground vehicles, and infrastructure. Noise pollution from aircraft operations affects nearby residents, leading to long term health effects and disturbances during day and night. Recommendations for solving the problem include collaborating with airlines to reduce emissions by promoting cleaner aircraft models and operational practices, investing in electric or hybrid vehicles for airport operations and ground support equipment, implementing infrastructure for electric vehicle charging and exploring renewable energy sources. For Noise Mitigation Measures, promote quieter engine technology and incentivize the use of quieter aircraft models. Optimize flight paths to minimize noise exposure for communities. Adopt noise reduction practices during take-off and landing, such as reduced engine thrust and continuous descent approaches. For Community Engagement and Support, expand support for community initiatives like window insulation programs to mitigate noise impacts on residents. Collaborate with local authorities to improve air quality through joint initiatives like tree planting and pollution control measures. Implement transparent reporting mechanisms to keep the public informed about air quality and noise pollution levels.</description>

      <title>Standardization of the Miniculture Technique for isolation of Leishmania spp. v1</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.n92ldry5og5b/v1</link>

                Culture media are employed for the isolation of numerous biological agents causing diseases in humans and animals. The traditional culture method (TCM) is regarded as the gold standard in the diagnosis of Visceral and Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (VL / TL), as it is known that Leishmania spp. have a good growth on culture media used in TCM. The microculture and miniculture method consists in the use of tubes with a smaller volume, promoting a microaerophilic environment with high CO2 levels, which enhances the amastigote-to-promastigote differentiation. One of the disadvantages of culture methods is the possibility of contamination by bacteria and fungi, originating from the biological samples or the environment. It is important to ensure sterility during sample collection and processing. Therefore, the sample handling must be carried out with sterile material in a biological safety cabinet. This methodology requires trained personnel as well as sites adapted to biosafety standards for handling microorganisms class II. Although the microculture method is more sensitive than miniculture, the tubes used in this technique do not allow the parasite isolation and expansion. The miniculture tubes, like the traditional method, allows access to the isolate for post-culture analyses such as species characterization. Additionally, the miniculture showed better sensitivity compared to traditional methods and a shorter time to achieve positivity. Furthermore, miniculture is easy to implement, using the same equipment and materials as traditional culture but in smaller volumes, which can lead to cost reduction.</description>

      <title>&#8220;Caking&#8221; Process in Green Cement Composites under the Impact of Environment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.23947/2949-1835-2024-3-4-74-81</link>

                Introduction. The problems of resource and energy saving during production of cements and concretes on their basis are of great importance in the world. An important trend in solving these problems is the development of green cements, which contain various mineral additives of natural and anthropogenic origin. The advantages of the green cements compared to the clinker-based cements are revealed from both the environmental point of view &#8212; reduction of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, use of the industrial by-products, and the technical point of view &#8212; improvement of the technological properties of concrete mixes, improvement of the physical, mechanical and operational properties of con[1]cretes. At the same time, replacement of the clinker component in Portland cement by the mineral components leads to the change of the physical and mechanical properties of cement, including that taking place during the &#8220;caking&#8221; process in conditions of interaction with the environment. The research presented in the paper aims at studying the effect of long-term storage of plain cements and green cement composites in conditions of free interaction with the environment on the physical and mechanical properties of the cement stone. Materials and Methods. Various types of cements were used in the experiments. Green cement composites were obtained in the laboratory by intergrinding with the slag and fly-ash respectively. To improve the grinding process and inhibit the sorption process, a grinding intensifying agent was added into the composition of green cement composites. The impact of the environment on the cement sorption process was assessed by measuring indirect parameters: specific surface area, angle of natural repose, bulk density and cement stone compressive strength. Results. The obtained results indicate that the specific surface area of cement samples stored in the open air for 30 days reduces significantly due to the &#8220;caking&#8221; process, on average by 25% in type I cements, whereas in green cement composites this process is less intense and amounts to 15%. A similar consistent pattern is observed when measuring the angle of repose and bulk density. The decrease in the angle of repose and high values of bulk density for type I cement are related to the active sorption of moisture from the environment, which leads to the formation of hydrate &#8220;bridges&#8221; upon interaction of particles. Compared to the control samples, the compressive strength in the cement stone samples tested at the age of 28 days of curing decreases on average by 25&#8211;30% in type I cements and by a less extent of 15&#8211;20% in green cement composites. Discussion and Conclusion. When storing different types of cement in conditions of free interaction with the environment, moisture is sorbed and the hydrate &#8220;bridges&#8221; are formed on the surface of the particles. This process goes more intensely in type I cement due to the highly active surfaces of its particles, which hydrate faster, resulting in a decrease of cement activity by 30%. At the same time, the green cement composites lose their activity less significantly &#8211; by 20%. This consistent pattern can be explained by the less active surfaces of the particles of mineral additives included into the composition, as well as by addition of a grinding intensifying agent into a composition.</description>

                A family of Co-based perovskites BaCo1&#8211;xFexO3 exhibits exceptional electrochemical activity as cathode materials for low-temperature solid-oxide fuel cells. Due to the size mismatch between Ba in the A-site and Co/Fe in the B-site, BaCo1&#8211;xFexO3 usually experiences phase transition from cubic symmetry at high temperatures to hexagonal structure at low temperatures and surface Ba-cation segregation. The phase transition would deteriorate bulk diffusivity and cause structural reliability issues, while the surface cation segregation could worsen surface-exchange property and long-term stability. Herein, A-site cation deficiency in combination with a B-site doping strategy is employed to tune the crystal structure and associated defects of Ba1&#8211;xCo0.6Fe0.2Zr0.1Y0.1O3&#8722;&#948;, achieving both excellent oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability. The materials are synthesized and systematically characterized. Compared to BaCo0.6Fe0.2Zr0.1Y0.1O3&#8722;&#948;, the A-site deficient perovskite Ba0.95Co0.6Fe0.2Zr0.1Y0.1O3&#8722;&#948; obtains better electrochemical kinetics properties and stability as well as tolerance to CO2. The fundamental mechanisms associated with these properties are discussed from the perspective of crystal structure, defects, charge-carrier transport route, average bonding energy, and surface cation segregation.</description>

                The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) for ammonia production is a promising method for mitigating CO2 emissions. In this study, we investigate the NRR in alkaline media using both labeled and unlabeled compounds on MoS2 electrodes, employing online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OLEMS) and UV-vis spectroscopy to identify gaseous and solution-phase products, respectively. Notably, OLEMS results reveal the detection of N2H+ and N2H2+ species as intermediates of the NRR, following the observation of N2 consumption at &#8722;0.4 V vs. RHE and the onset of NH3 production around &#8722;0.5 V vs. RHE. However, N2H3+ and N2H4+ species were not observed. UV-vis spectroscopy confirmed the production of NH3. The N2 molecule first adsorbs onto the catalyst surface, leading to two consecutive protonation steps and the formation of N2H and N2H2 intermediates at potentials below &#8722;0.4 V. N2H2 is identified as the predominant intermediate in ammonia production. For the first time, this study, utilizing isotope labeling and OLEMS, has enabled the identification of key NRR intermediates, the correlation of NH3 production with N2 consumption as a function of applied potential, and has provided crucial insights into this important reaction. A comprehensive understanding of the NRR mechanism will facilitate the development of high-performance catalysts.</description>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds enormous potential as a carbon-neutral route to the sustainable production of fuels and platform chemicals. The durability for long-term operation is currently inadequate for commercialization, however, and the underlying deactivation process remains elusive. A fundamental understanding of the degradation mechanism of electrocatalysts, which can dictate the overall device performance, is needed. In this work, we report the structural dynamics and degradation pathway of Cu oxide nanoparticles (CuOx NPs) during the CO2RR by using in situ small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The in situ SAXS reveals a reduction in the size of NPs when subjected to a potential at which no reaction products are detected. At potentials where the CO2RR starts to occur, CuOx NPs are agglomerated through a particle migration and coalescence process in the early stage of the reaction, followed by Ostwald ripening (OR) as the dominant degradation mechanism for the remainder of the reaction. As the applied potential becomes more negative, the OR process becomes more dominant, and for the most negative applied potential, OR dominates for the entire reaction time. The morphological changes are linked to a gradual decrease in the formation rate for multicarbon products (C2H4 and ethanol). Other reaction parameters, including reaction intermediates and local high pH, induce changes in the agglomeration process and final morphology of the CuOx NPs electrode, supported by post-mortem ex situ microscopic analysis. The in situ XAS analysis suggests that the CuOx NPs reduced into the metallic state before the structural transformation was observed. The introduction of high surface area carbon supports with ionomer coating mitigates the degree of structural transformation and detachment of the CuOx NPs electrode. These findings show the dynamic nature of Cu nanocatalysts during the CO2RR and can serve as a rational guideline toward a stable catalyst system under electrochemical conditions.</description>

                Greenhouse gas emissions are primary drivers of climate change, and the intensification of extreme heat and urban heat island effects poses serious threats to urban ecosystems, public health, and energy consumption. This study systematically evaluated the carbon reduction potential of 369 urban parks in Jinan during extreme heat events using land surface temperature (LST) retrieval, combined with CatBoost + SHAP machine learning methods. Results indicate that the LST in Jinan ranged from 1.77 &#176;C to 59.44 &#176;C, and 278 parks exhibited significant cooling effects, collectively saving 2943 tons of CO2 per day&#8212;offsetting 11.28% of the city&#8217;s fossil fuel emissions. Small parks, such as community parks, demonstrated higher carbon-saving efficiency (CSE), while large ecological parks showed greater carbon-saving intensity (CSI). CSE was strongly correlated with vegetation coverage and surrounding population density, with efficiency increasing when the vegetation index was within 0.3&#8211;0.7 and population density ranged 0&#8211;5000 or 15,000&#8211;22,500 people. CSI was influenced by evapotranspiration and park geometric form, increasing significantly when the park area exceeded 250 hectares or evapotranspiration ranged 2.5&#8211;6.0. However, elevation and albedo negatively impacted both metrics, with the lowest CSI observed when elevation exceeded 150 m or albedo surpassed 18%.</description>

      <title>Phytotoxic Effects of Polystyrene Microplastics on Growth Morphology, Photosynthesis, Gaseous Exchange and Oxidative Stress of Wheat Vary with Concentration and Shape</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics13010057</link>
      <description>Komal Riaz, Tahira Yasmeen, Kotb A. Attia, Itoh Kimiko, Muhammad Arif, Toxics. 13(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406382893

                Microplastics pose a serious ecological threat to agricultural soils, as they are very persistent in nature. Microplastics can enter the soil system in different ways and present different shapes and concentrations. However, little is known about how plants react to microplastics with different concentrations and shapes. To this end, we conducted a factorial pot experiment with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in which we mixed polystyrene (PS) in different shapes (bead, fiber and powder) with soil at concentrations of 0, 1, 3 and 5%. Although all shapes of PS significantly reduced morphological growth traits, PS in powder shape was the microplastic that reduced plant height (by 58&#8211;60%), fresh biomass (by 54&#8211;55%) and dry biomass (by 61&#8211;62%) the most, especially at the 3% and 5% concentrations compared with 0% PS. Similar negative effects were also observed for root length and fresh root weight at the 3% and 5% concentrations, regardless of shape. A concentration-dependent reduction in the leaf area index (LAI) was also observed. Interestingly, increasing the PS concentration tended to up-regulate the activity of antioxidant enzymes for all shapes, indicating potential complexity and a highly time-dependent response related to various reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, PS at the 5% concentration caused a significant reduction in chlorophyll pigmentation and photosynthetic rate. For the transpiration rate, stomatal conductance and intercellular CO2 concentration, the negative effects of PS on wheat plants increased with the increase in microplastic concentration for all shapes of PS. Overall, we concluded that PS microplastics at higher concentrations are potentially more devastating to the physiological growth and biochemical attributes of wheat, as evidenced by the negative effects on photosynthetic pigments and gas exchange parameters for all shapes. We recommend further research experiments not only on translocation but also on tissue-specific retention of different sizes in crops to fully understand their impact on food safety.</description>

                In this work, we have explored 2D semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), black phosphorus (BP), and graphene for various applications using liquid and mechanical exfoliation routes. The topical areas of interest that motivate our work include considering factors such as device integration, stability, doping, and the effect of gasses to modulate the electronic transport characteristics of the underlying 2D materials. In the first area, we have integrated solution-processed transparent conducting oxides (TCOs), specifically indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) with BP, which is a commonly used TCO for solar cell devices. Here we have found surface treatment of glass substrates with a plasma before spin-coating the solution-processed ITO, to be effective in improving coverage and uniformity of the ITO film by promoting wettability and film adhesion. The maximum transmittance obtained was measured to be ~75% in the visible region, while electrical measurements made on BP/ITO heterostructures showed improved transport characteristics compared to the bare ITO film. Within the integration realm, inkjet-printing of BP and MoS2 p-n hetero-junctions on standard ITO glass substrates in a vertical architecture was also demonstrated. To address the issue of stability which some 2D materials such as BP face, we experimented with ionic liquids (ILs) to passivation the hydrophilic surface of BP to minimize its oxidative degradation. The enhanced stability of BP was inferred through Raman spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy techniques, where no observable changes in the A1g and A2g Raman vibrational modes were observed for the BP films passivated with ILs over time under ambient conditions. On the other hand, a blue-shift in these Raman modes was evident for unpassivated samples. Atomic force microscopy measurements on the unpassivated samples clearly revealed the difference in surface characteristics through localized regions of degradation that intensified with time which was absent in IL passivated BP samples. The electronic device measurements for IL coated BP devices showed a more stabilized Ids&#8722;Vds characteristic in the 5.4 K to 335 K temperature range. Prototypical demonstrations of stabilized ILs/BP devices at ambient printed on flexible polyimide substrates were also successfully made. At the same time, doping is one of the essential steps required for the modulation of carrier density and electronic transport in electronic and optoelectronic devices, which is the third topical area we have addressed in this work with semiconducting TMDs. Of the conventional approaches used to dope 3D semiconductors, ion-implantation is commonly adopted but given the ultra-thin nature of 2D materials, this approach is not feasible as it causes severe damage to the delicate crystalline lattice of ultra-thin 2D membranes. Instead, we have used plasma-based doping routes with UV-ozone treatement and solution processing using 1,2 dichloroethane, to characterize the temperature-dependent two-terminal and three-terminal electronic and optoelectronic transport of mechanically exfoliated 2D MoS2 and WSe2. A significant difference was seen in the optoelectronic properties between the two dopants, owing to differences in their respective doping mechanisms and the intrinsic structural attributes of the exfoliated flakes. A significant reduction in barrier height was evident after doping using both techniques in MoS2, while an increase in barrier height after soaking in 1,2 dichloroethane was seen in WSe2. Lastly, in the fourth topical area for sensing devices, we have studied the effect of gas-flow in inkjet-printed and spin-coated graphene and MoS2 to modulate the electronic transport for the 2D materials since their increased surface area is an ideal platform to observe interactions with external stimuli, in this case, in-coming gas species. Here, the chamber pressure and change in current with flow of gas was measured in the steady-state, as well as time-dependent dynamic transport toward nitrogen and carbon dioxide. We observed significant differences in the electrical response of mono-elemental graphene and binary MoS2, owing to differences in microstructure and joule heating response to the ambient gas. In conclusion, the findings obtained from our work will provide an important framework to help guide strategies in further improving integration schemes, stability, doping and sensing behavior driven by the unique structural attributes inherent to 2D materials for high-performance devices in the future.</description>

                Accurately forecasting the energy consumption of industrial equipment and linking these forecasts to equipment health has become essential in modern manufacturing. This capability is crucial for advancing predictive maintenance strategies to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we propose a hybrid model that combines Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for energy consumption prediction with a statistical change-point detection algorithm to identify significant shifts in consumption patterns. These shifts are then correlated with the equipment&#8217;s health status, providing a comprehensive overview of energy usage and potential failure points. In our case study, we began by evaluating the prediction model to confirm the performance of LSTM, comparing it with several machine learning models commonly used in the literature, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and GRU. After assessing different loss functions, the LSTM model achieved the strongest prediction accuracy, with an RMSE of 0.07, an MAE of 0.0188, and an R 2 of 92.7%. The second part of the model, which focuses on detecting change points in consumption patterns, was evaluated by testing several cost functions combined with binary segmentation and dynamic programming. Applied to a real-world case, it successfully detected a change point two months before equipment failure, offering the potential to reduce energy consumption by 27,052 kWh. This framework not only clarifies the relationship between equipment health and CO2 emissions but also provides actionable insights into emission reduction, contributing to both economic and environmental sustainability.</description>

      <title>Assessing biochar's impact on greenhouse gas emissions, microbial biomass, and enzyme activities in agricultural soils through meta-analysis and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2025.178541</link>
      <description>Jinze Bai, Bruno Rafael de Almeida Moreira, Yuxin Bai, Cresha Gracy Nadar, Yongzhong Feng, Sudhir Yadav, The Science of The Total Environment. 963(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406517528

                The role of biochar in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improving soil health is a topic of extensive research, yet its effects remain debated. Conflicting evidence exists regarding biochar's impact on soil microbial-mediated emissions with respect to different GHGs. This study systematically examines these divergent perspectives, aiming to investigate biochar's influence on GHG emissions and soil health in agricultural soils. The meta-analysis includes 2594 paired observations from 157 studies conducted between 2000 and 2024. It was found that biochar increased the presence of amoA and nosZ genes by 39.4 % and 41.7 %, respectively, while reducing the abundance of the nirS gene by 17.8 %. This led to a 13.1 % decrease in N2O emissions. Nitrous emissions were positively associated with mean annual temperature and biochar's pyrolysis temperature and dosage while inversely related to soil pH, nitrogen fertilisation rate, and biochar pH and carbon content. Biochar also regulated enzyme activity related to the nutrient cycle and increased microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus by 16.6 %, 23.9 %, and 50.2 %, respectively, leading to changes in microbial community diversity. These changes contributed to a reduction in CO2 and CH4 emissions, particularly when biochar and nitrogen fertiliser were applied at doses below 21.4 t ha-1 and 242.5 kg ha-1, as predicted by machine learning models. This study offers an overview of the positive impact of biochar amendments on soil GHG emissions mitigation. The key predictive factors identified could help optimise biochar production and targeted amendments, potentially improving soil health and achieving carbon neutrality in agroecosystems.</description>

      <title>Biochar and bentonite application improves aeolian sandy soil health and enhances soil carbon sequestration and emission reduction potential</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-86636-1</link>
      <description>Liang Weijing, Tang Jiaxi, Li Yu, Song Sizhu, Xiaoyu Jiang, Hao Liyu, Tao Shuyu, He Miaomiao, Scientific Reports. 15(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406488018

                Aeolian sandy soil is barren and readily leads to low fertilizer utilization rates and yields. Therefore, it is imperative to improve the water and fertilizer retention capacity of these soils. In this paper, three kinds of biochar (rice husk, corn stalk, and bamboo charcoal) and bentonite were used as amendments in the first year of the experiment. In the second year, only corn stalk biochar was applied. The effects of biochar and bentonite on the physicochemical and biological characteristics of aeolian sandy soil and corn agronomic traits were studied through a 2-year field experiment, and the carbon sequestration and emission reduction potential of biochar in aeolian sandy soil were explored. The results showed that the input of biochar and bentonite effectively improved water content and reduced soil bulk density. Compared with the same treatment in the first year, the content of water-stable aggregates with particle sizes greater than 0.25 mm, mean weight diameter and geometric mean diameter of the corn stalk biochar mixed with bentonite treatment significantly increased in the second year. Biochar and bentonite significantly increased the soil organic matter content, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium contents, and CEC increased by 150.4%. Soil available phosphorus increased 2.6 times compared with that of the fertilizer treatment. Soil alkali-hydrolyzable nitrogen content increased by 211.5%, respectively. The plant height, leaf area index and ground dry matter mass also increased significantly, and the corn yield increased by 36.6% in response to the mixed application of 1.9 t/hm2 corn stalk biochar and 12 t/hm2 bentonite. The contents of urease, sucrase and catalase increased first and then decreased with crop growth through the jointing, silking and maturity stages. The microbial carbon content increased 2.4 times in the second year when corn stalk biochar was applied compared with that in the first year. The carbon sequestration potential of biochar application was equivalent to offsetting CO2 emissions by approximately 100 million tons per year of the study.</description>

      <title>A GIS-Based Estimation of Bioenergy Potential from Cereal and Legume Straw Biomasses in Alentejo, Portugal</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app15020868</link>
      <description>Abel Rodrigues, Alexandre Gon&#231;alves, Benvindo Ma&#231;&#227;s, A.M. Cordeiro, Paulo Brito, Applied Sciences. 15(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406489209

                Portugal exhibits a large deficit in cereals with an import/export ratio of about 18%. Alentejo is a southern vast plain region, which is the largest cereal producer in the country, with about 80% of the total cereal area. The region also shows a huge local energy deficit with a ratio of about 17% between spent and produced energy. In this context, this work used GIS modeling based on available digital geographical information on soil and topographic conditions in Alentejo for estimating optimal production areas of four main classes of cereal and legume classes, which were wheat, barley, oat/lupin, and triticale/broad bean. The estimated areas were validated by 199 sample points in the field and allowed to quantify a potential of bioenergy production from straw biomasses based on yields of biomass net calorific values of 18 MJkg&#8722;1 and yields of 6, 9, 6, and 9 tons/ha for the four classes in the order indicated. The estimated areas allocated to the cereal and legume classes covered approximately four municipalities in the region. The total modeled area in Alentejo for the four cultivation classes was 44,980 ha. The results showed that even if 50% of the estimated total straw biomass produced was used for animal feed, the estimated bioenergy production of the remaining half biomass would be of about 2940 TJy&#8722;1, or about 12.5% of the actual regional energy production, which is an energy amount able to supply 35 organic Rankine cycle (ORC) 2.5 MW cogeneration units and 347 boilers with 125 kW thermal power, delivering renewable electricity to the grid, and heating facilities as diverse as buildings, nursing homes, or horticultural greenhouses. More than 160 kton of CO2 fossil emissions would also be avoided, delivering a contribution to mitigating effects of climate change. By contributing to the reduction of the large cereal dependence and the carbon emissions of the country, the proposed strategy would contribute to increasing the decentralized bioenergy production for applications in buildings and local facilities, significantly boosting the socio-economic dynamics of rural areas involved.</description>

                Ophthalmology stands as one of the most rapidly evolving fields in medicine, characterised by groundbreaking advancements in therapeutics and surgery over the last few decades. The introduction of transformative treatments for ocular conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinal vein occlusions, diabetic macular oedema, genetic disorders, and uveitis, has significantly enhanced patient outcomes and reshaped clinical paradigms. Simultaneously, technological innovations and refined surgical techniques have ushered in a new era for eye surgeons, enabling procedures that are safer, faster, and more precise than ever before. This special issue, Updates in Ocular Therapeutics and Surgery -Volume III, builds upon the foundation of its successful predecessors, continuing the journey of exploring the latest therapeutic and surgical advances. It aims to consolidate contemporary knowledge, highlight cutting-edge research, and chart the trajectory of future developments in the field.The contributions in this issue underscore the dynamic interplay between clinical innovation and translational research. They reflect the commitment of ophthalmologists, researchers, and industry pioneers to address complex ocular diseases with novel solutions while enhancing the efficacy and safety of surgical interventions.By bringing together a diverse array of studies and reviews, this volume aspires to serve as a valuable resource for clinicians, researchers, and trainees. It not only encapsulates the current state-of-the-art in ocular therapeutics and surgery but also seeks to inspire future inquiries that will further refine the practice of ophthalmology.Guo et al. investigated the therapeutic potential of Urolithin A in addressing delayed corneal epithelial wound healing. By inhibiting ferroptosis, a form of oxidative stress-induced cell death, Urolithin A demonstrated significant promise in mitigating hyperosmotic stress and promoting healing.Li et al. evaluated the efficacy and safety of CO2 laser-assisted sclerectomy for secondary glaucoma following vitrectomy. Their findings underscored the advantages of this novel approach in achieving substantial intraocular pressure reduction with a lower risk of complications. Similarly, He et al. performed a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the synergistic effect of anti-VEGF therapy combined with Ahmed valve implantation in neovascular glaucoma, revealing enhanced surgical success rates and improved long-term outcomes compared to valve implantation alone.Liu et al. presented an innovative approach to managing Descemet's membrane detachment post-cataract surgery. Their technique of using air tamponade offered a minimally invasive and highly effective solution to this challenging complication. Ning et al. contributed a bibliometric analysis of 20 years of research on posterior chamber phakic intraocular lenses (pIOLs), identifying key research areas including clinical outcomes, complications, and postoperative visual quality. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights for advancing the field.Wang and Zheng introduced the Prism and Maddox Rod Test as a reliable and cost-effective tool for determining surgical measurements in type III acute acquired comitant esotropia. Their work demonstrated its precision and applicability in improving alignment outcomes post-surgery.In a review of corneal epithelial repair mechanisms, Gong et al. detailed the critical roles of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-&#945;, highlighting their therapeutic potential in ocular surface disease management. Ye et al. proposed a modified technique for the intrascleral fixation of three-piece foldable intraocular lenses using Hoffman pockets. This approach minimised complications and improved lens stability, offering a refined method for secondary IOL implantation.In the domain of ocular trauma, Sather 3 rd et al. examined the outcomes of secondary surgeries following open globe injury repair. Their findings emphasised the importance of a structured surgical rehabilitative process, with approximately 50% of patients achieving ambulatory vision and 30% attaining reading vision. K&#246;rber et al. explored the use of picosecond ultrashort laser pulses in ophthalmic surgeries, showcasing their superior precision and reduced collateral damage compared to traditional nanosecond lasers. Their research paves the way for safer and more efficient laser-based procedures.Finally, Jin et al. investigated the efficacy and safety of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in acute nonarteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION). PRP treatment significantly improved capillary perfusion of the optic nerve head and short-term visual acuity, demonstrating its potential as a novel therapeutic option for this challenging condition. This collection of studies reflects the vibrancy and innovation in ocular therapeutics and surgery. We hope that readers will find this volume as engaging and enlightening as we did in editing and presenting it, and that it inspires future endeavours aimed at further refining the care of patients with ocular diseases.</description>

N&#248;rskov Festschrift".I received a PhD in physics from &#197;rhus University, Denmark, under the inspiring supervision of Bengt Lundqvist. After postdoc experiences at &#197;rhus University, IBM Yorktown Heights Research Laboratories, and the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen, I found it hard to find a faculty position in Denmark in the early 1980s. There simply were no openings. Fortunately, I was offered a position at the Haldor Tops&#248;e Research Laboratories&#9472;strongly supported by Haldor Tops&#248;e, Henrik Tops&#248;e, and Bjerne Clausen. The involvement with the Tops&#248;e company, one of the world's largest suppliers of catalysts and technology for the chemical and energy industry, influenced my career in many ways. Most importantly, it became clear to me that a theory of heterogeneous catalysis was essential to further advance this important area of science and technology. I kept that focus when starting an academic career, and kept the association with the Tops&#248;e company, now serving on its Board of Directors.In the late 80s the Danish government started to realize that they were about to lose a whole generation of scientists and instituted some special professorships with applicants competing in all fields and at all universities in the country. That got me started at the Technical University of Denmark building up a research group with the funding that came with the professorship. The focus was on understanding surface reactivity as well as impurities in bulk metals.The impurity work started an extremely fruitful collaboration with Flemming Besenbacher at &#197;rhus University that continued for the next decades. With Besenbacher, I founded the Center for Atomic- scale Materials Physics with large-scale funding from the first round of grants from the Danish National Research Foundation. Here my group established the beginning of an understanding of the surface chemical bond. It started with simple models like the effective medium theory. Later, as more accurate density functional calculations became possible, it formed the foundation of the d-band model, or Hammer&#8211;N&#248;rskov model, of chemisorption. The model allowed an understanding of trends in bond energies of adsorbates on transition metal surfaces including variations from metal to metal, the effect of alloying, the effect of structure and defects, and the effect of strain. The interplay with the experimental groups of Flemming Besenbacher, Ib Chorkendorff and Anders Nilsson became extremely important in supporting the theory efforts.Combining DFT calculations of trends in adsorption energies and transition state energies of elemental surface processes with microkinetic modeling opened the possibility of calculating trends in full catalytic rates, for the first time. This also opened the possibility of making predictions for new catalysts, several of which were synthesized and tested in the groups of Claus Hviid Christensen and of Ib Chorkendorff.I established a Center for Atomic-scale Materials Design with Karsten Jacobsen, Kristian Thygesen, Thomas Bligaard, and Jan Rossmeisl in the late 2000s with funding from the Lundbeck Foundation. An important new effort was aimed at an understanding electrocatalysis. The theory of electrocatalysis was not nearly as developed as the theory of heterogeneous catalysis in terms of a quantitative description of processes and trends in reactivity. One aspect that makes the theoretical description of adsorption and reaction processes at the solid&#8211;liquid interface extremely demanding is the description of the solvated reactants. We developed the so-called computational hydrogen electrode, which opened up for a description of thermo-chemical trends in electrocatalysis. Our first application provided an understanding of trends in reactivity of different catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) providing insights into why Pt is the best elemental electrocatalyst for the cathode process in fuel cells, and how it can be made even better by alloying.The discovery of scaling relations between adsorption energies of different intermediates and between transition energies and adsorption energies opened the possibility of reducing the enormous complexity associated with the calculation of trends for full catalytic rates. We found that many adsorption energies of CHx species scaled and it took us some time to understand the physical basis for this amazing effect well enough to publish the result. Later, we found that this is extremely general. The fact that many activation energies scale with reaction energies, known as Br&#248;nsted&#8211;Evans&#8211;Polanyi relations, have been realized for many years. The scaling we discovered of adsorbed species is considerably more general than that. First, it includes scaling between adsorption energies of intermediates, and therefore transition state energies not only scale with reaction energies but with any chosen representative adsorption energy. This gives an enormous simplification.Moving to Stanford and SLAC in 2010, DOE funding to a new Catalysis center, SUNCAT, allowed a large expansion of the theory efforts, and Thomas Bligaard, Frank Abild Petersen, Felix Studt, and Alexandra Vojvodic moved along to SLAC to form the core theory group in this center. The Center also included a number of outstanding experimentalists, in particular Anders Nilsson, Tom Jaramillo, Matteo Cargnello, Stacey Bent, and Zhenan Bao.A systematic theory of transition metal catalysis was developed in those years. We showed that the scaling relations are extremely general for many surfaces and reactions, and eventually you can plot the rate as a function of a few adsorption energies, or descriptors, for any reaction in a volcano plot directly identifying the optimum catalyst. Sabatier had postulated such a relationship between a bond energy and the rate many years before. The scaling relations directly showed that a single or a few bond energies can in fact be used as a descriptor, it defined what the descriptor should be, and most importantly, it made volcano relations quantitative, allowing its use to search for new catalysts. Many reactions were analyzed including hydrogenation reactions and methane activation reactions.Another development that accelerated considerably during the time at Stanford was the description of electrochemical processes for energy conversion, including models of activation energies in electrocatalysis. This included the oxygen evolution reaction, the CO and CO2 reduction reactions and the N2 reduction reaction. For the latter we developed an understanding of the requirements for a high ammonia selectivity, something that laid the foundation for the thinking in the experimental groups we worked with (Ib Chorkendorff at DTU and Tom Jaramillo and Matteo Cargnello at Stanford).In 2018 I moved back to DTU in a Villum Kann Rasmussen Chair and with good funding from the Villum Foundation. I also took on the position as Chair of the Danish National Research Foundation. The work on electrochemical ammonia synthesis became a cornerstone. Additional work on thermal ammonia synthesis resulted in the discovery of a new promotion mechanism. Surfaces with a spin moment bind adsorbates weaker than the non spin polarized surface of the same metal, and certain adsorbates quench the spin in their vicinity and thus act as promotors by lowering the energy of transition state of important elementary steps. Experimental work in the Chorkendorff and Kibsgaard groups validated the effect for several ammonia synthesis catalysts. Another new effort was in translating the theory we developed to understand trends in heterogeneous catalysis to homogeneous catalysts. All of this work continues ....In all my career I have been fortunate to have worked with outstanding students and postdocs as well as some of the best scientists in the field. I have mentioned some of the colleagues in the above but it would be completely impossible to do all students and postdocs justice in this short piece. Let me just thank everyone profoundly. The picture above, taken at a conference celebrating my 70th birthday, shows many of the students and postdocs I have worked with over the years.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorJens K.

                Seaweed cultivation holds significant importance in addressing global challenges.On the one hand,it aids in alleviating the food crisis.On the other hand,it offers substantial ecological benefits,such as enhancing carbon sequestration,facilitating nitrogen cycling,and mitigating eutrophication(He et al.,2008;Wu et al.,2015;Mantri et al.,2023).Globally,the dominant cultivated economic seaweeds include Laminaria spp.,Kappaphycus spp.,Gracilaria spp.,Neopyropia spp.,and Undaria spp.(Park et al.,2021;Khan et al.,2024).In 2022,the annual global production of seaweed is estimated to be approximately 36.4 million metric tons(live weight),with red algae accounting for about 55.8% and brown algae for approximately 43.8%(FAO,2024).Asia constitutes the principal region for seaweed cultivation,representing over 97% of global production,with China(about 60%),Indonesia(about 25%),South Korea(about 5%),and the Philippines(about 4%)being the largest contributors to this industry(Khan et al.,2024;Liu et al.,2024).Among them,the Neopyropia species,a type of high-end red algae,is highly favored among consumers(Li et al.,2023)and possesses rich edible and medicinal values(Subramaniyan et al.,2021;Zhao et al.,2023).It is frequently utilized for the production of foods such as laver sushi and laver pancakes.Consequently,the significance of laver cultivation is self-evident.China boasts the world's largest laver cultivation area,with total production reaching 209,939 metric tons(dry weight)in 2023(Fishery Administration Bureau of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs,2024).The main cultivated laver species include Neopyropia haitanensis,Neopyropia yezoensis,Neopyropia acanthophora,and Neopyropia dentata(Wang et al.,2020).Notably,Jiangsu Province,China,serves as the leading production area for the highly sought-after N.yezoensis(Figure 1).The N.yezoensis aquaculture industry in the Subei intertidal zone of Jiangsu Province originated in the 1970s of the 20th century(Liu et al.,2021a).After more than 50 years of development,the intertidal zone in Jiangsu Province has become the largest global N.yezoensis aquaculture area,leading both nationally and globally.For instance,in 2023,the area of laver cultivation in Jiangsu Province reached 33,393 hectares,approximately 51.81% of the total national laver cultivation area.During the same year,the production of laver in Jiangsu Province reached 35,936 metric tons(dry weight),accounting for about 17.12% of the total national laver production(Fishery Administration Bureau of Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs,2024).The industry is of considerable scale and has comprehensively enhanced the coastal economic development and industrial reputation of Jiangsu Province.Furthermore,many impoverished individuals have achieved poverty alleviation and wealth accumulation through seaweed cultivation(Li et al.,2011).Nevertheless,the laver cultivation industry in Jiangsu Province is progressively encountering certain challenges,such as extreme marine events and disasters.This opinion article aims to identify the key factors affecting laver cultivation in Jiangsu Province and proposes recommendations for its sustainable development.For the growth stages of seaweed,extreme climate changes can lead to cellular and subcellular damage in the thalli,ultimately affecting its growth,quality,and yield(Khan et al.,2024).Currently,the negative impact of climate change on seaweed aquaculture is a long-term and widespread issue encountered in global aquaculture processes(Veenhof et al.,2024),which is difficult to resolve effectively in the short term.Over the past six decades,the sea surface temperature in the Southern Yellow Sea(SYS)has generally shown an increasing trend,with a warming amplitude of approximately 0.61&#176;C.This indicates that under the backdrop of global warming,the SYS region has exhibited a warming trend(Guo et al.,2024).Concurrently,the interannual and multidecadal variability of sea surface temperature in the SYS is also associated with large-scale climatic factors such as El Ni&#241;o-Southern Oscillation(ENSO)and Pacific Decadal Oscillation(PDO)(Wang &amp; Yu,2014),leading to anomalous warming of regional seawater temperatures in certain years.Elevated seawater temperatures indirectly promote the frequent occurrence of diseases and other factors that hinder the growth of N.yezoensis.Currently,climate warming is leading to frequent occurrences of seedling rot,slow growth,and significant reductions in yield during the cultivation of Neopyropia,resulting in economic losses for the laver cultivation industry in the SYS region in recent years(Figure 2A).For instance,from late 2016 to mid-2017,influenced by factors such as abnormally high temperatures in the Haizhou Bay area,the production of N.yezoensis in Lianyun District,Lianyungang City,Jiangsu Province,was severely reduced,with a decrease of about 60% compared to the previous year(Lianyun District People's Government,2017).Extreme weather events triggered by climate change also warrant attention.At the end of April 2021,an infrequent event featuring extreme winds and thunderstorms occurred in the Subei intertidal zone of the SYS,with wind gusts reaching level 14.This event resulted in direct economic losses exceeding 140 million RMB Yuan in Nantong City,Jiangsu Province(Lu &amp; Du,2022),and the large-scale collapse of Neopyropia cultivation rafts(Lu &amp; Du,2022).Tens of thousands of raft components,including ropes and bamboo poles(Figure 2B),are being swept into the ocean(Sun et al.,2022a),causing economic losses to laver farmers.It affected the smooth progress of the Neopyropia raft recovery operations,and in addition,caused casualties,either directly or indirectly(CCTV,2021).Similarly,in January 2016,Lianyungang City,Jiangsu Province experienced severe sea ice and strong winds caused by extremely cold weather.This affected over 7,000 hectares of N.yezoensis cultivation area,leading to incalculable economic losses for local farmers(Sohu,2016).In addition,rising global CO2 concentrations contribute to ocean acidification,which can impact interspecific competition among seaweeds(Feng et al.,2024).Although the elevated CO2 levels alleviate the competitive relationship between N.yezoensis and the harmful epiphyte Ulva species(e.g.,Ulva prolifera),the long-term perspective indicates a growing competitive advantage for Ulva under this climate change scenario(Sun et al.,2021).Traditionally,N.yezoensis is considered a cold-tolerant seaweed,whereas U.prolifera exhibits a greater capacity to endure higher temperatures compared to N.yezoensis.Micropropagules of U.prolifera are persistently present in the SYS region(Cao et al.,2023;Xia et al.,2024a),and the areas on the raft components not colonized by laver are also conducive to the attachment of U.prolifera,leading to the subsequent occupation of ecological niches by U.prolifera on the raft structures(Zhang et al.,2019a).Concurrently,as U.prolifera matures,it demonstrates a stronger ability to absorb nutrients than N.yezoensis,thereby allowing the epiphytically growing U.prolifera to gradually establish a growth advantage(Shan,2022).This results in Ulva species with an enhanced capability to occupy ecological niches,which subsequently impacts the normal growth of laver and affects the future development of Neopyropia aquaculture in the SYS region.Neopyropia yezoensis is susceptible to various diseases during cultivation and growth due to the impact of global climate change,harmful microbial infection,and overcrowding during cultivation(Kim et al.,2014).Common diseases include seedling rot,chytrid blight,green spot disease,and white rot(Qiu et al.,2019;Yang et al.,2020;Bae et al.,2024),which frequently lead to the genetic characterization decline of laver populations.In addition,the coastal waters of Jiangsu Province are severely eutrophic(Liu et al.,2013),and heavily polluted sea areas are particularly prone to harmful pathogens proliferation.These pathogens negatively impact seaweed growth,ultimately reducing laver yield and causing significant economic losses for local farmers.For instance,in 2004,approximately 5,000 hectares of N.yezoensis in the Nantong City maritime area suffered from severe rot,resulting in an estimated loss of 60 million RMB Yuan(Yangtze Evening Post,2004).Similarly,in 2016,over 1,300 hectares of N.yezoensis in the Rudong County maritime area of Nantong City experienced rot,with cost losses alone amounting to around 40 million RMB Yuan,causing economic losses to more than 3,000 laver farmers(Wang,2016).In January 2019,134 hectares of N.yezoensis in the Yancheng City maritime area exhibited rot,which was caused by the pathogenic bacterium Opliidopsis sp.(He et al.,2021).It should be clarified that seaweed cultivation inevitably faces diseases to varying degrees(Khan et al.,2024).These diseases encountered during laver cultivation are not unique to China but represent a global issue(Yang et al.,2020).For example,between 2013 and 2014,an outbreak of green spot disease in the laver farms in Sunchon,South Korea,could cause complete rot of laver thalli within 1-2 days,resulting in a loss of 1.1 million USD,equivalent to 10.7% of total farm sales(Kim et al.,2014).The sudden onset of such diseases during N.yezoensis cultivation often prevents timely and effective mitigation measures to reduce disease damage,ultimately leading to substantial losses for laver farmers.Neopyropia yezoensis cultivation demands high-quality seawater and thrives best in waters with moderate flow velocity and strong water exchange capacity(He et al.,2018).In Jiangsu Province,suitable cultivation areas have been largely exploited,limiting the potential for further expansion of the cultivation scale.Similarly,N.yezoensis struggles to grow in low-nutrient sea areas(Huang et al.,2023).Although the high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus in Jiangsu's coastal waters support the growth of Neopyropia,the extensive cultivation area and high cultivation density inevitably restrict growth due to the limited carrying capacity of the sea area(Shan,2022).Taking the outer radial sandbars of Dafeng District in Yancheng City as an example,the laver cultivation scale once spanned a continuous distribution of 13,000 hectares.However,the excessive scale of cultivation adversely affected seawater exchange within the cultivation area(Shan,2022).As a result,laver in the center parts of the cultivation zone could not receive sufficient nutrient replenishment,leading to deficiencies essential for growth(Shan,2022).Additionally,the close proximity of cultivation facilities also facilitates the rapid spread of diseases,further reducing laver yields(Shan,2022).Concurrently,some marine areas in Jiangsu Province have been engaged in aquaculture activities that do not comply with regulations established by the Chinese government(Figure 2C).This noncompliance has exacerbated the scope and cultivation density of laver cultivation activities,creating additional challenges.Lin et al.(2021)identified two special utilization zones and six port shipping areas in Jiangsu Province where unreasonable or illegal laver cultivation activities occurred.These activities involved a total of 135.84 hectares,primarily concentrated in locations such as Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant Special Utilization Zone,Ganyu Port Special Utilization Zone,Shiqiao Port Shipping Area,Xuwei Port Shipping Area,Ganyu Port Shipping Area,Lvsi Port Shipping Area,Xiaomiao Hong Port Shipping Area,and Jinniu Port Shipping Area(Lin et al.,2021).Green seaweed blooms have persisted in the SYS for eighteen consecutive years(Zhang et al.,2019b;Xia et al.,2024b),predominantly caused by U.prolifera,which has led to significant adverse effects on marine aquaculture and related fisheries industries(Cao et al.,2023;Yao et al.,2024).On the one hand,the attachment of various Ulva species to laver cultivation facilities(Han et al.,2013;Huo et al.,2015)competes with Neopyropia for ecological niches and nutrients(Figure 2D),thereby impeding laver growth.On the other hand,removing attached green seaweeds during production incurs substantial labor costs for laver farmers(Sun et al.,2022a).Notably,the outbreak of large-scale green tide disasters near laver cultivation areas is rarely observed globally,with no similar reports from other countries or regions' laver cultivation areas.To effectively mitigate the scale of green tide outbreaks,the Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China is currently focusing on reducing the biomass of U.prolifera attached to laver cultivation rafts in Jiangsu Province(Liu et al.,2021b;Xia et al.,2022;He et al.,2023;Sun et al.,2022b),and has taken measures to curb illegal occupation of marine areas for seaweed cultivation(Jiangsu Laver Association,2020).Additionally,laver farmers are encouraged to proactively adjust their raft cultivation schedules,including withdrawing facilities in advance during the production cycle and conducting early cleanup of green seaweeds(Figure 2E).These measures are aimed at maximizing ecological benefits(Sun et al.,2022a).However,these actions also impacted seaweed yields in Jiangsu Province,posing challenges to the long-term formation of a "common interest group" that balances fishery production and green tide control.For instance,in 2021,Jiangsu Province collectively retired approximately 4,000 hectares of laver cultivation and reduced the area of sea used for laver cultivation by about 6,400 hectares.By May 8,2021,all laver cultivation facilities were brought ashore,prematurely ending the laver production period spanned the late 2020 to mid-2021.This adjustment resulted in a revenue reduction of 1-1.2 billion RMB Yuan for the province's laver cultivation industry(Diao &amp; Ma,2021)and led to widespread dissatisfaction among regional laver farmers about the potential economic impacts of green tide disaster management.Furthermore,since 2023,the funds allocated for green tide disaster prevention have nearly approached the actual direct economic benefits of laver cultivation in Jiangsu Province.Taking 2024 as a case in point,the annual investment in green tide prevention special funds(including both central and local government financial allocations)has exceeded one billion RMB Yuan,underscoring the financial burden of addressing this ecological challenge.The phenomenon of golden tide disasters impacting the laver cultivation industry is currently observed only in the marine regions of Jiangsu Province.The proliferation of Sargassum horneri,the primary species responsible for golden tides,has posed significant challenges to laver cultivation activities in Jiangsu Province in recent years.Since 2016,large-scale gatherings of drifting S.horneri have been frequently observed in the coastal waters off Jiangsu during winter and spring(Wang et al.,2023).The arrival of the golden tide "algal mat" in the laver raft cultivation area(Figure 2F)led to the structural collapse of some rafts(Zhuang et al.,2020).Moreover,golden tide seaweed entangled in the laver cultivation nets hinders Neopyropia from conducting photosynthesis effectively,leading to damage during its growth stage.To address this issue,laver farmers are compelled to manually remove S.horneri tangled around the rafts,which not only increases labor costs but also causes the detachment of Neopyropia during this process.Such disruptions often result in significant financial losses,amounting to hundreds of millions of RMB Yuan for local laver farmers(Liu et al.,2021c).For instance,from the winter of 2016 to the spring of 2017,the golden tide disaster severely impacted the laver cultivation industry in Jiangsu Province,causing economic losses of up to 500 million RMB Yuan in the laver cultivation industries of Yancheng and Nantong cities(Liu et al.,2018).Currently,there is no effective method to mitigate the golden tide macroalgal biomass at their source,as the origin of recent golden tide outbreaks in China remains unclear(Wang et al.,2024).Therefore,when laver cultivation activities are affected by golden tide disasters,manual clearance remains the only viable approach to minimize economic losses.Given the current climate warming trend,effective alleviation measures are challenging(Liu et al.,2021b).In areas where N.yezoensis is no longer suitable for growth,it could be worthwhile to gradually attempt the cultivation of heat-resistant strains,such as N.haitanensis(Zhou et al.,2023),which can contribute to the sustainable development of the laver cultivation industry in Jiangsu Province.Following the successful pilot cultivation of N.haitanensis in the SYS(Figure 2G),some laver farmers have opted to cease the cultivation of N.yezoensis in favor of N.haitanensis,while others have initiated experiments in the rotation planting of N.yezoensis and N.haitanensis.Taking 2024 as an example,Lianyun District People's Government of Lianyungang City has encouraged laver farmers to engage in the rotational cultivation of N.haitanensis and N.yezoensis(Liandao Subdistrict,2024).Laver farmers in Liandao Subdistrict have collectively piloted the cultivation of N.haitanensis over an area of approximately 800 hectares,achieving a bountiful harvest in October 2024,with an estimated annual yield of 15 tons per hectare(live weight),resulting in an annual output value of up to 130 million RMB Yuan(Liandao Subdistrict,2024).At present,the Jiangsu Provincial Government's promotion of the pilot rotational planting and cultivation scheme for N.yezoensis and N.haitanensis has achieved initial success and is deemed worthy of further promotion and application.At present,the Chinese government has focused on addressing the illegal occupation of maritime areas for aquaculture,explicitly prohibiting the establishment of new aquaculture projects that occupy natural coastlines or fall within ecological protection red lines(Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China,2024).It has gradually cleared areas of illegal and unlicensed Neopyropia cultivation and withdrawn cultivation within the ecological red line areas(Figure 2C).Meanwhile,efforts are underway to optimize the spatial planning and layout of laver cultivation by adhering to principles of high-quality,ecological,and standardized development.These efforts gradually transferring laver cultivation rafts from nearshore tidal flats to deeper sea areas and strengthening the management and supervision of no-culture zones,limited-culture zones,and aquaculture zones(Jiangsu Laver Association,2020;Lianyungang Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Affairs,2021).In addition,research and promotion of technologies to prevent the attachment of Ulva on laver cultivation rafts are being carried out(Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Geology,2024).Efforts are also being made to strengthen the management of aquaculture waste,such as discarded Ulva species by promoting the centralized treatment and resource utilization of aquaculture production waste.These measures aim to reduce the initial biomass of U.prolifera,the dominant species in green tide outbreaks in the SYS,providing a scientific basis for the ecological cultivation of laver and green tide prevention.Simultaneously,relevant government departments are researching the resource and environmental carrying capacities under the guidance of superior authorities to provide theoretical and scientific foundations for determining the appropriate cultivation scale of Neopyropia in Jiangsu Province.In response to excessive laver cultivation density,the government recommends reducing high-density cultivation and gradually guiding farmers and enterprises to control cultivation density within a reasonable range(Lianyungang Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Affairs,2021).Appropriately reducing cultivation density also helps slow the spread of diseases during the cultivation process.To address these issues,Shan(2022)suggests controlling the continuous distribution scale of laver cultivation rafts and reducing the overall cultivation area.Furthermore,the government or industry associations could coordinate to divide the continuous distribution areas into several smaller zones,increasing the spacing between these zones to allow for sufficient seawater exchange.At the same time,individual farmers or aquaculture enterprises could reduce the density of raft arrangements,expanding the current spacing from approximately 4 meters to 6-7 meters(Shan,2022).This approach will ensure seawater exchange,reduce disease incidence,and effectively increase the yield per unit area of laver cultivation.There is a significant demand for N.yezoensis cultivated in China(Li et al.,2023)from countries including Japan,the United States,and South Korea.To meet this demand,it is crucial to maintain the cultivation scale of N.yezoensis in Jiangsu Province(Figure 1)and other regions of China.Yang et al.(2021)reported that in the lower-salinity marine waters of Nantong City,elevated ocean temperatures suppress the activity of antioxidant enzymes and the expression of related genes within N.yezoensis,rendering the seaweed more vulnerable to disease and decay.To address these issues,a progressive relocation of the N.yezoensis cultivation industry from the southern coastal waters of Jiangsu Province to the cities of Yancheng and Lianyungang is imperative.Notably,parts of this industry have already been transferred to the marine areas of Shandong and Liaoning provinces in China,where the colder seawater conditions during the same cultivation period are more conducive to N.yezoensis growth and can mitigate the risk of disease and decay(Yang et al.,2021).Moreover,it is anticipated that by 2050,the suitable growth range for N.yezoensis in the East Asian region will expand to include the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia(Zhou et al.,2023).Shifting the N.yezoensis industrial chain towards higher-latitude regions is expected to enhance both yield and quality.Furthermore,considering the frequent outbreaks of green tides and other biological disasters in mid- and low-latitude regions(Yao et al.,2024),as well as the impact of ocean warming,algal bloom outbreaks,are expected to occur earlier and expand further(Qi et al.,2022).Gradually relocating the laver cultivation industry to higher-latitude regions may help reduce the impact of algal bloom disasters and ensure the sustainable development of the industry.The laver cultivation industry,characterized by its labor-intensive nature,requires substantial labor input throughout the production cycle while typically yielding modest economic returns.In the future,integrating the laver cultivation cycle with Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture(IMTA)models(Kang et al.,2013)may help mitigate significant monoculture risks and unlock considerable economic potential(Lianyungang Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Rural Affairs,2021).For example,in 2021,Lianyungang City established a new Integrated Multi-Trophic Aquaculture(IMTA)management model incorporating the co-cultivation of shellfish and seaweeds.Demonstration farming under this model produced positive results,achieving an economic benefit of 3.19 million RMB Yuan and generating significant carbon sequestration effects(Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China,2023).With the establishment of IMTA systems and supporting infrastructure,additional opportunities for developing recreational and ecotourism farms,such as 'new energy+' marine farms(Yi &amp; Li,2024),can emerge.This synergy between agriculture and recreational fishing has the potential to maximize economic benefits and increase income for laver farmers.However,the adoption and refinement of such development models still require ongoing feasibility studies and remain highly dependent on the maturity of the service industry at the national level.Currently,local governments at various levels in China are gradually formulating relevant laws and regulations.For instance,from January 1,2025,to December 31,2029,the Shandong Provincial Government will permit recreational fishing activities within marine ranching areas(Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs,2024).This initiative is expected to promote the integration of marine aquaculture with recreational fishing,enhancing the overall income of farmers.In addition,by further integrating laver cultivation into carbon emission trading markets and exploring blue carbon economic development pathways,future carbon sink revenues could support both the advancement of laver cultivation and the stabilization of marine ecosystems,thereby achieving mutually beneficial outcomes.For example,leveraging the blue carbon value of laver(Cangnan County People's Government,2022),Yonggui Aquaculture Family Farm in Rudong County has secured a "laver carbon credit loan" valued at 1.75 million RMB Yuan,using future revenue rights from carbon reduction and sequestration generated by laver cultivation as collateral(The People's Government of Nantong Municipality,2023).Notably,the Chinese government is actively promoting the regulation and orderly development of carbon sink trading.The "Interim Regulations on the Administration of Carbon Emission Rights Trading",effective May 1,2024(The State Council of the People's Republic of China,2024),provide institutional guarantees for carbon emission rights trading at the national legislative level.However,the realization of specific economic,ecological,and social benefits still depends on the establishment of a comprehensive carbon sink trading accounting standard system.At present,the transformation of the laver fishery economic model is still in its early exploratory stage and requires further practical innovation and robust government policy support.This opinion article systematically outlines the current state of the laver(N.yezoensis)cultivation industry in Jiangsu Province,the challenges it faces,and strategies for sustainable development.Jiangsu Province,as the world's largest cultivation area for N.yezoensis,plays a critical role in local economic development and provides a substantial supply of high-quality laver to the global market.However,factors such as climate change,diseases,high-density cultivation,green tides,and golden tide disasters pose severe threats to laver cultivation.To address these challenges,we propose key development strategies,including the cultivation of heat-resistant laver varieties,improving standardization and order in laver cultivation practices,relocating the industry chain to higher latitude regions,and transforming the laver fishery economic model.The implementation of these strategies will support the sustainable development and industrial upgrading of Jiangsu Province's laver cultivation industry,as well as the formulation of long-term aquaculture development strategies.Additionally,these measures will contribute to marine ecosystem protection,achieving a win-win situation for both economic and ecological benefits.</description>

      <title>Impact of micro-scale characteristics of shale reservoirs on gasdepletion behavior: A microscale discrete model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.46690/ager.2025.02.06</link>
      <description>Wangxing Cheng, Y. Jay Guo, Guanglei Cui, Derek Elsworth, Yuling Tan, Zhejun Pan, ADVANCES IN GEO-ENERGY RESEARCH. 15(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406336208

                Shale gas has become increasingly significant in the global energy supply. Mineral heterogeneity in shales importantly impacts gas transport within the shale matrix and therefore the depletion history curve. A microscale discrete coupling model is introduced to clarify mass transfer and mechanical interactions, as well as their impact on gas transport properties, ranging from individual mineral through ensemble field scale. The model uses a mineral morphology thin-section obtained through tescan integrated mineral analyzer with the mechanical parameters, controlling both elastic and viscosity behavior of each mineral, achieved through nanoindentation. A coupled model for poromechanical evolution is proposed and solved using COMSOL. The applicability of the model results are validated against field data using a dimensionless approach. This confirms that in the early stages of gas depletion, gas is primarily liberated from inorganic minerals, whereas in later stages, it is predominantly sourced from adsorbed gas from the organic matter. Over time, the permeability of the inorganic minerals decreases, and a higher Young's modulus of the minerals results in a greater ultimate permeability ratio. Evolution of the effective diffusion coefficient for the organic matter is controlled by multiple components. A negative correlation exists between mineral grain size and the creep effects, indicating that larger grain sizes result in smaller creep magnitudes during gas production. The Young's modulus of inorganic matter is inversely correlated with the diffusion coefficient, while an increase in the Young's modulus in the organic matter corresponds to a higher diffusion coefficient. The proposed model complements the traditional continuum dual-medium method and provides a clearer understanding of the interactions between minerals during gas depletion behavior.
