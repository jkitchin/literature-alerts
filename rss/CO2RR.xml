                The application of supermolecular naonostructures in the photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted increasing attentions. However, it still faces significant challenges, such as low selectivity for multi-electron products and poor stability. Here, the cuprous oxide (Cu2O)-modified zinc tetraphenylporphyrin ultrathin nanosheets (ZnTPP NSs) are successfully constructed through the aqueous chemical reaction. Comprehensive characterizations confirm the formation of type-II heterojunction between Cu2O and ZnTPP in Cu2O@ZnTPP, and the electron transfer from Cu2O to ZnTPP through the Zn-O-Cu bond under the static contact. Under the visible-light irradiation (&#955; &gt; 420 nm), the optimized Cu2O@ZnTPP sample as catalyst for photocatalytic CO2RR exhibits the methane (CH4) evolution rate of 120.9 &#956;mol/g/h, which is &#8764; 4 and &#8764; 10 times those of individual ZnTPP NSs (28.0 &#956;mol/g/h) and Cu2O (12.8 &#956;mol/g/h), respectively. Meanwhile, the CH4 selectivity of &#8764; 98.7 % and excellent stability can be achieved. Further experiments reveal that Cu2O@ZnTPP has higher photocatalytic conversion efficiency than Cu2O and ZnTPP NSs, and the photoinduced electron transfer from ZnTPP to Cu2O can be identified via the path of ZnTPP&#8594; (ZnTPP&#8226;ZnTPP)*&#8594; ZnTPP-&#8594; Zn-O-Cu &#8594; Cu2O. Consequently, Cu2O@ZnTPP exhibits a shorter electron-hole separation lifetime (3.3 vs. 9.3 ps) and a longer recombination lifetime (23.1 vs. 13.4 ps) than individual ZnTPP NSs. This work provides a strategy to construct the organic nanostructures for photocatalytic CO2RR to multi-electron products.</description>

                Abstract Nowadays high&#8208;valent Cu species (i.e., Cu &#948;+ ) has been clarified to enhance multi&#8208;carbon production in electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). Nonetheless, the inconsistent average Cu valence states have been reported to significantly govern the product profile of CO 2 RR, which may lead to misunderstanding of the enhanced mechanism for multi&#8208;carbon production and results in an ambiguous roles of high&#8208;valent Cu species. Dynamic Cu &#948;+ during CO 2 RR leads to erratic valence states and challenges of high&#8208;valent species determination. Herein, we propose an alternative descriptor of (sub)surface oxygen, the (sub)surface&#8208;oxygenated degree (&#954;) to quantify the active high&#8208;valent Cu species on the (sub)surface, which regulates the multi&#8208;carbon production of CO 2 RR. The &#954; validates a strong correlation to the carbonyl (*CO) coupling efficiency and is the critical factor for the multi&#8208;carbon enhancement, in which an optimized Cu 2 O@Pd 2.31 achieves the multi&#8208;carbon partial current density of &#8764;330 mA cm &#8722;2 with a faradaic efficiency of 83.5%. This work shows a promising way to unveil the role of high&#8208;valent species and further achieve carbon neutralization. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved</description>

      <title>Interface engineering of Cu2O/In(OH)3 for efficient solar-driven CO2 electrochemical reduction to syngas</title>

                Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) holds greater promise for converting CO2 into value-added chemicals, but designing and manufacturing efficient CO2RR catalysts remains desirable but challenging. Here, the Cu2O/In(OH)3 with heterojunction structure was prepared as an efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts. The optimized Cu2O/In(OH)3&#8211;1:1 stabilizes over a wide range of potentials to generate syngas (hydrogen/carbon monoxide, H2/CO) at a ratio of 2:1, and the total Faraday efficiency (FE) remains close to 100 %. However, the ratio of syngas will change to 1:1 when the Cu/In ratio becomes 1:2. In addition, creatively using solar energy to drive the CO2RR system can directly and efficiently achieve the change of solar energy to chemical energy (syngas). Moreover, in-situ experiments show that part of Cu+ is converted to Cu during the CO2RR process, while In(OH)3 remains stable. This work highlights an efficient electrocatalyst for producing syngas based on interface engineering.</description>

      <title>CO2 Valorization in Deep Eutectic Solvents</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202400197</link>
      <description>Zhenbo Guo, Zhicheng Zhang, Yongmin Huang, Tie Lin, Yixin Guo, Ling He, Tianfei Liu, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394873313

                The deep eutectic solvent (DES) has emerged in recent years as a valuable medium for converting CO2 into valuable chemicals because of its easy availability, stability, and safety, and its capability to dissolve carbon dioxide. CO2 valorization in DES has evolved rapidly over the past 20 years. As well as being used as solvents for acid/base-promoted CO2 conversion for the production of cyclic carbonates and carbamates, DESs can be used as reaction media for electrochemical CO2 reduction for formic acid and CO. Among these products, cyclic carbonates can be used as solvents and electrolytes, carbamate derivatives include the core structure of many herbicides and pesticides, and formic acid and carbon monoxide, the C1 electrochemical products, are essential raw materials in the chemical industries. An overview of the application of DESs for CO2 valorization in recent years is presented in this review, followed by a compilation and comparison of product types and reaction mechanisms within the different types of DESs, and an outlook on how CO2 valorization will be developed in the future.</description>

                The possibility of conjugate electroreduction of carbon dioxide and hydrogen in the presence of 2,2'-bipyridine and its N -substituted salts in the presence of acids with different pKa values was studied. It was revealed how the strength of the acid affects the efficiency of the process; in particular, it was determined that the presence of methylsulfonic acid in the system promotes the conjugate formation of hydrogen and the reduction of carbon dioxide to formic acid. Probable mechanisms for the reactions occurring have been proposed.</description>

                The photocatalytic reduction reactions of CO2 in aqueous suspensions of titanium dioxide (TiO2) semiconductor with photodeposited Pt and Cu cocatalysts have been studied. It has been found that the composition and amount of CO2 reduction products significantly depend on the nature of the cocatalyst supported onto TiO2. A mechanism for the formation of CO2 reduction products has been proposed.</description>

      <title>Characteristics and Reduction of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emissions during the Construction of Urban Parks in South Korea</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16083405</link>
      <description>Changsong Oh, Sustainability. 16(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394914492

                The purpose of this study was to determine the carbon dioxide emissions produced by each type of landscape construction required for each urban park design theme in South Korea and mitigation measures. This study obtained data from four urban park construction projects in South Korea and calculated the amount of carbon dioxide generated during the construction phase using the Tier 2 method based on the amount of construction machinery used according to Korean construction standards. The results show that the three cases beginning after 2020 generated about 1.0 tCO2 of carbon dioxide per 100 m2. In each case, mechanized construction accounted for more than 60% of the total trees planted, and more than 50% of the carbon dioxide was generated in constructing forest-themed parks. Transplanting trees in their natural state emitted at least 2.5 times and up to 9.6 times more carbon dioxide than planting new trees. Pavement construction generated about 340 to 390 tCO2, and block pavement construction generated about 20 to 70 tCO2 per 100 m2 more than pavement constructed by the wet construction method. Based on these results, in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the first step should be to reduce the planting and transplanting of large trees, as this involves a high workload in terms of construction machinery at the design stage, and in the long term, it will be necessary to lead the &#8220;landscape of time&#8221; through the growth of plant materials. Second, the workload of construction machinery should be improved to induce carbon dioxide reductions through the revision of the Standard Unit Productivity Data on Construction Projects, and it is necessary to refer to past standards. Third, it may be desirable to use wet pavement, but there is a need to improve the sectional detail of block pavement to reduce mechanized work.</description>

      <title>High potential in synergizing the reduction of dissolved organic carbon concentration and carbon dioxide emissions for submerged-vegetation-covered river networks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2024.04.007</link>
      <description>Qingqian Li, Ruixia Liu, Zhangmu Jing, Yintao Wei, Sheng Tu, Han&#8208;Qing Yu, Hongjie Gao, Peng Yuan, Journal of Environmental Sciences/Journal of environmental sciences. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394858776

                Various technologies and projects have been explored and developed for the synergetic control of environmental pollution and carbon emissions in aquatic ecosystems. Planting submerged vegetation in shallow waters was also expected to achieve this purpose. However, the magnitude and mechanism of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission affected by submerged vegetation is not clear enough in complex aquatic ecosystems. This study investigated the influences of submerged plants on CO2 emission, ecosystem metabolism features, and microbial community traits based on observations in river networks on the Changjiang River Delta. The results showed that CO2 emission from planted waters accounted for 73% of unplanted waters. Meanwhile, planted waters had higher dissolved organic carbon removal capacity in overlying water and higher potential of carbon sequestration in sediment at the same time. These distinctions between the two habitats were attributed to (1) improved CO2 and bicarbonate consumption in water columns via enhancing photosynthesis and (2) inhibited CO2 production by reconstructing the benthic microbial community. Additional eco-advantages were found in planted sediments, such as a high potential of methane oxidation and xenobiotics biodegradation and a low risk of becoming black and odorous. In brief, submerged vegetation is beneficial in promoting pollution removal and carbon retention synchronously. This study advances our understanding of the feedback between aquatic metabolism and CO2 emission.</description>

                The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a sustainable route for converting CO2 into value&#8208;added fuels and feedstocks, advancing a carbon&#8208;neutral economy. The electrolyte critically influences CO2 utilization, reaction rate and product selectivity. While typically conducted in neutral/alkaline aqueous electrolytes, the CO2RR faces challenges due to (bi)carbonate formation and its crossover to the anolyte, reducing efficiency and stability. Acidic media offer promise by suppressing these processes, but the low Faradaic efficiency, especially for multicarbon (C2+) products, and poor electrocatalyst stability persist. The effective regulation of the reaction environment at the cathode is essential to favor the CO2RR over the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improve long&#8208;term stability. This review examines progress in the acidic CO2RR, focusing on reaction environment regulation strategies such as electrocatalyst design, electrode modification and electrolyte engineering to promote the CO2RR. Insights into the reaction mechanisms via in situ/operando techniques and theoretical calculations are discussed, along with critical challenges and future directions in acidic CO2RR technology, offering guidance for developing practical systems for the carbon&#8208;neutral community.</description>

In this study, we report ternary Zn-Ce-Ag catalysts for selective and stable CO2-to-CO conversion at high current densities on a large scale. We found that ZnO catalysts are relatively selective for CO2-to-CO conversion, but are only stable for less than 20 h at current densities over 100 mA cm&#8722;2 due to the reduction of the Zn oxide phase, along with the ECR. Combining ZnO with CeO2 significantly improves the stability of the catalysts, maintaining a CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 80 % for 100 h at the current density of 200 mA cm&#8722;2. By introducing a small amount of silver (&lt;10 wt%) to form ternary Ag-Ce-Zn catalysts, both CO selectivity and stability are significantly improved: the developed catalysts exhibit a high FECO of 90 % at 200 mA cm&#8722;2 and are stable for 200 h. We attribute the enhanced CO2-to-CO conversion efficiency to the abundance of stable interfacial areas of various metal-oxide interactions, which are critical for ECR. To demonstrate the potential for practical application, we performed the ECR in a large electrochemical cell, with an active surface area of 100 cm2. The system delivers a FECO of 90 % at 200 mA cm&#8722;2 for an extended operation time of 200 h.</description>

                Aprotic organic electrolytes for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) offer a promising yet little-explored alternative to avoid the selectivity issues of alkaline media. We present a model-assisted study of the local reaction environment at a Cu cathode in aprotic organic electrolytes to determine the kinetics of the CO2R and the kinetic limitations and reveal their dependence on reaction conditions. The adsorption of CO2 is identified as the rate-determining step, as opposed to the often-assumed electron transfer during radical anion formation. Unlike alkaline media, there is no transport limitation in aprotic media. Furthermore, our model predicts two strategies to overcome the adsorption limitation: (i) by increasing surface roughness and (ii) by elevating pressure. The findings highlight the critical role of CO2 adsorption on CO2R performance and enable knowledge-driven optimization of reaction conditions and electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract The climate disasters caused by extreme climate change have brought great harm to humanity. This article attempts to propose a balanced CO2 emission perspective by constructing a CO2 emission reduction tolerance function and cost function. Using China's CO2 emission data of China's Oil and Gas Industry over the past 20 years, data on the losses caused by CO2 emission accumulation to the environment and society, and national income data, empirical analysis is conducted on the constructed function to determine a reasonable CO2 emission amount and provide a scientific basis for the country to formulate a scientific and reasonable CO2 emission reduction ratio.</description>

                In Japan, efforts have been made to reduce CO2 emissions by utilizing recycled parts of automobiles for more than 10 years, and an annual amount of reduction in CO2 emission of approximately 130,000&#8211;140,000 tons per year has been estimated. This initiative has received a great deal of attention globally in the field of automobile recycling; however, we need to examine whether the strategy of utilizing recycled auto parts for CO2 emission reduction can be applied overseas. In China, which has the largest number of vehicles in the world, the effect of reducing CO2 emissions through the use of used automobile parts has not been investigated. However, based on the number of payments for non-life insurance accidents in China, we estimated the potential for reducing CO2 emissions through the use of used automobile parts based on the number of traffic accidents in China, using current data from Japan, and obtained the result of 5952 t-CO2/Y on average over 5 years. In addition, we collected information on the current situation of automobile recycling, administrative efforts, and policies and conducted a fact-finding survey and analysis of specific methods and issues regarding the introduction of Japanese-style CO2 emission reduction programs in China.</description>

                Transforming carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable chemical products or carbonaceous fuels is a crucial strategy for addressing the impact of global climate change and energy challenges. Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) shows promise in this regard, but challenges remain in the eCO2RR, such as poor electrocatalytic activity and low selectivity of the target product. In this study, we report a one&#8208;step method of replacement reaction for synthesizing a cadmium layer on the zinc foil surface (named as the Cd/Zn electrode) for efficient eCO2RR to CO. The thicknesses of Cd layers could be easily adjusted by varying the molar concentration of Cd2+. The Cd/Zn electrode with a 2.0 &#181;m thick Cd layer exhibited superior electrocatalytic performance of the eCO2RR to CO in the ionic liquid&#8208;containing electrolytes. The highest Faradaic efficiency of CO reached up to 99.0% at &#8208;1.9 V vs. Ag/Ag+, and the maximum CO partial current density achieved 34.8 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8208;2.3 V vs. Ag/Ag+. The 3D fluffy Cd layer with a suitable thickness on the Zn foil surface provided abundant active sites, fast charge transfer rate, and strong adsorption ability of CO2&#8226;&#8722; intermediates, which contributed to the enhancement of the electrocatalytic performance of the eCO2RR to CO.</description>

      <title>Low-carbon Fuel Reburning for CO2 and NOx Reduction in Pulverized Coal Firing System</title>

                or zero-carbon fuels is necessary to reduce CO2 emissions. Gas reburning technology can be applied to existing coal boilers to reduce not only CO2 but also NOx emissions. In this study, we confirmed the gas reburning effect using lab-scale equipment based on the consumption coal used in real-scale boilers, with the aim of practical application. Bituminous coal was used as the reference fuel, and sub-bituminous coal was blended to determine whether coal blending has an effect on NOx emissions. This was conducted to optimize the coal blending ratio and gas reburning technology for NOx emission reduction and quantify the NOx reduction by the two methods. Blending sub-bituminous coal reduced the unburned carbon (UBC) content, because of its high volatile matter content. Moreover, NOx emissions decreased as the ratio of sub-bituminous coal increased. In terms of the reburning effect, although UBCs increased with the addition of methane, NOx emission decreased by up to 96.05%. The conversion ratio, defined as the NOx formation ratio of the total fuel N injection, was used to separate the NOx reduction effects of the two methods. Thus, gas reburning in the ammonia co-firing system of coal-fired power plants can significantly reduce NOx emissions.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-monovacancy (VN) Hexagonal Boron Nitride 2D Monolayer Material
  as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for CO2 Reduction Reaction</title>

                The conversion of waste carbon dioxide (CO2) gas into valuable products and fuels through an electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising approach. The sluggish kinetics of the CO2RR require the development of novel strategies for electrocatalyst design. Two-dimensional (2D) materials emerge as promising candidates for CO2RR due to their distinctive electronic and structural properties. This study follows the first principles based DFT-D method to examine the electrocatalytic competences of the defective two-dimensional boron nitride monolayer (d-BN) material towards CO2RR. Introducing a particular defect with nitrogen vacancies in the 2D single layer pristine hexagonal boron nitride (VN_d-BN) can efficiently activate the CO2 molecules for hydrogenation by reducing the electronic band gap of the pristine hBN from 6.23 eV to 3.0 eV. Therefore, VN_d-BN material can act as a large band gap semiconductor. Our findings demonstrate that the defective regions in the 2D monolayer VN_d-BN serve as active sites (Boron) for both the adsorption and activation of CO2. The subsequent hydrogenation steps occur sequentially once the CO2 molecule is adsorbed on the catalytic surface. Our results indicate that the OCHO* path is the most favorable for CH4 production. Hence, the 2D monolayer VN_d-BN material holds a great promise as a cost-effective catalyst for CO2RR, and it presents a viable alternative to expensive platinum (Pt) catalysts.</description>

                A study is performed of the electrocatalytic activity of substituted pyridine salts (N-hydro-, N&#8209;methyl-, and N-phenyl-2,4,6-triphenylpyridinium perchlorates) in the electroreduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. The effect the natures of the substituent and the H+ source have on the efficiency of the process is determined. The main reasons for the occurrence of the electrocatalytic process are identified, and the values of TOF (catalyst speed) and TON (number of revolutions of the catalyst) are calculated. It is shown that the values of TOF and TON fall as the pK of the acid rises.</description>

      <title>Efficient Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction over Cu-decorated
  Biphenylene</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2404.10409</link>
      <description>Radha N Somaiya, Muhammad Sajjad, Nirpendra Singh, Aftab Alam, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394946858

                Developing efficient electrocatalysts for CO$_2$ reduction into value-added products is crucial for the green economy. Inspired by the recent synthesis of Biphenylene (BPH), we have systematically investigated pristine, defective, and Cu-decorated BPH as an electrocatalyst for the CO$_2$ reduction reactions (CRR). Our first-principles calculations show the CO$_2$ molecules weakly interact with the pristine BPH surface while defective BPH facilitates the CO$_2$ adsorption with a binding energy ($E_b$) of -3.22 eV, indicating the detrimental process for the CRR on the surface of both systems. Furthermore, we have investigated the binding energy and kinetic stability of Cu-decorated BPH as a single-atom-catalyst (SAC). The molecular dynamics simulations confirm the kinetic stability, revealing that the Cu-atom avoids agglomeration under low metal dispersal conditions. The CO$_2$ molecule gets adsorbed horizontally on the Cu-BPH surface with $E_b$ of -0.52 eV. The CRR mechanism is investigated using two pathways beginning with two different initial intermediate states, formate ($\mathrm{^*OCOH}$) and the carboxylic ($\mathrm{^*COOH}$) pathways. The formate pathway confirms the conversion of $\mathrm{^*OCOH}$ to $\mathrm{^*HCOOH}$ with the rate-limiting potential ($U_L$) of 0.57 eV for the production of HCOOH, while for the carboxylic pathway, the conversion of $\mathrm{^*COH}$ to $\mathrm{^*CHOH}$ has $U_L$ of 0.49 eV for the production of CH$_3$OH. We have also investigated the effect of protons using charged hydrogen pseudopotential, which hints towards the possible formation of CH$_3$OH as fuel. Our findings propose Cu-BPH as an efficient single-atom catalyst for CO$_2$ conversion compared to the well-known Cu metal.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Microenvironment of Co&#8208;N4 in Co Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>

                Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), with their well&#8208;defined structure, serve as an efficient catalyst model for studying the structure&#8208;performance relation in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Current CO2RR research primarily focus on the coordination interactions between metal single atoms and coordinated ligands, while the impact of the metal SAC's microenvironment remains largely unexplored. Herein, we generate three microenvironments for a CoN4 ensemble by using different nitrogen sources to prepare Co SACs, i.e. pyridine&#8208;type Co&#8208;N4 (Co&#8208;N4 SACPhen), the pyrrole&#8208;type Co&#8208;N4 (Co&#8208;N4 SACDp) and the mixed&#8208;type Co&#8208;N4(Co&#8208;N4 SACMm). It reveals that the Co&#8208;N4 SACPhen contributes to CO generation with 99.5% selectivity at &#8208;0.76 vs RHE, whereas the Co&#8208;N4 SACDp accelerates a severe hydrogen evolution reaction. Experimental studies confirmed that the Co&#8208;N4 SACPhen possesses distinctive electrochemical properties and electronic structure, facilitating the generation of CO. This study deepens our understanding of the cobalt SAC's microenvironment's influence on CO2RR.</description>

                Converting CO2 and water into valuable chemicals like plant do is considered a promising approach to address both environmental and energy issues. Taking inspiration from the structures of natural leaves, we designed and synthesized a novel copper-coordinated covalent triazine framework (CuCTF) supported by silicon nanowire arrays on wafer chip. This marks the first-ever application of such a hybrid material in the photoelectrocatalytic reduction of CO2 under mild conditions. The Si@CuCTF6 heterojunction has exhibited exceptional selectivity of 95.6% towards multicarbon products (C2+) and apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 0.89% for carbon-based products. The active sites of the catalysts are derived from the nitrogen atoms of unique triazine ring structure in the ordered porous framework and the abundant Cu&#8722;N coordination sites with bipyridine units. Furthermore, through DFT calculations and operando FTIR spectra analysis, we proposed a comprehensive mechanism for the photoelectrocatalytic CO2 reduction, confirming the existence of key intermediate species such as *CO2&#8722;, *=C=O, *CHO and *CO&#8722;CHO etc. This work not only provides a new way to mimic photosynthesis of plant leaves but also gives a new opportunity to enter this research field in the future.</description>

      <title>Influence of Zn species in MWW zeolite on the ethane dehydroaromatization with the assistance of propane co-dehydroaromatization and CO2 reduction</title>

                The Zn-containing HMCM-22 samples with different zinc species were prepared and characterized to discriminate the influence of zinc species on the ethane activation by the initial C-H bond cleavage or the &#946;-H cleavage dehydrogenation step of alkyl zinc species (Zn-C2H5) through the propane co-dehydroaromatization and CO2 reduction process. The synergistic effect of zinc species types with the Br&#248;nsted acid sites (BAS) of the parent zeolite HMCM-22 had a significant effect on the ethane dehydroaromatization. The synergistic effect between ZnO species and BAS had better ethane conversion and aromatic selectivity in ethane dehydrogenation, while the poor synergistic effect between ZnOH+ species and BAS was not conducive to the formation of aromatic, and ZnOH+ species was more conducive to ethane dehydrogenation. The ZnOH+ has better catalytic performance in CO2 activated ethane and promote the &#946;-H desorption of Zn-C2H5 in ethane dehydrogenation. The synergetic effect of ZnO species and BAS in the zeolite facilitates the hydride transfer activation of ethane by propylene carbenium ions thus enhancing the ethane conversion through ethane-propane co-aromatization.</description>

                This paper presents an experimental study of using a double-layered Cu/TiO2 and P4O10/TiO2 as photocatalysts for CO2 reduction with an extended wavelength of range light from ultraviolet light (UV) to infrared light (IR). The lights studied were UV + visible light (VIS) + IR, VIS + IR and IR only. This study also investigated the impact of the molar ratio of CO2:H2O on the CO2 reduction performance. This study revealed that the optimum molar ratio of CO2:H2O to produce CO was 1:1, irrespective of light illumination condition, which matched the theoretical molar ratio to produce CO according to the reaction scheme of CO2 reduction with H2O. Comparing the results of double-layered Cu/TiO2 and P4O10/TiO2 with those of double-layered TiO2 obtained under the UV + VIS + IR light illumination condition, the highest concentration of formed CO and the molar quantity of formed CO per unit weight of the photocatalyst increased by 281 ppmV and 0.8 &#956;mol/g, in the case of the molar ratio of CO2:H2O = 1:1. With IR-only illumination, the highest concentration of formed CO and the molar quantity of CO formed per unit weight of the photocatalyst was 251 ppmV and 4.7 &#956;mol/g, respectively.</description>

                The CO2 electrochemical reduction process has been executed utilizing a solid oxide electrolysis cell, incorporating advanced cathode materials: A-site deficient calcium-doped lanthanum strontium titanate (La0.2Sr0.25Ca0.45TiO3-&#948;, LSCT) and cerium (5 mol%)-doped lanthanum strontium calcium titanate (Ce0.05La0.2Sr0.2Ca0.45TiO3-&#948;, Ce-LSCT). In both electrochemical setups, La0.8Sr0.2MnO3-&#948; (LSM) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) were employed as the anode and electrolyte, respectively. The electrocatalytic efficacy of LSCT was notably enhanced in a hydrogen-rich environment, evidenced by a reduction in cathode polarization resistance from 36.7 to 10.43 &#937;.cm2, concurrent with an increase in H2 concentration from 30 % to 50 %. Additionally, the replacement of 5 mol% strontium with cerium in the LSCT cathode composition resulted in a further decrease of polarization resistance to 4.88 &#937;.cm2 at a CO2/H2 molar ratio of 50/50. In a reductive atmosphere, Ceria (CeO2) nanospheres were observed to exsolve from their lattice sites within the Ce-LSCT cathode, as verified through FE-SEM and HR-TEM analyses. These in-situ exsolved CeO2 nanoparticles actively contributed to the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, achieving a superior current density of 1.01 A/cm2, surpassing the 0.69 A/cm2 recorded for the LSCT cathode. This was observed at an operational voltage of 2.5 V and a temperature of 800 &#176;C. These outcomes suggest the potential of LSCT as a cathode material in CO2 reduction reactions, with Ce-doping offering a pathway to further augment its electrocatalytic capabilities.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Activity and Selectivity Challenges for CO2 Reduction via Transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free Homo&#8208; and Hetero&#8208;biatomic Catalysts Embedded in Two&#8208;dimensional Networks</title>

                Synergistic interactions between the atoms in double atom catalysts has emerged as a promising tool to tune and boost CO2 activation and reduction. In this work, we systematically designed highly stable transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;biatomic catalysts based on Al, Be, B and Si supported on TCNQ monolayer for CO2 reduction to C1 products using dispersion corrected periodic density functional theory calculations. Our findings reveal that transition&#8208;metal&#8208;free homo&#8208;and hetero&#8208;biatomic TCNQ catalysts can effectively capture and activate the CO2 molecule with binding energies ranging from 0.09 to 2.35 eV. Extensive free energy calculations to screen the favourable reaction pathways to different C1 products (CO, HCOOH, CH3OH and CH4) demonstrate that Al2&#8208;TCNQ, AlBe&#8208;TCNQ and BeSi&#8208;TCNQ stand out as potential candidates for catalyzing CO2RR to methanol in a selective manner, suppressing the competitive HER simultaneously. Remarkably, BeSi&#8208;TCNQ shows the best catalytic activity towards CO2 reduction to methanol at record low limiting potential of &#8208;0.29 V with spontaneous desorption of the final product. From the in&#8208;depth examination of the electronic structure details, integrated projected density of states and crystal orbital Hamilton populations are used to understand and rationalize the binding interactions between the adsorbed CO2 molecule and the homo&#8208; or hetero&#8208;biatomic TCNQ catalysts.</description>

                Objectives/Scope In light of the global transition towards the 1.5-degree pathway, the need for alternative power sources becomes increasingly crucial. However, the rapid growth in the number of wells has led to a substantial rise in power consumption. Currently, ESP systems account for a significant portion, approximately 19%, of the company's power consumption, with an upward trend. To address this challenge, this study aims to employ data analytics and Six Sigma tools to identify and implement methods for optimizing power consumption and enhancing energy efficiency within ESP systems. Methods, Procedures, Process The study commenced by gathering data for approximately 20 ESP parameters along with corresponding power consumption readings from a comprehensive sample of 250 wells. The data underwent meticulous verification and validation processes, ensuring technical and analytical accuracy. To gain insights into the relationship between power consumption and ESP parameters, graphical tools were employed for in-depth analysis. The analysis revealed two primary parameters that consistently contributed to higher power consumption in ESP systems when compared to their design specifications. The team then embarked on developing models aimed at concurrently reducing these identified parameters, namely voltage and tubing head pressure, without compromising production levels. The models demonstrated a promising reduction in power consumption, ranging from 8% to 24%, based on a sample of wells. Subsequently, the team implemented the identified optimizations on the selected wells, which resulted in tangible reductions in power consumption. Encouraged by these positive outcomes, the exercise was replicated across other wells within the field, yielding significant improvements in energy efficiency. Results, Observations, Conclusions The impact of the power consumption optimization measures implemented across the entire company's ESP systems, encompassing approximately 1,000 units equipped with variable speed drives, has yielded remarkable results. Calculations based on electricity tariffs indicate an annual cost savings of $3.0 million. This substantial reduction in operational expenses not only enhances the financial performance of the company but also reinforces its commitment to sustainability. In terms of environmental impact, the power reduction initiatives have led to a significant reduction of approximately 5,500 tons of CO2 emissions annually. The successful implementation of optimizations yielded significant financial savings and environmental benefits. This study establishes a foundation for future energy management strategies, emphasizing the potential for widespread adoption in the oil industry. Novel/Additive Information The study's noteworthy aspect is the successful integration of Six Sigma tools and data analytics, providing a structured framework for optimizing ESP systems. This approach enhanced clarity and direction, making the comprehensive analysis of parameters manageable. Critical factors influencing power consumption were identified, leading to accurate models and significant energy savings. The synergy between data analytics and Six Sigma showcases a novel and additive approach for optimizing energy management in ESP systems, with potential for broader application in complex systems across industries.</description>

                In this study, the environmental improvement effectiveness of CCU(Carbon capture &amp; utilization) technology is analyzed, based on LCA(Life cycle assessment) methodology. Target CCU technology is synthesis process which uses carbon dioxide as raw material and produces useful materials such as DMC(Dimethyl carbonate), methanol and etc. As a result of LCA performed, 25 g CO2 eq. of greenhouse gases is reduced during life cycle for treating 1 kg of carbon dioxide. Therefore, target CCU technology produces an effect on greenhouse gas reduction. And electricity consumption of synthesis process is the main issue of GWP results. The improvement of energy type of synthesis process is effective for GWP. 746 g CO2 eq. of greenhouse gases is reduced by changing energy type of synthesis process. As a result, life cycle GWP reduction is obtained. The scenario analysis about carbon dioxide transportation distance is performed. In case of the distance of carbon dioxide transportation is farther than 97.13 km, the amount of greenhouse gas emission during life cycle is larger than avoid and target CCU technology is ineffective for greenhouse gas reduction. Consequentially, target CCU technology is effective for greenhouse gas reduction. And the region for installing the process should consider the distance of carbon dioxide transportation.</description>

      <description>Isa S. Qamber, No host. None(None)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4394803603

                The escalating production of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) from electricity power stations, primarily attributed to the burning of fossil fuels, stands as a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions. This study delves into the intricate relationship between CO2 emissions, installed capacity of power stations, and the energy generated by these facilities. By developing a power generation model based on CO2 emissions, this research aims to project present and future emissions against the backdrop of increasing energy demands. Smart city construction emerges as a key mitigating factor in the reduction of CO2 emissions, showcasing a notable impact on the overall carbon footprint. The study explores the correlation between the construction of smart cities and the reduction of CO2 emissions, emphasizing the role of new infrastructure in fostering a low-carbon economy. The modelling outputs provide insights into the current state of CO2 emissions from power stations and offer estimations for future scenarios. Special emphasis is placed on thermal energy, evaluating its potential contribution to meeting CO2 reduction targets. The study also investigates the intricate web of factors influencing CO2 emissions, including gases from fossil fuel combustion and those generated during the cement manufacturing process.</description>

      <title>A study on development of CCS(Carbon Capture and Storage) life cycle impact assessment methods considering the ecotoxicity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.62765/kjlca.2014.15.1.15</link>
      <description>Kihak Park, Hyunchul Kang, Korean Journal of Life Cycle Assessment. 15(1)] 2014. https://openalex.org/W4394832595

                Carbon capture and storage(CCS) is a technique that aims to capture carbon dioxide(C02) from emissions and store it somewhere, thus it attracts public attention as a reduction method of the greenhouse gases(GHGs). To achieve GHGs reduction goal complying with 2005 level by 2050&#65292;internationally it is forecasted that CCS will reduce 19% of total greenhouse gas. Also, South Korea has a plan to reduce 32 million tons of CO2 emission, which is 10% of total national GHGs, by using CCS techniques by 2030. There many technical efforts and researches for CCS system for GHGs reduction, however, there has been little study on ecological and environmental impact assessment and research for CCS system. The CO2 storage at underground and deep saline aquifer can contribute for GHGs emission reduction, however, the CO2 leak from storage can affect ecological system and this cause other serious problems. Also we cannot expect its impacts. Therefore, in this study, we suggested a life cycle impact assessment method, which can be applied to the CCS system, as not a global warming emission but an ecotoxicity factor for CO2 emission. When CO2 emission is considering as an ecotoxicity emission, first we can identify the quantity and concentration of CO2, and then it can be translated to l,4-dichlorobenzene(DCB) equivalent value, which is ecotoxicity characterization factor. This life cycle impact assessment method can be applied to CCS system effectively. By using this suggested life cycle impact assessment method in this study, we can interpret in terms of global warming and ecotoxicity aspects and it will contribute for safe CCS technology development.</description>

                Iron- and Cu&#8211;Zn-containing carbon dioxide hydrogenation catalysts based on natural aluminosilicate nanotubes and zeolite H-ZSM-5 are synthesized. Their textural and acidic properties are studied via low-temperature nitrogen adsorption&#8211;desorption, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen, and elemental analysis. The effect the temperatures of the reaction have on the conversion of CO2 and distribution of its product is studied. Catalysts based on aluminosilicate halloysite nanotubes exhibit methanol and &#1057;2&#8211;&#1057;4 hydrocarbon selectivities of 88 and 16%, respectively.</description>

                On the way to climate neutrality manufacturing companies need to assess the Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of their products as a basis for emission reduction measures. The evaluate this so-called Product Carbon Footprint (PCF) life cycle analysis as a comprehensive method is applicable, but means great effort and requires interdisciplinary knowledge. Nevertheless, assumptions must still be made to assess the entire supply chain. To lower these burdens and provide a digital tool to estimate the PCF with less input parameter and data, we make use of machine learning techniques and develop an editorial framework called MINDFUL. This contribution shows its realization by providing the software architecture, underlying CO2 factors, calculations and Machine Learning approach as well as the principles of its user experience. Our tool is validated within an industrial case study.</description>

                The excessive consumption of fossil fuels increases CO2 emissions, and the consequent greenhouse effect resulting from higher levels of this gas in the atmosphere has a significant impact on the environment and climate. This has necessitated the development of environmentally friendly and efficient methods for CO2 conversion. The carbon dioxide electroreduction reaction (CO2RR), which is driven by electricity generated by renewable energy sources (e.g., wind and solar) to convert CO2 into value-added fuels or chemicals, is regarded as a promising prospective path toward carbon cycling. Among the various products, formate, with its relatively simple preparation process, has broad application prospects, and can be used as fuel, hydrogen storage material, and raw material for downstream chemicals. Sn-based oxide electrocatalysts have the advantages of being inexpensive and nontoxic. In addition, these catalysts offer high product selectivity and are regarded as promising catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate. In this review, we first clarify the reaction mechanisms and factors that influence the reduction of CO2 to formate, and then provide some examples of technologies that could be used to study the evolution of catalysts during the reaction. In particular, we focus on traditional Sn-based oxides (SnO2) and novel Sn-based perovskite oxides that have been developed for use in the field of CO2RR in recent years by considering their synthesis, catalytic performance, optimization strategies, and intrinsic principles. Finally, the current challenges and opportunities for Sn-based oxide electrocatalysts are discussed. The perspectives and latest trends presented in this review are expected to inspire researchers to contribute more efforts toward comprehensively optimizing the performance of the CO2RR to produce formate.</description>

      <title>Tuning the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction Selectivity of an Immobilized Molecular Ag Complex beyond CO</title>

                The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce fuels and chemicals has garnered significant attention. However, achieving control over the selectivity of the resulting products remains a challenging task, particularly within molecular systems. In this study, we employed a molecular silver complex immobilized on graphitized mesoporous carbon (GMC) as a catalyst for converting CO2 into CO, achieving an impressive selectivity of over 90% at -1.05 V vs RHE. Notably, the newly formed silver nanoparticles emerged as the active sites responsible for this high CO selectivity rather than the molecular system. Intriguingly, the introduction of copper ions into the restructured Ag-nanoparticle-decorated carbon altered the product selectivity. At -1.1 V vs RHE in 0.1 M KCl, we achieved a high C2 selectivity of 75%. Furthermore, not only the Ag-Cu bimetallic nanoparticle but also the small-sized Ag-Cu nanocluster decorated over GMC was proposed as active sites during catalytic reactions. Our straightforward approach offers valuable insights for fine-tuning the product selectivity of immobilized molecular systems, extending beyond C1 products.</description>

                Adsorption-based capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) to upgrade natural gas offer a promising solution for energy crisis and the reduction of CO2 emission. However, trade-off between high adsorption selectivity and rapid kinetic is an inherent shortcoming of size-sieving based adsorptive separation of gas molecules at similar sizes, hindering the launch of sieving adsorbent for practical challenging selective gas capture. Herein, a gradiently porous carbon nanofiber PCF-800 with interconnected sieving ultramicropores and low-proportion surficial mesopores is tailor-made to simultaneously realize the exclusive and rapid capture of CO2 from CH4. Arising from the unique interconnected micro-mesoporous structure, the as-prepared PCF-800 not only achieves remarkable uptake ratio of 45 (298 K, 1 bar) for CO2/CH4 separation via size-sieving effect but also shows fast kinetic with diffusion rate of 1.35 &#215; 10-3 s&#8722;1, outperforming the conventional ultramicroporous counterpart. Moreover, the impressive dynamic CO2/CH4 separation factor up to 21.7 and satisfying cycling durability revealed by the breakthrough experiments further imply the industrial potential of PCF-800 in practical CH4 purification. This work may shed light on the design of gradient sieving carbonaceous adsorbent with high selectivity and fast kinetic for extensive high-performance small gas separation.</description>

                The concurrent utilization of an adsorbent and absorbent for carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorption with synergistic effects presents a promising technique for CO2 capture. Here, 1-butyl-3-methylimidazole acetate ([Bmim][Ac]), with a high affinity for CO2, and the molecular sieve SAPO-34 were selected. The impregnation method was used to composite the hybrid samples of [Bmim][Ac]/SAPO-34, and the pore structure and surface property of prepared samples were characterized. The quantity and kinetics of the sorbed CO2 for loaded samples were measured using thermogravimetric analysis. The study revealed that SAPO-34 could retain its pristine structure after [Bmim][Ac] loading. The CO2 uptake of the loaded sample was 1.879 mmol g-1 at 303 K and 1 bar, exhibiting a 20.6% rise compared to that of the pristine SAPO-34 recording 1.558 mmol g-1. The CO2 uptake kinetics of the loaded samples were also accelerated, and the apparent mass transfer resistance for CO2 sorption was significantly reduced by 11.2% compared with that of the pure [Bmim][Ac]. The differential scanning calorimetry method revealed that the loaded sample had a lower CO2 desorption heat than that of the pure [Bmim][Ac], and the CO2 desorption heat of the loaded samples was between 30.6 and 40.8 kJ mol-1. The samples exhibited good cyclic stability. This material displays great potential for CO2 capture applications, facilitating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</description>

                Outcrops of the Oligocene-Pliocene coal-bearing Tankhoi suite are traced along the southern shore of Lake Baikal and submerge under its Southern Basin, in which several hydrate-bearing zones of focused discharge of hydrocarbon fluids have been found. To test the hypothesis that coals of the Tankhoi Suite can be sources of hydrocarbon gases in these zones, we collected coal samples from the Shakhterskaya Gorka outcrop. The experiment on gas generation from the selected samples was carried out in a special autoclave at a temperature of 90&#176;C for eight months. This paper presents the results of this study, which confirm the important role of gas generation processes from coals in the formation of fluids in the Kedr mud volcano. Further migration of gases was accompanied by biodegradation and the formation of secondary microbial methane due to CO2 reduction. This was one of the reasons for the observed carbon isotopic pattern in methane (heavier than &#8210;50&#8240; VPDB) and carbon dioxide (positive values) taken from near-surface sediments and hydrates of the Kedr mud volcano, as well as for the significant enrichment of authigenic siderites in the heavy 13C isotope.</description>

      <title>Long-term conservation tillage increase cotton rhizosphere sequestration of soil organic carbon by changing specific microbial CO2 fixation pathways in coastal saline soil</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120743</link>
      <description>Xunya Su, Le Zhang, Hua Meng, Han Wang, Jun Zhao, Xiulan Sun, Xianliang Song, Xiaopei Zhang, Lili Mao, Journal of environmental management. 358(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394836053

                Coastal saline soil is an important reserve resource for arable land globally. Data from 10 years of continuous stubble return and subsoiling experiments have revealed that these two conservation tillage measures significantly improve cotton rhizosphere soil organic carbon sequestration in coastal saline soil. However, the contribution of microbial fixation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has remained unclear. Here, metagenomics and metabolomics analyses were used to deeply explore the microbial CO2 fixation process in rhizosphere soil of coastal saline cotton fields under long-term stubble return and subsoiling. Metagenomics analysis showed that stubble return and subsoiling mainly optimized CO2 fixing microorganism (CFM) communities by increasing the abundance of Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Chloroflexi, and improving composition diversity. Conjoint metagenomics and metabolomics analyses investigated the effects of stubble return and subsoiling on the reverse tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle. The conversion of citrate to oxaloacetate was inhibited in the citrate cleavage reaction of the rTCA cycle. More citrate was converted to acetyl-CoA, which enhanced the subsequent CO2 fixation process of acetyl-CoA conversion to pyruvate. In the rTCA cycle reductive carboxylation reaction from 2-oxoglutarate to isocitrate, synthesis of the oxalosuccinate intermediate product was inhibited, with strengthened CO2 fixation involving the direct conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to isocitrate. The collective results demonstrate that stubble return and subsoiling optimizes rhizosphere CFM communities by increasing microbial diversity, in turn increasing CO2 fixation by enhancing the utilization of rTCA and 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycles by CFMs. These events increase the microbial CO2 fixation in the cotton rhizosphere, thereby promoting the accumulation of microbial biomass, and ultimately improving rhizosphere soil organic carbon. This study clarifies the impact of conservation tillage measures on microbial CO2 fixation in cotton rhizosphere of coastal saline soil, and provides fundamental data for the improvement of carbon sequestration in saline soil in agricultural ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Tuning CO2 electroreduction by facet-dependent metal-support interaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.124049</link>

                Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) helps to build a sustainable carbon cycle system. The selectivity and stability of CO2RR catalysts can be tuned by manipulating Metal-Support Interaction (MSI). Here, we conducted a theoretical and experimental research on the interaction between Ag nanoparticles and diverse crystal faces of Cu2O. It was found the strong electron transfer from Ag to (100) facet of hexahedral Cu2O enabled the formation of charge-redistributed interface with positively charged Ag and negatively charged Cu2O, which was more favorable to the stability of integrated structure and CO2-to-CO catalytic process compared to Ag-decorated octahedral and dodecahedral Cu2O with exposed (111) and (110) facets, respectively. Consequently, the composite of Ag on hexahedral Cu2O exhibited an impressive CO Faradaic efficiency of 93%, surpassing Ag on octahedral and dodecahedral Cu2O as well as individual Ag and Cu2O nanoparticles. This work provides an effective avenue to tune CO2RR process by interface engineering.</description>

                This study aims at life cycle assessment on valuable sorting/recovery from small household appliances was carried out. The recycling process mainly consists of 1st-stage crushing, manual dismantling, magnetic separation, 2nd-stage crushing and wet gravity separation process. This process is designed to process about 8 tons of used small household appliances per day, but it processes 800 kg per day for efficient sorting/recovery of the downstream wet gravity separation process. GWP was estimated to be about 9.24E+02 kg CO2-eq./f.u when each valuable resource was sorting/recovered from 1 tonne used small appliances. The environmental impacts on GWP among the environmental impact categories for sorting/recovery by valuable resources were about 65.7 % for PS/ABS 6.07E+02 kg CO2-eq., about 29.0 % for PP 2.68E+02 kg CO2-eq., about 2.9 % for ferrous metals 2.72E+01 kg CO2-eq., and 2.22E+01 kg CO2-eq. for copper And about 2.4 %. The effects of environmental and economic benefits are analyzed compared to the amount of virgin material recycled as recycled material, and the environmental impacts of 1.93E+03 kg CO2 yield were analyzed. If it translates into carbon emissions reduction, it will result in an economic impact of about 5,777 thousand won per year. In addition, environmental avoidance effects were analyzed to reduce carbon dioxide levels of about 237.8 tons per year. Recycling process including gravity separation techniques used in recycling process, which is used in the recycling companies, the environmental avoidance effect on the sorting/recovery of the final valuable resources is inefficient. In addition, when the wet gravity separation system for sorting plastics is applied, it is analyzed that the environmental load is caused by the use of the water and the treatment of the generated wastewater. It is urgently required to develop a crushing, disassembling technique and sorting technology in order to efficiently sorting and recover the valuable resources generated in the recycling process of used small household appliances made of various constituent materials.</description>

                Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce ethylene (C2H4) is conducive to sustainable development of energy and environment. At present, most electrocatalysts for C2H4 production are limited to the heavy metal copper, meanwhile, achieving metal&#8208;free catalysis remains a challenge. Noted piperazine with sp3 N hybridization is beneficial to CO2 capture, but CO2RR performance and mechanism have been lacking. Herein, based on linkage engineering, we construct a novel high&#8208;density sp3 N catalytic array via introducing piperazine into the crystalline and microporous aminal&#8208;linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs). Thanks to its high sp3 N density, strong CO2 capture capacity and great hydrophilicity, aminal&#8208;linked COF successfully achieves the conversion of CO2 to C2H4 with a Faraday efficiency up to 19.1%, which is stand out in all reported metal&#8208;free COF electrocatalysts. In addition, a series of imine&#8208;linked COFs are synthesized and combined with DFT calculations to demonstrate the critical role of sp3 N in enhancing the kinetics of CO2RR. Therefore, this work reveals the extraordinary potential of linkage engineering in COFs to break through some catalytic bottlenecks.</description>

                Decomposition of solid waste in landfills causes global air pollution with methane, the most dangerous of the greenhouse gases. The emission potential of this gas is 28-36 times greater than that of CO2. With the help of methane-reducing Biocover, can find a solution to this problem. In this study, a biocover was developed in the laboratory to reduce methane emissions. When measuring the methane emissions of this biocover, data on the amount of carbon dioxide emissions were also obtained in parallel. The purpose of this study is to clarify the interaction between methane emission reduction and carbon dioxide emission flux. The laboratory experiment consisted of three parts. The first part was the creation of experimental tubes. Three experimental columns with a diameter of 160 mm and a height of 1500 mm were created. Active compost saturated with water at a thickness of 500 mm was used as a source of methane, a permeable layer of sand at a thickness of 300 mm was further formed and finally covered with biocover. Biocover represents 60% of fine-fraction waste, 20% of soil and 20% of compost. The second part was taking measurements. All measurements were performed with the Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy (CRDS) gas measurement device Picarro G2508. The third part was the analysis of the obtained data. The obtained data were analyzed by processing the data and obtaining the interaction between these gases. The experiment is planned to be continued by obtaining long-term emission data. This will help to develop more promising future approaches to reduce methane emissions from landfills. This research contributes to the understanding of sustainable environmental management practices and underscores the importance of a holistic approach to address multiple greenhouse gases simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Amine emissions and CO2 purity from carbon capture pilot plant at the &#321;aziska coal-fired power plant</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2024.104132</link>

                Carbon dioxide reduction by amine absorption is considered the most technologically advanced method. This method is particularly recommended for gases with low CO2 concentrations, such as flue gases. On the other hand, the use of amine absorption solutions can contribute to the emission of harmful chemicals into the atmosphere. This paper presents the emission of amines and their degradation products from a CO2 capture pilot plant treating a slipstream (approximately 200 m3N/h) of flue gas from a pulverized coal-fired boiler. The studies were conducted during a 2-week research campaign at the &#321;aziska Power Plant in Poland. An aqueous blend of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (25 % AMP) with piperazine (9 % PZ) was used as the absorption liquid. Among others, ammonia (12 ppmv), acetone (1 ppmv) and AMP (20 ppmv) were found to be the main contaminants in the clean gas (from the absorber). However, it should be noted that only single water wash section was used. The composition of the CO2 produced (from the desorber) was also measured. It was shown that the main pollutants were water vapor (3&#8211;4 % vol.), ammonia (2&#8211;6 ppmv), nitrogen oxide, formaldehyde, and formic acid (sum, up to 10 ppmv). Traces of acetone were also detected. The composition of this gas is of practical importance for the planned management of the captured CO2 stream. During the studies, the CO2 capture efficiency was in the range of 86.6 %-94.6 %. The average specific reboiler heat duty (gross) was 3.24 MJ/kg of removed CO2.</description>

                A novel series of nickel (Ni) loaded on Fibrous Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles (CHE-SM) support with varying Ni contents (x=1 to 30 wt.%) were synthesized, denoted as xNi/CHE-SM and then investigated for carbon dioxide (CO2) methanation. The catalysts underwent comprehensive characterization using XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, FESEM, FTIR-KBr, H2-TPR, and CO2-TPD techniques. The XRD and FESEM analyses confirmed the structural integrity of CHE-SM, irrespective of the Ni loading. However, the size of the nanocrystalline NiO particles appeared to be influenced by the Ni loading. Notably, 20Ni/CHE-SM exhibited the highest CO2 conversion of 92% at 350 &#176;C, demonstrating its potential for low-temperature activation. H2-TPR and CO2-TPD results revealed favorable NiO reduction at lower temperatures, indicating medium-strength basicity that facilitated efficient CO2 and H2 adsorption and activation. Consequently, 20Ni/CHE-SM exhibited superior catalytic performance compared to other catalysts, with lower activation energy (61.5 kJ/mol). Kinetic studies focusing on 20Ni/CHE-SM indicated a molecular adsorption mechanism of CO2 and H2 on a single site after evaluation using four Langmuir-Hinshelwood models. This result was attributed to the high amount of medium strength basicity possessed by the 20Ni/CHE-SM catalyst which provided an abundance of adsorption sites, resulting in greater fractional coverage of reactants and enhancing the CH4 formation rate.</description>

      <title>CO oxidation mechanism of silver&#8208;substituted Mo/Cu CO&#8208;dehydrogenase. Analogies and differences to the native enzyme</title>

                The aerobic oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide is catalysed by the Mo/Cu&#8208;containing CO&#8208;dehydrogenase enzyme in the soil bacterium Oligotropha carboxidovorans, enabling the organism to grow on the small gas molecule as carbon and energy source. It was shown experimentally that silver can be substituted for copper in the active site of Mo/Cu CODH to yield a functional enzyme. In this study, we employed QM/MM calculations to investigate whether the reaction mechanism of the silver&#8208;substituted enzyme is similar to that of the native enzyme. Our results suggest that the Ag&#8208;substituted enzyme can oxidize CO and release CO2 following the same reaction steps as the native enzyme, with a computed rate&#8208;limiting step of 10.4 kcal/mol, consistent with experimental findings. Surprisingly, lower activation energies for C&#8211;O bond formation have been found in the presence of silver. Furthermore, comparison of rate constants for reduction of copper&#8208; and silver&#8208;containing enzymes suggests a discrepancy in the transition state stabilization upon silver substitution. We also evaluated the effects that differences in the water&#8208;active site interaction may exert on the overall energy profile of catalysis. Finally, the formation of a thiocarbonate intermediate along the catalytic pathway was found to be energetically unfavorable for the Ag&#8208;substituted enzyme.</description>

      <title>Impact of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and related temperature rise on wildlife population: A modeling study</title>

                Climate change is driven by the increase in greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere, especially carbon dioxide (CO2), leading to a rise in the global average temperature. This temperature rise unleash far-reaching and profound consequences on various living organisms. In this research work, we formulate a nonlinear mathematical model to perceive the impact of rising temperature on wildlife species. In formulating the model, we take into account that the escalating CO2 concentration contributes to a rise in the global average temperature, thereby impacting the growth rate of wildlife population. We pinpoint the sufficient conditions for all the dynamic variables to reach their simultaneous equilibrium levels. The model analysis reveals a spectrum of bifurcations, including transcritical, Hopf, saddle&#8211;node, and Bogdanov&#8211;Takens bifurcations. Further, the examination of transcritical bifurcation led to the identification of a critical reduction rate of wildlife species due to human activities above which the wildlife population may teeter on the brink of extinction under the considered stressor of temperature rise. This extinction of wildlife species can be avoided by increasing the carrying capacity of forest biomass. Also, we have shown that for a specific set of parameter values, there exists a bistability between the forest-wildlife free equilibrium and the coexisting equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Can China Reach Its Carbon Peak Before 2030? An Empirical Study Based on China's Carbon Emission Data</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54254/2754-1169/75/20241647</link>
      <description>Chaozhong Guo, Advances in economics, management and political sciences. 75(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394855624

                The global surge in the warming trend is predominantly attributed to the substantial release of greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide. Despite continuous international efforts to curb these emissions, our country, marked by the largest population and energy consumption, stands as a major contributor to carbon dioxide emissions. Unlike developed nations, we face a more formidable challenge in reducing emissions, demanding intensified endeavors. To address climate change, our nation has set a crucial carbon emission target: achieving a carbon peak before 2030 and attaining carbon neutrality by 2060. The "14th Five-Year Plan" of each province underscores the significance of "carbon peaking and carbon neutrality," tailoring emission reduction policies to individual economic landscapes. Current research inadequacies hinder theoretical guidance needed to meet the 2030 carbon peak. Crafting province-specific emission reduction strategies is thus imperative. This study aims to scrutinize national and regional carbon dioxide emissions in four distinct Chinese regions, utilizing the STIRPAT model to predict emissions from 2020 to 2030 under the "low development and strong low carbon" paradigm. Initial analysis from 2004 to 2019 showed an annual increase in national and provincial carbon dioxide emissions, revealing significant regional differences. Six prominent factors influencing emissions were identified. The STIRPAT model predicted emissions for 2020 to 2030, indicating that achieving carbon peaking before 2030 is unfeasible under the baseline scenario. However, within the "low development and strong low carbon" framework, attaining this goal becomes plausible.</description>

                In this work, agricultural biomass waste was gasified in a two-zone tubular reactor in the presence of steam. Firstly, during preliminary experiments the effect of temperature in the 1st and 2nd reactor zone, as well as the influence of catalysts and steam/raw material ratio was investigated, then the reusability of catalysts was also studied during ten regeneration cycles. Based on the preliminary results, in the 1st reactor zone a lower temperature was used (400&#176;C), where the yield of carbon dioxide was &#8764;55%, which has a positive effect on numerous reactions, also it can be converted to carbon monoxide with proper catalysts with in-situ process. Regarding the temperature, it is important to be mentioned that a significant difference was observed in the yield of synthesis gas at 700&#176;C thus, the experiments were carried out using 700&#176;C in the 2nd reactor zone. A natural (Clinoptilolite) and a synthetic zeolite (ZSM-5), a mesoporous alumina (Al2O3) and a carbon dioxide capturing carrier (CaO) were selected and impregnated with nickel for further use and for enhancing the yield of synthesis gas and hydrogen during the gasification process. The utilization of catalysts helped the in-situ reduction of carbon dioxide while their performance in the gasification process during the regeneration cycles was also investigated. Henceforward, the tested Ni/ZSM-5, Ni/Al2O3 and Ni/Clinoptilolite, reduced the amount of carbon monoxide from the 5th regeneration cycles, while the amount carbon dioxide with the four mentioned catalysts was decreased by 15-35 mmol/g raw material, compared to the results obtained during thermal degradation.</description>

      <title>Characterization and Flame-Retardant Properties of Cobalt-Coordinated Cyclic Phosphonitrile in Thermoplastic Polyurethane Composites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29081869</link>
      <description>Xiangcong Zeng, Zhi Xu, Hu Li, Yun Xiong, Yigang Ding, XU Li-li, Shengpeng Liu, Molecules/Molecules online/Molecules annual. 29(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394941830

                Halogen-free organophosphorus flame retardants have promising application prospects due to their excellent safety and environmental protection properties. A cobalt-coordinated cyclic phosphonitrile flame retardant (Co@CPA) was synthesized via a hydrothermal method using hexachlorocyclotriphosphonitrile (HCCP), 5-amino-tetrazolium (5-AT), and cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2&#8729;6H2O) as starting materials. The structure was characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) composites were prepared by incorporating 10-(2,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-9,10-dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphame-10-oxide (ODOPB), Co@CPA, and silicon dioxide (SiO2) via melt blending. The flame-retardant performance and thermal stability of the TPU composites were evaluated through limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical combustion (UL-94), TG, and cone calorimetric (CCT) tests. SEM and Raman spectroscopy were used to analyze the surface morphology and structure of the residual carbon. A synergistic flame-retardant effect of ODOPB and Co@CPA was observed, with the most effective flame retardancy achieved at a TPU:ODOPB:Co@CPA:SiO2 ratio of 75:16:8:1. This composition exhibited an LOI value of 26.5% and achieved a V-0 rating in the UL-94 test. Furthermore, compared to pure TPU, the composite showed reductions in total heat release, CO production, and CO2 production by 6.6%, 39.4%, and 48.9%, respectively. Our research findings suggest that Co@CPA demonstrates outstanding performance, with potential for further expansion in application areas. Different metal-based cyclic phosphonitrile compounds are significant in enriching phosphorus-based fine chemicals.</description>

                Future structures based on cement-based composite materials must be more versatile, durable, and strong in addition to being environmentally friendly and sustainable. With the introduction of nanomaterials, it is possible to improve their compressive strength, flexural strength, tensile strength, elastic modulus, toughness, heat of hydration, thermoelectric conversion efficiency, thermoelectric figure of merit, power factor, Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, piezoelectric coefficient, defect reduction and cracks, and reduction of liquid and gas permeation, among others. This chapter aims to review the multifunctional contributions that nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), MXenes, titanium dioxide or titania, silicon dioxide or silica, lithium carbonate, calcium carbonate, and perovskite oxides are making in the improvement of cement-based composite materials. Without a doubt, this research topic will continue to drive technological and scientific innovation in the construction industry in this century.</description>

                We examine the effect of climate-induced temporary extreme weather events on the natural real interest rate by incorporating environmental aspects into a Keynesian growth model. We find that environmental damage accentuates the reduction in the natural real interest rate caused by climate-induced temporary supply disruptions, and this effect is even more pronounced when the estimate of the current stock of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles.</description>

      <title>Green Synthesizing and Corrosion Inhibition Characteristics of Azo Compounds on Carbon Steel under Sweet Conditions: Experimental and Theoretical Approaches</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c09072</link>
      <description>K. Shalabi, Hany M. Abd El&#8208;Lateef, M. Hammouda, Antar A. Abdelhamid, ACS omega. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394951977

                The deterioration of carbon steel in saline solutions enriched with carbon dioxide represents a significant challenge within the oil and gas industry. So, this study focuses on the design and structural analysis of four azo derivatives: 4-(2-quinolinylazo)-catechol (AZN-1), 4-(4-phenoxyphenylazo)-1-naphthol (AZN-2), 4-(4-pyridylazo)-1-naphthol (AZN-3), and 4-(2-pyridylazo)-1-naphthol (AZN-4), and their first application as effective corrosion inhibitors for carbon steel in a carbon dioxide saturated 3.5% sodium chloride solution. Spectroscopic methods were used to characterize the structural configurations of these compounds. The corrosion protection properties of these compounds on carbon steel in a carbon dioxide saturated 3.5% sodium chloride solution (under sweet conditions) were investigated using Tafel polarization (PDP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) studies. The results indicate that the inhibition efficiency increases as the concentration of the inhibitors increases. There is a notable agreement between the results obtained from the PDP and EIS measurements, supporting the findings. Moreover, the results displayed that these compounds had significant corrosion protection capabilities at low concentrations, ranging from 91.0 to 98.3% at an additive concentration of 5 &#215; 10&#8211;4 M. The PDP profiles showed that these compounds acted as mixed inhibitors, and their adsorption behavior followed the Langmuir isotherm model. Besides, EIS results corroborate the adsorption of AZN compounds through a reduction in double-layer capacitance (Cdl) alongside an augmentation in polarization resistance (Rp) after the addition of AZN compounds into the corrosive solution. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis confirmed the formation of a protective layer on the surface of carbon steel when these inhibitors were applied. In addition, computational calculations and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to support the experimental observations, gain insights into the adsorption properties, and elucidate the corrosion inhibition mechanisms of these compounds.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Air Pollution Changes during COVID-19 Pandemic in Jiangsu Province of China from 2018 to 2021</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5829/ijee.2024.15.04.11</link>
      <description>Anbu Clemensis Johnson, Iranica journal of energy and environment. 15(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394896727

                The COVID-19 pandemic, which began during early 2020, had been a worldwide problem, resulting in significant fatalities. In China, the pandemic resulted in strict lockdowns, restricted movement, and reduced transportation. This resulted in improvement of air quality in many cities in China. The objective of the study is to compare the nature of air quality pre-COVID period (2018-2019) and during COVID period (2020-2201). The following air quality parameters were investigated, air quality index (AQI), particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and carbon monoxide (CO). The present investigation results will augment to the current understanding on the air pollution situation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jiangsu Province in China. The study revealed that air quality in Jiangsu Province improved during the months when COVID-19 positive cases increased. The reduction in air pollutants concentrations started during 2020 and reached a maximum during 2021. Overall the air quality index (AQI) improved by 8.2 % and air pollutant reductions achieved were, PMs (&#8776; 21%), SO2 (26.2 %), NO2 (13.6 %), O3 (2.4 %) and CO (10.4 %). Cities in Jiangsu Province with high air pollutant concentrations achieved a moderate reduction. The correlation between air pollutants and AQI was positive except for O3. The implications of the study are, reduction of fossil fuel powered vehicles and industrial activity can make notable positive impact on the air quality of the region.</description>

      <title>Emission of CO&amp;lt;SUB align="right"&amp;gt;2 and air pollutants from cement industry in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (2018-2020) and its reduction forecast</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1504/ijep.2023.137987</link>
      <description>Wenling Dang, Zhenxue Jing, Wenjing Zong, Yueling Zhang, International journal of environment and pollution. 72(2/3/4)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4394864868

                The emission factor method is utilised to establish an emission inventory of CO2 and air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NOx, CO, VOC, NH3) for the cement industry in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region from 2018 to 2020. CO2 and CO are prominent among the eight atmospheric emissions, up to 55.06 Mt, 45.40 Mt, and 66.87 Mt, and 123.74 kt, 99.42 kt, and 147.02 kt in 2018-2020, respectively. Furthermore, the emissions from Tangshan and Shijiazhuang account for nearly 50% of the total emissions in the region, based on the design capacity of cement enterprises in different cities. Finally, considering emission reduction technologies and the impact of cement production, the potential for CO2 and major air pollutant emissions reduction in 2030 and 2050 is predicted. According to the scenarios, the emission reduction of CO2, PM2.5, SO2, and NOx will all exceed half in 2030.</description>

      <title>Microbiological Activity of Chernozem in the Combined Use of Potassium Chloride with Nitrogen Fertilizers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.31857/s0032180x22600822</link>
      <description>K. V. Pavlov, E. V. Morachevskaya, A. P. Vlasova, N. A. Manucharova, Po&#269;vovedenie. None(1)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4394955319

                In order to assess the possible toxic effect of potassium chloride used in conjunction with mineral nitrogen fertilizers the authors studied the structural and functional components of the microbial complex of chernozem, in particular, its prokaryotic component. The object of research was soil samples of typical chernozem, selected from the vegetation experience with variants with the introduction of nitrogen-phosphorus and ni-trogen-phosphorus-potassium fertilizers. To obtain a stable effect of easily soluble salts on the microbial community of the soil, long-term composting of soil samples was carried out with alternating cycles of moistening and drying of the soil. During the first two years of composting, the researches detected the suppression of carbon dioxide emissions; however the suppression leveled out only 5 years later. The initial reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, as well as denitrification activity, reached twofold values. The negative effect was manifested when the content of chlorides and nitrates in the soil was significantly lower than the gradation established for slightly saline soils. Prolonged composting of samples of fertile chernozem under the action of potassium chloride led to a decrease in the number and biomass of the metabolically active prokaryotic complex, which confirms its toxic effect on the microbial community of the soil. The representatives of the prokaryotic complex that are resistant and sensitive to the increased content of chlorides and nitrates in the soil have been identified. Among the representatives of the Bacteria domain, almost all were sensitive, with the exception of two phyllum Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia. For some representatives of the phylogenetic group Actinobacteria, sensitivity to chlorine ions is confirmed at the generic level (Streptomyces and Micromonospora). For the Archaea domain, representatives of the Euryarchaeota phylum are identified as the most resistant to the presence of chlorides. Thus, the suppression of the microbiological activity of chernozem during the introduction of potassium chloride explains the previously identified decrease in the availability of nutrients for plants.</description>

      <title>A New Model of Carbon Nitride as a Substrate to Support Single Metal Atom</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c00975</link>
      <description>Pan Du, Shengwei Deng, Liang Chen, Ziqi Tian, Journal of physical chemistry. C./Journal of physical chemistry. C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394933990

                Carbon nitrides are commonly employed as substrates to anchor single metal atoms. Numerous theoretical studies have previously characterized these single-atom systems using the pristine g-C3N4 structure, featuring a C6N7 motif. However, the relatively large pores in g-C3N4 may not effectively coordinate with metal cations, resulting in discordance with the coordination environment determined by experimental characterization. In this study, we introduce a novel model denoted as CN-N4, which preserves the essential g-C3N4 motif, while offering four nitrogen sites for metal binding. Compared with g-C3N4, the binding affinity between the metal and this new substrate model is significantly enhanced, similar to that of a commonly studied nitrogen-doped graphene model (N-gra). Additionally, we have assessed the catalytic performance in various reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The CN-N4-supported system exhibits activity comparable to that of the corresponding N-gra-supported species. Fe- and Co-centered SACs can be promising catalysts for ORR, and relatively stable Cu-g-C3N4 is active to HER and CO2RR, consistent with reported experiments. In addition, V-CN-N4 and Rh-CN-N4 are predicted to be candidates to catalyze the HER and ORR, respectively. We suggest that the CN-N4 model aptly captures the local structure of carbon nitride-based materials with a high coordination number, providing an alternative foundation for investigating the reaction mechanisms of these single-atom catalysts.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Environmental Road and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Effects through LCA of the 4 Major Machine Tool Remanufacturing</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.62765/kjlca.2021.22.1.15</link>

                The industrial sector that can actively respond to the circular economy is remanufacturing. In the case of machine tools, the need for remanufacturing of machine tools is emphasized because it is expected that waste products will increase before the mechanical life expires due to the change in perception of low carbon energy reduction and the increase in demand for advanced high-precision machine tools due to the development of ultra-precision industry. This study calculated the environmental load and greenhouse gas reduction effects through LCA analysis of the remanufacturing of four major machine tools used throughout the industry, such as grinding machines, planar millers, presses, and lathes, using LCA. Due to the nature of the remanufacturing process, some consumables are replaced or put in to improve quality and function by using the core of the product (or part) after use. In the case of cores used in the remanufacturing process, environmental impacts have already occurred during manufacturing by new manufacturers. In remanufacturing, only the environmental impacts caused by the use of newly input auxiliary materials and energy, excluding cores, occur. As a result of the Midpoint LCA analysis, the amount of reduction in environmental impact for each product remanufactured were 4,439 kg CO2 eq. per machine based on the global warming impact category during characterization, the planar miller 90,080 kg CO2 eq., the press 636,390 kg CO2 eq., the lathe 24,638 kg CO2 eq., it was found that the reduction of environmental impact was the highest when one press was remanufactured.</description>

      <title>Optimizing hybrid energy systems for remote communities in Asias least developed countries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e29369</link>
      <description>Mengly Prum, Hui Hwang Goh, Dongdong Zhang, Wei Dai, Tonni Agustiono Kurniawan, Kai Chen Goh, Heliyon. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394883903

                ABSTRACT In least-developed countries (LDCs), electricity shortages are the primary barrier to economic and social growth. Some remote areas in LDC rely on diesel-based systems. However, renewable energy must be taken into account for generating electricity because of the uncertainty of diesel fuel prices and the emissions of carbon dioxide. Hybrid energy systems (HES) are becoming increasingly popular, which is unsurprising given the rapid advancement of renewable energy technologies, which have made them the preferred method to respond to the current unreliable electricity supply, reduce the impact of global warming that occurs from electricity production, and contribute to cost reduction. This study explores the feasibility of utilizing a combination of solar PV, wind energy, and battery systems with the existing diesel generator in four different locations in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. Hybrid optimization multiples for electric renewables (HOMER) is used as a tool for techno-economic analysis and finding the possible combination of solar PV, wind, diesel, and battery. The multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique was used to verify all configurations obtained from HOMER's results. This approach considers environmental, economic, and technological factors by utilizing the AHP, TOPSIS, EDAS, and PROMETHEEE II techniques. The results show that PV/diesel with batteries is the optimum solution. This hybrid system comprises 89% PV penetration, a cost of electricity (COE) of 0.257 $/kWh, an initial capital cost (IC) of $244,277, and a net present cost (NPC) of $476,216 for a case study in Cambodia. Furthermore, this system can reduce almost 51,005 kg/year of carbon dioxide compared to a diesel-only system, while the cost of electricity is reduced.</description>

                There is a growing interest in creating cost-effective catalysts for efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to address pressing environmental issues and produce valuable products. A bimetallic ZnBi catalyst that enhances catalytic activity and stability toward the electrochemical reduction of CO2 is designed. It is based on bismuth nanodendrites grown using a facile, scalable, and low-cost method. The results have shown that the incorporation of bismuth can decrease the charge transfer resistance and facilitate CO2 reduction toward the formation of CO and formate. It was revealed that the ZnBi catalyst exhibited higher catalytic activity compared with that of the pure Zn catalyst for CO2 reduction, with a lower onset potential [&#8722;0.75 V vs a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) compared with &#8722;0.85 V vs RHE for Zn]. In situ electrochemical attenuated total internal reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was employed to study the reaction mechanism, showing the formation of CO and formate through the adsorbed *COO&#8211; intermediates. This study has demonstrated a new approach for the feasible synthesis of high-performance catalysts for large-scale electrochemical CO2 reduction.</description>

      <title>Carbon neutrality in Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur: insights from stakeholder-driven integrated assessment modeling</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2024.1336045</link>
      <description>Maridee Weber, Leeya Pressburger, Loon Wai Chau, Zarrar Khan, Taryn Waite, Michael Westphal, Gabriel Hoh Teck Ling, Chin Siong Ho, Meredydd Evans, Frontiers in energy research. 12(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394930838

                Introduction: Several cities in Malaysia have established plans to reduce their CO 2 emissions, in addition to Malaysia submitting a Nationally Determined Contribution to reduce its carbon intensity (against GDP) by 45% in 2030 compared to 2005. Meeting these emissions reduction goals will require a joint effort between governments, industries, and corporations at different scales and across sectors. Methods: In collaboration with national and sub-national stakeholders, we developed and used a global integrated assessment model to explore emissions mitigation pathways in Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur. Guided by current climate action plans, we created a suite of scenarios to reflect uncertainties in policy ambition, level of adoption, and implementation for reaching carbon neutrality. Through iterative engagement with all parties, we refined the scenarios and focus of the analysis to best meet the stakeholders&#8217; needs. Results: We found that Malaysia can reduce its carbon intensity and reach carbon neutrality by 2050, and that action in Kuala Lumpur can play a significant role. Decarbonization of the power sector paired with extensive electrification, energy efficiency improvements in buildings, transportation, and industry, and the use of advanced technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage will be major drivers to mitigate emissions, with carbon dioxide removal strategies being key to eliminate residual emissions. Discussion: Our results suggest a hopeful future for Malaysia&#8217;s ability to meet its climate goals, recognizing that there may be technological, social, and financial challenges along the way. This study highlights the participatory process in which stakeholders contributed to the development of the model and guided the analysis, as well as insights into Malaysia&#8217;s decarbonization potential and the role of multilevel governance.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical synthesis of formamide by C&#8211;N coupling with amine and CO2 with a high faradaic efficiency of 37.5%</title>

                Summary N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) is a versatile chemical and universal solvent that is commonly synthesized from carbon monoxide and dimethylamine (DMA) under high temperature and pressure. However, this process leads to a large amount of carbon emissions. Herein, we propose an electrochemical strategy to directly convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and DMA to DMF under ambient conditions. Loading palladium (Pd) onto copper (Cu) nanosheet catalysts with Cu vacancies (Pd/Cu-VCu) enabled the efficient synthesis of DMF, and the maximum yield and faradaic efficiency reached 385 mmol&#183;h&#8722;1&#183;gcat. &#8722;1 and 37.5%, respectively. In situ spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations indicated that Cu vacancies (Cu-VCu) promoted the adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface, followed by its spontaneous coupling with DMA to form the C&#8211;N bond. Pd nanoparticles accelerated the electrochemical reduction of the intermediate &#8727;OCN(CH3)2OH to &#8727;OCHN(CH3)2OH, leading to highly efficient DMF electrosynthesis. This work paves the way for the synthesis of sustainable high-value organic nitrogen compounds from CO2.</description>

      <title>Co-Ni on zirconia and titania catalysts for methane decomposition to hydrogen and carbon nanomaterials: The role of metal-support interactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2024.131675</link>
      <description>Wasim Ullah Khan, Dwi Hantoko, Idris A. Bakare, Ahmed Al Shoaibi, Srinivasakannan Chandrasekar, Mohammad M. Hossain, Fuel. 369(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394803866

                Cobalt and nickel-based bimetallic catalysts supported over titanium dioxide and zirconia were synthesized using the mechanical mixing method and investigated for catalytic methane decomposition reaction. The total contents of both metals were kept at 15 wt% and the ratio between cobalt and nickel remained one. The catalyst characterization prior to reaction showed that zirconia-supported nickel and cobalt-based catalysts represented as ZNC exhibited weaker metal-support interaction as well as easily reducible active species while titania-supported nickel and cobalt-based catalysts denoted as TNC had relatively stronger metal-support interaction. The activity results revealed that ZNC activated at 500 &#176;C (ZNC-500) catalysts performed better with a maximum hydrogen production rate of 7.26 mol/gM/s than their TNC counterparts i.e., TNC-500 (5.83 mol/gM/s). The elevated activation temperature resulted in the loss of activity that was assigned to metal particle agglomeration. Moreover, elevated activation temperature caused the reduction of surface oxide species without allowing the reduction of bulk oxide species. The extent of interaction between the metal and the support, reducibility, and the degree of metal particle aggregation have significantly influenced the catalytic activity as well as carbon growth mechanisms of the catalysts. The characterization of spent catalysts using SEM and TEM discovered that carbon nanomaterials were formed over the surface of the catalysts and each catalyst followed either base-growth and/or tip-growth mechanism.</description>

                In a context where clean energy has become almost an imperative, investments in renewable energy projects play an important role for achieving the sustainability of scarce resources needed for the well-being of future generations. Driven by the fact of climate change and the very need for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions all around the world, renewable energy economy has expanded with increasing participation of investors and new types of innovative financial techniques. One of the most striking innovative financial techniques is green bonds, started with the issuance of the &#65533;climate awareness bond&#65533; by the European Investment Bank in 2007. International Capital Market Association&#65533;s (ICMA) publication of the Green Bond Principles (GBPs) in 2014, further motivated the expansion of the green bond market. Green bonds, are fixed-income securities which are issued to finance exclusively positive impact generating projects related to environment and climate change. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the development of global green bond markets with their related advantages, disadvantages, and policy implications. A green policy proposal will be made for enhancing the financing of renewable energy projects.</description>

      <title>Research about the management of CCS control with specific consideration of Life Cycle</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.62765/kjlca.2011.12.1.40</link>

                Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technique for trapping CO2 as it is emitted from large point sources, compressing it, and transporting it to a suitable storage site where it is injected into the ground. CCS system can attribute to the reduction of CO2 and currently many projects in the world are commercializing. In South Korea, many researches are concentrated upon the CO2 capture processes in CCS system. In this study, we evaluated environmental impact of CCS infrastructure system, which has CO2 capture, transportation and storage stage using life cycle assessment (LCA). Also we assessed the costs for each CCS stage operation with scenarios. As a result, the global warming impact in a system without CO2 capture process was 9.64E+04g CO2-eq and a system with CO2 capture process had 1.45E+05g CO2-eq. About 1,368 kJ/ton CO2 energy is required for CO2 capture and it could remove 90% of occurred total CO2 from electricity generation. The result of life cycle cost analysis shows that the cost of 500MW size electricity generation and CCS system is 1,045 million US dollar and the operation cost per year is 154~267 million US dollar. As a result of the life cycle costing, current value of 20 years total cost is 4,236 million US dollar. For the future dissemination of CCS system, the database of the quantified environmental impacts and cost analysis in each stage (capture, transport and storage) should be updated and constructed regularly.</description>

                Economic growth has brought global climate change into the spotlight, and CO2 emissions demonstrate significant challenges in reducing environmental shifts worldwide. Globally, the United States and China contribute the greatest amount of CO2 emissions. The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between different types of CO2 emissions and economic growth by using a modeling approach. We analyze total CO2 emissions, coal CO2 emissions, oil CO2 emissions, the global share of coal CO2 emissions, the global share of oil CO2 emissions, and economic growth. This study provides unique insights into how to simultaneously reduce CO2 emissions and sustain economic growth. A bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag (BARDL) simulation method is utilized to examine the long- and short-run effects of repressors on CO2 emissions. Coal CO2 emissions are found to have a significant positive effect on economic growth in the short run but a negative impact over the long run in the United States. The United States needs to implement stronger measures to balance coal CO2 emissions with economic growth for sustainable development. In contrast, oil CO2 emissions are positive for China in both the long run and short run. Thus, China can continue to reduce CO2 emissions from oil while maintaining positive economic growth. The Chinese policy can be adapted and implemented to maintain a balance between economic growth and carbon reduction. The study has valuable insights for policymakers seeking to balance economic growth with carbon reduction, emphasizing the need to better understand CO2 emissions' relationship with economic growth.</description>

                The electrochemical reduction of CO2 on catalyst surfaces is hindered by the inefficient mass transfer of CO2 in aqueous solutions. In this study, we employed an electrochemical reduction approach to fabricate a hydrophobic three-dimensional nanoporous silver catalyst with a plastron effect, aiming to enhance the CO2 diffusion. The resulting catalyst exhibited an exceptional performance with the FECO peaking at 95% at -0.65 V (vs. RHE) and demonstrated remarkable stability during continuous electrolysis for 48 hours. Control experiments, together with Tafel analysis, EIS measurements, and contact angle results, confirmed that the notable enhancement of performance was attributed to the hydrophobic porous structure that facilitated efficient storage and rapid mass transfer of low-solubility CO2 gas reactants.</description>

                This study aimed to compare the environmental aspects of different water treatment systems using life cycle assessment (LCA). The target system of this study is the three different physical treatment systems which are sand filtration, pressurized type membrane filtration and immersed type membrane filtration. The key environmental issues in this study are analyzed in terms of abiotic resource depletion (ARD) and global warming potential(GWP). As a result, sand filtration represents the worst environmental impact. In case of GWP, sand filtration is about 17 and 27.5% higher than pressurized type and immersed type membrane filtration. ARD has same trend compare with GWP. Impact of sand filtration is about 16.5 and 27.4% higher than. Most of impacts are caused by electricity which considers 40 years operation time of the system. And we can derive benefit from trading of CO2 on market. If we sell tons of CO2 which come from emission reduction, we can earn around 463 thousands and 748 thousands euro from exchange sand filtration for pressurized type and immersed type one. Immersed type by this study is the best choice for reduction of CO2 and sustainable water supply.</description>

                This paper assesses maintenance costs and reliability associated with additional risk reduction measures in a methanol plant to achieve an "as low as reasonably practicable" (ALARP) target risk level of 1 &#215; 10&#8722;7 yearly. It proposes an approach to evaluate maintenance and reliability using economic loss risks, focusing on incidents involving piping and reactor operations. The study examines economic losses from fatalities, injuries, equipment damage, business interruptions, and emergency services due to toxicity, thermal radiation, and overpressure events at different reactor pressures. Case studies involve comparing five plants: a 76 bar normal methanol plant with a 42 m3 reactor and four modified plants with 7.6 m3 reactors at pressure of 76, 200, 350, and 500 bar. The methanol reactor contains hazardous substances: hydrogen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and methanol. Losses, including fatalities, injuries, equipment damage, are estimated by combining consequence analysis outcomes with individual and equipment values. Business disruptions consider downtime and industry value added per employee, while emergency service losses amount to two percent of the total. Results indicate the normal methanol plant needs RM 12.7 million annually for maintenance to achieve ALARP, while modified plants reduce costs by 75% to 91% compared to the normal methanol plant.</description>

                This study aims an optimal design and performance assessment of fuel cell-based energy system for a university campus. To fulfil the average daily load, solar PV and fuel cell with combined heat and power system operate as the primary source. In the initial process, electrolyzer generates green hydrogen and solid oxide fuel cell converts the stored hydrogen into electricity with byproduct heat. Heat is further utilized with combined heat and power process performed by the thermionic and thermoelectric generators. Therefore, six different grid-connected and standalone hybrid systems are simulated in HOMER Pro software to get the optimum energy system. The performance of an optimized grid-connected solar PV-Fuel Cell system offers the optimum results: the overall green hydrogen production is 0.28 million kg/yr with levelized cost of 6.94 $/kg and the recovered heat is 1.19 GWh/yr. The electricity contributes 62.54% from solar PV, 22.45% from fuel cell, 2.91% from thermionic, 1.12% from thermoelectric, 10.95% purchase from grid, and 22.67% sold to the grid. The optimal system has $25.95 million of net present cost, 0.1084 $/kWh of levelized energy cost with 0.072 kg/kWh of carbon dioxide emissions. The overall reduction in carbon emission is 5.6% comparative to natural gas-fuelled energy system.</description>

      <title>In situ/operando spectroscopic evidence on associative redox mechanism for periodic unsteady-state water&#8211;gas shift reaction on Au/CeO2 catalyst</title>

                Cyclic and repeatable CO2/H2 formation under periodic CO &#8596; H2O feeds, that is unsteady-state water&#8211;gas shift reaction (uss-WGS), was found to be catalyzed by a gold nanoparticles-loaded CeO2 (Au/CeO2) catalyst. Kinetics of the CO-reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+ and Ce3+ reoxidation by H2O in combination with transient CO2/H2 formation over Au/CeO2 were studied by operando ultraviolet&#8211;visible (UV&#8211;vis) and infrared (IR) spectroscopies at 175 &#176;C. The Ce4+&#8211;OH species were reduced by CO to give Ce3+-&#9633;-Ce3+ (&#9633;: oxygen vacancy) and gas phase products (H2, CO2). The Ce3+-&#9633;-Ce3+ species were oxidized by H2O to give H2 and Ce4+&#8211;OH species. The reduction and reoxidation rates of Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple were close to the rates of transient CO2/H2 formation. The X-ray absorption spectroscopy results showed that the oxidation states of Au remained unchanged during the redox reactions. These results indicate that the uss-WGS is primary driven by the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple. Combined with the observation of adsorbed carboxylate intermediates as a precursor of H2 and CO2, associative redox mechanism is proposed as the main pathway for the unsteady-state WGS reaction on Au/CeO2 at 175 &#176;C.</description>

                Abstract. One of the proposed ways to reduce the climate impact of civil aviation is rerouting aircraft to minimise the formation of warming contrails. As this strategy may increase fuel consumption, it would only be beneficial if the climate impact reduction from the avoided contrails exceeds the negative impact of any additional carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by the rerouted flight. In this study, we calculate the surface temperature response of almost half-a-million flights that crossed the North Atlantic sector in 2019 and compare to the response of hypothetical rerouted flights. The climate impacts of contrails and CO2 are assessed through the perspective of CO2-equivalence metrics, defined here as nine combinations of different definitions and time horizons. We estimate that the total emitted CO2 and the persistent contrails formed will have warmed the climate by 16.9 &#181;K in 2039, 13.5 &#181;K in 2069, and 14.0 &#181;K in 2119. Under a scenario where 1 % additional carbon dioxide is enough to reroute all contrail-forming flights and avoid contrail formation completely, total warming would decrease by 4.6 (&#8722;27 %), 2.4 (&#8722;18 %), and 1.8 (&#8722;13 %) &#956;K in 2039, 2069, and 2119, respectively. In most rerouting cases, the results based on the nine different CO2-equivalence metrics agree that rerouting leads to a climate benefit, assuming that contrails are avoided as predicted. But the size of that benefit is very dependent on the choice of CO2-equivalence metrics, contrail efficacy and CO2 penalty. Sources of uncertainty not considered here could also heavily influence the perceived benefit. In about 10 % of rerouting cases, the climate damage resulting from contrail avoidance indicated by CO2-equivalence metrics integrated over a 100-year time horizon is not predicted by metrics integrated over a 20-year time horizon. This study highlights, using North Atlantic flights as a case study, the implications of the choice of CO2-equivalence metrics for contrail avoidance, but the choice is ultimately political.</description>

      <title>Contribution of electrical impedance tomography to personalize positive end-expiratory pressure under ECCO2R</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1186/s13054-024-04908-0</link>
      <description>Benjamin P&#233;quignot, Alain Combes, Micka&#235;l Lescroart, Bruno L&#233;vy, Matthieu Koszutski, Critical care. 28(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394845977

                Abstract Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal (ECCO 2 R) is used in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients to facilitate lung-protective ventilatory strategies. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) allows individual, non-invasive, real-time, bedside, radiation-free imaging of the lungs, providing global and regional dynamic lung analyses. To provide new insights for future ECCO2R research in ARDS, we propose a potential application of EIT to personalize End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) following each reduction in tidal volume (VT), as demonstrated in an illustrative case. A 72-year-old male with COVID-19 was admitted to the ICU for moderate ARDS. Monitoring with EIT was started to determine the optimal PEEP value (PEEP EIT ), defined as the intersection of the collapse and overdistention curves, after each reduction in VT during ECCO 2 R. The identified PEEP EIT values were notably low (&lt; 10 cmH2O). The decrease in VT associated with PEEP EIT levels resulted in improved lung compliance, reduced driving pressure and a more uniform ventilation pattern. Despite current Randomized Controlled Trials showing that ultra-protective ventilation with ECCO 2 R does not improve survival, the applicability of universal ultra-protective ventilation settings for all patients remains a subject of debate. Inappropriately set PEEP levels can lead to alveolar collapse or overdistension, potentially negating the benefits of VT reduction. EIT facilitates real-time monitoring of derecruitment associated with VT reduction, guiding physicians in determining the optimal PEEP value after each decrease in tidal volume. This original description of using EIT under ECCO 2 R to adjust PEEP at a level compromising between recruitability and overdistention could be a crucial element for future research on ECCO 2 R.</description>

                Relevance. Currently, the standardization at the international level has reached a high stage in the aviation industry. The high requirements for standardization of airfreight refer to the safety and punctuality of air travel. Purpose. The purpose of this study was to modernize and improve the technology of consolidation of dangerous goods into fire-resistant unit load device containers, which will reduce the risk of fire spread, and enable the crew to make a landing in the event of an incident. Methodology. The basis of the methodological approach in this study is a combination of system analysis of the main areas of the introduction of fire-resistant containers in modern air transport, with an analytical investigation of the main areas of modernization of fire-resistant containers intended for the transportation of dangerous goods, which in the future will contribute to a significant reduction in the risks of fires during air transportation and other emergencies that may cause forced landings of air transport. Results. It was determined that the use of fire-resistant containers reduces fuel costs and environmental improvements by minimizing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Conclusions. Thus, the developers of modern refractory materials used in the manufacture of air cargo containers have broad prospects. In addition, the use of such containers will improve working conditions due to their environmental friendliness.</description>

      <title>Cu&#8211;phen Coordination Enabled Selective Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to Methane</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c02810</link>

                Manipulation of selectivity in the catalytic electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR) poses significant challenges due to inevitable structure reconstruction. One approach is to develop effective strategies for controlling reaction pathways to gain a deeper understanding of mechanisms in robust CO2RR systems. In this work, by precise introduction of 1,10-phenanthroline as a bidentate ligand modulator, the electronic property of the copper site was effectively regulated, thereby directing selectivity switch. By modification of [Cu3(btec)(OH)2]n, the use of [Cu2(btec)(phen)2]n&#183;(H2O)n achieved the selectivity switch from ethylene (faradaic efficiency (FE) = 41%, FEC2+ = 67%) to methane (FECH4 = 69%). Various in situ spectroscopic characterizations revealed that [Cu2(btec)(phen)2]n&#183;(H2O)n promoted the hydrogenation of *CO intermediates, leading to methane generation instead of dimerization to form C2+ products. Acting as a delocalized &#960;-conjugation scaffold, 1,10-phenanthroline in [Cu2(btec)(phen)2]n&#183;(H2O)n helps stabilize Cu&#948;+. This work presents a novel approach to regulate the coordination environment of active sites with the aim of selectively modulating the CO2RR.</description>

      <title>Mass transfer of CO2 gas pocket in the horizontal pipe flow</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2166/aqua.2024.326</link>
      <description>Linjiang Guo, Lei Fang, Pengcheng Li, Yiyi Ma, Aqua. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394807445

                Abstract The mass transfer from a stagnant CO2 gas pocket to the flowing water in a horizontal pipe was investigated experimentally, considering the application of pH adjustment by injecting gaseous CO2 for raw water in water treatment industries. In the experiments, the variation of the CO2 gas pocket volume and the corresponding pH values of the pipe flow with time under different conditions were recorded. The mass transfer coefficient of the CO2 gas pocket in the pipe flow was then calculated. The results showed that the injection of gaseous CO2 into the pipe flow could effectively adjust the pH. The volume of the CO2 gas pocket decreased exponentially. Different from most studies on bubble mass transfer, it was found that the ambient CO2 concentration could not be neglected in this study due to the large volume of the gas pocket and the restricted space in the pipe. The mass transfer coefficient increased with the increasing ratio of the CO2 injection rate to the water flow rate and exhibited a sharp reduction as the volume of the CO2 gas pocket decreased by about 80%. The outcomes of this paper can contribute to a better understanding of gas bubble mass transfer in pipe flows.</description>

      <title>Cost and CO2 emissions co-optimisation of green hydrogen production in a
  grid-connected renewable energy system</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2404.11995</link>
      <description>Sleiman Farah, Neeraj Dhanraj Bokde, Gorm Bruun Andresen, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394973486

                Green hydrogen is essential for producing renewable fuels that are needed in sectors that are hard to electrify directly. Hydrogen production in a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy plant necessitates smart planning to meet long-term hydrogen trading agreements while minimising costs and emissions. Previous research analysed economic and environmental impact of hydrogen production based on full foresight of renewable energy availabilty, electricity price, and CO2 intensity in the electricity grid. However, the full foresight assumption is impractical in day-to-day operation, often leading to underestimations of both the cost and CO2 emissions associated with hydrogen production. Therefore, this research introduces a novel long-term planner that uses historical data and short-term forecasts to plan hydrogen production in the day-to-day operation of a grid-connected hybrid renewable energy plant. The long-term planner co-minimises cost and CO2 emissions to determine the hydrogen production for the next day taking into account the remaining hydrogen production and the time remaining until the end of the delivery period, which can be a week, a month, or a year. Extended delivery periods provide operation flexibility, enabling cost and CO2 emissions reductions. Significant reductions in CO2 emissions can be achieved with relatively small increases in the levelised cost. Under day-to-day operation, the levelised cost of hydrogen is marginally higher than that of the full foresight; the CO2 emissions can be up to 60% higher. Despite a significant portion of the produced hydrogen not meeting the criteria for green hydrogen designation under current rules, CO2 emissions are lower than those from existing alternative hydrogen production methods. These results underscore the importance of balancing cost considerations with environmental impacts in operational decision-making.</description>

      <title>The CHEPA model: assessing the impact of HEPA filter units in classrooms
  using a fast-running coupled indoor air quality and dynamic thermal model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2404.10837</link>
      <description>Henry C. Burridge, Sen Liu, Sara Mohamed, Samuel G. A. Wood, Catherine Noakes, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394946938

                The quality of the classroom environment, including ventilation, air quality and thermal conditions, has an important impact on children's health and academic achievements. The use of portable HEPA filter air cleaners is widely suggested as a strategy to mitigate exposure to particulate matter and airborne viruses. However, there is a need to quantify the relative benefits of such devices including the impacts on energy use. We present a simple coupled dynamic thermal and air quality model and apply it to naturally ventilated classrooms, representative of modern and Victorian era construction. We consider the addition of HEPA filters with, and without, reduced opening of windows, and explore concentrations of carbon dioxide (\co), \PM, airborne viral RNA, classroom temperature and energy use. Results indicate the addition of HEPA filters was predicted to reduce \PM~ by 40--60\% and viral RNA by 30--50\% depending on the classroom design and window opening behaviour. The energy cost of running HEPA filters is likely to be only 1\%--2\% of the classroom heating costs. In scenarios when HEPA filters were on and window opening was reduced (to account for the additional clean air delivery rate of the filters), the heating cost was predicted to be reduced by as much as -13\%, and these maximum reductions grew to -46\% in wintertime simulations. In these scenarios the HEPA filters result in a notable reduction in \PM~and viral RNA, but the \co\ concentration is significantly higher. The model provides a mechanism for exploring the relative impact of ventilation and air cleaning strategies on both exposures and energy costs, enabling an understanding of where trade-offs lie.</description>

      <title>Biomass-based carbon aerogels with interconnected pores and controllable Zn-N sites for CO2 electroreduction</title>

                The rational design of renewable, highly active, and selective catalysts has always been the key to the practical application of CO2 electroreduction. In this study, biomass-based Zn/N doped carbon aerogels were fabricated for high-selectivity electrical reduction of CO2 to CO. After in situ Zn/N doping, carbon aerogels exhibited interconnected pores, high surface area, and exposed active sites, and their physicochemical properties are significantly affected by pyrolysis temperature. When the pyrolysis temperature increased to 950 &#176;C, the number of surface active sites and pore structure parameters of carbon aerogels decreased significantly due to the escape of zinc and nitrogen. CAZN-850 exhibited the highest specific surface area of 1317.0 m2/g and abundant Zn-N sites, which results in its high activity and selectivity for electroreduction of CO2 to CO (FECO = 89 % at -1.0V vs. RHE). Moreover, the stability test results for CO2RR showed that the reduction value of FECO for Zn/N doped carbon aerogels was only 5% under long-time operation. This work provides a new idea for the design of biomass-based catalysts for CO2 electroreduction.</description>

                Single atom metal-nitrogen-carbon materials have emerged as remarkably potent catalysts, demonstrating unprecedented potential for the photo-driven reduction of CO2. Herein, a unique Cu@g-C3N5 catalyst obtained by cooperation of single atom Cu and nitrogen-rich g-C3N5 is proposed. The particular CuN diatomic active sites (DAS) in Cu@g-C3N5 contribute to the formation of highly stable CuOCN adsorption, a key configuration for CO2 activation and CC coupling. The synergistic diatomic active sites interaction is found responsible for the efficient photoreduction of CO2 to C2H4 which has been demonstrated in our Gibbs free energy calculation and COHP analysis. The CO2 activation mechanism was studied, the charge density difference and DOS analysis show that the low oxidation state Cu atom significantly affects the electronic structure of g-C3N5 and then enhance the catalytic activity of CO2 hydrogenation.</description>

      <title>Analysis of environmental impact reduction effects of unclassified thermoplastic waste recycling</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.62765/kjlca.2022.23.1.31</link>
      <description>Jong-Hyo Lee, Yong Woo Hwang, Doo Young Kim, Young Su Park, Korean Journal of Life Cycle Assessment. 23(1)] 2022. https://openalex.org/W4394814578

                This study conducted the environmental load comparative analysis between unclassified thermoplastic wastes incineration/landfill and recycled thermoplastic blocks manufacturing with considering the avoided burden effects of concrete bricks manufacturing by using the LCA methodology and quantitatively calculated the environmental advantages of recycling unclassified thermoplastic blocks manufacturing. As a result of the environmental impact assessment of the recycling unclassified thermoplastic blocks manufacturing, ODP was decreased by 1.49E-05 kg CFC-11-eq./unit, and the reduction ratio was 99.95% which implies removing most of all environmental impact. POCP also decreased by 1.64E+00 kg C2H4-eq./unit, and the reduction ratio was 99.88%. AP also was decreased by 2.30E+01 kg SO2-eq./unit, and the reduction ratio was 97.92%. EP also was decreased by 2.79E+00 kg PO43--eq./unit and the reduction ratio was 96.86%. The reduced amount of GWP also was 1.49E+03 kg CO2-eq./unit and the reduction ratio was 83.77%. But, ADP was decreased by 1.92E-01 kg Sb-eq./unit and the reduction ratio was 15.09% which is the least reduction effect among the six environmental impact categories. The results of this study imply that recycling unclassified thermoplastic wastes can eliminate most of all environmental impacts in the four categories (ODP, POCP, AP, and EP) compared to thermoplastic waste incineration/landfill. In particular, the reduction of CO2 emission can be visualized at the same level as the amount of annual greenhouse gas absorption of 634 pine trees or 421 oak trees. The implications derived from this study have a clear purpose as macroscopic basis data for the necessity of recycling waste thermoplastics and business strategy, and this suggests the possibility of derivative research through a more sophisticated data collection process in future research.</description>

                Microbial CO2 fixation into lactic acid (LA) is an important approach for low-carbon biomanufacturing. Engineering microbes to utilize CO2 and sugar as co-substrates can create efficient pathways through input of moderate reducing power to drive CO2 fixation into product. However, to achieve complete conservation of organic carbon, how to engineer the CO2-fixing modules compatible with native central metabolism and merge the processes for improving bioproduction of LA is a big challenge. In this study, we designed and constructed a solar formic acid/pentose (SFAP) pathway in Escherichia coli, which enabled CO2 fixation merging into sugar catabolism to produce LA. In the SFAP pathway, adequate reducing equivalents from formate oxidation drive glucose metabolism shifting from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway. The Rubisco-based CO2 fixation and sequential reduction of C3 intermediates are conducted to produce LA stoichiometrically. CO2 fixation theoretically can bring a 20% increase of LA production compared with sole glucose feedstock. This SFAP pathway in the integration of photoelectrochemical cell and an engineered Escherichia coli opens an efficient way for fixing CO2 into value-added bioproducts.</description>

                Effectively utilizing low-grade thermal energy is a promising approach to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions while reducing the burden on centralized power grids. Current thermoacoustic heat pumps and power generators face challenges such as high onset temperature differentials and low performance. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a gas-liquid resonator into a thermoacoustic combined heat and power systems to recover low-grade thermal energy in residential buildings. Through Sage modeling and calculations, the internal characteristics of the proposed system and its output performance under different operating conditions are explored. At a heating temperature of 350 &#176;C, the system can generate 6.4 kW of output thermal power, 0.9 kW of electricity, and overall exergy efficiency is 79.3%. Combining neural network models with case studies conducted in Spain and Finland, the system can annually save 5.6 MWh and 20.7 MWh in fuel energy, reduce emissions of 1374 kg and 5180 kg of carbon dioxide, and save a total cost of &#8364;611 and &#8364;2324, respectively. Furthermore, comparisons with other emerging micro-CHP systems highlight the efficiency of the proposed system. These results indicate the high potential of thermoacoustic combined heat and power systems in recovering low-grade thermal energy and achieving energy savings and emission reductions.</description>

      <title>Rewetting of Disused Drained Peatlands and Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.31857/s258755662304012x</link>
      <description>Andrey Sirin, &#1052;. &#1042;. &#1052;&#1077;&#1076;&#1074;&#1077;&#1076;&#1077;&#1074;&#1072;, Victor Itkin, Izvesti&#226; Rossijskoj akademii nauk. Seri&#226; geografi&#269;eska&#226;. 87(4)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4394941095

                Drained peatlands are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. When abandoned, they become the most likely sites of peat fires. An effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent peatland fires in disused drained peatlands is through rewetting and wetland restoration. These can make significant contributions to the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement within the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry sector and, ultimately, to climate change mitigation. An approach for estimating greenhouse gas emission reductions following rewetting, applicable to national and regional accounting, as well as to specific rewetting projects, is presented. It includes a methodology for determining effectively rewetted areas that can be considered wetlands, the application of IPCC greenhouse gas emission factors to said sites, and an uncertainty assessment. Starting from 2020 the Russian Federation National Report of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gasses not controlled by the Montreal Protocol utilised this approach in its inclusion of rewetted peatlands. An assessment of greenhouse gas emission reductions is presented using the example of a 1500 ha section of a peatland within the Fire Hazardous Peatland Rewetting Programme in Moscow Oblast (2010&#8211;2013). CO2 emission reductions were cumulatively 33.4 thous. t by 2022 (taking into account nitrous oxide fluxes, dissolved organic carbon removal and increased CH4 emissions&#8212;20 thous. t CO2-eq.) and are projected to reach almost 113 (68) thous. t by 2050. Greenhouse gas emission reductions not yet included as well as possible ways of accounting for them in the future are also noted.</description>

      <title>Application of Lattice Boltzmann Approach for Teaching a Rock Mass Seepage Mechanics Course</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos15040496</link>

                The technology of CO2 geological storage and CH4 intensive mining (CO2-ECBM) in coal seams integrates greenhouse gas emission reduction and new fossil energy development and has great development prospects. The CO2 injection, CO2 sequestration mechanism and storage capacity, and CH4 stimulation effect constitute the core content of the effectiveness of CO2-ECBM, among which CO2 injection is the most critical. Traditional seepage analysis methods often struggle to tackle flow-related issues influenced by microscale effects and intricate channels. This paper highlights the advantages of employing lattice Boltzmann (LBM) numerical simulations to study CO2 seepage behaviors when teaching a Rock Mass Seepage Mechanics Course. This course primarily covers topics such as the pore structure of rock, unstable liquid seepage, gas seepage theory and related subjects. Its goal is to provide students with a solid theoretical foundation to address the complexities of fluid seepage in pours media encountered in practical scenarios. A novel LBM-based methodology was employed to estimate the CO2 seepage capacity by incorporating the effects of different concentrations of [Bmin]Cl solution (0 wt%, 1 wt%, 3 wt%, and 5 wt%). The CO2 velocity distribution cloud map of each coal sample was simulated; the average velocity distribution curve of each coal sample was obtained; and the velocity profile of the seepage channel of each coal sample was described. This study can provide theoretical guidance for the technology of CO2 geological storage and CH4 intensive mining in coal seams.</description>

                Integrated CO2 capture and utilization by reverse water gas shift (ICCU-RWGS) reaction for syngas production for C1 chemical industry has gained increasing attention. Designing highly active bifunctional materials that enables CO2 adsorption and in-situ conversion is essential. In this work, Ni-Na2ZrO3 bifunctional materials are prepared by different synthetic methods for ICCU-RWGS. N2 physisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (CO2-TPD) and H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis reveals that Ni-Na2ZrO3-CP prepared by the co-precipitation (CP) method shows small Ni crystalline size, moderate surface basicity, and excellent reducibility. ICCU-RWGS performance is investigated under isothermal conditions of 650 &#176;C, 10 %CO2 and 35 %H2. The results indicate that Ni-Na2ZrO3-CP demonstrates excellent performance in ICCU-RWGS, with a notable CO2 capture capacity of 3.76 mmol CO2/g and a CO production rate of 3.10 mmol CO/g. Additionally, it exhibits relatively good operational stability. Detailed reaction paths of the ICCU-RWGS procedure for the Ni-Na2ZrO3 bifunctional materials are proposed. The findings will shed new perspectives on the design of synthetic bifunctional catalysts for ICCU-RWGS.</description>

      <title>Multiscale modeling of CO2 capture in dicationic ionic liquids: Evaluating the influence of hydroxyl groups using DFT-IR, COSMO-RS, and MD simulation methods</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0195668</link>
      <description>Mehrangiz Torkzadeh, Majid Moosavi, Journal of chemical physics online/&#152;The &#156;Journal of chemical physics/Journal of chemical physics. 160(15)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394853869

                This work employs a combination of density functional theory-infrared (IR), conductor-like screening model for real solvents (COSMO-RS), and molecular dynamic (MD) methods to investigate the impact of hydroxyl functional groups on CO2 capture within dicationic ionic liquids (DILs). The COSMO-RS reveals that hydroxyl groups in DILs reduce the macroscopic solubility of CO2 but improve the selectivity of CO2 over CO, H2, and CH4 gases. Quantum methods in the gas phase and MD simulations in the liquid phase were conducted to delve deeper into the underlying mechanisms. The IR spectrum analysis confirms red shifts in CO2's asymmetric stretching mode and blue shifts in the CR-HR bond of the dication, indicating CO2-DIL interactions and the weakening of the anion-cation interactions caused by the presence of CO2. The results show that the positioning of anions around hydroxyl groups and HR atoms in rings inhibits the proximity of CO2 molecules, causing the hydrogen atoms within methylene groups to accumulate CO2. van der Waals forces were found to dominate the interaction between ions and CO2. The addition of hydroxyl groups strengthens the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds between dications and anions. The stronger interaction energy between ions in [C5(mim)2-(C2)2(OH)2][NTf2]2 limits the displacement of CO2 molecules within this DIL compared to [C5(mim)2-(C4)2][NTf2]2. Compared to [C5(mim)2-(C4)2][NTf2]2, [C5(mim)2-(C2)2(OH)2][NTf2]2 exhibits stronger ion-ion interactions, higher density, and reduced free volume, resulting in a reduction in CO2 capture. These results provide significant insights into the intermolecular interactions and vibrational properties of CO2 in DIL complexes, emphasizing their significance in developing efficient and sustainable strategies for CO2 capture.</description>

                Nanoparticle organic hybrid materials (NOHMs) have been proposed as excellent electrolytes for combined CO2 capture and electrochemical conversion due to their conductive nature and chemical tunability. However, CO2 capture behavior and transport properties of these electrolytes after CO2 capture have not yet been studied. Here, we use a variety of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques to explore the carbon speciation and transport properties of branched polyethylenimine (PEI) and PEI-grafted silica nanoparticles (denoted as NOHM-I-PEI) after CO2 capture. Quantitative 13C NMR spectra collected at variable temperatures reveal that absorbed CO2 exists as carbamates (RHNCOO- or RR'NCOO-) and carbonate/bicarbonate (CO32-/HCO3-). The transport properties of PEI and NOHM-I-PEI studied using 1H pulsed-field-gradient NMR, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, demonstrate that coulombic interactions between negatively and positively charged chains dominate in PEI, while the self-diffusion in NOHM-I-PEI is dominated by silica nanoparticles. These results provide strategies for selecting adsorbed forms of carbon for electrochemical reduction.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Characterization of Electrodeposited Copper in Amine CO2 Capture Media</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17081825</link>
      <description>Corentin Penot, Kranthi Kumar Maniam, Shiladitya Paul, Materials. 17(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394836903

                This study explores the stability of electrodeposited copper catalysts utilized in electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) across various amine media. The focus is on understanding the influence of different amine types, corrosion ramifications, and the efficacy of pulse ECR methodologies. Employing a suite of electrochemical techniques including potentiodynamic polarization, linear resistance polarization, cyclic voltammetry, and chronopotentiometry, the investigation reveals useful insights. The findings show that among the tested amines, CO2-rich monoethanolamine (MEA) exhibits the highest corrosion rate. However, in most cases, the rates remain within tolerable limits for ECR operations. Primary amines, notably monoethanolamine (MEA), show enhanced compatibility with ECR processes, attributable to their resistance against carbonate salt precipitation and sustained stability over extended durations. Conversely, tertiary amines such as methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) present challenges due to the formation of carbonate salts during ECR, impeding their effective utilization. This study highlights the effectiveness of pulse ECR strategies in stabilizing ECR. A noticeable shift in cathodic potential and reduced deposit formation on the catalyst surface through periodic oxidation underscores the efficacy of such strategies. These findings offer insights for optimizing ECR in amine media, thereby providing promising pathways for advancements in CO2 emission reduction technologies.</description>

                The large-scale use of fossil fuels leads to the rising concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, which leads to serious environmental problem. In order to alleviate this problem, it is an effective way to convert CO2 to C1 (such as CO, CH4, CH3OH, formic acid and formate) as high value-added products, so as to make full use of carbon resources. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) is the use of renewable energy to reduce CO2 to valuable C1 products by using CO2 and H2O as raw materials. It has the advantages of low energy consumption, mild reaction conditions and no pollution, which has attracted wide attention in recent years. In this review, we firstly describe the basic principle, performance evaluation parameters and reaction devices of CO2RR, summarize the preparation methods of working electrodes, enumerate the types and application scenarios of commonly used electrolytes, as well as electrochemical test parameters and common product analysis methods. Then, we systematically summarize the research progress of CO2 electroreduction catalysts, including the application of single-atom catalysts, dual-atom catalysts and nano-porous metal catalysts in CO2RR, overview the design, preparation and characterization methods of CO2 electroreduction catalysts, and the structure and synthesis methods of various catalysts in detail. Finally, the C1 products generated by CO2RR, such as CO, CH4, CH3OH, formic acid and formate, are discussed, and the effects of catalysts with different structures on the products selectivity are analyzed.</description>

      <title>Tandem Acidic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electrolysis Coupled with Syngas Fermentation: A Two-Stage Process for Producing Medium-Chain Fatty Acids</title>

                The tandem application of CO2 electrolysis with syngas fermentation holds promise for achieving heightened production rates and improved product quality. However, the significant impact of syngas composition on mixed culture-based microbial chain elongation remains unclear. Additionally, effective methods for generating syngas with an adjustable composition from acidic CO2 electrolysis are currently lacking. This study successfully demonstrated the production of medium-chain fatty acids from CO2 through tandem acidic electrolysis with syngas fermentation. CO could serve as the sole energy source or as the electron donor (when cofed with acetate) for caproate generation. Furthermore, the results of gas diffusion electrode structure engineering highlighted that the use of carbon black, either alone or in combination with graphite, enabled consistent syngas generation with an adjustable composition from acidic CO2 electrolysis (pH 1). The carbon black layer significantly improved the CO selectivity, increasing from 0% to 43.5% (0.05 M K+) and further to 92.4% (0.5 M K+). This enhancement in performance was attributed to the promotion of K+ accumulation, stabilizing catalytically active sites, rather than creating a localized alkaline environment for CO2-to-CO conversion. This research contributes to the advancement of hybrid technology for sustainable CO2 reduction and chemical production.</description>

      <title>A thorough assessment of mineral carbonation of steel slag and refractory waste</title>

Gallo Stampino, Francesc Gispert&#8208;Guirado, Anna Casals-Terr&#233;, Stefano Giancola, Jos&#233; Ram&#243;n Gal&#225;n&#8208;Mascar&#243;s, Journal of CO2 utilization. 82(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394894299

                Escalating industrial CO2 emissions necessitate innovative carbon capture and utilization strategies. This study explores the potential of mineral-carbonation of steelmaking slags, particularly White Slag (WS) and various Refractory Wastes (RWs), to mitigate CO2 emissions and valorize industrial wastes. Experiments were performed with waste materials from the production lines at CELSA (Barcelona, Spain). We delved into direct aqueous carbonation, evaluating the performance and characteristics of these wastes under different experimental conditions. Our findings reveal that all slags can effectively sequester CO2. This process is effective not only for pure CO2 but also for diluted flue gases under mild conditions (&#8804; 100 &#186;C, &#8804; 6 bar). Specifically, WS exhibited peak CO2 sequestration capacities (SC) of 359.79 gCO2/kgslag (pure CO2) and 276.65 gCO2/kgslag (diluted flue gas). In contrast, the RWs presented different kinetic, reaching a maximum SC of 311 gCO2/kgslag after prolonged times. Given the large inhomogeneity of RWs, individual analysis of distinct RW fractions revealed significant variations in carbonation performance. Tundish RW exhibited the highest CO2 sequestration capacity, emphasizing the importance of waste source and mineral composition in the carbonation. Chemical and morphological evaluations confirmed the transformation of CaO to CaCO3, with MgO remaining largely inert. Additionally, the process indicated potential environmental benefits by reducing the mobility of toxic metals, particularly Pb, suggesting an ancillary avenue for waste treatment. This study underscores the utility of CO2 mineralization as a dual-benefit approach within the circular economy framework, offering insights into its application for sustainable waste management and CO2 emission reduction in the steel industry.</description>

      <title>Projecting Global Mercury Emissions and Deposition Under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2023ef004231</link>
      <description>Benjamin M. Geyman, David G. Streets, Colin P. Thackray, Christine M. Olson, Kevin Schaefer, Elsie M. Sunderland, Earth's future. 12(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394858214

                Abstract Mercury (Hg) is a naturally occurring element that has been greatly enriched in the environment by human activities like mining and fossil fuel combustion. Despite commonalities in some carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and Hg emission sources, the implications of long&#8208;range climate scenarios for anthropogenic Hg emissions have yet to be explored. Here, we present comprehensive projections of anthropogenic Hg emissions extending to the year 2300 and evaluate impacts on global atmospheric Hg deposition. Projections are based on four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) ranging from sustainable reductions in resource and energy intensity to rapid economic growth driven by abundant fossil fuel exploitation. There is a greater than two&#8208;fold difference in cumulative anthropogenic Hg emissions between the lower&#8208;bound (110 Gg) and upper&#8208;bound (235 Gg) scenarios. Hg releases to land and water are approximately six times those of direct emissions to air (600&#8211;1,470 Gg). At their peak, anthropogenic Hg emissions reach 2,200&#8211;2,600 Mg a &#8722;1 sometime between 2010 (baseline) and 2030, depending on the SSP scenario. Coal combustion is the largest determinant of differences in Hg emissions among scenarios. Decoupling of Hg and CO 2 emission sources occurs under low&#8208;to mid&#8208;range scenarios, though contributions from artisanal and small&#8208;scale gold mining remain uncertain. Future Hg emissions may have lower gaseous elemental Hg (Hg 0 ) and higher divalent Hg (Hg II ), resulting in a higher fraction of locally sourced Hg deposition. Projected reemissions of previously deposited anthropogenic Hg follow a similar temporal trajectory to primary emissions, amplifying the benefits of primary Hg emission reductions under the most stringent mitigation scenarios.</description>

                In the framework of the RECCAP2 initiative, we present the greenhouse gas (GHG) and carbon (C) budget of Europe. For the decade of the 2010s, we present a bottom-up (BU) estimate of GHG net-emissions of 3.9 Pg CO2-eq. yr-1 (global warming potential on 100 year horizon), and are largely dominated by fossil fuel emissions. In this decade, terrestrial ecosystems are a net GHG sink of 0.9 Pg CO2-eq. yr-1, dominated by a CO2 sink. For CH4 and N2O, we find good agreement between BU and top-down (TD) estimates from atmospheric inversions. However, our BU land CO2 sink is significantly higher than TD estimates. We further show that decadal averages of GHG net-emissions have declined by 1.2 Pg CO2-eq. yr-1 since the 1990s, mainly due to a reduction in fossil fuel emissions. In addition, based on both data driven BU and TD estimates, we also find that the land CO2 sink has weakened over the past two decades. In particular, we identified a decreasing sink strength over Scandinavia, which can be attributed to an intensification of forest management. These are partly offset by increasing CO2 sinks in parts of Eastern Europe and Northern Spain, attributed in part to land use change. Extensive regions of high CH4 and N2O emissions are mainly attributed to agricultural activities and are found in Belgium, the Netherlands and the southern UK. We further analyzed interannual variability in the GHG budgets. The drought year of 2003 shows the highest net-emissions of CO2 and of all GHGs combined.</description>

                The rapid development of society and economy has resulted in a substantial increase in energy consumption, consequently exacerbating pollution issues. Current research predominantly focuses on energy-saving and emission reduction in road transportation within individual cities or the three major economic regions of China:the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region. However, there is a dearth of studies addressing the southeastern coastal economic region. Located at the heart of China's southeastern coastal economic development, the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang unavoidably face challenges associated with energy consumption and emissions while pursuing economic growth. To address these challenges, this study employed a LEAP model to construct various scenarios for road transportation in the key coastal cities of Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang from 2015 to 2035. These scenarios included a baseline scenario (BAU), an existing policy scenario (EPS), and an improved policy scenario (MPS). The MPS and EPS encompassed vehicle structure optimization (VSO), improved fuel economy (IFE), and reduced annual average mileage (RDM). By simulating and evaluating these scenarios, the energy-saving and emission reduction potentials of road transportation in the key coastal cities were assessed. The results indicated that, in the primary scenario, the MPS exhibited the most significant improvements in energy-saving, carbon reduction, and pollutant reduction effects. By 2035, the MPS achieved a remarkable 75% energy-saving rate compared to that in the baseline scenario, accompanied by reductions of 68%, 59%, 66%, 70%, and 64% in CO2, CO, NOx, PM2.5, and SO2 emissions, respectively. In the secondary scenario, the improved scenario of enhancing fuel economy achieved a notable 30% reduction in energy consumption. Additionally, the scenarios involving vehicle structure adjustment (yielding reductions of 36%, 30%, 36%, 26%, and 40%) and annual average mileage reduction (resulting in reductions of 37%, 37%, 36%, 37%, and 36%) demonstrated significant reductions in CO2, CO, NOx, PM2.5, and SO2 emissions.</description>

                Recently, global-scale efforts have been conducted for the electroreduction of CO2 as a potentially beneficial pathway for the conversion of greenhouse gases to useful chemicals and renewable fuels. This study focuses on the development of selective and sustainable electrocatalysts for the reduction of aqueous CO2 to CO. A RuIIcomplex [Ru(tptz)(ACN)Cl2] (RCMP) (tptz = 2,4,6-tris(2-pyridyl)-1,3,5-triazine, ACN = acetonitrile) was prepared as a molecular electrocatalyst for the CO2 reduction reaction in an aqueous solution. Density functional theory-calculated frontier molecular orbitals suggested that the tptz ligand plays a key role in dictating the electrocatalytic reactions. The RCMP electrocatalyst was grafted onto the graphene oxide (GO) surface both noncovalently (GO/RCMP) and covalently (GO-RCMP). The field emission scanning electron microscopy and elemental distribution analyses revealed the homogeneous distribution of the complex onto the GO sheet. The photoluminescence spectra confirmed accelerated charge-transfer in both nanohybrids. Compared to the bare complex, the GO-RCMP and GO/RCMP nanohybrids showed enhanced electrocatalytic activity, achieving &gt;95% and 90% Faradaic efficiencies for CO production at more positive onset potentials, respectively. The GO-RCMP nanohybrid demonstrated outstanding electrocatalytic activity with a current of &#8764;84 &#956;A. The study offers a perspective on outer- and inner-sphere electron-transfer mechanisms for electrochemical energy conversion systems.</description>

                Photoelectrochemistry (PEC) has emerged as a promising field for solar energy conversion, water splitting, CO2 reduction, and environmental remediation. Various modification methods have been developed to enhance PEC performance, with single-atomic catalysts (SACs) gaining attention for their potential to improve efficiency. SACs consist of isolated metal atoms dispersed on a support material, providing high atom utilization efficiency and well-defined active sites. Incorporating SACs into photoelectrodes has shown significant improvements in charge carrier dynamics and catalytic activity. This review comprehensively analyzes recent advancements in PEC, focusing on the role of SACs in standalone photoanodes, photocathodes, and dual-function photoelectrodes. It explores their impact on water splitting, CO2 reduction, pollutant degradation, detection, and sensing. This comprehensive review paper provides a valuable resource for researchers in the field of PEC by addressing existing gaps and incorporating the latest research progress. With its up-to-date analysis and comprehensive coverage, this review also contributes to the development of efficient and sustainable PEC devices.</description>

      <title>Predicting Geologic CO2 Storage and Plume Evolution from Sparsely Available Well Data Using Barlow Twins</title>

                Summary Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an important practice for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. However, accurately monitoring carbon storage operations using simulations can be challenging due to data availability, subsurface complexity, uncertainty, and computational cost. Machine learning can help to address these challenges by providing cheaper data-driven approaches. For instance, Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CCGAN) can be used to predict CO2 plume propagation with sparsely available data. This model enables fast prediction with reasonable accuracy and a substantial reduction in computational cost when compared to numerical simulations. Another approach, Barlow Twins (BT), provides better results than other deep learning-based approaches and comparable results to traditional methods for linear subspace and nonlinear manifold problems. In this work, we compare the accuracy of predictions of CO2 plume propagation based on data from three well locations using a BT-based approach to those obtained with the CCGAN. Our findings suggest that BT-based approaches could be a viable option for data-driven simulation of CO2 plume propagation in the subsurface when data is limited.</description>

      <title>CO\(_2\) and Climate Change: Unveiling the Missing Experimental Evidence</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.9734/ijecc/2024/v14i44124</link>
      <description>Andrej Pusti&#353;ek, International Journal of Environment and Climate Change. 14(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394924486

                Human activities releasing greenhouse gases are identified as dominant contributors to the observed climate change including global warming and its acceleration. The consequences for humanity are predicted to be severe. Therefore, to mitigate global warming, significant efforts are being devoted to reducing CO2 emissions and stabilizing (or even reducing) atmospheric CO2 concentration. This enormous endeavor of &#8216;decarbonization&#8217; comes with substantial costs, running into trillions of USD in Western countries alone.
 Fundamentally, the entirety of endeavors, actions, and outcomes hinges upon the central hypothesis stating that the increase of CO2 concentration from approximately 0.03% to more than 0.04% causes a noticeable temperature rise. Given the paramount significance of this hypothesis, the generally accepted rules of science would necessitate rigorous scrutiny for substantiation. Such substantiation is typically provided by an experimental evidence.
 Yet, surprisingly according to the results of this research, exactly this essential experimental evidence supporting the central hypothesis seems to be lacking, not fully adhering to fundamental principles of scientific analysis. Consequently, robust experimental evidence must be presented to substantiate the hypothesis, as the failure to do so would necessitate a reassessment of the emphasis on CO2 emissions reduction as the primary solution to climate change.</description>

      <title>Supercritical carbon dioxide technology in food processing: Insightful comprehension of the mechanisms of microbial inactivation and impacts on quality and safety aspects</title>

                Abstract Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC&#8208;CO 2 ) has emerged as a nonthermal technology to guarantee food safety. This review addresses the potential of SC&#8208;CO 2 technology in food preservation, discussing the microbial inactivation mechanisms and the impact on food products&#8217; quality parameters and bioactive compounds. Furthermore, the main advantages and gaps are denoted. SC&#8208;CO 2 technology application causes adequate microbial reductions (&gt;5 log cfu/mL) of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms, enzyme inactivation, and improvements in the storage stability in fruit and vegetable products (mainly fruit juices), meat products, and dairy derivatives. SC&#8208;CO 2 &#8208;treated products maintain the physicochemical, technological, and sensory properties, bioactive compound concentrations, and biological activity (antioxidant and angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme&#8211;inhibitory activities) similar to the untreated products. The optimization of processing parameters (temperature, pressure, CO 2 volume, and processing times) is mandatory for achieving the desired results. Further studies should consider the expansion to different food matrices, shelf&#8208;life evaluation, bioaccessibility of bioactive compounds, and in vitro and in vivo studies to prove the benefits of using SC&#8208;CO 2 technology. Moreover, the impact on sensory characteristics and, mainly, the consumer perception of SC&#8208;CO 2 &#8208;treated foods need to be elucidated. We highlight the opportunity for studies in postbiotic production. In conclusion, SC&#8208;CO 2 technology may be used for microbial inactivation to ensure food safety without losing the quality parameters.</description>

                Exploring high-efficiency photocatalysts for selective CO2 reduction is still challenging because of the limited charge separation and surface reactions. In this study, a noble-metal-free metallic VSe2 nanosheet was incorporated on g-C3N4 to serve as an electron capture and transfer center, activating surface active sites for highly efficient and selective CO2 photoreduction. Quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy (sXAS), and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS) unveiled that VSe2 could capture electrons, which are further transferred to the surface for activating active sites. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a kinetically feasible process for the formation of a key intermediate and confirmed the favorable production of CO on the VSe2/PCN (protonated C3N4) photocatalyst. As an outcome, the optimized VSe2/PCN composite achieved 97% selectivity for solar-light-driven CO2 conversion to CO with a high rate of 16.3 &#956;mol&#183;g-1&#183;h-1, without any sacrificial reagent or photosensitizer. This work offers new insights into the photocatalyst design toward highly efficient and selective CO2 conversion.</description>

                The study for Carbon Footprint of inorganic fertilizers have been proceeding since 2010, this year the results of customized fertilizer devised. Customized fertilizer to be considered soli testing and nutrient balance, fertilizers are produced by the formulation at main ingredient (N-P-K). There are currently being produced 30 products. In case of Korea, nitrogen balance and the usage of chemical fertilizers are higher than in OECD countries, excessive use of fertilizers can be a problem. Accordingly, the government has been encourages the use of customized fertilizer. In this study estimate the carbon footprint for 1 kg production of customized fertilizer, No. 16 by using LCA. In addition, the carbon footprint were compared customized fertilizer with single fertilizer. The carbon footprint of No. 16 was 8.00E-01 kg CO2 eq. kg-1. Next, customized fertilizer were analyzed 12.12% low-carbon than 9.11E-01 kg CO2 eq. kg-1 for single fertilizer when compared carbon footprint for customized fertilizer and single fertilizer. These results will be considered contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions in agricultural sector.</description>

      <title>Marginal abatement cost of CO2: a convex quantile non-radial directional distance function regression method considering noise and inefficiency</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2024.131323</link>
      <description>Shuo Hu, Ailun Wang, Boqiang Lin, Energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394893400

                By purchasing emission reduction equipment or reducing production scale, it is possible to effectively decrease CO2. Therefore, understanding the marginal abatement cost (MAC) associated with these methods is crucial for making decisions. However, previous studies using the directional distance function (DDF) approach often mis-specified production functions and neglected data noise. They also assumed decision-making units (DMUs) to be on the production frontier and used proportional changes in inputs and outputs as abatement paths. This paper addresses these limitations by developing the convex quantile non-radial directional distance function (CQR-NDDF) method, which estimates the MAC of CO2 and determines optimal abatement paths for DMUs without assuming a specific production function, employing linear programming techniques. Applying this method to 30 provinces in mainland China from 2011 to 2019, the study finds that China's CO2 MAC increased from 182 to 247 yuan/ton. The lowest-cost abatement path varies by province and time. The club convergence and ordered probit model are employed to conclude that the second industry and urbanization increase the MAC of CO2, while factors such as foreign direct investment, openness level, and human capital decrease the MAC. Moreover, the CQR-NDDF method yields significantly lower MAC estimates than the NDDF method. In conclusion, this paper provides new insights into China's CO2 MAC, emphasizing the importance of considering inefficiency and data noise in MAC estimation. We anticipate that utilizing CO2 MAC as a benchmark for carbon trading market prices could lead to an increase in prices within China's carbon trading market.</description>

                In this study, an HIA (Heath impact assessment) model is developed to study the health and economic impacts of the electrification of public transport in Delhi. Health impact functions are obtained from C-R (concentration-response) models developed on the basis of relative risk studies and other epidemiological research. Baseline data on the economic values of health impacts is obtained from the available studies. The intervention scenario is based on powering all DTC (Delhi Transport Corporation) buses by battery. The model results revealed a significant reduction of emission and related health and economic benefits. The expected reduction in annual mortality is estimated at 793 cases, which will be equivalent to annual savings of USD 515 M (million) as well as 0.491 million tons of reduction in CO2 emissions.</description>

                A greenhouse gas emission reduction effect of &#8220;Low-Carbon Products&#8221; which are the second scheme of Korean carbon footprint labeling has been analyzed from 2011 to 2015 in this study. The reduction effect is calculated by subtracting the low carbon product from the first carbon emission which shows the reduced emission value of product and then multiplying by the sales of the products. The total number of the low-carbon products is 231 and its estimated reducing GHG effect totals 3.44 Mt CO2-eq. This equals to an annual absorption of approximately 520 million 30 year old pine trees and an annual emission of about 1.43 million vehicles. In addition, it is evaluated that the cost effectiveness of a low carbon product labeling program is more than 50 times than that of carbon trading schemes in Korea. Both the government and companies should develope and apply various policies to invigorate the program of low carbon products.</description>

                A series of pure and 50% substituted Fe&#8208;containing (LaFeO3, LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3 and LaFe0.5Co0.5O3) and Co/Ni&#8208;containing (LaCoO3, LaNiO3, and LaCo0.5Ni0.5O3) perovskites were used as precursors to synthesize metallic reduced catalysts to be tested for the liquid hydrogenation of furfural. The catalytic reaction was carried out in a batch reactor at 200 &#176;C and 3.0 MPa of H2 pressure. The calcined perovskites and reduced catalysts were characterized by X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), N2 physisorption at 77 K, temperature programmed reduction (H2&#8208;TPR), temperature programmed CO2 and NH3 desorption (CO2&#8208;TPD and NH3&#8208;TPD), Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. The LaCo0.5Ni0.5O3 reduced catalyst display the highest activity in furfural conversion, which was attributed to a cooperative effect between highly dispersed nickel and cobalt metal nanoparticles after reduction process. The effect of the nature of B&#8208;cation have a high impact on the products selectivity in the hydrogenation of furfural, suggesting that enriched&#8208;Ni metal surface was selectivity to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, meanwhile enriched&#8208;Co metal surface was selective to furfuryl alcohol formation, which was also supported with adsorption mode of furfural over the active sites obtained by quantum calculation.</description>

                A novel hybrid energy system driven by torrefied biomass gasification and solar energy is proposed for the first time, and their complementarity to enhance the system's energy efficiency is analyzed and shown. The system mainly combines biomass torrefaction, biomass gasification subsystem, solar heat collection and absorption refrigeration technology. The effects of different operating parameters on the gasification products were studied. The economic analysis is carried out based on the theory of exergy economy. The results show that torrefaction pretreatment of biomass can significantly improve its fuel quality and gasification performance. With the increase of torrefied temperature, the volume fraction of CO2 and H2 decreased while the volume fraction of CH4 and CO increased. The economic analysis shows that the expected annual income is $72,735, and the investment recovery period is 2.89 years. Through the calculation of the energy-saving and environmental benefits, it can be concluded that the hybrid energy system can save 1.05 &#215; 106 MJ of heat per year. This equates to about 358.26 tons of standard coal or a CO2 emission reduction of 550.59 tons, the participation of solar energy is conducive to the system emission reduction. By tuning the parameter sensitivity, the influence of biomass price change on the unit exergy cost of system products was more obvious.</description>

      <description>Seongwon Im, Chang Kyu Lee, Om Prakash, Xueqing Shi, Eu Gene Chung, Eun Hye Na, Dong-Hoon Kim, Resources, conservation and recycling. 206(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394842868

                During manure storage (1&#8211;6 months), valuable nutrients and organic contents are degraded, emitting substantial amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and odors. Through the application of acidification and cooling-down, the less emissions during storage and beneficial outcomes in further treatment can be expected. However, there is a concern whether these storage technologies really deserve or not. In the present work, at first, a comprehensive review was conducted on (1) the amount of GHGs and odor emissions from manure, (2) the reduction in emitting gases by acidification and cooling-down with mechanisms behind them, and (3) its consequences on the increased biogas production and crop yield. Considering all these, an environmental and economic assessment was performed for three climatic regions (warm, temperate, and cool). It was found that H2SO4-acidification can reduce GHGs emissions by 12.6&#8211;97.2 kg CO2 eq/ton manure (&gt;75 % during the storage process), while the significant reduction was attained in warm region. And, except one case (cool, pH 5.5, and carbon price of 30 USD/kg CO2 eq.), the profit of 0.31&#8211;8.69 USD/ton manure was expected. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review addressing the importance of "keeping the freshness of manure" to save the planet and get more income.</description>

      <title>Highly defective NiFeV layered triple hydroxide with enhanced electrocatalytic activity and stability for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fmats.2024.1388695</link>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the most important components of various electrochemical systems such as water splitting, metal air batteries, and carbon dioxide reduction. However, the four-electron process of OER suffers from intrinsically sluggish kinetics, which contributes to significant overpotential in the electrochemical system. Herein, highly defective NiFeV layered triple hydroxide (LTH) catalyst was efficiently prepared using a one-step hydrothermal method. The crystal structure, electronic structure, and surface composition of NiFeV LTH were characterized by X-ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy. Moreover, NiFeV LTH demonstrated a superior OER catalytic performance with-low overpotential (158 mV @10 mA&#183;cm -2 ), related small Tafel slope (102.3 mV&#183;dec &#8722;1 ), and long-term stability at a high current density of 100 mA&#183;cm -2 . In situ Raman spectroscopy was applied to investigate the surface reconstruction during the OER process. It is revealed that Ni species were the most active sites at low overpotential, with the potential increasing subsequently Fe and V gradually participates in the catalytic reaction, the Fe and Ni species as OER catalytic active sites lead to the excellent OER catalytic activity of NiFeV LTH, and inhibited the further dissolution of high-valence NiOOH at high overpotential. The mechanism induced the outstanding activity and stability at high current densities in NiFeV LTH system. Dissolution of vanadium excited the active sites of NiFeV LTH synthesized by hydrothermal method which promoted both activity and stability, while the changes of surface species at different OER potentials were detected by in situ Raman spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Transient in situ DRIFTS investigation of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over unsupported CuGa catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202400539</link>

                Gallium oxide&#8208;based catalysts are promising candidates for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, whilst mechanistic understanding of the catalytic systems is not yet fully understood. Here, transient in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) studies of CO2 hydrogenation over the unsupported CuGa and CuGaN (with N doping) catalysts were conducted. The findings show that N doping could possibly promote the formation of surface Cu+ sites on the interface between Cu and Ga2O3, and hence increasing the selectivity to methanol. However, N doping prohibited the reduction of Ga2O3 to oxygen&#8208;deficient Ga2O3&#8208;x, which is unfavorable for CO2 conversion. Additionally, during DRIFTS the steady&#8208;state isotope transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) was performed (under H2/D2 isotopic switching conditions). The SSITKA results confirm that the Cu+&#8208;bound formates were likely the key intermediates for methanol synthesis over the catalyst, and the N doping could also weak the interaction between CO* species and the catalyst surface, and thus facilitating the selectivity towards methanol rather than CO. Findings of the work show that the partial nitridation of the metal oxides could be the strategy to promote methanol synthesis selectivity.</description>

A growing body of life cycle assessment (LCA) data desribes the environmental impact of healthcare processes. Objectives: To apply existing GHG emissions estimates to the bladder cancer pathway, To adapt GHG emissions data to accurately represent 2023 practice in the UK, To identify and quantify ways to reduce GHG emissions in England. METHODS: A scientific reference group comprised of healthcare environmental impact assessment experts was convened. Expert knowledge and literature review identified evidence describing ways to reduce GHG emissions across the bladder cancer care pathway, from referral to definitive treatment. Practice recommendations likely to result in equivalent or superior patient care, with lower GHG emissions, were made. Potential nationwide GHG emissions reductions were estimated based on incident numbers derived from Hospital Episode Statistics. RESULTS: Sixty eight recommendations were made. A national annual GHG emissions reduction of 3,690 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) was modelled as being possible if UK practice were optimised. This is equivalent to driving 17 million km in an average UK petrol car. The top 14 recommendations comprised 93% of modelled potential GHG emissions reductions, and are summarised in Table 1. CONCLUSIONS: Urology services can rapidly and substantially reduce GHG emissions associated with bladder cancer care, by adopting an array of pragmatic evidenced-based recommendations. Our approach to quantifying potential GHG emissions reductions allows healthcare services to be able to prioritise the most important adaptations. Replicating and implementing this approach internationally could yield substantial GHG eminssions reductions. Further LCA research and incorporation of circular economy principles into healthcare will continue to identify means of further GHG emissions reductions.

      <title>Efficient acidic CO2 electroreduction to formic acid by modulating electrode structure at industrial-level current</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.151238</link>
      <description>Zhenhui Wang, Hongdong Li, Dong Tian, Yun Geng, Xiaofeng Tian, Rui Chang, Jianping Lai, Shouhua Feng, Lei Wang, Chemical engineering journal. 489(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394794390

                Acidic CO2 electroreduction has the potential to synthesize low carbon footprint chemicals using renewable electricity. However, proton-rich environments can lead to strong hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and severe degradation of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance. Modulating electrode structure plays a critical role in improving the local microenvironment of CO2RR electrolytes. Here, by covering the catalyst layer with a hydrophobic silica aerosol layer, the surface of the catalyst is protected from corrosion, thereby increasing the efficiency and stability of the system. In the flow cell, the Sn-C/SiO2-3 catalyst has high formic acid (HCOOH) selectivity at high current density (&#8764;90 % at &#8722;400 mA cm&#8722;2). Importantly, the Sn-C/SiO2-3 catalyst can operate stably for 45 h at &#8722;400 mA cm&#8722;2. Combined in situ infrared analysis reveals that hydrophobic SiO2 aerosol layer can engineer the local microenvironment over the Sn-C catalyst surface by increasing the coverage of *OCHO to improve the CO2RR, which ultimately promotes high-efficiency CO2 conversion to HCOOH in strong acidic media. This surface coating strategy for adjusting the interface microenvironment can also be used for other electrocatalytic reactions.</description>

      <title>THE RIGHTS OF FUTURE GENERATIONS IN ITALIAN-EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL LAW</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5593/sgem2023v/4.2/s19.43</link>
      <description>Giovanna Di Benedetto, International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM .... None(None)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4394794977

                The work analyzes the rights of future generations in a perspective of solidarity within Italian-European environmental law, in a similar way to what was done in the German legal system. The analysis is conducted through a survey of the Italian-European regulatory framework, also with specific reference to the objectives of European social policies and through the jurisprudential comparative analysis with the legal system of the Federal Republic of Germany. In particular, with specific reference to a recent environmental dispute brought before the German Constitutional Court (Case Neubauer, et all v. Germany), within which the rights of future generations to live in a healthy environment are recognized. In the aforementioned case, the complainants allege that the German government has not introduced a legal framework sufficient to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and has not limited the increase in global temperature, according to the parameters agreed in the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015. The ruling of the German Constitutional Court is relevant since it considers it inadequate to achieve the objectives set by the international obligations on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions assumed by the federal law on climate protection of 2019. The aforementioned law is considered partly unconstitutional because it does not sufficiently protect people from future violations and limitations of the rights of freedom following the gradual intensification of climate change. In particular, in a perspective of solidarity, in a not local but global conception of the environment, with the recognition of the progressive and dangerous climate change, the German Constitutional Court notes that the German legislator has not distributed the CO2 emission balance proportionally and therefore, an adequate distribution of the sacrifice among current and future generations. In particular, the German Court writes: "one generation must not be allowed to consume large portions of the CO2 balance by supporting a relatively smaller share of the reduction effort, if this would leave subsequent generations with a drastic reduction burden and expose their lives to serious losses of liberty". The European and sometimes national regulatory framework still appears to be unsatisfactory with respect to the sustainable development objectives. So, the task of the national courts is that, as in the case of the German Constitutional Court, to evaluate the national regulatory provisions on climate protection, in the light of the principle of solidarity towards future generations, adopting an environmental approach that is not limited in time and in space but global.</description>

                A study is performed of cobalt/MgAl2O4 catalysts promoted with glucose at Co/C molar ratios of 16.5, 3.2, and 1.6 via sequential deposition and codeposition. Magnetometry and IR spectroscopy of adsorbed CO show that raising the content of carbon in the catalyst contributes to the reduction of cobalt, regardless of how Co is introduced. Infrared spectroscopy reveals the main adsorption sites are cobalt cations and metallic Co. A strong contribution from adsorption sites characteristic of large Co particles is observed in systems synthesized via codeposition. Adsorption sites attributed to Co2+ and Co&#948;+ are structurally more homogeneous than ones attributed to metallic Co.</description>

      <title>Secondary pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 patient: A case managed with VV-ECMO</title>

      <description>Gianlorenzo Golino, Edoardo Forin, Elisa Boni, Marina Martin, Guido Perbellini, Vittoria Rizzello, Anna Toniolo, Vinicio Danzi, IDCases. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394824191

                Air leak syndrome, including pneumomediastinum (PM), pneumopericardium, pneumothorax, or subcutaneous emphysema, is primarily caused by chest trauma, cardiothoracic surgery, esophageal perforation, and mechanical ventilation. Secondary pneumomediastinum (SP) is a rare complication, with a much lower incidence reported in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our patient was a 44-year-old nonsmoker male with a previous history of obesity (Body Mass Index [BMI] 35 kg/m2), hyperthyroidism, hypokinetic cardiopathy and atrial fibrillation in treatment with flecainide, who presented to the emergency department with 6 days of fever, cough, dyspnea, and respiratory distress. The COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed based on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). After initiation of mechanical ventilation, a chest computed tomography (CT) on the first day revealed bilateral multifocal ground-glass opacities, consolidation and an extensive SP and pneumoperitoneum. Our therapeutic strategy was initiation of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) as a bridge to recovery after positioning 2 drains (mediastinal and pleural), for both oxygenation and carbon dioxide clearance, to allow protective and ultra-protective ventilation to limit ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and the intensity of mechanical power for lung recovery. After another chest CT scan which showed a clear reduction of the PM, 2 pronation and neuromuscular relaxation cycles were also required, with improvement of gas exchange and respiratory mechanics. On the 15th day, lung function recovered and the patient was then weaned from VV-ECMO, and ultimately made a good recovery and was discharged. In conclusion, SP may be a reflection of extensive alveolar damage and should be considered as a potential predictive factor for adverse outcome in critically ill SARS-CoV2 patients.</description>

                Abstract The design of bifunctional electrocatalysts toward reduction reaction of carbon dioxide (ECO 2 RR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in aqueous rechargeable Zn&#9472;CO 2 batteries (ZABs) still poses a significant challenge. Herein, Ni clusters (Ni x ) of 0.5 and 0.8 nm in diameter coupled with single Ni site (Ni&#8722;N 4 &#8722;C), denoted as Ni&#8722;N 4 /Ni 5 and Ni&#8722;N 4 /Ni 8 , respectively, are synthesized and the size effect of Ni nanoclusters are studied. Ni&#8722;N 4 /Ni 5 exhibits an &#8776;100% Faradaic efficiency ( FE CO ) toward ECO 2 RR for CO from &#8722;0.4 to &#8722;0.8 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, superior to that of Ni&#8722;N 4 &#8722;C ( FE CO = 55.0%) and Ni&#8722;N 4 /Ni 8 ( FE CO = 80.0%). The OER performance of Ni&#8722;N 4 /Ni 5 and Ni&#8722;N 4 /Ni 8 are superior or comparable to that of commercial RuO 2 but outperform that of Ni&#8722;N 4 &#8722;C. Theoretical calculation indicates that * COOH of ECO 2 RR intermediates bond synergistically with Ni x clusters and Ni&#8722;N 4 &#8722;C single atom site, promoting the activation of CO 2 and reducing the energy barrier of the potential determining step of ECO 2 RR. Such effect is strongly size&#8208;dependent and larger Ni x nanoclusters result in too strong binding of * COOH intermediates, impede the formation of * CO. As a bifunctional cathode electrocatalyst of rechargeable alkaline aqueous ZABs, Ni&#8722;N 4 /Ni 5 exhibits a peak power density of 11.7 mW cm &#8722;2 and cycling durability over 1200 cycles and 420 h.</description>

                Two sets of Cu2+, and Co2+ complexes of two 4 &#8211; Pyridyl thiosemicarbazone derivatives ligands symbolized by (H3L1), and (H3L2), were synthesized and examined utilizing different analytical, and spectroscopic techniques such as (FT-IR, Elemental Analysis, Magnetic studies, PXRD, UV-Vis, and GC-MS). Thermal stability along with kinetic parameters of both Co2+ complexes were studied. 1H NMR technique was used to confirm the structures of both ligands. The proposed geometries of complexes were recognized by density function theory (DFT) calculations using Material software. Additionally, Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) topological analyses for both ligands were obtained using Multiwfn software. The cyclic voltammogram revealed that copper ions are electroactive and exhibited two reduction waves. Fluorescence studies for both ligands showed a direct increase in the intensity of emissions because of increasing Co2+ concentration in solution. Moreover, several biological evaluations were carried out for all six compounds to evaluate their potential use as biological agents, including antioxidant activity using 2,2&#8242;-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging approach, anti-microbial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans, DNA degradation activity, in addition to anticancer activity, along with molecular docking theoretical study against MCF-7 breast cancer cell line to determine the compounds ability to act as antitumor. It was found that the investigated compounds (especially the free ligands) have beneficial effects such as antimicrobial, antitumor, and DNA degradation agents. Furthermore, Co2+ complex (2) has the highest ABTS scavenging activity.</description>

                Metal hydride (MH) is an alloy that reversibly reacts with hydrogen gas and charges/discharges hydrogen into/from it. MH has some merits, such as low-pressure hydrogen storage, which can contribute to the abatement of environmental impacts, and high volumetric density, which can enhance the operation time per one charge. However, MH requires a long hydrogen charging time owing to the temperature increase caused by the exothermic reaction in its hydrogen-charging process. To address this problem, MH can be cooled to prevent the temperature increase during hydrogen charging. Thus, in this study, an MH cooling system using natural refrigerant GF-08 (MHG system) was investigated and compared with an MH cooling system using R410A (MHR system) and a conventional lithium-ion-battery-based energy storage system (Li-ion battery (LIB) system) in terms of the equivalent CO2 emission and charging time. It was determined that the CO2 reduction rate of the MHG system was 14.9% (MHR system) and 9.43% (LIB system). Moreover, by focusing on the charging time, it was found that the charging time of the LIB system was 10.3 times longer than those of the MHG and MHR systems. Therefore, MH cooling using GF-08 was proved to be effective at reducing both equivalent CO2 emissions and charging time compared to the MH cooling system using R410A and a lithium ion battery.</description>

                Herein, we report a phase-transformed fuel electrode to carry out the reversible CO&#8211;CO2 conversion in a reversible solid oxide electrochemical cell (RSOC), which is composed of self-assembled FeRu bimetallic nanoparticles and Ruddlesden-Popper Pr0.8Sr1.2Fe1&#8722;x&#8722;yRuxMoyO4 (FeRu@PSFRM). Electrochemical impedance spectra and their corresponding distribution of relaxation time demonstrate that the sub-electrode reaction process in the frequency ranging 100&#8211;102 Hz, including the gas adsorption, dissociation, and ionization reactions on the electrode surface, predominantly dominates the entire electrode reaction process. The single cell with the FeRu@PSFRM fuel electrode generates a maximum output power density of 170 W cm&#8722;2 at 800&#176;C in the solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) mode, while yields a current density of &#8722;0.256 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3 V in the solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) mode. In addition, the reliable reversible CO&#8211;CO2 mutual conversion has experienced "activation-stabilization-degradation" three obvious stages in the first 42-h SOFC-SOEC cycling testing. Fortunately, the degraded fuel electrode can be regenerated by oxidizing it in the oxidizing gas and then retreating in the reductive atmosphere. Our findings reveal that the FeRu@PSFRM material generated by the in-situ exsolution technique is a promising fuel electrode candidate for efficient and durable mutual CO&#8211;CO2 conversion in a RSOC.</description>

      <title>[Life Cycle Carbon Reduction Benefits of Electric Heavy-duty Truck to Replace Diesel Heavy-duty Truck].</title>

                To accurately predict the life-cycle carbon reduction benefits of replacing a diesel heavy-duty truck with an electric one, taking a single heavy-duty truck as the object, the variation trend in electric and diesel carbon emission factors from 2023 to 2050 were predicted; coupled with the life spans and life-cycle mileage of the two types of heavy-duty trucks, a dynamic carbon emission model for the heavy-duty trucks was constructed in stages. The carbon footprints of the trucks under the "Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE)", "Announced Pledges Scenario (APS)", and "Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)" were analyzed. In addition, the carbon reduction and carbon reduction rate were calculated. The results showed that battery manufacturing and battery recycling were the main factors to impair the improvement of carbon reduction in the production and recycling stages of electric heavy-duty trucks, respectively. For every 1 g&#183;(kW&#183;h)-1 reduction in the electricity carbon emission factor (CO2), an electric heavy-duty truck could reduce 1.74 t of carbon emissions over its life cycle. Under the three scenarios, the carbon emissions during the operation stage of both types of heavy trucks accounted for more than 90% of the total life-cycle carbon emissions. Carbon reduction benefits from the highest to the lowest were NZE, APS, and STEPS, and their corresponding life-cycle carbon emission reductions were 1054.68, 1021.78, and 1007.97 t, with carbon reduction rates of 54.38%, 52.68%, and 51.97%, respectively.</description>

                Trauma continues to be noted in studies as a risk factor for autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Successful therapeutic interventions that support the reduction of numbing episodes associated with MS may include diet, stress reduction techniques, and biofield therapy.This case report highlights the successful reduction of numbing episodes, stress, and fatigue in an individual 38-year-old Caucasian female patient using nutrition and body-mind-spirit practices. This individual continued conventional interventions while starting medical nutrition therapy. Over the course of 120 days, her treatment was augmented with a Paleolithic-style diet, which eliminated dairy and ultra-processed foods. Other dietary recommendations suggested were the increase of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), decrease of saturated fatty acids (SFAs), and increase in protein and CO2-promoting foods. Integrative recommendations were biofield therapy and for stress reduction were psychotherapy, reduced exercise intensity, lifestyle recovery from trauma, body-mind-spirit practices, and herbal supplementation.Integrative therapies such as diet, stress reduction techniques, and biofield therapy may be used as therapeutic protocols for trauma-induced MS patients. Population-based clinical studies should be done to understand the role of these therapies in synchronization.</description>

      <title>Scalable confined-space microwave heating strategy enables the rapid preparation of N/O co-doped activated carbons with high gas capture capacity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2024.119152</link>

                Heteroatom doping is essential for enhancing the performance of activated carbons (ACs) in various environmental-related applications. Herein, a scalable confined-space microwave heating (CSMH) strategy is proposed and demonstrated to achieve minute-level fast preparation of N/O co-doping ACs with well-developed porosity. The introduction of confined space prevents the escape of nitrogenous and oxygenous volatiles, enabling the sufficient reaction for heteroatom doping. Therefore, the nitrogen content of MWC-0.5 (6.0 at.%) is higher than that of MW-0.5 (3.5 at.%) and CH-0.5 (4.3 at.%). This causes a nearly 50% reduction in the consumption of nitrogenous reagents. Moreover, through CSMH strategy, N/O co-doped ACs (6.0 at% and 8.1 at% for N and O, respectively) with high pore volume (0.53 cm3&#183;g-1) can be acquired to achieve an excellent adsorption performance for toluene (0.31 g&#183;g-1) and CO2 (3.97 mmol&#183;g-1 at 25 &#176;C and 1 bar) and outstanding CO2/N2 selectivity (189 at 0.02 bar). This work for the first time develops a scalable confined-space N/O co-doped strategy for enhancing the chemical activity of ACs with low-spend nitrogenous reagents.</description>

                In terms of energy generation and consumption, ships are autonomous isolated systems, with power demands varying according to the type of ship: passenger or commercial. The power supply in modern ships is based on thermal engines-generators, which use fossil fuels, marine diesel oil (MDO) and liquefied natural gas (LNG). The continuous operation of thermal engines on ships during cruises results in increased emissions of polluting gases, mainly CO/CO2. The combination of renewable energy sources (REs) and triple-fuel diesel engines (TFDEs) can reduce CO/CO2 emissions, resulting in a &#8220;greener&#8221; interaction between ships and the ecosystem. This work presents a new control method for balancing the power generation and the load demands of a ship equipped with TFDEs, fuel cells (FCs), and REs, based on a real and accurate model of a super-tanker and simulation of its operation in real cruise conditions. The new TFDE technology engines are capable of using different fuels (marine diesel oil, heavy fuel oil and liquified natural gas), producing the power required for ship operation, as well as using compositions of other fuels based on diesel, aiming to reduce the polluting gases produced. The energy management system (EMS) of a ship is designed and implemented in the structure of a finite state machine (FSM), using the logical design of transitions from state to state. The results demonstrate that further reductions in fossil fuel consumption as well as CO2 emissions are possible if ship power generation is combined with FC units that consume hydrogen as fuel. The hydrogen is produced locally on the ship through electrolysis using the electric power generated by the on-board renewable energy sources (REs) using photovoltaic systems (PVs) and wind energy conversion turbines (WECs).</description>

                Photoelectrochemical water splitting and CO2 reduction provide an attractive route to produce solar fuels while reducing the level of CO2 emissions. Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have been extensively studied for this purpose in recent years due to their suitable optoelectronic properties. In this review, we survey the recent achievements in the field. After a brief introduction to photoelectrochemical (PEC) processes, we discussed the properties, synthesis, and application of MHPs in this context. We also survey the state-of-the-art findings regarding significant achievements in performance, and developments in addressing the major challenges of toxicity and instability toward water. Efforts have been made to replace the toxic Pb with less toxic materials like Sn, Ge, Sb, and Bi. The stability toward water has been also improved by using various methods such as compositional engineering, 2D/3D perovskite structures, surface passivation, the use of protective layers, and encapsulation. In the last part, considering the experience gained in photovoltaic applications, we provided our perspective for the future challenges and opportunities. We place special emphasis on the improvement of stability as the major challenge and the potential contribution of machine learning to identify the most suitable formulation for halide perovskites with desired properties.</description>

                To achieve the goals of carbon peak and carbon neutrality, Xinjiang, as an autonomous region in China with large energy reserves, should adjust its energy development and vigorously develop new energy sources, such as photovoltaic (PV) power. This study utilized data spatiotemporal variation in solar radiation from 1984 to 2016 to verify that Xinjiang is suitable for the development of PV power generation. Then, the averages of the solar radiation, sunshine duration, and other data in the period after 2000 were used to assess the suitability of Xinjiang, based on spatial principal component analysis (SPCA). Finally, the theoretical power generation potential, fossil fuel reduction, and CO2 emissions reduction were estimated. The results are as follows: (1) In terms of temporal variation, the solar radiation in Xinjiang decreased (1984&#8211;2002), increased (2002&#8211;2009), and decreased again (2009&#8211;2016), but the fluctuations were not statistically significant. In terms of spatial distribution, the Kunlun Mountains in southern Xinjiang had the highest solar radiation during the span of the study period. Hami and Turpan, in eastern Xinjiang, had sufficiently high and stable solar radiation. (2) The area in Xinjiang classed as highly suitable for solar PV power generation is about 87,837 km2, which is mainly concentrated in eastern Xinjiang. (3) In the situation where the construction of PV power plants in Xinjiang is fully developed, the theoretical potential of annual solar PV power generation in Xinjiang is approximately 8.57 &#215; 106 GWh. This is equivalent to 2.59 &#215; 109 tce of coal. Furthermore, 6.58 &#215; 109 t of CO2 emissions can be reduced. PV power generation potential is approximately 27 times the energy consumption of Xinjiang in 2020. Through the suitability assessment and calculations, we found that Xinjiang has significant potential for PV systems.</description>

      <title>Is South Korea's 2050 Carbon-Neutral scenario sufficient for meeting greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2024.101447</link>
      <description>Suhyun Cho, Young-Sun Jeong, Jung-Ho Huh, Energy Sustainable Development/Energy for sustainable development. 80(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394903461

                In line with Global Climate Change Alliance initiated in 2007 by the European Commission, the South Korean government announced the "2050 Carbon-Neutral Strategy" in October 2020. The 2050 Carbon-Neutral Scenario was announced in October 2021, with the aim of reducing the country's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 40 % by 2030 compared to those in 2018. The primary objective of this study is to conduct a scenario-based comparative analysis focusing on the forecast of greenhouse gas emissions and the potential for reduction within the building sector. The methodology employed in this study utilizes the greenhouse gas emission calculation methods outlined in the IPCC Guidelines of 1996 and 2006. Based on the national building energy and statistics database for the years 2015 to 2019, the study analyzes building types, building energy intensity, and floor areas to calculate emissions and energy consumption within the sector. The results indicate that the emissions will increase continuously from 2020 (156.9 million tons of CO2 equivalent) to 2050 (217.8 million tons of CO2 equivalent). We have considered the four scenarios outlined in the '2050 Carbon Neutrality Scenario' as the most effective strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the building sector. These include: (1) Mandatory implementation of Zero-Energy Buildings (ZEB) for new buildings by 2050, (2) 100 % execution of green remodeling for existing buildings, (3) Promotion of high-efficiency devices to achieve a 25&#8211;30 % improvement in energy consumption efficiency compared to 2018 and an enhancement of device energy use per unit, and (4) Expansion of clean heat utilization such as fuel cells and waste heat utilization in district heating. Thus, the possibility of South Korea achieving the 2050 carbon-neutrality target in the building sector is low. Therefore, it is important to develop effective emissions reduction policies and plans for the building sector.</description>

      <title>Improving the Efficiency of the Trombe Wall by Integrating Multi-fold Glazing and Sustainable Materials: Ifrane, Morocco as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2024.109310</link>
      <description>Hasna Oukmi, Badr Chegari, Ouadia Mouhat, Mohamed Rougui, Mohammed El Ganaoui, Mohammed Cherkaoui, Journal of building engineering. 89(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394849030

                The Trombe wall is renowned for its effectiveness in passive heating during winter, but it can lead to overheating in summer. To address this issue, this study investigates a Trombe wall with fully opening glazing during the summer season, employing multi-fold glazing. The research, conducted in Ifrane, Morocco, focuses on a residential building using the Conduction Finite Difference Method within the DesignBuilder software, and examines three configurations: a reference configuration, classic Trombe wall, and Trombe wall with multi-fold glazing. The results demonstrate that the last configuration achieves a 63% (24,94 kWh/m2) reduction in total energy consumption compared to the reference configuration and a 34% (7,62 kWh/m2) reduction compared to the classic Trombe wall. Additionally, the implementation of sustainable ecological biomaterials, such as timber instead of concrete, is explored to reduce CO2 emissions. Further analysis of the Trombe wall with multi-fold glazing is conducted by considering five parameters: glazing type, emissivity, vent size, insulation, and PCM thicknesses. These parameters are examined across five different variables. Reducing emissivity leads to reductions of 51% and 30% in heating energy consumption and discomfort hours, respectively. Modifying the type of glazing results in an 11% reduction in heating energy consumption. Increasing insulation thickness leads to notable reductions of 15% in heating energy consumption and 6% in discomfort hours. Conversely, increasing PCM thickness and vent size yields had minimal impact on total energy consumption, each resulting in a 1% reduction. This research provides insights into optimizing Trombe walls by integrating multi-fold glazing to address summer overheating issues and by exploring additional parameters to enhance system performance.</description>

      <title>Pattern diversity based trip-level impact evaluation on mileage and emissions of on-demand ride-splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2024.104616</link>
      <description>Danyue Zhi, Ying Liu, Huijun Sun, Zaihan Gao, Xiaoyan Feng, Ziyou Gao, Transportation research. Part C, Emerging technologies. 162(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394946608

                Ride-splitting offers significant potential for reducing travel mileage and emissions. However, the patterns of ride-splitting demonstrate both diversity and complexity, yet there remains a deficiency in systematic and in-depth investigations of these patterns. This study aims to explore multiple patterns of ride-splitting and to evaluate the associated impacts on mileage and emission savings based on the pattern diversity. Firstly, two methods that are respectively for calculating the sub-pattern types from every ride-splitting pattern in theory, and for recognizing the actual sub-patterns in reality, are sequentially proposed. Then, the adjusted passenger mileage considering ride-splitting (i.e., APM) is proposed with detailed calculation methods for various ride-splitting patterns. Furthermore, a trip-level method for estimating emission reduction is developed by integrating the comparison of APM with the shortest mileage into the MOVES model. Finally, mileage saving and emissions reduction of ride-splitting in trip-level are investigated using the data sets of Beijing and Xiamen, respectively. The pattern diversity results show that 20 ride-splitting sub-patterns in actual data can be explored in Beijing and Xiamen. The average mileage savings can be obtained at the trip-level, which is 1.32 km for Beijing and 1.36 km for Xiamen. In the 20 sub-patterns, it is indicated that more trips involved in ride-splitting may not result in a more effective reduction, and the three-group-passenger pattern shows the best performance in CO2 reduction. The study can provide promising results for understanding the strength of ride-splitting in reducing emissions and supporting the promotion of low-carbon travel modes.</description>

                La, Mn and Co-based materials with diverse compositions encapsulated in N-doped carbon materials were synthesized by an in-situ sol-gel method. The as-prepared materials were physically activated with CO2 giving as a result composites with excellent performance for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The composites were characterized by different physicochemical techniques revealing the importance of porosity created by CO2 activation. This crucial step increases the number of accessible active sites such as Co-Nx-C sites, Co/MnO heterointerfaces and graphitic N groups. Moreover, the formation of La2O2CO3 was detected to enhance electrical conductivity and electrochemical performance and it is active for ORR. Although the composite containing La, Mn and Co has less concentration of the highly active sites, its small particle size favour a better distribution of these sites. The Co-containing composites were tested as air-electrodes in a Zn-air battery and compared to commercial electrocatalysts. All composites showed a better operation in terms of higher cyclability and higher energy density which is a consequence of metal nanostructures encapsulation in N-doped porous carbon shells. Interestingly, the pure Co-based composite showed an outstanding performance related to the high concentration of the Co-Nx-C active sites that provide high activity and stability.</description>

                Abstract Platooning represents a crucial strategy for mitigating emissions from heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs). This study evaluates the effects of platoon composition on the surrounding airflow utilizing a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, and quantifies the resultant fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions. This study examines fuel consumption data reconstructed from field experiments to validate the CFD model&#8217;s ability to accurately simulate drag forces within a homogeneous three-truck platoon. The potential for fuel savings was assessed based on CFD-simulated fuel consumption, taking into account various inter-vehicle distances and driving speeds. The model successfully reproduced the fuel consumption observed in a platooning formation comprising lead, middle, and trailing trucks, with an error margin below 6.2%. While the lead and middle trucks exhibited increased fuel consumption with greater inter-vehicle distances, the trailing truck showed decreased fuel consumption with specific distance-to-length ratios (D/L), followed by an increase from a D/L of 1.1. Additionally, a significant decrease in total fuel efficiency was noted for D/L ratios exceeding 1.5. Considering the diverse platooning scenarios analyzed, the study anticipates an annual reduction of up to 7 tons of CO2 equivalent per vehicle. By optimizing platooning configurations, this research contributes to enhancing fuel efficiency and reducing emissions from HDVs.</description>

Fractional CO2 laser therapy may serve as a novel minimally invasive treatment for PD. The objective of the study is to evaluate changes in penile curvature and the safety of fractional CO2 laser therapy in subjects with chronic phase PD. METHODS: This was a single site non-randomized and open label study utilizing a fractional CO2 laser. Subjects underwent 3 treatment sessions every 6 weeks with a fractional CO2 device using low density settings. Topical triamcinolone was applied immediately after each treatment and a petroleum product was applied to the treated area 2-5x/day for a week. Between treatments, patients were required to perform at-home penile modeling three times daily. Penile curvature assessments were performed and self-reported questionnaires were collected at baseline, 24-weeks, and 52-week follow-up. Adverse events were assessed at each treatment and by self-reported diaries. RESULTS: There was a total of 5 patients included in the study. All study participants completed all of the follow up assessments. The median baseline penile curvature was 37&#176; (range: 30&#176; - 50&#176;) and at the 52-weeks, this had reduced to a median curvature to 28&#176; (range: 14&#176; - 44&#176;) (p=0.03). This represented a median reduction in penile curvature by 24.3% (range: 16.9% - 53.3%) and a mean change of -11.6&#176;&#177;3.58&#176; in curvature for each patient. Overall, the IIEF Overall scores were comparable at baseline and at 52 week follow-up (median: 59, range: 33 - 71 vs. median: 60, range: 52 &#8211; 72 respectively, p=0.81). However, patients did report significant improvement in overall PDQ scores at baseline as compared to 52- weeks after laser treatment (median: 26, range: 15 - 30, vs. median: 14, range: 6 &#8211; 23 respectively, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Fractional CO2 laser therapy may serve as a safe and minimally invasive therapy for PD, with results at both 24 and 52 weeks being encouraging. Further clinical trials are warranted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fractional CO2 laser therapy in the treatment of PD.

                Silver is a prominent material for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) to CO with high Faradaic efficiency (FE), relatively low price, and huge reserves. Size and structure control of metallic nanomaterials have been confirmed to significantly affect the catalytic performance. For this purpose, a microfluidic synthesis platform is built innovatively to achieve controllable, precise, and continuous preparation of monodisperse silver nanocubes (Ag NCs). Three stages of the growth process for Ag NCs are revealed through online regulation of residence time, and then the formation mechanism is proposed. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the catalytic role of Ag2S clusters and the synergistic capping effect of Cl&#8722; and PVP. Finally, the prepared Ag NCs are applied to CO2RR, achieving 95.6 % CO FE at &#8722;0.8 VRHE and stable operation for at least 12 h.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2024.118372</link>
      <description>El Mouatez Billah Messini, Yacine Bourek, Chouaib Ammari, Apostolos Pesyridis, Energy conversion and management. 308(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394802642

                The global demand for sustainable energy solutions in the oil and gas industry has stimulated interest in the integration of renewable energy sources. This paper investigates the techno-economic and environmental aspects of incorporating a solar-hydrogen-based hybrid renewable energy system (SHRES) into oil and gas processing facilities. The proposed SHRES, comprising Solar PV modules, hydrogen production and storage systems, and a gas turbine generator (PV-FC-EL-Tank-GT), aims to enhance energy efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of energy-intensive operations. The study utilises a multidisciplinary approach, encompassing engineering, economics, and environmental analysis. The techno-economic evaluation employs detailed modelling and optimisation using Fick's Law Algorithm, ensuring efficient energy production and cost-effectiveness. Ecological assessments quantify potential reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts. The technical and economic evaluation identifies the electrolyser system as the most significant cost contributor (57%). The optimised system balances energy sources with 45% from PV modules, 35% from fuel cells, and 20% from gas turbines, showcasing substantial reliance on renewable energy while maintaining required power generation. Addressing the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions in the oil and gas industry, the study highlights the potential of SHRES integration. By employing Fick's Law Algorithm, alongside with 80 % of renewable energy integration, the research optimises system components to optimise the annualised cost to be $57,539.85, decrease to zero the Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP), and mitigate CO2 emissions to a lowest value of 0.147 gCO2eq/kWh (by 80 %). The electrolyser system's pivotal role and the distribution of power generation sources are emphasised. This study presents a novel approach to integrating solar-hydrogen systems into oil and gas processing facilities, aiming for sustainability. The findings underscore the significance of the electrolyser system and the distribution of power generation sources in optimising the SHRES. Recommendations for renewable energy integration and potential reductions in CO2 emissions and costs are discussed, providing valuable insights for future energy policies.</description>

      <title>Modification of the Zn&#8211;Co double metal cyanide complex for the synthesis of carbon dioxide&#8211;derived poly(ether&#8211;carbonate) polyols</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcou.2024.102768</link>
      <description>Aiqin Wang, Yunfei Yuan, Xiaoyun Li, Qian Chen, Maoqing Kang, Qifeng Li, Junwei Wang, Journal of CO2 utilization. 82(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394936112

                The Zn&#8211;Co double metal cyanide (DMC) complex is regarded as a promising catalyst for the copolymerization of CO2 and propylene epoxide (PO). Various methods have been adopted to improve the catalytic performance of DMC. In this study, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), as a co-complexing agent, was innovatively used to modify DMC and applied to the synthesis of poly(ether&#8211;carbonate) polyols from CO2, PO, and a chain transfer agent. The modified catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activity than the catalysts prepared by conventional methods, with a nearly 10 % increase in PO conversion. The most critical breakthrough was a reduction of nearly 5 wt% in the byproduct propylene&#8211;carbonate. The results confirmed that amide groups in PVP could coordinate with active center Zn2+, providing the modified catalysts with advantages such as low-symmetry structure, high specific surface area, and strong acidity. Moreover, the dual effects of PVP coordination and dispersion led to dramatic differences in the microstructure and activity of the catalysts when added during different preparation processes of DMC. The coordination effect of PVP was dominant in the nucleation stages which affected the crystal structure and morphology, whereas, the dispersion effect was dominant in the aging stages which prevented the catalyst particles from growing and thus a higher specific surface area. This is critical for paving the way towards exploring the introduction of groups with high steric hindrance into Zn&#8211;Co complex catalysts. In addition, a detailed and in-depth insight into the structure&#8211;activity relationship of DMC for poly(ether&#8211;carbonate) polyols synthesis was summarized.</description>

                Copper-based bimetallic heterojunction catalysts facilitate the deep electrochemical reduction of CO2 (eCO2RR) to produce high-value-added organic compounds, which hold significant promise. Understanding the influence of copper interactions with other metals on the adsorption strength of various intermediates is crucial as it directly impacts the reaction selectivity. In this review, an overview of the formation mechanism of various catalytic products in eCO2RR is provided and highlight the uniqueness of copper-based catalysts. By considering the different metals' adsorption tendencies toward various reaction intermediates, metals are classified, including copper, into four categories. The significance and advantages of constructing bimetallic heterojunction catalysts are then discussed and delve into the research findings and current development status of different types of copper-based bimetallic heterojunction catalysts. Finally, insights are offered into the design strategies for future high-performance electrocatalysts, aiming to contribute to the development of eCO2RR to multi-carbon fuels with high selectivity.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive and Quantitative Separation of Different NO Routes during Moderate and Intense Low-Oxygen Dilution Oxy-fuel Combustion of Pulverized Coal Particles</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.4c00226</link>

                Moderate and intense low-oxygen dilution oxy-coal combustion (MILD-OCC) technology is prospective as a result of its high thermal efficiency, low NOx emission, and applications for carbon capture and sequestration. MILD-OCC experiments were carried out on the flat flame burner combustion facility where the diffusion flamelet can provide the stable hot coflow of the fixed temperatures and oxygen volume fractions. The flue gas species concentrations at different axial heights above the burner tip were measured by the flue gas analyzer. First, pulverized coal particle combustion experiments under CO2, N2 and Ar dilution with different coflow temperatures and oxygen volume fractions were carried out to quantitatively separate thermal and fuel NO. The NO formation kinetics were obtained through nth-order Arrhenius nonlinear fitting to calculate the relative contributions of thermal and fuel NO. Second, the comparison between the experiments of coal and char combustion was made to quantitatively separate the formation and reduction of volatile NO and char NO. Finally, different concentrations of initial NO were added to the oxidizer to simulate recycled NO, and the experiments on the influence of different concentrations of recycled NO were conducted to quantitatively separate the recycled NO reburning. Therefore, the NO formation and reduction mechanisms during the whole process of MILD-OCC were quantitatively separated, and their relative contributions were identified. With the increase of the coflow temperature from 1473 to 1873 K under the condition of 10% O2, the relative contribution rate of volatile NO reduction to fuel NO decreases from 25 to 17%, with the relative contribution rate of char NO reduction to fuel NO increasing from 2 to 9% and the relative contribution rate of recycled NO reburning to fuel NO increasing from 7 to 19%. The results can provide a comprehensive and quantitative perspective on the NOx routes and the control method of low NOx emissions for MILD-OCC.</description>

                In case of cement industry, large amounts of waste by-products are effectively utilized as alternative sources for fuel and raw materials. The objective of this study is to assess environmental effects on cement manufacturing process in utilization of wastes compared to the alternative waste treatment systems, such as landfill and/or incineration, etc. Both LCI and LCIA were conducted with a perspective of gate to grave as well as scenario analysis in order to figure out more detailed environmentally key issuses. The seven major manufacturing companies were chosen for portland cement - Type I and conducted LCI. Generally, site-specific data was applied. If it's not impossible, database was used. Impact assessment was carried out consecutively as classification, characterization, normalization and weighting by Eco-indicator. The eco-indicators of cement system, scenario A(bituminous coal), B(raw material), C(landfill/incineration/recycling) were 53.4288, 2.0307, 0.00077, respectively. The key issues of cement system is a GWP by CO2 released kiln. The scenario analysis is performed in order to compare the reduction of environmental impact when recycled resources make used of kiln and treatment system. The environmental burden of kiln system is lower than landfill and/or incineration system.</description>

      <title>Energy-optimal car-following model for connected automated vehicles considering traffic flow stability</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2024.131333</link>
      <description>Yanyan Qin, Mingxuan Liu, Wei Hao, Energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394934978

                To reduce energy consumption and transportation emissions during car-following behavior on highways, we propose a car-following model for connected automated vehicles (CAVs). This new model considers spacing variation of the surrounding vehicles located immediately upstream and downstream. We optimize the key parameter of forward control weight of the proposed CAV model to stabilize traffic flow and ensure stable conditions. Then simulation experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed CAV model in enhancing traffic flow stability and energy-saving in mixed traffic consisting of both CAVs and regular vehicles (RVs). Results show that traffic flow controlled by the proposed CAV model is less affected by disturbances. The increase of CAV penetration rates can gradually improve stability of the mixed traffic flow. CAVs equipped with our proposed model can effectively reduce energy consumption and transportation emissions, which decrease with an increase of CAV penetration rates under constant speed conditions. When CAV penetration rate reaches 100%, the average reduction of energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and NOx emissions at various speeds reach a peak value of 22.15%, 31.00%, and 56.41%, respectively. Speed also has significant influence on energy consumption and emissions, with potential reductions when speed falls within an appropriate range.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Evolving Waste Management Strategies in Addis Ababa City, Ethiopia: A Life Cycle Assessment Approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-3897-1_12</link>
      <description>Gemechu Beyene Mekonnen, Let&#237;cia Sarmento dos Muchangos, Lisa Ito, Akihiro Tokai, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394861886

                This study aims to evaluate the evolving municipal solid waste management (MSWM) strategies in Addis Ababa City, capital of Ethiopia, based on greenhouse gas (GHG) and short-lived climate pollutants (i.e., black carbon) emissions. Comparable to the existing practice of open disposal and burning, with only 5% recycling, four alternative scenarios were developed considering advances proposed on the City's Structural Plan of 2017&#8211;2027. The first scenario (S-1) suggests mixed-waste collection and disposal in a sanitary landfill while keeping the current recycling. The second (S-2) promotes the source-separated collection, organic waste composting, recycling in material recycling facilities, and disposal in a sanitary landfill. The third (S-3) adds incineration with energy recovery on S-2 to divert a portion of waste from landfills. The fourth (S-4) replaces composting in S-2 by anaerobic digestion with biogas energy production. The existing practice is estimated to emit 703,291 t CO2-eq GHG and 75.10 t black carbon (BC) from yearly waste. S-1 showed 55% increase in GHG emission and 92% reduction in BC; S-2 showed 1% increase in GHG and 93% reduction in BC; S-3 showed 83% reduction in GHG and 125% increase in BC; and S-4 showed 11% reduction in GHG and negative net emissions of BC. The results indicated that no proposed scenario is climate-friendly. However, S-3 performs better in GHG reduction, specifically for methane (CH4). S-4, in turn, is safe in terms of BC. Although the sensitivity analysis revealed GHG emission from S-3 increases with future waste composition changes, it will remain the first choice for the climate. The study identified CH4 and BC as critical parameters in tracking improvements. Hence, proper planning that involves increasing organic waste transformation, CH4 recovery from landfills, and strict flue gas management during waste incineration can optimize the results.</description>

      <title>Boosting oxygen reduction durability by embedding Co9S8 nanoparticles into Co single atoms anchored porous carbon frameworks</title>

                Developing an efficient and low-cost oxygen reduction electrocatalyst is essential for the application of aqueous zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, we report a facile adsorption-confined pyrolysis strategy to fabricate the hybrid electrocatalyst (denoted as Co9S8/CoSA-PC) by embedding Co9S8 nanoparticles into Co single atoms (Co-SAs) anchored porous carbon sheets for boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) durability. In this strategy, the Co2+ ions are first absorbed into oxygen-rich porous carbon nanosheets and further form the Co-SAs with the help of thiourea in the following pyrolysis procedure, which is believed to be able to confine the generated Co9S8 nanoparticles into carbon frameworks due to their interface interaction. Benefiting from the synergistic effect of different components, the obtained Co9S8/CoSA-PC electrocatalyst for ORR exhibits outstanding catalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.82 V and a distinguished long-term durability with a current retention of 80 % after cycling 80 h under alkaline conditions, which is superior to commercial Pt/C. Moreover, the assembled ZABs with Co9S8/CoSA-PC as cathodic catalyst deliver a high specific capacity of 764 mAh gZn-1 at 10 mA cm-2 and the outstanding peak power density of up to 221.4 mW cm-2. This work provides a novel structure design strategy to prepare transition metal sulfide-based electrocatalysts with superior durability for ORR.</description>

                Despite the widespread utilization of variable valence metals in electrochemistry, it is still a formidable challenge to enhance the valence conversion efficiency to achieve excellent catalytic activity without introducing heterophase elements. Herein, the in-situ precipitation of Co particles on Co2VO4 not only enhanced the concentration of oxygen vacancies (Ov) but also generated a greater number of low-valence metals, thereby enabling efficient reduction towards Hg(II). The electroanalysis results demonstrate that the sensitivity of Co/Co2VO4 towards Hg(II) was measured at an impressive value of 1987.74 &#956;A &#956;M-1 cm-2, significantly surpassing previously reported results. Further research reveals that Ov acted as the main adsorption site to capture Hg(II). The redox reactions of Co2+/Co3+ and V3+/V4+ played a synergistic role in the reduction of Hg(II), accompanied by the continuous supply of electrons from zero-valent Co to expedite the valence cycle. The Co/Co2VO4/GCE presented remarkable selectivity towards Hg(II), with excellent stability, reproducibility, and anti-interference capability. The electrode also exhibited minimal sensitivity fluctuations towards Hg(II) in real water samples, underscoring its practicality for environmental applications. This study elucidates the mechanism underlying the surface redox reaction of metal oxides facilitated by zero-valent metals, providing us with new strategies for further design of efficient and practical sensors.</description>

      <title>A clean disposal method of carbide slag with carbon emission reduction: Used as a flux for iron ore sintering</title>

                Limestone or quicklime is a necessary flux in the iron ore sintering process. Its production and application process will cause CO2 emissions and various environmental pollution, but this has not attracted enough attention. Carbide slag (CS) is a calcium-rich solid waste produced in acetylene production, the harmless disposal of which is still incomplete, resulting in soil and groundwater pollution. This study investigated the granulation characteristics and sintering performance of the sintering mixture with different proportions of CS. The results show that replacing limestone with an appropriate proportion of CS is promising and beneficial to the formation of high-quality bonding phase. When CS accounts for 75% of the total mass of CS and limestone, the tumbler index increases by 8.10% and the comprehensive index decreases only from 100 to 96.16, which is within the acceptable range. The application of CS in iron ore sintering can achieve a clean disposal of it and a considerable carbon emission reduction, as the main component of which is Ca(OH)2.</description>

      <title>Determination of the hydration and carbonation kinetics of CaO for low-temperature applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2024.120146</link>

                In this work, the reaction kinetics of CaO were investigated with interest in its application as a sorbent in the sorption-enhanced methanation process. Therefore, hydration and carbonation kinetics were studied under operating conditions analogous to those required by the process (i.e. atmospheric pressure and temperature range between 200 &#176;C and 350 &#176;C). Two different CaO-based materials were considered in this study. The experimental results indicated that a shrinking core model with chemical reaction control successfully predicted hydration and carbonation conversion for both CaO-based sorbents. The activation energy obtained was similar for both sorbents, being 1.69 kJ/mol and 1.76 kJ/mol for the hydration reaction and 22.27 kJ/mol and 21.60 kJ/mol for the carbonation reaction. Additionally, the present study investigated the impact of simultaneous hydration and carbonation reactions. Both sorbents showed a reduction in hydration capacity when CO2 was introduced into the reaction atmosphere due to the formation of a CaCO3 product layer.</description>

                To predict and evaluate the carbon footprint in the gas phase, furnace fuel oil oxidation in excess air (alpha factor 1.3) was studied over a wide temperature (T = 298&#8211;3000 K, P = 0.1 MPa). Equilibrium thermodynamic parameters (entropy, enthalpy, and internal energy) and the concentration distributions of C-, S-, N-, O-, and H-containing components and active particles in the gas phase were determined. Based on the total concentration distribution of C-, S-, N-, O-, and H-containing components and active particles in the gas phase, the weight content of carbon was calculated. Taking into account the chemical matrix of the furnace fuel oil&#8211;air system and the weight content of carbon, the man-made load of carbon in the gas phase was found. The results of the work made it possible to evaluate the carbon footprint in the gas phase because of the combustion of fuel, in particular, furnace fuel oil in air. Reduction of the man-made load of carbon oxides (CO, CO2) in the gas phase was achieved by modifying and burning furnace fuel oil in the form of oil-in-water (reverse) emulsions in E-1/9M industrial boilers.</description>

      <title>Regeneration of copper catalysts mediated by molybdenum-based oxides</title>

                Cu catalysts, known for their unparalleled catalytic capabilities due to their unique electronic structure, have faced inherent challenges in maintaining long-term effectiveness under harsh hydrogenation conditions. Here, we demonstrate a molybdenum-mediated redispersion behavior of Cu under high-temperature oxidation conditions. The oxidized Cu nanoparticles with rich metal-support interfaces tend to dissolve into the MoO3 support upon heating to 600 &#176;C, which facilitates the subsequent regeneration in a reducing atmosphere. A similar redispersion phenomenon is observed for Cu nanoparticles supported on ZnO-modified MoO3. The modification of ZnO significantly improves the performance of the Cu catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol, with the high activity being well maintained after four repeated oxidation-reduction cycles. In situ spectroscopic and theoretical analyses suggest that the interaction involved in the formation of the copper molybdate-like compound is the driving force for the redispersion of Cu. This method is applicable to various Mo-based oxide supports, offering a practical strategy for the regeneration of sintered Cu particles in hydrogenation applications.</description>

      <title>Development of an ettringite-based low carbon binder by promoting the nucleation and Ostwald ripening process</title>

                A low-carbon binder with ettringite as the main binding phase is prepared at ambient temperature using waste gypsum and metallurgical slag as raw materials. The technical limits of slow setting and low early strength are caused by the insufficient ettringite formation. This is tackled by fine tuning the thermodynamic route of ettringite formation process using polyaluminium compound via promoting the nucleation and Ostwald ripening process of ettringite formation. The high positive charge polymeric Al species and numerous Al(OH)4- generated by the hydrolysis of polyaluminium compounds increase the oversaturation degree and enhance the driving force of the Ostwald ripening process of ettringite. The volume ratio of ettringite/C-(A)-S-H in hydration products is further increased remarkably, resulting in the reduction of setting time and the enhancement of compressive strength. The carbon emission of the non-calcined ettringite-based binders developed in this study is 71&#8211;87 kg CO2-e/t. The research provides theoretical support for the development and application of a novel ettringite-based low carbon binders.</description>

                The integration of high-rate activated sludge (HRAS), an effective carbon redirection technology, with partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A) is a novel AB treatment process for municipal wastewater. In this study, an airlift HRAS reactor was operated in the continuous inflow mode for 200 d at a wastewater treatment plant. The balance between potential PN/A system stability and peak HRAS performance under decreasing hydraulic retention time (HRT) was optimized. Energy consumption and recovery and CO2 emissions were calculated. The results showed that the optimal HRT suitable with the PN/A process was 3 h, achieving 2&#8211;3 g/L mixed liquor volatile suspended solid, 67.8 % chemical oxygen demand (COD) recovery, 81 % total COD removal efficiency, 2.27 &#177; 1.03 g COD/L/d organic loading rate, 62 % aeration reduction, and 0.24 kWh/m3 power recovery potential. Such findings hold practical value and contribute to the development of the optimal AB process capable of achieving energy autonomy and carbon neutrality.</description>

      <title>Controlling Interfacial Hydrogen Bonding at a Gold Surface: The Effect of Organic Cosolvents</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.4c00645</link>

                Water often serves as both a reactant and solvent in electrocatalytic reactions. Interfacial water networks can affect the transport and kinetics of these reactions, e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction and CO2 reduction reaction. Adding cosolvents that influence the hydrogen-bonding (H-bonding) environment, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), has the potential to tune the reactivity of these important electrocatalytic reactions by regulating the interfacial local environment and water network. We investigate interfacial H-bonding networks in water-DMSO cosolvent mixtures on gold surfaces by using surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. Experiments and simulations show that the gold surface is enriched with dehydrated DMSO molecules and the mixture phase-separates to form water clusters. Simulations show a "buckled" water conformation at the surface, further constraining interfacial H-bonding. The small size of these water clusters and the energetically unfavorable H-bond conformations might inhibit H-bonding with bulk water, suppressing the proton diffusion required for efficient hydrogen evolution reaction processes.</description>

      <title>Designing Retirement Strategies for Coal-Fired Power Plants to Mitigate Air Pollution and Health Impacts</title>

                Retiring coal power plants can reduce air pollution and health damages. However, the spatial distribution of those impacts remains unclear due to complex power system adjustments and pollution chemistry and transport. Focusing on coal retirements in Pennsylvania (PA), we analyze six counterfactual scenarios for 2019 that differ in retirement targets (e.g., reducing 50% of coal-based installed capacity vs. generation) and priorities (e.g., closing plants with higher cost, closer to Environmental Justice Areas, or with higher CO2 emissions). Using a power system model of the PJM Interconnection, we find that coal retirements in PA shift power generation across PA and the Rest of PJM region leading to scenario-varying changes in the plant-level release of several air pollutants. Due to air pollution chemistry and transport and socio-demographics, these changes in turn give rise to a reduction of 10 to 182 PM2.5-attributable deaths in PJM across the six scenarios, with most reductions occurring in PA. Scenarios that reduce more coal power generation yield greater aggregate health benefits due to air quality improvements in PA and adjacent downwind regions. In addition, vulnerable populations&amp;mdash;in both PA and Rest of PJM&amp;mdash;benefit most in scenarios that prioritize plant closures in PA near Environmental Justice Areas. These results demonstrate the importance of considering cross-regional linkages and socio-demographics in designing equitable retirement strategies.</description>

                In the quest for proficient electrocatalysts for ammonia's electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction, cobalt oxides, endowed with a rich d-electron reservoir, have emerged as frontrunners. Despite the previously evidenced prowess of CoO in this realm, its ammonia yield witnesses a pronounced decline as the reaction unfolds, a phenomenon linked to the electron attrition from its Co2+ active sites during electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (ENRR). To counteract this vulnerability, we harnessed electron-laden phosphorus (P) elements as dopants, aiming to recalibrate the electronic equilibrium of the pivotal Co active site, thereby bolstering both its catalytic performance and stability. Our empirical endeavors showcased the doped P-CoO's superior credentials: it delivered an impressive ammonia yield of 49.6 and, notably, a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 9.6% at &#8722;0.2 V versus RHE, markedly eclipsing its undoped counterpart. Probing deeper, a suite of ex-situ techniques, complemented by rigorous theoretical evaluations, was deployed. This dual-pronged analysis unequivocally revealed CoO's propensity for an electron-driven valence metamorphosis to Co3+ post-ENRR. In stark contrast, P-CoO, fortified by P doping, exhibits a discernibly augmented ammonia yield. Crucially, P's intrinsic ability to staunch electron leakage from the active locus during ENRR ensures the preservation of the valence state, culminating in enhanced catalytic dynamism and fortitude. This investigation not only illuminates the intricacies of active site electronic modulation in ENRR but also charts a navigational beacon for further enhancements in this domain.</description>

                Alternative energy storage systems to lithium-ion batteries that can reduce the dependency on such technology have attracted great interest in recent years. Besides their current limitations, multivalent batteries based on coupling a metallic anode (Mg, Zn, Ca&#8230;) with a multivalent intercalation cathode are considered as a potential option. Prussian Blue Analogues (PBAs) have shown promising multivalent intercalation capacities and have also been employed in other scientific fields like wastewater treatment, selective element extraction, and may have a potential applicability in batteries recycling. However, some controversies have recently appeared around the capacity of PBAs to incorporate multivalent cations in aqueous media. In this work, we analyze by a combinatorial approach using structural and electrochemical techniques the potential Ni2+ and Co2+ intercalation in K0.61Ni[Fe(CN)6]0.84&#9633;0.16&#183;2.12H2O, its limitations, the role of proton intercalation and the cation released after oxidation, which differed from the intercalated during previous reduction step. The potential implications of such findings in current uses of PBAs for multivalent batteries are also discussed.</description>

                Ceramometal catalysts CuFeAlO/CuFeAl, obtained from various powdered Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Al precursors differing in stoichiometry and preparation method, were characterized by physicochemical methods and studied in the water gas shift reaction (CO + H2O &#8652; CO2 + H2). The catalysts are a monolith porous composites, in which metal particles are covered with an oxide shell. The sample Cu : Fe : Al = 45 : 22 : 33, synthesized from powder precursor in two stages was shown to be the most stable. At the first stage the mechanochemical melting of Cu and Fe powders was done. The mechanochemical treatment of obtained product and Al powder was performed at the second stage. This procedure provides the most homogeneous distribution of the components in the precursor. Initial and tested at 400&#176;C ceramometal catalysts were characterized with XRD, SEM and XPS methods. It was revealed that the most active at 350&#176;C catalysts after reductive treatment have Cu1+ and Fe3+ sites. The least active catalysts are completely reduced to Cu0 and partially &#8211; to Fe0. It was found that the activity at 330&#8211;400&#176;C is determined not only by iron, but also by copper active centers on the surface of the catalysts, or their combined action. Two-stage mechanical activation, apparently, leads to a deeper chemical interaction of the components &#8211; Fe and Cu, which provides a higher activity of chromium-free CuFeAl ceramic-metal catalysts.</description>

                Energy management in the residential sector contributes to energy system dispatching and security with the optimal use of renewable energy systems (RES) and energy storage systems (ESSs) and by utilizing the main grid based on its state. This work focuses on optimal energy flow, ESS parameters, and energy consumption scheduling based on demand response (DR) programs. The primary goals of the work consist of minimizing electricity costs while simultaneously extending the lifetime of ESSs in conjunction with extracting maximum benefits throughout their operational lifespan and reducing CO2 emissions. Effective ESS and photovoltaic (PV) energy usage prices are modeled and an efficient energy flow management algorithm is presented, which considers the life cycle of the ESSs including batteries, electrical vehicles (EVs) and the efficient use of the PV system while reducing the cost of energy consumption. In addition, an optimization technique is employed to obtain the optimal ESS parameters including the size and depth of discharge (DOD), considering the installation cost, levelized cost of storage (LCOS), winter and summer conditions, energy consumption profile, and energy prices. Finally, an optimization technique is applied to obtain the optimal energy consumption scheduling. The proposed system provides all of the possibilities of exchanging energy between EV, battery, PV system, grid, and home. The optimization problem is solved using the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) in MATLAB with an interval time of one minute. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed system, presenting an actual cost reduction of 28.9% and 17.7% in summer and winter, respectively, compared to a base scenario. Similarly, the energy losses were reduced by 26.7% in winter and 22.3% in summer, and the EV battery lifetime was extended from 9.2 to 19.1 years in the winter scenario and from 10.4 to 17.7 years in the summer scenario. The integrated system provided a financial contribution during the operational lifetime of EUR 11,600 and 7900 in winter and summer scenarios, respectively. The CO2 was reduced by 59.7% and 46.2% in summer and winter scenarios, respectively.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Decarbonization Based on Environmental Footprint Indicators in Power Generation in Japan</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-3897-1_18</link>
      <description>Masayoshi Imanishi, Lisa Ito, Let&#237;cia Sarmento dos Muchangos, Akihiro Tokai, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394849553

                Toward decarbonization, it is expected that hydrogenation and electrification will progress in the industrial sector, which accounts for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions in Japan. Research on measures and scenarios related to decarbonization are underway, and there are few previous studies that quantitatively evaluate the trade-off relationship of the environmental load impact between CO2 emission reduction and earth resource consumption which includes material consumption, land system change, atmospheric aerosol loading, and chemical pollution. In this study, a comprehensive framework for the evaluation of environmental load impact with footprint indicators is presented, considering the technical options for decarbonization from 2030 to 2050 in power generation. In the power generation process, there are some measures for decarbonization, including the utilization of renewable energy power generation. A special focus in this study is set on the future scenarios of energy and material requirements for the construction of renewable energy power plants and evaluating the direct and indirect environmental load required as footprint indicators with the material footprint, ecological footprint, carbon footprint, and chemical footprint, which is a new indicator estimating the environmental loads of chemical substances. The chemical footprint is the indicator defined as the occupation of a theoretical freshwater volume needed to dilute a chemical emission to the point where it causes no damage to the ecosystem. In this study, material and energy consumption, including chemical substances, are estimated according to future scenarios and the effects of chemical substances were mainly evaluated. As a result, there is a trade-off between an increase in ecological footprint and carbon footprint due to newly introduced steel resources and an increase in material footprint and chemical footprint due to copper resources as the composition ratio of offshore wind power generation increases. While promoting the decarbonization of power generation fuel for the purpose of directly reducing CO2 emission, the introduction of base metal materials accompanying the construction of new renewable energy power generation facilities will increase the indirect environmental load. In the evaluation of technical options for the decarbonization of the power generation process for the future, a comprehensive and quantitative evaluation framework, including the evaluation of the environmental load associated with the use of chemical substances, is presented.</description>

      <title>Cyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene-Stabilized Gold Nanoparticles for Selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction</title>

                N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) have recently gained significant attention as capping ligands for gold nanoparticles due to their strong &#963;-donation properties. It has already been established that the strong &#963;-donation of NHCs enriches the surface of the gold nanoparticles, which controls the catalytic activity of the metal nanoparticles. Cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) is a special class of carbene that offers stronger &#963;-donation than NHCs. This extremely electron-rich nature of CAAC projects it as a better surface capping ligand upon extrapolation on the Au(0) surface. In this work, we have isolated stable CAAC-stabilized AuNPs via a ligand exchange method and studied their catalytic behavior toward electrochemical CO2 reduction. These newly synthesized CAAC-stabilized AuNPs furnish a remarkable faradaic efficiency (FE) of 94% [at pH 6.3 for 2 h of controlled potential electrolysis at &#8722;0.7 V vs NHE (normal hydrogen electrode)] toward selective CO formation. Our work sets the platform for CAAC as a robust main group ligand on the surface of different metal nanoparticles, bridging the gap between main group ligands and surface chemistry.</description>

                This study verified the axial compression load-carrying capacity of concrete column members using normal concrete and recycled aggregate concrete to achieve a carbon-neutral and resource-recycling society in concrete structures. In addition, the axial compression load-carrying capacity of adhesive-applied PCM thickness increased column members using metal-grid verified as a reinforcing method for the assumed degraded damage. The proposed reinforcing method was a high-strength non-shrink mortar increasing thickness using 2 kinds of adhesive and metal grid. The experiment evaluated the axial compression load-carrying capacity of the existing RC column and the reinforced column members by an unconfined compression test. The result shows that the proposed reinforcing method increased the axial compression load-carrying capacity of RC columns using normal concrete and recycled aggregate concrete by 2.0 times due to the confined effect of the metal-grid. Therefore, the proposed reinforcing method can extend the service life of column members using normal concrete and recycled aggregate concrete without demolition and removal. Furthermore, the using recycled aggregate concrete is expected to contribute the reduction of CO2 emissions in a resource-recycling society for concrete structures.</description>

      <title>Research on the evaluation of the renovation effect of existing energy-inefficient residential buildings in a severe cold region of China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2024.114184</link>
      <description>Hongli Cao, Xin Liu, Feng Guo, Chenchen Wang, Kailiang Huang, Xin Hou, Jiaqi Chen, Energy and buildings. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394840027

                The renovation of existing energy-inefficient residential buildings is an important measure to improve building energy efficiency and achieve CO2 emission reduction strategic tasks. At present, existing energy-inefficient residential buildings suffer from high energy consumption for heating, low efficiency, and poor indoor thermal comfort. It is necessary to implement energy-saving renovation on existing residential buildings and evaluate the renovation effect. This article took existing energy-inefficient residential buildings as the research object and selected a targeted evaluation system. Based on expert research, the hierarchical-grey correlation degree method was used to determine the weight of indices. Actual testing was conducted on the three nodes of the heat exchange station, secondary network, and the building ontology during the heating seasons of 2015&#8211;2016 and 2016&#8211;2017 (before and after renovation). Based on measured data, a fuzzy membership degree evaluation model was constructed, and the evaluation results were determined using a linear weighted method to form a complete evaluation system. The evaluation system covered 12 evaluation indices, and the evaluation indices with the largest weight in the criterion and index layer were energy consumption (0.308) and economic contribution rate (0.183), respectively. The average linear weighted evaluation scores before and after the renovation of each node were 14.16 and 29.04, respectively.</description>

      <title>Designed and Analysed of Three Distinct Composite Material-Based Mano Leaf Spring using ANSYS</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.32628/ijsrmme24822</link>

                The leaf spring is an important component in vehicles because it provides a comfortable ride and stability to the vehicle. The need to replace leaf springs with stronger and more lasting leaf springs is a key challenge in the transportation and automotive industries. In addition to offering ride comfort and stability, traditional steel leaf springs have a significant impact on the weight of the car. Fibre reinforced polymeric composites, therefore, are appropriate materials for various applications due to their many exceptional properties, including high wear resistance, high strength, long fatigue life, corrosion resistance, and low density. Fiber-reinforced polymeric composites find extensive application in several technical sectors, such as automotive, aviation, military, and marine industries. The utilization of composite materials has become imperative in the automotive industry to attain weight reduction without compromising material strength, as fuel consumption and CO2 emissions have to be reduced. In this paper, three different types of composite-based mono leaf springs were designed and examined. The results of the investigations showed that the 0&#176; unidirectional glass fiber system was unable to correctly produce the required spring rate. Consequently, many combinations of carbon and glass hybrid systems were studied. The analysis showed that the desired spring rate was produced by the material configuration of [0&#176;6G / 0&#176;2C / 0&#176;22G] S. When the final results were contrasted with the FEA findings, it was found that they concurred.</description>

      <title>Interpretable, Data-driven Models for Predicting Shaft Power, Fuel Consumption, and Speed Considering the Effects of Hull Fouling and Weather Conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnaoe.2024.100592</link>

                In response to the global call for action to reduce CO2 emissions, operational measures such as speed, route optimization, and hull cleaning play a significant role in the maritime industry. These measures can be implemented immediately without significant investment in both newbuilding ships and existing ships. To make accurate decisions regarding operational measures, reliable and precise models of environmental conditions and effects of hull fouling are required. In this study, a data-driven approach using linear regression was applied to predict shaft power, fuel consumption, and speed after intensive data preparation and feature engineering. First, a shaft power prediction model was developed by combining three independent submodels: the RPM-power model, hull fouling model, and environmental effect model. Subsequently, fuel consumption and speed prediction models were developed based on the shaft power prediction model. Model validation was performed on a 174K LNG carrier, and the results showed good accuracy even in long-term ship operations of more than two years. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of the prediction models were 1.60%, 1.70%, and 2.68% for the shaft power, fuel consumption, and speed, respectively. The validated models were applied to two LNG carriers, and satisfactory results were obtained. This study contributes to greenhouse gas (GHS) reduction by providing interpretable, flexible, and accurate models that can help make correct decisions regarding optimal operational measures.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Environmental Performance of Optimized Commercial Refrigerators with Alternative Refrigerants and Remote Monitoring System: A Cradle-to-Grave Life Cycle Assessment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e29753</link>

                Abstract Refrigerators, as other cooling systems, are responsible for a significant parcel of anthropogenic emissions since they are essential and heavy appliances that use energy during its lifespan and are loaded with refrigerant gases. Three types of commercial refrigerators and their new versions, with incorporated CO2 as refrigerant gas and an wireless system for maintenance monitoring (WSMM) were investigated to evaluate how optimization could impact on the environmental performance during their entire life cycle. This study conducted a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the refrigerators, from the production to their end-of-life. The findings revealed that the use phase and the raw materials were responsible for most of the environmental impact throughout the refrigerators' life cycle. Key impact categories such as Fossil Resource Scarcity, Freshwater Eutrophication, and Global Warming were particularly affected, largely due to the electricity mix in the use phase. Additionally, the extraction and production of raw materials, specifically steel and copper, made significant contributions to Terrestrial Ecotoxicity and Human Carcinogenic Toxicity categories. The optimization measures impacted mainly in the energy consumption during the use phase, resulting in a notable reduction of approximately 57% for models that underwent refrigerant change and 60% for the model that underwent both refrigerant change and electronic system installation. As a result of decreased energy consumption, there was a significant decrease of 13% to 16% across all impact categories, underscoring the positive environmental implications of these optimization strategies.</description>

      <title>Influence of cold rolled surface structures with undercuts for interlocking joints on bending processes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21741/9781644903131-186</link>

                Abstract. Lightweight design is one of the methods to reduce CO2 emissions and optimize energy efficiency in the transportation sector. The main motivation of this study arise from weight reduction through multi-material design with the materials commonly used in the automotive industry, steel and aluminum. Metallurgical bonding of steel and aluminum carries the risk of forming brittle intermetallic phases. Hence, new joining techniques such as joining by forming or casting are promising for these multi-material components. Previously, a hybrid component method was presented using channel-like surface structures with undercuts on a steel sheet created in a modified cold rolling process. In a subsequent high-pressure die casting, the channels were filled with aluminum melt, forming an interlocking connection as it solidified. As automotive components demand increased complexity, the bending of the structured sheet before casting was investigated. This study aims to analyze how the surface structure affects the bending process. Numerical simulations and experiments were used to investigate the effect on the maximum bending force, the resulting bending angle and springback. Therefore, the parameters bending angle, bending radius, and the lateral or longitudinal orientations of the channel structure on either sides of the bend were taken into account. The results showed a strong influence of the lateral and longitudinal orientation on the maximum bending force. Furthermore, a minor effect of the bending radius on the force and springback was found.</description>

      <title>Water Control &#8211; How to Use Oil Soluble</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/218474-ms</link>
      <description>Arne Stavland, Daniel Strand, K. Langaas, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394869667

                Abstract We describe a new concept to selectively reduce the water production from watered-out zones in oil wells: Heat an oil soluble compound to a temperature above its melting temperature and inject it into the formation as a liquid. When cooled to reservoir temperature, the chemical compound solidifies and reduces the formation permeability. Because of its oil solubility, the solidified compound is dissolved where oil is flowing. After a clean-up period, the oil permeability is fully regained. In the watered-out zones, the permeability reduction is permanent, simply because the solidified compound is not soluble in water. The concept has a large environmental improvement potential for the oil industry. By reducing production from watered-out zones, it will also reduce unwanted recycling of any injected water. Environmental savings might include power reduction and associated CO2 emission reduction linked to water treatment of produced and injected water, less need of chemicals to treat produced and injected water, and less produced water disposals to sea.Paraffin wax is a promising candidate. A paraffin wax with melting temperature of 61&#176;C was injected at 70&#176;C into a core plug. When lowering the temperature to 50&#176;C, the injected wax resulted in stable permeability reduction. Brine backproduction for extended periods did not help to regain the permeability and the water permeability changed from initially 80 md to 1 md. During oil backproduction the oil permeability regained with less than 10 pore volumes of oil. The core flooding results agree well with bulk experiments of wax solubility in oil.Warmer reservoirs require waxes (or similar compounds) with higher melting temperature. Here we report results from the use of the hard carnauba wax, with melting temperature of 84&#176;C. We confirmed that the wax melting temperature can be lowered, either by dilution of the hard wax in oil or by preparing a paraffin-carnauba blend. Core flood experiments with pure carnauba wax, carnauba wax diluted in oil and paraffin-carnauba blend all revealed excellent injectivity of the melted wax and the flow behavior was understood by two-phase oil-water flood. The water permeability, after a shut-in period, was low and stable while oil partly dissolved the solidified wax. However, the clean-up time for the carnauba-treated cores was significantly longer than for the paraffinic ones. We observed that dissolution rate depends on type of oil. Hexane (C6) revealed more rapid permeability regain than C10 and C16 alkanes. One explanation for the long clean-up period can be that the carnauba-containing waxes contributed to a more severe wetting alteration. Other wax alternatives with high melting temperature exists and are part of future research.Thinking ahead on oil field operational aspects, the concept seems ideal for low-volumes bull heading injection, where the whole near well area is treated with an invasion depth of a few feet. Temperature control of the wax before entering the porous rock will be paramount.</description>

      <title>Implications of converting native forest areas to agricultural systems on the dynamics of CO2 emission and carbon stock in a Cerrado soil, Brazil</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120796</link>
      <description>Bruna de Oliveira Silva, Mara Regina Moitinho, Alan Rodrigo Panosso, Dener M&#225;rcio da Silva Oliveira, Rafael Montanari, M&#225;rio Luiz Teixeira de Moraes, D&#233;bora Marcondes Bastos Pereira Milori, Elton da Silva Bicalho, Newton La Scala, Journal of environmental management. 358(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394903921

                The conversion of native vegetation to agricultural areas leads to a natural process of carbon loss but these systems can stabilize in terms of carbon dynamics depending on the management and conversion time, presenting potential to both store and stabilize this carbon in the soil, resulting in lower soil respiration rates. In this context, this study aimed to investigate the effect of converting native Cerrado forest areas to agricultural systems with a forest planted with Eucalyptus camaldulensis and silvopastoral systems on the dynamics of CO2 emission and carbon stock at different soil depths. The experimental sites are located in the Midwest of Brazil, in the coordinates 20&#176;22&#8242;31&#8243; S and 51&#176;24&#8242;12&#8243; W. Were evaluated soil CO2 emission (FCO2), soil organic carbon, the degree of humification of soil organic matter (HLIFS), soil temperature, soil moisture, and soil chemical and physical attributes. The soil of the area is classified as an Oxisol (Haplic Acrustox). Soil samples were collected at depths of 0.00&#8211;0.10, 0.10&#8211;0.20, 0.20&#8211;0.30, and 0.30&#8211;0.40 m. The lowest FCO2 values were found in the silvopastoral system (1.05 &#956;mol m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1), followed by the native forest (1.65 &#956;mol m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1) and the eucalyptus system (1.96 &#956;mol m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1), indicating a 36% reduction in FCO2 compared to the conversion of the native forest to the silvopastoral system and an increase of 19% when converting the native forest to the eucalyptus system. The soil chemical attributes (N, K+, Ca2+, H++Al3+, CEC, and organic carbon) showed a decrease along the profile. The shallowest depths (0.00&#8211;0.10 and 0.10&#8211;0.20 m) presented no differences between systems but the subsequent depths (0.20&#8211;0.30 and 0.30&#8211;0.40 m) had a difference (95% confidence interval), relative to N, Ca2+, H++Al3, CEC, and organic carbon stock (OCS), and the soil under silvopastoral system showed a higher concentration of these attributes than the native forest. The multivariate analysis showed that the eucalyptus and silvopastoral systems did not differ from the forest in the shallowest soil layer but differed from each other. This behavior changed from the second assessed depth (0.10&#8211;0.20 m), in which the silvopastoral system stands out, differing both from the eucalyptus system and from the native forest, and this behavior is maintained at the following depths (0.20&#8211;0.30 and 0.30&#8211;0.40 m). OCS, H++Al3, CEC, and nitrogen are strongly related to land use change for silvopastoral system. Regarding the behavior/relationship of attributes as a function of depth, the silvopastoral system contributed to soil carbon accumulation and stability over consecutive years.</description>

      <title>Gray mesoporous SnO2 catalyst for CO2 electroreduction with high partial current density and formate selectivity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.118897</link>

                The mesoporous metal oxide semiconductors exhibit unique chemical and physical characteristics, making them highly desirable for catalysis, electrochemistry, energy conversion, and energy storage applications. Here, we report the facial fabrication of mesoporous gray SnO2 (MGS) electrocatalysts employing an evaporation-induced co-assembly (EICA) approach, utilizing poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) triblock copolymers Pluronic P123 (PEO-PPO-PEO) triblock copolymer as a template for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). By sustaining the co-assembly conditions and utilizing a thermal treatment technique based on carbon, gray mesoporous SnO2 materials with a high density of active sites and oxygen vacancies can be constructed. The MGS materials were employed in eCO2RR in a flow cell type, which exhibits excellent catalytic activity and selectivity toward formate with a high partial current density of -234 mA cm-2 and Faradic efficiency (FE) of 93.60 % at -1.3 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Interestingly, the mesoporous SnO2 with a 1.5 wt% ratio of Sn precursor to P123 surfactant (MS-1.5@350N-400A) electrode exhibits a high level of Faradaic efficiency (FE) of (98%) at a low overpotential of -0.6 VRHE, which is a seldom recorded performance for similar systems. A stable FE of 96 &#177; 1% was observed in the range of -0.6 to -1.2 VRHE, which is the result of a large surface area (184 m2 /g) and a high number of active sites and oxygen vacancies within the mesostructured framework.</description>

                Transition metal oxides (TMOs) are widely studied for loading of various catalysts due to their low cost and high structure flexibility. However, the prevailing close-packed nature of most TMOs crystals has restricted the available loading sites to surface only, while their internal bulk lattice remains unactuated due to the inaccessible narrow space that blocks out most key reactants and/or particulate catalysts. Herein, using tunnel-structured MnO2, we demonstrate how TMO's internal lattice space can be activated as extra loading sites for atomic Ag in addition to the conventional surface-only loading, via which a dual-form Ag catalyst within MnO2 skeleton is established. In this design, not only faceted Ag nanoparticles are confined onto MnO2 surface by coherent lattice-sharing, Ag atomic strings are also seeded deep into the sub-nanoscale MnO2 tunnel lattice, enriching the catalytically active sites. Tested for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR), such dual-form catalyst exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency (94%), yield (67.3 mol/g/h) and durability (&#8764; 48 h) for CO production, exceeding commercial Ag nanoparticles and most Ag-based electrocatalysts. Theoretical calculations further reveal the concurrent effect of such dual-form catalyst featuring facet-dependent eCO2RR for Ag nanoparticles and lattice-confined eCO2RR for Ag atomic strings, inspiring the future design of catalyst-substrate configuration.

                In the past four years, the number of prosumers utilizing photovoltaic (PV) installations in Poland has increased significantly, exceeding 1.3 million, reaching a total power capacity of 10.5 GW by the end of 2023. This paper presents a three-year energy yield analysis of the prosumer PV systems operating in Eastern Poland. The 9.6 kW system consists of high-efficiency monocrystalline photovoltaic modules in half-cut technology. Over the three years of operation, specific yields have been analyzed along with weather parameters, such as solar intensity, outdoor temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, or snowfall. The average annual final yield was found to be relatively high, exceeding 1000 kWh&#183;kW&#8722;1 in each of the analysed years. The highest monthly specific yields of the analysed period were noticed during the summer, reaching the maximum value of 164 kWh&#183;kW&#8722;1 in 2022. The daily final yields varied from a minimum of 0.15 kWh&#183;kW&#8722;1 in Winter 2021 to a maximum of 6.8 kWh&#183;kW&#8722;1 in Spring 2022. Weather conditions increasing the energy yields, such as low average ambient temperatures together with high insolation periods, were noticed. Energy production in such favorable conditions reached a surprisingly high value of energy yield in April 2020, comparable to the summer months (151.0 kWh&#183;kW&#8722;1). The occurrence of heavy rainfall in summer was also noted as a desirable effect that leads to the natural cleaning of the PV modules. The average performance ratio during the analyzed period was found to be 0.85. The energy production of the PV system allowed the reduction of about 21 tons of CO2 emission.</description>

                Biodiesel and alcohols are only two of the numerous alternative fuels that have found widespread commercialization in the transportation and industrial sectors. Cottonseed oil and n-octanol piqued our curiosity again in this regard. The engines used in the experiments are single-cylinder four-stroke diesel engines with a power output of 1.5 kW. The tests are run at 1500 rpm with varying loads on the diesel, cottonseed oil, and graphene mixtures. i.e., BB1(Diesel 75%+ Cottonseed biodiesel 20%+ n-Octanol 5%), BB2(Diesel 75%+ Cottonseed biodiesel 20%+ n-Octanol 5%+ nanographene 25ppm), BB3(Diesel 75%+ Cottonseed biodiesel 20%+ n-Octanol 5%+nanographene 50ppm), BB4(Diesel 70%+ Cottonseed biodiesel 20%+ n-Octanol 10%), BB5(Diesel 70%+ Cottonseed biodiesel 20%+ n-Octanol 10%+ nanographene 25 ppm), BB1(Diesel 70%+ Cottonseed biodiesel 20%+ n-Octanol 10%+ nanographene 50ppm). The findings indicate that incorporating cottonseed oil leads to an improvement in brake thermal efficiency, along with a decrease in specific fuel consumption and exhaust gas temperature. By increasing the amount of cottonseed oil in the blend, the emission parameters such as CO, CO2, NOx, and O2 are reduced, while HC emissions increase. Adding n-octanol and graphene to the cottonseed oil blend diesel fuel has a comparable impact to adding pure cottonseed oil in different proportions. This leads to an increase in brake thermal efficiency, a decrease in specific fuel consumption, and a reduction in exhaust gas temperature.</description>

      <title>Impact of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microplastic on growth, photosynthesis and nutrient uptake of Solanum lycopersicum L. (Tomato)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2024.123994</link>
      <description>Nuamzanei, Udeshna Changmai, Sahana SK, Niraj Kumar, Bhogeswar Borah, Channakeshavaiah Chikkaputtaiah, Ratul Saikia, Tridip Phukan, Environmental pollution. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394832344

                Microplastics (MPs) pollution and their impact on plants have become a global threat, but their effect at the molecular level remains scarce. This study aims to gain insight into the effects of polyvinylchloride microplastic (PVC-MP) on tomato plants at the genetic and protein levels. In this study, we found that increasing concentrations of PVC-MP (2.5, 5,7.5, and 10% w/w) in the soil did not cause any phytotoxic (chlorosis or necrosis) symptoms but it did result in a dose-dependent reduction in plant growth-related parameters, such as height, leaf area, stem diameter, and plant fresh and dry weight. Additionally, the number of secondary roots was reduced while the primary roots were elongated. Furthermore, PVC-MP also caused a significant decrease in light-harvesting pigments chlorophylls, and carotenoids while increasing the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation in plants. Microscopic analysis of the roots revealed the uptake of PVC-MP of size less than 10 &#956;m. Micro- and macro-element analysis showed changes in concentrations of Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, and Zn, upon PVC-MP exposure. Results from western blotting and q-PCR showed that higher doses of PVC-MP significantly reduced the CO2-fixing enzyme RuBisCO and D1 proteins of PSII at both protein and transcript levels. These findings suggest that lower levels of light-harvesting pigments, D1 protein, RuBisCO, and modulation of nutrient absorption are among the factors responsible for growth suppression in tomato plants upon exposure to PVC-MP. As tomato plants are economically significant crops, an increase in PVC-MP in agricultural fields may have a detrimental influence on crop production, resulting in economic loss.</description>

                Abstract Solar energy, which is widely acknowledged for its economic feasibility and sustainable nature, functions as a critical substitute for finite fossil fuels, effectively alleviating ecological consequences. The purpose of this study is to investigate the implementation of solar collectors as a means of harnessing the ample and unaltered solar radiation in Iran, specifically in locations situated within the solar belt. The incorporation of solar energy not only aids in the expansion of energy sources through diversification but also mitigates the rising expenses linked to fossil fuels. The preservation of natural resources, coupled with limited renewable energy options, further accentuates the importance of solar energy. The optimization of solar panel collector angles in photovoltaic systems assumes paramount importance for maximizing energy efficiency. This study, conducted in Yazd, Iran, utilized innovative mathematical and particle swarm optimization (PSO) models to assess ideal inclination angles. Results indicate peak solar energy absorption during June and July, contrasting with minimal absorption in January. The Klein model prescribes inclination angles based on &#947; values, while the PSO algorithm determines optimal slope and azimuth angles across various periods. Significant enhancements in energy generation, ranging from 23.24 to 25.02% across optimization models, were observed compared to a horizontal surface. These findings underscore the imperative of optimizing solar panel placement in urban settings to augment energy generation. Utilizing the optimal orientation for the photovoltaic power supply system can result in an annual reduction of 1169.6 kg of CO2 emissions in the building, emphasizing the positive environmental impact achievable through strategic solar panel configurations.</description>

      <title>Air quality and heath co-benefits of low carbon transition policies in electricity system: The case of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad3f33</link>

                Abstract Low carbon transition strategies of power plants are crucial to meet China&#8217;s &#8220;Dual Carbon&#8221; targets. While the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, the &#8220;capital economic circles&#8221; of China, is suffering from serious air pollution, air quality co-benefits of low carbon transition policies in electricity system in BTH area remain unclear. Here, we estimate the impacts of low carbon transition policies, including one BAU, six single and five combined scenarios, in electricity system in BTH area on installed power capacity, CO2 emissions, air quality and human health through 2060 based on OSeMOSYS and ERSM models. Results show that the total installed capacity under single and combined scenarios (except RE and Tech single scenarios) fluctuates around the BAU level of 310.5 GW in 2060. While all single and combined scenarios would generally achieve &#8220;carbon peak&#8221; in BTH electricity system before 2030, only S4 (combining technological progress, renewable energy development and CCUS) and S5 (in additional to S4, including gas-fired power generation instead of coal-fired power generation) scenarios have the potential to realize carbon neutrality by 2060. The magnitude of reductions in air pollutant emissions and improvement in air quality in BTH area from the BAU level in 2060 under combined scenarios, especially S4 and S5, generally exceed that of six single scenarios. Importantly, S5 in 2060 contributes to about 8,528 avoided premature mortalities in BTH area, which are more effective than any other scenarios. The results suggest that S5 is a promising low carbon transition policies to achieve environmental improvement and produce health benefits.</description>

      <title>Cold Ironing and the Study of RES Utilization for Maritime Electrification on Lesvos Island Port</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/environments11040084</link>
      <description>Alexandros Kelmalis, Andreas Dimou, Dimitrios Lekkas, Stergios Vakalis, Environments. 11(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394972284

                The maritime industry is addressing environmental issues, and &#8220;cold ironing&#8221; offers a promising solution. This method involves supplying ships at port with energy, reducing fossil fuel dependence and emissions, and aiding in global climate change efforts. It is especially important for islands like Lesvos, which suffer from high energy costs and environmental issues due to imported fossil fuel reliance. However, research gaps exist in using renewable energy sources (RES) for cold ironing, mainly due to insufficient data on power needs and lack of monitoring for precise calculations and the very limited applications for the case of non-interconnected islands. This study uses real data from the port of Lesvos to evaluate power requirements for cold ironing and assesses the viability of a wind power park for an electrified port with the novelty and uniqueness of developing the application on a non-interconnected island. It also examines potential CO2 emission reductions. Data from Marine Traffic S.A. were used, considering factors like ship arrivals, hoteling duration, and engine types. This study also includes a simulation using RETScreen software for a 20 MW wind park intended for port operations. The findings show that the monthly energy demand at Mytilene port is around 6118 MWh, with an average power demand of 8.2 MW. The simulated wind park could supply about 72,080 MWh yearly, with a significant surplus (14,956 MWh annually) exportable to the grid. However, demand fluctuations mean the port might need an extra 924 MWh from the main grid. This underscores the need for additional strategies like energy storage and demand&#8211;response practices to fully transition to 100% RES-powered operations.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence-Centric Low-Enthalpy Geothermal Field Development Planning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17081887</link>
      <description>Torsten Clemens, Maria-Magdalena Chiotoroiu, Anthony Corso, Markus Zechner, Mykel J. Kochenderfer, Energies. 17(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394854530

                Low-enthalpy geothermal energy can make a major contribution towards reducing CO2 emissions. However, the development of geothermal reservoirs is costly and time intensive. In particular, high capital expenditures, data acquisition costs, and long periods of time from identifying a geothermal resource to geothermal heat extraction make geothermal field developments challenging. Conventional geothermal field development planning follows a linear approach starting with numerical model calibrations of the existing subsurface data, simulations of forecasts for geothermal heat production, and cost estimations. Next, data acquisition actions are evaluated and performed, and then the models are changed by integrating the new data before being finally used for forecasting and economics. There are several challenges when using this approach and the duration of model rebuilding with the availability of new data is time consuming. Furthermore, the approach does not address sequential decision making under uncertainty as it focuses on individual data acquisition actions. An artificial intelligence (AI)-centric approach to field development planning substantially improves cycle times and the expected rewards from geothermal projects. The reason for this is that various methods such as machine learning in data conditioning and distance-based generalized sensitivity analysis assess the uncertainty and quantify its potential impact on the final value. The use of AI for sequential decision making under uncertainty results in an optimized data acquisition strategy, a recommendation of a specific development scenario, or advice against further investment. This approach is illustrated by applying AI-centric geothermal field development planning to an Austrian low-enthalpy geothermal case. The results show an increase in the expected value of over 27% and a reduction in data acquisition costs by more than 35% when compared with conventional field development planning strategies. Furthermore, the results are used in systematic trade-off assessments of various key performance indicators.</description>

                In recent years, waste-to-energy systems are receiving more attention due to their dual benefit of reduction of pollution caused by waste materials and reducing the overconsumption of fossil fuels. Since plastic waste is readily available and has a high heating value, it is a viable source of energy.; plastic garbage makes an excellent source of energy. Today, a feedstock made up of several types of plastic is used to quickly pyrolyze and produce plastic pyrolysis oil (PPO) or waste plastic oil (WPO). The oil could be utilized in internal combustion engines to produce heat and power. In the current work, waste polythene covers were transformed into value added products by utilizing fly ash catalyst and oil obtained is examined for suitability to run the diesel engine. In the primary phase simulation study is performed on a four-stroke single cylinder DI Compression ignition engine using Diesel-RK engine simulator, results indicated that, waste plastic oil was found to emit higher oxides of nitrogen compared to diesel therefore in the secondary phase the same engine simulated by implementing exhaust gas recirculation at 3.5%,7%,10.5% and 14% rates. In the end engine parameters get optimized using 3D parametric optimization technique. Simulation Results indicate that, Performance parameters such as brake power, brake thermal efficiency &amp; brake specific fuel consumption were found to be decreased slightly under EGR conditions. Furthermore, Combustion parameters such as cylinder pressure and cylinder temperature decrease up on implementing the exhaust gas recirculation, similarly the emission characteristics such as CO2, PM and smoke found to be increase with increase in EGR ratio while Oxides of nitrogen emissions significantly decreased under EGR conditions. In order to reduce the emissions further, A 3D parametric optimization technique was adopted and optimal results obtained when engine runs at compression ratio of 16.49, injection timing of 18.21 and EGR percentage of 5.2%.</description>

      <title>0462 Polysomnographic Biomarkers of Sleep Disruption and Incident Migraine in a Large Clinical Cohort</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsae067.0462</link>

                Abstract Introduction The relationship between sleep disruption characterized by polysomnography and migraine development remains unclear. This study elucidates this association, examining whether indices of sleep disturbance could serve as predictors of migraine. Methods In this longitudinal study, 132,705 participants (2000 to 2023) without pre-existing migraines were analyzed. Predictors included Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI), Mean SaO2, arousal index, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores. Covariates for adjustment comprised age, sex, body mass index (BMI), race, neck size, end-tidal CO2, sleep stage percentages, and household income. Migraine incidence was ascertained using ICD diagnosis codes. Analysis employed univariable and multivariable Cox regression models. Results The cohort averaged 50.2 &#177; 19.0 years, was 54% male, and 76% Caucasian. Mean follow-up was 4.8 &#177; 4.1 years until migraine incidence. Adjusted regression showed higher AHI (per 5 units) was associated with a 1% reduction in migraine risk (HR=0.989, 95% CI 0.986-0.992). Also, higher mean SaO2 predicted a 4% increase in migraine incidence (HR=1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.06). Reduced N1 percentage (HR=0.993, 95% CI 0.988-0.999), lower arousal index (per 1 unit, HR=0.993, 95% CI 0.991-0.996), and higher income (per $10,000, HR=0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.98) also decreased migraine development. However, elevated ESS scores (HR=1.04 per unit increase) and larger neck sizes (HR=1.005 per 1 cm) augmented migraine risk (both p&amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion More severe sleep disruption correlated with reduced migraine incidence, contrasting expectations. Apnea-induced vasoconstriction may trigger protective vascular changes in calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)/serotonin pathways. Further study on mediating mechanisms is warranted.

      <title>Advancing Silicon-Based Photoelectrodes toward Practical Artificial Photosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/accountsmr.4c00022</link>

                ConspectusArtificial photosynthesis is a sustainable technology to convert solar energy into storable chemicals or fuels, which potentially paves the way for coping with the greenhouse gas emission and growing energy demand. Semiconductor photoelectrodes are vital constituents in artificial photosynthesis systems. Among them, silicon (Si) is extensively employed due to its earth abundance, suitable band gap, and low cost. However, Si-based photoelectrodes suffer from insufficient photovoltage, serious interfacial charge recombination, sluggish reaction kinetics, and low stability in electrolyte.Numerous strategies have been proposed to address these challenges. Si-based photoelectrodes comprising buried junctions, passivation/protective layers, and electrocatalysts as the main components have thus been developed. Unfortunately, several issues persist: (1) the additional defect state at the newly formed interfaces; (2) the contradiction between adequate passivation/protection and sufficient charge transfer; (3) the parasitic light absorption of electrocatalyst; and (4) the lack of compatibility with different application scenarios. Therefore, it is paramount to meticulously balance the functionalities and potential detrimental impacts brought about by different components to govern the photoelectrode design.This Account describes recent advances in Si-based photoelectrode design toward high efficiency, excellent stability, and practical applications in artificial photosynthesis. The charge utilization efficiency is determined by charge generation, separation, and transport processes, which could be simultaneously improved by the careful designs of homo/heterojunctions, bifacial passivation, and illumination-reaction decoupling. The above methods have been proven to be efficient, as through them we have obtained benchmark Si-based photocathodes. Apart from efficiency, stability is another key factor. We explored the charge transport and deactivation mechanisms of the traditional metal oxide protective layers, varied the coverage and surface energy of organic protective layers to control the flux of photogenerated charge, and discussed the merits of metal protective layers in illumination-reaction decoupled photoelectrodes. Moreover, the versatility of our Si-based photoelectrodes in unbiased water splitting with separated and integrated configurations, as well as in CO2 reduction with H-cell and flow cell, is proposed. Finally, the key challenges and future perspectives toward practical artificial synthesis are suggested. Our collective work outlines strategies for efficient and stable Si-based photoelectrodes. These general methods may be applicable to other semiconductor photoelectrodes for artificial synthesis.</description>

                Abstract Introduction Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an effective therapy for epilepsy that has previously been suggested to worsen obstructive and central sleep apnea. Management of medically complex patients in the traditional sleep laboratory can present logistical barriers given the minimal medical oversight. Innovative forms of sleep monitoring offer new options to evaluate sleep serially. Report of case(s) A 69-year-old female with a history of medically refractory generalized epilepsy, on a vagal nerve stimulator, presented to sleep clinic in September of 2022 after undergoing a polysomnogram significant for severe sleep apnea with AHI 3% of 56, AHI 4% of 48, and oxygen nadir of 83%. A November 2022 titration was unsuccessful (residual AHI of 48 and oxygen desaturation nadir of 88%). Periodic breathing proved refractory to CPAP, BiPAP, BiPAP S/T, adaptive servo-ventilation, and attempts to mitigate high loop gain physiology with CO2 modulation techniques, acetazolamide, and supplemental oxygen. VNS setting could not be manipulated in the sleep laboratory safely. She was placed on CPAP setting of 5-10 cm H2O with compliance data showing average residual AHI of 24.3 and 29% of nights being in Hunter-Cheyne-Stokes breathing (HCSB). A planned hospital admission in July 2023 was arranged to monitor sleep with the SleepImage Ring system, which offered measurement of AHI and periodicity without the need for manual scoring. The VNS battery proved depleted during the stay but 5 nights on the same CPAP settings with the VNS off showed a residual AHI 4% of 1-3 with minimal periodic breathing. Patient underwent replacement of VNS generator with reduction of output current to 1/3 of prior value with gradual up-titration. Subsequent CPAP compliance data showed gradual increase in AHI and periodic breathing with rising VNS setting. Currently, the patient is undergoing VNS adjustments to optimize seizure control with plans to restudy sleep breathing at lower nocturnal settings when stabilized. Conclusion Sleep apnea induced by VNS can be refractory to therapy. Tracking sleep with the SleepImage system and PAP compliance data allowed understanding of the role of neurostimulation in inducing sleep dysfunction.

This provides opportunities to develop sustainability initiatives to reduce environmental impacts. GOR initiatives require buy-in and execution from various stakeholders, including hospital administration, clinical staff, and support teams. Our objective is to share easy-to-implement strategies that reduce costs and improve sustainability through reductions in environmental/climate impact in the OR that Urologists' can lead. METHODS: A retrospective assessment of a single large cancer center's GOR efforts from a prospectively maintained sustainability dashboard. RESULTS: In 2022, our GOR initiative saved 1.8 million kWh in electricity, decreased greenhouse gas emissions by 148%, avoided 150 tons of waste, and recycled 14,000 kbs of single-use devices (SUD) leading to an overall savings of $1,112,505 (Figure 1). A few high-impact easily implemented initiatives contributing to savings include: Energy consumption: Computer power on/off software programs, turning off OR monitors/lights at the end of the day, switching OR lights to LED, and HVAC (air exchange) setbacks using CO2 sensors to decrease exchanges when the room is not in use. Waste reduction: Standardizing case carts, switching from single-use-plastic to reusable equipment, recycling SUD (ligatures, staplers, blood pressure cuffs, O2 sensors, compression devices, etc.), recycling/repurposing sterile blue wrap, and donating unwanted medical equipment. Anesthetic gases: Reducing Nitrous oxide, desflurane, sevoflurane, and isoflurane use, and increasing the use of monitored sedation or regional anesthesia, when possible, helps reduce anesthetic gas use. Education and collaboration: Educating staff by placing recycling signage in every OR, using color-coded recycling bin/bags to help with waste segregation, nominating champions within OR staff, environmental services, and other stakeholders helps align everyone toward a common goal and identify areas for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: We present easily implemented high-impact GOR initiatives aligned with industry best practices that any Urologist can initiate to kickstart a GOR program in their own organization and reduce the environmental/climate impacts of healthcare in their community.

      <title>81 Effectiveness of Simultaneous Intense Pulsed Light and Fractional CO2 Laser Therapy in Hypertrophic Burn Scars</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/jbcr/irae036.080</link>
      <description>Djoni Elkady, Brandon Larson, Steffi Sharma, Richard B Lou, Anjay Khandelwal, Journal of burn care &amp; research. 45(Supplement_1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394892770

                Abstract Introduction Hypertrophic burn scars present challenges for patients and clinicians. Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) and Ablative Fractional CO2 Lasers (AFCL) have shown promise in scar treatment by targeting vascular structures and promoting collagen production. While IPL-AFCL has been used in managing hypertrophic scarring in various dermatological conditions, limited data exist for burn scar treatment. In addition, scar vascularity can frequently limit the depth of penetration and density of AFCL yielding delayed results. The author's conducted a study assessing the efficacy of simultaneous IPL-AFCL therapy on hypertrophic burn scars using the Modified Vancouver Scar Scale (MVSS). To the author's knowledge, this is the first reported case series of simultaneous laser treatment in the treatment of hypertrophic burn scars. Methods In this retrospective study (April 2021 to July 2023), data from patients (pediatric and adult) receiving at least two IPL-AFCL treatments were analyzed. Demographics, burn details, and complications were collected. Linear regression assessed the impact of time from burn to first treatment on MVSS scores. Unpaired t-tests compared pre/post-MVSS scores for partial-thickness (PT) and full-thickness (FT) burns, and paired t-tests evaluated pre/post-treatment MVSS score differences after IPL-AFCL treatment. Results The study involving 33 patients (11 PT burns, 22 FT burns), the mean pre-MVSS score was 12.09 &#177; 2.77, and post-MVSS score was 6.24 &#177; 2.96. IPL-AFCL significantly reduced MVSS scores by a mean of 5.85 &#177; 0.43 (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) with an average of 3.70 &#177; 1.69 IPL-AFCL treatments per patient. Significant reductions were also observed in pigmentation (p=0.001), vascularity, pliability, height, pain, and pruritus (p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Linear regression analysis showed that the duration from burn injury to the first laser treatment significantly influenced pre-MVSS scores (p=0.008) but not post-MVSS (p=0.062). No significant differences were found in pre-MVSS (p=0.186) and post-MVSS (p=0.233) scores between PT and FT burns. As for complications, 4/33 patients experienced blistering following treatment which did not result in any long-term consequences. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that IPL-AFCL treatment effectively improved hypertrophic burn scars. MVSS scores did not significantly differ between PT and FT burns, but the time from the initial burn to the first treatment significantly influenced pre-MVSS scores. Applicability of Research to Practice Simultaneous use of different light/laser modalities is safe and effective and may offer advantages with symptomatic, functional and cosmetic benefits.</description>

A tiered causal analysis focuses resources on key questions and guides the effort. The methodology has been used in national and international disputes. This chapter describes the method along with providing an overview of data quality objectives as this is an essential aspect of achieving parity regarding the evaluation of alternative causes. The methodology is illustrated using examples involving damages to vegetation, implications of sediment contamination, the decline of bee colonies, and the evaluation of toxicity in effluents.

While important, testing can be costly, unnecessary and burdensome to patients to obtain G&amp;S in a short timeframe due to expiry. We aimed to assess and reduce unnecessary G&amp;S testing in a safe and collaborative manner through a Transfusion Dashboard. We assessed the effect of reduced G&amp;S testing on cost and the environment. METHODS: The Transfusion Dashboard (TD), launched at UBC in 2020, is a quality improvement initiative which tracks procedure-specific transfusion rates. Based on initial findings, recommendations for pre-operative G&amp;S for endoscopic procedures were developed. We reviewed incidence of G&amp;S testing, perioperative transfusion rates and rescue transfusion rates (when a patient without G&amp;S needs urgent, uncrossed transfusion) in endourological procedures before and after the implementation of this initiative with the chi-squared test. We also assessed cost and environmental savings. RESULTS: From 2016-2023, outcomes were tracked for 4393 pre-TD initiative and 2058 post-TD initiative patients who underwent endoscopic procedures (Table 1). We found a statistically significant decrease in G&amp;S testing post-TD for TURP, PNL, HoLEP, and TURBT by as much as 63.6% (Table 1, p&lt;0.001). There was no change in uncrossed or overall blood transfusions (0% for all groups). In 2022, for TURP alone, this resulted in a total saving of $1947 and reduction of 40Kg in CO2 emissions by eliminating 75 patient visits to the laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: Institutional and procedure specific G&amp;S testing guidelines decrease unnecessary tests, leading to improved resource stewardship, reduced cost, respecting patients' time, and environmental savings. While the cost savings per group is modest, care improvements may be amplified safely in larger organizations and across more procedures.

Owing to its closed carbon cycle, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on foreign fuels. The disadvantages of biodiesel include an increase in nitrogen oxide emissions, its incompatibility with cold weather, and the necessity of replacing engine parts such as fuel filters, fuel tanks, and fuel lines due to clogging on a regular basis. By using 2D nanomaterials as fuel additives, it is possible to improve the properties of fuels and overcome their shortcomings. Recent investigations on fuel-added substances showed the consideration of 2D nano-sized particles (metallic, non-metallic, oxygenated, natural, and blended) with diesel-biodiesel fuel emulsions. The thermophysical properties were improved, the heat transfer rate was increased, and the fuel mixtures were stabilized. In addition, depending on the dosage of the 2D nanofluid additives, the engine performance parameters increased, and the exhaust emissions decreased. The dispersion of 2D nanoparticles in liquid fuel and the effect of adding these particles on the performance and emission parameters of diesel engines are covered in this chapter.

The supporting regulatory impact assessments focus largely on the extent to which the regulatory alternatives are likely to achieve goals in a cost-benefit analysis. Critics have questioned the estimated magnitude, policy propriety, and legal basis of counting co-benefits. This chapter examines the controversy that co-benefits are overstated, or that other countervailing risks and costs are neglected. It argues in favor of counting the full portfolio or scope of important policy impacts, both benefits and harms. The chapter examines the treatment of ancillary impacts in case studies that address environmental policies under the Obama, Trump and Biden Administrations. It advocates estimating the full scope of important impacts to the extent caused by the policy option, and to the extent relevant to improving the policy process and decision.
