      <title>Unravelling the Effect of Crystal Facet of Derived&#8208;Copper Catalysts on the Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide under Unified Mass Transport Condition</title>

                Altering the physical structure and chemical property of copper, i.e., particle size, surface morphology, composition or crystal facet, has been demonstrated to be effective in steering the selectivity of products in electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. However, these modifications generally result in the change of active surface area, leading to differences in the geometric current density and local pH, which are also demonstrated to be the key factors for observed selectivity change. In this work, we deconvolute the effect of mass transport and local pH from the effect of crystal facet by investigating five copper&#8208;based catalysts with identical roughness factors for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in an H&#8208;cell. Interestingly, CuO&#8208;derived catalyst stands out as the best catalyst for C&#8208;C coupling. At &#8208;1.07 V vs. RHE, the faradaic efficiency of C2+ product reaches 44.3%, with a partial current density of &#8208;10.8 mA cm&#8208;2. Electrochemical adsorption of *OH reveals that the C2+ product selectivity of derived&#8208;copper catalysts correlates positively with the ratio of Cu(100)/Cu(110) of five catalysts. Additionally, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the percentage of low&#8208;frequency band linear CO (LFB&#8208;CO), which is attributed to the adsorbed *CO on Cu(100) facet, increases with the C&#8208;C coupling efficiency.</description>

      <title>Cu-supported ZnO in Conditions of CO2 Reduction to Methanol: Why 0.2 ML Coverage?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-nbz3p</link>

                By hydrogenating carbon dioxide to value-added products such as methanol, heterogenous catalysts can lower greenhouse gas emissions and generate alternative, liquid fuels. The most common commercial catalyst for CO2 reduction to methanol is Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, where ZnO improves conversion and selectivity toward methanol. The structure of this catalyst is thought to be Zn oxy(hydroxyl) overlayers at the nanometer scale on Cu. In the presence of CO2 and H2 under reaction conditions, the Cu substrate itself can be restructured and/or partially oxidized at its interface with ZnO, or the Zn might be reduced, possibly completely to a CuZn alloy, making the exact structure and stoichiometry of the active site a topic of active debate. In this study, we examine Zn3 clusters on Cu(100) and Cu(111), as a sub-nano model of the catalyst. We use a grand canonical genetic algorithm to sample the system structure and stoichiometry under catalytic conditions: T = 550 K, initial partial pressures of H2 = 4.5 atm and CO2 = 0.5 atm, and 1% conversion. We uncover a strong dependence of the catalyst stoichiometry on surface coverage. At the optimal 0.2 ML surface coverage, chains of Zn(OH) form on both Cu surfaces. On Cu(100), the catalyst has many thermally accessible metastable minima, whereas on Cu(111), it does not. No oxidation or reconstruction of the Cu is found. However, at lower coverage of Zn, Zn3 clusters take on a metallic form on Cu(100), and slightly oxidized Zn3O on Cu(111), while the surface uptakes H to form a variety of low hydrides of Cu. We thus hypothesize that the reason the 0.2 ML Zn coverage is optimal, as found experimentally, is the stronger yet incomplete oxidation afforded by Zn at this coverage.</description>

      <title>On the electrochemical CO2 reduction by Bi-based catalysts: single
  crystals or mixture phases</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2409.11648</link>
      <description>M. Zhou, Hongxia Liu, Juntao Yan, Nanjun Chen, Rong Chen, Lei Liu, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403719594

                Metallic bismuth is both non-toxic and cost-effective. Bi-based catalysts have demonstrated the ability to efficiently produce HCOOH through CO2RR while effectively inhibiting the HER. Although many experiments have been reported concerning its performance towards CO2 reduction, the impact its valence states and crystal faces on CO2RR selectivity (e.g. HCOOH versus CO) it still under debate. Here, we performed a comprehensive study via density functional theory, by including three typical valence states of Bi, such as 0 (Bi), +3 (Bi2O3) and +5 (Bi2O5), as well as their often-studied crystal facets. The results show that metallic Bi demonstrates a poor selectivity for HCOOH, but boasts a higher conversion rate for CO2. While Bi2O3 exhibits a good selectivity for HCOOH production, yet it displays a lower conversion rate for CO2. For Bi2O5, all studied surfaces show high energy barriers in both cases of HCOOH and CO production, and lower energy barriers for HER reactions, indicating that Bi at +5 valence state is not the good choice for 2e transfer reactions. Subsequently, we further examined the effects of oxygen contents on the selectivity of HCOOH and the conversion rate for CO2. Interestingly, we found that partial oxidization of Bi benefits both the selectivity and the conversion rate. With these observations, we suggest that a mixture of Bi (0) and Bi2O3 (+3) phases would be a better choice than single crystals for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Economic Analysis of Advanced Ultra-Supercritical Pulverized Coal Power Plants: A Cost-Effective CO2 Emission Reduction Option?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.31399/asm.cp.am-epri-2010p0053</link>

                Abstract A recent engineering design study conducted by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) has compared the cost and performance of an advanced ultra-supercritical (A-USC) pulverized coal (PC) power plant with main steam temperature of 700&#176;C to that of conventional coal-fired power plant designs: sub-critical, supercritical, and current USC PC plants with main steam temperatures of 541&#176;, 582&#176;, and 605&#176;C, respectively. The study revealed that for a US location in the absence of any cost being imposed for CO2 emissions the A-USC design was a slightly more expensive choice for electricity production. However, when the marginal cost of the A-USC design is compared to the reduction in CO2 emissions, it was shown that the cost of the avoided CO2 emissions was less than $25 per metric ton of CO2. This is significantly lower than any technology currently being considered for CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Additionally by lowering CO2/MWh, the A-USC plant also lowers the cost of CCS once integrated with the power plant. It is therefore concluded that A-USC technology should be considered as one of the primary options for minimizing the cost of reducing CO2 emissions from future coal power plants.</description>

                Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) was investigated in either organic or aqueous/organic media by employing three water-soluble [RhIIICp*(LH2)Cl]+ (LH2 = n,n&#8217;-dihydroxy-2,2&#8217;-bipyridine; n = 4, 5, or 6) in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH) and triethanolamine (TEOA). Through studying the electron-donating effects of two hydroxyl groups introduced to the bipyridyl ligand, we found that the substituent positions greatly affect both the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in CO2 reduction. More importantly, the HCOOH selectivity shows a dramatic increase from 14% to 83% upon switching the solvent media from pure organic to aqueous/organic mixture, where the H2 selectivity shows a reverse phenomenon. The enhanced HCOOH selectivity and the drastic decrease in the H2 yield are well rationalized by the fact that the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is not only driven photochemically via the attack of RhIII(H)Cp*(LH2-&#8226;) on CO2 but also partly bypassed by a dark H2 addition reaction yielding [RhIII(H)Cp*(L)]- from [RhIIICp*(L)Cl]+, which was also separately investigated under the dark conditions. Combination of experimental and theoretical approaches were made to clarify the pKa values of catalyst intermediates together with the abundant species responsible for the major catalytic processes. Our DFT studies unveil that the exceptionally large structural strain given by the steric contacts between the 6,6&#8217;-dihydroxyl groups and the Cp* moiety plays a significant role in bringing about an outstanding catalytic performance of the 6,6&#8217;-subsituted derivative. The intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were carried out to clarify the mechanism of hydride transfer steps leading to generate formate together the heterolytic H2 cleavage steps leading to afford the key hydridorhodium intermediates. This study represents the first report on the water-induced high selectivity in CO2-to-HCOOH conversion, shedding a new light on the strategy to control the efficiency and selectivity in the catalysis of CO2 reduction.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the potential of deep eutectic solvents in biocatalysis: design strategies using CO2 to formate reduction as a case study</title>

                Introduction Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have emerged as green solvents with versatile applications, demonstrating significant potential in biocatalysis. They often increase the solubility of poorly water-soluble substrates, serve as smart co-substrates, modulate enzyme stereoselectivity, and potentially improve enzyme activity and stability. Despite these advantages, screening for an optimal DES and determining the appropriate water content for a given biocatalytic reaction remains a complex and time-consuming process, posing a significant challenge. Methods This paper discusses the rational design of DES tailored to a given biocatalytic system through a combination of experimental screening and computational tools, guided by performance targets defined by solvent properties and process constraints. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by the reduction of CO 2 to formate catalyzed by NADH-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH). By systematically analyzing FDH activity and stability, NADH stability (both long-term and short-term stability after solvent saturation with CO 2 ), and CO 2 solubility in initially selected glycerol-based DESs, we were able to skillfully guide the DES screening process. Results and discussion Considering trade-offs between experimentally determined performance metrics of DESs, 20% solution of choline chloride:glycerol in phosphate buffer (ChCl:Gly 80%B ) was identified as the most promising solvent system for a given reaction. Using ChCl:Gly as a co-solvent resulted in an almost 15-fold increase in FDH half-life compared to the reference buffer and stabilized the coenzyme after the addition of CO 2 . Moreover, the 20% addition of ChCl:Gly to the buffer improved the volumetric productivity of FDH-catalyzed CO 2 reduction in a batch system compared to the reference buffer. The exceptional stability of the enzyme in this co-solvent system shows great potential for application in continuous operation, which can significantly improve process productivity. Additionally, based on easily measurable physicochemical solvent properties and molecular descriptors derived from COSMO-RS, QSAR models were developed, which successfully predicted enzyme activity and stability, as well as coenzyme stability in selected solvent systems with DESs.</description>

                Selective CO2 hydrogenation faces significant technical challenges, although many efforts have been made in this regard. Herein, a Ni-doped In2O3 catalyst supported by g-C3N4 was prepared using the co-precipitation method, and its composition, morphology, specific surface area, and band gap were characterized using TEM, XPS, BET, XRD, CO2-TPD, H2-TPR, UV-Vis, etc. The catalytic hydrogenation reduction of CO2 to produce methanol was tested. Under low-photothermal conditions (1.0 MPa), the hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to methanol is stable, effective, and highly selective, with a spatiotemporal yield of 86.0 gMeOHh&#8722;1 kgcat&#8722;1, which is 30.9% higher than that of Ni-In2O3 without g-C3N4 loading under the same conditions.</description>

      <title>The Synergy Between CO2 and Air Pollution Emissions in Chinese Cities by 2060: An Assessment Based on the Emissions Inventory and Dynamic Projection Model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16219338</link>
      <description>Guosheng Wang, Wei Xia, Yang Xiao, X. L. Guan, Xin Zhang, Sustainability. 16(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403834976

                Synergizing air pollution control and climate change mitigation has been of significant academic and policy concern. The synergy between air pollution and carbon emissions is one of the measures to understand the characteristics and process of the air pollution&#8211;carbon synergistic control, which will also provide valuable information for collaboratively achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (such as SDGs 11 and 13). This study establishes a systematic framework integrating emissions inventory and projection models, correlation mining and typology analysis methods to predictively evaluate the synergy and comprehensive coordination between air pollution and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Chinese cities by 2030, 2050, and 2060 under different policy scenarios for air pollution and CO2 emissions control. The results reveal the significant effects of synergistically implementing clean air and aggressive carbon-reducing policies on mitigating air pollution and CO2 emissions. Under the On-time Peak-Net Zero-Clean Air and Early Peak-Net Zero-Clean Air scenarios, the total reduction and synergy for air pollution and CO2 emissions will be more significant, particularly by 2050 and 2060. This study is the first to integrate scenario projection and synergy evaluation in air pollution and CO2 research, providing a novel supplement to the air pollution&#8211;climate change synergy methodology based on co-benefit estimation. The methods and findings will also contribute to measuring the achievement and analyzing the interaction of the SDGs.</description>

      <title>Balancing Progress and Preservation: The Complex Interplay of Economic Growth and Forest Conservation in Nepal&#8217;s Carbon Dioxide Emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/7562668</link>
      <description>Omkar Poudel, Pradeep Acharya, Sarad Chandra Kafle, Basanta Prasad Adhikari, Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society. 2024(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403700992

                The intricate relationship between economic growth, environmental quality, and energy consumption has been extensively debated and studied on a global scale. The impacts of ecological quality on economic growth have been observed to be both positive and negative, particularly about human health as a result of pollutant emissions. It is essential to examine the compatibility between economic growth and environmental improvement, particularly through the reduction of emissions. This study aimed to investigate the connection between economic growth in forested areas and the corresponding impact on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Nepal (Rose and Fisher, 1970). The analysis utilized time series data from 1990 to 2020, employing the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) method. The DOLS results demonstrated a positive and statistically significant relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions (Shafik and Bandyopadhyay, 1992). Specifically, an increase of Rs. 10 million in gross domestic product (GDP) corresponded to a 0.6112 kiloton increase in CO2 emissions. In contrast, the long&#8208;term coefficient for forested areas exhibited a substantial association, indicating that a reduction of one square kilometer of forested area (deforestation) resulted in an increase of 68.37 kilotons in CO2 emissions in Nepal. These findings accentuate the divergent effects of economic progress and deforestation on carbon emissions in Nepal, with GDP growth contributing to a greater increase in emissions. Therefore, the implementation of effective strategies and economic measures, such as afforestation and reforestation, forest protection, sustainable forest management, and mechanisms like REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation plus), can play a vital role in mitigating carbon emissions while simultaneously addressing deforestation and ensuring long&#8208;term economic progress in Nepal.</description>

Mihalopoulos, Atmosphere. 15(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403843514

                This study provides an overview of the atmospheric drivers of climate change over Greece (Eastern Mediterranean), focusing on greenhouse gases (GHG: carbon dioxide, CO2; methane, CH4; etc.). CO2 in Greece is mostly produced by energy production, followed by transport, construction, and industry. Waste management is the largest anthropogenic source of methane, accounting for 47% of total CH4 emissions, surpassing emissions from the agricultural sector in 2017, while the energy sector accounts for the remaining 10.5%. In situ simultaneous observations of GHG concentrations in Greece conducted at three sites with different topologies (urban background; Athens, regional background; Finokalia and free troposphere; and Helmos) during the last 5 years (2019&#8211;2023) showed increasing trends of the order of 2.2 ppm&#183;yr&#8722;1 and ~15 ppb&#183;yr&#8722;1 for CO2 and CH4, respectively, in line with the global trends. These increasing trends were found from both ground-based and satellite-based remote-sensing observations. Finally, during the lockdown period due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, a 58% reduction in CO2 levels was observed in the urban background site of Athens after subtracting the regional background levels from Finokalia, while the respective reduction in CH4 was of only the order of 15%, highlighting differences in emission sources.</description>

      <title>CO2 Methanation: A Bibliometric Analysis and Review of Activated Carbon-Based Materials (2014 &#8211; 2024)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/ce/zkae082</link>
      <description>Stephen Okiemute Akpasi, Yusuf Makarfi Isa, Thembisile Patience Monama, Sammy Lewis Kiambi, Peterson Thokozani Ngema, Clean Energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403851253

                Abstract This study highlights the significant potential of activated carbon-based materials in environmental remediation and energy production, particularly in converting carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) into methane (CH4) and water (H2O) using transition metal-based catalysts. It emphasizes the role of porous AC in waste reduction and resource utilization, examining various applications of CO2 and evaluating environmental impacts. The research explores commercialization opportunities and specifically investigates CO2 methanation using activated carbon-based materials. Using bibliometric analyses of 4196 articles from the Web of Science database, the study identifies a growing research interest in porous activated carbon-related CO2 methanation from 2014 to 2024. The top three journals in this field are Environment Development and Sustainability, Biomass Conversion and Biorefinery, and Journal of Environment Science and Pollution. However, there is limited inter-institutional collaboration in this field, suggesting room for development towards commercializing sustainable CH4 production pathways. CH4 is highlighted as a crucial intermediate in industrial processes, and research directions are identified through co-occurring author keywords analysis. The study suggests the need for a comprehensive approach integrating activated carbon materials into carbon-neutral energy processes while addressing the potential adverse effects of activated carbon nanoparticles on biological and environmental factors. Ultimately, it clarifies the potential uses and commercialization prospects for porous AC materials, especially in conjunction with carbon capture and utilization technologies, promoting sustainable practices in energy production and environmental management.</description>

                Optimizing the binding energy between the intermediate and the active site is a key factor for tuning catalytic product selectivity and activity in the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Copper active sites are known to reduce CO2 to hydrocarbons and oxygenates, but suffer from poor product selectivity due to the moderate binding energies of several of the reaction intermediates. Here, we report an ion exchange strategy to construct Cu&#8208;Pd paddle wheel dimers within Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu3&#8208;xPdx(BTC)2] (BTC = benzentricarboxylate), without altering the overall MOF structural properties. Compared to the pristine Cu MOF ([Cu3(BTC)2], HKUST&#8208;1), the Cu&#8208;Pd MOF shifts CO2 electroreduction products from diverse chemical species to selective CO generation. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis of the catalyst oxidation state and local geometry, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that the incorporation of Pd within the Cu&#8208;Pd paddle wheel node structure of the MOF promotes adsorption of the key intermediate COOH* at the Cu site. This permits CO&#8208;selective catalytic mechanisms and thus advances our understanding of the interplay between structure and activity toward electrochemical CO2 reduction using molecular catalysts.</description>

                This study aimed to investigation was carried out to evaluate the performance and product emission of four cylinder 4- stroke water cooled direct injection (DI) diesel engine fueled by permanent magnet exposed diesel fuel compared with diesel fuel (DF). Three levels of magnet field intensity were used including Diesel fuel exposer to 3000 Gauss (DG3), Diesel fuel exposer to 5000 Gauss (DG5) and Diesel fuel exposer to 9000 Gauss (DG9) fuel respectively. Permanent magnetic device was employed and installed on fuel line before interring high pressure fuel injection pump . The engine run at constant speed 1500rpm(revolution per minute) and loaded by two levels 4.5 kW and 9 kW represented as L1and L2 respectively. Results obtained showed that fuel DG5 registered an increased in thermal efficiency(TE) about 20.09% at load L1 compared with DF. Maximum reduction in brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) about 12.12%, when using DG5 fuel at load 1 compared to DF fuel. All exhaust emission Unburned Hydrocarbon (UHC), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Carbon Dioxide (CO2),Particular Maters (PM), and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) are decreased when diesel fuel treated with different magnetic intensities 3000,5000 and 9000 Gauss. Compared with conventional diesel fuel. Maximum reduction in PM,HC,NOx,CO2,and CO about 16.56-27.08%, 3.89&#8211;64.26%, 4.79&#8211;7.91%, 4.05-5.71and 11.46-53.48% respectively. CO2 emission was increased by 1.65-4.28 at DG5 with L1 and L2 respectively due to the operating conditions.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Potential for the Application of Peanut Shells as a Reducer in the Process of Metal Recovery from Metallurgical Slags</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16219261</link>

                Copper production technology is a complex process consisting of many stages. The combination of pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical stages, on the one hand, complicates production while, on the other hand, allowing for a relatively selective separation of intermediate or waste materials that can be subjected to the process of recovery of useful components. Materials of this type are characterised by a much higher copper content relative to the ore material. On the other hand, due to the oxide form, reduction processes are used in which coke is mainly applied. Reduction of the unfavourable phenomenon of CO2 emissions, in this case, can be performed through the use of bioreducers, which are characterised by an inert carbon footprint since the generation of carbon dioxides is the same as its absorption at the stage of vegetation and growth. In this paper, the topic of determining the feasibility of using selected bioreducers, such as peanut shells, to verify their suitability in the process of reducing copper oxides as well as the impact on the working components of the laboratory reactor in which the process is carried out are discussed. In this case, raw materials with a composition similar to the that of slags produced at the copper production stage in a flash furnace were tested for reduction. The results referring to reducing lead and copper contents above 88% Pb and 98% Cu indicate the great potential of this type of bioreducer. An additional advantage is the relatively wide availability of peanut resources. The effects of the copper reduction time on the degree of decopperisation performed with a constant reducer addition at 1300 &#176;C were studied in this paper. Following 1 h of the process, the copper content in the slag was 0.78 wt%, while the longer process duration resulted in a copper fraction of 0.19 wt%. Considering lead, its content was 0.33 wt% after the reduction process.</description>

      <title>Energy Price Distortions and Urban Carbon Emission Efficiency: Evidence from China&#8217;s Energy-Intensive Sectors</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16219351</link>

                With a primary focus of achieving carbon neutrality, the energy-intensive industrial sectors (EIIs) contribute to more than half of China&#8217;s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. During the process of China&#8217;s rapid economic development, distorted energy prices gradually became the main obstacle to energy conservation and emission reductions in the EIIs. Therefore, this study focused on determining the mechanisms affecting the energy price distortions of carbon emission efficiency (CEE) in China&#8217;s EIIs. Based on a stochastic frontier analysis, the changing trend of CEE in China&#8217;s EIIs was evaluated. The channels impacting the energy price distortions of CEE were further analyzed by a mediating effect and moderated mediating effect model. The main contributions and findings include the following: energy price distortions have a significant negative impact on CEE by suppressing technological innovations and hindering the restructuring of energy consumption; governmental environmental regulatory policies mitigate their suppressing effect on technological innovations and reduce the preventing effect by improving the energy consumption structure. The results suggest that market-based price reforms and moderate environmental regulation by the government could help to improve CEE in China&#8217;s EIIs. These findings are of great significance for promoting the sustainable development of the energy-intensive industrial sectors and achieving carbon neutrality.</description>

                Abstract Background As a significant contributor to secondary energy production, the power generation industry has a considerable reliance on fossil fuels. It is a significant source of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, making it a key target for emission reduction in environmental protection. This study is focused on the power generation industry in Anhui Province, China. The LMDI decomposition model and the LEAP model are employed to establish five emission reduction scenarios, which were used to forecast future trends in carbon dioxide and air pollutant emissions in the power generation sector from 2022 to 2035. Results The results indicate that the implementation of comprehensive measures for the promotion of washed coal technology, improvements in thermal power efficiency, and the substitution of clean energy, carbon dioxide, and atmospheric pollutants will reach their peak in 2027, achieving the most optimal emission reduction effects. The analysis of the synergistic emission reduction effects demonstrates that the implementation of comprehensive measures yields the most optimal reduction in carbon dioxide and atmospheric pollutants. Furthermore, the comprehensive scenario exhibits a considerable emission reduction contribution rate. Conclusions For the power generation industry in Anhui Province, the simultaneous implementation of three emission reduction measures represents the optimal path for synergistic improvement in pollution reduction and carbon reduction. These measures provide policy recommendations for the power generation industry in other regions seeking to achieve pollution and carbon reduction.</description>

      <title>Interventions to reduce low-value care in intensive care settings: a scoping review of impacts on health, resource use, costs, and the environment</title>

                Low-value care is common in intensive care units (ICUs), unnecessarily exposing patients to risks and harms, incuring costs to the patient and healthcare system, and contributing to healthcare's carbon footprint. We aimed to identify, collate, and summarise published evidence on the impact of interventions to reduce low-value care in ICUs. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL from inception to 22 September 2023 for evaluations of interventions aiming to reduce low-value care, supplemented by reference lists and recently published articles. We recorded impacts on the low-value target, health outcomes, resource use, cost, and the environment. From 1155 studies screened, 32 eligible studies were identified evaluating interventions to reduce: routine blood testing (n = 13), routine chest X-rays (n = 10), and other types (or multiple types) of low-value care (n = 9). All but 3 of the interventions found reductions in the immediate low-value care target (usually the primary outcome). Although the small sample size of most included studies, limited their ability to detect impacts on other outcomes, many interventions were also associated with improved health outcomes and financial savings. The only study that reported environmental impacts found the intervention was associated with reduced carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) emissions. Interventions to reduce low-value care in ICUs may have important health, financial, and environmental co-benefits. Further research may inform wider scale-up and sustainability of successful strategies to decrease low-value healthcare.

                As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, international cooperation and effective policy tools are crucial for reducing carbon emissions and achieving a sustainable future. This study uses a game-theoretical approach to investigate the negotiations between countries with high and low carbon dioxide emissions, with the goal of achieving zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. By fostering collaboration and understanding among nations, game theory provides a robust framework for addressing the complexities of global climate policy. Game theory provides a mathematical framework to model strategic behaviors in climate negotiations between high and low carbon dioxide-emitting countries. By analyzing the payoff functions, the Nash equilibrium strategies for emission reduction efforts are derived. The introduction of a carbon tax increases the marginal cost of emissions, leading to higher equilibrium efforts by both country groups. Simulation results indicate a significant increase in emission reductions with the tax, demonstrating the tax&#8217;s effectiveness in incentivizing climate action and contributing to global mitigation efforts. This result highlights the potential economic benefits of carbon taxation, including innovation incentives and reduced emissions, which can drive sustainable economic growth and job creation. However, the study also acknowledges potential costs, such as impacts on economic competitiveness and distributional fairness, which must be carefully considered and addressed in policy design. This research offers valuable insights for policymakers, highlighting the importance of crafting carbon tax policies that maximize environmental benefits while minimizing adverse economic and social effects. By balancing these considerations, policymakers can develop more effective strategies that support both environmental sustainability and economic resilience.</description>

                Abstract Many ports serve ships on a first-come-first-serve (FCFS) basis leading to negative environmental impacts due to ships &#8220;hurrying up to wait&#8221; if berths are not ready forcing them to idle at anchorage. Besides the fuel consumption used at elevated speed to be in good time in the port area, average anchorage times can account for 5 &#8722; 10% of ship voyage durations during which ships still emit carbon dioxide (CO2) while running auxiliary engines consuming ca. 15% of the voyage&#8217;s marine fuel. Ships deciding to skip or reshuffle port calls due to this might enforce this practice which can result into overall uncertainty, unbalanced port resource utilization including congestion and logjams rippling entire industries. Congested port areas complicate traffic management of arriving and leaving ships. The need to establish a comprehensive system for managing arrivals and departures becomes even more pressing in the case of damaged ships or accidents. Besides, early communicating terminal and port readiness notices allows ships to adjust their speed and save fuel of up to 21% of the overall voyage. Information technological advances made great progress by optimizing individual ship voyages. However, the optimization of cargo transport within a system which can also take into account real-time safety levels of ships, is still unsolved. In this paper, we review past research on just-in-time (JIT) port call optimization (PCO), its challenges, and its way forward through digitalization efforts to achieve desperately needed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions.</description>

                Climate change is a global concern driven by greenhouse gas emissions. Bangladesh, being densely populated and a significant carbon emitter, must urgently reduce its &#8220;carbon-dioxide emissions&#8221;. The primary objectives of this research are to meticulously examine the impact of green growth, non-renewable energy, renewable energy, and technological innovations on carbon dioxide emissions in Bangladesh from 1990 to 2020, with the goal of informing policies for effective and sustainable climate change mitigation in Bangladesh. The analysis using advanced econometric methods, including autoregressive distributed lag, fully modified ordinary least squares, and canonical cointegration regression, reveals that green growth and technological innovations have adverse long-term but positive short-term effects on carbon emissions in Bangladesh. Additionally, it is noteworthy that both non-renewable and renewable energy sources significantly contribute to long-term and short-term carbon emissions. The study confirms the Environmental Kuznets Curve, showing a &#8220;&#8745;&#8221; shaped relationship between green development and carbon emissions. Policymakers should prioritize green growth, incentivize technological innovation, promote sustainable economic practices, and implement comprehensive energy transition strategies. The insights from this study inform policy formulation to address the complex relationships between green growth, energy sources, and carbon-dioxide emissions for sustainable climate change mitigation in Bangladesh. Bangladesh&#8217;s efforts contribute to global emission reduction and foster a resilient future.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Effect of Crystal Facet of Derived&#8208;Copper Catalysts on the Electroreduction of Carbon Dioxide under Unified Mass Transport Condition</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202415590</link>
      <description>Zi-Hao Zhao, Dan Ren, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403790287

                Altering the physical structure and chemical property of copper, i.e., particle size, surface morphology, composition or crystal facet, has been demonstrated to be effective in steering the selectivity of products in electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. However, these modifications generally result in the change of active surface area, leading to differences in the geometric current density and local pH, which are also demonstrated to be the key factors for observed selectivity change. In this work, we deconvolute the effect of mass transport and local pH from the effect of crystal facet by investigating five copper&#8208;based catalysts with identical roughness factors for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in an H&#8208;cell. Interestingly, CuO&#8208;derived catalyst stands out as the best catalyst for C&#8208;C coupling. At &#8208;1.07 V vs. RHE, the faradaic efficiency of C2+ product reaches 44.3%, with a partial current density of &#8208;10.8 mA cm&#8208;2. Electrochemical adsorption of *OH reveals that the C2+ product selectivity of derived&#8208;copper catalysts correlates positively with the ratio of Cu(100)/Cu(110) of five catalysts. Additionally, in situ Raman spectroscopy reveals that the percentage of low&#8208;frequency band linear CO (LFB&#8208;CO), which is attributed to the adsorbed *CO on Cu(100) facet, increases with the C&#8208;C coupling efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Present Net Impact Value for the Atmospheric Emission of Forest Carbon from Harvested Wood Products</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s10666-024-10009-7</link>
      <description>Eric Marland, Gregg Marland, Keith D. Stockmann, Environmental Modeling &amp; Assessment. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403711296

                Abstract With emerging issues of global climate change, it is clear that there is value in controlling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Managing the release or uptake of carbon by forests is an important opportunity to yield reductions in atmospheric CO 2 , and this includes managing the amount of harvested forest carbon that is stored in harvested wood products (HWP). To evaluate the contribution of forest carbon to climate change, we need to evaluate how much carbon is released to the atmosphere, when it is released, how long the released C remains in the atmosphere, and our preference for the timing and amplitude of climate change. When forest is harvested, the subsequent amount of carbon in the atmosphere depends on the processes and efficiency of harvest, the life times of the forest products, and the treatment of forest products at the end of their useful lifetime. This paper assembles extensive US data on the fractions of forest carbon that are released to the atmosphere during the processing of a forest harvest and the production and life expectancy of harvested wood products (HWP). Using a model of the global carbon cycle and an illustrated treatment of time preference, we calculate the relative cost of different forest management scenarios in terms of the ton years of CO 2 in the atmosphere. We show that delaying the emission of one ton of C as CO 2 for 1 year yields a reduction of 41.74 ton years of carbon in the atmosphere when integrated to infinite time and using a low time preference of 1% per year. Alternate scenarios of forest harvest and product management can be compared against this scenario to compare their relative impact on global climate change.</description>

      <title>Impact of Carbon Tax on Renewable Energy Development and Environmental&#8211;Economic Synergies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17215347</link>
      <description>Keying Feng, Jing Wang, Yu Zhuo, Lili Jiao, Bowen Wang, Zhi Liu, Energies. 17(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403836366

                Global warming caused by greenhouse gas emissions has become a worldwide environmental problem, posing a great threat to human survival. As the world&#8217;s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, China has pledged to reach peak carbon emissions by no later than 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. It is found that a carbon tax is a powerful incentive to reduce carbon emissions and promote an energy revolution, but it may have negative socio-economic impacts. Therefore, based on China&#8217;s 2020 input&#8211;output table, this paper systematically investigates the impacts of a carbon tax on China&#8217;s economy, carbon emissions, and energy by applying a computable general equilibrium model to determine the ideal equilibrium between socio-economic and environmental objectives. Based on energy use characteristics, we subdivided the energy sector into five major sectors: coal, oil, natural gas, thermal power generation, and clean power. The results show that when the carbon emission reduction target is less than 15%, that is, when the equilibrium carbon tax price is less than 54 yuan/ton, the implementation of a carbon tax policy can significantly reduce carbon emission and fossil fuel energy consumption, while only slightly reducing economic growth rate, and can achieve the double dividend of environment and economy. Moreover, because the reduction of coal consumption has the greatest impact on reducing carbon emissions, the ad valorem tax rate on coal after the carbon tax is imposed is the highest because coal has the highest carbon emission coefficient among fossil fuels. In addition, as an emerging clean energy source, hydrogen energy is the ideal energy storage medium for achieving clean power generation in power systems. If hydrogen energy can be vigorously developed, it is expected to greatly accelerate the deep decarbonization of power, industry, transportation, construction, and other fields.</description>

                This study analyzes the variability of carbon dioxide emissions across Asia, revealing that China, India, and Indonesia are the primary contributors with extremely high average emissions and standard deviations. The GSTAR(3;1,1,1) model has been shown to be optimal for forecasting future emissions, based on lower RMSE and MAPE values. Ordinary Kriging analysis using the isotropic spherical semivariogram model provides the most accurate predictions for unobserved areas, with contour maps indicating that the northeastern region of Asia will continue to face high emission concentrations until 2027. While countries such as Brunei and Armenia have managed to keep emission levels low, the instability of emission trends across Asia underscores the need for emission reduction strategies tailored to the specific context of each country.</description>

                Abstract NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatories (OCO&#8208;2 and OCO&#8208;3) provide measurements of column&#8208;averaged carbon dioxide concentrations (XCO 2 ) with sufficient spatial resolution and precision to constrain bottom&#8208;up estimates of CO 2 fluxes at regional scales. We use Bayesian inversion methods assimilating satellite retrievals to improve estimates of CO 2 fluxes in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) which surrounds Los Angeles, and in the San Francisco Bay Area Air Basin (SFBA). We study 2020 to understand the impact of the COVID&#8208;19 lockdowns and an active wildfire season. Our results indicated that a 50% (30%) reduction in CO 2 emissions relative to 2015 during the COVID&#8208;19 lockdown period was consistent with OCO measurements for SFBA (SoCAB). We find that posterior wildfire emissions differed significantly from the prior at the scale of individual wildfires, though with large uncertainties, and that wildfire emissions in SFBA are significant, attributing 72% of the region's CO 2 emissions during August 2020 to wildfires.</description>

                The electrochemical reduction of riboflavin (vitamin B2) in a dimethyl sulfoxide solvent was examined under a CO2 atmosphere and compared with results under an argon atmosphere. Variable-scan-rate cyclic voltammetry combined with controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) and analysis by UV&#8211;vis and EPR spectroscopies provided insights into the nature of interactions of reduced flavins with dissolved CO2. Reductive exhaustive CPE experiments under CO2 indicated an overall two-electron stoichiometry, compared to one-electron reduction under an argon atmosphere, due to the lowering of the formal one-electron reduction potential of the flavin radical anion to form the dianion, which can be rationalized by riboflavin&#8211;CO2 molecular interactions. UV&#8211;vis spectroscopic measurements confirmed complete chemical reversibility of the redox transformations over extended time scales. Digital simulation modeling of the voltammetric data enabled extraction of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for the proposed mechanism, comprising multiple proton-coupled electron transfer steps, diamagnetic anions, radical anions, and neutral radical intermediates enroute to the fully reduced state, as well as evidence of a long-lived solution phase complex of the reduced riboflavin with CO2.</description>

      <title>Efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction Reaction on Cu-Decorated Biphenylene</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c08499</link>

                Developing efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction into value-added products is crucial for a green economy. Inspired by the recent experimental synthesis of biphenylene (BPH) and the excellent catalytic activity of copper dispersed on two-dimensional (2D) materials, we chose to systematically investigate the pristine, defective, and Cu-decorated BPH for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to value-added hydrocarbons. It is observed that the CO2 molecules bind weakly to the pristine BPH, indicating their chemical inertness. Carbon single-vacancy defects facilitate CO2 adsorption with a strong binding energy (Eb) of &#8722;3.23 eV, detrimental to the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) mechanism. We have further investigated the binding energy and kinetic stability of Cu-decorated BPH as a single-atom-catalyst (SAC). The molecular dynamics simulations confirm the kinetic stability, revealing that the Cu-atom avoids agglomeration under low metal dispersal conditions. The CO2 molecule gets adsorbed horizontally on the Cu-BPH surface with a &#916;Eb of &#8722;0.52 eV. The CRR mechanism is investigated using two pathways beginning with two different initial states, formate (*OCOH) and carboxylic (*COOH). The formate pathway confirms the conversion of *OCOH to *HCOOH with the rate-limiting potential (UL) of 0.39 eV for the production of HCOOH, while for the carboxylic pathway, the conversion of *COH to *CHOH has a UL of 0.32 eV, eventually producing CH3OH. Our findings highlight the role of Cu-BPH as an efficient SAC for CO2 catalytic activity to C1 products, as compared to the state-of-the-art Cu, and holds promise as an electrocatalyst for CRR.</description>

                ABSTRACT The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (eCO 2 RR) is a promising technology for synthesizing value&#8208;added products required in the transition towards a more circular and renewable&#8208;based economy. In this context, the electrochemical production of formic acid has the potential to become economically competitive to energy&#8208;demanding conventional synthetic methods, thereby presenting a sustainable alternative. However, to enhance energy efficiency and selectivity toward the targeted product significant technological improvements in key components (e.g., electrodes, catalysts, electrolytes, membranes, cells, solvents) are required. Over recent years, our research has focused on understanding the influence of catalyst, gas diffusion electrode (GDE) architecture and performance, and cell design in the eCO 2 RR to formic acid. This perspective article provides an overview of the current status of these specific components, as well as our insights and those of other researchers, regarding potential future investigations and applications.</description>

                This 42nd volume of the International Journal of Sustainable Energy Planning and Management includes two articles from the 2023 Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environmental Systems (SDEWES) conference series as well as two ordinary articles. The two first articles establish links between the energy systems analysis model EnergyPLAN and respectively the Quintel Energy Transition Model (ETM) and urban building energy modelling to form more comprehensive modelling environments. Third, an article addresses energy systems modelling from a more spatial perspective, with the presentation of the ODHeatMap tool to model the spatial characteristics of heat demand particularly in areas where optimal energy planning data may not be available. Lastly, Vietnam&#8217;s economy and energy demand is increasing rapidly, and, in this issue, analyses are presented regarding how ambitions measures in renewable energy utilization and energy efficiency improvements have to beer under different scenarios, for Vietnam to reach its carbon dioxide emission reduction goal.</description>

      <title>Coupling Conversion of CO2 and High&#8208;carbon Alkane to CO and Gasoline</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202401546</link>

                Catalytic conversion of CO2 to valuable products is a promising way to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emission. Herein, a strategy for coupling conversion of CO2 and high&#8208;carbon alkane to CO and gasoline is developed, which is a feasible choice for the combination of CO2 recycling and petroleum refining. The CO2 conversion reaches 2.6% under mild condition (270 &#176;C), and the selectivity of gasoline in the cracking products exceeds 70 wt%. Additionally, the introduction of CO2 improves the selectivity of aromatic hydrocarbons and increases the octane number of gasoline. Mechanism studies indicate that synergistic effect between Br&#248;nsted acid centers and Ni sites on the Beta zeolite supported Ni (20 wt%) catalyst (20Ni/&#946;) plays the key role in alkane cracking and CO2 reduction. Notably, 13CO2 isotopic experiments show that the hydrogen produced during the aromatization can be captured by CO2, inhibiting undesired hydrogen transfer pathways and enhancement the yield of aromatics, while CO2 is converted into valuable CO.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Interlayer Microenvironment of 2D Layered Double Hydroxides for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction with Enhanced C&lt;sub&gt;2+&lt;/sub&gt; Production</title>

                Abstract Both the physicochemical properties of catalytic material and the structure of loaded catalyst layer (CL) on gas diffusion electrode (GDE) are of crucial importance in determining the conversion efficiency and product selectivity of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). However, the highly reducing reaction condition of CO 2 RR will lead to the uncontrollable structural and compositional changes of catalysts, making it difficult to tailor surface properties and microstructure of the real active species for favored products. Herein, the interlayer microenvironment of copper&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) is rationally tuned by a facile ink solvent engineering, which affects both the surface characters and microstructure of CL on GDE, leading to distinct catalytic activity and product selectivity. According to series of in situ and ex situ techniques, the appropriate surface wettability and thickness of porous CL are found to play critical roles in controlling the local CO 2 concentration and water dissociation steps that are key for hydrogenation during CO 2 RR, leading to a high Faradaic efficiency of 75.3% for C 2+ products and a partial current density of 275 mA cm &#8722;2 at &#8722;0.8 V versus RHE. This work provides insights into rational design of efficient electrocatalysts toward CO 2 RR for multi&#8208;carbon generation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Flame Retardancy in Epoxy Resin with Clever Self-Assembly Method for Optimizing Interface Interaction via Well-Dispersed Cerium Oxide on Piperazine Pyrophosphate</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/fire7110372</link>
      <description>Jiajun Zhao, Zhaoyang Wu, Yutong Hong, Hongyu Li, Jin Qian, Kai Wu, Yan Xia, Fire. 7(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403689902

                Developing flame-retardant epoxy resins (EPs) is essential to broaden their industrial applications, as their inherent flammability restricts their widespread use. In this study, commercial cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles were modified with oleic acid and successfully assembled onto the surface of pyrophosphate piperazine (PAPP) through a simple solvophobic effect, constructing an integrated superstructure flame retardant, CeO2@PAPP, with enhanced performance integration. Compared to traditional simple blends, the EP composite with 10 wt% CeO2@PAPP displayed superior flame retardancy, thanks to the more subtle synergistic effects between flame retardant components and their favorable interface interactions. The EP composite achieved a UL-94 V-0 rating and increased the limiting oxygen index (LOI) to 34.2%. Significant reductions of 56.3% in peak heat release rate (PHRR) and 38.2% in total heat release (THR) were observed. Furthermore, total smoke release (TSR), carbon monoxide yield (COPR), and carbon dioxide yield (CO2PR) decreased by 52.2%, 50.2%, and 67.3%, respectively. Through comprehensive and detailed characterization, it was discovered that the assembled integrated CeO2@PAPP flame retardant can perform better in both the gas phase and condensed phase, resulting in superior flame-retardant properties. This study offers an effective strategy for developing highly flame-retardant EPs, thereby expanding their potential applications across various industries.</description>

      <title>Investigating proton shuttling and electrochemical mechanisms of amines in integrated CO2 capture and utilization</title>

                Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies present a promising solution for converting CO2 emissions into valuable products. Here we show how amines, such as monoethanolamine (MEA) and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), influence the electrochemical CO2 reduction process in an integrated CCU system. Using in situ spectroscopic techniques, we identify the key roles of carbamate bond strength, proton shuttling, and amine structure in dictating reaction pathways on copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) electrodes. Our findings demonstrate that on Cu electrodes, surface blockage by ammonium species impedes CO&#8322; reduction, whereas on Pb electrodes, proton shuttling enhances the production of hydrocarbon products. This study provides additional insights into optimizing CCU systems by tailoring the choice of amines and electrode materials, advancing the selective conversion of CO&#8322; into valuable chemicals. Integrated carbon capture and utilization (CCU) systems offer a sustainable approach to converting CO&#8322; emissions into valuable chemicals. Here, the authors report the choice of amine and electrode materials significantly impact the efficiency and selectivity of CO2 reduction in CCU processes.</description>

      <title>The Promoting Effect of Green Bonds on Reducing Carbon Emission Intensity Through Energy Structure Transition</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16219318</link>
      <description>Yulei Zhang, Tao Xu, WU Song-qiang, Sustainability. 16(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403810162

                Climate change poses a significant threat to the sustainable development of all countries. The transition to low-carbon energy sources is a crucial strategy for reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change. We investigate the mediating role of clean energy consumption (EC) and fossil energy supply (ES) on the promoting of carbon emission intensity per unit of GDP (CO2/GDP) reduction by green bonds (GBs). We develop a mediating model to analyze how GB influences CO2/GDP reduction through EC and ES, utilizing panel data from 13 prefecture-level cities in Jiangsu province spanning the years 2007 to 2021. Additionally, we assess the model&#8217;s reliability through endogeneity and robustness tests. We find that GBs contribute to reducing CO2/GDP by facilitating the structural transition of energy supply and consumption. Furthermore, the development of GBs enhance the consumption of clean energy and plays a direct role in advancing the transition in structure of both energy supply and energy consumption. Notably, we observe heterogeneity in the effectiveness of GBs on CO2/GDP reduction across different regions. Therefore, it is imperative for the government to actively promote the development of GBs to achieve sustainable economic growth. Furthermore, both financial and energy policies should be tailored to align with the specific energy structures of various regions.</description>

      <description>R. Blum, J. Bugge, No host. 84659(None)] 2010. https://openalex.org/W4403684189

                Abstract This paper examines the ongoing significance of pulverized coal-fired steam plants in global power generation, focusing on technological advancements and strategies for improving efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions. It traces the development of Ultra-Supercritical (USC) plants with steam temperatures around 600&#176;C and explores immediate opportunities for further efficiency enhancements, including the innovative Master Cycle. The potential for increasing steam temperatures to 650&#176;C using new steels and to 700&#176;C with nickel-based AD 700 technology is discussed. The paper outlines a comprehensive strategy for CO2 emission reduction: maximizing plant efficiency, co-firing with CO2-neutral fuels, and integrating with district heating/cooling or industrial heat consumers. Carbon capture and storage techniques are presented as a final step in this multi-faceted approach to sustainable power generation.</description>

                TThis works proposes modifications to the values of input parameters in widely accepted semi-analytical models of thermodynamic properties of hydrogen and its binary mixtures to improve their prediction accuracy. The modifications include characterization parameters for the Peng and Robinson Equation of State (PR-EoS), the Jossi-Stiel-Thodos (JST)/Lohrenz-Bray-Clark (LBC) viscosity correlation, and the Chung-Lee-Starling (CLS) thermal conductivity correlation, applicable to pure hydrogen and its binary mixtures containing methane, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The changes preserve the mathematical structure of the models and ensure their compatibility with existing commercial packages. We consider temperatures ranging from 90 K (triple point of methane) to 1000 K, and pressures ranging from atmospheric up to 100 MPa. The revised characterization parameters of hydrogen lead to a reduction in the Absolute Average Deviation (AAD) of the PR-EoS calculation for hydrogen density from 2.76% (with a maximum of 8.05%) down to 0.182% (with a maximum of 1.9%). For the JST/LBC viscosity correlation, the AAD decreases from 11.82% (with a maximum of 54.3%) to 4.08% (with a maximum of 13%). Regarding thermal conductivity, the adjustments for the CLS correlation results in the AAD decreasing from 36% (with a maximum of 44%) to 2.14\% (with a maximum of 12.1%). Binary interaction parameters for gaseous mixtures containing hydrogen and phase equilibria calculation are also proposed. Finally, we investigage optimal mixing rules parameters for viscosity and thermal conductivity of mixtures for more accurate predictions of mixtures? transport properties.</description>

      <title>Application of magnesium-containing fertilizers by priming method for regulation of physiological processes in winter wheat</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.32634/0869-8155-2024-387-10-122-127</link>
      <description>Dmitry Zakharov, &#1045;. &#1042;. &#1057;&#1090;&#1077;&#1087;&#1072;&#1085;&#1086;&#1074;&#1072;, I. A. Ivanochkin, Agrarian science. 1(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403767866

                The studing the efficiency of new magnesium-containing fertilizer &#8220;AktiMax&#8221; use for priming soft winter wheat seeds of the &#8220;Skipetr&#8221; variety. The effect of the fertilizer is compared with the negative (no fertilizer) and positive (&#8220;Novosil&#8221;) controls. During the study, the optimal concentration 2.6 ml/l of the solution for processing by the selected method is found, which is equivalent to 20% of the recommended by the manufacturer (13 ml/l). At treating with a solution of this concentration, a slight decrease in seed germination is observed, and growth parameter records taken after 7 days showed an increase in leaf length by 15&#8211;20%. A slight decrease in the number of roots (by 10%) and branching of the root system is observed, which is presumably due to the availability of the fertilizer components. The effect fertilizer on the photosynthetic apparatus, carbon dioxide assimilation and transpiration rate when use in a range of concentrations is studied. On average, the transpiration activity increased by 2 times in the variant with the working concentration and by 1.8 times in the variant with one fifth of the working concentration. A slight increase in the efficiency of non-photochemical fluorescence quenching is revealed in plants at the &#8220;AktiMax&#8221; application. The efficiency of seed priming method use to stimulate the rate of winter wheat development is demonstrated that leads to reduction of unfavorable outcomes risks.</description>

                Process simulation was integrated with life cycle assessment to evaluate process efficiency and environmental impact of the production of manganese ferroalloys for various production modes and different ore mineralogies. Utilizing HSC Sim, the model was designed to evaluate the production process with or without a pretreatment step, where results for simulated cases using a four-zone ferromanganese furnace model were exported to openLCA for a complete life cycle assessment. Two main production scenarios were simulated: a closed ferromanganese furnace running on the duplex method and an open furnace running on the discard slag approach. The closed furnace scenario achieved a 17.5% reduction in energy consumption and a 16.2% decrease in direct CO2 emissions with CO-rich off-gas pretreatment. The open furnace scenario showed an 11.2% reduction in energy consumption with thermal solar energy pretreatment but no change in CO2 emissions.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Visible Light for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Conversion: The Role of Highly Reduced Phosphomolybdate Crystals as Powerful Photocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.4c03810</link>

                Heterogeneous photocatalysts, characterized by well-defined atomic structures and the capacity for rapid, directional electron transfer, are pivotal in the exploration and development of highly efficient systems for visible-light-driven diluted CO2 reduction. Herein, we constructed highly reduced phosphomolybdates crystalline materials 1&#8211;3 to help this process, with the formula of [Co2(C8N3H7)4][Co2(C8N3H7)4(H2O)2][Co(H7P4Mo6O31)2]&#183;8H2O (1), [Ni2(C8N3H7)4(H2O)2][Ni2(C8N3H7)4][Ni(H2O)4][Ni(H6P4Mo6O31)2]&#183;3H2O&#183;2C2H5OH (2), and [Zn2(C8N3H7)2][Zn2(C8N3H7)4][Zn2(C8N3H7)2(H2O)2][Zn(H5P4Mo6O31)2] (3) [C8N3H7 = 2-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)pyridine]. Specifically, catalyst 1 demonstrated a CO production rate of 3276.4 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 in an environment with 20% CO2 concentration, and an impressively elevated rate of 10740.3 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 in a pure CO2 atmosphere. Steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy revealed that the directional migration of photoelectrons from the Ru complexes to the catalyst was instrumental in enhancing the catalytic activity. This study provides valuable insights into the rational operation of low-concentration CO2 conversion treatment and the design and synthesis of photocatalysts.</description>

                Introduction Global food security is challenged by the increasing levels of air pollutants like ozone (O 3 ) through their impacts on crop productivity. The present study was conducted to quantify the interactive effect of elevated ozone (O 3 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), on different rice varieties in northern India. Methods An experiment was conducted in Genetic H field, Environment science, IARI for two consecutive years (2020 and 2021) during the kharif season, to quantify the impact of elevated O 3 and CO 2 interaction on productivity, and plant N in three rice varieties (Pusa basmati 1121, Nagina 22, IR64 Drt1) under different nitrogen (N) management practices. Rice crop was grown in Free Air Ozone-Carbon dioxide Enrichment rings (FAOCE) rings with two levels of O 3 (elevated 60 &#177;10ppb and ambient) and two levels of CO 2 (elevated, 550&#177;25 ppm and ambient) concentration and their interaction with two N fertilizer treatments i.e., 100% RDN (recommended dose of N) and 125% RDN. Results and discussion Elevated O 3 significantly decreased physiological parameters like photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate of the crop. Grain yield reduced by 7.2-7.5%, in Pusa Basmati 1121 and from 6.9-9% in IR64 Drt1 varieties in elevated O 3 treatment as compared to ambient treatment. Yield reduction in Nagina 22 variety was not significant in elevated O 3 treatment. Elevated CO 2 concentration of 550 ppm was able to fully compensate the yield loss in Nagina 22 variety and partially compensate (3.9-8.0%) in Pusa Basmati 1121 and IR64 Drt1 varieties. Grain N concentration in rice varieties decreased by 10.8-14.7% during first year and by 7.8-20.6% during second year in elevated O 3 plus CO 2 interaction treatment than ambient. Grain N uptake also decreased (13.2-17.1% in first year and 4.5-22.8% in second year) in elevated O 3 plus CO 2 interaction treatment as compared to ambient. Application of additional 25% of recommended dose of N improved grain N concentration, grain N uptake as well as available N of soil as compared to 100% RDN treatment in elevated O 3 plus CO 2 interaction treatment. Additional 25% N dose could help in sustaining rice productivity and quality under elevated O 3 and CO 2 condition.</description>

      <title>Reducing the climate impact of food choices with comparable nutritional quality: a randomised trial</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckae144.1427</link>

                Abstract Background Diets largely contribute to the global disease burden, and a third of global warming emissions. We assessed the climate footprint reduction effect of framing the climate impact of diets as a collective action problem (social dilemma), compared or in combination with a reflective intervention (information) and a choice architecture intervention (nudge). Interactions with lifestyle factors were examined. Methods A randomised 2X2X2 between-subjects online experiment was conducted among university students &#8805;18 years, enrolled at a Swiss university, and not following a medically prescribed diet. The outcome was the mean climate footprint of food choices (in kg CO2-eq), based on a Life Cycle Assessment. Meals varied in climate footprints while adhering to the Swiss dietary guidelines. Results This analysis focused on the subset of meat eaters (n = 1691). Median age was 24 years, and 59.85% (n = 1012) were female. Seven intervention groups resulted in significantly lower climate footprints compared to the control. The social dilemma plus a nudge menu was the most effective behavioural intervention leading to 20.20% footprint reduction (b = -1.20 kg CO2-eq) compared to the control group (Mcontrol=5.94, SDcontrol=2.76; Mdilemma+nudge=4.74, SDdilemma+nudge=2.09 t(436) = -5.10, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Lifestyle factors linked to a higher climate footprint of food choices included adhering to a low-calorie diet (b = 1.21 kg CO2-eq, p &amp;lt; 0.05), or a muscle gain diet (b = 2.12 kg CO2-eq p &amp;lt; 0.05) and practising physical activities (PA) while adhering to a muscle-gain diet (Aerobic/Cardio: 3.82 kg CO2-eq, p &amp;lt; 0.05; Muscle-strengthening: 2.24 kg CO2-eq, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions The combination of reflective collective action communication and menu nudges is an effective strategy to mitigate the climate footprint of food choices in education institutions. Adherence to a muscle-gain diet was identified as a critical but manageable lifestyle factor linked to a higher climate footprint. Key messages &#8226; The dilemma plus a nudge was the most effective to reduce the climate footprint of food choices. &#8226; This combined intervention can manage the high climate footprints linked to lifestyle factors.</description>

                Ambient urea synthesis via C&#8211;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate reduction offers an attractive alternative to the Bosch-Meiser route, but it is hindered by the lack of efficient catalysts. Herein, we report that Fe-doped InOOH nanosheets effectively catalyze the coreduction of CO2 and nitrate, giving a high Faradaic Efficiency of 26.9%, a yield rate of 980.6 &#956;g h&#8211;1 mgcat.&#8211;1, and a good durability. Theoretical calculations further elucidate that iron dopants can tailor the reactivity of the In site, facilitating the hydrogenation of the key *CO2NH2 intermediate and suppressing the hydrogen production with a higher energy barrier.</description>

      <title>Hemoglobin value prediction with bayesian optimization assisted machine learning models</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.33769/aupse.1462331</link>
      <description>Koray A&#231;&#305;c&#305;, Communications Faculty of Sciences University of Ankara Series A2-A3 Physical Sciences and Engineering. 66(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403825000

                This study presents a framework for predicting hemoglobin (Hb) levels utilizing Bayesian optimization-assisted machine learning models, incorporating both time-domain and frequency-domain features derived from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. Hemoglobin, a crucial protein for oxygen and carbon dioxide transport in the blood, has levels that indicate various health conditions, including anemia and diseases affecting red blood cell production. Traditional methods for measuring Hb levels are invasive, posing potential risks and discomfort. To address this, a dataset comprising PPG signals, along with demographic data (gender and age), was analyzed to predict Hb levels accurately. Our models employ support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural networks (ANNs), classification and regression trees (CART), and ensembles of trees (EoT) optimized through Bayesian optimization algorithm. The results demonstrated that incorporating age and gender as features significantly improved model performance, highlighting their importance in Hb level prediction. Among the tested models, ANN provided the best results, involving normalized raw signals, feature selection, and reduction methods. The model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 1.508, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 1.228, and R-squared (R&#178;) of 0.226. This study's findings contribute to the growing body of research on non-invasive hemoglobin prediction, offering a potential tool for healthcare professionals and patients for convenient and risk-free Hb level monitoring.</description>

                Employing vehicle telematics data, this study investigates the transport environment across urban and major road networks during a two-week period encompassing the Easter holidays, considered as a case study. The analysis spans four distinct years: 2016, 2018, 2021, and 2022. Geospatial and Temporal Mapping captured the dependencies of vehicle speed, acceleration, vehicle-specific power (VSP), and emission factors (EFs) for air pollutants (CO2 and NOx) on the studied calendar period. The results showed that during the Easter holiday, the median vehicle speeds exceeded annual averages by roughly 5%, indicating a clear deviation from regular traffic patterns. This deviation was particularly stark during the 2021 lockdown, with a significant drop in vehicle presence, leading to less congestion and thus higher speeds and vehicle acceleration. The emissions analyses revealed that individual cars emit higher levels of CO2 and NOx during Easter. Specifically, the median values of CO2 EF and NOx EF were 9% and 11% higher than the annual norm. When combined with road occupancy data, the results demonstrate that the Easter holidays in 2022 had a variable impact on NOx and CO2 emissions, with significant reductions on major roads during weekday rush hours (15&#8211;25%) but slight increases on urban roads during weekend periods.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Urban Breathability: Investigating the Synergistic Mitigation of PM2.5 and CO2 by Community Park Green Space in the Built Environment Using Simulation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14113407</link>

                Reducing carbon emissions and controlling air pollution is a dual challenge for China in addressing climate change. Analyzing the synergistic relationship between PM2.5 and CO2 in urban green spaces has become an important part of promoting pollution control. The study investigated the influence and synergistic relationship between the spatial pattern of community parks on PM2.5 and CO2 in Xi&#8217;an City, Shaanxi Province, through practical measurement and ENVI-met/Open Studio simulation calculations. The results showed that: (1) Within the sphere of influence, community parks exhibit a positive synergy varying with distance, peaking at 400 m and declining as 300 m &gt; 500 m &gt; 200 m &gt; 100 m. (2) The green space rate, total edge (TE), and mean patch shape index (SHAPE_MN) positively influence the synergistic mitigation of PM2.5 and CO2, with a defined maximum impact boundary. The strongest synergistic reduction of PM2.5 and CO2 occurs at a green space rate of 85%, TE1200, and SHAPE1.2, with optimal influence boundaries of 300 m, 200 m, and 100 m, respectively. This conclusion demonstrates the key role of green space in community parks in the synergistic abatement and provides a scientific basis and practical guidance for the planning and design of urban green space under the goal of &#8220;dual-carbon&#8221;.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling and Indirect Carbon Emission Reduction Analysis of Urban Wastewater Treatment Systems Under Different Temperature Conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/w16213039</link>
      <description>Shiyue Liu, Shuang Liang, Zhiqiang Chen, Yongguang Ma, Weichun Gao, Xueyong Tian, Yuanqing Luo, Water. 16(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403680672

                In the context of achieving the two-carbon target, this study utilized a wastewater treatment plant in Shenyang City as a case study to accurately calculate indirect emissions related to energy and chemical consumption within the energy-intensive wastewater treatment industry. Sumo software was employed for precise mathematical modeling. Considering the operational characteristics of wastewater treatment plants in cold regions, this study innovatively divided the annual operation cycle into two periods, namely normal temperature and low temperature, and determined the optimal operational parameters under a low-carbon mode. The results indicate that precise regulation of dissolved oxygen concentration to 0.5&#8211;1.5 mg/L (normal temperature period) and 1&#8211;2 mg/L (low temperature period) can significantly reduce carbon emissions related to electricity consumption by 13,781.9 t CO2-eq. From the perspective of chemical consumption, adjusting the dosage of polyaluminum chloride (PAC) to 75% and sodium acetate to 70% during the normal temperature period can lead to a reduction in indirect carbon emissions of 1614.4 t CO2-eq compared to the same period last year. During the low-temperature period, by reducing the dosage of polyaluminum chloride to 80% and sodium acetate to 75%, the indirect carbon emissions can be reduced by 1557.3 t CO2-eq compared to the corresponding period last year. After optimization, USD 1.49 million can be saved. This study simulated the operation conditions of cold-region urban wastewater treatment plants at different times to effectively control carbon emissions resulting from energy and chemical consumption in wastewater treatment. This result can provide innovative ideas for energy saving and carbon reduction in cold-region wastewater treatment plants.</description>

      <title>Neutralization and CO2 fixation behavior of alkaline recycled soil using column tests with CO2 ventilation</title>

      <description>Su Myat Mon, Aya Sakaguchi, Kimitoshi Hayano, Hiromoto Yamauchi, Acta Geotechnica. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403827833

                Abstract Column tests were conducted to elucidate the pH neutralization and CO 2 fixation behavior of alkaline recycled soils permeated with CO 2 . The ventilation period required for complete CO 2 fixation ( t EOF ) was estimated from the test results of each column. The maximum amount of CO 2 captured per gram of dry soil (( m CO2 ) max ) was determined based on the inflow and outflow of CO 2 for each specimen. The investigation into the effects of soil density, specimen height, CO 2 gas concentration, and flow rate on t EOF and ( m CO2 ) max revealed that t EOF increased with higher dry density ( &#961; d ) or specimen height ( H ), as a denser and larger specimen consumed more CO 2 gas. Conversely, t EOF decreased with a higher CO 2 gas concentration ( C ) or flow volume ( Q ) because a low C or Q resulted in an insufficient CO 2 gas supply to match the consumption induced by the reaction. Lower C and Q tended to yield higher ( m CO2 ) max , whereas higher &#961; d and H resulted in higher ( m CO2 ) max . Furthermore, ( m CO2 ) max increased with t EOF , with a slight reduction in pH after neutralization with increased t EOF . This phenomenon was attributed to the longer ventilation period enabling more Ca to react with the CO 2 gas and maintain the equilibrium state of the reaction. Finally, the evaluation of the CO 2 consumption rate ( CSR ) for each column specimen revealed that a higher C and Q resulted in a lower CSR , whereas a higher H resulted in a higher CSR . Additionally, a longer t EOF was associated with a higher CSR , although some variation was observed.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Operational Efficiency and Energy Saving Through the Implementation of Long Stroke Units in Field A: Mitigating High Failure Rates for Sustainable Deployment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/221550-ms</link>

                Abstract Field A, the largest cluster in Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), faced a significant challenge with a high overall artificial lift failure index, surpassing industry standards at 28% in 2020. The primary contributors to this index were beam pump (BP) wells. In response, a comprehensive workshop was conducted involving all stakeholders to address the issue of artificial lift failures. Field A's artificial lift fail-less strategy was formulated and implemented as a result of this workshop. A long stroke unit (LSU) was deployed in Field A as a result of the persistently high failure rates for conventional beam pump units (BP), which exceeded 32% in 2020. In an effort to mitigate these challenges, a series of successful trials were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of LSU, which led to the conversion of 70 conventional BP units to LSUs between 2020 and 2023. The results obtained from the deployment of LSU in Field A showcased significantly improved run life, indicated by a reduction in failure index. This increase in reliability contributed to the avoidance of subsurface deferments due to less failures and tripping, resulting in estimated additional production of 320 bbl/d. Additionally, LSUs reduced the number of well interventions, primarily due to fewer failures. It resulted in a substantial improvement in the life cycle of the wells, saving $2.94 million annually. As a result of the deployment of LSUs, power savings were also achieved. In comparison to conventional BP units, LSU demonstrated a remarkable 40% reduction in power consumption, resulting in a significant decrease in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 4575 tCO2e since LSUs deployment. This successful implementation not only addressed high failure rates but also enhanced system reliability, reduced corrective maintenance, lowered power consumption, and effectively reduced oil deferment. This abstract outlines these positive outcomes, the challenges faced during implementation, and strategies used to overcome them. Additionally, it presents a roadmap for deploying LSUs across Field &#8216;A, with plans for over 150 LSUs installation in the next five years. The study provides valuable insights for the oil and gas industry, showcasing the potential for wide adoption of LSUs to enhance performance in similar fields.</description>

      <title>On the Significance of Hydrate Formation/Dissociation during CO2 Injection in Depleted Gas Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/218550-pa</link>
      <description>V. Indina, Bruno Ramon Batista Fernandes, Mojdeh Delshad, R. Farajzadeh, Kamy Sepehrnoori, SPE Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403682888

                Summary The study aims to quantitatively assess the risk of hydrate formation within the porous formation and its consequences on injectivity during storage of CO2 in depleted gas reservoirs considering low temperatures caused by the Joule-Thomson (JT) effect and hydrate kinetics. Hydrates formed during CO2 storage operation can occupy porous spaces in the reservoir rock, reducing the rock&#8217;s permeability and thus becoming a hindrance to the storage project. The aim was to understand which mechanisms can mitigate or prevent the formation of hydrates. The key mechanisms we studied included water dry-out, heat exchange with surrounding rock formation, and capillary pressure. A semicompositional thermal reservoir simulator is used to model the fluid and heat flow of CO2 through a reservoir initially composed of brine and methane. The simulator can model the formation and dissociation of both methane and CO2 hydrates using kinetic reactions. This approach has the advantage of computing the amount of hydrate deposited and estimating its effects on the porosity and permeability alteration. Sensitivity analyses are also carried out to investigate the impact of different parameters and mechanisms on the deposition of hydrates and the injectivity of CO2. Simulation results for a simplified model were verified with results from the literature. The key results of this work are as follows: (1) The JT effect strongly depends on the reservoir permeability and initial pressure and could lead to the formation of hydrates within the porous media even when the injected CO2 temperature was higher than the hydrate equilibrium temperature; (2) the heat gain from underburden and overburden rock formations could prevent hydrates formed at late time; (3) permeability reduction increased the formation of hydrates due to an increased JT cooling; and (4) water dry-out near the wellbore did not prevent hydrate formation. Finally, the role of capillary pressure was quite complex, as it reduced the formation of hydrates in certain cases and increased in other cases. Simulating this process with heat flow and hydrate reactions was also shown to present severe numerical issues. It was critical to select convergence criteria and linear system tolerances to avoid large material balance and numerical errors.</description>

                Objectives:The construction sector is a very important sector in achieving carbon neutrality. In modern society, construction has grown rapidly, and basic materials such as cement and concrete have contributed greatly to the development of construction. These materials emit a large amount of global warming substances during the raw material extraction and production process, causing serious environmental pollution. In order to establish a carbon reduction strategy to slow down global warming, we compared the environmental impacts of each building material and showed the current situation.Methods:The LCI DB for the construction materials used in the two-story wooden house (Building area 128.67m2, total floor area 235.73m2) located in the National Institute of Forest Science was extracted. Then, the data for LCA was processed and performed through the life cycle assessment methodology for the resources consumed from raw material collection, material production, and transportation stages. Then, based on the environmental performance labeling impact assessment method, a study was conducted on the environmental impact categories of the actual construction materials used and comparisons with other construction materials.Results and Discussion:When analyzing the environmental impact of concrete [25-21-120] and construction wood used in wooden house, the environmental impact was found to be 98.79% higher on average in the pre-manufacturing stage than in the manufacturing stage, and construction wood was confirmed to have a reduction effect of 62.21 kg CO2-eq per 1 m3 compared to concrete. Through the scenario, there was a carbon reduction effect of up to 36% when the entire area was replaced with wood. In addition, the environmental impact by major construction material was quantitatively quantified.Conclusion:When building a wooden house, reducing the amount of concrete equivalent to the amount of wood is expected to have a greenhouse gas reduction effect, so it is time to activate construction wood from the production process to the post-production stage to replace concrete. In addition, follow-up research on the development of construction technology with low environmental impact during construction should be continued. This study is expected to be used as a useful indicator for R&amp;D and policies in the construction field in the future, as it quantitatively quantified the amount of CO2 reduction per m3 when replacing concrete with construction wood and numerically compared and analyzed six major environmental impact categories by major construction materials.</description>

      <title>Effects of drought on photosynthetic induction in leaves of different wheat genotypes under dark-to-light transition</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.15421/022471</link>
      <description>A.S. Kedruk, D.A. Kiriziy, &#1054;.&#1054;. &#1057;&#1090;&#1072;&#1089;&#1080;&#1082;, &#1054;. G. Sokolovska-Sergiienko, M.V. Tarasiuk, Regulatory Mechanisms in Biosystems. 15(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403770686

                Adjustment of photosynthetic processes to an increase in irradiance constrains the CO2 assimilation and photosynthetic carbon gain compared to that which would be obtained if photosynthesis reached its terminal value instantaneously. Acceleration of photosynthesis induction under field conditions of fluctuating light opens up new perspectives for increasing yields. However, there is little information on response of photosynthetic processes to changes in the light under drought conditions. In a pot experiment, we have studied the peculiarities of response of CO2- and H2O-gas exchange parameters in flag leaves of 3 winter wheat genotypes to a transition from dark to bright light under drought conditions, to reveal the features of drought effect on photosynthetic induction processes. The plants were exposed to a 7-day drought (30% FC) during the flowering stage. After that, the watering of the treated plants was restored to the control level (70% FC), which was maintained until the end of the growing season. Induction curves of CO2 assimilation and transpiration of the flag leaves were recorded after keeping them in the darkness for 30 minutes, then the light was turned on. It was revealed that drought impacts the photosynthetic apparatus by reducing its maximum functional intensity as well as by diminishing its ability to respond to changing light conditions. Specifically, drought slows the rate of gas exchange increase during transitions from dark to light. High-yielding wheat genotypes, which had higher assimilation rates and stomatal conductance under optimal watering, showed increased sensitivity to drought. The reduction in the CO2 assimilation rate in wheat leaves under drought was primarily due to damage to the photosynthetic apparatus in mesophyll cells, rather than inhibition of stomatal conductance. This conclusion is supported by Ci value calculations, which were highest at the lowest CO2 assimilation rate at the beginning of light exposure and lowest at the highest CO2 assimilation rate when reaching a steady-state plateau. The stronger impact of the drought on the biochemical components of the photosynthetic apparatus than on stomata is also suggested by a decrease in instantaneous water use efficiency (WUEi) during photosynthesis. The genotypic differences in the effects of drought on the dynamics of photosynthetic induction parameters during dark-to-light transitions in wheat leaves suggest the potential of these traits for evaluating breeding material. This could enhance the ecological plasticity of new wheat varieties.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Artificial Neural Network Ensembles for Ship Design Optimization to Reduce Added Wave Resistance and CO2 Emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17215326</link>
      <description>Tomasz Cepowski, Energies. 17(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403836845

                Increased maritime cargo transportation has necessitated stricter management of emissions from ships. The primary source of this pollution is fuel combustion, which is influenced by factors such as a ship&#8217;s added wave resistance. Accurate estimation of this resistance during ship design is crucial for minimizing exhaust emissions. The challenge is that, at the preliminary parametric design stage, only limited geometric data about the ship is available, and the existing methods for estimating added wave resistance cannot be applied. This article presents the application of artificial neural network (ANN) ensembles for estimating added wave resistance based on dimensionless design parameters available at the preliminary design stage, such as the length-to-breadth ratio (L/B), breadth-to-draught ratio (B/T), length-to-draught ratio (L/T), block coefficient (CB), and the Froude number (Fn). Four different ANN ensembles are developed to predict this resistance using both complete sets of design characteristics (i.e., L/B, B/T, CB, and Fn) and incomplete sets, such as L/B, CB, and Fn; B/T, CB, and Fn; and L/T, CB, and Fn. This approach allows for the consideration of CO2 emissions at the parametric design stage when only limited ship dimensions are known. An example in this article demonstrates that minor modifications to typical container ship designs can significantly reduce added wave resistance, resulting in a daily reduction of up to 2.55 tons of CO2 emissions. This reduction is equivalent to the emissions produced by 778 cars per day, highlighting the environmental benefits of optimizing ship design.</description>

      <description>Shubh Pravat Singh Yadav, Netra Prasad Ghimire, Prava Paudel, Dipesh Kumar Mehata, Sangita Bhujel, Journal of Sustainable Agriculture and Environment. 3(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403694588

                Abstract The implications of global warming present significant threats to both crop productivity and environmental sustainability. The global population greatly depends on rice as a staple food, contributing significantly to global warming and agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Agricultural soils play a crucial role in the release and uptake of essential GHGs, including methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), serving as both sources and sinks within the agricultural ecosystem. Notably, rice fields alone account for approximately 30% and 11% of global CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from agricultural activities, respectively. As the demand for rice is expected to rise in the future, it becomes increasingly critical to address GHG emissions and minimise the detrimental environmental effects associated with rice production. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the available data regarding the influence of different crop management practices on GHG emissions in rice fields. We recognise the substantial potential for reducing GHG emissions through modifications in traditional crop management systems. Our analysis evaluates various options, such as adjustments in cropping practices, regulation of organic and fertiliser inputs, management of tillage techniques and irrigation strategies, and the selection of suitable cultivars, all of which can contribute to GHG emission reduction. It is crucial to consider that changes in management practices may have simultaneous and sometimes contradictory effects on different gases through various mechanisms. Therefore, our comprehensive evaluation aims to assess the potential global warming impact of each approach, considering the magnitude of their effects on all gases. This assessment seeks to identify suitable crop management practices that effectively reduce GHG emissions in rice cultivation while considering the overall environmental impact.</description>

      <title>The effect of firewood combustion cookstove types on indoor air pollution and deforestation in selected rural houses of Ethiopia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1326517</link>

                Introduction Indoor air pollution occurs in a microenvironment such as residential homes, closed working places, or industries in which people spend a large part of their time. Cooking or baking food in traditional or open three-stone cookstoves by using firewood is the cause for kitchen-related smoke indoor air pollution and deforestation. Modifying traditional firewood cookstoves could reduce the emissions of indoor air pollutants. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of firewood cookstove types on indoor air pollution, emission reduction, and deforestation in selected rural houses of Bure, Ameya, and Dalocha woredas (districts) of Ethiopia. Methods Indoor air pollutants such as carbonmonoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), sulfurdioxide (SO 2 ), and particulate matters (PMs) were measured in three replicates for 3 min. within an average cooking time of 1 h using an automatic gas sensor. The amount of wood was separately measured by using graduated weight balance (0.1 gm). Results and discussion The cooking place was mostly the same room as the sleeping place without a separate kitchen. The improved cookstoves were installed without a chimney (smokeoutlet) and with wider spaces left for a firewood inlet. In improved Injera baking cookstoves, the mean emission of CO was 1004.80 mg/m 3 , 33.00 mg/m 3 , and 53.85 mg/m 3 in Bure, Ameya, and Dalocha woredas, respectively, which were lower than the emissions from open cookstoves. The mean concentration of PM2.5 in open cookstoves in Bure, Ameya, and Dalocha woredaswas 124.50 mg/m 3 , 0.53 mg/m 3 , and 0.04 mg/m 3 , respectively, which are higher than the emission from improved stoves. In Bure woreda households, the CO exposure was above 26 times the permissible limit of WHO standards. Biomass consumption was positively correlated with the moisture content of wood ( p &amp;lt; 0.05). Improved cookstoves reduced indoor air pollution by 13%&#8211;81% and carbon emission and deforestation by 20%&#8211;41% when compared with the open three-stone cookstoves. Indoor air pollutants are risks to health and cause climate change problems. Therefore, awareness should be created on the health effects of firewood smoke indoor air pollution, ventilation of cooking places, and installation of chimneys with improved cookstoves.</description>

      <title>Low latency carbon budget analysis reveals a large decline of the land carbon sink in 2023</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwae367</link>
      <description>Piyu Ke, Philippe Ciais, Stephen Sitch, Wei Li, Ana Bastos, Zhu Liu, Yidi Xu, Xiaofan Gui, Jiang Bian, Daniel Goll, Yi Xi, Wanjing Li, Michael O&#8217;Sullivan, Jeffeson Goncalves de Souza, Pierre Friedlingstein, Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Chevallier, National Science Review. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403702208

                Abstract In 2023, the CO2 growth rate was 3.37 &#177; 0.11 ppm at Mauna Loa, 86% above the previous year, and hitting a record high since observations began in 1958, while global fossil fuel CO2 emissions only increased by 0.6 &#177; 0.5%. This implies an unprecedented weakening of land and ocean sinks, and raises the question of where and why this reduction happened. Here we show a global net land CO2 sink of 0.44 &#177; 0.21 GtC yr&#8722;1, the weakest since 2003. We used dynamic global vegetation models, satellites fire emissions, an atmospheric inversion based on OCO-2 measurements, and emulators of ocean biogeochemical and data driven models to deliver a fast-track carbon budget in 2023. Those models ensured consistency with previous carbon budgets. Regional flux anomalies from 2015&#8211;2022 are consistent between top-down and bottom-up approaches, with the largest abnormal carbon loss in the Amazon during the drought in the second half of 2023 (0.31 &#177; 0.19 GtC yr&#8722;1), extreme fire emissions of 0.58 &#177; 0.10 GtC yr&#8722;1 in Canada and a loss in South-East Asia (0.13 &#177; 0.12 GtC yr&#8722;1). Since 2015, land CO2 uptake north of 20&#176;N declined by half to 1.13 &#177; 0.24 GtC yr&#8722;1 in 2023. Meanwhile, the tropics recovered from the 2015&#8211;16 El Ni&#241;o carbon loss, gained carbon during the La Ni&#241;a years (2020&#8211;2023), then switched to a carbon loss during the 2023 El Ni&#241;o (0.56 &#177; 0.23 GtC yr&#8722;1). The ocean sink was stronger than normal in the equatorial eastern Pacific due to reduced upwelling from La Ni&#241;a's retreat in early 2023 and the development of El Ni&#241;o later. Land regions exposed to extreme heat in 2023 contributed a gross carbon loss of 1.73 GtC yr&#8722;1, indicating that record warming in 2023 had a strong negative impact on the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to mitigate climate change.</description>

      <title>Modelling the integration of bagasse pyrolysis into sugar mill energy systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.36961/si32448</link>
      <description>Yu Matsueda, Madoc Sheehan, Jonathon Gilberd, Deleted Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403733031

                Pyrolysis degrades biomass under low oxygen conditions to produce an energy-rich gas, bio-oil, and carbon-dense biochar. The resulting bio-oil and gas can be combusted for high energy production, while biochar is a high-value product with potential as a fertiliser and soil amendment product. However, very few studies have been on integrating pyrolysis into the sugar mill energy system. This study aimed to model the integration of bagasse pyrolysis into an energy system based on Victoria Mill. The model was well-validated from previous literature on bagasse pyrolysis and mill system data. The pyrolysis unit&#8217;s operating conditions were optimised for steam production, carbon emission reduction, and product value, resulting in 20% less steam production, 16% reduced CO2 emissions, and 76% higher economic profit than current operations. Full steam production could be maintained by bypassing 30% of the bagasse to the pyrolysis unit and 70% directly to the boiler. This configuration led to 12% reduced CO2 emissions and 32% greater economic profits when compared to the current process. Overall, this research showed that the integration of bagasse pyrolysis into sugar mill energy systems has potentially substantial benefits, and its adoption in sugar milling deserves careful analysis.</description>

      <title>Energy Consumption, Emission, Transportation Sector in Malaysia: Review on Malaysia&#8217;s Road Transport</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.22610/imbr.v16i3s(i)a.4130</link>
      <description>Fatin Farazh Yaacob, Basri Badyalina, Sazlin Suhalmie Mohd Shariff, Mohamad Faizal Ramli, Rabiatul Munirah Alpandi, Information Management and Business Review. 16(3S(I)a)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403827357

                Transportation is a major challenge for energy conservation, with road transport in Malaysia being a significant contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In Malaysia, traditional fossil fuels such as gasoline and diesel dominate the transportation sector, which has become the second-largest source of GHG emissions, accounting for 20% in 2014. This increase in CO2 emissions, driven by rising vehicle ownership and economic growth, underscores the urgent need for effective emission reduction strategies. The rapid growth in road transportation in Malaysia is linked to socioeconomic factors, including rising incomes and urbanization, leading to higher energy consumption and pollution. Data indicates a significant increase in vehicle registrations from 1990 to 2018, with motorcars and motorcycles being the most common. This growth, fueled by subsidies and decentralization, has exacerbated the sector&#8217;s environmental impact. The Green Technology Master Plan Malaysia 2017&#8211;2040 aims to address these issues by setting ambitious targets to enhance renewable energy, improve energy efficiency, and promote eco-friendly fuels. Key strategies include expanding public transportation, increasing the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), and introducing alternative fuels like hydrogen. Malaysia has substantial potential to reduce CO2 emissions through initiatives such as expanding EV infrastructure, promoting natural gas vehicles, and improving public transit. Effective implementation of these strategies can significantly lower the transportation sector&#8217;s carbon footprint, contributing to a more sustainable future.</description>

      <title>Performance and Emission Characteristics of a Diesel Engine Fueled by Biodiesel-Ethanol-Diesel Fuel Blends</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.51141/ijatr.v4i1.27</link>
      <description>Hazir Farouk, International Journal of Advanced Thermofluid Research. 4(1)] 2018. https://openalex.org/W4403799577

                There is growing interest to study the effect of blending various oxygenated additives with diesel or biodiesel fuel on engine performance and emission characteristics. This study aims to analyze the performance and exhaust emission of a four-stroke, four-cylinder diesel engine fueled with biodiesel-ethanol-diesel. Biodiesel was first produced from crude Jatropha oil, and then it was blended with ethanol and fossil diesel in different blend ratios (B10E10D80, B12.5E12.5D75, B15E15D70, B20E20D60 and B25E25D50). The engine performance and emission characteristics were studied at engine speeds ranging from 1200 to 2000 rpm. The results show that the brake specific fuel consumption increases while the brake power decreases as the percentage of biodiesel and ethanol increases in the blend. The exhaust emission analysis shows a reduction in CO2 emission and increase in NOx emission when the biodiesel -to-ethanol ratio increases in the blends, when compared with diesel as a reference fuel.</description>

                The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruptions to workplace safety and productivity. A browser-based interactive disease transmission simulation was developed to enable managers and individuals (agents) to optimize safe office work activities during pandemic conditions. The application provides a user interface to evaluate the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) policies on airborne disease exposure based on agents&#8217; meeting patterns and room properties. Exposure is empirically calibrated using CO2 as a proxy for viral aerosol dispersion. For the building studied, the major findings are that the cubicles during low occupancy produce unexpectedly high exposure, upgrading meetings to larger rooms reduces total average exposure by 44%, and when all meetings are conducted in large rooms, a 79% exposure reduction is realized.</description>

      <title>Research and Case Application of Zero-Carbon Buildings Based on Multi-System Integration Function</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14113394</link>
      <description>Jiaji Zhang, Yu-Ting Lin, Li Wang, Qiankun Wang, Ke Zhu, Shize Yang, Guoqing Guo, Buildings. 14(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403761728

                This study focuses on developing and implementing zero-carbon buildings through the integration of multiple systems to meet China&#8217;s carbon neutrality goals. It emphasizes the significant role of the building sector in carbon emissions and highlights the challenge of increasing energy consumption conflicting with China&#8217;s &#8220;dual carbon&#8221; targets. To address this, the research proposes a comprehensive framework that combines multifunctional envelope structure (MES) systems, photovoltaic power generation, energy storage, direct current (DC) systems, flexible energy management (PEDF), and regional energy stations. This framework integrates different technologies such as phase change materials, radiation cooling, and carbon mineralized cement, aiming to reduce carbon emissions throughout the building&#8217;s lifecycle. The method has been successfully applied in the Yazhou Bay Zero Carbon Post Station project in Sanya, Hainan, with precise calculations of carbon emission reductions. The carbon emission calculations revealed a reduction of 44.13 tons of CO2 annually, totaling 1103.31 tons over 25 years, primarily due to the rooftop photovoltaic systems. It demonstrates that the multi-system integration can reduce carbon emissions and contribute to China&#8217;s broader carbon neutrality goals. This approach, if widely adopted, could accelerate the transition to carbon-neutral buildings in China.</description>

                In this chapter, we will first review the elementary reactions involved in organic ligand transformations at transition metal complexes, which include oxidative addition, reductive elimination, insertion, elimination, nucleophilic and electrophilic reactions on the organic ligand, alkene and alkyne metathesis, and &#963;-bond metathesis. These are the reactions that characterise the chemistry of organometallic complexes, and this is the reason why organometallic complexes are used as catalysts for a variety of synthetic organic reactions. We will next discuss some typical examples of catalytic organic transformations and their catalytic mechanisms performed by transition metal complexes, such as hydrogenation, hydrosilylation, cross-coupling, and industrial reactions including hydroformylation, the Monsanto/Cativa process, and alkene polymerization. Furthermore, catalytic reactions related to energy conversion have been attracting increasing attention in recent years. To shed light on this topic, electrochemical catalytic generation of oxygen and hydrogen, photoreduction of CO2, and catalytic nitrogen fixation will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic Comparative Assessment of High Temperature Heat Pump Architectures for Industrial Pumped Thermal Energy Storage</title>

      <description>Silvia Trevisan, Bjarke Buchbjerg, A. Hoeg, Rafael Gu&#233;dez, Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403682201

                Abstract The industrial sector is a key global source of wealth, but it is also recognized as a major challenge toward worldwide decarbonization. Today the industrial sector requires more than 22 % of the global energy demand as thermal energy and produces for this about 40 % of the total CO2 emissions. Solutions to efficiently decarbonize the industrial sector are deemed. This work presents a comparative techno-economic performance assessment of a high temperature heat pump integration within a molten salts based power to heat system for industrial heat flexible generation. The main system performance is reported in terms of required working conditions and temperature for the heat pump and thermal demand size as well as reduction of the attainable levelized cost of heat (LCoH) against non-flexible electric boiler based systems. The impact of different industrial load profiles, electricity prices, heat pump capital cost and heat pump real to Carnot efficiency ratio are also presented. The results highlight that the proposed system can be cost-competitive, particularly for thermal demand around 10 MW and waste heat temperatures above 80&#176;C. Under these conditions LCoH reductions higher than 15 %, with respect to the considered non-flexible electric boiler alternative, are attainable. These LCoH reductions are primarily driven by savings in electrical consumption as high as 30 %. This study sets the ground for further power-to-heat techno-economic investigations addressing different industrial sectors and identifies main system and components design strategies, integrations, and targets.</description>

      <title>Persistent deep-water formation in the Nordic Seas during Marine Isotope Stages 5 and 4 notwithstanding changes in Atlantic overturning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-3163</link>

                Abstract. Reductions in the extent and formation of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and the expansion of southern-sourced waters in the Atlantic Ocean were linked to enhanced marine carbon storage during glacial and stadial periods and are considered a key mechanism explaining late Pleistocene atmospheric CO2 variations on glacial-interglacial and millennial timescales. However, changes in the formation of deep waters in the Nordic Seas, an important source of NADW, and their influence on the geometry and intensity of Atlantic overturning remain poorly understood, especially beyond the last glacial maximum, leaving possible impacts on atmospheric CO2 changes elusive. Here, we present high-resolution Cibicidoides wuellerstorfi B/Ca-based bottom water [CO32-] reconstructions, alongside with complementary C. wuellerstorfi stable oxygen and carbon isotopes and abundance estimates of aragonitic pteropods in marine sediment core PS1243 from the deep Norwegian Sea to investigate past deep-water dynamics in the Nordic Seas and potential impacts on Atlantic overturning and carbon cycling. Our data suggest continuous formation of dense and well-ventilated (high-[CO32-]) deep waters throughout Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) 5 and 4, alongside a deepening of the aragonite compensation depth by at least 700 m during the MIS 5b-to-4 transition, consistent with sustained Nordic Seas convection. In addition, higher-than-Holocene bottom water [CO32-] during MIS 5e highlight the resilience of Nordic Seas overturning towards a warmer North Atlantic, decreased Arctic sea ice extent and meltwater supply from surrounding ice sheets. A compilation of bottom water [CO32-] records from the Atlantic Ocean indicates that dense waters from the Nordic Seas may have continuously expanded into the intermediate and/or deep (western) North Atlantic via supply of dense water overflows across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge, diminishing the capacity of the North Atlantic to store carbon during MIS 4 and stadial conditions of MIS 5. Our study emphasises differences in the sensitivity of North Atlantic and Nordic Seas overturning dynamics to climate boundary conditions of the last glacial cycle that have implications for the carbon storage capacity of the Atlantic Ocean and its role in atmospheric CO2 variations.</description>

                Multimetallic nanoalloy catalysts have attracted considerable interest for enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of many electrochemically driven chemical processes. However, the preparation of homogeneous bimetallic alloy nanoparticles remains a challenge. Here, we present a room-temperature and scalable, host&#8211;guest approach for synthesis of dilute Cu in Ag alloy nanoparticles. In this approach, an ionic silver bromide precursor harboring exogenous Cu cations is reduced to yield &#8764;20 nm diameter AgCu alloy nanoparticles wherein the % Cu loading can be tuned precisely. AgCu nanoparticles with a 5% nominal loading of Cu exhibit peak activity (&#8722;0.23 mA/cm2 normalized partial current density) and selectivity (83.2% faradaic efficiency) for CO product formation from electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 at mild overpotentials. These AgCu nanoalloys exhibit a higher mass activity compared to Ag- and Cu-containing nanomaterials used for similar electrocatalytic transformations.

      <title>A Microgrid Deployment Framework to Support Drayage Electrification</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2410.01684</link>

                The electrification of heavy-duty commercial vehicles (HDCVs) is pivotal in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution; however, this transition poses significant challenges for the existing electric grid, which is not designed to meet the high electricity demands of HDCVs. This can lead to a less effective reduction in freight transportation's carbon intensity despite significant electrification efforts. Deploying renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaics, alongside energy storage solutions, is essential to address these challenges. This paper examines the current grid limitations and explores the critical role of microgrid deployment, integrating solar and battery energy storage systems, in supporting the electrification of HDCVs. We propose an integrated framework that is designed to enhance regional grid capacity and decrease carbon intensity by identifying viable sites where a microgrid can be deployed and provide estimates for the deployment cost. Furthermore, using this framework, we quantify the maximal impact of microgrid deployment in reducing CO2 emissions when we optimize the use of the available power. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to the region of the Port of Savannah, GA USA.</description>

      <title>Vietnam&#8217;s energy-related carbon emissions projections for the shared socioeconomic pathways towards net zero emission: a system dynamic analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54337/ijsepm.8327</link>
      <description>Ho&#224;ng H&#224; &#194;nh, Tr&#7847;n Minh D&#7841; H&#7841;nh, International Journal of Sustainable Energy Planning and Management. 42(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403733900

                Vietnam, a rapidly growing economy with high energy demand, aims for net-zero emissions by 2050. This study employs a system dynamic model to analyze the complex dynamics of energy-related carbon emissions. Historical data from 1990 to 2020 and predictions up to 2050 under five shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios were used. Sensitivity analysis identifies GDP.PPP growth rate, energy intensity, and energy structure as key drivers of energy consumption and carbon emissions. Predictions show that energy consumption and emissions peak in SSP5, followed by SSP1, SSP2, SSP4, and SSP3. By 2050, Vietnam's energy consumption and carbon emissions are expected to peak at 16,536,323 TJ and 1001 Mt CO2, respectively. While all scenarios meet the 2030 emission targets, they fail to meet the 2050 targets, with SSP5 requiring the most significant emission reductions. Without robust policy interventions, Vietnam may struggle to achieve its net-zero emission goal, emphasizing the need to promote energy-efficient sectors and transition to renewable energy sources.</description>

      <title>Innovative Approach in ESP Power Optimization for Large Field</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/221563-ms</link>
      <description>Mulad B. Winarno, M. A. Eissa, Mar&#237;a Flores, M. A. Khalifah, O. L. Isichei, Suleyman Malki, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403821887

                Abstract Electric Submersible Pump (ESP) is very popular artificial lift method to produce at high production rate. However, ESP power consumption is costly and mandate proper optimization to operate at the optimal condition. ESP energy optimization directly improve operational efficiency and reduces lifting cost and greenhouse gas emission. The ESP power optimization is challenging exercise and requires involvement from multiple organizations. The process has to go through excess of possible combinations of surface choke valve positions and pump speed until reaching an optimized setting. Optimization of ESP operations helps operators to meet production target while maximizing the efficiency of the pump operation. However, it cannot be achieved easily, especially where time and resources are scarce. An innovative approach capitalizing the digital-twin model and artificial intelligence technologies to optimize the ESP performance and adhering to the environmental challenges of reducing CO2 emission has been introduced to expedite the optimization process. The new approach automatically utilizes ESP real time data, ESP installation data along with the well model to determine the ESP's optimal WHP and ESP frequency. The modelling will be automatically updated based on real time data and provide predictions of recommended operation frequency and optimum wellhead pressure, which is translated to choke size, to operate the ESP at BEP (Best Efficiency Point) and to maximize production rate and minimize power consumption. The optimization process has been implemented in the field resulting in a significant power consumption saving and CO2 emission reduction. Further gains are also expected from ESP performance, resulting in longer ESP run life and reduce number of workover cost. This paper will share the ESP optimization journey using the advisory tool from obtaining the data, performing the calculations, providing the recommendations, and field implementation of these recommendations. The best practices and lessons learnt were captured as a reference for future ESP power optimization advisory tool enhancement.</description>

      <title>Health burden and costs attributed to the carbon footprint of health systems in the European Union</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckae144.021</link>
      <description>Jos&#233; Chen-Xu, M Corda, Orsolya Varga, Susana Viegas, European Journal of Public Health. 34(Supplement_3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403825534

                Abstract Background Health systems have an environmental impact of around 4.6% of global emissions, contributing to aggravating the climate crisis. However, the health impact of the carbon emissions originated by health systems is not regularly assessed. We aim to estimate the health burden and associated costs of the carbon footprint of health systems across the European Union (EU). Methods We calculated DALYs and associated costs based on human health damage factors (DALYs/kg-CO2e) by considering four scenarios. Three scenarios for shared socioeconomic pathways (S1 - high growth, S2 - baseline, and S3 - low growth) represented variations of global society, demographics, and economics until 2100. A fourth scenario (S4) considered the current EU&#8217;s 55% reduction goal of greenhouse gas emissions. The healthcare sector&#8217;s emissions per capita (in CO2-equivalent) in 2019 were extracted from the Lancet Countdown, and population data were retrieved from Eurostat for the same year. Results In the EU, 365,047 DALYs (95%CI: 194,692-535,403) are expected to be caused by health systems&#8217; emissions at baseline (S2). In an S1 scenario, the burden would slightly decrease to 315,374 DALYs (95%CI: 170,355-462,393), whereas a S3 scenario would increase 486,730 DALYs (95%CI: 243,365-681,422). If EU&#8217;s carbon goals are met, the burden could be substantially reduced to 164,271 DALYs (95%CI: 87,611-240,931). The monetisation of DALYs can result in costs amounting to 25.6 billion euros. Conclusions CO2 emissions from health systems are expected to significantly impact human health. It is therefore of the utmost importance to ensure that EU climate policies for healthcare buildings are in line with the Paris Agreement. This will require the implementation of climate mitigation programmes within the health sector and a review of clinical practices at the local level. Key messages &#8226; The carbon footprint of health systems is estimated to significantly impact health, with high economic burden. &#8226; EU climate policies for healthcare buildings and procurement must be aligned with the Paris Agreement.</description>

      <title>Preparation of nano Cu-Mo2C interface supported on ordered mesoporous biochar of ultrahigh surface area for reverse water gas shift reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s42773-024-00392-5</link>

                Abstract High conversion rate and selectivity are challenges for CO 2 utilization through catalytic reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Herein, a novel mesoporous biochar (MB) supported Cu-Mo 2 C nano-interface was prepared by consecutive physical activation of coconut shells followed by carbothermal hydrogen reduction of bimetal. As compared with traditional carbon materials, this MB exhibited ultra-high specific surface area (2693 m 2 g &#8211;1 ) and mesopore volume of mesopore (0.81 cm 3 g &#8211;1 ) with a narrow distribution (2&#8211;5 nm), responsible for the high dispersion of binary Cu-Mo 2 C sites, CO 2 adsorption and mass transfer in the reaction system. Moderate carbothermal reduction led to the sufficient reduction of Mo ion with carbon matrix of MB and dispersive growth of nano Cu-Mo 2 C binary sites (~ 6.1 nm) on the surface of MB. Cu + species were formed from Cu 0 via electron transfer and showed high dispersion with simultaneous boosted bimetal loading due to the strong interaction between nano Mo 2 C and Cu. These were advantageous to the intrinsic activity and stability of the Cu-Mo 2 C binary sites and their accessibility to the reactant molecules. Under the RWGS reaction conditions of 500 &#176;C, atmospheric pressure, and 300,000 ml/g/h gas hour space velocity, the CO 2 conversion rate over Cu-Mo 2 C/MB reached 27.74 &#215; 10 &#8211;5 mol CO2 /g cat /s at very low H 2 partial pressure, which was more than twice that over traditional carbon supported Cu-Mo 2 C catalysts. In addition, this catalyst exhibited 99.08% CO selectivity and high stability for more than 50 h without a decrease in activity and selectivity. This study offers a new development strategy and a promising candidate for industrial RWGS. Graphical Abstract</description>

                General concept is proposed for a technology of purifying waste gases of TPPs and metallurgical enterprises from SO2 and CO2 . The fundamental possibility of carrying out the process of regeneration of carbonate-sulfate melt with natural gas is shown. Based on experimental work it has been established that the process of regeneration of a carbonate-sulfate melt with natural gas provides high rates of sulfate reduction and the achievement of maximum up to 99% sulfur recovery from the melt in the form of H2 S. It has been determined that the removal of sulfur from a carbonate-sulfate melt by bubbling with natural gas can be carried out in the operating temperature range of an absorption column for purifying exhaust gases as 500-550 &#186;&#1057;. It is shown that the process of regeneration of a carbonate-sulfate melt with natural gas is a relatively simple one-stage process that proceeds at a high rate. This allows the regeneration column to be integrated with an absorption column where sulfur is captured from the exhaust gases. The removal of sulfur in the form of H2 S provides considerable range of choice in terms of the final commercial product: either sulfuric acid (by dry combustion of H2 S) or elemental sulfur (by the Claus process), both have significant commercial value. The proposed method for the regeneration of a carbonate-sulfate melt simplifies the technology of purifying waste gases from sulfur dioxide with a carbonate melt of alkali metals. Moreover, it can be easily integrated into the general technological scheme of existing metallurgical enterprises without special material and energy costs.</description>

      <title>Effect of Waste Glass Powder Replacement of Hydraulic Lime on Properties of Natural Hydraulic Lime Mortars</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17215247</link>
      <description>Murat &#350;ahin, P. &#214;zyigit, Materials. 17(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403835555

                This paper investigates the effects of the partial replacement of natural hydraulic lime (NHL) with waste glass powder (GP) on the physical, mechanical, and microstructural properties of NHL mortars. In the experimental study, five mixtures containing up to 50% GP were prepared to evaluate its effect on the flow, carbonation, unit weight, water absorption, porosity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, capillary water absorption, compressive strength, and microstructure of NHL mortars. The experimental results suggest that the partial replacement of NHL with GP significantly affects the properties of NHL mortars. A reduction in compressive strength was observed with increasing GP content in mortars at both early and later stages. Nevertheless, the compressive strength difference between samples containing 50% GP and the reference was found to be relatively minor at 91 days, implying an enhanced pozzolanic reaction over time. The incorporation of GP improved the consistency and capillary water absorption of mortars, while the opposite was observed for ultrasonic pulse velocity, porosity, and water absorption. The microstructural analysis revealed distinct changes in the structure of samples incorporating GP. The partial substitution of hydraulic lime with GP could be beneficial in reducing the CO2 emissions of NHL mortars.</description>

      <title>Computational fluid dynamics: Its carbon footprint and role in carbon reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0217320</link>
      <description>Xiang I. A. Yang, Wen Zhang, Mahdi Abkar, William Anderson, Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy. 16(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403685132

                Turbulent flow physics regulates the aerodynamic properties of lifting surfaces, the thermodynamic efficiency of vapor power systems, and exchanges of natural and anthropogenic quantities between the atmosphere and ocean, to name just a few applications of contemporary importance. The space-time dynamics of turbulent flows are described via numerical integration of the non-linear Navier&#8211;Stokes equation&#8212;a procedure known as computational fluid dynamics (CFD). At the dawn of scientific computing in the late 1950s, it would be many decades before terms such as &#8220;carbon footprint&#8221; or &#8220;sustainability&#8221; entered the lexicon, and longer still before these themes attained national priority throughout advanced economies. The environmental cost associated with CFD is seldom considered. Yet, large-scale scientific computing relies on intensive cooling realized via external power generation that is primarily accomplished through the combustion of fossil fuels, which leads to carbon emissions. This paper introduces a framework designed to calculate the carbon footprint of CFD and its contribution to carbon emission reduction strategies. We will distinguish between &#8220;hero&#8221; and &#8220;routine&#8221; calculations, noting that the carbon footprint of hero calculations&#8212;which demand significant computing resources at top-tier data centers&#8212;is largely determined by the energy source mix utilized. We will also review CFD of flows where turbulence effects are modeled, thus reducing the degrees of freedom. Estimates of the carbon footprint are presented for such fully and partially resolved simulations as functions of turbulence activity and calculation year, demonstrating a reduction in carbon emissions by two to five orders of magnitude at practical conditions. Besides generating a carbon footprint, the community's effort to avoid redundant calculations via turbulence databases merits particular attention, with estimates indicating that a single database could potentially reduce CO2 emissions by approximately O(1) &#215; 106 metric tons.</description>

      <title>Fuel tax loss in a world of electric mobility: A window of opportunity
  for congestion pricing</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2409.20033</link>
      <description>Thi Ngoc Nguyen, Felix Muesgens, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403814932

                The continued transition towards electric mobility will decrease energy tax revenues worldwide, which has substantial implications for government funds. At the same time, demand for transportation is ever increasing, which in turn increases congestion problems. Combining both challenges, this paper assesses the effectiveness of congestion pricing as a sustainable revenue stream to offset fuel tax loss in 2030 while simultaneously enhancing efficiency in the transport sector. A congestion-based toll that is road-and-time-variant is simulated for the greater Berlin area in Germany using the multi-agent transport simulation (MATSim) software. Through the simulation results, this paper quantifies the impacts of the toll on the governmental revenue, traffic management, environment, social welfare, and the distribution effects. We find that the revenue from congestion tolls in a metropolitan area can compensate the reduction in passenger car fuel tax. Furthermore, a remarkable welfare surplus is observed. The toll also successfully incentivises transport users to adjust their travel behaviour, which reduces traffic delay time by 28%. CO2 emissions as a key metric for decarbonisation of the transport sector decrease by more than 5%. The analysis of the distribution effects suggests that a redistribution plan with a focus on the middle-low-income residents and the outer boroughs could help the policy gain more public acceptance.</description>

      <title>Sustainability and Environmental Performance in Selective Collection of Residual Materials: Impact of Modulating Citizen Participation Through Policy and Incentive Implementation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/resources13110151</link>

                The effective management of urban waste represents a growing challenge in the face of demographic evolution and increased consumption. This study explores the impacts of municipal strategic decisions on household waste management behaviours and sustainability performance outcomes through agent-based modelling. Using data from Gatineau and Beaconsfield in Quebec, Canada, the model is calibrated and validated to represent diverse urban contexts. Our analysis demonstrates that reducing collection frequency leads to notable increases in participation rates, reaching 78.2 &#177; 5.1% for collections every two weeks and 96.5 &#177; 8.3% for collections every five weeks. While this reduction improves bin filling levels, it concurrently decreases the recovery of recyclable materials by 2.8% and 19.5%, significantly undermining the environmental benefits of the recycling program. These findings highlight a complex interplay between collection frequency, citizen participation behaviour, waste stream characteristics, and overall environmental performance. While reducing collection frequency initially appears beneficial, it leads to operational challenges and increased CO2 emissions due to reduced material recovery. The research emphasises the need for tailored holistic waste management strategies that optimise performance outcomes while minimising environmental impacts. By understanding these dynamics, municipalities can develop more effective waste management policies that promote sustainability.</description>

      <title>Carbon emission reduction associated with dapagliflozin compared to standard of care in the UK: translating the DAPA-HF and DELIVER trial findings to an environmental context</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/eurheartj/ehae666.3618</link>
      <description>P. W. Ewan, Jihua Chen, Gwilym Roberts, Katherine Mullin, Laia Falc&#243;n, Mart&#237;n Cowie, European Heart Journal. 45(Supplement_1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403819082

                Abstract Background Healthcare systems account for 4&#8211;5% of UK national greenhouse gas emissions with delivery of care a major component.1 Preventing events that use healthcare resources should contribute to a reduction in emissions, in addition to the primary humanitarian aim of improving patient outcomes. The Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse-outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) and the Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the Lives of Patient with Preserved Ejection Fraction Heart Failure (DELIVER) trials demonstrated that dapagliflozin reduced the frequency of hospitalizations for heart failure (hHF), urgent heart failure visits (UHFV) and cardiovascular (CV) death for patients with heart failure (HF).2,3 Purpose The study objective was to translate predicted differences in clinical events associated with dapagliflozin use in HF to a predicted carbon emission reduction from a UK perspective. Methods A previously published model4 based on pooled DAPA-HF and DELIVER event rates was used to predict hHF, UHFV and CV deaths in a cohort of 1,000 HF patients over a 3-year time horizon. Composite greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (as kg CO2 equivalent) were calculated from components sourced from the Sustainable Healthcare Coalition&#8217;s Care Pathway Calculator according to assumed clinical pathways and were applied to predicted incidence of hHF, UHFV and CV death events. Average length of stay was sourced from the National Heart Failure Audit.5 CV deaths occurring outside hospital were assumed to incur no additional carbon emission except that associated with cremation. Proportion of funerals by cremation and associated GHG emissions were sourced from literature.6,7 Future emissions were not discounted, representing the NHS&#8217;s aim to approach &#8216;net zero&#8217;. Results Over a 3-year time horizon, treatment with dapagliflozin was projected to prevent 74 hHF events, 9 UHFV events and 20 CV deaths per 1,000 patients treated versus placebo. Total estimated GHG emissions associated with hHF (233.2 kg CO2e), UHFV (177.4 kg CO2e), and CV death (251.4 kg CO2e) were 85,660 kg CO2e per 1,000 patients treated with dapagliflozin versus 109,618 kg CO2e per 1,000 patients treated with placebo. The projected total reduction associated with dapagliflozin treatment was 23,958 kg CO2e over 3 years, a 22% reduction versus placebo. Per population (~690,000 HF patients), total emissions prevented by dapagliflozin over 3 years were projected to be equivalent to driving 42 million miles in an average gasoline-powered passenger vehicle. Conclusion While the main aim of any therapeutic intervention is to save lives and improve patient outcomes, to capture the full spectrum of benefit to stakeholders the environmental consequences of new therapies should be considered in addition to their clinical and economic effects. Our analysis suggests treating patients with dapagliflozin may contribute to reducing the environmental burden of HF in addition to improving patient outcomes.</description>

                Biofuels are the most essential types of alternative fuels, which currently have significant potential to reduce CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels. Methanol is a more efficient fuel than petrol due to its physicochemical properties, such as a higher latent heat of vaporization, research octane number, and heat of combustion of the fuel&#8211;air mixture. Also, biomethanol is cheaper than traditional petrol and diesel fuel for agricultural countries. The authors have proposed a new approach to improve the characteristics and efficiency of methanol diesel engines by using biomethanol mixed with hydrogen instead of pure biomethanol. Using a hydrogen&#8211;biomethanol mixture in modern engines is an effective method because hydrogen is a carbon-free, low-ignition, highest-flame-rate, high-octane fuel. A small quantity of hydrogen added to biomethanol and its combustion in an engine with a heat exchanger increases the combustion temperature and heat release, increases engine power, and reduces fuel consumption. This article presents experimental results of methanol combustion and a hydrogen-in-methanol mixture if hydrogen was retained due to the utilization of the heat of the exhaust gases. The tests were carried on a single-cylinder experimental engine with an injection of liquid methanol and gaseous hydrogen mixtures. The experiments showed that green hydrogen generated onboard the car due to the utilization of heat significantly reduced fuel costs of engines of vehicles and technological installations. It was established a hydrogen gaseous mixture addition of up to 5% by mass to methanol requires a corresponding change in the coefficient of excess air to &#955; = 1.25. Also, using an additional hydrogen mixture requires adjustment at the ignition moment in the direction of its decrease by 4&#8211;5 degrees of the engine crankshaft. Hydrogen gas mixture addition reduced methanol consumption, reaching a maximum reduction of 24%. The maximum increase in power was 30.5% based on experimental data. The reduction in the specified fuel consumption, obtained after experimental tests of the methanol research engine on the stand, can be implemented on the vehicle engines and technological installations equipped with an onboard heat recovery system. Such a system, due to the utilization of heat and the supply of additional hydrogen, can be implemented for engines that work on any alternative or traditional fuels.</description>

      <title>Hospital design and planning in the line of foresight of health needs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckae144.087</link>

                Abstract The health needs of the population are increasingly difficult to plan and predict. Technological progress, artificial intelligence, new medicines, but also ecological disasters, humanitarian crises, energy crisis and other challenges (as a Covid 19 pandemic) represent the image of our time. New design of hospitals should be able to respond to the challenges of the future: comprehensive provision of health services taking into account the patient&#8217;s needs, working conditions taking into account the hospital staff, energy efficiency and construction in accordance with high standards and reduction of CO2 emissions (green hospitals), to ensure alternative sources of electricity and water supply bearing in mind potential emergencies. The big challenge of long-term construction in which advanced technologies and new procedures cannot simply fit into a rigid building structure that is several decades old (example Serbia), so it is necessary to apply precise planning and efficient and high-quality construction in the next generation hospitals, taking into account current modern equipment and that which will appear in the future. Designing hospitals involves anticipating future healthcare challenges, technological advancements, demographic shifts, and changes in patient expectations. Hospitals emphasis on patient-centered design principles, creating environments that prioritize comfort, privacy, and dignity for patients and their families, accessibility and inclusivity, infection control and prevention, sustainability and resilience. Modern hospitals should create collaborative spaces for interdisciplinary teamwork and communication among healthcare providers, research and innovation units, but also community engagement and health promotion activities. Future hospital design requires strong multidisciplinary and cross-sectional cooperation, in which priority is given to architects dedicated to this field and their cooperation with public health and health management experts.</description>

                Microplastics (MPs) are plastic particles ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 &#181;m in diameter, posing a growing environmental and health risk. Composting is an excellent way to add nutrient-rich humus to the soil to boost plant development, but it also pollutes agricultural soil with MPs. Previous research has shown that MPs can threaten plant development, production, and quality, hence they must be studied. This study examined how a mixture of three MP types&#8212;polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), and polypropylene (PP)&#8212;affected greenhouse tomato plant development. MP types were spiked at 1% w/w (MPs/soil) in tomato pots, whereas non-spiked growth medium was the control. Statistical analysis was conducted using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test (95% confidence) to compare treatments and controls. Soil spiked with MPs increased chlorophyll content (SPAD), transpiration rate, photosynthetic rate, and stomata conductance by 5.16%, 16.71%, 25.81%, and 20.75%, respectively, compared to the control but decreased sub-stomata CO2 concentration by 3.23%. However, MPs did not significantly affect tomato plant morpho-physiological features (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Biochemical analysis of tomato fruits showed significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) reduction effects of MPs on carotenoid, total flavonoid, and sugar but increased protein, ascorbate, and peroxidase activity. However, there was no significant difference (p &amp;gt; 0.05) in the effects of the combined MPs on total phenolic content. These data imply that whereas MPs did not influence tomato plant physiological and morphological properties, tomato fruit biochemistry was reduced. This raise concerns that an increase in MPs in soils may reduce antioxidant content and negatively affect human health contributing to a decrease in food security.</description>

      <title>Experience of Production Increases in High Run Life Wells by Injection Optimization and the Inclusion of PMM Technology</title>

                Abstract Optimizing extensive ESP fields is a mandatory task in terms of carbon footprint and efficiency. The main goal is to keep the equipment running with the best efficiency as long as possible, acknowledging the ESP will show normal wear due to the operation. This analysis focuses on enhancing energy efficiency, allowing the definition of the true production capabilities by comparing operating conditions related to the motor technologies available for generating the best opportunities of improvement. By observing the well production response to increased injection in a seemingly optimized condition, it was proceeded to replace the ESP, incorporating PMM technology and a downhole sensor. This enabled us to: Define the actual IPR curve Simulate the condition on the extracted equipment (IM without a downhole sensor) Validate the deviation in ESP system efficiency Verify ESP wear through bench testing This approach allows for a comparison of extraction efficiency and the impact of wear associated with extended equipment run life. Based on the study findings, it is inferred that in ESPs with extended run life (&amp;gt;2000 days), wear leads to a decline in energy and production efficiency, reducing efficiency by up to 18.6%. These results prompt preventive measures to optimize wells, boosting production without significantly altering energy consumption. This is achievable by transitioning to PMM-equipped systems, significantly enhancing overall efficiency. With these results, preventive actions can be taken to adapt the wells and obtain an increase in production without considerably modifying energy consumption. This is possible through changing technology, installing PMM equipment and significantly improving the efficiency of the system. In addition, it allows capturing production that was not considered, establishing the correct extractive status of the well. Additionally, the impact on energy efficiency contributes to the reduction of CO2 emissions and improvement in specific consumption (KW/m3/d). Ultimately, assessing a well's extractive condition considering wear, reduced lifting capacity, and increased power consumption of an ESP is crucial. This approach facilitates well adaptation planning, minimizing downtime impact, enhancing system efficiency, and capturing additional oil in genuinely underexploited wells, thus preventing equipment failure This analysis provides an opportunity to accurately measure production status and true well potential. Enhancing extraction in these cases can significantly boost oil production (69% of increase in total fluid and about 150% in terms of net oil). The comparison performed considers post injection changes versus adequation of the system installing motors with PMM technology also around 17% savings in terms of energy are reached.</description>

      <title>68 Feasibility of applying synchronized and proportional negative pressure ventilation in preterm infants with respiratory distress (NeoVest)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxae067.067</link>
      <description>Jennifer Beck, Christer A. Sinderby, Douglas M. Campbell, Paediatrics &amp; Child Health. 29(Supplement_1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403680957

                Abstract Background In preterm infants, application of negative pressure ventilation (NPV) may offer advantages to traditional methods of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). In a pre-clinical model, we recently described the &#8220;NeoVest&#8221;, a system consisting of a sealed abdominal interface and a ventilator that applies NPV in synchrony and in proportion to the diaphragm electrical activity (Edi) (Beck 2022). In animals with loaded breathing, the Neovest allowed a 50% reduction in Edi, and demonstrated specific diaphragm unloading, without hemodynamic effects. The NeoVest system, and its interface, have yet to be evaluated in human infants. Objectives The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of applying synchronized and proportional NPV with an abdominal interface in infants with respiratory distress. Design/Methods This is a prospective feasibility trial. The inclusion criteria were admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit with respiratory distress, birthweight&amp;gt;1.5kg, &amp;lt;6 weeks of age, FiO2 &amp;lt;0.35, clinically stable with no recent apneas and bradycardias, nCPAP &amp;lt;8 cm H2O and at least 48 hrs old, or post-extubation. After parental consent, the feeding tube was exchanged for a 6F &#8220;Edi catheter&#8221; (for feeding and measuring Edi), and sensors were placed (heart rate, oxygen saturation, transcutaneous CO2, and non-invasive blood pressure (BP)). Figure 1 shows the Neovest interface on a manikin. The five protocol steps were: nCPAP ON/NeoVest OFF (10 min), nCPAP ON/NeoVest ON (10 min), NO ASSIST (1 min), NeoVest only medium (10 min), NeoVest high (5 min), NeoVest low (5 min). Results Eight babies have been included to this point. The principal diagnoses were Respiratory Distress Syndrome and/or Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn. Mean weight was 2186&#177;480g and age 10&#177;8 days old. All babies tolerated the physical application of the vest. As shown in Figure 2, there was no significant difference in Edipk when the vest was placed (12.4&#177;5.5 vs. 11.1&#177;3.5 uV). During the period of no assist, Edipk was higher (18.8 &#177;7.3 uV) than nCPAP or NeoVest periods (p= 0.012), which were not significantly different from each other. Neural respiratory rate was the same for all periods tested. As per its design, the Neovest system delivered negative pressure in synchrony and in proportion to the Edi. Negative pressures applied (&#9633;PVEST) were -9&#177;4, -11&#177;4, and -7&#177;5 cmH2O (Figure 2) for the three NeoVest periods. All infants were clinically stable with no disruptions to vital signs. Conclusion Applying synchronized and proportional negative pressure with the NeoVest system was feasible and showed promise with regards to diaphragm unloading. Future studies are required to evaluate the NeoVest utility for longer periods and compared to other methods of respiratory support.</description>
