                In this work, a facile method to tune the carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CRR) activities of graphitic carbon nitride (GCN) was developed via the capping-agent-free involvement of a trace amount of Ag nanocrystals with a decreased size. After the optimization of experimental conditions, the CRR performance investigation confirms that Ag-GCN-0.2 exhibited a superior CRR performance, achieving a faradaic efficiency (FE) of more than 72 &#177; 1% for CO in a wide potential range from &#8722;0.6 to &#8722;1.1 V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) and a max FE of 89 &#177; 1% at an overpotential of 0.9 V with a constant current density and a well-maintained microstructure even after 12 h of electrolysis. This work provides a new route to tune the catalytical performance of GCN and pave the way for the rational design, synthesis, and accurate estimation of the GCN-based catalysts, which will be synthesized on a large scale and utilized in industries.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction to formate on tin electrode</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.148972</link>
      <description>Anoop Naikkath, Nikhil George Mohan, Kothandaraman Ramanujam, Surash Ramanathan, Chemical Engineering Journal. 482(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391112540

                Carbon dioxide can be electrochemically reduced to formate on tin electrodes. Formate is one of the most economically viable products of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). While CO2 is reduced to formate, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs concomitantly. The kinetics of CO2RR and HER on the tin electrode was investigated. Potentiodynamic polarization studies were conducted in CO2 saturated and N2 saturated 0.1 M KHCO3 solutions, in the potential range from &#8722;0.014 V to &#8722;1.59 V vs. RHE. A faradaic efficiency of 93.95 % towards formate production was obtained at &#8722;1.09 V vs. RHE. The mass transfer effects and bicarbonate dissociation equilibrium were used to estimate the concentration of the reactants at the electrode surface. Density functional theory calculations indicate that &#8211;OCHO intermediate species is thermodynamically favoured, and a four-step reaction with two intermediates is proposed. The proposed mechanism captures the major features of the polarization data. CO2 reduction occurs via two intermediate species, viz. adsorbed H and OCHO species, while HER occurs via Volmer-Heyrovsky steps. The model predicts that in N2 saturated solutions, the fractional surface coverage of adsorbed H reaches a maximum of &#8764;0.48 at a potential of &#8722;0.82 V vs. RHE while in CO2 saturated solutions, the corresponding value is &#8764;0.29. In addition, the maximum fractional surface coverage of adsorbed OCHO is predicted to be &#8764;0.12 in CO2 saturated solutions.</description>

                The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2 RR) involves a multistep proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) process that generates a variety of intermediates, making it challenging to transform them into target products with high activity and selectivity. Here, we report a catalyst featuring a nanosheets-stacked sphere structure with numerous open and deep conical cavities (OD-CCs). Under the guidance of finite-element method (FEM) simulations and theoretical analysis, we showed that exerting control over the confinement space resulted in diffusion limitation of the carbon intermediates, thereby increasing local pressure and subsequently enhancing localized *CO coverage for dimerization. The nanocavities exhibited a structure-driven shift in selectivity of multi-carbon (C2+ ) product from 41.8% to 81.7% during the CO2 RR process. This article is protected by copyright.

      <title>Free&#8208;standing Stanene for High Selectivity of Formate in Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction Reaction</title>

                Abstract As well&#8208;known electrocatalysts with good catalytic efficiency for carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) towards the production of formate, tin (Sn)&#8208;based catalysts have aroused broad concern. Here, free&#8208;standing porous stanene is synthesized for the first time by a facile wet chemical method, and its excellent electrocatalytic performance for formate (HCOO &#8722; ) formation in CO 2 RR is demonstrated. High Faradaic efficiency (F.E., 93% at &#8722;930 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) can be achieved in the CO 2 RR catalyzed by stanene in 0.5 m KHCO 3 aqueous solution. The in situ M&#246;ssbauer spectra reveal that zero&#8208;valent Sn aids in improving the selectivity of formate production. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations suggest that the high selectivity of HCOO &#8722; of CO 2 RR on stanene mainly originates from the edge sites on Sn (100). To further explore the practicability of the stanene&#8208;based catalysts for CO 2 RR, stanene decorated by 3 wt% BP&#8208;2000 is prepared, showing an excellent F.E. of 98% at &#8722;930 mV versus RHE due to the higher exposure of catalytic active sites. These new findings of the activity origination and reaction mechanism of stanene contribute to the deeper understanding of Sn&#8208;based catalysts for CO 2 RR, which is beneficial for the future designation of highly efficient CO 2 RR catalysts.</description>

      <title>Exploring Carbon Monoxide and Carbon Dioxide Adsorption on (5,5) Aluminum Nitride Nanotubes for Enhanced Sensor Applications: A DFT Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29030557</link>
      <description>Nafiu Suleiman, Vitus A. Apalangya, Bismark Mensah, Kwabena Kan-Dapaah, Abu Yaya, Molecules. 29(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391136623

                This study examined the sensitivity of single-walled (5,5) aluminium nitride nanotubes ((5,5) AlNNTs) to carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) gas molecules by performing DFT calculations using a hybrid functional, specifically, B3LYP (Becke&#8217;s three-parameter, Lee-Yang-Parr) exchange-correlation functional at a 6&#8211;31G* basis set. This research investigates the adsorption behavior of CO2 and CO molecules on pristine and silicon-doped aluminum nitride nanotubes (AlNNTs) and examines their implications for sensor applications. The study assesses each system&#8217;s adsorption energy, sensing potential, and recovery time to gain insights into their binding strength and practical viability. For CO2 adsorption on (5,5) AlNNT, significant adsorption energy of &#8722;24.36 kcal/mol was observed, indicating a strong binding to the nanotube surface, with a sensing potential of 8.95%. However, the slow recovery time of approximately 4.964 days may limit its real-time application. Si-(5,5) AlNNT exhibited a CO2 adsorption energy of &#8722;19.69 kcal/mol, a sensing potential of 5.40%, and a relatively short recovery time of approximately 2.978 min, making it a promising candidate for CO2 sensing. CO adsorption on (5,5) AlNNT showed an adsorption energy of &#8722;25.20 kcal/mol, a sensing potential of 9.095%, but a longer recovery time of approximately 20.130 days. Si-(5,5) AlNNT displayed a high CO adsorption energy of &#8722;20.78 kcal/mol, a sensing potential of 4.29%, and a recovery time of approximately 18.320 min. These findings provide insights into the adsorption characteristics of carbon molecules on AlNNTs, highlighting their potential for CO2 and CO sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Steering the Selectivity of Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction from Single-Carbon to Multicarbon Products on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via Facet Engineering</title>

                Although metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted more attention for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), obtaining multicarbon products with a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) remains challenging, especially under neutral conditions. Here, we report the controlled synthesis of stable Cu(I) 5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole framework (Cu-MMT) nanostructures with different facets by rationally modulating the reaction solvents. Significantly, Cu-MMT nanostructures with (001) facets are acquired using isopropanol as a solvent, which favor multicarbon production with an FE of 73.75% and a multicarbon:single-carbon ratio of 3.93 for CO2RR in a neutral electrolyte. In sharp contrast, Cu-MMT nanostructures with (100) facets are obtained utilizing water, promoting single-carbon generation with an FE of 63.98% and a multicarbon: single-carbon ratio of only 0.18. Furthermore, this method can be extended to other Cu-MMT nanostructures with different facets in tuning the CO2 reduction selectivity. This work opens up new opportunities for the highly selective and efficient CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon products on MOFs via facet engineering.</description>

      <title>Selectively Adsorbed Mercaptoethanesulfonic Acid on Au/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Enhances the Yield and Selectivity of Photocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>

                The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) is of paramount importance in the energy industry and environmental protection. Developing highly efficient catalysts plays a central role in advancing CO2RR for practical applications, and a Au/TiO2 heterostructure has emerged as a prominent photocatalyst in CO2RR. However, there is still a need to improve the reaction efficiency and selectivity of this heterostructure to realize its full potential in practical applications. Herein, a significant enhancement in the total gas-production rate on the Au/TiO2 heterostructure is achieved by selectively adsorbing thiol molecules, specifically mercaptoethanesulfonic acid, onto the gold surface. Remarkably, the selectivity toward carbon monoxide has also improved from 62.3 to 79.3%. Notably, the reaction rate and selectivity are strongly influenced by the choice of thiol molecules, their concentration, and the wavelength of light used for illumination. The improved reaction efficiency and selectivity can be attributed to the promotion of charge transfer at the Au&#8211;TiO2 interface induced by molecular adsorption of thiols. This phenomenon leads to enhanced performance in the photocatalytic CO2RR process. Importantly, this work presents a simple, convenient, cost-effective, and controllable strategy to improve the reaction efficiency and selectivity of photocatalytic CO2RR on the Au/TiO2 heterostructure. Furthermore, this strategy holds promise for application in various other heterogeneous photocatalytic systems in the near future.</description>

      <title>Effective reduction on flame soot via plasma coupled with carbon dioxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.133669</link>
      <description>Dandan Qi, Mingxiao Chen, Kaixuan Yang, Tianjiao Li, Yaoyao Ying, Dong Liu, Journal of Hazardous Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391451084

                This study explored the impact of non-thermal plasma and CO2 on the flame soot characteristics within the diffusion flames. We analyzed on flame structures that were diluted with either CO2 or N2, temperature distributions, and soot characteristics, both in the presence and absence of plasma. Due to the higher specific heat capacity of CO2 compared to N2, the optical observations consistently showed lower temperatures in flames diluted with CO2 as compared to those diluted with N2. The inclusion of plasma and carbon dioxide resulted in the lowest soot concentration, indicating that plasma coupled with CO2 has a synergistic inhibitory effect on soot emissions. The findings revealed that when CO2 was used to dilute the flames and the oxygen concentration was low, the soot nanostructure appeared amorphous. Raman results showed that the level of graphitization observed in soot particles from CO2 dilution flames was lower than that from N2 dilution flames. In the presence of plasma and CO2, the soot obtained exhibited the shortest fringe length and the highest fringe tortuosity. Significant correlations were observed between the nanostructure of soot and its reactivity. The combined application of plasma and CO2 proved to be effective in reducing the soot carbonization degree. Soot particles produced during incomplete combustion not only reduce the performance of the combustion system but also cause significant environmental pollution and health problems. Oxygen-fuel combustion integrated with O2/CO2 as an oxidant instead of O2/N2 has drawn extensive attention due to its unique advantages in reducing soot and NOx generation and combining with CO2 recycling technologies. This topic provides a detailed and profound understanding of the mechanisms behind soot suppression through the combined effects of CO2 addition and plasma activation.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Interplay of the Br&#248;nsted Acidity of Catalyst Ancillary Groups and the Solution Components in Iron-porphyrin-Mediated Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>

                The rapid and efficient conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon monoxide (CO) is an ongoing challenge. Catalysts based on iron-porphyrin cores have emerged as excellent electrochemical mediators of the two proton + two electron reduction of CO2 to CO, and many of the design features that promote function are known. Of those design features, the incorporation of Br&#248;nsted acids in the second coordination sphere of the iron ion has a significant impact on catalyst turnover kinetics. The Br&#248;nsted acids are often in the form of hydroxyphenyl groups. Herein, we explore how the acidity of an ancillary 2-hydroxyphenyl group affects the performance of CO2 reduction electrocatalysts. A series of meso-5,10,15,20-tetraaryl porphyrins were prepared where only the functional group at the 5-meso position has an ionizable proton. A series of cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments reveal that the complex with &#8722;OMe positioned para to the ionizable &#8722;OH shows the largest CO2 reduction rate constants in acetonitrile solvent. This is the least acidic &#8722;OH of the compounds surveyed. The turnover frequency of the &#8722;OMe derivative can be further improved with the addition of 4-trifluoromethylphenol to the solution. In contrast, the iron-porphyrin complex with &#8722;CF3 positioned opposite the ionizable &#8722;OH shows the smallest CO2 reduction rate constants, and its turnover frequency is less enhanced with the addition of phenols to the reaction solutions. The origin of this effect is rationalized based on kinetic isotope effect experiments and density functional calculations. We conclude that catalysts with weaker internal acids coupled with stronger external acid additives provide superior CO2 reduction kinetics.</description>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction carries tremendous significance to tackle the exponential rising of CO2 level in the atmosphere. The development of different classes of electrocatalyst materials emerged with more understanding of the catalyst features, reaction mechanism, catalytic efficiency, and product selectivity using modern analytical tools (such as in situ techniques). Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are a new class of material that allows atom-by-atom utilization in the catalytic process, thereby influencing the CO2 reduction efficiency and product selectivity in more precise manner. In this chapter, we highlight the fundamental of CO2 electroreduction, including general mechanism for varied product formation, electrolyzer component, operational parameter, and development of SACs electrode material for CO2 reduction.</description>

      <title>Determining kinetics of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction to carbon monoxide with scanning electrochemical microscopy</title>

                This study reports on determining kinetics of electrochemical reduction CO2 to CO on Au catalysts using the substrate generation/tip collection (SG/TC) mode of scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). We introduced a simple but effective method based on transient technique to obtain a series of apparent heterogeneous rate constants k based on Fick&#8217;s second law by controlling the tip-substrate distance and the voltage of the substrate electrode within the SECM framework. By analysis the transient current recorded during the chronoamperometric characterization, we can successfully determine the apparent rate constant k for the simplified total conversion process of CO2 + 2H+ + 2e- &#8594; CO + H2O onto Au catalyst electrode serving as an example, which increases from 5.02 &#215; 10&#8211;2 cm&#8901;s&#8722;1 to 7.16 &#215; 10&#8211;2 cm&#8901;s&#8722;1 in the low potential range of &#8722;2.2 to &#8722;2.6 V (vs. Pt/PPy) and decreases to 6.54 &#215; 10-2 cm&#8901;s&#8722;1 at &#8211;2.8 V (vs. Pt/PPy). The method proposed here can be applied to quantitatively analyze the kinetic of CO2 electrochemical reduction reaction, and thus provide a useful tool to guide the synthesis of catalyst as well as in-situ performance evaluation.</description>

                The limiting global carbon budget underscores the urgent need for effective and ambitious climate mitigation measures across diverse sectors to curb greenhouse gas emissions and prevent further exacerbation of global warming, aligning with international agreements such as the Paris Agreement. The role of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) becomes increasingly crucial in this context, though the extent to which this applies as a complementary measure to mitigation actions still requires careful examination and quantitative analysis. In this study, we carry out an assessment contingent upon the intertwined roles of mitigation actions and the levels of CDR deployment using the Energy-Rapid Overview and Decision-Support (En-ROADS) simulation tool. We develop sectoral emission reduction assumptions and a broad portfolio of CDR archetypes and deployment levels to evaluate their impacts on the intricate climate-land-energy nexus, and global warming temperature. We find that high levels of CDR permit the continual consumption of fossil fuels, though driving substantial renewable energy consumption post-mid-century. We also observe that high levels of CDR negatively impact sustainability factors, such as reduction in agricultural farmland, which is pronounced under high mitigation actions. We observe that the largest share of CDR is in agricultural soil carbon, with its proportion ranging from 27.4 % to 31.3 % across all scenarios. In conclusion, though CDRs are what put the &#8216;net&#8217; in the &#8216;net-zero emissions&#8217; goal, they are not a silver bullet but rather a crucial piece in the complex puzzle of climate action. We recommend that CDR should be strategically deployed as complementary options to vigorous emission reduction efforts, as this paves the way towards a sustainable and balanced approach to achieving our global climate objectives.</description>

                A new-type boron carbide material has been used, as an electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to C2 and C1 based on the computational study. Within the current research, DFT was adopted to investigate the BC3 nanoflake as an electrocatalyst for the reduction of CO2. The optoelectronic attributes of the BC3 nanoflake indicated that BC3 nanoflake had a longer visible-light region and its band gap was 2.25 eV. Based on the spatial distribution of the LUMO and the HOMO, the introduction of boron extended the &#960; network of BC3 nanoflake, thereby dramatically increasing the photocatalytic efficiency. Additionally, we estimated the Gibbs free energy of each potential CO2 reaction path onto BC3 nanoflake. Based on the findings, CO2 could reduce into CH4 and CH3CH2OH with low limiting potentials of &#8722;0.41 V and &#8722;0.53 V, respectively. The current study can provide useful insights into the application of BC3 nanoflake as an encouraging photocatalyst for the reduction reaction CO2.</description>

      <title>Interfacial microenvironment effects on electrochemical CO2 reduction</title>

                Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (ECR) powered by renewable energy has the potential to utilize the intermittent renewable electric energy, alleviate the problem of excessive CO2 emissions and yield high value-added chemicals. Despite the intrinsic activity of the well-designed catalysts, subtle changes in the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface will have a significant impact on the overall reaction. The electrode and its microenvironment together determine the ECR performance. Revealing the relationship between the microenvironment of the catalyst-electrolyte interface and the ECR performance is critical for explaining the reaction mechanism and controlling the reaction process accurately. To maximize the catalytic performance includes the activity, selectivity and stability, the fundamental understanding of the interfacial microenvironment should be clarified as important as the intrinsic properties of the catalyst. Researches on the microenvironment in ECR have been gradually launched while the comprehensive discussion is scarcely. In this review, the interfacial microenvironment changes affected by multiple influence factors including the electrolyte effects (cation effect, anion effect, local pH, electrolyte type and concentration), morphological effects (tip effect, confinement effect), catalyst surface modification (surface hydrophobicity, chemical and electronic state) and electrolyzers improvement (gas diffusion electrode, membrane electrode reaction microenvironment control) are illustrated. Finally, some perspectives are offered on the basis of understanding the connection of catalytic activity and the interfacial microenvironment, these insights obtained can be applied for better control the CO2 reduction and rational design reactors.</description>

      <description>Marcela Miranda Barcelos, Maria de Lourdes Soprani Vasconcellos, Josimar Ribeiro, Processes. 12(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391384166

                Given the environmental problems caused by burning fossil fuels, it is believed that converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into chemical inputs is a great ally to generating clean energy. In this way, investigative studies related to electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RE) concerning the behavior of metal catalysts have received attention about the processes involved. CO2RE can be an important tool to mitigate the presence of this gas in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Given these considerations, in this review, we report the main catalysts used to act as CO2RE. Among them, we emphasize catalysts based on Ni, Zn, and Cu, which encompass the main properties related to the electrochemical conversion of CO2. Regarding the Cu-based catalyst, it presents high conversion efficiency but low selectivity. Furthermore, we also describe the main mechanisms related to the electrochemical conversion of CO2.</description>

      <title>Role of Flexible Operation of a Wastewater Treatment Plant in the Reduction of Its Indirect Carbon Dioxide Emissions&#8212;A Case Study</title>

                The increasing share of renewables in electricity grids comes with a challenge of energy surpluses and deficits, which needs be handled by demand side management (DSM) and storage options. Within this approach, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), with flexible energy consumption and production processes and storage units, can contribute to stabilizing the grids and integrating more renewables. In this study, the operation of a real WWTP was optimized by mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to minimize its indirect carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The operation of the WWTP was shown to be flexible in following the CO2 emission factor of the electricity grid, which was possible with the utilization of the WWTP&#8217;s storage units and flexible co-substrate feeding. As a result, by changing only the operational behavior of the WWTP, its indirect CO2 emissions decreased by 4.8% due to the higher share of renewables in the electricity grid. The CO2 emissions were shown to decrease further up to 6.9% by adding virtual storage units.</description>

      <title>Understanding of strain effect on Mo-based MXenes for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2024.159501</link>

                Strain engineering is a powerful approach to tuning the electrocatalytic properties, but the systematic understanding of the strain effect in electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) is still lacking. Here, we have extensively investigated the impact of strain on the catalytic selectivity and activity of Mo-based MXenes towards CO2RR. Our calculations suggest that strain can effectively tune the CO2 activation and reduction processes on MXenes, endowing great potential to obtain enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Notably, the activated CO2 can be selectively reduced to methane (CH4) on all electrocatalysts, which is conducive to restricting the production of HCOOH, H2CO, CH3OH and H2 (HER). Then, we highlight that compressive strains can reduce the limiting potential (UL) of CO2RR on Mo2C and Mo3C2 from &#8722;0.68 and &#8722;0.66 V to &#8722;0.49 and &#8722;0.38 V at the strain of &#8722;4%@Mo2C and &#8722;6%@Mo3C2, respectively, which are superior to benchmark Cu (2 1 1) (&#8722;0.67 V). Further mechanism analysis illuminates that the strain can significantly modify the d-band center of MXene, which endows the selective modulation of the adsorption strength of OCH2O* and HOCH2O* to achieve promoted catalytic activity. Our results provide an in-depth understanding of the strain effect and rational design principles for enhanced electrocatalytic CO2RR.</description>

                Fast industrialization and urban growth emit significant amounts of hazardous CO2, which not only produces environmental problems but also causes illness all over the world. Several technologies for purifying air and water have been developed over the last two decades, but they have all failed due to high costs, poor effectiveness, and the creation of secondary contaminants. The photochemical and electrochemical conversion of CO2 into energy-rich molecules is a novel method that can aid in environmental rehabilitation while also meeting the world&#8217;s expanding energy demands. These techniques, however, necessitate extremely selective, energetic, and long-lasting catalysts. Scientists have investigated numerous keen and multifunctional materials for the conversion of CO2 pollution into useful compounds in this area. MXenes, a type of two-dimensional (2D) material made of transition metal nitrides, carbides, and carbonitrides, have engrossed attention because of their extraordinary physicochemical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties. This chapter focuses on CO2 conversion by photochemical and electrochemical methods to valuable products, emphasizing MXene-based materials and their catalytic activity, as well as future prospects.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Water Oxidation and CO2 Reduction with a Nickel Molecular Catalyst</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29030578</link>
      <description>Hengxin Jian, Mengyu Lu, Zheng Haowen, Shuai Yan, M. Wang, Molecules. 29(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391175526

                Mimicking the photosynthesis of green plants to combine water oxidation with CO2 reduction is of great significance for solving energy and environmental crises. In this context, a trinuclear nickel complex, [NiII3(paoH)6(PhPO3)2]&#183;2ClO4 (1), with a novel structure has been constructed with PhPO32&#8722; (phenylphosphonate) and paoH (2-pyridine formaldehyde oxime) ligands and possesses a reflection symmetry with a mirror plane revealed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Bulk electrocatalysis demonstrates that complex 1 can homogeneously catalyze water oxidation and CO2 reduction simultaneously. It can catalyze water oxidation at a near-neutral condition of pH = 7.45 with a high TOF of 12.2 s&#8722;1, and the Faraday efficiency is as high as 95%. Meanwhile, it also exhibits high electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction towards CO with a TOF of 7.84 s&#8722;1 in DMF solution. The excellent electrocatalytic performance of the water oxidation and CO2 reduction of complex 1 could be attributed to the two unique &#181;3-PhPO32&#8722; bridges as the crucial factor for stabilizing the trinuclear molecule as well as the proton transformation during the catalytic process, while the oxime groups modulate the electronic structure of the metal centers via &#960; back-bonding. Therefore, apart from the cooperation effect of the three Ni centers for catalysis, simultaneously, the two kinds of ligands in complex 1 can also synergistically coordinate the central metal, thereby significantly promoting its catalytic performance. Complex 1 represents the first nickel molecular electrocatalyst for both water oxidation and CO2 reduction. The findings in this work open an avenue for designing efficient molecular electrocatalysts with peculiar ligands.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical CO2 reduction properties of boron-doped diamond powder</title>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) properties of boron-doped diamond powder (BDDP) were investigated. A BDDP-painted electrode was prepared by casting BDDP ink on the surface of a BDD thin-film electrode as a current collector. The CO2RR properties of the BDDP-painted electrode were compared to those of conventional BDD thin-film electrodes, which were prepared directly on a conductive silicon wafer substrate by the microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition method. The result of the electrolysis at &#8722;1.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl in 0.5 M KCl catholyte showed that the BDDP-painted electrode was superior to the BDD thin-film electrode because it produced a large amount of products (formic acid and carbon monoxide) at a low overpotential. The highest performance of the CO2RR in the BDDP-painted electrode was achieved with the BDDP with high boron doping and high sp2 carbon content. We considered that structural defects, boron doping level, and sp2 carbon content influenced the reactivity for CO2 reduction. Therefore, the BDDP-painted electrodes should be useful not only for the production of a large-size electrode but also for efficient CO2RR.</description>

                In this study, we conducted a theoretical exploration of haeckelite-mediated CO2 reduction with molecular hydrogen. We used a haeckelite nanoflake (NF) consisting of 96 carbon atoms passivated with hydrogens to elucidate the reaction mechanism on the 2D surface. The most favorable reaction pathway involves the sequential formation of formic acid, formaldehyde, methanol, and ultimately methane. Notably, formic acid formation is favored over carbon monoxide. Haeckelite-mediated reactions exhibit Gibbs-free activation energies 10 to 40 kcal/mol lower compared to processes without a catalyst. This catalytic effect is attributed to the interaction of H2 with the haeckelite surface, which weakens or breaks the HH bond. This theoretical perspective provides significant insights into carbon-based materials and their potential applications in transforming CO2 into fuels and value-added chemicals.</description>

                Solar-driven carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction integrated with selective organic synthesis proposes a sustainable paradigm to achieve carbon neutrality concomitantly with value-added fuels and chemicals production. Here, we report the synergistic coupling reaction of CO2 reduction and amines oxidation to syngas and secondary amines over Cu doped CdS quantum dots (Cu:CdS QDs) under visible light. This system is compatible with various amines to afford the corresponding secondary amines with outstanding selectivity. Notably, the syngas CO/H2 ratio can be obtained in a window from 1:2 to 2:1 by altering the Cu doping content. Mechanistic studies unveil that doped Cu not only improves the charge separation efficiency, but also serves as active sites for the adsorption/activation of CO2, thus adjusting the syngas ratio. This work is envisaged to enable a viable strategy for the rational design of transition metal-doped semiconductor QDs toward the co-production of syngas and high-value chemicals in one photoredox cycle.</description>
