                Modification of titanium dioxide using ethylenediamine (EDA), diethylamine (DEA), and triethylamine (TEA) has been studied. As the reference material, titanium dioxide prepared by the sol&#8211;gel method using titanium(IV) isopropoxide as a precursor was applied. The preparation procedure involved heat treatment in the microwave reactor or in the high-temperature furnace. The obtained samples have been characterized in detail. The phase composition was determined through the X-ray diffraction method, and the average crystallite size was calculated based on it. Values for specific surface areas and the total pore volumes were calculated based on the isotherms obtained through the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption method. The bang gap energy was estimated based on Tauc&#8217;s plots. The influence of the type and content of amine, as well as heat treatment on the photocatalytic activity of modified titanium dioxide in the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide, was determined and discussed. It was clear that, regardless of the amount and content of amine introduced, the higher photoactivity characterized the samples prepared in the microwave reactor. The highest amounts of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane have been achieved using triethylamine-modified titanium dioxide.</description>

                The design and synthesis of hybrid borates by the organic ligand modification method are urgent and undeveloped areas of research. It is difficult to directly integrate organoboronic acids within inorganic borate chemistry by adopting the traditional preparation approaches. This work reports a facile synthetic method to synthesize a large family of pyrazole molecule&#8208;protected borates in a rapid and precise manner under mild conditions. A unique cyclic eight&#8208;membered B4O4&#8208;ring has been identified as the cluster core for all these hybrid borates with two different conformations (boat and crown). This strategy can be applied to a system of pyrazolyl molecules to generate such hybrid borates in two independent routes from organoboronic or inorganic boric acids. Furtherly, the mechanism of &#8216;click reaction&#8217; between boric acid and pyrazole induced by copper ions has been proposed based on the synthetic conditions and the structure of intermediate. Due to the bimetallic Cu sites and the functional surfaces, these materials can be used as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction and efficiently enhance the selectivity of HCOOH and C2H4. Our strategy can be regarded as a typical template technique for organic molecule&#8208;protected borates.</description>

      <title>Simplification of clean development mechanism to measure CO2 emission reductions from shifting private transportation to mass rapid transit: a case study of MRT Jakarta Phase 1</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.155406.1</link>
      <description>Nunuj Nurdjanah, Tri Edhi Budhi Soesilo, K. Mizuno, Raldi Hendro Koestoer, F1000Research. 13(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402579361

                Background The Indonesian government built the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) in Jakarta to reduce traffic congestion and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The objective of this study is to estimate the CO2 emissions reductions from switching from private transport to MRT by using a methodology proposed by the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for developing countries, namely the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) methodology, which generates Certified Emission Reductions (CERs). This methodology is more comprehensive than other available methodologies. However, this method has not been widely used to calculate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions in mass transit projects because it is complex enough to require a lot of data based on primary surveys. Therefore, this research simplifies the CDM formula to make it easier and applicable in Indonesia. Methods The primary data were collected using a questionnaire distributed to 480 MRT Jakarta Phase 1 user respondents in September 2019 (baseline); the secondary data were obtained from The MRT Jakarta. The data were processed using IBM SPSS Statistics 27. The simplified Clean Development Mechanism Approved Consolidated Methodology 0016 (CDM ACM 0016) was the analysis method used. Result The results of this study indicate that 53.75% of MRT Jakarta Phase 1 users are shifting from private transportation, which has reduced CO2 emissions by 2,732.7 tons in 2019 and 6,043.9 tons in 2023. Increasing the number of MRT passengers who switch from private transportation will further reduce CO2 emissions. Conclusion and implications The simplified CDM ACM 0016 formula may be suitable for use in Indonesia. This would enable the measurement of CO2 emission reductions through mitigation actions through MRT development to be certified by the UNFCCC. Applying this method in calculating CO2 emission reductions, implementing strategies to increase MRT passengers, and using renewable energy electricity sources would increase CO2 emission reductions.</description>

      <title>Mini-Review on Recent Developments and Improvements in CO&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;2&amp;lt;/sub&amp;gt; Catalytic Conversion to Methanol: Prospects for the Cement Plant Industry</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202409.0961.v1</link>
      <description>Lu&#237;sa Marques, Maria Clara Vieira, Jos&#233; Conde&#231;o, Carlos Henriques, Maria Margarida Mateus, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402532128

                The cement industry has significant environmental impacts, stemming from natural resources extraction and fossil fuels combustion. Notably, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are a major concern associated with cement production. The cement industry emits 0.6 tons of CO2 per ton of cement production, which is around 8 % of the total CO2 emissions in the world. Meeting the 13th United Nations Sustainable Goals, cement plants aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, resulting from reduction in CO2 emissions (change in the composition of cementitious materials) and the adoption of carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technologies. A promising approach involves converting CO&#8322; into valuable chemicals and fuels, such as methanol (MeOH) through the power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies. In this process, CO2 captured from cement industry flue gas with hydrogen generated from renewable sources through electrolysis of water, catalytically transformed into renewable methanol (e-MeOH), offering a sustainable solution. To achieve this, it is crucial to advance the development of novel, highly efficient catalysts specifically designed for direct CO2 hydrogenation. In this sense, this review discusses recent developments and improvements in CO2 catalytic conversion, emphasizing catalyst performance, selectivity, and stability.</description>

      <title>The importance of an informed choice of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalence metrics for contrail avoidance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-9401-2024</link>
      <description>Audran Borella, Olivi&#233;r Boucher, Keith P. Shine, Marc Stettler, Katsumasa Tanaka, Roger Teoh, Nicolas Bellouin, Atmospheric chemistry and physics. 24(16)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402552629

                Abstract. One of the proposed ways to reduce the climate impact of civil aviation is rerouting aircraft to minimise the formation of warming contrails. As this strategy may increase fuel consumption, it would only be beneficial if the climate impact reduction from the avoided contrails exceeds the negative impact of any additional carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by the rerouted flight. In this study, we calculate the surface temperature response of almost half a million flights that crossed the North Atlantic sector in 2019 and compare it to the temperature response of hypothetical rerouted flights. The climate impacts of contrails and CO2 are assessed through the perspective of CO2-equivalence metrics, represented here as nine combinations of different definitions and time horizons. We estimate that the total emitted CO2 and the persistent contrails formed will have warmed the climate by 17.2 &#181;K in 2039, 13.7 &#181;K in 2069, and 14.1 &#181;K in 2119. Under an idealised scenario where 1 % additional carbon dioxide is enough to reroute all contrail-forming flights and avoid contrail formation completely, total warming would decrease by 4.9 (&#8722;28 %), 2.6 (&#8722;19 %), and 1.9 (&#8722;13 %) &#181;K in 2039, 2069, and 2119, respectively. In most rerouting cases, the results based on the nine different CO2-equivalence metrics agree that rerouting leads to a climate benefit, assuming that contrails are avoided as predicted. But the size of that benefit is very dependent on the choice of CO2-equivalence metrics, contrail efficacy and CO2 penalty. Sources of uncertainty not considered here could also heavily influence the perceived benefit. In about 10 % of rerouting cases, the climate damage resulting from contrail avoidance indicated by CO2-equivalence metrics integrated over a 100-year time horizon is not predicted by metrics integrated over a 20-year time horizon. This study highlights, using North Atlantic flights as a case study, the implications of the choice of CO2-equivalence metrics for contrail avoidance, but the choice of metric implies a focus on a specific climate objective, which is ultimately a political decision.</description>

                The key towards a sustainable future is the reduction of mankind&amp;rsquo;s impact on natural systems via the development of new technologies and the improvement of source apportionment. Though days, years and seasons are arbitrarily set, their mechanisms are based on natural cycles driven by Earth&amp;rsquo;s orbital periods. This is not the case for weeks, which are a pure anthropic category and are known from literature to influence emission cycles. For the first time since it started data gathering operations, CO (carbon monoxide), CO2 (carbon dioxide), CH4 (methane) and eBC (equivalent black carbon) values detected by the Lamezia Terme WMO/GAW station in Calabria, Southern Italy have been evaluated via a two-pronged approach accounting for weekly variations in absolute concentrations, as well as the number of hourly averages exceeding select thresholds. The analyses were performed on seven continuous years of measurements, from 2016 to 2022. Moreso, the two results have been combined into a new parameter: the hereby defined WDWO (Weighed Distribution of Weekly Outbreaks) normalizes weekly trends of CO, CO2, CH4 and eBC on an absolute scale as percentages, with the scope of providing regulators and researchers alike with a new tool meant to better evaluate anthropogenic pollution and mitigate its effects.</description>

      <title>Carbon dioxide sequestration in brackish water: Principles, techniques and environmental benefits</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.61173/1njx1r03</link>
      <description>Zuhong Gong, Science and Technology of Engineering Chemistry and Environmental Protection. 1(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402576747

                Carbon dioxide storage is a technology to separate carbon dioxide gas from the atmosphere and inject it into the brackish water layer to achieve the purpose of carbon dioxide emission reduction. In this way, carbon dioxide is dissolved in salt water and then sequestered in deep underground water layers, preventing it from being released into the atmosphere and causing a greenhouse effect. This technology can effectively reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but also can use geological structures for storage, has great potential application prospects. It is important to note that further research and practice is needed to address possible environmental risks and costs.</description>

      <title>PSV-14 The effects of calcium cyanamide on greenhouse gases, ammonia emissions, and the microbiome of dairy cattle lagoon water</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skae234.585</link>
      <description>Alice S. Rocha, Bryan Morales, Hamed M. El&#8208;Mashad, Yuee Pan, Yongjing Zhao, Frank M. Mitloehner, Journal of Animal Science. 102(Supplement_3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402533394

                Abstract Dairy manure management is responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in California. Aside from redesigning infrastructure to adopt alternative manure management systems, there are few options available to farmers to mitigate emissions without substantial financial investment. Calcium cyanamide, a new manure additive, showed significant reductions in GHG emissions when applied to fresh dairy cow slurry, but has not been tested on dairy lagoon water. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of calcium cyanamide on GHG and NH3 emissions and the microbiome of dairy lagoon water. Lagoon water was collected from a commercial dairy, and distributed into 12 stainless steel barrels. Three treatments (n = 4/treatment) of different doses of calcium cyanamide were tested: high (LW-HD; 1 kg/m3 lagoon water), low (LW-LD; 0.5 kg/m3 lagoon water), and control with no calcium cyanamide (LW-CONT; n = 4). Each barrel was sampled over two, 14-d periods, staggered to four barrels at a time, using OdoFlux chambers to monitor emissions for carbon dioxide (CO2,), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ammonia (NH3). Treatments LW-LD and LW-HD contained significantly more total solids, total nitrogen and total carbon compared with LW-CONT. There was also a significantly greater concentration of acetic acid in LW-LD and LW-HD treatments compared with LW-CONT. CO2 emissions in LW-LD and LW-HD were 2.96% and 12.03% less than LW-CONT. CH4 emissions in LW-LD and LW-HD were 80.9% and 85.13% less compared with LW-CONT. N2O emissions in LW-LD and LW-HD were 81.1% and 82.66% less than LW-CONT. However, NH3 fluxes were greater in LW-LD and LW-HD compared with LW-CONT by 65.26% and 65.73%, respectively. The microbiome of the lagoon water was also affected, with reductions in relative abundance of the Proteobacteria phylum responsible for nitrification in LW-LD and LW-HD and increases in the Firmicutes phylum containing acetogenic bacteria. Calcium cyanamide could inhibit methanogenesis by increasing acetogenic bacteria that compete with methanogens for fermentation substrates. Further research is needed to investigate the efficacy of calcium cyanamide in a commercial lagoon setting.</description>

      <title>The interaction between China&#8217;s economic recovery and environmental governance: a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and resource management</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1459483</link>
      <description>Yuting Duan, Frontiers in Environmental Science. 12(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402529246

                To gain a deeper understanding of the intrinsic dynamic relationship between energy consumption and economic growth in China. This study employs panel cointegration and causality models, utilizing the SYS-GMM technique to assess the factors influencing economic growth in China&#8217;s green finance sector from 2002 to 2022. The research explores the interactions among multiple variables related to the Chinese economic context, including economic growth, carbon dioxide emissions, total natural resource rents, energy consumption, and environmental impact. While considering key factors that may cause structural disturbances in the time series analysis. The findings indicate the existence of long-term cointegration relationships among these variables, with positive correlations between economic growth and total natural resource rents, energy consumption, energy quantity, and ecological footprint. Results also show a bidirectional causal relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption and a unidirectional correlation between energy consumption and GDP growth. Additionally, energy intensity (EI) improvements supported by green finance are linked to a significant reduction in CO 2 emissions, with a coefficient of &#8722;1.933 ( p &amp;lt; 0.05), underscoring the role of technological innovation. Further evaluations suggest that investments in renewable energy can promote economic growth, create job opportunities, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Energy-saving measures and green finance-supported technological innovations play crucial roles in improving energy intensity and reducing CO 2 emissions. The study also underscores the importance of economic diversification to reduce dependence on natural resources and enhance economic stability. Future research should further explore the economic feasibility and environmental benefits of emerging technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), providing deeper insights into sustainable energy practices.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Hydrazine Alternatives to Water Treatment in Power Plants: Effects of Hydrazine Alternatives and Decomposition Products on Water Properties and Corrosion of Carbon Steel</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5006/4621</link>

                ABSTRACT The applicability of carbohydrazide (CHZ) and diethylhydroxilamine (DEHA) as hydrazine alternatives to the water treatment of water-steam circuits of power plants was investigated by assessing their effects on the corrosion of carbon steel and water properties, including the conductivity, conductivity after cation exchange (cation conductivity), dissolved-oxygen concentration (DO), and oxidation&#8211;reduction potential (ORP) of high-temperature water under simulated conditions of boiler feed water of power plants. Hydrazine and carbon dioxide were generated by CHZ decomposition, resulting in a decrease in DO and increases in both conductivity and cation conductivity. Various substances including diethylamine, ethylamine, and acetaldehyde were generated by DEHA decomposition, and the amines increased conductivity. Under the oxygen-containing condition, acetate was also formed, and cation conductivity was increased by DEHA injection. Measurements of DO and ORP suggested that high CHZ and DEHA concentrations or temperatures were required for them to exert their oxygen-scavenging effect and decrease the electrode potential of metals like hydrazine. Irrespective of the decomposition products of CHZ or DEHA, neither of these hydrazine alternatives accelerated the corrosion of carbon steel. In this study, various characteristics of CHZ and DEHA were clarified, and results suggest that CHZ is a safe choice, as long as hydrazine generation by CHZ decomposition does not conflict with hydrazine restriction.</description>

      <title>Reducing the carbon footprint for a 30-bed haemodialysis unit by changing the delivery of acid concentrate supplied by individual 5 L containers to a central delivery system</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s40620-024-02073-9</link>
      <description>Gareth Murcutt, Rosie Hillson, Cate Goodlad, Andrew Davenport, Journal of Nephrology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402599258

                Abstract Background Haemodialysis treatments generate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mainly as a result of the equipment, consumables and pharmaceuticals required. An internal audit demonstrated a 33% wastage of acid concentrate when using individual 5.0 L containers at a 1:44 dilution ratio. We therefore investigated whether changing the delivery system for acid concentrate would reduce wastage and any associated greenhouse gas emissions. Methods We calculated the difference for a 30-bed dialysis unit between receiving acid concentrate in single-use 5.0 L plastic containers versus bulk delivery for a central acid delivery system connected to the dialysis machines. Estimates of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions were made using the United Kingdom government database and other sources. Results A 30-station dialysis unit functioning at maximum capacity (3 shifts and 6 days/week), switching to bulk delivery and central acid delivery could realise an approximate total reduction of 33,841 kgCO 2 e/year; in reduced product wastage, saving 6192 kgCO 2 e, 5205 kgCO 2 e from fewer deliveries, and 22,444 kgCO 2 e saving from a reduction in packaging and waste generated, which equates approximately to a one tonne reduction in CO 2 e emissions per dialysis station/year. Conclusions Switching from delivering acid concentrate in individual 5.0 L containers to a central acid delivery system can result in substantial reductions in CO 2 e emissions within a dialysis clinic. The emission savings from reducing the single-use plastic packaging greatly outweigh any gains from eliminating wastage of acid concentrate. Dialysis companies and clinicians should consider reviewing the design of current and future dialysis facilities and policies to determine whether reductions in CO 2 e emissions can be made.

      <title>The effects of metal oxides doping on the surface stability of In2O3 for CO2 hydrogenation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0224256</link>
      <description>Xingtang Xu, Yanwei Li, Zhenhua Tao, Jianliang Cao, Yan Wang, Xu-Long Qin, AIP Advances. 14(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402513197

                The significance of maintaining the surface stability of the In2O3 catalyst in the conversion of CO2 to methanol through hydrogenation cannot be overstated. To improve surface stability, doping with metal oxides is usually employed. To explore high-efficiency In2O3 based catalysts, density functional theory calculations were utilized to explore the effects of doping CuO, Co2O3, NiO, TiO2, HfO2, Nb2O3, Ta2O5, and CeO2 on the stability of the In2O3(110) surface. It was found that in a CO atmosphere, the crucial step in determining the creation of oxygen vacancies on the In2O3 plane occurred during the desorption of CO2 from the vacancy location. The results indicate that doping CuO, Co2O3, NiO, Nb2O3, Ta2O5, and CeO2 on the In2O3(110) surface promotes the reduction process through the reaction of CO with the O atoms on the surface, resulting in reduced surface stability. Conversely, the doping of Ti and Hf can raise the reaction energy barriers for CO reacting with the O atoms on the surface and enhance CO2 molecule adsorption on vacant sites, thereby suggesting the potential of TiO2 and HfO2 as effective modifiers to improve the efficiency and durability of the In2O3 catalyst. Furthermore, it is crucial to enhance its stability by modifying the density of the electron cloud or Fermi level of the In2O3 catalyst.</description>

                Abstract Livestock methane (CH4) emissions total over 3 billion tonnes per year of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) and are responsible for approximately 6% of total annual greenhouse gas emissions. The contribution of livestock CH4 emissions are only to be exacerbated as the global demand for meat and dairy products increases. Greater than 75% of livestock CH4 emissions are generated in dispersed production environments (e.g., cow-calf and stocker segments), which are not addressable by methane mitigation strategies requiring constant inputs. Thus, strategies that fit into standard agronomic practices, in particular dispersed production environments, are urgently needed to address the increasing carbon footprint associated with livestock production. Methane-reducing vaccines are a promising solution for addressing this need, due to their longevity of action, low cost, and ease of integration into standard agronomic practices, which could lower the barrier for adoption. Thus, this study aimed to assess the effects of a prototype vaccine on total and antigen-specific immune response, CH4 yield, and average daily gain (ADG) in cattle. Angus crossbred steers [n = 20; initial body weight (BW) = 537 &#177; 15 kg) fed on a high-forage diet were randomly assigned to either placebo- or vaccine-treated groups blocked by BW, breed, and feed intake. Steers were subcutaneously inoculated (2 mL dose) in the anterior region of the neck. Blood and saliva samples were collected, and total sera and salivary immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA were quantified using ELISA (Bethyl laboratories, Montgomery, TX). Antigen-specific sera IgG was measured using ELISA. Daily CH4 emissions and dry matter intake (DMI) were measured using GreenFeed systems (C-Lock Inc. Rapid City, SD) and GrowSafe feed bunks (Vytelle, Lenexa, KS), respectively. Body weights were recorded bi-weekly. Total sera IgA and IgG did not differ between the placebo-treated and vaccinated steers (P = 0.584 and P = 0.425, respectively), nor did total salivary IgA and IgG (P = 0.577 and P = 0.548, respectively). However, antigen-specific sera IgG did significantly increase following booster vaccination in the vaccinated steers, as compared with placebo-treated steers (d 0 vs. d 28; P &amp;lt; 0.001). CH4 yield was significantly reduced in vaccinated steers following booster vaccination despite significantly increasing in placebo-treated steers over the same period (P = 0.002). This reduction in CH4 yield was not associated with a reduction in DMI nor ADG (P = 0.181 and P = 0.314, respectively), suggesting that vaccination did not negatively affect treated animals. These findings underscore the potential of vaccine-based solutions to mitigate the environmental impact of livestock CH4 emissions, especially from dispersed production environments where current options for mitigation strategies are limited.</description>

      <title>Highly Stable Propane Dehydrogenation on a Self&#8208;supporting Single&#8208;component Zn2SiO4 Catalyst</title>

                Current industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes predominantly use either toxic Cr&#8208;based or expensive Pt&#8208;based catalysts, necessitating urgent exploration for alternatives. Herein, we present Zn2SiO4, an easily prepared, cost&#8208;effective material, as a highly efficient and stable catalyst for PDH. Uniquely, Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals do not require dispersion on support materials, commonly needed for catalytic active oxide clusters, but function as a self&#8208;supporting catalyst instead. During the reaction's induction period, surface Zn species on the Zn2SiO4 crystal reduce to coordinately unsaturated ZnOx single sites, serving as highly active catalytic centers. The Zn2SiO4 catalyst demonstrates a stable performance over 200 hours of PDH operation at 550 &#176;C. We further find that introducing a minuscule amount of CO2 into the propane feed significantly extends the catalyst lifespan to over 2000 hours. This enhancement arises from the special role of CO2 in facilitating the removal of strongly adsorbed H*, preventing the complete reduction of ZnOx. After prolonged reaction, the activity of Zn2SiO4 can be fully restored by etching the surface layer to expose fresh Zn species, available throughout the crystals. The combination of CO2 introduction and catalytic site regeneration strategies is expected to enable a year&#8208;long PDH operation using a single batch of Zn2SiO4 catalyst.</description>

                The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of hydrogen injection on the performance of a mini turbo reactor. To achieve this, an experimental test bench was constructed, incorporating a specially designed mini turbo reactor capable of operating on various fuel mixtures and a dry cell electrolyzer for on-site hydrogen production. A comprehensive testing campaign was conducted, comparing the mini turbo reactor performance when fueled with pure propane and a propane-hydrogen blend at varying concentrations. Parameters evaluated included power output, thermal efficiency, fuel mass flow rate, flame temperatures, and pollutant emissions (CO, CO2, NOx). The experimental results unequivocally demonstrated that the addition of hydrogen to propane significantly enhances the mini turbo reactor specific power while concurrently reducing CO and CO2 emissions. Furthermore, data analysis revealed an improvement in the thermal efficiency of the cycle, suggesting potential reductions in specific fuel consumption. These findings highlight the promising potential of hydrogen injection as a strategy to enhance the performance and environmental impact of mini turbo reactor.</description>

                In this investigation, an effort was made to introduce Ag into the CeO2 fluorite crystal lattice to form Ce0.99Ag0.01O2-&#948; (ACRM) using an ammonium hydroxide-assisted co-precipitation method. The resulting powder obtained after the co-precipitation reaction, filtration, and drying was annealed at 800 &#176;C in a muffle furnace to obtain crystalline ACRM. The phase composition and microstructure of the synthesized ACRM were analyzed using a powder X-ray diffractometer (PXRD) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The characterized ACRM powder was then subjected to multiple thermochemical thermal reduction (TR) and CO2 splitting (CDS) cycles using a high-temperature thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The TR step was conducted using Ar gas as an inert atmosphere, maintaining the temperature at 1400 &#176;C for 60 min. Subsequently, the same powder was subjected to the CDS step by treating it with a gaseous mixture of 50% CO2 and Ar gas at 1000 &#176;C for 30 min. ACRM displayed stable redox reactivity towards thermochemical CDS cycles by generating an average of 50.9 &#956;mol of O2/g&#183;cycle and 101.6 &#956;mol of CO/g&#183;cycle, respectively, over 10 thermochemical cycles.</description>

                In 2020, the Covid-19 outbreak led many countries across the globe to introduce lockdowns (LDs) that effectively caused most anthropic activities to either stop completely or be significantly reduced. In Europe, Italy played a pioneeristic role via the early introduction of a strict nationwide LD on March 9th. This study is aimed at evaluating, using both chemical and meteorological data, the environmental response to that occurrence as observed by the Lamezia Terme (LMT) GAW/WMO station in Calabria, Southern Italy. The first 2020 lockdown has therefore been used as a &amp;ldquo;proving ground&amp;rdquo; to assess CO, CO2, CH4, BC, and NOx concentrations in a rather unique context by exploiting the location of LMT in the context of the Mediterranean Basin. In fact, its location on the Tyrrhenian coast of Calabria and local wind circulation both lead to daily cycles where western-seaside winds depleted in anthropogenic pollutants can be easily differentiated from northeastern-continental winds, enriched in anthropogenic outputs. In addition to that, the first Italian LD occurred during the seasonal transition from Winter to Spring and, consequently, Summer, thus providing new insights on emission outputs correlated with seasons. Findings have clearly indicated BC and, in particular, CO as strongly correlated with average daily temperatures, and possibly domestic heating. CO2&amp;rsquo;s reduction during the lockdown and consequent increase in the post-lockdown period, combined with wind data, has allowed to constrain local source of emissions located northeast from LMT. NOx reductions during specific circumstances are consistent with hypotheses from previous research which linked them to rush hour traffic and other forms of transportation emissions. CH4&amp;rsquo;s stable patterns are consistent with livestock, landfills, and other sources assumed to be nearly constant during LD periods.</description>

      <title>178 Programing the rumen microbiome to optimize microbial efficiency in high forage diets</title>

      <description>Tim A. McAllister, Robert J. Gruninger, Stephanie A. Terry, Ajay Badhan, Yan Wang, Leluo Guan, Journal of Animal Science. 102(Supplement_3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402533540

                Abstract As the majority of energy and protein supplied to cattle arises as a result of ruminal fermentation, the rumen microbiome has an integral role in determining host feed efficiency. Counterintuitively, current evidence suggests that a less diverse rumen microbiome is associated with improved feed efficiency, possibly as a result of greater metabolic precision and avoidance of energy spilling fermentative pathways. The composition of the rumen microbiome is mainly determined by diet, but host traits such as rumen volume, rate of passage, rumination and immunity also have influence. Although less microbial diversity may improve feed efficiency in cattle fed a specific diet, reduced diversity may impair the ability of cattle to adapt to frequent changes in diet and the environment. Hydrogen exchange and capture is the energetic foundation of the rumen microbiome and considerable capital has been invested to develop additives that redirect hydrogen flow away from the reduction of CO2 to CH4 towards alternative sinks. These additives have been shown to reduce enteric CH4 emissions by 30 to 80%, but improvements in feed efficiency have been less than stoichiometric predictions. Approaches to improve the feed efficiency of cattle need to be multifaceted with consideration for host genetics, functional efficiency of the rumen microbiome, and the structure and composition of feed. Likewise, reductions in carbon emissions need to be broader than just CH4, with an appreciation of the role that cattle have within a circular bioeconomy to promote upcycling of nutrients and reductions in emissions from farming systems. Strategies to improve the efficiency of cattle production are a prerequisite for the sustainable intensification needed to ensure that the social license for milk and meat production from cattle is retained.</description>

                Abstract Implementing breeding strategies for a more sustainable food system is one of the most pressing topics for livestock industries. Although different species face different challenges, large-scale research projects can pave the way for future opportunities in these key sectors. Herein, we present two examples (dairy and poultry) of how research projects can result in meaningful changes to commercial breeding programs. The first example is an international large-scale dairy project, which will deliver a roadmap for greenhouse gas (GHG) management using genomics and nutrition. The project aims to facilitate a 55% reduction in GHG emissions from Canadian dairy at an estimated value of $338M CAD. This systems-level approach will leverage resources developed through previous and current large-scale projects to produce accurate multi-level emission estimates and identify opportunities to mitigate enteric GHG emissions. The results of this project will provide accurate, reliable, and robust data for industry stakeholders, national policy, and GHG inventories. The second example is a research collaboration with a commercial turkey breeding company that will enable breeding strategies for long-term and sustainable genetic improvement in health traits. This project aims to reduce preslaughter mortality by 5% and condemnations due to myopathies and health issues. This reduction alone is expected to result in 7.5M kg more turkey meat at a value of $19.8M CAD. Furthermore, there is also an expected reduction of 2.3M kg of CO2 equivalent per year for each 1% livability improvement due to production efficiencies and reduced inputs wasted for more sustainable and ethical meat production. Overall, ongoing and future research initiatives will continue to deliver solutions for key Canadian livestock sectors to improve animal health and welfare as well as efficiency and sustainability. The strides made in these ongoing collaborative projects are imperative for enhancing the sustainability of animal agriculture to feed the growing population.</description>

                Climate change may be the single largest threat facing humanity and ecosystems, necessitating decarbonization across all sectors, including healthcare and academia. With the aim of informing and supporting sustainable research practices, we performed a life cycle assessment of a clinical trial conducted in Mali. The trial involved 80 malaria-infected participants in Ou&#233;less&#233;bougou who were treated with antimalarials and followed for 28 days to determine their clinical and transmission-blocking efficacy. Data on consumables, transportation, travel, and electricity use were collected in Mali and the Netherlands, where additional laboratory analyses and sample storage occurred. Data were analysed using the ReCiPe 2016 method for midpoint impact assessment. The trial involved 3 intercontinental shipments of materials and samples, 59,900 km of travel by research staff, and ~55 kg of plastics. Trial conduct and reporting resulted in 20.5 metric tonnes of CO2-equivalent (CO2e) emissions. Major contributors were international travel (50%), electricity in Mali (28%), and air-transportation (14%). Laboratory consumables, while contributing up to 22% of the trial&#8217;s impact on land and water use, were less important sources of emissions (2% of CO2e). Whereas the electricity mix in Mali, ~60% fossil-fuel-based, was disadvantageous for the carbon footprint, laboratory analyses in the Netherlands benefited from 100% wind energy, resulting in a minor overall contribution to emissions (&amp;lt;1%). We observed no loss in stability of parasite genetic material (mRNA) in protective buffers when stored for 12 months at -20&#176;C, compared to conventional -70&#176;C. These results form a foundation for improving the environmental sustainability of clinical trials in Africa. Switching to energy-efficient equipment settings could reduce electricity consumption by over 30%. Implementing solar panels in the Mali laboratory would reduce CO2e emissions by 28%. Immediate CO2e reductions can be achieved through online conference attendance and alternative sample transportation, which would contribute an additional 10% CO2e reduction.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Plug-In Hybrid Light Duty Commercial Vehicle in Real-World Conditions by Simulation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.4271/2024-24-0016</link>
      <description>Ezio Mancaruso, Giovanni Meccariello, Simona Rossetti, SAE technical papers on CD-ROM/SAE technical paper series. 1(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402588401

                &lt;div class="section abstract"&gt;&lt;div class="htmlview paragraph"&gt;Light commercial vehicles are an indispensable element for the transport of people and the delivery of goods, especially on extra-urban and long-distance routes. With a view to sustainable mobility, it is necessary to think about hybridizing these vehicles to reduce the fuel consumption as well as greenhouse gas emissions and particulate matter. These types of vehicles are generally powered by diesel and travel many kilometers a day. On the other hand, the use of light commercial vehicles in battery electric vehicle (BEV) configuration has already been started but is not receiving widespread recognition. In this panorama, starting from a study already developed for the hybridization of a plug-in light commercial vehicle in Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC) condition, the simulation analysis has been extended to the plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) operating in real driving emission conditions (RDE). In particular, using Advisor software, a vehicle has been simulated in different plug-in hybrid configurations. The software has been validated with real operation data of a euro 6 diesel engine. The general hypothesis underlying the research consists in the possibility of using these vehicles in totally electric mode in the city and in hybrid mode outside urban centers; with the aim of reducing polluting emissions in populated city but completing the delivery mission during all phases of vehicle operation. The PHEV simulations have been performed on both WLTC and RDE condition. In the latter mode, particular attention has been devoted to the interpretation of data from GPS sensor: like the slope of the route or the presence of tunnels. The success of the simulation depends on a correct and careful reconstruction of the GPS data. Three vehicles with different hybridization factors have been simulated: 0.44, 0.56, and 0.67, respectively, with power equal to that of the base vehicle. The battery packs have been sized for the three hybrid vehicles and simulations were carried out in both Charge Depleting and Charge Sustaining configuration. In charge depleting for the highest hybrid configuration (HF=0.66), the results demonstrate that a reduction of up to 80% and 76% in fuel can be saved While a reduction up to 75% and 45% in NOx emissions can be achieved on WLTC and RDE cycle, respectively. On the other hand, when the battery is discharged, for HF=0.67, although consumption can be reduced by up to 45%, NOx emissions also increase by 183% even if ICE operation mode has to be better optimize for hybrid operation. Finally, even if the hybrid solutions is really convenient if compared to the conventional vehicle in terms of fuel savings and NOx pollutant emissions, about a realistic estimation of the CO2 reduction that can be achieved the use of electrical energy must be take into account.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>379 Application of an energy and nutrient matrix to a diet supplemented with a novel phytase achieved a production and sustainability benefit in pigs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skae234.284</link>

                Abstract The capacity of a novel consensus bacterial 6-phytase variant (PhyG) to maintain growth performance and production benefits of pigs when added to an energy and nutrient-reduced mixed cereal diet was assessed. Two experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1 (wean to finish), weaned pigs [n = 192; initial body weight (BW) 7.18 &#177; 0.38 kg] were randomized to 4 treatments from weaning until market weight. Diets were provided in 5 phases. Treatments included: 1) a nutritionally sufficient positive control (PC); 2) a negative control (NC1) without added inorganic phosphate, reduced (based on specific PhyG dose) in net energy (NE), calcium (Ca), digestible amino acids (AA) and sodium (Na) vs. PC, supplemented with PhyG at 1,000, 1,000, 750, 500 and 500 FTU/kg in each phase, respectively (NC1+low PhyG); 3) a negative control (NC2) as NC1 supplemented with PhyG at 2,000, 2,000, 1,000, 750 and 750 FTU/kg in each phase and further reduced in energy and nutrient based on specific PhyG dose (NC2+high PhyG), and; 4) a negative control (NC3) as 2) and supplemented with xylanase&#8211;&#946;-glucanase (XB) to provide 2,400 U/kg xylanase and 304 U/kg &#946;-glucanase, with additional reduction in NE and digestible AA based on the contribution of XB (NC3+low PhyG + XB). In Exp. 2 (nursery), weaned pigs (n = 360; initial BW 8.40 &#177; 0.78 kg) were assigned to 3 dietary treatments from weaning up to 35 d. Diets were offered in 2 phases. Treatments included a nutritionally adequate positive control (PC) and 2 PhyG-supplemented diets, reduced in digestible phosphorus, Ca, Na, NE and digestible AA vs. PC, according to the expected contribution of PhyG added at 1,000 FTU/kg (NC1) or 2,000 FTU/kg (NC2), respectively. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. Means separation was by Tukey&#8217;s HSD test. In Exp. 1, overall growth performance (114 d) in all enzyme-supplemented diets was maintained or improved compared with PC. Compared with PC, feed cost per kg BW gain was significantly reduced by 7.3% and total carbon footprint (CFP; CO2 eq. g/kg BW gain) was reduced by 6.8% with PhyG + XB combination. In Exp.2, overall growth performance (35 d), in all PhyG-supplemented, nutrient-reduced, treatments, were either not different from, or were improved, vs. PC. Total feed costs and estimated CFP per kg BW gain were reduced in all PhyG-supplemented, nutrient- and NE-reduced treatments vs. PC. In conclusion, the application of a full energy and nutrient matrix maintained the overall growth of pigs in both 114- and 35-d studies with the novel phytase. The addition of XB further improved the overall growth of market pigs. Moreover, full matrix application with PhyG achieved reductions in total feed cost and carbon footprint in both studies.</description>

      <title>358 The effect of increasing dietary limestone concentration on growth performance, gas flux, and carcass characteristics in finishing beef cattle</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skae234.427</link>
      <description>Nathan S Long, Jarret A Proctor, Ryan C Foster, Vin&#237;cius N Gouv&#234;a, Matthew R Beck, Jason K. Smith, Journal of Animal Science. 102(Supplement_3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402541624

                Abstract Reducing methane (CH4) emissions from beef cattle is desirable as CH4 is a greenhouse gas that represents an energetic loss from the production system. Limestone is commonly fed to cattle as a source of calcium but may also act as a rumen buffer and decrease CH4 emissions by limiting hydrogen availability for methanogenesis. The objective of this experiment was to determine if diet limestone concentration influences growth performance, gas flux, and carcass characteristics in finishing beef cattle. Yearling steers [n = 16; initial body weight (BW) 619 &#177; 34 kg] were stratified by BW and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 isocaloric and isonitrogenous dietary treatments in a completely randomized design where limestone was included at 1.3% (1X) or 2.6% (2X) of diet dry matter (DM). Finishing diets were formulated to contain 0.43 or 0.96% DM as Ca and were fed ad libitum using automated cattle feeders (SmartFeed Pro; C-Lock Inc.; Rapid City, SD) in a single pen for the final 37 d of finishing. Body weights were measured on d -1, 0, 36, and 37. An automated head chamber system (GreenFeed; C-Lock Inc.) was used to measure gas flux. Analysis of variance was conducted using JMP Pro 17 to determine the fixed effect of treatment with individual animal as the experimental unit. Statistical significance was defined as P &#8804; 0.05 with a tendency defined as 0.05 &amp;lt; P &#8804; 0.10. Increasing the dietary limestone concentration from 1.3 to 2.6% of DM did not influence DM intake, but numerically increased final shrunk BW (P = 0.68) and hot carcass weight (P = 0.75) and increased average daily gain (ADG; P = 0.02) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) by approximately 12%. Cattle fed the 2X diet tended to have 6.5% greater ribeye area (P = 0.09), but similar USDA yield grade, backfat thickness, and dressing percentage (P &#8805; 0.34) when compared with cattle fed the 1X diet. Daily CO2 and CH4 emissions, daily O2 consumption, CH4 yield, and respiratory quotient were unaffected by treatment (P &#8805; 0.47). The improvement in ADG resulted in a tendency for CH4 emission intensity to be decreased by 9.1% (P = 0.09) when the concentration of limestone was 2.6% of dietary DM. While increasing dietary limestone concentration from 1.3 to 2.6% of diet DM did not influence absolute daily CH4 emissions, it increased ADG through an improvement in feed efficiency, which translated to a tendency for a reduction in CH4 emission intensity. These preliminary data suggest that there may be a benefit to feeding limestone or calcium at levels greater than currently recommended by the NASEM (2016). Future research should focus on determining optimum dietary limestone or calcium levels for finishing cattle.</description>
