                The extensive combustion of fossil fuels results in excessive release of carbon dioxide (CO2), causing a global environmental crisis. It is imperative to develop sustainable methods for converting CO2 into renewable energy sources. Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) offers the potential to generate valuable chemicals, including C1 products (e.g., carbon monoxide, methane, etc.) and C2+ products (e.g., ethene, ethanol, acetic acid, propyl alcohol, etc.). Copper&#8208;based (Cu&#8208;based) catalysts show promise for producing value&#8208;added C2+ products, but they face challenges like low selectivity and stability. The catalytic performances of Cu&#8208;based catalysts can be promoted through electronic structure adjustment, selective crystal face exposure, as well as molecular additive approaches. Ionic liquids (ILs), known for their strong CO2 adsorption capacity, adjustable hydrophobicity, and wide chemical window, hold significant promise for addressing the current challenges associated with Cu&#8208;based catalysts. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the structural characterization and catalytic mechanisms of ILs used in Cu&#8208;based CO2RR catalytic systems. Additionally, it offers suggestions for future research avenues regarding IL&#8208;functionalized Cu catalysts.</description>

      <title>Triazolium-Catalyzed Metal-Free Photochemical Reduction of CO2 into Formate</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-p8m06</link>

                The use of renewable solar energy for the photochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has garnered significant interest owing to its dual benefits: reducing the greenhouse effect and producing high-energy alternatives to fossil fuels. Transition metals play a crucial role in catalyzing the CO2RR; however, their scarcity and high cost pose significant challenges in achieving sustainable chemistry. In this study, we developed a metal-free CO2RR catalytic system using triazolium, a small and structurally simple compound, as the key catalyst. Visible-light irradiation of a solution containing a carbazole photosensitizer and triazolium salt under 1 atm pressure of CO2 afforded formate in high yield at room temperature. No other reduced products of CO2 or by-products such as methanol, formaldehyde, oxalate, CO, or H2 were detected. The turnover number of the catalyst exceeded 2300, indicating high catalytic activity and durability. Mechanistic studies revealed that the triazolium salt serves as a hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalyst, with a carbon-centered radical as the catalytically active species. A study on the relationship between the chemical structure and catalytic activity of various triazolium analogs elucidated the essential structural properties required for carbon-centered HAT catalysts. The results of this study provide valuable insights for future research on CO2RR utilizing transition-metal-free organic molecules as catalysts, which could significantly contribute to environmentally friendly and sustainable methods.</description>

      <title>Photothermal Synergistic Effect Induces Bimetallic Cooperation to Modulate Product Selectivity of CO2 Reduction on Different CeO2 Crystal Facets</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202410474</link>

                Product selectivity of solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation reactions has been successfully controlled by tuning the spatial distance between Pt/Au bimetallic active sites on different crystal facets of CeO2 catalysts. The replacement depth of Ce atoms by monatomic Pt determines the distance between bimetallic sites, while Au clusters are deposited on the surface. This space configuration creates a favourable microenvironment for the migration of active hydrogen species (*H). The *H is generated via the activation of H2O on monatomic Pt sites and migrate towards Au clusters with a strong capacity for CO2 adsorption. Under concentrated solar irradiation, selectivity of the (100) facet towards CO is 100%, and the selectivity of the (110) and (111) facets towards CH4 is 33.5% and 97.6%, respectively. Notably, the CH4 yield on the (111) facet is as high as 369.4 &#181;mol/g/h, and the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy efficiency of 0.23% is 33.8 times higher than that under non&#8208;concentrated solar irradiation. The impacts of high&#8208;density flux photon and thermal effects on carriers and *H migration at the microscale are comprehensively discussed. This study provides a new avenue for tuning the spatial distance between active sites to achieve optimal product selectivity.</description>

      <title>WATER SOFTENING PLANTS AND REDUCTION OF IRON AND MANGANESE BY MAGNETIC AND NANOBUBBLE CO2 TREATMENT: A TECHNICAL AND APPLICATIVE ANALYSIS</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.51865/jpgt.2024.01.09</link>
      <description>Dan Ovidiu C&#238;rjan, Maria Stoicescu, Romanian Journal of Petroleum &amp; Gas Technology. 5 (76)(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401333969

                Human society and environment are based on water resources. Hard water with iron and manganese excess is spread across the world and softening of drinking water is widely applied for reasons of public health, client comfort, economic and environmental benefits. Also, from industrial or commercial point of view, using it produce scale deposits in water systems and equipment often result in ample technical and economic problems. Solutions of reducing its hardness and iron/manganese excess exists on the market, even with the substances presented in the work. The novelty this study brings comes from using high intensity permanent magnets arrangements and CO2 nanobubbles treatment that increased the speed, the volume of treatment, while decreasing the energy and complexity of the installation, also decreasing the pollution mark of the system. The detrimental contributions of softening, in particular the use of chemicals and energy, are taken into account in the carbon footprint of the drinking water companies. The beneficial contributions have not been included in the carbon footprint. For carbon capture in the crystallized calcite and dissolution of CO2 into the softened water, the carbon footprint is compensated by the net carbon benefit of softening.</description>

                Converting CO2 to carbon&#8208;based fuels using solar energy via photocatalysis is a promising approach to boost carbon neutrality. However, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency is hampered by interconnected multiple factors including insufficient light absorption, low separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers as well as complex and sluggish surface reaction kinetics. Herein, we incorporate MnO2 nanowires and Co3O4 hollow polyhedrons with abundant oxygen vacancies (Vo) into MnO2/Co3O4 sugar&#8208;gourd nanohybrids for boosting CO2 photoreduction. The MnO2/Co3O4 nanohybrids not only display strong absorption in the visible&#8211;near infrared region, but also facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers in terms of S&#8208;scheme transfer pathway, supplying abundant electrons for CO2 reduction reaction. Furthermore, the presence of VO enhances the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and promotes the chemical adsorption to CO2 molecules. In addition, the interfacial electronic interaction between MnO2 and Co3O4 also contributes to the chemical adsorption and activation to CO2. Owing to the synergy of S&#8208;scheme transfer pathway and VO, the MnO2/Co3O4 hybrids exhibit greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity towards CO2 reduction under the irradiation of visible light in comparison with bare MnO2 and Co3O4, delivering a CO evolution rate of 15.9 umol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a 100% selectivity.</description>

                Global warming that has an impact on climate change is mostly influenced by an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) gas in the air. The Objective of the study is to investigate risk control in the Decarbonization program consisting of Carbon Reduction and Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS). The focus of the study area in this research is the Donggi Matindok gas field in Central Sulawesi. The research method is to conduct a risk analysis of the decarbonization program implemented so that it can mitigate the risk of operation failure and safety. The results of the evaluation obtained that the carbon reduction program that has been carried out consists of gas processing innovations, energy efficiency, flaring reduction has a low risk with a reduction of 22% per year from the total CO2 produced. The application of the energy management system or ISO 50001 supports in maintaining energy performance so that energy efficiency can be achieved so that the carbon reduction program can be developed every period. Then for the implementation of the CCUS program has a medium to high risk with significant CO2 reduction potential, which later in this research will review the risk mitigation that needs to be prepared for project completion. CCUS programs that will be carried out are CCU Microalgae and CCS well Injection programs. Well targeted risk mitigation can help ensure that government efforts to support decarbonization programs are effective and successful in the long term.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study on the Impacts of CO2 and H2 Storage on Well Cement Integrity</title>

                Abstract The interactions between hydrogen and carbon dioxide (CO2) with wellbore cement are not fully understood, raising concerns about cement degradation during carbon capture and storage (CCS) and underground hydrogen storage (UHS). This study examines the geochemical, petrophysical, and geomechanical properties of cement before and after exposure to hydrogen and CO2. Cement samples were saturated in brine of 30000 ppm and exposed to the gases at 500 psi and 50&#176;C for 30 days. Hydrogen exposure led to a 50% increase in brownmillerite, a 70% decrease in ettringite, and a reduction in porosity and permeability by 2% and 40%. Compressive strength and Young's modulus increased by 35% and 6%. CO2 exposure caused the formation of calcite (8.7% of the composition) and complete alite depletion, reducing porosity and permeability by 98% and 87%. Compressive strength and Young's modulus rose by 126% and 161%. This study is the first to comprehensively compare cement properties before and after hydrogen and CO2 exposure under the same conditions. The findings suggest hydrogen and CO2 do not weaken cement strength and can even heal fractures, reducing fluid losses.</description>

      <title>Framework for Carbon-Capture and Storage (CCS) in Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/221616-ms</link>
      <description>Akihiro Ibe, Adaobi Stephenie Nwosi-Anele, SPE Nigeria Annual International Conference and Exhibition. 143(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401349299

                Abstract Associated Carbon dioxide (CO2) gas flaring in Nigeria is but only a fraction of the amount of CO2 being released into the atmosphere daily. An increase in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere has led to an increase in greenhouse gas effects. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is one of several solutions proposed to help combat the ever-continuous increase of greenhouse gases in our environment. However, it has been noted by several research papers that for CCS to affect the greenhouse gas effect, the source of the CO2 gas for the carbon capture and storage (sequestration) must be obtained from anthropogenic means. While most other nations haven't only begun this process but also have already established a solid legal framework and regulations for CCS, Nigeria currently has no legal framework for the regulation of CCS. This paper focuses on establishing a framework for CCS to be adapted in Nigeria as a measure to take the first step in the process of establishing a carbon capture and storage process in Nigeria. This process was done by analyzing other legal frameworks that have already been established and then taking into account the diversity and political nature of the Nigerian structure, censoring, and editing these regulations as seen fit, to make a legal framework that is suitable and acceptable to and for Nigerians. In the process of analysis, several key factors such as transportation (across borders and intra-trade), leakages, faults, levies, and taxes as well as tax reduction incentives for companies willing to use CCS were taken into consideration and then explored to find a common ground for both companies and government. The main objective of this work is to urge the Nigerian government and the petroleum industry of the need for the immediate reduction of greenhouse gasses and their effects and the first step begins with laying down the groundwork. The study concludes that adopting a robust legal framework tailored to Nigeria's unique socio-political environment is essential. It also recommends specific legislative actions and incentives to foster CCS adoption, emphasizing the importance of collaboration between government and industry stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Automation of Greenhouse Gas Emission Estimates Associated with Natural Gas Production in the Appalachian Basin</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/221400-ms</link>
      <description>Carlos Calad, T. Buckinham, Edwin Lee Mulligan, M. Annab, Pallav Sarma, Dayanara Betancourt, Carlo V. Caballero&#8208;Uribe, H. Solano, Javad Rafiee, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401349617

                Abstract This study seeks to improve the quantification of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from unconventional natural gas production in the Appalachian Basin, covering Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), and Nitrous Oxide (N2O). The goal is to automate the calculation process for compliance with the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), corporate sustainability reporting, and internal monitoring for emissions reduction targets. Traditionally, GHG emissions are manually computed once a year and are often calculated by third-party consultants, reducing transparency in calculation approaches. The development of an on-demand GHG emissions inventory enables real-time identification of emission-intensive processes, guiding strategic decisions for emissions mitigation and methane intensity reductions. In this project, we employed Python and SQL scripts to map activity data related to process and fugitive emissions, including pneumatic devices, drilling and completions combustion, equipment leaks, liquids unloading, dehydrators, and flaring, into US EPA Subpart W formulas. The result is an annualized carbon footprint calculated at the well pad level, providing comprehensive insights into component gasses (CO2, CH4, and N2O), production-based carbon and methane intensities, and emissions contributions by emission source. Automation improved the efficiency and accuracy of the emissions calculation workflow, generating an updated carbon footprint in a runtime under 5 minutes. Additionally, the inclusion of emissions-generating events overlooked due to human error substantially improved the quality of the emissions footprint. Lastly, the employment of data analytics on all calculation inputs and outputs aided in identifying outliers that required modification. The GHG calculation tool enhances accuracy, transparency, and consistency while minimizing the time invested in GHG estimations, allowing teams to redirect their efforts toward value-added activities. Next steps in the project include detailed emissions forecasting, which facilitates determining the most cost-effective emissions reduction strategy. The mapping of activity data into GHG estimation models was completed within six weeks, with additional time spent in result validation against previous manual calculations. After an initial configuration, data mappings do not require ongoing updates, establishing a fully automated GHG calculation process. This advancement enables efficiency and reliability in monitoring and reporting GHG emissions. Additionally, the development of a granular carbon footprint on an emission source basis enables detailed, source-level emissions forecasting to support future decisions around emission reduction projects.</description>

                The electroreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2RR) is one of the most promising ways to valorise CO2 as a source of carbon. The development of novel, efficient and scalable catalysts for CO2 electroreduction within electrolysers is still a big challenge. Here, we report the preparation of sustainable, efficient and stable gas diffusion electrodes utilizing Ag as catalyst for the CO2 electroreduction to CO. These cathodic materials are prepared by sputter deposition and subjected to post-deposition modification using dry, reactive processes. The catalyst is uniformly deposited as a thin layer on the porous structure of PTFE minimizing the amount of Ag required. This approach allows for fine tuning of the morphology, chemical composition and loading of Ag and their impact on the CO2RR. These electrodes have been evaluated for the CO2 electroreduction and for electrocatalytic studies in a flow reactor with gas-fed CO2. The optimized electrodes show high activity, with current densities &gt; 20 mA/cm2 at -1,18 V vs. RHE, and faradaic efficiency for CO &gt; 90 %. The stability was tested over periods up to 24 hours showing a significant impact of the post-deposition modification. Higher porosity, roughness and electrochemical surface area have been achieved after the modification. Noteworthy, our approach allows for outstanding performances using a minimal amount of metal, while using the processing advantages of sputtering as an industrial state-of-the-art, high-throughput, and roll-to-roll compatible technique. Moreover, this route enables the deposition of different metals and alloys of tailored composition for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction beyond CO.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the Mineral Manganese OXMN009 and OXMN009P in the Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) Process Using Thermogravimetry</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app14156823</link>
      <description>Sandra Pe&#241;a Murillo, Carmen R. Forero, Francisco Velasco-Sarria, Eduardo Arango, Applied Sciences. 14(15)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401321925

                Indirect combustion with the chemical looping combustion (CLC) of solid oxygen carriers is one of the most promising technologies for capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) in energy production from fossil fuels since the separation of the generated CO2 is inherent to the process itself. Therefore, the cost associated with capturing this gas will be significantly reduced. This technology transfers oxygen from air to fuel through a metal oxide that acts as an oxygen carrier, avoiding direct contact between air and fuel. This oxygen carrier circulates in a fluidized bed reactor called a reduction reactor and an oxidation reactor. (1) This research work has focused on evaluating the behavior of oxygen carriers based on the original and improved manganese mineral (copper-impregnated mineral) named for this study, OXMN009 and OXMN009P, respectively. (2) Equilibrium experiments were carried out on a thermogravimetric balance (TGA) to evaluate the kinetic behavior of these oxygen transporters OXMN009 and OXMN009P, using the gases methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen (H2). (3) The enhanced solid oxygen carrier OXMN009P exhibited good performance for the CLC process with gaseous fuels in terms of reactivity and combustion efficiency, having high reactivity and oxygen transfer properties due to copper impregnation. (4) The results show that OXMN009P has comparable reactivity to other manganese-based materials reported in the literature. It may be an effective option for carbon dioxide capture, as it uses metal oxides as the oxygen transporters (TO). (5) These oxygen transporters, OXMN009 and OXMN009P, are used in a cyclic process that prevents the formation of nitrogen oxides by keeping the air and fuel separate. (6) Thermogravimetric balance (TGA) experiments were conducted to evaluate the kinetic behavior of these copper-modified oxygen transporters. (7) It was found that OXMN009P improved the reactivity and oxygen transfer properties due to copper impregnation. The kinetic parameters obtained in the TGA indicate that the reaction is non-thermal and requires less energy to initiate. (8) The results show that OXMN009P has reactivity comparable to other manganese-based materials reported in the literature and can be an effective option for carbon dioxide capture.</description>

      <title>Cost-Benefit Analysis of a Policy that will Limit Carbon Dioxide Emissions of DieselPowered Generator.</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.56293/ijasr.2022.5543</link>
      <description>Toyin Amunigun, International Journal of Applied Science and Research. 06(04)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4401297225

                This paper presents a detailed economic analysis of a proposed regulation to limit carbon dioxide emissions from diesel generators in the United States. The analysis is conducted through a cost-benefit framework, with the objective of determining whether the societal benefits of reduced carbon dioxide emissions would outweigh the economic costs of the regulation. The study draws from previous research on the application of costbenefit analysis in the context of environmental policy, particularly climate change. It then estimates the potential benefits from avoided carbon dioxide emissions, and contrasts these with the costs that could arise from implementing carbon capture technologies, a reduction in the diesel generator sector's value, and a drop in diesel fuel demand. The results suggest that the economic costs of the proposed regulation outweigh the benefits, both in the short term and the long run. However, the paper concludes with a call for continued efforts in finding economically and environmentally balanced solutions to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in sectors with significant contributions like the electric power sector.</description>

                This literary review examines the work of a distinguished research team from the University of Berkeley and the University of Toronto. The work in question was a key paper in the global search within the scientific community to find a solution to the excess of fossil fuels within the atmosphere. Specifically, this research team&#8217;s focus was the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to hydrogen gas and carbon monoxide. This review offers a fundamental standpoint, honing in on a specific technique that is cutting-edge in terms of technology, research, and methodology, while also being broadly applicable. The technique includes the use of a gold (Au) electrode precisely coated with a copper (Cu) monolayer, which (altogether) serves as the electrocatalyst powering the reaction. Techniques like Raman spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry, coupled with concepts such as Molecular Orbital Theory, helped to explain the inner workings of the carbon dioxide reduction reaction. This study demonstrated that changing the amount of Cu deposited onto a Au surface affected the produced hydrogen gas (H2) to carbon monoxide (CO) ratio. This review also considered the appropriateness of Raman spectroscopy, and whether or not it was the best technical choice given the context of this experiment. Altogether, this review uses fundamental concepts in chemistry to analyze a new method of reducing carbon dioxide, an electrochemical process that is growing increasingly relevant in today&#8217;s efforts to reduce fossil fuel emissions.</description>

      <title>Crude Oil Bulk Flow Strategy to Manage Emission Abatement and Gas Flaring &#8211; An Adafill Eastern Asset Success Story</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/221710-ms</link>
      <description>Bayo Balogun, Idarasit Adigu, O.A. Adeleke, Oghenevwogaga Bosini, Emmanuel Wordu, Gloria Siwe Usiagu, Chinedu Onyeme, Victor Okahia Ewuzie, SPE Nigeria Annual International Conference and Exhibition. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401349013

                Abstract Greenhouse gas emissions primarily result from releasing various gases into the Earth's atmosphere during oil and gas extraction, production, and distribution. These emissions significantly contribute to global warming and climate change. The main greenhouse gases emitted by this sector include carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These gases are released through leaks, venting, incomplete combustion, intentional releases, and notably, gas flaring from facilities lacking Associated Gas Gathering (AGG) solutions. Given the significant contribution of the oil and gas industry to greenhouse gas emissions, it is crucial to identify and implement effective management and reduction techniques. This paper focuses on identifying specific abatement technique tailored for the oil and gas sector, evaluating their effectiveness and feasibility, and identifying potential challenges in implementing them to combat climate change and ensure a sustainable future. The ADAFILL Eastern Asset is a pseudo-name for an existing major operator of a joint venture in Nigeria and has implemented bulk flow management strategies in the context of crude oil extraction and processing to manage and reduce emissions and gas flaring. This paper provides an overview of the assets, examining their current infrastructure, processes, and environmental performance. It also delves into the implementation of emission abatement measures, evaluates their results and impact, and provides recommendations for further improvements. This paper highlights the importance of addressing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing flare gas in the oil and gas industries. It presents the crude oil bulk flow approach as a proven solution, which effectively captures, recovers, and utilizes gases that would otherwise be flared or vented into the atmosphere. By implementing bulk flow systems, the Eastern Asset of ADAFILL has significantly reduced its environmental impact, conserved resources, and contributed to a more sustainable future by adopting this low-cost solution for facilities without Associated Gas Gathering infrastructure.</description>

                This chapter examines energy and infrastructure in the context of climate change. It notes that infrastructure is closely associated with energy production and use. The practical application of alternative energy sources relies on investigations undertaken at the local and regional scales. The chapter considers how transferring from the use of fossil fuels to renewable forms of energy can contribute to reduction of the enhanced greenhouse effect by reducing carbon dioxide emissions. It introduces hydropower, wind power, and solar power as renewable energy sources. Finally, the chapter shows that climate change is altering both supply capacity and energy demand and infrastructure use.</description>

                Abstract Alga 1.0, a product containing bromoform, was fed to cattle to evaluate effects on methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and diet digestibility. Twelve non-lactating, non-pregnant Jersey cows (490 &#177; 19 kg BW) were used in four replicated 3&#215;3 Latin squares with three periods, each consisting of 21 d. Cows were blocked by feed intake (averaged intakes over four weeks prior to trial) and assigned randomly to one of three treatments. Treatments included Alga 1.0 fed at 0, 69, and 103 g/d in a 0.454 kg/d DM top dress daily in a modified distillers grains plus solubles (MDGS) carrier. Diet consisted of 60% dry-rolled corn, 20% corn silage, 15% modified distillers grains, and 5% supplement (DM basis). Headbox-style indirect calorimeters were utilized to evaluate gas production from individual cows with two non-consecutive 23-h collections in each period. Data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS with cow within square as experimental unit and as a random effect, and treatment and period as fixed effects. Linear and quadratic contrasts were used to compare treatments. Feeding Alga 1.0 linearly reduced dry matter intake (DMI, P &amp;lt; 0.01) by 10.1 % for 69 g/d inclusion and 13.3 % for 103 g/d inclusion compared to the control. Nutrient intakes decreased linearly (P &amp;lt; 0.01) due to lower DMI, but nutrient digestibility was not impacted (P &#8805; 0.28). Inclusion of Alga 1.0 did not impact gross energy or digestible energy concentration of the diets expressed as Mcal/kg DM (P &#8805; 0.22) but did linearly reduce energy intake (Mcal/d; P &amp;lt; 0.01). Feeding Alga 1.0 linearly reduced enteric CH4 emissions measured as g/kg DMI (P &amp;lt; 0.01) by 39 and 64% for 69 g/d and 103 g/d inclusion, respectively. Linear reductions (P &amp;lt; 0.01) of 64 to 65% were also observed in enteric CH4 emissions when expressed per kg of DM or organic matter digested. Respired CO2 as g/d linearly decreased (P = 0.03) for cattle fed Alga 1.0 but did not differ when expressed as g/kg of DMI (P &#8805; 0.23). Oxygen consumption (O2) did not differ between treatments for g/d and g/kg DMI (P &#8805; 0.19). In conclusion, feeding Alga 1.0 reduced DMI up to 13.3 %, did not impact digestibility, and significantly reduced CH4 emissions up to 63%.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of low temperature combustion in a diesel engine depending on injection advance and injection pressure</title>

                In this study, the performance parameters and emissions of a pre-mixed charge compression ignition were investigated under different injection pressures and injection advances. After the peak engine power was reached, reasonable decreases occurred in brake mean effective pressure at certain injection advances with the increase of injection advance, and dramatic decreases observed when interval was so exceeded. In addition to mean indicated pressure and peak in-cylinder pressure were investigated. Considering the emissions, dramatic increases were observed in carbon monoxide and total hydrocarbon, depending on the increase in the LTC regime. Nitrogen oxides started a rapid downward trend after a certain injection advance value in the experimental region, but this effect didn?t occur at the desired level for specific nitrogen oxides. It was observed that the nitrogen dioxide to nitrogen oxides ratio increased as the pre-mixed charge compression ignition became dominant and nitrogen dioxide production increased among the total nitrogen oxides. In the operating region where the LTC regime was dominant, the targeted reduction in NOx and PM emissions was observed, but the desired reduction in specific emissions did not occur. In the LTC region, the combustion process was prolonged, initially reasonable changes occurred at performance parameters, but unacceptable results were observed at high injection pressures with excessive injection advances.</description>

      <title>Quantile lens on carbon footprints: Renewable energy, tourism, financial development, and the pursuit of Sustainable Development Goals 2030</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54055/ejtr.v38i.3550</link>
      <description>Saqib Mehmood, Rudsada Kaewsaeng&#8208;on, European Journal of Tourism Research. 38(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401226817

                The pursuit of sustainable development goals (SDGs) by 2030 has become a global imperative, necessitating a comprehensive examination of factors influencing carbon footprints across various sectors. In light of varying levels of sensitivity among the top five tourist countries&#8212;France, Spain, the United States, Turkey, and Italy&#8212;to renewable energy, tourism, financial development, and sustainable development goals (SDGs), this study addresses the challenge of effectively harnessing these factors to achieve comprehensive carbon emissions reduction and sustainable development objectives. By taking data from 1997 to 2021, novel panel quantile regression analysis is performed to ascertain the long-run impacts in lower, middle, and upper quantiles. It finds that renewable energy investments and eco-friendly tourism practices, supported by financial development initiatives, can substantially reduce carbon dioxide emissions in top tourist destinations. These measures are essential for maintaining the concerns of the economy and environmental preservation. Renewable energy and financial development unequivocally lead to decreased carbon emissions in the middle and higher quantiles. Tourism development leads to an escalation in carbon emissions approximately in all the quantiles, i.e., from 0.10 to 0.90. The findings of this study underscore that it is crucial to implement specific measures to encourage the use of renewable energy, environmentally friendly practices in tourism, and sustainable financial initiatives. It will not only effectively reduce carbon emissions in top tourist destinations, but also make progress towards achieving sustainable development goals by 2030.</description>

      <title>Institutional Performance and Carbon Reduction Effect of High-Quality Development of New Energy: China&#8217;s Experience and Policy Implication</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16166734</link>

                Based on the policy text from 1999 to 2022, this paper quantitatively analyzes photovoltaic power, wind power and new energy policies in mainland China by keyword capture and policy strength and establishes a spatial Durbin model to study the carbon reduction effects. The results show the following: (1) The development of new energy is primarily project-based and concentrated in rural areas. (2) Financial support is a double-edged sword. (3) After the implementation of the Renewable Energy Law in 2015, the change trend in policy quantity, total policy intensity, and average policy intensity is generally consistent. (4) The increase in the strength of new energy policies has effectively reduced the intensity of provincial carbon dioxide emissions. (5) New energy policies introduced in a single region are less effective in reducing carbon emissions than joint regional regulation. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the quality and coordination of new energy policies through the effective convergence of policies and regular evaluations to enhance the positive guidance of the policies. Policy measures for new energy are refined in three areas: improving the amount and quality of new energy policies, strengthening new energy policies and establishing cooperation mechanisms for the cross-regional consumption of new energy.</description>

                In 2002, the German agricultural sector contributed 8.7 % of the total national green house gas emissions. The main sources were animal digestion, manure management and agricultural soils. From the technical point of view, the manure management has the biggest potential of green house gas reduction by using biogas technology. Thereby methane emission from manure, which otherwise had been emitted into the atmosphere, can be recaptured and used to substitute fossil fuels. Regarding the whole output of manure from cattle and swine in Germany, the emission reduction is 56 Mio. t CO2-equivalent. This amount is equivalent to 4.5% of the emissions in 1990/95 for the Kyoto protocol. Regarding the biomass potential which is technically feasible at the moment, the reduction potential growth to 276 Mio. t CO2-equivalent or 22% of emissions. This is 27.5 times more than the reduction commitment of the German industry for EU-emissions trading in the period from 2005-2012.</description>

                The reduction of CO2 to C2+ products using photoelectrochemistry (PEC) is significant and highly challenging. However, systematic summaries on PEC CO2 conversion into C2+ products are lacking. Therefore, this paper systematically reviews the current research status of the PEC CO2 conversion for the preparation of C2+ products, including the pathways of C2+ products, the usage of catalysts and reactors, and methods for improving C2+ product selectivity. Besides, the deficiencies in current research are analyzed, and future developments are discussed.</description>

                Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into C2 products of high economic value provides a promising strategy to realize resourceful CO2 utilization. Rational design and construct dual sites to realize the CO protonation and C-C coupling to unravel their structure-performance correlation is of great significance in catalysing electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions. Herein, Cu-Cu dual sites with different site distance coordinated by halogen at the first-shell are constructed and shows a higher intramolecular electron redispersion and coordination symmetry configurations. The long-range Cu-Cu (Cu-I-Cu) dual sites show an enhanced Faraday efficiency of C2 products, up to 74.1%, and excellent stability. In addition, the linear relationships that the long-range Cu-Cu dual site is accelerated to C2H4 generation and short-range Cu-Cu (Cu-Cl-Cu) dual site is beneficial for C2H5OH formation are disclosed. In situ electrochemical attenuated total reflection surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and theoretical calculations manifest that long-range Cu-Cu dual sites can weaken reaction energy barriers of CO hydrogenation and C-C coupling, as well as accelerating deoxygenation of *CH2CHO. This study uncovers the exploitation of site-distance-dependent electrochemical property to steer the CO2 reduction pathway, as well as a potential generic tactic to target C2 synthesis by constructing the desired Cu-Cu dual sites.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of direct solid-gas carbonation and direct aqueous carbonation for carbon capture and storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2798/1/012006</link>
      <description>Jianguo Wang, Journal of Physics Conference Series. 2798(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401344650

                Abstract Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is a significant contributor to global warming and environmental issues, necessitating the development of practical storage solutions. As an alternative to CO 2 storage in subsurface formations, mineral carbonation, which offers long-term CO 2 storage and advantages like thermodynamics and energy economy, is gaining popularity. Also, the possible repurposing of carbonated solid waste in the building and construction industry contributes to the reduction of CO 2 . However, large-scale implementation of natural mineral carbonation remains a challenge. This study investigates the comparative advantages and disadvantages of direct solid-gas and direct aqueous carbonation, two carbon capture and storage (CCS) methods for combating atmospheric CO 2 emissions. The research focuses on reaction kinetics, capture efficiency, recovery efficiency, leakage security, and cost-effectiveness. Both methods have the potential to capture CO 2 efficiently, but they differ in their effectiveness and feasibility. Direct solid-gas carbonation exhibits higher reaction rates and capture efficiency, while direct aqueous carbonation has lower energy requirements and is easier to implement at ambient temperature and pressure. Further research is essential to fully understand the comparative merits and drawbacks of direct solid-gas and aqueous carbonation and devise strategies to minimize their environmental impact. Furthermore, to ensure economic feasibility, future research should focus on lowering CO 2 sequestration costs, increasing the scale of captured CO 2 usage in industrial processes, and developing a circular economy by transforming captured CO 2 into valuable metal carbonates.</description>

                Objective: To address these issues, we propose the use of ionic polymer membranes. By reducing the demand for synthetic plastics, these membranes contribute to pollution reduction. Moreover, they offer economic and environmental benefits. Ionic polymers can also help limit carbon dioxide emissions. Method: In our study, we created a blend of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and polyvinyl sulfonic acid (PVSA). This blend was used to fabricate an ionic membrane through the solvent casting method. The resulting membrane acts as a successful dielectric material, sandwiched between copper electrodes. We conducted extensive characterization, including microstructure analysis, crystal structure examination, identification of functional groups, and thermal behavior assessment. Results: Our findings demonstrate the potential of ionic polymer membranes for capacitor applications. By varying the composition of PVDF/PVP/PVSA, we explored different dielectric properties. Notably, the ionic polymer electrolyte can serve as an effective dielectric material, with copper electrodes providing a practical application. Conclusion: Our investigation included electrical current density measurements using cyclic voltammetry, elemental composition analysis, morphological studies, and material composition assessments.</description>

                Abstract Methane, with a global warming potential roughly 86 times greater than carbon dioxide over a 20&#8208;year timeframe, plays a crucial role in global warming. Remote sensing retrieval is a pivotal methodology for identifying methane emission sources, with accuracy influenced largely by surface and atmospheric properties, including aerosols. In this study, we propose an Aerosol&#8208;Calibrated Matched Filter (ACMF) algorithm to improve the traditional Matched Filter (MF) method. Our new approach incorporates an aerosol scattering correction factor to reduce the aerosol&#8208;induced bias on methane retrievals. Validating our algorithm through simulated spectra, we demonstrate that considering the aerosol scattering effect significantly reduces retrieval errors compared to MF methods by an average of approximately 90%. We apply our newly developed algorithm to hyperspectral data obtained from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer&#8212;Next Generation in the Los Angeles Basin and focus on 11 plumes identified through case studies. Our results reveal that ACMF estimates of emission rates and inversion uncertainties exhibit an average reduction of approximately 4% compared to corresponding MF results, with deviation increasing with aerosol optical depth (AOD).</description>

                Abstract The increasing impact of industrialization on climate change, primarily due to the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), underscores the urgent need for effective strategies for CO 2 fixation and utilization. Electrochemical CO 2 reduction holds promise in this regard, owing to its scalability, energy efficiency, selectivity, and operability under ambient conditions. However, the activation of CO 2 requires suitable electrocatalysts to lower energy barriers. Various electrocatalysts, including metal&#8208;based systems and conducting polymers like polyaniline (PANi), have been identified to effectively lower this barrier and enhance CO 2 reduction efficiency via synergistic mechanisms. PANi is particularly notable for its versatile interaction with CO 2 , cost&#8208;effectiveness, stability, and tunable properties, making it an excellent catalyst option for CO 2 reduction reactions (CO 2 RR). Recent advancements in research focus on enhancing PANi conductivity and facilitating electron transfer through metal and metal oxide doping. Leveraging PANi's &#960;&#8211;&#960; electron stabilization ensures high conductivity and stability, rendering it suitable for real&#8208;time applications. Strategic dopant selection and optimization of Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions are crucial for selective CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbon conversion. Tailored electrode modifications, especially metal/metal oxide&#8208;loaded PANi electrodes, outperform conventional approaches, underscoring the importance of catalyst design in advancing CO 2 electroreduction technologies. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the systematic methodology involved in preparing PANi&#8208;modified electrodes and explores the enhancements achieved through the incorporation of metals and metal oxides onto PANi&#8208;modified electrodes. It highlights the superior efficiency and selectivity of CO 2 RR facilitated by these modified electrodes through profound synergistic approach compared to conventional metal electrodes such as platinum.</description>

                In developing cities, transport activities have become one of the primary sources of CO2 emissions and energy consumption owing to rapid economic growth, urbanization, and motorization. Khon Kaen City, Thailand, was chosen as a representative mid-sized city of a developing country to investigate the potential influences of transit-oriented development (TOD), light rail transit (LRT), and electric vehicle (EV) policy integration scenarios on CO2 emission and energy consumption reductions in 2016, 2026, and 2046. The TOD did not significantly reduce CO2 emissions or energy consumption because it was only applied in one area of the city. The LRT development also had a small effect because of the small proportion of modal shifts to LRT. However, EV utilization offered the greatest potential for reducing both CO2 emissions and energy consumption. In addition, the integrated scenario combining the three policies had a promising effect, diminishing both CO2 emissions and energy consumption, because it gathered the potential merits and benefits of each individual policy.</description>

      <title>Selection of sheep skin bacteria to reduce blood feeding by biting midges under laboratory conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/eea.13503</link>

                Abstract Biting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are of huge veterinary importance, mainly as vectors of pathogens, such as Bluetongue virus . Currently, there are no effective methods to protect animals against biting midges, as insecticides have limited or short&#8208;lived efficacy. Biting midges are attracted to hosts by carbon dioxide and by their body odours, which are mainly produced by skin bacteria. In humans, it has been shown that differences between individuals in attractiveness to mosquitoes is mediated by these skin bacterial volatiles. This opens the possibility to protect individuals from biting insects by supplementing their skin microbiome with probiotics. In this study, we investigated this approach by culturing sheep skin bacteria on various media and assessing their effects against field&#8208;caught Culicoides (overwhelmingly Obsoletus group species) as well as laboratory&#8208;reared Culicoides nubeculosus (Meigen). Aerococcus urinaeequi , Bacillus safensis , Bacillus subtilis , Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus , Micrococcus sp. and Staphylococcus equorum were selected to be tested in a dual&#8208;choice Y&#8208;tube olfactometer, assessing their behavioural effects on biting midges. We revealed an avoidance effect on laboratory&#8208;reared C. nubeculosus when testing B. safensis and B. subtilis . Bacillus safensis and Micrococcus sp. yielded significant repellent potential towards field&#8208;caught Culicoides . These two candidates were subsequently tested in a membrane blood&#8208;feeding assay. When the bacterial species B. safensis was applied to the membrane, a feeding reduction of 83% was observed with field&#8208;caught Culicoides .</description>

                Molecular catalysts offer a unique opportunity to implement different chemical functionalities to steer the efficiency and selectivity for the CO2 reduction for instance. Metalloporphyrins and metallophthalocyanines are under high scrutiny since their most classic derivatives the tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and parent phthalocyanine (Pc), have been used as the molecular platform to install, hydrogen bonds donnors, proton relays, cationic fragments, incorporation in MOFs and COFs, to enhance the catalytic power of these catalysts. Herein, we examine the electrocatalytic properties of the tetramethyl cobalt (II) tetrapyridinoporphyrazine (CoTmTPyPz) for the reduction of CO2 in heterogeneous medium when adsorbed on carbon nanotubes (CNT) at a carbon paper (CP) electrode. Unlike reported electrocatalysis with cobalt based phthalocyanine where CO was advocated as the two electron and two protons reduced intermediate on the way to the formation of methanol, we found here that CoTmTPyPz does not reduce CO to methanol. Henceforth, ruling out a mechanistic pathway where CO is a reaction intermediate.</description>

      <title>Integrated processes (HPSE+scCO2) to prepare sterilized alginate-gelatine-based aerogel</title>

                Biopolymers application in biomedical areas has been limited due to the physicochemical degradation that occurs using conventional processing/sterilization methods (e.g., steam heat, &#947;-radiation, ethylene oxide). Aiming to avoid/minimize degradation and preserve their properties, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) has been proposed as an alternative sterilization method for such materials. ScCO2 can simultaneously be used as a drying method to produce aerogels (i) and sterilize them (ii). However, a solvent exchange is required to prepare the alcogel from hydrogel, achievable through high-pressure solvent exchange (HPSE) (iii). This study integrated three processes: HPSE, scCO2 drying, and sterilization to prepare alginate-gelatine sterilized aerogels. Two scCO2 sterilization methods were tested. Results showed that sterilization did not compromise the aerogels' chemical, thermal and swelling properties. Conversely, Young's Modulus increased, and BET surface area decreased, due to the structural changes caused by the fast pressurization/depressurization rates applied during sterilization. Regarding the sterilization efficiency, results showed a reduction in contamination throughout the process, achieving a SAL of 10-4. The sterilized aerogels were non-cytotoxic in vitro and showed improved wound-healing properties. The innovative integrated process produced decontaminated/sterile and ready-to-use aerogels reducing process time by 75 %, from 2 days up to 12 h without compromising the aerogel's properties.</description>

                Light Amplified Stimulated Emission of Radiation (LASER) is nowadays widely studied regarding their use in endodontics and restorative dentistry. Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate the antibacterial activity of three types of LASERs namely CO2 LASER.Er, Cr:YSGG LASER and Diode LASER in disinfection of root canals. 70 patients (105 single rooted teeth) were included in the study. There was application of 2% Sodium Hypochlorite (NaOCl), 2780 nm Er,Cr:YSGG LASER, 900 nm Diode LASER and CO2 LASER. Microbial samples were collected from root canals both before and after the interventions through paper points. These parameters were evaluated in microbiology laboratory to obtain Log10 Colony Forming Units (CFUs). There was significant reduction in CFUs of microorganisms inside root canal in all three LASERs evaluated and NaOCl. The reduction in CFUs in LASERs was comparable to NaOCl. Then secondly we applied each LASER in combination with NaOCl. It was observed that reduction in CFU was greater when combination of LASER with NaOCl was applied as compared when applied alone. It can be inferred that LASER when applied with NaOCl can have significant role in disinfection of root canals.</description>

                We developed a tandem, unassisted, solar-driven electrochemical and photothermocatalytic process for the single-pass conversion of CO2 to butene using only simulated solar irradiation as the energetic input. The two-step process involves electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to ethylene followed by ethylene dimerization to butene. We assessed two unassisted electrochemical setups to concentrate ethylene in the CO2R reactor, achieving concentrations up to 5.4 vol.% with 1.8% average solar-to-ethylene conversion and 5.6% average CO2-to-ethylene single-pass conversion under 1-sun illumination. When passed through the photothermocatalytic ethylene oligomerization reactor, we generated 600 ppm of butene under 3-sun illumination. Through analysis of this process, we identified that the presence of H2, CO, and H2O leads to rapid deactivation of the Ni-based ethylene oligomerization catalyst.</description>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) is a promising strategy for converting CO2 into high-value chemical products. However, the synthesis of effective and stable electrocatalysts capable of transforming CO2 into a specified product remains a huge challenge. Herein, we report a template-regulated strategy for the preparation of a Bi2O3-derived nanosheet catalyst with abundant porosity to achieve the expectantly efficient CO2-to-formate conversion. The resultant porous bismuth nanosheet (p-Bi) not only exhibited marked Faradaic efficiency of formate (FEformate), beyond 91% in a broad potential range from &#8722;0.75 to &#8722;1.1 V in the H-type cell, but also demonstrated an appreciable FEformate of 94% at a high current density of 262 mA cm&#8211;2 in the commercially important gas diffusion cell. State-of-the-art X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) and theoretical calculation unraveled the distinct formate production performance of the p-Bi catalyst, which was cocontributed by its smaller size, plentiful porous structure, and stronger Bi&#8211;O bond, thus accelerating the absorption of CO2 and promoting the subsequent formation of intermediates. This work provides an avenue to fabricate bismuth-based catalysts with high planar and porous morphologies for a broad portfolio of applications.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Calibration and CO2 Plume Tracking at the Illinois Basin Decatur Project: A Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Data Assimilation Approach</title>

                Abstract Addressing climate change through carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies necessitates advanced computational methodologies for subsurface CO2 storage monitoring. This study focuses on the Illinois Basin Decatur Project (IBDP), a CCS demonstration pilot aimed at CO2 injection into a deep saline reservoir. We introduce a novel framework combining Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a data-driven model reduction technique, with direct data assimilation to streamline the calibration of CO2 plume evolution models. This approach enhances rapid tracking and overcomes the computational challenges of traditional high-fidelity numerical reservoir simulations known as the full-order model (FOM). Using DMD, we analyzed five distinct FOM simulation cases of the IBDP with varied permeability in the Mt. Simon section to develop reduced-order models (ROMs). These ROMs utilize three state variables: reservoir pressure, CO2 plume saturation, and bottom-hole pressure (BHP) from a CO2 injection well alongside multi-level pressures from a monitoring well derived from the FOM and the actual field data respectively. Initial FOM simulation cases assessed the impact of permeability multipliers on pressure responses. We then transformed these into ROMs using DMD, preserving essential dynamics. Linear interpolation between permeabilities and DMD outputs&#8212;modes and eigenvalues&#8212;established relationships for rapid BHP prediction under different scenarios. Employing a Kalman filter, we optimized a global permeability multiplier, using the ROMs, to align measured and simulated BHP values, ensuring model calibration. The final calibrated FOM was further decomposed to a DMD-based ROM, enabling quick, accurate predictions, significantly reducing computational time from hours to minutes. Utilizing an ROM derived through DMD, we achieved an order of 160 reduction in computational time (from 8 hours to just 3 minutes) for a 3-year historical CO2 injection period modeled with 547,000 cells of the FOM. The ROM demonstrated remarkable fidelity, with a mean absolute error of 1.46 psi for pressure and 3.7e-05 for CO2 plume saturation, effectively capturing the dynamics of the full-order model. This substantial decrease in computational time illustrates an advantageous trade-off between speed and accuracy, optimizing the potential for long-term forecasting and monitoring of CO2 sequestration. Incorporating the IBDP as a case study, this research contributes a significant advancement to reservoir simulation practices, offering a potent, efficient tool for CCS monitoring. By integrating DMD for ROM construction with precise data assimilation-based calibration, the study provides a comprehensive solution for swift and accurate subsurface CO2 plume tracking, essential for the successful implementation of CCS projects and the broader effort to mitigate climate change impacts.</description>

                In recent years, issues related to climate change and the negative impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment have become increasingly acute, attracting the attention of governments, non-governmental organizations, and the international community as a whole. Now more than ever, the development of sustainable models of activity is necessary to reduce the negative impact of CO2 on the environment and to promote sustainable development. Transport is one of the biggest polluters and We think that we can change it. Reducing transport emissions can significantly contribute to achieving greenhouse gas reduction targets. In this regard, public transportation is much more energy-efficient than individual cars and can significantly reduce CO2 emissions. Additionally, promoting the use of eco-friendly modes of transportation, such as bicycles or electric vehicles, can also contribute to reducing transport emissions. Promoting sustainable transport can be an effective solution to reducing the negative impact of CO2 on the environment and creating a sustainable model of activity. If we want a better life for us and our future generations, we must know and promote a policy that will reduce the emissions of CO2 and will transform our planet into a better place.</description>

                The electrochemical conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals using renewable electricity shows significant promise for achieving carbon neutrality and providing alternative energy storage solutions. However, its practical application still faces significant challenges, including high energy consumption, poor selectivity, and limited stability. Here, we propose a hybrid acid/alkali electrolyzer that couples the acidic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at the cathode with alkaline methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) at the anode. This dual electro&#8208;synthesis cell is implemented by developing Bi nanosheets as cathode catalysts and oxide&#8208;decorated Cu2Se nanoflowers as anode catalysts, enabling high&#8208;efficiency electron utilization for formate production with over 180% coulombic efficiency and more than 90% selectivity for both CO2RR and MOR conversion. The hybrid acid/alkali CO2RR&#8208;MOR cell also demonstrates long&#8208;term stability exceeding 100 hours of continuous operation, delivers a formate partial current density of 130 mA cm&#8208;2 at a voltage of only 2.1 V, and significantly reduces electricity consumption compared to the traditional CO2 electrolysis system. This study illuminates an innovative electron&#8208;efficiency and energy&#8208;saving techniques for CO2 electrolysis, as well as the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts.</description>

                Background In the emergency department (ED), there are pre-assembled tonsillar hemorrhage trays for management of post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage and peritonsillar abscess. After use, the tray is sent to the medical device reprocessing (MDR) department for decontamination, sterilization, and re-organization, all at a significant cost to the hospital and environment. Objective The goal of this project was to reduce unnecessary instruments on the tonsil hemorrhage tray by 30% by 1 year and report on the associated cost and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions savings. Methods This quality improvement project was framed according to the Institute for Healthcare Improvement&#8217;s Model for Improvement. ED and Otolaryngology&#8211;Head &amp; Neck Surgery staff and residents were surveyed to determine which instruments on the tonsil hemorrhage trays were used regularly. Based on results, a new tray was developed and compared to the old tray using MDR data and existing CO 2 emissions calculations. Results Tray optimization resulted in a total cost reduction from $1092.63 to $330.21 per tray per year, decreased processing time from 12 to 6-8 minutes per tray, and decreased CO 2 emissions from 6.11 to 2.85 kg per year for the old versus new tray, respectively. Overall, the new tray contains half the number of instruments, takes half the time to assemble, produces 50% less CO 2 emissions, and will save the hospital approximately $100,000 over 10 years. Conclusion Healthcare costs and environmental sustainability are collective responsibilities. Surgical and procedure tray optimization is a simple, effective, and scalable form of eco-action.</description>

                This study aims to examine the influence of NaOCl, NaCl and contact time on the inactivation of aerobic bacteria in tilapia fillets treated with micro-nano bubbles of CO2 (CO2 MNB) in a washing process of fish fillets, and compared to soaking with tap water and untreated fillets for their shelf-life extensions. Response surface methodology (RSM) with a central composite design was used to compare and predict of the inactivation effects. The fish fillets were soaked in a NaOCl solution before washing with a NaCl solution and CO2 MNB produced from an MNB generator system, maintaining the liquid temperature in the range of 4&#8211;7 &#176;C for all experiments. According to the regression analysis from the experimental design, aerobic bacteria inactivation was reduced by 1.509 log CFU/g at 100 mg/L NaOCl, 10%w/v NaCl, and a contact time of 32 min with CO2 MNB. The experimental value of the reduction of aerobic bacteria by 1.503 &#177; 0.009 log CFU/g (before washing 5.623 log CFU/g; after washing 4.120 log CFU/g) was found after treatment under the aforementioned condition. The number of aerobic bacteria counted on the tilapia fillets treated with the upper condition after being stored at 4 &#177; 2 &#176;C for 7 d was below the acceptable limits, but untreated and treated with tap water had bacteria counts exceeding the upper microbial limit (6 log CFU/g). The combined results showed that the NaOCl, NaCl solution and CO2 MNB treatment could extend the storage time by more than 7 d.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically Conductive and Cu&#8208;Functionalized Polymer&#8208;Composite Membranes as Gas Diffusion Electrodes for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202401228</link>
      <description>Ignacio Sanju&#225;n, Vaibhav Kumbhar, Oleg Prymak, Mathias Ulbricht, Alfred Ludwig, Lukas Fischer, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401273289

                We introduced a new class of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) with adjustable pore morphology. We fabricated intrinsically conductive polymer&#8208;composite membranes containing carbon filler, enabling a pore structure variation through film casting cum phase separation protocols. We further selectively functionalized specific pore regions of the membranes with Cu by a NaBH4&#8208;facilitated coating strategy. The as&#8208;obtained GDEs can facilitate the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at Cu active sites that are presented inside a defined and electrically conductive pore system. When employing them as free&#8208;standing cathodes in a CO2 flow electrolyzer, we achieved &gt;70% Faradaic efficiencies for CO2RR products at up to 200 mA/cm2. We further demonstrated that deposition of a dense Cu layer on top of the membrane leads to obstruction of the underlying pore openings, inhibiting an excessive wetting of the pore pathways that transport gaseous CO2. However, the presentation of Cu inside the pore system of our novel membrane electrodes increased the C2H4/CO selectivity by a factor of up to 3 compared to Cu presented in the dense layer on top of the membrane. Additionally, we found that gaseous CO2 could still access Cu in macropores after wetting with electrolyte, while CO2RR was completely suppressed in wetted nm&#8208;scale pores.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study on Optimization of Combustion Cycle Parameters and Exhaust Gas Emissions in Marine Dual-Fuel Engines by Adjusting Ammonia Injection Phases</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse12081340</link>
      <description>Martynas Drazdauskas, Serg&#279;jus Lebedevas, Journal of Marine Science and Engineering. 12(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401391371

                Decarbonizing maritime transport hinges on transitioning oil-fueled ships (98.4% of the fleet) to renewable and low-carbon fuel types. This shift is crucial for meeting the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets set by the IMO and the EU, with the aim of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. Ammonia, which does not contain carbon atoms that generate CO2, is considered one of the effective solutions for decarbonization in the medium and long term. However, the concurrent increase in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions during the ammonia combustion cycle, subject to strict regulation by the MARPOL 73/78 convention, necessitates implementing solutions to reduce them through optimizing the combustion cycle. This publication presents a numerical study on the optimization of diesel and ammonia injection phases in a ship&#8217;s medium-speed engine, Wartsila 6L46. The study investigates the exhaust gas emissions and combustion cycle parameters through a high-pressure injection strategy. At an identified 7&#176; CAD injection phase distance between diesel and ammonia, along with an optimal dual-fuel start of injection 10&#176; CAD before TDC, a reduction of 47% in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG = CO2 + CH4 + N2O) was achieved compared to the diesel combustion cycle. This result aligns with the GHG reduction target set by both the IMO and the EU for 2030. Additionally, during the investigation of the thermodynamic combustion characteristics of the cycle, a comparative reduction in NOx of 4.6% was realized. This reduction is linked to the DeNOx process, where the decrease in NOx is offset by an increase in N2O. However, the optimized ammonia combustion cycle results in significant emissions of unburnt NH3, reaching 1.5 g/kWh. In summary, optimizing the combustion cycle of dual ammonia and diesel fuel is essential for achieving efficient and reliable engine performance. Balancing combustion efficiency with emission levels of greenhouse gases, unburned NH3, and NOx is crucial. For the Wartsila 6L46 marine diesel engine, the recommended injection phasing is A710/D717, with a 7&#176; CAD between injection phases.</description>

      <title>Most of the Long-Term Solar Radiation Forcing on the Climate Is Due to the Strong Feedback Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.30564/jees.v6i3.6502</link>
      <description>H. I. Abdussamatov, Journal of Environmental &amp; Earth Sciences. 6(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401301309

                The main interactions of the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) variations with the climatic system are considered. This research introduced new physically based indexes for 11-year cycles: the integral relative energetic power of the cycles solar activity (SA) and TSI, as well as the cycle-weighted mean value both of the TSI and sunspot number. The observed cycle-average TSI value in cycles XXII&#8211;XXIV has decreased by more than 0.5 W/m2, indicating its quasi-bicentennial decline. The onset of the Maunder-type Grand minimum phase of the SA and TSI of the quasi-bicentennial cycle (BCC) is expected in the 27th or 28th 11-year cycle in 2042 or 2053. The Earth's thermal inertia will cause a temperature reduction of around 0.25 K due to the deficit in TSI during the declining phase of the bicentennial cycle due to its negative impact on Earth's energy imbalance. As a result, the Bond's albedo will increase, and the abundance of atmospheric water vapor and carbon dioxide will decrease as a response to a direct solar forcing. BCC feedback mechanisms will also continue operating during both its minimum and maximum phases. The feedback mechanisms will continue further in short periods (about 30 years) at the beginning of BCC's growth and decline phases. These long-term self-reinforcing feedback effects will act as a response to the TSI, forcing in such a way as to trigger a strong amplification of the initial direct input to the corresponding temperature changes. They will lead to a significant increasing cooling in 2070 or 2080. Variations of the galactic cosmic rays and cloud cover practically do not affect the climate. The quasi-bicentennial cyclicity of the TSI also provides simultaneous climate variations on all Solar system planets.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Compressibility and Other Thermodynamic Derivative Properties of CO2 Using Sonic Velocity for CCS and Enhanced Geothermal Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/221413-ms</link>
      <description>Ram R. Ratnakar, No host. 59(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401349083

                Abstract Reduction in Carbon-footprint has been gaining attention in variety of industries from manufacturing to energy due to the geopolitical pressures and climate related issues. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and enhanced geothermal systems using CO2 as energy carrier are some of the possible decarbonization pathways. Process design for these options requires accurate estimation of thermochemical properties of CO2 at various temperature/pressure conditions, in both subcritical and supercritical regions. The objective of this work is to present coupled experimental- and equation-of-state (EOS) modeling based on general framework to estimate heat capacities, enthalpy, entropy, sonic velocity, density, Joule-Thomson coefficient, and compressibility of CO2 that is applicable to wide range of pressure and temperature conditions. The sonic velocity measurement is based on a pulse-echo technique while the density measurements were performed in a PVT cell. The subject measurements were conducted at two temperatures (300 and 311K), one below and the other one being above the critical temperature of CO2 (304K). The pressure points for the measurements range between 1 - 200 bar. Phase behavior is modeled using Peng and Robinson (1976, 1978) Equation of State (PR78-EOS) with Peneloux et al. (1982) volume-shift shift to accurately determine the CO2 density. First, the ideal part of the CO2 heat capacity is obtained from correlations available in literature and the residual part is obtained using the EOS. After evaluation of the heat capacities, enthalpy, entropy, speed of sound, Joule-Thomson coefficient and compressibility are directly obtained from EOS. This work presents experimental and modeling results on sonic velocity and density of CO2 at two different temperatures (300 and 311K) within the pressure range of 1- 200 bar. An EOS-based framework, utilizing PR78 with Peneloux et al. volume shift, is developed to determine the CO2 properties (such as phase boundary, density, heat capacities, enthalpy, entropy, sonic velocity and compressibility) at extended pressure and temperature conditions. The main results of this study are as follows: Experimental results on density and sonic velocity are aligned with the measured data found in the literature.Estimation of the CO2 properties from EOS-based framework agrees very well with the literature and newly presented data within, all within 1-3% relative error.Compressibility of the fluid is derived directly from the experimental measurements, bypassing the density-derivative-based approach and hence avoiding the significant errors associated with the discrete density data containing noise/fluctuations and as well as the nature of the compressibility being a derivative property.Most importantly, the framework is general, and applicable for the use of other EOS models, and can also be extended to other fluid systems. Novelty of this work lies in new experimental data on sonic velocity and density of CO2 (especially at high pressures) as well as development of an EOS-framework to determine thermodynamic properties of CO2 through sonic velocity. Proposed framework leads to more accurate estimation of compressibility, density, sonic velocity, heat capacities, enthalpy and entropy.</description>

                The determination of magmatic mineralogy based on the oxidation-reduction state of magma by primary inclusion geochemistry of RAMAN equipment has identified Ngoc Tu granitoid blocks in the oxidation state represented by CO2-rich primary inclusions. Redox conditions help explain the specialized chemistry of geochemistry not only at the content level, but also in terms of the geochemical behavior of the elements. This shows that the Ngoc Tu granitoid block is not favorable for the metal potential of Sn, but is favorable for the movement of Mo and W from the magma solution to the ore solution.</description>

      <title>All paths to the same end?&#8212;a comparative study on carbon emissions reduction effects of digital finance and green finance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1433044</link>
      <description>Shasha Jiang, Li Wang, Frontiers in Environmental Science. 12(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401232493

                The massive CO2 emission has caused frequent occurrence of climate problems, and a typical response to climate change has reached international consensus. Digital finance and green finance, as a subversion of the traditional financial model, have become significant drivers of global carbon emissions reduction efforts. Based on the panel data, this paper profoundly compares the effects of carbon emissions reduction, mechanisms, and heterogeneous results of two forms of finance. Research finds that technology-centered digital finance focuses on suppressing carbon emissions through technological innovation, and the higher the level of regional economic is, the stronger the role of digital finance in suppressing carbon emissions through technological innovation. The concept-centered green finance focuses on carbon emissions reduction through industrial ecologization, and government-led environmental regulation plays a positive regulatory role. Although the paths of affecting carbon emissions are different, there is a natural fit between the two in terms of the essential goal of carbon emissions reduction. Based on the consideration of the differences in geographic location and financial development level, the carbon emission reduction effects of two forms of finance show apparent heterogeneity. Based on the spatial characteristics of digital finance and carbon emissions, this paper further finds that the digital finance&#8217;s carbon emission reduction effects have apparent spatial spillovers. These findings provide an essential direction to formulate a reasonable carbon emissions reduction plan and accelerate realizing the &#8220;double carbon&#8221; goal.</description>

                Geological fractures are mechanical breaks in subsurface rock volumes that provide important subsurface flow pathways. However, the presence of fractures can cause unwanted challenges, such as gas leakage through fractured caprocks, which must be addressed. In this study, the dynamics of enzymatically induced carbonate precipitation in rock fractures and their subsequent influence on CO2 leakage were investigated from a pore-scale perspective for the first time. This was achieved through real-time monitoring of the injection of the solution into a rock-microfluidic flow cell using optical and scanning electron microscopy. It was revealed that the main growth dynamics occur during the first three injection cycles, with growth continuing until the fracture aperture is fully closed in the 6th cycle. Based on the flow simulation, a significant reduction of up to 25% in the CO2 conductivity of the original fracture is expected even after the first treatment cycle. Future studies are suggested to explore different resolutions, testing conditions, and to conduct 3-dimensional investigations of the growth dynamics.</description>

      <description>Dyah Paramita, Rizki Aziz, Shinta Indah, CIVED. 10(3)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4401373126

                Pariaman City's waste generation in 2022 is 38.26 tons/day. Waste management in Pariaman City is still not optimal, resulting in waste piling up in TPA South Tungkal. The waste reduction value at the research location after processing with BSF larvae can reduce 0.005 tons/day or 0.02% of the total waste generation in Pariaman City. The environmental impacts in waste management studied are Global Warming Potential (GWP), Acidification Potential (AP), and Eutrophication Potential (EP). Reducing the environmental impact of processing organic waste has been carried out, the smallest impact reduction results were obtained, namely in scenario 1, namely processing organic waste with BSF larvae in waste banks and TPS 3R. The results obtained were the impact characterization value from comparing several impact categories. GWP value 32,060,838.136 103 kg CO2-eq, AP 0.00246 x103 SO2-eq, and EP 0.00134 x103 kg PO4-3. So it can be concluded that scenario 1 has a smaller GWP, AP, and EP impact on the environment compared to scenario 0 and is used as the best alternative scenario for waste management in Pariaman City</description>

                Abstract In the coming decades many thousands of fields and tens of thousands of wells globally will reach the end of their commercial life due to dwindling production rates and will need to be decommissioned at a substantial cost. The scale of the task can be appreciated by considering that in Southeast Asia alone, it is forecast that approximately 1,500 platforms and over 7,000 wells are projected to need decommissioning by 2030 with costs estimated to range from $30 billion to as high as $100 billion (Evans, 2019). At the same time as the backlog for decommissioning grows, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere continue to increase (www.co2.earth/daily-co2) without viable at-scale alternatives to eliminate fossil fuel use for the foreseeable future. Since governments world-wide (Carver, 2021) have committed to net zero targets or substantial reductions in CO2 emissions in the coming decades, there is a pressing need to address how to maintain use of fossils fuels (in countries and for activities for which there are no alternatives) while at the same time reducing or maintaining atmospheric CO2 concentrations at existing levels (12 countries have passed legislation on net zero targets and over 190 countries signed the Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty on climate change reached at COP21 in 2015, including all ASEAN nations). While the process of reducing or removing CO2 emissions from various sources is not straightforward for any country, there are a convergence of challenges faced by ASEAN nations. In the last two decades, a time of rapid economic development, renewable energy sources have not gained ground on fossil fuels in the overall total energy consumption of ASEAN nations (The World Bank, 2024) and data show a decrease in ratio of renewable energy generated compared to total energy consumed. Although the share of electricity generated from renewable sources increased from 2015 to 2020 it was insufficient to offset the increased fossil fuel use in transport and industry sectors (Lau, 2022). The slow increase in renewable energy generation can be partly attributed to sustainability concerns with both hydropower and bioenergy in ASEAN, for example, the over-damming of the Mekong River and the clearing of rainforest in Borneo (Lau, 2022). Furthermore, the deployment of other effective methods of renewable energy generation such as wind turbines and solar panels are less well suited to ASEAN countries. Minimum windspeeds across much of the region fall below the 4 m/s threshold level for efficient use of a wind turbine, except for coastal areas around Philippines and Vietnam where wind speeds are higher (Lau, 2022). Solar is rated as a moderate potential renewable source, with other parts of Asia rated higher, (Lau, 2022) but it requires a significant landmass to make a meaningful contribution, which is not available due to the dense population in ASEAN. Lau, 2022, assessed that it is unlikely that renewable energies will replace energy generated from fossil fuels within the 2030&#8211;2050 timeframe and fossil fuels will remain an important part of the energy mix requiring ASEAN countries to adopt strategies and technologies to mitigate CO2 emissions.</description>

      <title>Structural Changes in Chile&#8217;s Industries to Reduce Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emissions: An Emissions Multiplier Product Matrix Analysis (eMPM)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16156615</link>
      <description>Sergio Seminara, Jean Pierre Doussoulin, Sustainability. 16(15)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401252088

                Most countries in the world have agreed to reduce their emissions following the COP21 agreement in Paris, and as a result, each nation has presented suitable plans to do so. Chile is not an exception in this regard. This article examines the emissions of Chilean industries using the emission multiplier product matrix (eMPM), a cutting-edge method that estimates the pollution caused by inter-industrial activity in the country&#8217;s regions by integrating CO2 emissions with multi-region input&#8211;output table (MRIO) databases and elasticities. This approach connects the major emissions-producing sectors to the regions where these emissions come from, thereby accounting for existing interregional linkages. The application of technology, along with adequate state regulation in compliance with Chile&#8217;s pledges, acquired following the COP25 call, will decide the level of improvement in emissions reduction.</description>

                Background. The current state and pressures associated with the anthropogenic impact on the Caspian region environment are examined. Surrounded by five coastal countries, including the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Russian Federation, the Republic of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Caspian Sea is the world&#8217;s largest endorheic water body. The isolation of the Caspian Sea, which is characterized by special climatic conditions and salinity gradients, has led to the formation of a unique ecosystem. Aim. Environmental impact assessment of the Caspian region and the associated anthropogenetic load. Materials and methods. The anthropogenic processes affecting the environment of the Caspian Sea and the surrounding area were assessed using the DPSIR concept. This concept includes the components of driving forces, pressures, state, impacts, and response in order to inclusively determine the connections between human activities and the environment. This concept was used as by the European Environmental Agency as the basis for integrated environmental analysis. Results. The conducted study determined the scale and geography of greenhouse gas degassing, the volume of pollutant emissions into the atmosphere by components, the structure of greenhouse gas emissions, and the dynamics of emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen oxide generated from stationary sources in the Caspian region. Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases that pollute the atmosphere and sea waters, generated from stationary sources, are formed as a result of the production activities of a number of industries: mining; electricity, gas, and steam generation; air conditioning; manufacturing; water supply; wastewater treatment; construction industry; agriculture and forestry; transport storage and communications; repair of vehicles and motorcycles; as well as other activities. Conclusion. The share of enterprises in the fuel and energy complex that emit greenhouse gases is about 60%. The structure of greenhouse gas emissions and the dynamics of CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O emissions generated from stationary sources in the Caspian region are shown. The Caspian Sea is one of the most important endorheic basins in the world. Being surrounded by land on all sides, the Caspian Sea lacks flows that would maintain its self-purification. Pollutants that enter the Sea remain there due to the lack of mechanisms for their removal. Complete information about the level of pollutant inputs is crucial for selecting the most effective means of environmental compensation or pollution reduction. The largest polluting sectors are agriculture, industry, including oil and gas, and urbanization.</description>

      <title>LPG-Diesel Dual Fuel Emission Characteristics: A Review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.47611/jsr.v13i1.2368</link>
      <description>Turki Al-Amoodi, M. A. H. Khalafalla, Samer F. Ahmed, Journal of Student Research. 13(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401325880

                The global shift away from fossil fuels for energy, driven by concerns about emissions and energy security, has sparked significant interest in alternative fuels. One promising approach involves combining alternative fuels, like Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG), with traditional diesel engines. This strategy, known as the dual-fuel concept, aims to harness the strengths of each fuel type while reducing emissions and improving engine performance. This review focuses primarily on LPG as a dual fuel for diesel engines. LPG, a gaseous fuel primarily composed of propane and butane, offers substantial environmental benefits, including a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions, a 30% reduction in CO emissions, and a 50% reduction in NOx emissions compared to diesel. However, using pure LPG in diesel engines faces a challenge related to its ignition behavior. This challenge can be overcome by blending LPG with substances like Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) or diesel fuel, which act as ignition enhancers. The main goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential advantages and applicability of the dual-fuel system combining diesel and LPG. It will explore various experimental setups, designs, and injection techniques, presenting diverse findings related to both engine performance and emissions. Additionally, the review will discuss additives that can further improve the combustion process. Overall, the research highlights the promising role of LPG as a dual fuel in reducing emissions and enhancing the efficiency of diesel engines, contributing to a more sustainable energy future.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Sustainable Aviation Fuels: Impact of Nano-Additives and Ammonia-Based Strategies On Emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4066154</link>
      <description>Pasquale Di Gloria, Maria Grazia De Giorgi, Luciano Strafella, Giuseppe Ciccarella, Grazio Gregorio Castelluzzo, Francesca Baldassarre, Antonio Ficarella, Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401338365

                Abstract Our study investigates the impact of ammonia- and water-based nano-particulate additives on the combustion characteristics of Jet-A1 aviation fuel, using a 300-kW liquid swirl combustor. Experiments were conducted at two global equivalence ratios (&#934; = 0.24 and &#934; = 0.40), focusing on laminar flame speed (LFS) and flame properties through chemiluminescence imaging and modal analysis techniques. The primary objective was to understand how these nano-additives modulate flame dynamics and internal chemical reactions, alongside evaluating the environmental implications of combustion alterations. Results showed that integrating urea and water additives into the fuel matrix affected LFS, enhancing it at the lower equivalence ratio but having detrimental effects at the higher ratio. Modal analysis revealed a notable stabilizing influence on flame behavior, especially under leaner fuel conditions. The addition of water and urea influenced combustion chemistry and spray patterns, leading to more uniform sprays and more complete combustion. Chemiluminescence imaging demonstrated higher emission intensity of NH2* radicals compared to NH* radicals, varying with the global equivalence ratio. The data indicated a significant reduction in NOx emissions, particularly at lower equivalence ratios, accompanied by a slight increase in CO2 and CO emissions. This study highlights the potential of ammonia- and water-based nano-additives to enhance the combustion performance and environmental outcomes of Jet-A1 aviation fuel, with the trade-off of increased CO2 and CO emissions requiring further consideration.</description>

      <title>Integrated Use of Furnace Bottom Ash as Fine Aggregate and Cement Replacement for Sustainable Mortar Production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17153834</link>
      <description>Waiching Tang, Ali M. Onaizi, Sagheer A. Onaizi, Umer Sajjad, Yanju Liu, Materials. 17(15)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401244048

                Recycling fly ash (FA) and furnace bottom ash (FBA) help with reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving natural resources, and minimizing waste accumulation. However, research on recycling FBA is progressing more slowly compared to FA. This research aims to investigate the combined use of FBA as a replacement for both fine aggregate and cement and its influence on the performance of mortar. The findings indicated that incorporating 25% FBA as a fine aggregate replacement and 10% or 20% ground FBA (GFBA) as a cement replacement significantly enhanced compressive strength after 28 and 56 days. Flexural strength was comparable to control mortar at 28 days and superior at 56 days. However, increasing the FBA content beyond 25% as a fine aggregate replacement reduced workability and increased porosity, which negatively affected mechanical performance and water absorption. Microstructural analyses revealed denser and more compact structures in the mortar with combined FBA replacement for both fine aggregate and cement, specifically 25% as a fine aggregate replacement and 10% and 20% as cement replacements. Optimal performance was noted in mixtures with Ca/Si and Ca/Al ratios within the ranges of 1.8&#8211;1.5 and 0.24&#8211;0.19, respectively. Trace element leaching analysis has not shown significant differences between GFBA, FA, and OPC. Regarding environmental impact assessment, using FBA as a fine aggregate replacement did not show a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, but replacing cement with FBA reduced emissions remarkably. Generally, using FBA as a replacement for both fine aggregate and cement in mortar enhances compressive and flexural strengths at optimal levels, promotes sustainability by reducing landfill waste and CO2 emissions, and supports cleaner production practices despite some workability challenges.</description>

      <title>Electron Deficiency is More Important than Conductivity in C&#8722;N Coupling for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>

                The electrocatalytic C&#8722;N coupling from CO2 and nitrate emerges as one of the solutions for waste upgrading and urea synthesis. In this work, we constructed electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites by the strong metal&#8208;polymer semiconductor interaction, to boost efficient and durable urea synthesis. In situ Raman spectroscopy identified the existence of electron&#8208;deficient Cu sites and was able to withstand electrochemical reduction conditions. Operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations disclosed the vital role of electron&#8208;deficient Cu in adsorption and C&#8722;N coupling of oxygen&#8208;containing species. The electron&#8208;deficient Cu displayed a high urea yield rate of 255.0 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode and excellent electrochemical durability, superior than that of non&#8208;electron&#8208;deficient counterpart with conductive carbon material as the support. It can be concluded that the regulation of site electronic structure is more important than the optimization of catalyst conductive properties in the C&#8722;N coupling reactions.</description>

      <title>Characteristics and performance evaluation of foam &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; generated by microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0219942</link>
      <description>Jian Fu, Yulong Liu, Cenqian Zhang, Chenyue Wang, Qing Feng, Xiaonan Li, Shanshan Sun, Yuehui She, Fan Zhang, Physics of Fluids. 36(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401257396

                Foam can effectively improve reservoir heterogeneity, increase gas&#8211;liquid flow rate, reduce viscous fingering, and help to improve sweep efficiency. This paper mainly studies the characteristics and performance of microbial foam production, and proposes an enhanced oil recovery method for profile control by in situ microbial foam production. By optimizing the carbon and nitrogen sources of the medium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 produced single and double rhamnolipids and biogas composed of N2, CO2, and CH4, and it could also produce foam in high salt, weak acid, and weak alkali environments. Gas injection experiments were carried out using self-produced biogas, the foaming effect is good in the range of gas&#8211;liquid ratio 1:1&#8211;3:1 and gas injection speed 20&#8211;40 ml/min, which was 71.43%&#8211;91.25% more than the foam volume produced by CO2 injection, and the foam production was positively correlated with the protein concentration of the foam. In the early stage of incubation, the foam was 20&#8211;100 &#956;m in diameter, with high protein concentration and strong foam stability, which slowed down the drainage, polymerization, and disproportionation of the liquid film of the foam system. The foam performance test results show that the foam half-lifetime is long, up to 109 min. Foam culture medium has good viscosity reduction effect, emulsifying properties and less corrosive. The displacement experiment shows that the foam generated in situ by PAO1 in the core has good stability, reproducibility, and profile control performance, which can reduce the permeability of the core to half of the initial permeability and improve the reservoir heterogeneity. Therefore, microbial in situ foam production can be an effective method to enhance oil recovery in heterogeneous reservoirs, which is low cost, low pollution, and simple operation.</description>

      <title>Reviewing The Roadmap: Feasibility Studies on CCUS Implementation In Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/221664-ms</link>
      <description>M. Bassey, Innocent O. Oboh, SPE Nigeria Annual International Conference and Exhibition. 6(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401349337

                Abstract The Paris agreement in 2015 saw nations agree to a global temperature limit below 2&#176;C above pre-industrial levels. This agreement over time has come under threat as the International Energy Agency reported an increase in global emissions by 0.9%, with Africa contributing only 4% per capita to global emissions, and Nigeria, contributing 0.64 tonnes per capita of the 4%. This explicitly illustrates the imbalance when African countries, who are among the least contributors, have to deal with climate change as they reap its adverse effects. Most African countries, do, however depend on the oil industry, for not just its nations&#8217; economy, but for energy supply. This is why, in ensuring that economies are protected and energy distribution is still held tantamount while protecting the earth, technologies such as CCUS are a necessary option to be considered and incorporated into the energy sector and other heavy industries. CCUS over the years has proven to be the most feasible options for oil producing nations, particularly those with high energy needs. In this paper, the feasibilities of CCUS implementation in Nigeria is explored, its economic and policy implications that follow, in relation to the Paris Agreement in 2015 and the just concluded COP 28. The cost implications for identified sequestration locations such as Port Harcourt and Lokoja and other possible sites in the country, currently hold storage capacities of 100-1000Mt CO2, and an average abatement cost of $42/tonne. This paper explores funding measures for CCUS in-country as well as policy adjustments, utilization of captured CO2 and what this means for multinational and indigenous companies in the country and on the continent, their roles and commitments in the international community and how their investments in emission reductions in Nigeria and other African countries can be a huge step towards achieving the Paris agreement and protecting the earth.</description>

                Abstract The escalating threat of climate change necessitates innovative solutions to mitigate carbon emissions. This paper addresses the challenge by proposing a groundbreaking integrated system that combines Blue Hydrogen production through Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and the sustainable generation of fertilizer using Chlorella Algae. The synergistic approach not only reduces carbon emissions but also fosters sustainable agriculture. The study meticulously details the methodologies employed for Blue Hydrogen production and Chlorella Algae cultivation. It explicates the chosen SMR technologies, the intricacies of Chlorella Algae cultivation, and the orchestrated synergy between the two processes, emphasizing the utilization of waste heat and CO2 from SMR for algae cultivation. The findings from this study encompasses technical feasibility, economic viability, and scalability aspects of the integrated system. The results reveal the potential for significant greenhouse gas emission reduction, validated through life cycle assessments and comparisons with conventional methods. This research projects a promising pathway for sustainable energy and agriculture and fosters sustainable practice on a global scale.</description>

      <title>Low-carbon wastewater treatment and resource recovery of recirculating aquaculture system by immobilized chlorella vulgaris based on machine learning optimization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2024.131208</link>

                Immobilized microalgae biotechnologies can conserve water and space by low-carbon wastewater treatment and resource recovery in a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS). However, technical process parameters have been unoptimized considering the mutual interaction between factors. In this study, machine learning optimized the parameters of alginate-immobilized Chlorella vulgaris (C. vulgaris), that is, 474 &#956;mol/(m2&#183;s) of light intensity, 23 &#215; 106 cells/mL for initial cell number, and 2.07 mm particle size. Importantly, under continuous illumination, the immobilized C. vulgaris and microalgal-bacterial consortium improved water purification and biomass reutilization. Transcriptomics of C. vulgaris showed enhanced nitrogen removal by increasing pyridine nucleotide and lipid accumulation via enhanced triacylglycerol synthesis. Symbiotic bacteria upregulated genes for nitrate reduction and organic matter degradation, which stimulated biomass accumulation through CO2 fixation and starch synthesis. The recoverable microalgae (1.94 g/L biomass, 47 % protein, 26.23 % lipids), struvite (64.79 % phosphorus), and alginate (79.52 %) every two weeks demonstrates a low-carbon resource recovery in RAS.</description>

      <description>Pia Rebelo, Hart Publishing eBooks. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401267127

                This book applies a contract-governance theory to the implementation of decarbonisation objectives in the international maritime sector. In doing so, it provides an overview of how the network of contractual relationships that characterise commercial shipping can become effective sites of collaboration between shipping actors to improve upon energy efficiency and CO2 reduction. To achieve this aim, the book investigates and develops a set of contractual tools that can enable private actors to strengthen their commitments to net-zero targets (whether state-mandated or voluntary) and develop cooperative norms to guide decision-making and contractual interpretation. These mechanisms include contractual clauses and drafting considerations which can secure a desired outcome for contractual performance, thereby managing climate risks and providing adequate remedy where such risks materialise. In a transnational sector such as shipping, where contracts can exert greater influence on corporate decarbonisation efforts than international regulation, the book challenges the traditional limitations of contract law and calls for a deeper integration of green principles into private relationships.</description>

                The rational manipulation of the surface reconstruction of catalysts is a key factor in achieving highly efficient water oxidation, but it is a challenge due to the complex reaction conditions. Herein, we introduce a novel in situ reconstruction strategy under a gradient magnetic field to form highly catalytically active species on the surface of ferromagnetic/non&#8208;magnetic CoFe2O4@CoBDC core&#8208;shell structure for electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We demonstrate that the Kelvin force from the cores&#8217; local gradient magnetic field modulates the shells&#8217; surface reconstruction, leading to a higher proportion of Co2+ as active sites. These Co sites with optimized electronic configuration exhibit more favorable adsorption energy for oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates and lower the activation energy of the overall catalytic reaction. As a result, a significant enhancement in OER performance is achieved with a large current density increment about 128% at 1.63 V and an overpotential reduction by 28 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 after reconstruction. Interestingly, after removing the external magnetic field, the activity could persist for over 100 h. This work showcases the directional surface reconstruction of catalysts under a gradient magnetic field for enhanced water oxidation.</description>

      <title>Modelling And Simulation Of Renewable Technologies For Economic And Environmental Analysis And Optimization Of Dairy Farms</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.34719/tcud9414</link>
      <description>Michael Breen, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401392626

                The aim of this thesis was to develop a dairy optimisation platform to optimise investments in dairy farm technology and changes to on-farm management practices and electricity tariffs, in order to maximise profitability and minimise environmental impacts. Increased dairy herd sizes and milk production levels in Ireland as well as changing regulations concerning emissions, renewable penetration and energy efficiency have necessitated a means of financial decision support for farmers. Therefore this body of work focused on the creation of a comprehensive method for optimising dairy farm technology selection, management practices and electricity tariffs. The measures which could be implemented on dairy farms to improve economic performance and reduce environmental impacts were categorised in this study under the headings of efficiency through technology adoption, efficiency through management practices, and reduction in primary energy through renewable generation. To improve efficiency through technology adoption, technologies including plate heat exchangers, variable speed drives, solar thermal water heating and heat recovery systems were considered. To improve efficiency through management practices, load shifting measures were considered. To reduce primary energy through renewable generation, photovoltaic systems and wind turbines were considered. A comprehensive optimisation method was required which took into account all measures and the relationships between them, while the conflicting goals of improving profitability and environmental performance necessitated the use of multi-objective optimisation to assess trade-offs between these goals. Moreover, to facilitate the analysis of efficiency through technology adoption, efficiency through management practices, and reduction in primary energy through Abstract xxi renewable generation, validated scalable models of energy efficient and renewable technologies were created which enabled their effect on dairy farm profitability and environmental performance to be quantified. These models were employed when carrying out multi-objective optimisation to optimise dairy farm technology, management practices and electricity tariffs for maximisation of dairy farm net profit, minimisation of farm electricity related CO2 emissions, maximisation of farm renewable contribution and optimisation of milking start times for farmers. Trade-offs between these objectives were also assessed. A test case of a 195 cow farm was employed to demonstrate the applicability and usefulness of the optimisation platform, with results indicating that farm electricity related CO2 emissions could be reduced by 40%, 3% and 31% through technology adoption, management practices and renewable generation respectively. Furthermore, the use of a plate heat exchanger was the most economically feasible technology of the technologies examined. It is anticipated that the methods presented in this thesis will be used as a comprehensive means of decision support for farm advisors, policymakers and farmers. The outputs of the thesis will enable these key stakeholders to make prudent decisions pertaining to investments in technology and farm management changes, in order to increase farm profitability and contribute to national greenhouse gas mitigation.</description>

      <title>Wastewater Treatment for Nutrients and Pathogens in a Demonstration-Scale Outdoor Constructed Wetland System</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/w16152198</link>

                A demonstration-scale outdoor constructed wetland (CW) wastewater treatment system was evaluated for about two years for its effectiveness in treating septic system effluents. The system included three treatment cells: an anaerobic cell, an aerated cell, and a basic oxygen furnace slag (BOFS)-based phosphorus (P) treatment cell. High removal efficiencies were achieved, with reductions of &gt;99% for PO4-P, &gt;83% for NH3-N, &gt;99% for cBOD5, and &gt;76% for COD, with influent concentrations averaging 6, 48, 63, and 143 mg L&#8722;1, respectively. Additionally, pathogen removal was high, with an over 99% decrease in E. coli and total coliform levels. The BOFS cell was critical, elevating effluent pH to 10.9 &#177; 1.5, which effectively inactivated pathogens. Environmental safety before discharge was ensured by CO2(g) sparging to adjust the pH and a zero-valent iron layer in the BOFS cell to control dissolved metal concentrations. Analytical techniques (FESEM-EDX, FTIR, and XANES) confirmed the formation of Ca carbonate and Ca phosphate on spent BOFS, highlighting their role in the treatment process. This study highlights the potential of integrating complementary technologies in constructed wetlands for sustainable and efficient wastewater management.</description>

                The U.S. dairy sector is a significant emitter of methane and nitrous oxide, with the US EPA estimating it produced around 90 Tg CO2 eq. in 2021. This paper reviews the literature on and evaluates various mitigation actions for reducing GHG emissions in the U.S. dairy sector, focusing on both direct and indirect emission sources. We conducted a narrative literature review based on the cradle to gate life-cycle assessment method, covering the entire dairy supply chain up until milk enters retail establishments, including dairy and feed producing farm practices, processing, transportation, and their associated emissions/costs. The papers included were selected over a three year process depending on discussions with experts and issues mentioned in the emerging literature. We review significant opportunities for the U.S. dairy sector to reduce emissions, particularly through improved enteric fermentation and manure management practices. Additionally, we cover the potential for mitigating indirect emissions from feed production, processing, and transportation, areas less frequently covered in existing studies. This review also covers a gap in the literature by integrating economic findings including cost analysis and incentives to mitigate based on the social value of emissions reductions.</description>

                Cu-catalyzed electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to multi-carbon (C2+) products is often plagued by low selectivity because the adsorption energies of different reaction intermediates are in a linear scaling relationship. Development of Cu-based bimetallic catalysts has been considered as an attractive strategy to address this issue; however, conventional bimetallic catalysts often avoid metals with strong CO adsorption energies to prevent surface poisoning. Herein, we demonstrated that limiting the amount of Co in CuCo bimetallic catalysts can enhance C2+ product selectivity. Specifically, we synthesized a series of CuCox catalysts with trace amounts of Co (0.07-1.8 at%) decorated on the surface of Cu nanowires using a simple dip coating method. Our results revealed a volcano-shaped correlation between Co loading and C2+ selectivity, with the CuCo0.4% catalyst exhibiting a 2-fold increase in C2+ selectivity compared to the Cu nanowire sample. In situ Raman and Infrared spectroscopies suggested that an optimal amount of Co could stabilize the Cu oxide/hydroxide species under the CO2RR condition and promote the adsorption of CO, thus enhancing the C2+ selectivity. This work expands the potential for developing Cu-based bimetallic catalysts for CO2RR.</description>

                Abstract Urbanisation processes contribute to an increase in the level of harmful emissions in cities, which significantly increases the relevance of sustainable inclusive development based on the principles of decarbonisation and the transition to zero-emission cities. The purpose of the study is to summarise the global experience of implementing sustainable urban development programmes and their transition to zero-emission cities and to develop proposals for its implementation in the substantiation of urban development programmes in Ukraine. The study is based on a system of methods that includes conceptual approaches to sustainable inclusive development based on a balanced approach, generalisation of global digital trends in the transition of cities to zero CO2 emissions, practical results of decarbonisation projects and identification of indicators for their achievement. In the context of the formation of &#8220;smart&#8221; city strategies in Ukraine, the current areas of decarbonisation of urban development, based on the feasibility and limited funding, are optimisation of urban traffic, creation of &#8220;green&#8221; zones with zero emissions, implementation of a set of measures and introduction of renewable energy, promotion of projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in construction, including their reduction at all stages of the life cycle of buildings, as well as the implementation of a &#8220;smart&#8221; waste management system Based on a synthesis of international experience, the study outlines the basic indicators for achieving decarbonisation goals, which can be used in the future to substantiate sustainable development strategies for Ukrainian cities.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Fire Safety of Energy-Saving Foam by Self-Cleavage CO2 Pre-Combustion and Phosphorus Release Post-Combustion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29153708</link>
      <description>Fengyun Sun, Li Wang, Tingting Gao, Yuanyuan Zhong, Kefa Ren, Molecules. 29(15)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401323812

                Rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF) is widely utilized in construction and rail transportation due to its lightweight properties and low thermal conductivity, contributing to energy conservation and emission reduction. However, the inherent flammability of RPUF presents significant challenges. Delaying the time to ignition and preventing flame spread post-combustion is crucial for ensuring sufficient evacuation time in the event of a fire. Based on this principle, this study explores the efficacy of using potassium salts as a catalyst to promote the self-cleavage of RPUF, generating substantial amounts of CO2, thereby reducing the local oxygen concentration and delaying ignition. Additionally, the inclusion of a reactive flame retardant (DFD) facilitates the release of phosphorus-oxygen free radicals during combustion, disrupting the combustion chain reaction and thus mitigating flame propagation. Moreover, potassium salt-induced catalytic carbonization and phosphorus derivative cross-linking enhance the condensed phase flame retardancy. Consequently, the combined application of potassium salts and DFD increases the limiting oxygen index (LOI) and reduces both peak heat release rate (PHRR) and total heat release (THR). Importantly, the incorporation of these additives does not compromise the compressive strength or thermal insulation performance of RPUF. This integrated approach offers a new and effective strategy for the development of flame retardant RPUF.</description>

      <title>LCA Operational Carbon Reduction Based on Energy Strategies Analysis in a Mass Timber Building</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16156579</link>
      <description>Moein Hemmati, Tahar Messadi, Hongmei Gu, Mahboobeh Hemmati, Sustainability. 16(15)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401219155

                Buildings play a significant role in the rise of energy consumption and carbon emissions. Building operations are responsible for 28% of the world&#8217;s carbon emissions. It is crucial, therefore, to evaluate the environmental impact of various buildings&#8217; operational phase in order to implement sustainable strategies for the mitigation of their energy usage and associated carbon footprint. While numerous studies have been conducted to determine the carbon footprint of conventional building operation phases, there are still a lack of actual data on the operational carbon (OC) emissions of mass timber buildings. There is also a lack of research pertaining to the operational carbon of buildings within larger campuses and their inherent energy usage. This study, therefore, aims to quantify empirical data on the carbon footprint of a mass timber building, using, as a case study, the recent Adohi Hall building, situated at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. The study also aims to examine and identify the best energy use scenarios for the campus building under consideration. The research team obtained data on Adohi Hall&#8217;s energy consumption, fuel input usage, and other utilities (such as water, electricity, chilled water, and natural gas) accounting for the operation of the building from 2021 to 2023, a span of three years. The University of Arkansas Facilities Management (FAMA) provided the data. The study relies on the life cycle assessment (LCA) as its primary approach, with SimaPro 9, Ecoinvent v3.7 database, DataSmart, version 2023.1 and the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory (USLCI) database utilized to model the energy and water consumption of Adohi Hall during the operational phase (B6 &amp; B7). The results indicate 4496 kg CO2 eq emissions associated with the operation per square meter of Adohi Hall over its 50-year lifespan. The study also examines various scenarios of fuel sources leading to carbon emissions and provides insights into reduction strategies during the operational phase of buildings. Among them, the electricity based on a cleaner fuel source diversification, according to realistic expectations and technological advancements projections, results in a 17% reduction in Adohi Hall&#8217;s OC. Due to the usage of the combined heat and power (CHP) plant on the campus of the University of Arkansas as a complementary source of electricity and heating for Adohi Hall, the resulting carbon emission is approximately 21% (20.73%) less when compared to similar buildings in the same city but outside the campus. The study, therefore, reveals that CHP plant development is a highly effective strategy for building OC reduction.</description>

      <title>Changes in the Properties of Green Concrete Due to an Acidic Environment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.18517/ijaseit.14.4.17495</link>
      <description>Irma Aswani Ahmad, Noor Fadilah Romadhani, Muhammad Idhil Maming, International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering and Information Technology. 14(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401300351

                The problem in this research is the negative environmental impact of cement production and the decrease in concrete durability due to acid rain. This research aims to create an equation for the relationship between concrete's mechanical properties and the concrete's age in an acidic environment. This equation is used to predict the quality of green concrete produced according to the mix design and to measure the reduction in strength of green concrete in an acidic environment. The method used is experimental research with wet-dry acid rain simulations (a mixture of sulfuric acid and nitric acid solutions) in the laboratory using rice husk ash (RHA) as a cement substitute. This research uses 5% and 10% of RHA variations of cement weight and immersion in pH3 and pH4 acid solutions. The results showed that adding 5% RHA increased the compressive and flexural strength of concrete, both in normal and acidic environments, with a significant increase in concrete life up to 120 days. However, the addition of 10% RHA showed decreased performance in acidic environments, although it still provided benefits under normal conditions. The potential environmental and sustainability benefits of using RHA as a cement substitute are significant, as it can reduce CO2 emissions, overcome waste disposal problems, and increase the durability of green concrete in acidic environments. This finding provides an environmentally friendly and sustainable solution for the construction industry, especially in areas vulnerable to acidic environments (acid rain).</description>

                The wide metabolic diversity of microalgae, their fast growth rates, and low-cost production make these organisms highly promising resources for a variety of biotechnological applications, addressing critical needs in industry, agriculture, and medicine. The use of microalgae in consortia with bacteria is proving valuable in several areas of biotechnology, including the treatment of various types of wastewater, the production of biofertilizers, and the extraction of various products from their biomass. The monoculture of the microalga Chlamydomonas has been a prominent research model for many years and has been extensively used in the study of photosynthesis, sulphur and phosphorus metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, respiration, and flagellar synthesis, among others. Recent research has increasingly recognised the potential of Chlamydomonas&#8211;bacteria consortia as a biotechnological tool for various applications. The detoxification of wastewater using Chlamydomonas and its bacterial consortia offers significant potential for sustainable reduction of contaminants, while facilitating resource recovery and the valorisation of microalgal biomass. The use of Chlamydomonas and its bacterial consortia as biofertilizers can offer several benefits, such as increasing crop yields, protecting crops, maintaining soil fertility and stability, contributing to CO2 mitigation, and contributing to sustainable agricultural practises. Chlamydomonas&#8211;bacterial consortia play an important role in the production of high-value products, particularly in the production of biofuels and the enhancement of H2 production. This review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential of Chlamydomonas monoculture and its bacterial consortia to identify current applications and to propose new research and development directions to maximise their potential.</description>

                The co-pyrolysis of biomass and polymeric wastes offers a promising approach for waste reduction and valuable product recovery while decreasing fossil fuel dependence. This study aimed to investigate the synergistic effects of blending waste tire (WT) or polystyrene (PS) with sawdust (SD) at varying effective hydrogen/carbon ratio (H/Ceff) on liquid product distribution. Thermal degradation behavior was analyzed using TGA-FTIR, followed by fixed-bed reactor pyrolysis experiments at different temperatures. The devolatilization of SD primarily occurred between 185 and 390&#176;C, while WT and PS decomposed between 250-500&#176;C and 350-460&#176;C, respectively. Results showed that SD addition to WT accelerated degradation at lower temperatures. Optimal H/Ceff ratios were 0.42 for WT/SD and 0.64 for PS/SD blends at 500&#176;C, maximizing valued hydrocarbons, reducing pollutants, and yielding the highest liquid fraction. TGA-FTIR analysis revealed the presence of various functional groups, including C-H, C=C, CO2, and O-H. The pyrolytic oil showed improved stability with significantly fewer undesired compounds. This research provides theoretical and practical insights into the control and application potential as well as the limitations of high-value energy products derived from the co-pyrolysis of SD, WT, and PS.</description>

      <title>Nano Technolgy Application to Enhance the Emission Control by Using Activated Carbons Modified by Magnesium Oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.52783/jes.4547</link>

                One of the fundamental processes for planet safety is the catalytic conversion of carbon monoxide (CO). CO has even been named one of the unseen toxins of this century. Inhaling CO can lead to hypoxic damage, neurological break, and even death. CO poisoning decays greenery life and accumulations in global warming and ozone layer depletion. CO is created in the atmosphere by the partial oxidation of carbon-containing mixtures. The primary origin of CO emissions is vehicles. Therefore, oxidizing contaminated CO to nonpoisonous CO2 under ambient conditions is essential for life protection in multiple applications. Additionally, low-temperature CO oxidation is crucial in reducing emissions at the cold start of an internal explosion in the engine. For controlling pollution, the available methods are pre-pollution control and post-pollution. This project depends on the post-pollution control method in Peugeot ROA automobiles using Activated Carbons Modified by Magnesium Oxide as a catalyst. An innovative catalytic converter design activated carbons modified by magnesium oxide nanoparticles as a catalyst to control pollution with different NPs lodgings and carbon structures. This proposed method aims for the reduction environmental pollution contributed by automobiles. It involves using more affordable materials than the existing rhodium nanoparticles, platinum, and palladium technique. The dispersion states of the grafted nanoparticles were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), confirming the correlation between high grafted ratio states and improved properties. The nanocomposites' desired properties were significantly enhanced when the graft density was high.</description>

      <title>Investigation of modal integration for transit-access trips in motorcycle dependent cities&#8212;The case study of Hanoi, Vietnam</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.24294/jipd.v8i8.5351</link>
      <description>Khuat Viet Hung, An Minh Ngoc, Hoang Huu Thanh, Journal of Infrastructure Policy and Development. 8(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401317410

                Micro-mobility has the potential to address first -mile challenges, improving transit accessibility and encouraging public transit usage. However, users&#8217; acceptability of modal integration between various micro-mobility options and public transit remains largely unexplored in the literature. Our study investigates the user behavior for first-mile options, focusing on four alternatives: walking, bicycling, motorcycling, and bus, to access urban mass rapid transit (UMRT) in Hanoi, Vietnam. Based on data collected from 1380 individuals, a Nested Logit Model (NLM) was proposed to analyze the determinants of users&#8217; acceptability under each access mode option as well as evaluate further impacts of shifts in access mode choice on vehicle-kilometer traveled and emissions. The analysis shows that the availability of access modes might increase UMRT use by 47.83%. While this increase further generates additional vehicle-kilometer traveled due to the increase in park-and-ride users, this is offset overall by the large number of motorcycle users shifting to UMRT. Under the most optimistic scenario, modal integration for transit-access trips leads to an average reduction of 17.7% in net vehicle-kilometer traveled or 14.5% in net CO2 emissions or 10.9% in NOx from private vehicles. Our findings also imply that the introduction of parking fees for bicycling- or motorcycling-access trips, while impactful, does not significantly change UMRT choice. Therefore, the pricing schemes should be a focus of parking planning surrounding stations. Finally, a number of policy suggestions for parking planning and first-mile vehicles are presented.</description>

      <title>GHG Policies in Maritime Transport: A Comparative Analysis using Cost-Effectiveness and Multi-Criteria Analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4855186/v1</link>
      <description>R. Garcia, Cristiane Elia de Marsillac, Paula Carvalho Pereda, Andrea Lucchesi, Jean-David Caprace, Research Square (Research Square). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401407908

                Abstract Maritime transport accounts for approximately 3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the sector aiming to achieve net zero by or around i.e. close 2050. There has been intense debate on medium-term measures that combine regulatory frameworks with financial incentives or economic penalties. Among the main proposals under discussion are a GHG levy, two flexible mechanisms (FCMs) based on the GHG Fuel Intensity (GFI) and a feebate. Despite extensive discussions on carbon levies, there is a notable lack of studies comparing the cost-effectiveness of these different GHG reduction measures in the maritime sector. This study aims to fill this gap by developing a comprehensive methodology to evaluate and compare these GHG policies. Using cost-effectiveness and multi-criterion decision analysis (MCDA), the study assesses the technical feasibility, economic implications, and environmental benefits of the proposed measures. The main quantitative results reveal that a GHG levy starting at $100 per ton of CO2 doubles fuel costs, while new fuels become economically attractive only after 2040 under the feebate mechanism. Both original and revised FCM proposals show similar cost patterns, with the revised FCM leading to earlier adoption of new fuels. We find that the FCMs and the carbon levy are effective in achieving the IMO's final and intermediate targets. However, FCMs are the most cost-effective proposals, achieving targets with the lowest present value of costs and the cost per avoided GHG emissions. The proposed methodology provides a robust framework for facilitating objective and structured discussions with stakeholders, helping to balance economic and environmental goals in maritime policymaking.</description>

                In order to reveal the migration and evolution of gas molecules in the actual oil&#8211;paper insulation composite system of transformer from the molecular level, the diffusion behavior of seven gas molecules (H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6) generated during the operation and aging of oil-immersed transformers in the oil&#8211;paper composite insulation system is studied by molecular dynamics. Firstly, based on the molecular dynamics software, the model of the oil&#8211;paper composite insulation system and the gas molecule model is constructed. In order to compare and analyze the diffusion properties of gas molecules in a single medium, a single model of insulating oil and cellulose is also constructed. Then, the diffusion coefficients of gas molecules in the insulating oil, cellulose, and oil&#8211;paper insulating composite system are simulated and calculated. And the differences in the diffusion properties of gas molecules in the three insulating mediums are discussed. Finally, the microscopic mechanism of diffusion of different gas molecules in the three mediums is analyzed. The simulation results show that among the three mediums, the diffusion coefficient of H2 is the largest, while the diffusion coefficients of the other gas molecules are not very different. The diffusion coefficients of the seven gas molecules are the smallest in the oil-immersed paper composite insulation system, followed by cellulose, while the diffusion coefficients are the largest in mineral oil. It indicates that the diffusion of gas molecules is inhibited in oil&#8211;paper insulation systems where the insulating paper is completely immersed in oil. This is mainly due to the fact that the insulating oil completely penetrates into the paper, filling the pores and voids between the fibers, resulting in a reduction in the transition vacancies of the intermediate gas molecules, which hinders the diffusion of the gas molecules.</description>

                Abstract. The high-resolution ship emission inventory serves as a crucial dataset for various disciplines including atmospheric science, marine science, environmental management, etc. Here, we present a global high spatiotemporal resolution ship emission inventory at a resolution of 0.1&#176; &#215; 0.1&#176; for the years 2013, 2016&#8211;2021, generated by the state-of-the-art Shipping Emission Inventory Model (SEIMv2.2). Initially, the annual 30 billion Automatic Identification System (AIS) data underwent extensive cleaning to ensure data validity and accuracy in temporal and spatial distribution. Subsequently, integrating real-time vessel positions and speeds from AIS data with static technical parameters, emission factors, and other computational parameters, SEIM simulated ship emissions on a ship-by-ship, signal-by-signal basis. Finally, the results were aggregated and analyzed. In 2021, the ship activity dataset established based on AIS data covered 109.3 thousand vessels globally (101.4 thousand vessels reported by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). Concerning the major air pollutants and greenhouse gases, global ships emitted 847.2 million tons of CO2, 2.3 million tons of SO2, 16.1 million tons of NOx, 791.2 kilo tons of CO, 737.3 kilo tons of HC, 415.5 kilo tons of primary PM2.5, 61.6 kilo tons of BC, 210.3 kilo tons of CH4, 45.1 kilo tons of N2O in 2021, accounting for 3.2 % of SO2, 14.2 % of NOx, and 2.3 % of CO2 emissions from all global anthropogenic sources, based on the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS). Due to the implementation of fuel-switching policies, global ship emissions of SO2 and primary PM2.5 saw a significant reduction of 81.3 % and 76.5 % in 2021 compared to 2019, respectively. According to the inventory results, the composition of vessel types contributing to global ship emissions remained relatively stable through the years, with container ships consistently contributing ~ 30 % of global ship emissions. Regarding vessel age distribution, the emission contribution of vessels built before 2000 (without Tier standard) has been declining, dropping to 10.2 % in 2021, suggesting that even a complete phase-out of these vessels would have limited potential for reducing NOx emissions in the short term. On the other hand, the emission contribution of vessels built after 2016 (meeting Tier III standard) kept increasing, reaching 13.3 % in 2021. Temporally, global ship emissions exhibited minimal daily fluctuations. Spatially, high-resolution emission characteristics of different vessel types were delineated. Patterns of ship emission contributions by different types of vessels vary among maritime regions, with container ships predominant in the North and South Pacific, bulk carriers predominant in the South Atlantic, and oil tankers prevalent in the Arabian Sea. The distribution characteristics of ship emissions and intensity also vary significantly across different maritime regions. Our dataset, which is accessible at https://zenodo.org/records/11069531 (Wen et al., 2024), provides daily breakdown by vessel type and age is available for broad research purposes, and it will provide a solid data foundation for fine-scale scientific research and shipping emission mitigation.</description>

      <title>The Potential For Ch4-enriched Biogas As A Transport Fuel In Ireland</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.34719/vrkk7758</link>
      <description>Niamh Power, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401364246

                "Ireland needs a biofuel industry- to aid compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, the Biofuels Directive and to secure its energ&gt;' supply. The overall aim of this work is to assess the potential of CH4-enriched biogas as a transport fuel in Ireland. Biogas is produced during the anaerobic digestion of biomass. This work investigates biogas production from two different feedstocks; biodegradable municipal waste and agricultural crops. To assess the potential for biogas as a transport fuel the alternatives to biogas are investigated and compared. Thus digestion and composting of biodegradable municipal waste, and biogas and ethanol production from agricultural crops arc investigated on a technical, economic and environmental basis. Ireland is facing a waste crisis; municipal waste production has grown at a significant rate over the last number of years; to compound this problem the Landfill Directive requires a reduction in the quantity of biodegradable municipal waste consigned to landfill. This thesis compares composting to anaerobic digestion with biogas utilisation as a transport fuel. The composting model is based on two weeks in-vessel composting followed by eight to ten weeks aerated static pile composting. The anaerobic digestion model is based on a dry digestion process, followed by water absorption for biogas upgrading, and biogas compression. At present biogas is not subjected to excise duty; if this situation remains then biogas is economically preferable to composting when treating more than 18,000 t/a (which equates to the waste produced by 80,000 people). However, if excise duty were applied to biogas, then composting is economically preferable when treating less than 48,000 t/a. The area of land that is available for energy crops was examined. Crops for energy production can be grown on set-aside land and land previously under sugar beet without affecting food production. Currently there are three main crops in Ireland; wheat, barley and sugar beet. Biogas production from these crops is investigated for various rotations, however in addition to biogas these crops can also be used for ethanol production. Thus biogas from these crops is in direct competition with ethanol; consequently biogas and ethanol are compared. On a technical basis it was found that biogas produces more energy per hectare than ethanol. It was also found that a crop rotation of wheat, wheat and sugar beet is preferable in terms of energy production for both biogas and ethanol production. On an economic basis, biogas is preferable to ethanol when compared per unit of energy&#8217;. On an environmental basis ethanol saves more CO2 than biogas; this is due to present documented levels of leakage of methane at the biogas facilities. If biogas losses were reduced to between 3.4-4.4% then biogas saves more CO2 than ethanol. Overall this work shows that biogas from biodegradable municipal waste and agricultural crops on 48,000 ha of land previously under sugar beet and set aside can replace up to 3.3% of petroleum fuels in 2010. Biogas on its own will not enable Ireland to comply with the Biofuels Directive but can aid Ireland if used in a combined approach with other renew able fuels and biogas from different sources."</description>

      <title>The Beneficial Effects of Fruits and Vegetables on Kidney Disease Progression and Cardiovascular Disease Risk</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2024.07.029</link>

                Chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease are common causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. In addition to pharmacologic therapy, dietary modification is an important strategy to mitigate disease progression. Diets rich in fruits and vegetable, such as the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet, the Mediterranean Diet, and vegan diets, have been shown to attenuate the risk of progressive chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease through a variety of mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Evidence suggests that these diets are high in potassium, which is an important dietary factor for blood pressure reduction, and high in magnesium which has been shown to lower the production of inflammatory and proatherogenic cytokines in endothelial cells2Morales-Alvarez M. et al.Effects of Reduced Dietary Sodium and the DASH Diet on GFR: The DASH-sodium trial.Kidney360. 2024; 5: 569-576Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar. Furthermore, diets high in fruits and vegetables have a reduced dietary acid load and provide a net alkalizing effect through its potassium, magnesium, and calcium content, which is in contrast to high acid diets, such as the typical Western diet or diets high in animal protein that have been shown to provide a net acidifying effect through its generation of hydrogen ions from phosphorus and protein3Noce A. et al.Nutritional Approaches for the Management of Metabolic Acidosis in Chronic Kidney Disease.Nutrients. 2021; 13: 2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar. High animal protein diets impose their adverse effects to the kidney through tubular toxicity from elevated ammonium concentration and activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and through the alternative complement pathway4Banerjee T. et al.High Dietary Acid Load Predicts ESRD among Adults with CKD.Journal of the American Association of Nephrology. 2015; 26: 1693-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar. In this issue of AJM, Goraya and colleagues report the benefit of diets high in fruits and vegetables on chronic kidney disease progression, blood pressure control, and indices of cardiovascular disease risk in a primary hypertension patient population. They describe a randomized control trial of 153 ambulatory patients 18-70 years of age with macroalbuminuria defined as urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio &gt;200mg/g without diabetes, no known cardiovascular (CV) disease but at increased risk of developing CV disease due to having macroalbuminuria, normal plasma CO2 level, and normal kidney function to evaluate kidney disease progression and cardiovascular disease risk indices over five years. This patient population was selected as they had no known cardiovascular disease but were at increased risk and therefore had the greatest potential to benefit from dietary modification. The authors randomized ambulatory patients with hypertension in a 1:1:1 ratio to fruits and vegetables, sodium bicarbonate tablets to match the alkali content of the fruits and vegetables group, or to usual care with 51 patients in each of the three groups. All individuals received guideline-directed therapy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (enalapril) and statin therapy (atorvastatin) as tolerated by patients. The investigators found that when compared to usual care both the fruit and vegetable group and oral sodium bicarbonate group resulted in a statistically significant reduction in albuminuria and slower decline in eGFR. These reductions occurred as early as year 2 in this five year study with the degree of albuminuria reduction as high as 33mg/g and the range of eGFR decline of 4.78-6.03ml/min/1.73m2 compared to 8.6-10.8ml/min/1.73m2 in the usual care group. The greatest reduction in CV disease risk indices of systolic blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, Lp(a) cholesterol, and BMI occurred in the fruits and vegetables group compared to both the usual care and the oral sodium bicarbonate groups. Clinically, these changes were equivalent to roughly 5mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure, 6mg/dl reduction in LDL cholesterol, 3mg/dl reduction in Lp(a) cholesterol, and 1kg/m2 reduction in BMI when compared to enalapril and atorvastatin alone. The authors showed that median doses of antihypertensive medications and statins were lower in the fruits and vegetables group compared to the usual care group. Therefore, fruits and vegetables showed an added benefit to usual care. This study was a remarkable achievement in the way in which it was conducted, the limitation in resources available, and the diverse study population recruited. It took 10 years to enroll the necessary sample size of individuals that uniquely had hypertension, macroalbuminuria without diabetes, and normal kidney function with an estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt;90ml/min/1.73m2. Also, it enrolled a study population of 47% African American individuals which can be difficult to achieve in clinical trials. The large number of African Americans in the study cohort speaks to the trial's ability to generalize to a diverse patient population and speaks to the potential success of a dietary intervention in minority populations who are at risk of having limited resources and poor access to medical care. Furthermore, it provides a rationale for more dietary intervention studies in populations who would otherwise be skeptical of traditional pharmacologic care. This is the first interventional, randomized control trial that compared the alkali producing potential of fruits and vegetables against oral sodium bicarbonate therapy and its effect on kidney disease progression and cardiovascular disease risk in a patient population with normal kidney function. Furthermore, it shows that fruits and vegetables are an added benefit to usual care, and it provides the foundational support for routine assessment of albuminuria in a primary hypertension patient population. This study compliments a similar study by the authors that investigated similar parameters in a CKD Stage 3 population (eGFR 30-59ml/min/1.73m2), not a population with normal kidney function as this study, where similar results were reported, thus signifying an enduring benefit of fruit and vegetable consumption on kidney disease progression and cardiovascular disease risk5Goraya N. et al.Fruits and Vegetable Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease-Related Metabolic Acidosis Reduces Cardiovascular Risk Better than Sodium Bicarbonate.American Journal of Nephrology. 2019; 49: 438-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar. Compared to the authors' previous study, this current study was conducted in a larger patient cohort but with similar numbers of African American and Hispanic individuals. Also, outcomes in the current study were investigated equally as compared to the previous study where outcomes were delineated as primary (eGFR change) versus secondary (urinary excretion of kidney injury parameters, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and plasma levels of cholesterol), making the cardiovascular disease risk indices in this current study more robust. This study highlights the benefits of fruits and vegetables on cardiovascular and renal indices while also showcasing the continued limitations of delivering healthy foods and sustaining a dietary intervention, particularly in marginalized communities. The authors describe a significant investment of time and resources to retain this study cohort as this unique patient population makes up less than 1% of patients with primary hypertension and comprises a small number of individuals from which to recruit. Additionally, these patients were almost 50% African American, which undoubtedly made retention efforts different than what would be necessary for non-minority communities. As such, this study not only speaks to the willingness and engagement of minority communities in a dietary intervention but also further highlights the need for systemic change to make fruits and vegetables more widely available for all communities given that this study adds more evidence to support the need for fruit and vegetable intake in the management of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. Policy initiatives to include eliminating food deserts, creating subsidies or vouchers for fruits and vegetables, incentivizing community gardens, engaging community and civic organizations, and combining reductions in insurance premiums with increased consumption of fruits and vegetables are all areas to consider for practical implementation and for overcoming the barrier this dietary change would create. There are a few study limitations the authors cite. For example, the investigators describe a lack of specific data on adherence with sodium bicarbonate therapy as a major limitation of the study. Other limitations include a lack of data on differences in dietary sodium intake that could either contribute or attenuate the study results. Also, there is a lack of confirmation of the prespecified amount of fruits and vegetables consumed, although they did show that plasma total CO2 levels and plasma bicarbonate concentrations were higher in the sodium bicarbonate therapy and fruits and vegetable groups. Future studies could further test these findings in larger patient populations and further unravel the mechanisms of how high dietary fruit and vegetable intake attenuate the risk of kidney disease and cardiovascular disease progression. Furthermore, future studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow up periods could determine if high fruit and vegetable consumption decrease cardiovascular events and outcomes. 1Appel L.

      <title>Morphological and Physiological Response of Maize (Zea mays L.) to Drought Stress during Reproductive Stage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy14081718</link>
      <description>Sitti Maryam Yasin, Francisco Zavala&#8208;Garc&#237;a, Guillermo Ni&#241;o&#8208;Medina, Pablo Al&#225;n Rodr&#237;guez-Salinas, Adriana Guti&#233;rrez-D&#237;ez, Sugey Ramona Sinagawa-Garc&#237;a, Eleazar Lugo-Cruz, Agronomy. 14(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401337615

                Maize is among the most significant crops in the world regarding production and yield, but it is highly sensitive to drought, which reduces the growth, photosynthetic efficiency, grain quality, and yield production of a plant. Quantum yield efficiency of photosystem II is a critical photosynthetic component that is susceptible to drought stress. This study intended to investigate the effects of drought stress on growth and morpho-physiological parameters using three maize hybrids (&#8216;P-3011w&#8217;, &#8216;P-3092&#8217; and &#8216;iku20&#8217;) with contrasting soil moisture contents (100%, 40%) at the pre-flowering stage. The stress treatment (40%) was initiated at stage V7, for a period of 15 days; the experimental units were established in a completely randomized design with split-plot arrangement along with three repetitions in 42 L pots using a substrate of peat moss, black soil and poultry manure (1:2:1). The morphological, growth-related and physiological parameters were assessed, including chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm), which was measured using a LiCor-6400-40 fluorometer. The results showed that all morphological, growth-related and physiological variables decreased under drought stress during the reproductive stage, with the exception of leaf temperature and intercellular CO2 concentration, which increased by 12% and 54%, respectively. Drought stress significantly reduced the photosynthetic chlorophyll fluorescence (43%), due to damage to photosystem II. The lowest percentage of damage to photosystem II (34%) was observed in the iku20 genotype. In contrast, P-3011w and P-3092 had the highest levels of significantly similar damage (49% and 46%, respectively). The correlation analysis showed a highly positive interaction of chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) with net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance under drought conditions, and multiple regression analysis revealed that the maximum effect on net photosynthetic rate under drought was due to the damage it caused to photosystem II. Thus, iku20 might have a tendency to be able to withstand drought stress in the dry northeast region of Mexico. Overall, we concluded that the photosystem II was negatively impacted by drought stress thus causing a reduction in all physiological, morphological and growth-related variables.</description>

                Affordable energy resources of energy play a crucial role in economic and social development to support food production, availability of water supply and sustainable healty lifestyle. In order to avoid long-term scarcity resulting from the continuous use of non-renewable energy sources, we must explore all potential renewable energy source that align with concernes about climate change and other environmental issues. As a continuation of the Indonesian government&#8217;s efforts to generate clean and environmental friendly energy, PT Pertamina Geothermal Energy (PGE) was established in 2006. It has contributed 82% of the installed geothermal energy capacity in Indonesia. By leveraging Indonesia&#8217;s location within the Ring of Fire as one of the world&#8217;s geothermal energy hubs, PGE has been supplying electricity to more than 2 million households in Indonesia with a potential emission reduction of 9.7 million tons of CO2 per year. To achieve sustainable business growth, PGEO is optimizing production in its operational areas by expanding installed capacity. In the company consideration, IPO is an appropriate step to financing the expansion. The author compares the company&#8217;s value before and after the IPO to determine the short-term impact of the IPO, helping investors gauge their confidence in making investment decisions in PGEO. This study utilizes secondary data from prospectuses, financial statements, annual reports, sustainability reports, company-published documents, as well as data from IDX.co.id and IDN Financials.com. The data was collected and analyzed to understand evaluate financial performance, and assess the company&#8217;s value before and after the IPO. The calculation of the company&#8217;s intrinsic value is conducted using the Discounted Cash Flow Valuation method for the pre-IPO period against the company&#8217;s financial projections for the years 2019 to 2022 and for the post-IPO period against the company&#8217;s financial projections for the years 2024 to 2028, using discount rates of 8.25% and 8.65% for each. In resulting the intrinsic value pre-IPO is IDR 1.141,28 and the intrinsic value post-IPO is IDR 1.300,86. The stock price of PGEO at its IPO on February 23, 2023, was IDR 875, while the adjusted closing price on December 29, 2023, was IDR 1,170. This study founds that the market price of PGEO&#8217;s stock, both before and after the IPO, are overvalued.</description>

                This year&#8217;s Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) Technical Focus feature showcases industry advancements in sustainability practices through use of new digital technologies and circular economy, decarbonization, ecosystem, and biodiversity principles. Paper OTC 35396 graphically describes a holistic approach for industrial systems by strategic (outer) and operational (inner) circles integrating cybersecurity with process safety and human factors. Information technology, operations technology, and engineering technology converge to provide advanced opportunities for risk analysis, protection of critical systems, resilience of production systems, and personal and environmental safety, resulting in an integrated incident response. Paper SPE 216385 presents how, as part of a strategy to advance environmental excellence, a national oil company implemented sustainable and circular decarbonization, ecosystem, and biodiversity initiatives at Abu Ali Island, Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia. The initiatives include development of mangrove nurseries and plantation campaigns, construction of the Abu Ali Fish Hatchery, repurposing 34 km of old subsea pipelines to become coral reef habitats, rerouting treated sewage water to an irrigation system, converting food waste to compost to be used as fertilizer for agriculture, and continuous beach-cleaning campaigns. These actions promote the company&#8217;s sustainability focus areas of climate change and energy transition, safe operations, and people development, thereby minimizing environmental impact and growing societal value. Paper SPE 216338 describes how an operator implemented a new culture of circular decommissioning by applying the 3R circular economy principle&#8212;reuse, recycle, and reduce&#8212;during engineering and decommissioning of projects. To achieve asset-value maximization and CO2 footprint reduction, preused assets are reused for new projects and designs are created for long-life assets, products, and components. Modules and components are standardized to enable reuse and cost effectiveness, and assets and portions of assets are designed for reuse. This multiyear journey of the company&#8217;s new circular decommissioning culture begins with attention to its most-mature assets. Many more examples of recent notable achievements in HSE can be found in the OnePetro online library or presented through local SPE section meetings, SPE Live, webinars, workshops, and distinguished lectures. Knowledge sharing, on the local and global levels, encourages collaboration and solutions generation. Recommended additional reading at OnePetro: www.onepetro.org.

Quantitative assessments of the carbon balance of terrestrial landscapes and, specifically the permafrost zone, where the most significant warming trends are observed, require taking into account the export of terrigenous carbon beyond their boundaries with lateral flow. The paper presents the results of long-term monitoring of intraseasonal and interannual fluctuations in the concentrations of dissolved organic (DOC) and inorganic (DIC) carbon in the hydrographic network of the Central Siberian Plateau, carried out on the basis of the Evenkian field station of the V. N. Sukachev Institute of Forest, Siberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences (Tura settlement). Research is being carried out on more than 100 streams and rivers of various orders in the middle reaches of the Lower Tunguska River (62&#8211;66&#176;N, 96&#8211;102&#176;E) based on regular measurements of the concentrations of all forms of carbon, as well as quasi-continuous monitoring of the physical and chemical parameters using specific sensors and automatic loggers. It has been shown that the main limiting factors of lateral carbon flux within the Central Siberian Plateau at present are: 1) stocks of potentially mobilizeable organic carbon in terrestrial landscapes and 2) amount of precipitation in a sharply continental climate. An increase in the DOC flux is predicted both as a result of thawing of C-rich frozen deposits and an increase in the productivity of plant cover, and inorganic carbon &#8211; as a result of increased rates of silicate rock weathering and sequestration of atmospheric CO2. Negative predictions of DOC behaviour are associated with an increase in the depth of infiltration of solutes with an increase in the seasonally thawed soil layer, which determines the sorption of DOC in the soil column and its microbiological destruction. An increase in the area and intensity of fires as a result of climate warming determines a significant transformation of the lateral carbon flux. At the same time, the observed reduction in river flow as a result of an increase in the pyrogenic factor will determine the overall decrease in the transport of terrigenous carbon from terrestrial landscapes.</description>
