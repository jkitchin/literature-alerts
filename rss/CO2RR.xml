                Abstract Clarifying the formation mechanism of single&#8208;atom sites guides the design of emerging single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and facilitates the identification of the active sites at atomic scale. Herein, we develop a molten&#8208;salt atomization strategy for synthesizing zinc (Zn) SACs with temperature universality from 400 to 1000/1100 &#176;C and an evolved coordination from Zn&#8208;N 2 Cl 2 to Zn&#8208;N 4 . The electrochemical tests and in&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy confirm that the Zn&#8208;N 4 atomic sites are active for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) conversion to carbon monoxide (CO). In a strongly acidic medium (0.2 M K 2 SO 4 , pH&#176;=&#176;1), the Zn SAC formed at 1000 &#176;C (Zn 1 NC) containing Zn&#8208;N 4 sites enables highly selective CO 2 electroreduction to CO, with nearly 100% selectivity toward CO product in a wide current density range of 100 to 600 mA cm &#8722;2 . During a 50&#8208;h continuous electrolysis at the industrial current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 , Zn 1 NC achieves Faradaic efficiencies greater than 95% for CO product. Our work presents a temperature&#8208;universal formation of single&#8208;atom sites, which provides a novel platform for unraveling the active sites in Zn SACs for CO 2 electroreduction and extends the synthesis of SACs with controllable coordination sites.

      <title>Study of Ni-Co-ZrO2/Al2O3 Catalysts for Carbon Dioxide Reforming of Methane at Low CO2</title>

                This work studied the composition of Ni-Co-ZrO2/Al2O3 catalyst on properties and efficiency of catalysts for carbon dioxide reforming of methane (CMR) when CO2 was fed as the limiting reagent and CH4 as the excess reactant. 9wt%Ni-1wt%ZrO2/Al2O3, 4.5wt%Ni-4.5%wtCo-1wt%ZrO2/Al2O3, 9wt%Co-1wt%ZrO2/Al2O3 and 7wt%Co-3wt%ZrO2/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation method. The physicochemical properties of present catalysts were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption H2-TPR and CO2-TPD. The CRM performance was determined in a tubular fixed-bed reactor at 600 &#176;C for 6 h with limiting of carbon dioxide. The carbon deposition on spent catalysts were examined by TGA. The results showed that Co-ZrO2 catalysts provided greater activities, selectivity toward H2 and stability than Ni-ZrO2 and Ni-Co-ZrO2 catalysts. 9wt%Co-1wt%ZrO2/Al2O3 provided higher reactant conversions and H2/CO ratio than 7wt%Co-3wt%ZrO2/Al2O3 while the minimum coke formation was observed on spent 7wt%Co-3wt%ZrO2/Al2O3. It is because oxophilic properties and oxygen vacancy sites in Co-ZrO2 increase CO2 dissociative adsorption as well as oxygen transport on the catalyst surface. HIGHLIGHTS This work developed Ni-Co-ZrO2/Al2O3 catalysts for carbon dioxide reforming of methane (CMR) when CO2 is fed as the limiting reagent demonstrated petroleum refinery application. Remarkable points of this work are revealed below. Co-ZrO2 catalysts provided greater reactant activities, selectivity toward H2 and stability than Ni-ZrO2 and Ni-Co-ZrO2 The oxophilic property accompanied with oxygen vacancy sites in Co-ZrO2 increase CO2 dissociative absorption and oxygen transport on the catalyst surface. 9wt%Co-1wt%ZrO2/Al2O3 provided relative highest reactant conversions and highest H2/CO ratio. 7wt%Co-3wt%ZrO2/Al2O3 presented the minimum coke formation.

      <title>Chromium Complexes with Benzanellated N&#8208;heterocyclic Phosphenium Ligands &#8211; Synthesis, Reactivity and Application in Catalytic CO2 Reduction</title>

      <description>Nicholas Birchall, Fridolin Hennh&#246;fer, Martin Nieger, Dietrich Gudat, Chemistry. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399525034

                A chromium complex carrying two benzanellated N&#8208;heterocyclic phosphenium (bzNHP) ligands was prepared by a salt metathesis approach. Spectroscopic studies suggest that the anellation enhances the &#960;&#8208;acceptor ability of the NHP&#8208;units, which is confirmed by the facile electrochemical reduction of the complex to a spectroscopically characterized radical anion. Co&#8208;photolysis with H2 allowed extensive conversion into a &#963;&#8208;H2&#8208;complex, which shows a diverse reactivity towards donors and isomerizes under H&#8211;H bond fission and shift of a hydride to a P&#8208;ligand. The product carrying phosphenium, phosphine and hydride ligands was also synthesized independently and reacts reversibly with CO and MeCN to yield bis&#8208;phosphine complexes under concomitant Cr&#8208;to&#8208;P&#8208;shift of a hydride. In contrast, CO2 was not only bound but reduced to give an isolable formato complex, which reacted with ammonia borane under partial recovery of the metal hydride and production of formate. Further elaboration of the reactions of the chromium complexes with CO2 and NH3BH3 allowed to demonstrate the feasibility of a Cr&#8208;catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol. The various complexes described were characterized spectroscopically and in several cases by XRD studies. Further insights in reactivity patterns were provided through (spectro)electrochemical studies and DFT calculations.</description>

                The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to generate high&#8208;value products is considered to be a promising approach to reduce the atmospheric concentration of CO2. However, the pure CO2 gas is generally required in the most of the reported CO2RR system, which brings tedious capture and separation procedures and high cost. The utilization of realistic CO2 emission directly such as flue gas for the CO2RR is highly desirable. However, the gas impurities in the real CO2 sources such as oxygen could seriously affect the activity and selectivity of the CO2RR. This concept summarizes the recently reported works about CO2RR studies in the presence of O2 and highlights the physical and chemical strategies to boost CO2 electroreduction performance. We further discuss the implications of these strategies for future progress in this emerging field.</description>

                Abstract Emissions reduction and greenhouse gas removal from the atmosphere are both necessary to achieve net-zero emissions and limit climate change 1 . There is thus a need for improved sorbents for the capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, a process known as direct air capture. In particular, low-cost materials that can be regenerated at low temperatures would overcome the limitations of current technologies. In this work, we introduce a new class of designer sorbent materials known as &#8216;charged-sorbents&#8217;. These materials are prepared through a battery-like charging process that accumulates ions in the pores of low-cost activated carbons, with the inserted ions then serving as sites for carbon dioxide adsorption. We use our charging process to accumulate reactive hydroxide ions in the pores of a carbon electrode, and find that the resulting sorbent material can rapidly capture carbon dioxide from ambient air by means of (bi)carbonate formation. Unlike traditional bulk carbonates, charged-sorbent regeneration can be achieved at low temperatures (90&#8211;100 &#176;C) and the sorbent&#8217;s conductive nature permits direct Joule heating regeneration 2,3 using renewable electricity. Given their highly tailorable pore environments and low cost, we anticipate that charged-sorbents will find numerous potential applications in chemical separations, catalysis and beyond.</description>

                Abstract The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) is a promising approach for reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, allowing harmful CO 2 to be converted into more valuable carbon&#8208;based products. On one hand, single carbon (C 1 ) products have been obtained with high efficiency and show great promise for industrial CO 2 capture. However, multi&#8208;carbon (C 2+ ) products possess high market value and have demonstrated significant promise as potential products for CO 2 RR. Due to CO 2 RR's multiple pathways with similar equilibrium potentials, the extended reaction mechanisms necessary to form C 2+ products continue to reduce the overall selectivity of CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;C 2+ electroconversion. Meanwhile, CO 2 RR as a whole faces many challenges relating to system optimization, owing to an intolerance for low surface pH, systemic stability and utilization issues, and a competing side reaction in the form of the H 2 evolution reaction (HER). Ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) remains incredibly valuable within the chemical industry; however, the current established method for producing ethylene (steam cracking) contributes to the emission of CO 2 into the atmosphere. Thus, strategies to significantly increase the efficiency of this technology are essential. This review will discuss the vital factors influencing CO 2 RR in forming C 2 H 4 products and summarize the recent advancements in ethylene electrosynthesis.</description>

                Determining electrocatalytic activity for reactions that involve reactants with limited solubility presents a significant challenge due to the reduced mass-transport to the electrocatalyst surface. This limitation is seen in important reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. We introduce a new approach, which we call scanning bubble electrochemical microscopy, to enable the detection and high-resolution mapping of electrocatalytic activity with low-solubility reactants at high mass-transport rates. Using a scanning probe approach, a dual-barreled nanopipette is used to precisely deliver the gas-phase reactant within micrometers of an electrocatalyst surface, which results in high mass-transport rates at the electrocatalyst surface directly under the probe. We demonstrate the scanning bubble electrochemical microscopy approach by mapping the oxygen reduction reaction on model platinum microelectrode surfaces. We anticipate that scanning bubble electrochemical microscopy will provide an effective tool for measuring the electrocatalytic activity of reactants that have limited solubility.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the effect of the accountability audit of natural resources on carbon emissions reduction in China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1342321</link>
      <description>Liyang Xiong, Yiyi Shu, Xuefeng Li, Frontiers in environmental science. 12(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399524116

                The accountability audit of natural resources (AANR) is a major institutional arrangement for advancing the construction of an ecological civilization in China. Based on the panel data of 271 cities in China from 2005 to 2017, this paper investigates the relationship between the AANR and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions using a multi-period difference-in-differences (DID) model. The results show that AANR significantly increases the CO 2 emission reduction rate by 0.009 units at the 5% significance level. The results still hold after a series of robustness tests. Given all else being equal, this significant effect is 0.001. Further analyses show that AANR improves pilot cities&#8217; CO 2 emission reduction rates mainly by enhancing their green innovation capability. The mediating effect of cities&#8217; green technology innovation capability accounts for 96.00%, while the AANR&#8217;s direct effect only accounts for 4.00%. The AANR has significantly positive effects of 0.017% and 0.029% for western cities and cities with high fiscal pressure at the 5% and 1% significance levels, respectively. Therefore, strengthening AANR implementation by enhancing the mediating efficiency of cities&#8217; green technology innovations and implementing dynamically differentiated AANR policies in Chinese meso-cities will contribute to the achievement of China&#8217;s carbon peaking and carbon neutrality targets.</description>

                The efficient reduction of CO2 into valuable products is a challenging task in an international context marked by the climate change crisis and the need to move away from fossil fuels. Recently, the use of water microdroplets has emerged as an interesting reaction media where many redox processes which do not occur in conventional solutions take place spontaneously. Indeed, several experimental studies in microdroplets have already been devoted to study the reduction of CO2 with promising results. The increased reactivity in microdroplets is thought to be linked to unique electrostatic solvation effects at the air&#8208;water interface. In the present work, we report a theoretical investigation on this issue for CO2 using first&#8208;principles molecular dynamics simulations. We show that CO2 is stabilized at the interface, where it can accumulate, and that compared to bulk water solution, its electron capture ability is larger. Our results suggests that reduction of CO2 might be easier in interface&#8208;rich systems such as water microdroplets, which is in line with early experimental data and indicate directions for future laboratory studies. The effect of other relevant factors which could play a role in CO2 reduction potential is discussed.</description>

      <title>Life time of Reinforced Concrete floors of industrial buildings, connected with the use of chlorine</title>

                The article deals with the issues of durability (Life time) of floors of industrial buildings associated with the presence of chlorine. It is shown that, together with carbon dioxide, chlorine forms well-soluble hygroscopic layers in the form of calcium chloride. The movement of chlorine salts causes corrosion of the reinforcement and penetrates deep into the concrete. Therefore, the service life of reinforced concrete elements when exposed to an external aggressive environment is reduced due to corrosion of reinforcement and concrete. Experimental data and analytical dependences of the advance of the front of chloride concentrations dangerous for reinforcement and destruction of concrete under the action of the considered aggressive environment are presented. A formula is derived for the design service life of reinforced concrete structures by the factor of the passivating action of the protective layer of concrete. An empirical dependence of the service life of the structure on the depth of corrosion (diameter reduction) of the reinforcement was also obtained. The coefficient of corrosive wear of reinforcement for rectangular and tee sections bending reinforced concrete elements is calculated.</description>

                The paramount concerns of global warming, fossil fuel depletion, and energy crises have prompted the need of hydrocarbons productions via CO2 conversion. In order to achieve global carbon neutrality, much attention needs to be diverted towards CO2 management. Catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 is an exciting opportunity to curb the increasing CO2 and produce value-added products. However, the comprehensive understanding of CO2 hydrogenation is still a matter of discussion due to its complex reaction mechanism and involvement of various species. This review comprehensively discusses three processes: reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, modified Fischer Tropsch synthesis (MFTS), and methanol-mediated route (MeOH) for CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons. It is also very important to understand the real-time evolvement of catalytic process and reaction intermediates by employing in-situ characterization techniques. Subsequently, in second part of this review, we provided a systematic analysis of advancements in in-situ techniques aimed to monitor the evolution of catalysts during CO2 reduction process. The section also highlights the key components of in-situ cells, their working principles, and applications in identifying reaction mechanisms for CO2 hydrogenation. Finally, by reviewing respective achievements in the field, we identify key gaps and present some future directions for CO2 hydrogenation and in-situ studies.</description>

      <title>LNG VERSUS CONVENTIONAL FUEL POWERED VESSELS: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF ROPAX SHIPS</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5821/mt.13202</link>
      <description>Alvaro Herrero Martinez, Carlos Gonz&#225;lez-Guti&#233;rrez, Andr&#233;s Ortega-Piris, Emma D&#237;az Ruiz de Navamuel, Miguel A. Guitierrez, Alfonso-Isidro L&#243;pez-Diaz, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399515293

                Decarbonization and environmental respect have become pillars of European government policies. As a result of this direction and given that 80% of global freight transportation is carried out by ships, maritime transport emerges as one of the target sectors for these eco measures. Numerous initiatives, projects, and new technologies focused on this field exist. This paper examines the potential reduction of CO2 emissions by using LNG as a fuel either in combination with or instead of conventional fuel on RO-Pax ships. Taking advantage of the fact that we are facing a 'mature' technology already being applied in many ships. Emissions from a fleet of about 30 ships have been studied during the years 2019, 2020, 2021,2022 and 2023 where progressively adding LNG powered vessels from 4 up to 11 during 2023. Based on their annual consumptions&#8217; reports (HFO, MGO and LNG) total tons of polluted CO2 have been quantified together with the ratio tons of CO2 per sailed mile. On the other hand, known daily burned marine fuels of one of those vessels sailing Balearic Islands-Mainland Spain route and due to high increase of gas prices during 2021 and beginning of 2022 (about 350%) a study was conducted: consuming LNG for 265 days whenever possible and avoiding this fuel for 143 days. Therefore, based on the same ship/route, a particular comparison of CO2 emissions per nautical mile is obtained. Finally, using above results, hypothetical study is carried out in which emissions are estimated based on the sailed miles during years 2017 to 2021: Potential emissions in case of LNG versus conventional fuel powered. The 5-year result shows about 17.08% potential reduction. Approximately 32700 tons of CO2 only for 1 vessel highlighting the huge importance of the LNG powered vessels to reduce the environmental impact and the great importance of the investments on Research, Development and Innovation.</description>

      <title>Paris's parking policy for healthier cities</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/s2542-5196(24)00089-5</link>
      <description>Zaheer Allam, Mark Nieuwenhuijsen, Zarrin Allam, &#152;The &#156;Lancet. Planetary health. 8(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399369837

                Paris's policy adjustment in February, 2024, aimed at curbing the influx of large high-emission vehicles into its urban core by escalating parking fees for non-residents, embodies a sophisticated blend of urban planning, environmental quality efforts, climate action, and public health policy. This move is a nuanced approach to discourage the use of vehicles that disproportionately contribute to urban air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The initiative supports sustainable urban mobility, resonating with a wider European endeavour to minimise car dependency within cities.1Nieuwenhuijsen MJ Urban and transport planning pathways to carbon neutral, liveable and healthy cities; a review of the current evidence.Environ Int. 2020; 140105661Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar This policy intervention draws attention to the increasing trend of vehicle upsizing, with sport utility vehicles (SUVs) emerging as a particular concern because of their substantial environmental, climate, and, hence, health footprints. In Paris, transportation accounts for around 30% of greenhouse gas emissions,2Ministry for an Ecological and Solidary TransitionGHG information for transport services: application of article L. 1431-3 of the French transport code.https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/Information_GES%20-%202019.pdfDate: 2019Date accessed: February 1, 2024Google Scholar with private vehicles, particularly diesel and petrol-powered SUVs, being major contributors. As vehicles grow in size, their emissions and fuel consumption escalate correspondingly, exacerbating urban pollution and contributing to climate change. Data indicate that the average size of an SUV has expanded, with some models now mirroring the dimensions of small tanks, exacerbating their unsustainability. For instance, the average carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from new cars registered in 2020 were substantially higher for SUVs, at approximately 134 g/km, which was 13 g higher than the average emissions of other new petrol cars.3European Environment AgencyAverage CO2 emissions from new cars and new vans increased again in 2019.https://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/average-co2-emissions-from-new-cars-vans-2019Date: 2020Date accessed: February 1, 2024Google Scholar This shift towards larger vehicles is driven by a complex interplay of commercial interests and consumer preferences, with automotive manufacturers reaping higher profit margins from sales of SUVs.4Davis SC Truett LF An analysis of the impact of sport utility vehicles in the United States. Oak Ridge National Lab, Oak Ridge, TN2000Google Scholar This trend is alarming because of the clear evidence linking vehicle emissions to clinically significant health risks, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. For instance, SUVs have been associated with greater injury severity than regular sized cars, particularly regarding head injuries, because on collision with a cyclist, the cyclist is more likely to be thrown to the ground and subsequently further injured by other cars.5Monfort SS Mueller BC Bicyclist crashes with cars and SUVs: injury severity and risk factors.Traffic Inj Prev. 2023; 24: 645-651Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar Additionally, outdoor air pollution, to which vehicle emissions are a major contributor, is recognised as a leading environmental risk factor, responsible for millions of premature deaths globally.6Kheirbek I Haney J Douglas S Ito K Matte T The contribution of motor vehicle emissions to ambient fine particulate matter public health impacts in New York City: a health burden assessment.Environ Health. 2016; 15: 89Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar By making it more costly for non-residents to park SUVs and similar high-emission vehicles, the city of Paris is aiming to deter their use and promotes a shift towards smaller cars or use of public transport. This approach is informed by a broader vision of sustainable urban mobility that prioritises active transportation modes, such as walking and cycling, aligning with the 15-minute city concept.7Allam Z Nieuwenhuijsen M Chabaud D Moreno C The 15-minute city offers a new framework for sustainability, liveability, and health.Lancet Planet Health. 2022; 6: e181-e183Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar This model proposes a reconfiguration of urban spaces to ensure that residents can access essential services within a short walk or bicycle ride from their homes, thereby reducing the need for car travel and its associated environmental burden. The implications of such policies extend beyond environmental sustainability to encompass substantial public health benefits. Studies have shown that reducing vehicle emissions can lead to notable improvements in air quality, with consequential reductions in morbidity and mortality from air pollution-related diseases.8Giles-Corti B Foster S Shilton T Falconer R The co-benefits for health of investing in active transportation.N S W Public Health Bull. 2010; 21: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar Furthermore, promoting active transportation contributes to physical health benefits, including reduced obesity rates and improved mental wellbeing, enhancing the overall quality of life for urban residents.8Giles-Corti B Foster S Shilton T Falconer R The co-benefits for health of investing in active transportation.N S W Public Health Bull. 2010; 21: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar Paris's initiative also reflects a growing recognition of the need to address the climate crisis through urban policy measures. The role of cities in the climate agenda is well recognised and, for the first time, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is producing a dedicated special report on climate change and cities as part of an upcoming assessment report.9Intergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeIPCC calls for nomination of experts to draft an outline of the Special Report on Climate Change and Cities.https://www.ipcc.ch/2023/10/27/nomination-experts-climate-change-and-cities-scoping-meeting/Date: 2023Date accessed: February 1, 2024Google Scholar The transportation sector is a major source of CO2 emissions and cities are on the frontline of efforts to transition society towards low-carbon mobility solutions. The move to restrict high-emission vehicles from central urban areas is a crucial step in this direction, signalling a shift towards more sustainable, health-promoting urban environments. Moreover, the policy is indicative of a broader trend in urban governance that seeks to reclaim city spaces for people rather than cars, fostering more liveable, vibrant, and healthy urban landscapes. In addition to environmental and health outcomes, the policy adjustment underscores the importance of liveability as a crucial dimension of urban sustainability. By reducing the dominance of cars in the city centre, Paris is enhancing the accessibility and enjoyment of public spaces, contributing to a more pleasant urban experience for both residents and visitors. This transformation supports the development of communities that are not only ecologically sustainable but also socially inclusive and economically vibrant, aligning with compact city principles.10Nieuwenhuijsen MJ Cities at the heart of the climate action and public health agenda.Lancet Public Health. 2024; 9: e8-e9Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar The Parisian policy could serve as a model for other cities grappling with similar challenges of pollution, congestion, and unsustainable urban growth. It demonstrates the potential of targeted policy interventions to influence consumer behaviour and automotive industry trends, encouraging a shift towards smaller, more efficient, and possibly electric public and active transportation. As such, it contributes to the broader discourse on sustainable urban development, highlighting the interconnectedness of environmental quality, climate crisis, public health, and urban liveability.

                Abstract This systematic review assesses the evidence concerning laser treatments for nail psoriasis (NP), a prevalent condition among individuals with cutaneous psoriasis that notably affects their quality of life. Traditional treatments have limitations in terms of drug delivery and poor patient adherence, leading to interest in laser therapies for their targeted approach, extended treatment intervals, and the potential to enhance topical medication effectiveness. The MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. English&#8208;language randomized and non&#8208;randomized controlled trials with full&#8208;text availability were included. Data on the laser type, treatment protocol, Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) outcomes, and adverse events were extracted, and nail bed and matrix features and patient satisfaction were assessed. The primary effect measure was a percentage reduction in NAPSI scores from baseline. Nineteen studies involving the pulse dye laser (PDL), long&#8208;pulsed neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser and fractional carbon dioxide laser (FCL) were identified. Lasers, particularly those used in conjunction with topical agents, have shown favorable results. PDL effectively lowered NAPSI scores, and the Nd:YAG laser had comparable effectiveness but more discomfort. FCL also shows promise, particularly for topical drug delivery. PDL and Nd:YAG laser treatment were more effective at reducing nail bed features, whereas FCL was effective at reducing both nail bed and matrix features. Overall, lasers are promising treatment alternatives for NP, with similar NAPSI outcomes to topical therapies and intralesional injections.</description>

      <title>Steering Geometric Reconstruction of Bismuth with Accelerated Dynamics for CO2 Electroreduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202407665</link>
      <description>Xiaowen Wang, Yangyang Zhang, Wei Shao, Yifan Li, Feng Yan, Zhifeng Dai, Yanxu Chen, Xianwei Meng, Jianghai Xia, Genqiang Zhang, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399361569

                Bismuth&#8208;based materials have emerged as promising catalysts in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formate. However, the reasons for the reconstruction of Bi&#8208;based precursors to form bismuth nanosheets are still puzzling, especially the formation of defective bismuth sites. Herein, we prepare bismuth nanosheets with vacancy&#8208;rich defects (V&#8208;Bi NS) by rapidly reconstructing Bi19Cl3S27 under negative potential. Theoretical analysis reveals that the introduction of chlorine induces the generation of intrinsic electric field in the precursor, thereby increasing the electron transfer rate and further promoting the metallization of trivalent bismuth. Meanwhile, in situ Raman and ex situ XRD tests verify that Bi19Cl3S27 has a faster reconstruction rate than Bi2S3. The formed V&#8208;Bi NS exhibits up to 96% HCOO&#8208; Faraday efficiency and 400 mA cm&#8208;2 HCOO&#8208; partial current densities, and its ECSA normalized formate current density and yield are 2.2 times higher than those of intact bismuth nanosheets (I&#8208;Bi NS). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that bismuth vacancies with electron&#8208;rich aggregation reduce the activation energy of CO2 to *CO2&#8208; radicals and stabilize the adsorption of the key intermediate *OCHO, thus facilitating the reaction kinetics of formate production.</description>

                Abstract. The CO2-carbonate system dynamics in the North Atlantic Subpolar Gyre (NASPG) were evaluated between 2009 and 2019. Data was collected aboard eight summer cruises through the CLIVAR 59.5&#186; N section. The Ocean Acidification (OA) patterns and the reduction in the saturation state of calcite (&#937;Ca) and aragonite (&#937;Arag) in response to the increasing anthropogenic CO2 (Cant) were assessed within the Irminger, Iceland and Rockall basins during a poorly-assessed decade in which the physical patterns reversed in comparison with previous well-known periods. The observed cooling, freshening and enhanced ventilation increased the interannual rate of accumulation of Cant in the interior ocean by 50&#8211;86 % and the OA rates by close to 10 %. The OA trends were 0.0013&#8211;0.0032 units yr-1 in the Irminger and Iceland basin and 0.0006&#8211;0.0024 units yr-1 in the Rockall Trough, causing a decline in &#937;Ca and &#937;Arag of 0.004&#8211;0.021 and 0.003&#8211;0.0013 units yr-1, respectively. The Cant-driven rise in total inorganic carbon (CT) was the main driver of the OA (contributed by 53&#8211;68 % in upper layers and &gt;82 % toward the interior ocean) and the reduction in &#937;Ca and &#937;Arag (&gt;64 %). The transient decrease in temperature, salinity and AT collectively counteracts the CT-driven acidification by 45&#8211;85 % in the upper layers and in the shallow Rockall Trough and by &lt;10 % in the interior ocean. The present investigation reports the acceleration of the OA within the NASPG and expands knowledge about the future state of the ocean.</description>

                The present study aims to describe the potential sources of energy in Peru with the purpose of implementing them to achieve a sustainable system, taking advantage of the natural resources in the Peruvian land. To achieve this, three alternative scenarios have been defined and analyzed using the LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning) software [Software Version: 2020.1.112]. The scenarios are as follows: the first one, the Business-as-Usual scenario, is based on normal trends according to historical data and referencing projections made by Peruvian state entities; the second one is focused on Energy Efficiency, the highlighted characteristic is taking into consideration the efficient conditions in transmission and distribution of electric energy; and the third one, centered on Geothermal Energy, focused on the development of this type of energy source and prioritizing it. The primary purpose of this analysis is to identify the advantages and disadvantages inherent in each scenario in order to obtain the best out of each one. In this way, the intention is to propose solutions based on Peru&#8217;s national reality or possible uses of the country&#8217;s energy potential to supply its energy demand. Currently, Peru&#8217;s energy demand relies on fossil fuels, hydraulic, and thermal energy. However, there is the possibility of transforming this system into a sustainable one by strengthening existing and growing energy sources such as solar and wind energy and new technologies for hydraulic and thermal energy, in addition to considering geothermal energy as the main energy source in the third scenario. The new system mentioned satisfactorily indicates that the CO2 equivalent emissions decrease significantly in the third scenario, with a 15.8% reduction compared to the first scenario and a 9.7% reduction in comparison to the second. On the other hand, the second scenario shows a 5.6% decrease in CO2 emissions compared to the first, resulting from improvements in technology and energy efficiency without requiring significant modifications or considerable investments, as in the third scenario.</description>

                Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) has become a major source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the waste sector in China. A comprehensive life cycle assessment model was developed for evaluating the regional and seasonal variations of GHG emissions from four MSWI plants with operational data. Subsequently, the scope was expanded nationwide to encompass carbon emission reduction pathways for MSWI plants in China. The results indicated that all plants were sources of GHG emissions, emitting between 187 and 444 kg CO2-eq/t waste, with plastic incineration exerting the most pronounced impact. The direct GHG emissions from MSWI plants exhibit distinct seasonal variations in Jiangsu and Shanghai, with emissions notably higher during the winter season. Considering the physicochemical properties of waste and the energy mix across various provinces in China, a roadmap for GHG emission reduction from MSWI was proposed. Enhanced management of low-value recyclable plastic should be reinforced in regions with higher incineration rates and direct carbon emissions, particularly in the eastern and southern parts of the country. When building or updating MSWI plants, priority should be given to upgrading steam power generation parameters in regions with higher carbon emission factors for electricity generation, such as the northwest, northeast, and southeast. Additionally, a rational design for the peripheral heat supply network of MSWI plants could augment the energy utilization efficiency. The findings are useful for the reduction of carbon emissions from MSWI in China.</description>

      <title>Reduced A&#8211;B super exchange interaction in zirconium doped cobalt ferrite due to laser irradiation</title>

                Abstract The impact of Nd:YAG laser irradiation and the addition of zirconium ions (Zr4+) on the physical properties of CoFe2O4 spinel nano-ferrites has been studied. The co-precipitation method was used to synthesize the samples. Xray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) were employed to examine the structure and morphology. The decrease in the Curie temperature Tc is due to the laser irradiation and the increase in the Zr content of the sample. The difference in the Tc between the non irradiated and the irradiated samples is about 7%, 43% and 34% for CoFe2O4, Co1.1Zr0.1Fe1.8O4, and Co1.3Zr0.3Fe1.4O4, respectively. The decrease in the Tc is due to an increase in the canting of the spins, resulting in a decreased thermal energy required to compensate for the spin alignment. The decrease in the coercivity of the laser irradiated sample is due to a reduction in the magnetic anisotropy and an altered distribution of the cations (Co2+, Fe3+, Zr4+). The observed trend indicates that laser irradiation, and Zr substitution, can be used to modify the magnetic hardness of the samples. The low coercivity of irradiated Co1.1Zr0.1Fe1.8O4 makes it suitable for a range of applications. The high-frequency response of the Co1+xZrxFe2-2xO4 NPs shows that they can operate within the frequency range of 7.5 GHz&#8211;11.56 GHz.&amp;#xD;</description>

      <title>Apolipoproteins and Its Association with Dengue Virus Serotype 2 (DENV-2) Infectivity in Human Hepatoma Cell Line (Huh7)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48048/tis.2024.7674</link>

                Introduction: Previous studies have shown that lipid components are involved in the internalization of Dengue virus (DENV), however, this mechanism has been hypothesized mostly through clinical studies correlating between dengue severity and lipid levels. This study aimed to determine DENV-2 internalization in the presence of apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1), B (apoB) or E (apoE) in human hepatoma cell line (Huh7). Materials and methods: Tetrazolium reduction assays were used to assess the cytotoxicity of apolipoproteins on Huh7. DENV-2 at MOI of 1 with 2 &#181;g/mL apoA1, apoB and apoE, respectively were introduced into the confluent Huh7 cells and incubated for an hour (internalization) and 72 h (replication) at 37 &#176;C, 5 % CO2. The replication experiments were repeated after SR-B1 siRNA treatment. Samples collected were subjected to qPCR for viral load determination. Differences between groups were assessed by ANOVA and independent T-Test. Results and discussion: Treatment with apoA1 and apoB demonstrated significant increment in DENV-2 internalization and replication compared to apoE (internalization: p = 0.022 and p = 0.323 vs p = 0.878, respectively; replication: p = 0.004 and p = 0.016 vs p = 0.897, respectively). A significant reduction of DENV2 infectivity was seen in apoA1 treated cells with SR-B1 down-regulation/silencing (35.2 % reduction, p = 0.013). Conclusions: apoA1 and apoB, enhanced initial attachment of DENV-2 to cell surface, suggesting their role in DENV internalization and infectivity. HIGHLIGHTS This research determined the effects of apolipoproteins on dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2) internalization in vitro using the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7) apoA1 and apoB enhance the initial attachment of DENV-2 to the cell surface Knockdown of SR-B1 receptors reduces apoA1-treated DENV-2 internalization, suggesting the role of SR-B1 as a route of entry for DENV-2 Knockdown of SR-B1 receptors had no effect on apoB-treated DENV-2 internalization, suggesting it uses another entry pathway GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT</description>

      <title>Microplastics increase the microbial functional potential of greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution in a freshwater lake: a metagenomic study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.119250</link>
      <description>Tianyu Zhuo, Kehong Yu, Bo Chai, Qingfeng Tang, Xia Gao, Jiamin Wang, Lei He, Xiaohui Lei, Yang Li, Meng Yuan, Lifeng Wu, Bin Chen, Environmental research. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399356879

                Aquatic ecosystems are being increasingly polluted by microplastics (MPs), which calls for an understanding of how MPs affect microbially driven biogenic element cycling in water environments. A 28-day incubation experiment was conducted using freshwater lake water added with three polymer types of MPs (i.e., polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene) separately or in combination at a concentration of 1 items/L. The effects of various MPs on microbial communities and functional genes related to carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur cycling were analyzed using metagenomics. Results showed that Sphingomonas and Novosphingobium, which were indicator taxa (genus level) in the polyethylene treatment group, made the largest functional contribution to biogenic element cycling. Following the addition of MPs, the relative abundances of genes related to methane oxidation (e.g., hdrD, frhB, accAB) and denitrification (napABC, nirK, norB) increased. These changes were accompanied by increased relative abundances of genes involved in organic phosphorus mineralization (e.g., phoAD) and sulfate reduction (cysHIJ), as well as decreased relative abundances of genes involved in phosphate transport (phnCDE) and the SOX system. Findings of this study underscore that MPs, especially polyethylene, increase the potential of greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, N2O) and water pollution (PO43&#8211;, H2S) in freshwater lakes at the functional gene level.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically reactive hyperbranched interface governs graphene oxide dispersion and crosslinking in epoxy for enhanced flame retardancy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.06.005</link>
      <description>Hefeng Li, Cong Liu, Jie Zhu, Xianhua Huan, Kun Xu, Hongbo Geng, Xiaopeng Chen, Tianming Li, Da Deng, Ding Wen-hui, Lei Zu, Ge Liu, Xiaolong Jia, Xiaoping Yang, Journal of colloid and interface science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399393303

                Enhancing the flame retardancy of epoxy (EP) resins typically entailed a trade-off with other physical properties. Herein, hyperbranched poly(amidoamine) (HPAA) and phytic acid (PA) were used to functionalize graphene oxide (GO) via electrostatic self-assembly in water to prepare a phosphorus-nitrogen functionalized graphene oxide nanosheet (PN-GOs), which could be utilized as high efficient flame-retardant additive of epoxy resin without sacrificing other properties. The PN-GOs demonstrated improved dispersion and compatibility within the EP matrix, which resulted in significant concurrent enhancements in both the mechanical performance and flame-retardant properties of the PN-GOs/EP nanocomposites over virgin EP. Notably, the incorporation of just 1.0 wt% PN-GOs yielded a 20.4, 6.4 and 42.7 % increases in flexural strength, flexural modulus and impact strength for the PN-GOs/EP nanocomposites, respectively. Furthermore, simultaneous reductions were achieved in the peak heat release rate (pHRR) by 60.0 %, total smoke production (TSP) by 43.0 %, peak CO production rate (pCOP) by 57.9 %, and peak CO2 production rate (pCO2P) by 63.9 %. This study presented a facile method for the design of GO-based nano flame retardants, expanding their application potential in polymer-matrix composites.</description>

      <title>Telemonitoring with wearables and artificial intelligence for sustainable healthcare</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1097/dm-2024-00004</link>
      <description>C&#233;sar Morcillo Serra, Araceli Jim&#233;nez Fuertes, Efra&#237;n L&#243;pez Caicedo, Luciano Leandro Garc&#237;a Fern&#225;ndez, Jos&#233; Francisco Tom&#225;s Mart&#237;nez, Digital medicine. 10(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399368374

                There is overwhelming evidence that virtual consultations can reduce health care carbon emissions, largely by reducing travel related to in-person appointments.[1] Due to the incredibly important nature of this topic,[2] it is crucial not only to advance scientific discourse but also to highlight other ways in which telemedicine can be made more sustainable, such as the use of wearables[3] and, above all, smartwatches and artificial intelligence (AI) solutions on mobile phones, especially when they are integrated into a telemonitoring platform, with a clinical advisory service that manages alerts via digital consultation. Drawing from our experience with a patient telemonitoring program for different health conditions,[4] which involved 16,200 patients over three years (2020&#8211;2023), 864,209 wearable measurements were obtained. The majority (97%) were from smartwatches (34% from Apple, 23% from Garmin, 20% from Google Fit, 8% from Fitbit, 4% from Samsung, 3% from Strava, 3% from Polar, and 2% from Withings). However, 3% of patients, depending on the profile, also used connected health devices such as electrocardiograms, spirometers, pulse oximeters, scales, and blood pressure devices. The remote monitoring platform allows the measurement and visualization of the evolution of vital signs captured by devices connected to a health application (Figure 1). The intelligent system analyses these measurements and allows the detection of anomalies. The clinical team manages alerts, periodically reviews the information received and proactively contacts patients via digital consultation, prioritizing based on the information received. The mobile application also allows patients to contact the clinical team via digital consultation 24/7 (Figure 2).Figure 1.: Screenshots of the telemonitoring mobile application that integrates facial transdermal optical imaging with AI and wearables connected with a clinical advisory service that manages alerts via digital consultation.Figure 2.: Features of the telemonitoring platform. Patients' utilization of regular smartwatches, which already incorporate health measurement capabilities, eliminates the need to purchase specific devices for disease control. In doing so, smartwatches not only reduce costs for patients but also minimize electronic waste and resource consumption associated with dedicated medical devices. Furthermore, simple measurements of physiological and activity parameters captured by wearables often serve as indicators of disease decompensation, enabling timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.[5,6] By using AI and facial transdermal optical imaging on mobile devices, 382,943 measurements were also obtained. These measurements are integrated into our mobile health application, which uses NuraLogix's cloud-based software to determine measurements based on facial blood flow information. The application allows the measurement of heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure, among other variables.[7] This technology allows blood pressure to be measured with an average overall accuracy of 95% in the following ranges: systolic: 100&#8211;139 mmHg; diastolic: 60&#8211;89 mmHg. Blood pressure prediction models predict blood pressure with a measurement bias &#177; standard deviation of 0.39 &#177; 7.30 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and -0.20 &#177; 6.00 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. For heart rate, the application has a good correlation with electrocardiogram measurements, with an average overall accuracy of 95% and with a result within 3 beats of the true value in the heart rate range between 30 bpm and 200 bpm. In compliance with United States Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and European Union General Data Protection Regulation regulations and to protect privacy, certain personal data collected, such as facial images and video recordings, are not stored. This technology eliminates the need for additional specific devices, reducing the production and utilization of specialized medical equipment. To maintain consistency in the data collected between different devices, all data are stored in the same database, and the origin is classified based on the type of measurement device. This information is available to both the patient and health care personnel at all times, who can differentiate the origin of the measurements (Figure 3).Figure 3.: The back office of the medical team, showing the telemonitoring program with the data from the patient's different devices; the medical team is able to differentiate the source of each data point (whether it comes from a wearable or AI facial analysis). Our telemonitoring program has successfully facilitated 39,098 digital consultations for medical advice and for managing alerts generated by wearable and mobile devices. Communication channels for consultations were predominantly chat (67%), video consultations (24%), and phone calls (9%). We think that it is essential that wearable health data be remotely monitored by a medical team to avoid trips to the hospital to resolve concerns over possible deviations. We calculated the net carbon savings of performing a visit online by summing the carbon savings derived from the avoided patient travel for a face-to-face appointment and subtracting the videoconferencing and phone call emissions. To calculate the net CO2 emission data avoided owing to patients' switch to digital processes, we worked with the Carbon Trust, a global climate change and sustainability consultancy. We reviewed statistical data on the average distances travelled by Sanitas customers to go from their homes to a doctor's surgery; with these data, we calculated the average distance covered nationally (approximately 13 km for a round trip). The methodology included a review of the different modes of travel used by the population, according to national statistics registers of Spain and the UK.[8] Different means of transport were analysed (walking, cycling, bus, train, car) with the following considerations. In large provinces (Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia), 50% of the clients travelled by car, 21% by bus, 26% by train or metro and 3% by a non-polluting method of transport (walking, cycling). In the remaining provinces, 80% of the respondents travelled by car, 9% by bus, 8.0% by train and 3% by a non-polluting method of transport. In its methodology, the Carbon Trust included in its equation the CO2 emissions generated by using digital tools for video appointments (energy consumption of equipment and data transmission) or to download and save a digital medical report. Emissions related to videoconferencing were subtracted from the total avoided emissions to establish a "net" quota of avoided CO2. To calculate the emissions generated during a video consultation, the energy consumption of a videoconference was estimated to last an average of 9.5 minutes and was calculated based on the energy intensity of data centres, data transmission and the use of devices, in line with the reports of the International Energy Agenda. The emission factor of the Spanish electricity mix was used. The calculation above yielded an average of 3.057 kg of net CO2 emissions avoided per digital appointment.[9] Assuming that chat consultations have a similar impact and by multiplying the calculated average savings of 3057 kg of CO2 per appointment by the 39,098 digital consultations that were made through the telemonitoring program, we achieved a net reduction of 119.5 tons of CO2 emissions over the three-year period. Nowhere are the effects of climate change manifesting more clearly than on human health. The modern health care sector contributes to this serious phenomenon and is simultaneously affected by it. Although transportation for health reasons represents only 1.5% of the total number of trips,[9] ameliorating the environmental impacts of the health care sector and reducing greenhouse gas emissions can not only improve health for everyone but also reduce the costs of care.[10] In conclusion, our experience with the integration of wearables and facial transdermal optical imaging with AI on mobile devices into a medical telemonitoring platform holds immense potential for improving patient care while minimizing environmental impact by reducing CO2 emissions through digital management.</description>

      <title>Interventions for postburn pruritus</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013468.pub2</link>
      <description>Sarthak Sinha, Vincent Gabriel, Rohit Arora, Wisoo Shin, J Scott, Shyla K Bharadia, Myriam Verly, Waleed Rahmani, Duncan Nickerson, Frankie O. G. Fraulin, Pallab Chatterjee, Rajeev Ahuja, Jeff Biernaskie, Cochrane library. 2024(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399365486

                Background Postburn pruritus (itch) is a common and distressing symptom experienced on healing or healed burn or donor site wounds. Topical, systemic, and physical treatments are available to control postburn pruritus; however, it remains unclear how effective these are. Objectives To assess the effects of interventions for treating postburn pruritus in any care setting. Search methods In September 2022, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE (including In&#8208;Process &amp; Other Non&#8208;Indexed Citations), Ovid Embase, and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries and scanned references of relevant publications to identify eligible trials. There were no restrictions with respect to language, publication date, or study setting. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled people with postburn pruritus to compare an intervention for postburn pruritus with any other intervention, placebo or sham intervention, or no intervention. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results We included 25 RCTs assessing 21 interventions with 1166 randomised participants. These 21 interventions can be grouped into six categories: neuromodulatory agents (such as doxepin, gabapentin, pregabalin, ondansetron), topical therapies (such as CQ&#8208;01 hydrogel, silicone gel, enalapril ointment, Provase moisturiser, beeswax and herbal oil cream), physical modalities (such as massage therapy, therapeutic touch, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, enhanced education about silicone gel sheeting), laser scar revision (pulsed dye laser, pulsed high&#8208;intensity laser, fractional CO2 laser), electrical stimulation (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation), and other therapies (cetirizine/cimetidine combination, lemon balm tea). Most RCTs were conducted at academic hospitals and were at a high risk of performance, attrition, and detection bias. While 24 out of 25 included studies reported change in burn&#8208;related pruritus, secondary outcomes such as cost&#8208;effectiveness, pain, patient perception, wound healing, and participant health&#8208;related quality of life were not reported or were reported incompletely. Neuromodulatory agents versus antihistamines or placebo There is low&#8208;certainty evidence that doxepin cream may reduce burn&#8208;related pruritus compared with oral antihistamine (mean difference (MD) &#8208;2.60 on a 0 to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS), 95% confidence interval (CI) &#8208;3.79 to &#8208;1.42; 2 studies, 49 participants). A change of 2 points represents a minimal clinically important difference (MCID). Due to very low&#8208;certainty evidence, it is uncertain whether doxepin cream impacts the incidence of somnolence as an adverse event compared to oral antihistamine (risk ratio (RR) 0.64, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.25; 1 study, 24 participants). No data were reported on pain in the included study. There is low&#8208;certainty evidence that gabapentin may reduce burn&#8208;related pruritus compared with cetirizine (MD &#8208;2.40 VAS, 95% CI &#8208;4.14 to &#8208;0.66; 1 study, 40 participants). A change of 2 points represents a MCID. There is low&#8208;certainty evidence that gabapentin reduces the incidence of somnolence compared to cetirizine (RR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.38; 1 study, 40 participants). No data were reported on pain in the included study. There is low&#8208;certainty evidence that pregabalin may result in a reduction in burn&#8208;related pruritus intensity compared with cetirizine with pheniramine maleate (MD &#8208;0.80 VAS, 95% CI &#8208;1.24 to &#8208;0.36; 1 study, 40 participants). A change of 2 points represents a MCID. There is low&#8208;certainty evidence that pregabalin reduces the incidence of somnolence compared to cetirizine (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.69; 1 study, 40 participants). No data were reported on pain in the included study. There is moderate&#8208;certainty evidence that ondansetron probably results in a reduction in burn&#8208;related pruritus intensity compared with diphenhydramine (MD &#8208;0.76 on a 0 to 10 numeric analogue scale (NAS), 95% CI &#8208;1.50 to &#8208;0.02; 1 study, 38 participants). A change of 2 points represents a MCID. No data were reported on pain and adverse events in the included study. Topical therapies versus relevant comparators There is moderate&#8208;certainty evidence that enalapril ointment probably decreases mean burn&#8208;related pruritus compared with placebo control (MD &#8208;0.70 on a 0 to 4 scoring table for itching, 95% CI &#8208;1.04 to &#8208;0.36; 1 study, 60 participants). No data were reported on pain and adverse events in the included study. Physical modalities versus relevant comparators Compared with standard care, there is low&#8208;certainty evidence that massage may reduce burn&#8208;related pruritus (standardised mean difference (SMD) &#8208;0.86, 95% CI &#8208;1.45 to &#8208;0.27; 2 studies, 166 participants) and pain (SMD &#8208;1.32, 95% CI &#8208;1.66 to &#8208;0.98). These SMDs equate to a 4.60&#8208;point reduction in pruritus and a 3.74&#8208;point reduction in pain on a 10&#8208;point VAS. A change of 2 VAS points in itch represents a MCID. No data were reported on adverse events in the included studies. There is low&#8208;certainty evidence that extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) may reduce burn&#8208;related pruritus compared with sham stimulation (SMD &#8208;1.20, 95% CI &#8208;1.65 to &#8208;0.75; 2 studies, 91 participants). This equates to a 5.93&#8208;point reduction in pruritus on a 22&#8208;point 12&#8208;item Pruritus Severity Scale. There is low&#8208;certainty evidence that ESWT may reduce pain compared with sham stimulation (MD 2.96 on a 0 to 25 pressure pain threshold (PPT), 95% CI 1.76 to 4.16; 1 study, 45 participants). No data were reported on adverse events in the included studies. Laser scar revision versus untreated or placebo controls There is moderate&#8208;certainty evidence that pulsed high&#8208;intensity laser probably results in a reduction in burn&#8208;related pruritus intensity compared with placebo laser (MD &#8208;0.51 on a 0 to 1 Itch Severity Scale (ISS), 95% CI &#8208;0.64 to &#8208;0.38; 1 study, 49 participants). There is moderate&#8208;certainty evidence that pulsed high&#8208;intensity laser probably reduces pain compared with placebo laser (MD &#8208;3.23 VAS, 95% CI &#8208;5.41 to &#8208;1.05; 1 study, 49 participants). No data were reported on adverse events in the included studies. Authors' conclusions There is moderate to low&#8208;certainty evidence on the effects of 21 interventions. Most studies were small and at a high risk of bias related to blinding and incomplete outcome data. Where there is moderate&#8208;certainty evidence, practitioners should consider the applicability of the evidence for their patients.</description>

                In Scandinavia, we have a proud tradition of exercise physiology. The period from 1910 to 1920, during which August Krogh (1874&#8211;1949) and Johannes Lindhard (1870&#8211;1947) provided measurements on cardiorespiratory function and metabolism during exercise in humans, can certainly be considered its birth, at least from a merely Danish perspective. However, it is in my opinion the decades that followed the establishment of the Rockefeller Institute in Copenhagen in 1928 that comprise the formative years of Scandinavian exercise physiology. This institute, established with funds secured by August Krogh after he became a Nobel laureate, offered advanced research and teaching facilities in areas such as zoophysiology, medical physiology, gymnastics theory, biochemistry and biophysics (Asmussen, 1987). Krogh was instrumental in its design, ensuring the inclusion of facilities for Lindhard's Gymnastics Theory Laboratory on the first floor of the north wing, strategically located above his own Zoophysiological Laboratory to facilitate interaction and collaboration. It was in this environment, and under the guidance of both Lindhard and Krogh, that three scientists emerged as seminal figures in Scandinavian exercise physiology: Erik Hohw&#252; Christensen (1904&#8211;1996), Marius Nielsen (1903&#8211;2000) and Erling Asmussen (1907&#8211;1991), fondly referred to by Krogh as 'The Three Musketeers' (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1995). The tales of these three scientists are many, and their efforts to evolve and promote exercise physiology, scientifically, pedagogically and organisationally, are certainly reminiscent of the noble characters' fight for justice in Alexandre Dumas's novel. I will try to refrain from digressing too much into the swashbuckler genre here, but Dumas's sentiment that 'the merit of all things lies in their difficulty' seems to resonate well with their scientific endeavours, as they repeatedly tackled scientific challenges that appeared insurmountable, either conceptually or methodologically (Asmussen, 1987; &#197;strand, 1991). However, because a comprehensive account of their collective contributions would merit a whole monograph in its own right, I will only recapitulate one important aspect of their work from the formative years of Scandinavian exercise physiology here: the adaptative resetting of homeostasis across organ systems during exercise. Erik Hohw&#252; Christensen, universally known as 'Hohw&#252;', was still an undergraduate student in natural history, chemistry, geography and geology when he joined Lindhard at the Gymnastics Theory Laboratory, shortly after the Rockefeller Institute had been inaugurated in 1928. Under Lindhard's supervision, he engaged in a series of studies that followed up on Krogh and Lindhard's work from the preceding decade that demonstrated extremely rapid cardiovascular and gas exchange kinetics following exercise onset. Initially, his efforts were focused on enhancing the functionality of Krogh's bicycle ergometer (Krogh, 1913) and refining Krogh and Lindhard's nitrous oxide rebreathing technique developed for the measurement of cardiac output (Krogh &amp; Lindhard, 1912). While doing this, Hohw&#252; ensured an unprecedented standardisation of experimental conditions, exercising stringent control over variables such as diet, meal timings and rest periods prior to measurements. As an alternative to the nitrous oxide rebreathing technique, Hohw&#252; adapted the relatively new acetylene rebreathing method for measurements during exercise (Christensen, 1931a, 1932a), and soon Hohw&#252; expanded from mere methodologically based studies to mechanistic studies that focused not only on cardiac output, but also on blood glucose, respiration and thermoregulation (Christensen, 1931b, 1931c, 1931d, 1931e, 1932b). However, while Krogh and Lindhard's studies had mostly focused on exercise at moderate intensity in moderately fit men approaching middle age (themselves), Hohw&#252; continued the longstanding Scandinavian tradition of self-experimentation within physiology, to conduct studies at (near-)maximal intensity in highly fit, young athletes, that is, himself and three fellow students that he knew from his dormitory, including Marius Nielsen. All these experiments were meticulously carried out using Krogh's now-optimised bicycle ergometer, ensuring well-defined workloads. Most critically, and unlike other contemporary studies that typically captured measurements during transitional states&#8212;such as at the onset of exercise, immediately following exertion or during short breaks&#8212;Hohw&#252;'s work was characterised by extended continuous exercise sessions that facilitated the acquisition of steady state measurements, to compare and distinguish the physiological changes that take place during rest, exercise at well-defined intensities, and recovery. Hohw&#252; graduated in 1931, majoring in gymnastic theory, and defended his doctoral thesis based on the abovementioned studies later the same year. Marius Nielsen also graduated in 1931, majoring in natural history, and soon began conducting his experiments at the Gymnastics Theory Laboratory, focusing on the work of breathing during exercise (Nielsen, 1936a). Soon, an opportunity arose that would prove pivotal to their continued work. Since World War I, there had been an extraordinary surge in enthusiasm for sports, fuelled by the belief in athleticism as a crucial factor for health. However, some critics questioned whether these efforts genuinely contributed to improving health, highlighting the lack of clear evidence on whether athletic sports had a positive or negative impact on the body. The ambiguity surrounding the physiological effects of strenuous exercise and the safe limits of such exertion prompted the League of Nations' Health Organization to convene a meeting in Copenhagen in January 1931. Here, it was acknowledged that the specific changes occurring in the body under extreme athletic strain remained largely unexplored. To address this, experts at the meeting recommended that the Health Organization initiate a comprehensive study into various physiological responses to maximum muscular effort. Krogh and Lindhard, who attended the meeting, proposed a 2-year research programme to investigate these phenomena and subsequently received funding to continue Hohw&#252; and Nielsen's research. The preliminary results were presented to the Health Organization in Geneva in 1934, encompassing a comprehensive 32-page report (Christensen et al., 1934), which is also an early account of the oxygen transport cascade, highlighting the convective and diffusive steps for oxygen transport from ambient air to working muscle in relation to exercise performance. The funding from the League of Nations' Health Organization enabled Krogh to hire both Hohw&#252; and Nielsen as research assistants at the Zoophysiological Laboratory. Nielsen utilised this opportunity to also focus on the chemical regulation of ventilation (Nielsen, 1936b). These studies were not particularly focused on exercise as such, but exercise was used along with hypobaric hypoxia and experimentally induced metabolic acidosis (by orally administered ammonium chloride) as a means for uncovering the mechanisms regulating ventilation in humans. Specifically, Nielsen aimed to determine whether CO2 or H+ was the primary chemical stimulus that increased the 'excitability' of the respiratory centre to enhance breathing in these different conditions, a matter of great controversy during those years. During exercise, it was believed that either the increased CO2 or H+ production in the contracting skeletal muscle (and other working tissues) could increase P aC O 2 ${{P}_{{\mathrm{aC}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ and/or reduce arterial pH, which would then increase ventilation. Lindhard and Krogh, in particular, had both placed their bets on P aC O 2 ${{P}_{{\mathrm{aC}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ , but much to Nielsen's surprise, he found that both P aC O 2 ${{P}_{{\mathrm{aC}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ and arterial pH remained relatively constant during the prolonged strenuous exercise sessions to which he subjected Hohw&#252; and his fellow students. When Nielsen presented this to Krogh, admitting that he did not understand how to grasp these findings, Krogh replied, 'No, I don't understand that either! You must find out!' Krogh said this in such a compelling manner that it remained a source of inspiration for Nielsen for much of his future work (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1995). Nielsen defended his doctoral thesis on the regulation of respiration in 1936. While he did not succeed in conclusively determining whether CO&#8322; or H&#8314; was the primary stimulus governing the regulation of ventilation, much pointed towards CO2. However, the stimulus for the increased ventilation during any of the examined conditions was clearly not an increase in P aC O 2 ${{P}_{{\mathrm{aC}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_2}}}$ per se, but rather seemed to involve an altered sensitivity of the respiratory centre to CO&#8322; (Nielsen, 1936b). Curiously, Nielsen followed up with a study on thermoregulation during exercise, to challenge a common viewpoint that the increase in core temperature during exercise represents a failure of thermoregulation (Nielsen, 1938). Hohw&#252;'s previous study on core temperature during prolonged strenuous exercise, showing increases in temperature to levels that would be considered life-threatening in a clinical setting, had not done much to resolve this (Christensen, 1931c). In a room that was carefully thermoregulated to maintain consistent air temperature and humidity, the young scientists cycled vigorously at various intensities on Krogh's bicycle ergometer, which was suspended on a scale for the continuous measurement of weight loss due to perspiration, while rectal and skin temperatures were continuously measured (Nielsen, 1936a, 1936b). Rectal temperature increased proportionally with exercise intensity, independently of differences in the conditions for heat loss, while changes in skin temperature remained relatively minor (Nielsen, 1938). In fact, body temperature was kept within much narrower limits at a given exercise intensity than at rest. Nielsen could thus conclude that the rise in body temperature during exercise is a regulatory response and not the result of a failure in thermoregulation (Nielsen, 1938). Together, Nielsen's studies on ventilation and thermoregulation, conducted under carefully controlled conditions and at a well-defined steady state of exercise as established by Hohw&#252;, pointed towards highly regulated exercise adaptations. While all this was going on, Asmussen, who was slightly younger than Hohw&#252; and Nielsen, had started attending lectures at the Rockefeller Institute as a student of natural history. He became acquainted with Hohw&#252; who knew that Lindhard needed an assistant to develop a method for isolating frog skeletal muscle fibres. Asmussen thus joined the Gymnastics Theory Laboratory as an unpaid assistant, and soon he was able to isolate muscle fibres from the frog's semitendinosus muscle, which then allowed him to conduct a series of studies on isometric and isotonic contractions. He continued spending his afternoons and evenings doing this after he majored in gymnastic theory in 1931 while earning his livelihood as a secondary school teacher of natural history and physical education, and in 1933 he defended his doctoral thesis on this work. By 1935, Asmussen had finally landed a position as a full-time research assistant at the Gymnastics Theory Laboratory, this time with an actual salary, so that he could quit his job as a secondary school teacher and focus more wholly on his research. However, in the meantime, Lindhard had invited the renowned German neurophysiologist Fritz Buchtal (1907&#8211;2003) to join the laboratory, in part because of the increasing hostility towards the Jewish community in Germany. Buchtal's expertise naturally drove the focus at the laboratory more in the direction of electrophysiological studies of skeletal muscle, which prompted Asmussen to concentrate on the integrative physiology of the human body in response to exercise instead. Asmussen thus conducted a study on the cardiopulmonary response to static exercise by leg presses against an angle lever with considerable loads. The study showed that oxygen uptake, ventilation and cardiac output showed variable changes during exercise depending on the workload, but they all increased sharply immediately after, which was attributed to the mechanical constraint of blood flow by the actively engaged muscles (Asmussen &amp; Hansen, 1938). The thematic overlap between Hohw&#252; and Nielsen were obvious to anyone, and soon the three started working closely together. Thus, by 1936, the memorable trio had finally been formed! Initially, Hohw&#252;, Nielsen and Asmussen turned their attention towards matters deemed urgent at the time, in particular the mechanisms behind the increase in cardiac output during exercise. A prevalent theory suggested that vasodilatation in working muscle triggered a reduction in arterial blood pressure, which then led to an increase in cardiac output through baroreflex feedback. However, this could not explain the increase in stroke volume previously reported by Hohw&#252; (Christensen, 1931e), and furthermore, the arterial baroreflex feedback loop had not been conclusively demonstrated in humans, neither during postural changes nor during steady state exercise. Moreover, the existing studies often uncritically assumed that heart rate was an accurate reflection of cardiac output, a notion also inconsistent with Hohw&#252;'s earlier studies (Christensen, 1931d, 1931e). In the basement under the north wing of the Rockefeller Institute, the trio devised an experimental set-up allowing for the manipulation of blood volume distribution through pneumatic thigh cuff inflation and deflation and by the use of a tilt table (enabling upright, supine and head-down measurements), reconstructed from a resuscitation table previously designed by Krogh in one of his less successful scientific endeavours (Krogh, 1934). This set-up also permitted the measurement of oxygen uptake, cardiac output (by Hohw&#252;'s modified acetylene rebreathing technique), and blood volume changes through water displacement plethysmography. They mostly used exercise protocols that involved rhythmic arm extensions against an elastic resistance, or by employing Krogh's bicycle ergometer. The routine was such that, after completing their teaching duties around 10 a.m., The Three Musketeers would commence the day's experiments, during which they took turns serving as experimental subjects. Following lunch, they dedicated time to analysing the data obtained. The set-up and measurements were continually refined to achieve reproducible results; even so, one experimental day would generally yield only one measurement point for a given variable (Asmussen, 1987). Therefore, although their papers often report results from relatively few, in this case three subjects, these results are usually based on several months of daily experimentation. When it came to drafting manuscripts based on the the data, they would sit together at a desk in the late afternoons and evenings; Nielsen, having the neatest handwriting, would write with a pencil as they collectively formulated each sentence of the paper, while Hohw&#252;, who came from a Danish-minded family in Southern Jutland&#8212;a region that had not become part of Denmark until the Reunification in 1920&#8212;and had attended a German school, ensured that the paper's language, written in German, was impeccable (Asmussen, 1987). Krogh was a regular visitor, keen to showcase the experimental set-up to scientists from around the world, and in the evenings, he would often stop by to discuss results and ideas, contributing to further optimisation of the experiments (Asmussen, 1987; Schmidt-Nielsen, 1995). In their collaborative experiments conducted from 1936 and approximately 5 years forth, The Three Musketeers demonstrated that thigh cuff deflation in the sitting position and a postural change from supine to upright both result in blood displacement to the lower extremities with a concomitant increase in heart rate, and vice versa when moving from upright to the supine posture (Asmussen et al., 1938, 1939a). Despite a higher heart rate in the upright position, cardiac output was found to be lower due to a lower stroke volume than in the supine position, even though oxygen uptake was similar (Asmussen et al., 1939b). Additionally, superimposing arm exercise during postural changes while restricting venous return by thigh cuff inflation, caused heart rate to vary with posture in relation to differences in stroke volume, but it still increased with exercise in all postures (Asmussen &amp; Christensen, 1939; Asmussen et al., 1939c). The baroreflex feedback loop could thus be effectively demonstrated in humans, and it seemed to remain equally effective for regulating heart rate during exercise compared to rest. Hence, as Nielsen had demonstrated for ventilation and thermoregulation, the changes in cardiovascular function during exercise seemed to reflect highly regulated phenomena. In another study, about half of the working musculature was isolated from the rest of the circulation by thigh cuff inflation during exercise on Krogh's bicycle ergometer. Despite a significant reduction in oxygen uptake, cardiac output and heart rate were barely affected (Asmussen et al., 1940). This indicated that the determinant of the cardiac output increase during exercise was the workload. In a subsequent study, a similar increase in cardiac output was observed, both in the healthy state and in the case of impaired proprioceptive feedback due to posterior fascicle demyelination (neurosyphilis) when muscle contractions were induced by electrical stimulation (Asmussen et al., 1943a). Together these studies showed that during steady state light-to-moderate exercise, it was not vasodilatation in the working muscle nor cortical feed-forward impulses that accounted for the increase in cardiac output. Given that no substances produced in the muscles below the inflated cuffs could enter the main circulation while the nervous connections remained intact, a neural feedback mechanism related to the volume of involved musculature, but unrelated to proprioception, seemed to be at play. Following up on the studies from Nielsen's doctoral thesis, similar observations were made regarding the ventilatory response to exercise. Thus, during light and moderate exercise on Krogh's bicycle ergometer, the reduction in oxygen uptake evoked by thigh cuff inflation did not affect the ventilatory response to exercise (Asmussen, Hohw&#252; Christensen et al., 1943). Furthermore, a similar ventilatory response was observed during electrically induced muscle contractions, both in the healthy state and in the case of posterior fascicle demyelination (Asmussen et al., 1943b). Hence, the steady state ventilatory response to exercise also seemed to be triggered by a non-proprioceptive neural feedback mechanism. By the early 1940s, The Three Musketeers had thus demonstrated that ventilation, thermoregulation and cardiovascular function remain tightly regulated during exercise, involving feedback mechanisms originating within the working skeletal muscle that function to reset this regulation according to the given workload. However, they could not identify the exact stimulus that triggered this feedback mechanism. In 1941, that is, at the peak of The Three Musketeers' collaborative studies, Hohw&#252; decided to depart to Sweden to pursue a professorship at the Royal Gymnastic Central Institute (GCI) in Stockholm, thus marking the end of this formative period of Scandinavian exercise physiology. Apart from a brief leave of absence from GCI in the early 1960s, Hohw&#252; remained there until his retirement in 1970. However, to quote Dumas, 'Friendship is a sacred bond that cannot be broken by distance or time', and the trio remained in touch. Notably, Asmussen and Nielsen, who both became professors at the Gymnastics Theory Laboratory in 1961 and 1965, respectively, continued to investigate the elusive stimulus within working muscle that seemingly functioned to reset homeostatic regulation, initially naming it the 'work stimulus' (Asmussen &amp; Nielsen, 1958), but later using the term 'work factor' (Asmussen, 1965), thus aligning with the contemporary terminology in exercise endocrinology (Goldstein, 1965; Ingle, 1955). Later, Hohw&#252;'s students, notably Bengt Saltin (1935&#8211;2014), followed up on another series of Hohw&#252;'s early studies on skeletal muscle fuel utilization during exercise, thereby integrating glucose homeostasis into this paradigm. However, that is a different story for another time. When reflecting on the collaboration between The Three Musketeers within the context of Alexandre Dumas's 1842 novel, I have often wondered: who is who? One might liken Hohw&#252; to Athos, the noble and naturally leading figure. Nielsen could be compared to Aramis, the quieter and more thoughtful innovator. As for Asmussen, rather than resembling Porthos, the jovial and boisterous member, he might be better represented as D'Artagnan. Hence, during these formative years, the younger Asmussen grew to become Hohw&#252; and Nielsen's equal, and subsequently a driving force for their collaboration that served as the group's visionary (Saltin, 1991). This is well-exemplified by an opening talk of his at a symposium entitled 'Physiology of Muscular Exercise' held in Dallas in 1966, in which he compiled the results of The Three Musketeers to elegantly formulate the concept of adaptive resetting of homeostasis during exercise (Asmussen, 1967): 'For every state of physical exercise, there is a carefully controlled level of pulmonary function, ventilation, cardiac output and deep body temperature. These levels are maintained at least as precisely as the resting level, and the controlling feedback systems are the same in exercise as during rest; only the set-point has been changed.' At the present day, it is evident that this adaptive resetting of homeostasis during exercise should be considered a universal phenomenon involving myriad neural and non-neural mechanisms, encompassed by the evolving concept of interorgan crosstalk (Hargreaves, 2021; Severinsen &amp; Pedersen, 2020). Returning to the questions posed at The League of Nations meeting in 1931, it is thus clear that exercise is not merely a disturbance that organ systems must counteract, eliciting abnormal or extreme responses. Rather, every organ of the healthy body is 'designed' to accommodate to the steady state of exercise, both in its own right and through its interaction with other organs&#8212;'one for all, and all for one!'
