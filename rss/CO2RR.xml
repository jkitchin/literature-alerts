                Utilizing sunlight for photoelectrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (PEC CO2 RR) is a carbon-neutral path to valuable liquid fuels. Higher quality photoabsorbers are needed to improve the efficiency of the PEC CO2 RR process. We show how the optoelectronic properties of sputtered ZnTe absorbers can be improved for this purpose via chloride treatments. MnCl2 and MgCl2 heat treatments recrystallize ZnTe absorbers to enlarge grains and improve photoluminescence. These material improvements result in the highest PEC CO2 RR photocurrent density reported for planar ZnTe and &gt;50% Faradaic efficiency to CO formation with diaryliodonium additive in the solution. These results pave the way to integration of polycrystalline thin-film photoabsorbers in PEC CO2 RR systems.</description>

                The rapid development of nanomaterial self-assembly technology has greatly favored the field of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and allowed for better control of catalyst structure and composition. Various self-assembly methods, such as DNA-directed assembly, matrix-assisted technology and solvent evaporation, have been used to improve catalytic efficiency and selectivity. Various newly created self-assembled catalysts have also contributed to the development of CO2RR, such as metal oxide catalysts, organic polymers and frameworks, organometallic frameworks and hybrid systems. This paper explored the application of the self-assembled nanocatalysts in CO2RR through a literature review and case studies, with an emphasis on how these methods can reduce CO2 to valuable products such as CO, methane and C2 compounds. The main results highlight the impact of self-assembled structures on improving reaction kinetics and product selectivity. The paper finds that self-assembly technologies and self-assembly nanocatalysts offer potential breakthroughs in improving CO reduction efficiency and contribute to the development of carbon capture and conversion technologies.</description>

                Human (anthropogenic) influence, mostly generalized industry, intensive conventional agriculture, traffic and others, causes the increase of concentration of greenhouse gases to a level by which significantly more heat is radiated back to the earth than it was in the initial state. This is how climate warming occurs. At the international level, periodic inventories are carried out that show the fact that the biosphere absorbs, approximately, half of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and at the terrestrial level, the carbon source and reserve is given by the northern hemisphere.This study presents some results from the literature regarding the methods of C emissions reduction and its sequestration per surface unit, i.e. per hectare of agricultural crops, to increase the contribution of agriculture to environmental depollution. The used methods included searching of databases, such as Web of Science or Google Scholar, in order to identify some relevant results.Reducing CO2 emissions can be achieved through biological, chemical and technological options, either by reducing or sequestering them.</description>

                Abstract Reducing carbon dioxide &#65288;CO 2 &#65289;to high&#8208;value products using green renewable energy is a promising approach for addressing energy and greenhouse effect issues. Consequently, electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) technology has become a current research hotspot. Since the discovery of the high activity and selectivity of copper in the CO 2 RR, atomically dispersed Cu catalysts have garnered widespread attention due to their efficient atom utilization, unique electronic structure, and outstanding catalytic performance. However, a great challenge remains in providing rational catalyst design principles to achieve the regulation of product distribution. A clear understanding of catalytic materials and an in&#8208;depth interpretation of the mechanism as well as the elucidation of the design strategy and research progress toward different products are the keys to building the understanding for solving the above problem. Therefore, this review starts with the introduction of advanced characterization techniques to reveal catalyst structure and reaction mechanisms. Then, various optimization strategies and the applications of atomically dispersed Cu catalysts in producing various high&#8208;value targeted products are summarized and discussed. Finally, the perspectives on atomically dispersed Cu catalysts in the CO 2 RR field toward future development are offered.</description>

                This work addresses fundamental questions that deepen our understanding of secondary coordination sphere effects on carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction using derivatized hydride analogues of the type, [Cp*Fe(diphosphine)H] (Cp* = C5Me5&#8208;) &#8211; a well&#8208;studied family of organometallic complex &#8211; as models. More precisely, we describe the general reactivity of [(Cp*&#8208;BR2)Fe(diphosphine)H], which contains an intramolecularly positioned Lewis acid, and its cooperative reactivity with CO2. Control experiments underscore the critical nature of borane incorporation for CO2 to reduced products, a reaction that does not occur for unfunctionalized [Cp*Fe(diphosphine)H]). Additional experiments highlight relevance of borane hybridization and substituent effects. Mechanistic studies performed in the presence and absence of CO2 emphasize the significance of carbonyl substrate to catalyst longevity. Lessons from these reactions were also transferable &#8211; with such borane&#8208;containing complexes enabling the chemoselective reduction of aldehydes in the presence of alkenes. These findings provide valuable insights into metal&#8208;ligand cooperative design strategies for carbonyl reduction and illustrate the versatility of intramolecularly positioned Lewis acids for otherwise challenging chemical transformations.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Modeling Study for the Solar-Driven CO2 Electrochemical Reduction to CO</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app15020549</link>
      <description>Matteo Agliuzza, Roberto Speranza, Andrea Lamberti, Candido Fabrizio Pirri, Adriano Sacco, Applied Sciences. 15(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406171439

                With the rising levels of atmospheric CO2, electrochemistry shows great promise in decarbonizing industrial processes by converting CO2 into valuable products through scalable and sustainable technologies. In this framework, the present study investigates the solar-driven CO2 reduction toward carbon monoxide, achieved by the integration between the electrochemical reactor and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), both in experimental and modeling perspectives. COMSOL&#174; Multiphysics 6.3 was used to develop a detailed finite element method model of the electrochemical cell integrated with a photovoltaic module, validated with the experimental results that demonstrated a strong correlation. A 2D model was designed, incorporating cathode and anode regions divided by an ion-exchange membrane. The model includes platinum foil and silver nanoparticles as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction and CO2 reduction reaction, respectively. Integration with the fundamental equations of the DSSCs was simulated to analyze the solar-driven CO2 reduction behavior under solar irradiance variations, offering a valuable tool for optimizing operating conditions and predicting the device performance under different environmental conditions. The integrated device successfully produces CO with a faradaic efficiency of 73.85% at a current density of J = 3.35 mA/cm2 under 1 sun illumination, with the result validated and reproduced by the mathematical model. Under reduced illumination conditions of 0.8 and 0.6 suns, faradaic efficiencies of 68.5% and 64.1% were achieved, respectively.</description>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate offers a promising pathway to mitigate the energy crisis and realize carbon neutrality. Bismuth (Bi), as a metal catalyst for the CO2RR, is considered to have great potential in producing formate, yet hindered in low current density and selectivity. Herein, we constructed an oxide-derived copper foam substrate (OD-Cu) to improve the electrocatalytic properties of Bi dendrites loaded on its surface. Bi electrodeposited on the OD-Cu (Bi/OD-Cu) grows as pinecone-like dendrites, exhibiting a high formate faradaic efficiency (FEformate) of 97.2% and a formate partial current density of ~24 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.97 V vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) in an H-cell. Notably, the Bi/OD-Cu electrode demonstrates an FEformate of 95.8% at &#8722;0.97 V vs. RHE and a total current density close to 90 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.17 V vs. RHE in a neutral flow cell. The experimental studies reveal that the remarkable CO2RR performance of the Bi/OD-Cu results from the electron transfer from Cu to Bi, which optimizes adsorption of the CO2&#8226;&#8722; and boosts reaction kinetics. This study emphasizes the crucial role of substrate engineering strategies in enhancing catalytic activity and shows the possibility for a porous metal electrode in advancing the industrialization of formate production.</description>

      <title>Heteroarchitectural Gas Diffusion Layer Promotes CO2 Reduction Coupled with Biomass Oxidation at Ampere&#8208;Level Current Density</title>

                Achieving high product selectivity at ampere&#8208;level current densities is essential for the industrial application of electrochemical CO2 reduction. However, the operational stability of CO2 electrolyzers at large current density has long been hindered by flooding of gas diffusion layer (GDL). Herein, a new heteroarchitectural GDL is designed to overcome flooding. Such GDL is constructed by sequentially sputtering the conductive silver and titanium boride (TiB2) onto a polytetrafluoroethylene substrate. Assembled with Cu catalyst in a flow cell, a maximum ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 64.7% was achieved at a current density of 1.2 A cm&#8722;2 in 6 M KOH. Furthermore, the GDL is capable of stable operation for over 40 hours at 400 mA cm&#8722;2. Theoretical calculations and in&#8208;situ experiments demonstrate enhanced intermediates adsorption on the TiB2&#8208;supported Cu surface, thereby reducing the energy barrier for C&#8208;C coupling. When coupling the CO2 reduction reaction with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction, Faradaic efficiencies of 49.2% for ethylene and 85.4% for 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid were achieved at 1.2 A cm&#8722;2. This work provides a highly stable GDL for efficient CO2 conversion at ampere&#8208;level current density and paves the way for integrating biomolecules conversion in stack&#8208;level devices.</description>

      <title>Driving environmental sustainability in the EU specialized milk farms: Strategic CO2 emission reductions for a greener future</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/00307270241300340</link>

                This study assesses the environmental efficiences of specialized milk farms across the European Union (EU) countries, with a focus on CO2 emissions reduction. Using Tone's model under the assumption of generalized returns to scale, the analysis reveals an average environmental efficiency score of 0.599. Countries like Malta, Ireland, Italy, and the Netherlands have achieved full environmental efficiency, exemplifying optimal environmental performance. In contrast, countries such as Slovakia and Estonia demonstrate lower efficiency, suggesting significant opportunities for emission reductions. Czechia, Bulgaria, and Estonia show environmental efficiency levels ranging from 0.24 to 0.30. In contrast, Finland, Portugal, Romania, Lithuania, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, and Slovenia have achieved efficiency levels that fall between the average of 0.30 and a value of 0.599. The study highlights that higher populated and higher-income countries tend to exhibit higher environmental efficiency. The findings suggest that to improve environmental efficiency, milk production should be concentrated in larger farms, with an emphasis on sustainable agricultural practices, advanced technologies, and efficient resource management. Furthermore, the study recommends targeted policies and strategies to enhance environmental efficiency, particularly in countries with lower population densities and incomes. These strategies include transitioning to pasture-grazing systems, improving nitrogen use efficiency, enhancing animal welfare, and investing in advanced farming technologies. The study underscores the importance of integrating environmental considerations into broader agricultural policies to achieve sustainability in the specialized milk farms of the EU.</description>

                Reactions of 1,2-dimagnesioethane compound [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-C2H4)] (TCHPNON = 4,5-bis(2,4,6-tricyclohexylanilido)-2,7-diethyl-9,9-dimethyl-xanthene), formed by the two-electron reduction of ethene with a dimagnesium/dipotassium complex of reduced N2, viz. [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-N2)], with CO and CO2 have been explored. In the case of the reaction with CO, cross-coupling of the reduced ethene fragment with two molecules of CO gave a heterobimetallic complex of the parent cyclobutenediolate dianion, [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-O2C4H4)], which when exposed to THF gave adduct [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-O2C4H4)(THF)]. Treating [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-C2H4)] with CO2 led to insertion of CO2 into both Mg&#8210;C bonds and all Mg&#8210;N bonds of the 1,2-dimagnesioethane species, yielding a magnesium succinate complex, [{K(TCHPNON-C2O4)Mg}2(-O4C4H4)], in which the diamide ligands of the starting material have been converted to xanthene bridged dicarbamates. The reactions can be viewed as involving the &#8220;masked-magnesium(I)&#8221; induced cross-coupling of ethene with either CO or CO2, to give more complex organic products. Reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-N2)] with CO2, proceeded via reductive coupling of the heterocumulene to give the oxalate dianion, in addition to insertion of CO2 into all Mg&#8210;N bonds of the magnesium-dinitrogen complex, forming dimeric [{K(TCHPNON-C2O4)Mg}2(-O4C2)]2. When treated with THF this dissociates to monomeric [{K(THF)(TCHPNON-C2O4)Mg(THF)}2(-O4C2)]. Related chemistry results from the reaction of a dianionic magnesium(I) compound with CO2. In contrast, C&#8210;C bond formation was not observed in the reaction of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-N2)] with a CO2 analogue, i.e. the carbodiimide CyNCNCy (Cy = cyclohexyl). Instead, H abstraction by a proposed intermediate containing a reduced carbodiimide radical fragment, gave polymeric formamidinate complex [K(TCHPNON)Mg{(CyN)2CH}]&#8734;. Reaction of CO2 with the magnesium hydride complex [{K(TCHPNON)Mg(-H)}2] (formed by activation of H2 with [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-N2)]), gave the unusual trimeric magnesium formate complex [{K(TCHPNON-CO2)Mg}(-O2CH)]3 in which CO2 has inserted into only one Mg&#8210;N bond of each TCHPNON ligand. All of the above-mentioned reactions reveal the capacity of [{K(TCHPNON)Mg}2(-N2)] to act as a masked dimagnesium(I) diradical in reductive coupling or cross-coupling of the simple gaseous reagents, C2H4, CO, CO2 and H2, to give value-added organic fragments.</description>

                Low&#8208;cost Cu2O with a suitable band gap holds great potential for solar utilization. However severe photocorrosion and weak CO2 capture capability have significantly hindered their application in artificial photosynthesis. Herein, polyoxometalate (POM)&#8208;etching and in situ growth of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) can simultaneously incorporate electron&#8208;sponge and HKUST protective layer into Cu2O. The resulting ternary composites Cu2O@POM@HKUST&#8208;n (POM = PMo12O40 and PW12O40) with dual hetero&#8208;interfaces can efficiently convert CO2 to HCOOH with 5226 &#181;mol g&#8208;1 yield, over 5 and 55 times higher than that of Cu2O (1010 &#181;mol g&#8208;1) and Cu2O@HKUST (95.02 &#181;mol g&#8208;1). In situ XPS and DFT studies reveal that Cu mainly existed in the form of Cu2O and Cu&#8208;MOF, while a unique Cux+ (1&lt; x &#8804;2) surface layer formed upon the Cu2O matrix surrounding POMs for CO2 absorption and activation. Systematic investigations demonstrate that the electron&#8208;sponge can efficiently capture electrons from excited Cu2O to promote the generation of a Cux+ surface layer, while the closely surface&#8208;coating metal&#8208;organic layer can act as protective layer and CO2 adsorbent. This dual function concurrently contributes to promote photocatalysis and prevent Cu2O degradation. Remarkably, the ternary composites exhibit much enhanced photochemical stability and can be used for over 60 h without noticeable activity loss.</description>

This dual function concurrently contributes to promote photocatalysis and prevent Cu2O degradation. Remarkably, the ternary composites exhibit much enhanced photochemical stability and can be used for over 60 h without noticeable activity loss.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is an important application that can considerably mitigate environmental and energy crises. However, the slow proton-coupled electron transfer process continues to limit overall catalytic performance. Fine-tuning the reaction microenvironment by accurately constructing the local structure of catalysts provides a novel approach to enhancing reaction kinetics. Here, cubic-phase &#945;-MoC1&#8722;x nanoparticles were incorporated into a carbon matrix and coupled with cobalt phthalocyanine molecules (&#945;-MoC1&#8722;x&#8211;CoPc@C) for the co-reduction of CO2 and H2O, achieving an impressive Faradaic efficiency for CO close to 100%. Through a combination of in-situ spectroscopies, electrochemical measurements, and theoretical simulations, it is demonstrated that &#945;-MoC1&#8722;x nanoparticles and CoPc molecules with the optimized local configuration serve as the active centers for H2O activation and CO2 reduction, respectively. The interfacial water molecules were rearranged, forming a dense hydrogen bond network on the catalyst surface. This optimized microenvironment at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface synergistically enhanced water dissociation, accelerated proton transfer, and improved the overall performance of CO2RR.</description>

      <title>Forecasting US data center CO2 emissions using AI models: emissions reduction strategies and policy recommendations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/frsus.2024.1507030</link>

                Data centers are poised for unprecedented growth due to a revolution in Artificial Intelligence (AI), rise in cryptocurrency mining, and increasing cloud demand for data storage. A sizable portion of the data centers&#8217; growth will occur in the US, requiring a tremendous amount of power. Our hypothesis is that the expansion of data centers will contribute to an increase in US CO 2 emissions. To estimate CO 2 emissions, we applied three forecasted power demands for data centers and applied 56 NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) power mixes and policy scenario cases using 11 AI models. Among these, the linear regression model yielded the most accurate predictions with the highest R-square. We found that overall CO 2 emissions in the US could increase up to 0.4&#8211;1.9% due to expansion of data centers by 2030. This increase represents ~3&#8211;14% of CO 2 emissions from the US power sector by 2030. Using the state-level power mix forecasts for 2030 among increasing CO 2 emission scenarios, we predict that Virginia&#8217;s power mix will maintain emissions in line with the US average, while the Texas, Illinois, and Washington&#8217;s power mix are expected to reduce emissions due to greater renewables in their power mix in 2030. However, Illinois and Washington may face challenges due to their limited power resource availability. In contrast, New York and California&#8217;s power mix may increase CO 2 emissions due to higher natural gas in their power mix in 2030. The highest variability in data center CO 2 emissions stems from AI-driven demand and improvements in data center efficiency and is followed by the power mix. To reduce CO 2 emissions from data centers, we offer pathways such as reducing power consumption, improving power mix with renewable sources, and using hydrogen in power plants. We propose focusing on New Mexico and Colorado for data centers to minimize CO 2 emissions. Finally, we highlight a set of federal policies supplemented by states to facilitate CO 2 emission reductions across energy, emissions, waste, R&amp;amp;D, and grid infrastructure.</description>

                Abstract The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) is required to convert CO2 into useful commodity chemicals with renewable energy thereby reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. We report significantly enhanced CRR activity by incorporating the s-donating, e- reservoir ligand Imdye (1-imidazole-2,4,6-tri(carbazol-9-yl)-3,5-dicyanobenzene) within the complex fac-[MnI(bpy)(CO)3(Imdye)]+ (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine). The reduction potentials of Imdye, MnI/0, and CO2 to CO are close, allowing the active catalyst [Mn0(bpy)(CO)2(Imdye-)]- to provide 2e- to CO2 at small overpotentials. This system reduces CO2 to CO with bulk turnover numbers up to 830 very near the CRR reduction potential. This CRR activity arose from Imdye promoting the CRR at small overpotentials, and from utilizing the electrooxidation of CH3OH/H2O to CO2, 6H+ and 6e- at the Pt counter electrode, neutralizing pH changes from the CRR. These strategies will apply to most CRR electrocatalytic systems.</description>

                One of the risks associated with climate change is carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, which can negatively affect human health and the ecosystem. The CO2 emission can lead to a decline in urban area quality that surpasses the environment's carrying capacity. This research aimed to investigate the relationship between CO2 Emissions from Transportation (X1), Household (X2), and Business Sector (X3) with the CO2 reduction of green open space (Y). The hypothesis is that there is a negative correlation between CO2 emissions from transportation, households, and businesses and CO2 reduction from green open spaces. A quantitative research design was adopted using the Slovin formula and cluster random sampling. The Normality and Homogeneity Tests are used to analyze research data. The study yielded the following results: first, the coefficient of determination (r2) = 0.003 indicates a relationship between CO2 emissions from transportation with CO2 reduction from green open space, with a 0.3% contribution. The second finding is that there is a 0.1% contribution from CO2 reduction from green open space to the CO2 emissions of households, as indicated by the coefficient of determination (r2) = 0.001. Third, a correlation of 0.1% between CO2 reduction from green open space and CO2 emissions from the Business Sector is indicated by the coefficient of determination (r2) = 0.001. Thus, using the regression equation Y = 2320.432 &#8211; 0.16X1 &#8211; 0,25 X2 &#8211; 0,007 X3, there is an overall significant relationship between CO2 emissions from transportation, CO2 emissions from households, and CO2 emissions from the business sector with the reduction of CO2 from green open space.</description>

                The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) presents a promising solution for mitigating CO2 emissions while producing valuable chemical feedstocks. Although single&#8208;atom catalysts have shown potential in selectively converting CO2 to CH4, their limited active sites often hinder the realization of high current densities, posing a selectivity&#8208;activity dilemma. In this study, we developed a single&#8208;atom cobalt (Co) doped copper catalyst (Co1Cu) that achieved a CH4 Faradaic efficiency exceeding 60% with a partial current density of &#8208;482.7 mA cm&#8208;2. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the incorporation of single Co atoms enhances the activation and dissociation of H2O molecules, thereby lowering the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of *CO intermediates. In situ spectroscopic experiments and density functional theory simulations further demonstrated that the modulation of the *CO adsorption configuration, with stronger bridge&#8208;binding, favours deep reduction to CH4 over the C&#8208;C coupling or CO desorption pathways. Our findings underscore the potential of Co1Cu catalysts in overcoming the selectivity&#8208;activity trade&#8208;off, paving the way for efficient and scalable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 conversion technologies.</description>

                Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion to value-added, highly reduced chemicals such as methanol (CH3OH) is a promising possibility for producing renewable fuel and simultaneous CO2 recycling. However, this process remains a challenge, with only a few selective electrocatalysts known. Here, we present a study of a palladium monolayer on a platinum (111) single crystal (PdML/Pt(111)) as an electrocatalyst for CO2 conversion to CH3OH. A custom-made setup was employed in order to detect and quantify gaseous and liquid CO2 reduction products in sufficient concentrations despite the limitations of working with a single-crystalline electrode. Under ambient reaction conditions, a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 1.5% at &#8722;0.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) was obtained while using CO2 as the reactant. Other reaction intermediates, carbon monoxide (CO) and formaldehyde (HCHO) were subsequently used as reactants, leading to FEs of 1.8 and 2.5%, respectively, whereas formic acid is not reduced. The corresponding mechanism concluded from our work is compared to the literature. The electrocatalyst introduced here, with a highly well-defined structure for CO2 conversion to CH3OH, opens up possibilities for further catalytic explorations.</description>

      <title>Abundant and active acetogens enhance the carbon dioxide sink of Blue Carbon ecosystems</title>

                Blue Carbon ecosystems, which include all tidal wetlands, mitigate climate change by capturing and storing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Most carbon fixation in these systems is thought to be driven by plant and microbial photosynthesis, whereas chemosynthetic processes are assumed to play a minor role. However, these ecosystems often contain anoxic environments ideal for chemosynthetic microbes such as acetogens. Here, we show that acetogens are abundant and active mediators of carbon sequestration in tidal wetland soils by pairing gene- and genome-resolved metagenomic analysis with isolation and analysis of gas-fermenting acetogens in bioreactors. Metagenomic profiling revealed that diverse microbes can mediate carbon fixation, primarily through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle and Wood-Ljungdahl pathways. These include various bacteria and archaea capable of reductive acetogenesis. On this basis, we grew bacterial enrichment cultures from tidal wetland soils using the gases hydrogen and CO2 as the sole energy and carbon sources. Bioreactor analysis revealed that these enrichments are dominated by clostridial acetogens that grow rapidly by converting CO2 into acetate and other products. Collectively, these results reveal Blue Carbon ecosystems harbour communities that can exclusively subsist by using CO2 as their sole electron acceptor and for carbon fixation, thereby providing evidence of a novel carbon sink pathway within these ecosystems beyond the known mechanisms of photosynthetic carbon fixation and soil sequestration. Additionally, the discovery and isolation of these chemosynthetic communities provide opportunities for developing further mechanisms of CO2 removal through industrial gas fermentation.</description>

                The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) is one of the most promising ways to valorise CO2 as a source of carbon. The development of novel, efficient and scalable catalysts for CO2 electroreduction in electrolysers is still a big challenge. This paper reports on the preparation of sustainable, efficient, and stable gas diffusion electrodes utilizing silver as catalyst for the CO2 electroreduction to CO. The catalyst is prepared by sputter deposition and subsequent surface modification by oxygen plasma. It is uniformly deposited as a thin layer on the hydrophobic porous structure of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), minimizing the amount of silver required and simultaneously addressing the problem of substrate flooding by the electrolyte. This leads to a synergetic, beneficial impact on the CO2RR, as evaluated in a flow reactor with gas-fed CO2. The optimized gas diffusion electrodes, with high porosity and electrochemical surface area, show high activity at low overpotentials, faradaic efficiency for CO over 90% and stability tested over periods up to 24 hours. This approach allows for high performance using a minimal amount of metal, while exploiting the processing advantages of sputtering as an industrial state-of-the-art, high-throughput technique.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Summertime Trends in Vehicle Combustion Efficiency in Los Angeles, CA and Salt Lake City, UT</title>

                Policy interventions and technological advances are mitigating emissions of air pollutants from motor vehicles. As a result, vehicle fleets are expected to progressively combust fuel more efficiently, with a declining ratio of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide (CO/CO2) in their emissions. We assess trends in traffic combustion efficiency in Los Angeles (LA) and Salt Lake City (SLC) by measuring changes in summertime on-road CO/CO2 between 2013 and 2021 using mobile observations. Our data show a reduction in CO/CO2 in LA, indicating an improvement in combustion efficiency that likely resulted from stringent regulation of CO emissions. In contrast, we observed an increase in CO/CO2 values in SLC. While slower progress in SLC compared to LA may be partially due to a later adoption of vehicle emission regulations in Utah compared to California, differing driving conditions and fleet composition may also be playing a role. This is evidenced by increased CO/CO2 in LA during the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to faster driving speeds and changes to the fleet composition. Our results demonstrate the success of California's CO-reducing policy interventions and illustrate the impacts of traffic characteristics on vehicle combustion efficiency and air pollutant emissions.</description>

                Abstract The combined effect of the operating pressure and supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) injection level on structure development during puffing of milk protein concentrate by supercritical fluid extrusion was studied. The extrudates were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy, texture analyzer, and electrophoresis. Extrudates obtained with SC-CO2 injection rate corresponding to the equilibrium solubility demonstrated a highly porous structure (mean pore size &amp;lt; 500 &#956;m, mean pore wall thickness &amp;lt; 40 &#956;m). In contrast, both undersaturated and oversaturated conditions formed extrudates having fewer large irregular pores (mean pore size &amp;gt; 700 &#956;m, mean pore wall thickness &amp;gt; 80 &#956;m). Reduction in interfacial tension with increasing CO2 concentration favored homogeneous nucleation up to saturation CO2 levels, resulting in uniformly porous extrudates. SC-CO2 input rate above the saturation levels resulted in undissolved gas vacuoles in the melt, allowing dissolved CO2 to diffuse into them at die exit, favoring coalescence. These findings could have significant utility in designing novel milk protein-based puffed products of predefined structural and physicochemical properties.</description>

                Besides the goal of net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, the reduction of aviation's climate impact requires the mitigation of its other forcing effects, most importantly the avoidance of warming condensation trails (contrails). From current understanding a decrease of both, soot and water vapor emissions from aircraft engines yields a reduced occurrence and persistence of contrails and contrail cirrus, reducing their radiative forcing. The WaterEnhanced Turbofan (WET) for instance is one concept that achieves both effects through water recovery from the engine exhaust and particle washout. In this first set of simplified sensitivity studies applying the established Contrail Cirrus Prediction (CoCiP) tool, we simulate and assess the impact of potential soot number and water vapor emission reductions on contrail radiative effect and optical properties in an application scenario in Europe. We find a non-linear impact of the soot particle reduction, which is strongest if soot number concentration is reduced by more than one order of magnitude compared to current engines. For water vapor, a large impact on contrail radiative effect is achieved by a reduction of one order of magnitude. Both effects can be combined almost independently. Therefore, we expect a significant decrease in contrail radiative effect if WET-like technologies were applied to a broad fleet. Nevertheless, other contrail nucleation pathways like condensation on volatile particles have not been considered in this study.</description>

      <title>Effects of modulating probiotics on greenhouse gas emissions and yield in rice paddies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.17221/299/2024-pse</link>
      <description>S. Pao, Huixin Wu, H. Y. Hsieh, Chang-Po Chen, Hsing&#8208;Juh Lin, Plant Soil and Environment. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406150198

                Rice serves as a crucial staple food for nearly half of the world's population. However, rice paddies contribute remarkably to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Prior studies often showed a trade-off between reducing GHG emissions and impairing rice yield. In this study, we explore the possibility of employing modulating probiotics to develop a win-win strategy for enhancing rice yields while reducing GHG emissions. Three paired plots of rice paddies were used in the field experiment during the spring growing season (from February to July 2022). Each pair of plots was divided into control and probiotic addition paddies to investigate the effects of modulating probiotic treatment on GHG emissions using the whole-plant chambers. Our results revealed notable reductions in GHG emissions and increases in rice yield with the probiotic treatment relative to the control. The probiotic treatment resulted in a 47.58% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, a 21.53% reduction in methane (CH4) emissions, and an impressive 88.50% reduction in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions over the growing season. We also observed a 27.75% increase in rice yield with the probiotic treatment. These findings suggest that employing modulating probiotics has the potential to pave the way for mutually beneficial outcomes, enhancing rice productivity while mitigating the GHG emissions associated with rice cultivation.</description>

      <title>CO&#8322; Concentration and Global Temperature: Missing Experimental Evidence</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.9734/bpi/geserh/v3/3633</link>
      <description>Andrej Pusti&#353;ek, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406132419

                Understanding the role of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in influencing global temperature is essential to the contemporary debate about anthropogenic global warming. Human activities releasing greenhouse gases are identified as dominant contributors to the observed climate change, including global warming and its acceleration. The consequences for humanity are predicted to be severe. Therefore, to mitigate global warming, significant efforts are being devoted to reducing CO2 emissions and stabilizing (or even reducing) atmospheric CO2 concentration. Various countries are taking measures to curtail the utilization of fossil fuels, i.e., coal, oil products, and natural gas, with the intent of transforming the transportation, heating, and energy sectors. This enormous endeavor of 'decarbonization' comes with substantial costs, running into trillions of USD in Western countries alone. Fundamentally, the entirety of endeavors, actions, and outcomes hinges upon the central hypothesis stating that the increase of CO2 concentration from approximately 0.03% to more than 0.04% causes a noticeable temperature rise. Given the paramount significance of this hypothesis, the generally accepted rules of science would necessitate rigorous scrutiny for substantiation. Such substantiation is typically provided by experimental evidence. Yet, surprisingly according to the results of this research, exactly this essential experimental evidence supporting the central hypothesis seems to be lacking, not fully adhering to fundamental principles of scientific analysis. Consequently, robust experimental evidence must be presented to substantiate the hypothesis, as the failure to do so would necessitate a reassessment of the emphasis on CO2 emissions reduction as the primary solution to climate change. The discussion about this subject should be conducted objectively, fair, and open-mindedly, embracing diverse perspectives.</description>

      <title>Using OCO-2 Observations to Constrain Regional CO2 Fluxes Estimated with the Vegetation, Photosynthesis and Respiration Model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/rs17020177</link>
      <description>I. B. Konovalov, Nikolai A. Golovushkin, E. A. Mareev, Remote Sensing. 17(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406125544

                A good quantitative knowledge of regional sources and sinks of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for understanding the global carbon cycle. It is also a key prerequisite for elaborating cost-effective national strategies to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. However, available estimates of CO2 fluxes for many regions of the world remain uncertain, despite significant recent progress in the remote sensing of terrestrial vegetation and atmospheric CO2. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of inferring reliable regional estimates of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) using column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 (XCO2) retrieved from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) observations as constraints on parameters of the widely used Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration model (VPRM), which predicts ecosystem fluxes based on vegetation indices derived from multispectral satellite imagery. We developed a regional-scale inverse modeling system that applies a Bayesian variational optimization algorithm to optimize parameters of VPRM coupled to the CHIMERE chemistry transport model and which involves a preliminary transformation of the input XCO2 data that reduces the impact of the CHIMERE boundary conditions on inversion results. We investigated the potential of our inversion system by applying it to a European region (that includes, in particular, the EU countries and the UK) for the warm season (May&#8211;September) of 2021. The inversion of the OCO-2 observations resulted in a major (more than threefold) reduction of the prior uncertainty in the regional NEE estimate. The posterior NEE estimate agrees with independent estimates provided by the CarbonTracker Europe High-Resolution (CTE-HR) system and the ensemble of the v10 OCO-2 model intercomparison (MIP) global inversions. We also found that the inversion improves the agreement of our simulations of XCO2 with retrievals from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). Our sensitivity test experiments using synthetic XCO2 data indicate that the posterior NEE estimate would remain reliable even if the actual regional CO2 fluxes drastically differed from their prior values. Furthermore, the posterior NEE estimate is found to be robust to strong biases and random uncertainties in the CHIMERE boundary conditions. Overall, this study suggests that our approach offers a reliable and relatively simple way to derive robust estimates of CO2 ecosystem fluxes from satellite XCO2 observations while enhancing the applicability of VPRM in regions where eddy covariance measurements of CO2 fluxes are scarce.</description>

      <title>Potential and costs required for methane removal to compete with BECCS as a mitigation option</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ada813</link>
      <description>Yann Gaucher, Katsumasa Tanaka, Daniel Johansson, Olivi&#233;r Boucher, Philippe Ciais, Environmental Research Letters. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406206510

                Abstract Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas causing warming after carbon dioxide, and the emission reductions potentials are known to be limited due to the difficulty of abating agricultural methane. We explore in this study the emerging option of atmospheric methane removal (MR) that could complement carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in mitigation pathways. MR is technologically very challenging and potentially very expensive, so the main question is at which cost per ton of methane removed is MR more cost effective than CDR. To address this question, we use an intertemporal optimization climate-GHG-energy model to evaluate the MR cost and removal potential thresholds that would allow us to meet a given climate target with the same or a lower abatement cost and allowing for equal or higher gross CO2 emissions than if CDR through BECCS were an option. We also compare the effects of MR and CDR on the cost-effective mitigation pathways achieving four different climate targets. Using the ACC2-GET integrated carbon cycle, atmospheric chemistry, climate and energy system model, we consider a generic MR technology characterized by a given unit cost and a maximal removal potential. We show that to totally replace bioenergy based CDR with MR, the MR potential should reach at least 180 to 290 MtCH4 per year, i.e., between 50% and 90% of current anthropogenic methane emissions, with maximum unit cost between 11,000 and 69,000 $/tCH4, depending on the climate target. Finally, we found that replacing CDR by MR reshapes the intergenerational distribution of climate mitigation efforts by delaying further the mitigation burden.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Manufacturing Practices for Zero-Emission Vehicles: Analyzing the Role of Predictive Analytics in Achieving Carbon Neutrality</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5024423</link>
      <description>Shakir Syed, SSRN Electronic Journal. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406208051

                Reducing production-related carbon dioxide emissions is a crucial prerequisite for achieving the European goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. This study provides an overview of possible emissions by using a current vehicle and the corresponding expressions, as well as the options that need to be addressed. Since industry contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, the effect of manufacturing emissions on all stages of a vehicle's lifecycle is noticeable. Predictive maintenance is called "new oil," and the application of advanced analytics is considered the driving source of a fundamental change at the production site. In addition to the early prediction of defects and the reduction of downtime and lower repair costs, one possible application is dealing with increased demand for zero-emission vehicle production to gain carbon neutrality in manufacturing. This essay aims to address sustainable manufacturing practices regarding zero-emission vehicles. The focus of the research is placed on the car industry, but the presented research could be utilized as the basis of application in any common car production. Since vehicle manufacturing is more pollution-inclined than the vehicle's use, it is essential to find an energy source that will sustain this industry's growth and, at the same time, respect the environment and keep pollutants practically zero. This is why, in this essay, electric-powered vehicles are outlined to substitute cars powered by conventional internal combustion drives, as they do not consume liquids and do not emit CO2 or other harmful gases. In addition to the benefits in terms of the environment, they are cleaner and generally healthier for the people who use them and eco-friendly, which is the goal of the project from every perspective of modern society. The application of advanced analytics is suitable not merely for energy development or sustainability; precisely, the intelligence could also be used in the production of systems. However, if power is a kind of energy, this paper will focus on its application in aspects of car industry production. The overall aim can be defined as an analysis of the benefits and downsides of using predictive analytics to improve the environmental aspects of the production domain by providing cleaner cars. The importance of corresponding illustrations is emphasized, and the essay ends with the connection between the importance of the industry's contribution from an environmental point of view and the necessity for sustainability aspects.</description>

      <title>Interactive Effects of Salinity, Redox State, Soil Type, and Colloidal Size Fractionation on Greenhouse Gas Production in Coastal Wetland Soils</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.170158332.29336750/v2</link>

                Coastal wetlands, including freshwater systems near large lakes, rapidly bury carbon, but less is known about how they transport carbon either to marine and lake environments or to the atmosphere as greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide and methane. This study examines how GHG production and organic matter (OM) mobility in coastal wetland soils vary with the availability of oxygen and other terminal electron acceptors. We also evaluated how OM and redox-sensitive species varied across different size fractions: particulates (0.45&#8211;1&#956;m), fine colloids (0.1&#8211;0.45&#956;m), and nano particulates plus truly soluble (&lt;0.1&#956;m; NP+S) during 21-day aerobic and anaerobic slurry incubations. Soils were collected from the center of a freshwater coastal wetland (FW-C) in Lake Erie, the upland-wetland edge of the same wetland (FW-E), and the center of a saline coastal wetland (SW-C) in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Anaerobic methane production for FW-E soils were 47 and 27,537 times greater than FW-C and SW-C soils, respectively. High Fe2+ and dissolved sulfate concentrations in FW-C and SW-C soils suggest that iron and/or sulfate reduction inhibited methanogenesis. Aerobic CO2 production was highest for both freshwater soils, which had a higher proportion of OM in the NP+S fraction (64&#177;28% and 70&#177;10% for FW-C and FW-E, respectively) and organic C:N ratios reflective of microbial detritus (5.3&#177;5.3 and 5.3&#177;7.0 for FW-E and FW-C, respectively) compared to SW-C, which had a higher fraction of particulate (58&#177;9%) and fine colloidal (19&#177;7%) OM and organic C:N ratios reflective of vegetation detritus (11.4 &#177; 1.7). The variability in GHG production and shifts in OM size fractionation and composition observed across freshwater and saline soils collected within individual and across different sites reinforce the high spatial variability in the processes controlling OM stability, mobility, and bioavailability in coastal wetland soils.</description>

      <title>What Impact Does Net Zero Action on Road Transport and Building Heating Have on Exposure to UK Air Pollution?</title>

                This study explores the cobenefits of reduced nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter (PM), through net zero (NZ) climate policy in the UK. Two alternative NZ scenarios, the balanced net zero (BNZP) and widespread innovation (WI) pathways, from the UK Climate Change Committee's Sixth Carbon Budget, were examined using a chemical transport model (CTM). Under the UK existing policy, Business as Usual (BAU), reductions in NO2 and PM were predicted by 2030 due to new vehicle technologies but plateau by 2040. The BNZP and WI scenarios show further reductions particularly by 2040, driven by accelerated electric vehicle (EV) uptake and low-carbon heating in buildings, with the building contribution to PM reduction being 2&#8211;3 times greater than road transport. The results demonstrate that the NZ transition to EVs (cars and vans) reduces both exhaust and nonexhaust emissions, as well as reducing traffic volumes. O3 trends are complex with a small overall increase by 2030 and a decrease by 2040. Although uncertain, 2050 predictions of BNZP showed important additional air pollution benefits. Our findings highlight the efficacy of NZ strategies, providing insights for UK and international policymakers interested in the air pollution cobenefits of climate policy.</description>

                Given the consequences of military actions in Ukraine and global and national goals to achieve decarbonization across all sectors of the economy, the authors evaluate opportunities for low-carbon recovery of the construction sector. In particular, an analysis of the impact of providing a highly energy-efficient building thermal envelope and its heat supply using renewable energy sources during the modernization of the existing administrative building in Ukraine to the level of the requirements of the European Union was carried out. This analysis considered economic, technical, and environmental factors. Thus, the authors present the results of dynamic modeling of the building's energy consumption at different levels of building insulation and make a payback forecast for improving the thermal envelope and using various sources of heat supply (including using a heat pump and a pellet boiler). To assess emissions reduction of the proposed building modernization options, an analysis of the existing national methods of calculating carbon dioxide emissions was carried out, and the option of a combination of a heat pump and photovoltaic panels was considered.</description>

                Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have garnered considerable attention owing to their profound potential in promoting the efficient utilization of metal resources and attaining atomic-level economy. Fe, Co, Ni SACs have demonstrated broad application prospects in electrocatalysis due to their tunable composition and structure, as well as their unique electronic properties. Firstly, the various preparation methods for Fe, Co, Ni SACs are outlined in this review, including high-temperature pyrolysis, impregnation, chemical vapor deposition, and atomic layer deposition. These methods not only enhance the utilization efficiency of metal atoms but also ensure the stability of the catalysts. Subsequently, this review summarizes the recent progress in the applications of Fe, Co, Ni SACs for electrocatalysis, with a particular focus on their efficacy in hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction. Despite remarkable advancements, Fe, Co, Ni SACs still face challenges related to large-scale production, stability enhancement, comprehensive characterization, and mechanistic exploration. Finally, this review discusses these challenges and proposes strategies to address them in order to fully realize the potential of Fe, Co, Ni SACs as high-performance catalysts.</description>

      <title>Influencing Mechanisms of Ecosystem Services on Net Carbon Sink Efficiency and Spatial Differentiation Thereof: A Case Study of the Shanghai Metropolitan Area</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3724/j.fjyl.202407160389</link>
      <description>Haiyan Song, Wang Min, Landscape Architecture. 32(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406133980

                Objective Ecosystem services are the link between ecosystems and social systems. While effectively coordinating regional ecological, social and economic needs and promoting carbon sequestration and emission reduction, ecosystem services can be transmitted to surrounding areas to boost regional ecological space optimization. Under the guidance of the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, clarifying the positive impact of ecosystem services on net carbon sink efficiency in metropolitan areas and the spillover effect of ecosystem services can effectively contribute to regional ecosystem service enhancement, and realize efficient carbon sequestration and reduction in ecological space. Methods Supported by multi-source panel data spanning the period from 2010 to 2020, this research takes the Shanghai Metropolitan Area as the research object and divides the research area into 40 research units. Based on the multiple benefits of ecosystem services in synergistically promoting urban sink enhancement and emission reduction, this research constructs a net carbon sink efficiency indicator system. Then, utilizing the undesirable slacks-based measurement (SBM) model, the research evaluates the net carbon sink efficiency of each unit during the period from 2010 to 2020, and further explores the distributional characteristics and spatial-temporal changes of carbon sinks, carbon emissions, and net carbon sink efficiency from the geospatial perspective. In combination with the guiding content of spatial synergistic planning for the Shanghai Metropolitan Area, four important ecosystem services, namely water retention, water purification, soil retention and biodiversity maintenance, are quantitatively characterized with the InVEST model. Subsequently, based on the spatial decomposition effects (direct, indirect and total effects) obtained with spatial econometric model, the influencing mechanisms of ecosystem services and their interrelationship on the net carbon sink efficiency of 40 research units are analyzed. In addition, the spatial spillover effects of ecosystem services are innovatively revealed according to ecosystem service flow conduction mechanisms. Results Research results are summarized as follows. 1) During the 11 years from the 2010 to 2020, the growth of carbon dioxide emissions in the Shanghai Metropolitan Area gradually slowed down, while the net primary productivity of vegetation continued to increase, and the areas with high carbon emissions and high carbon sinks were partially overlapped; in addition, the net carbon sink efficiency of some core nodes, such as Shanghai City, maintained a steady improvement, effectively driving neighboring cities to reduce carbon emissions and increase carbon sinks; meanwhile, the areas with improved net carbon sink efficiency have some similar characteristics and can be divided into 2 types: areas with high production value, high carbon emissions, and high carbon sinks, and those with medium-high production value, low carbon emissions, and medium-high carbon sinks. 2) The four ecosystem services have significant spatial heterogeneity and relatively stable changes over the 11-year period, with the high values mainly distributed in the southwestern part of the area with high vegetation cover and the area around the Taihu Lake with concentrated water resources, while the low values mainly distributed in the concentrated urban construction areas and near the regional traffic arteries, and the total amount of the four ecosystem services has shown fluctuating characteristics. 3) Regarding the spatial decomposition effects of ecosystem services on net carbon sink efficiency, there are differences in the coefficients, directions and significance of the spatial effects of different ecosystem services. For the ecosystem service trade-off index and relationship index, the direct effects are significantly positive, while indirect effects significantly negative. Conclusion The research clarifies that water-related ecosystem services such as water retention and water purification services can significantly affect carbon reduction and sink enhancement in the Shanghai Metropolitan Area, and attention should be paid to water network system and its coupling effects with green and grey spaces, so as to further stimulate the ecological vitality of Jiangnan water vein. As there are differences in the spillover effects of different ecosystem services, it is necessary to differentiate the optimization and enhancement strategies for each type of ecological space and its ecosystem services according to local conditions, and the conservation of important ecological spaces in the metropolitan area should be continuously strengthened, followed by joint protection and control of ecological red lines in neighboring areas, so as to promote territorial spatial carbon reduction and sink enhancement activities, thus contributing to the steady improvement of the net carbon sink efficiency of the Shanghai Metropolitan Area in general. The research clearly demonstrates the positive effects of enhancing water-related ecosystem services and conserving important ecological spaces on regional carbon sinks and reduction, and effectively reveals an effective path for synergistic carbon reduction in the region, which may provide certain reference for improving territorial spatial management. </description>

                The Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2&#176;C requires drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the balancing of any remaining emissions by carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Due to uncertainties about the potential and durability of many land-based approaches to deliver sufficient CDR, marine CDR options are receiving more and more interest. We present the current state of knowledge regarding the potentials, risks, side effects as well as challenges associated with technical feasibility, governance, monitoring, reporting and accounting of marine CDR, covering a range of biotic and geochemical approaches. We specifically discuss to what extent a comparison with direct injection of CO 2 into seawater, which had been proposed decades ago and is now prohibited by international agreements, may provide guidance for evaluating some of the biotic marine CDR approaches.</description>

However, the milling of titanium alloys often encounters engineering challenges such as severe tool wear and suboptimal surface integrity. This study aims to enhance the milling machinability of titanium alloys though the application of optimized supercritical CO2 (scCO2) cooling and minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) conditions. A finite element calculation model for milling titanium alloy under various cooling/lubrication conditions (CLCs) was developed. The instantaneous flow behaviors and heat transfer characteristics of the auxiliary medium were rigorously analyzed. Based on the milling experiments of titanium alloy, the effects of operating parameters and CLCs on the process parameters, surface integrity, and tool wear were systematically investigated. A coherent scheme for matching the energy field parameters with milling parameters to achieve the low-damage cutting of titanium alloys was developed. The results indicate that the implementation of scCO2-oil on water based on MQL (scCO2-OoWMQL) can productively address the issue of oil film rupture and insufficient wear reduction observed with the sole use of MQL or scCO2 cooling. Additionally, this composite technique significantly improved surface integrity of titanium alloy and ensures excellent preservation of the cutting-edge condition. The average resultant cutting force (Fr) and maximum cutting temperature (Tmax) increase with cutting speed (vc), feed per tooth (ft), and radial depth of cut (ae), whereas surface roughness (Sa) decreases with vc. Within the range of experimental parameters, the optimal combination of machining parameter was found to be vc=60 m/min, ft=0.09 mm/z, ae=0.3 mm, and ap=3 mm. When scCO2-OoWMQL is applied in conjunction with this combination, a significant reduction of 21.65% in Sa is achieved compared to dry cutting.

      <title>Alternatives for Decarbonising High-Temperature Heating Facilities in Residential Buildings</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en18020235</link>
      <description>Juan Carlos Roca Reina, Johan Carlsson, Jonathan Volt, Agne Toleikyte, Energies. 18(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406149559

                The European Union aims to become carbon-neutral by 2050 and to reduce CO2 emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The buildings sector accounts for about 40% of its total energy consumption and is responsible for 36% of the total CO2 emissions. For this reason, decarbonising the heat consumed in buildings is key to meeting these targets. CO2 emission reduction in buildings typically involves upgrading heating facilities to enable heat supply at lower temperatures, or renovating buildings, both of which can be challenging for end users. This paper analyses reducing emissions from residential buildings using high-temperature or hybrid heat pumps that can produce water at the same temperature as condensing boilers. This enables a significant reduction in emissions from buildings for owners who cannot afford or do not want to undertake a full renovation or upgrade of their current hydronic facility. The methodology followed makes use of a simplified hourly energy model based on ISO 52016-1:2017. The results indicate that, depending on the EU region, reducing CO2 emissions in buildings through these types of systems is feasible, leading to CO2 emission reductions of 40% to 70%.</description>

      <title>Cation Crossover Limits Accessible Current Densities for Zero-Gap Alkaline CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction to Ethylene</title>

                Traditional CO2 reduction systems often fail in an alkaline environment due to the interaction of CO2 with a high-pH electrolyte, where carbonate and bicarbonate ion formation results in potassium-containing salt precipitation. The presence of the salt crystals causes a reduction in the selectivity of the electrolyzer toward CO2 conversion. Here, the critical operational variables, which elicit the salting out process, are investigated (i.e., ion transport). When the electrolyzer exceeds a critical current density, H2 evolution dominates CO2 reduction due to salt formation, which is confirmed by postmortem cross-sectional SEM-EDS of the electrode. The critical current density decreases with an increasing membrane thickness or anolyte ionic strength. Cathode salt formation is mediated by the unmitigated crossover of cations from the anolyte to the cathode across an anion exchange membrane, through which cations are imperfectly excluded. It is likely that electric field-driven migration promotes an increase in concentration of potassium across the membrane, until, at the critical current density for that electrolyzer arrangement, the concentration of potassium and bicarbonate ions exceeds the solubility limit of KHCO3, leading to salt precipitation.</description>

      <title>Semipermanent Continuous Formic Acid Production from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by Controlling Ion Transport Using Boron-Doped Diamond Electrodes</title>

                Boron-doped diamond (BDD) is an excellent functional electrode material used as a working electrode in the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Formic acid production with approximately 100% Faradaic efficiency has been achieved via CO2 reduction using BDD electrodes. In this study, we investigated the production performance stability during long-term electrolysis by focusing on ion transport in the electrolyte during electrolysis. Initially, we investigated the behavior of potassium ions (K+) and pH during long-term electrolysis in detail. A relationship was observed between the change in ion concentrations and formic acid production, crucial in formic acid production. Based on this knowledge, we successfully achieved stable formic acid production for an extremely long time (1264 h) by controlling ion transport. In addition to utilizing the durability of BDD electrodes as stable electrode materials, controlling ion transport has paved the way for the industrialization of formic acid production via CO2 reduction.</description>

                The capture and utilization of CO2 from industrial off-gases to produce commodity chemicals has the potential to make an important contribution to the transition to a circular economy. Formate, and its conjugate formic acid, is a potential sustainable platform chemical that can be produced from CO2. Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate is a promising route, but biocatalysis with formate dehydrogenase (FDH) as biocatalyst may offer advantages for industrial implementation such as mild conditions, high product selectivity, and less expensive down-stream processing. Here, we investigated the potential of a metal-independent Thiobacillus FDH (TsFDH) as a biocatalyst for the production of formate from CO2-rich industrial offgases. An excellent stability was demonstrated, also in the presence of potential off-gas impurities. A formate titer of 14 mM could be achieved at pH 6.5 and 37 &#176;C, with an initial specific productivity of 0.37 mmol g&#8722;1FDH h&#8722;1. TsFDH compares favorably to metal-dependent FDHs with respect to stability, O2-sensitivity and activity at low pH values, but unfavorably in terms of CO2 reduction activity, hampering its potential as industrial biocatalyst. Specific rates could be significantly improved by further reaction engineering, and possibly also by enzyme engineering.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy multi-objective optimization model to design a sustainable closed-loop manufacturing system</title>

                Republicans and Democrats practically everywhere have been demonstrating concerns about environmental conservation to achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) since the turn of the century. To promote fuel (energy) savings and a reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide CO 2 emissions in several enterprises, actions have been taken based on the concepts described. This study proposes an environmentally friendly manufacturing system designed to minimize environmental impacts. Specifically, it aims to develop a sustainable manufacturing process that accounts for energy consumption and CO 2 emissions from direct and indirect energy sources. A multi-objective mathematical model has been formulated, incorporating financial and environmental constraints, to minimize overall costs, energy consumption, and CO 2 emissions within the manufacturing framework. The input model parameters for real-world situations are generally unpredictable, so a fuzzy multi-objective model will be developed as a way to handle it. The validity of the proposed ecological industrial design will be tested using a scenario-based approach. Results demonstrate the high reliability, applicability, and effectiveness of the proposed network when analyzed using the developed techniques.</description>

      <title>Thermal Methanol Synthesis from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Using Cu/ZnO Catalysts: Insights from First&#8208;Principles Calculations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/sstr.202400345</link>

                Catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide to methanol offers a promising avenue for recycling CO 2 , enhancing environmental sustainability. Cu/ZnO has long been identified as one of the most effective heterogeneous catalysts for this reaction, yet the detailed understanding of its reaction mechanism and active sites remains incomplete. Recent advances have highlighted the critical role of defects, such as ZnCu steps and stacking faults on Cu surfaces, in enhancing catalyst performance. Here this concept is explored through first&#8208;principles surface simulations of six models, featuring diverse Cu&#8211;Zn combinations and specific coordination environments under realistic conditions. It is revealed that Cu/ZnO catalysts with kink defects, rather than surface ZnCu alloys, exhibit optimal activity for methanol synthesis. Specifically, the findings demonstrate how intermediate configurations and rate&#8208;determining steps vary with changes in surface structure and reveal the role of the kink in promoting CO 2 reduction to methanol through electronic structure calculation. Moreover, it is found that the predominant synthetic pathway for CH 3 OH from CO 2 involves the reverse water gas shift and CO hydrogenation, rather than the formate route, on Cu/ZnO surfaces with kinks.</description>

      <title>Health system and environmental factors affecting global progress towards achieving End TB targets between 2015 and 2020</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.15.04004</link>
      <description>Haileab Fekadu Wolde, Archie C. A. Clements, Kefyalew Addis Alene, Journal of Global Health. 15(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406245452

                Health system and environmental factors play a significant role in achieving the World Health Organization (WHO) End Tuberculosis (TB) targets. However, quantitative measures are scarce or non-existent at a global level. We aimed to measure the progress made towards meeting the global End TB milestones from 2015 to 2020 and identify health system and environmental factors contributing to the success. We obtained data from ten different online data repositories and used principal component analysis to create domain-specific health system performance measures. We used radar charts and dumbbell plots to show the country's progress in ending TB with their health systems. Lastly, we used a linear regression model to identify key health systems and environmental predictors of the percent reduction in TB incidence and mortality. There was a high variation in TB incidence and mortality reduction between countries and WHO regions. Of all countries included, 75 (39.3%) achieved more than a 20% reduction in TB incidence between 2015 and 2020. However, only 31 (16.2%) reached a 35% reduction in TB mortality. The European Region achieved the highest incidence reduction, exceeding the 2020 milestone with a 25% reduction. The African Region also made notable progress, achieving an 18% mortality reduction despite its relatively poor health systems. Health system factors, such as TB financing, TB-specific health service delivery, access to medicine, and governance, were significantly associated with TB mortality reduction between 2015 and 2020. Environmental factors, such as average annual temperature and air particulate matter concentration, were found to have a significant negative effect on TB incidence and mortality reduction. Weak health systems were identified as major barriers to achieving the End TB milestones in most high-burden countries. Hence, strengthening health systems with a special focus on TB financing, service delivery, and access to medicine in these countries should be prioritised to achieve global TB mortality reduction targets. Countries should follow WHO's air quality guidelines and rapidly reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the impact of environmental factors.</description>

      <title>From Waste to Resource: Evaluation of the Technical and Environmental Performance of Concrete Blocks Made from Iron Ore Tailings</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su17020552</link>

                This study investigates the use of iron ore tailings (IOTs) as recycled aggregates in segmental blocks, focusing on technical performance, CO2 emissions, and embodied energy using the cradle-to-gate approach. IOTs replaced fine aggregates in concrete at 25%, 50%, and 75% by volume, achieving compressive strengths of 16.23 MPa, 10.02 MPa, and 3.93 MPa, respectively. Raw material production accounted for 98% of CO2 emissions and 86% of embodied energy. Producing blocks at mining sites offered limited environmental benefits due to longer transport distances. Despite this, the results showed a 6% reduction in CO2 emissions and a 35% improvement in mechanical&#8211;environmental performance (CO2 emissions weighted by compressive strength) compared to traditional concrete. These findings underscore the potential of IOT-based concrete for segmental block production.</description>

      <title>Editorial: Abiotic stresses in field crops: response, impacts and management under climate change scenario</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fsufs.2024.1539301</link>
      <description>Aliza Pradhan, Ashim Datta, Milan Kumar Lal, Mahesh Kumar, Md. Khairul Alam, P. S. Basavaraj, Kamal Krishna Pal, Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems. 8(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406132335

                Agriculture faces significant challenges from environmental factors like drought, heat, waterlogging, cold, soil salinity, nutrient deficiency, and heavy metal contamination (Pathak, 2023). These stresses impair plant function, limiting growth and productivity. With climate change increasing the frequency and intensity of these stresses, food and nutrition security are at risk. Plants employ various tolerance mechanisms at molecular, biochemical, physiological, and morpho-anatomical levels, which vary by species and stress type (Rane et al., 2021). This editorial highlights promising research showcasing advanced understanding of plant responses to abiotic stresses. Through 14 publications (13 original research and 1 review) editorial covers various aspects of managing the emerging and future abiotic stresses through innovative G &#215; E &#215; M (genotype by environment by management) practices for improving the tolerance as well as adaptation and mitigation strategies for enhanced sustainability of crop production systems.Oat (Avena nuda L.) is a moderately salt-tolerant cereal crop, and understanding its salinity tolerance mechanisms can improve production in salt-affected areas. Liu et al. studied the salt tolerance of the naked oat line Bayou1, treating 17-day-old seedlings with varying NaCl concentrations for 12 days. Optimal growth was observed at 50 mM NaCl. Despite reduced water uptake and nutrient imbalances, Bayou1 maintained root growth, indicating roots play a key role in its salt tolerance through increased Na + concentrations in root cell sap while maintaining membrane integrity and osmotic potential.Azrai et al. applied machine learning (ML) to predict maize grain yield and stress tolerance index (STI) under normal and drought conditions. Thirty-five genotypes were evaluated across three sites, and ML models were optimized using genetic algorithms (GA) and ensemble methods. Results showed that ensemble models optimized by grid search had the best performance, with R 2 values of 0.92 for grain yield and 0.82 for STI. The Multi-trait Genotype-Ideotype Distance (MGIDI) approach accurately identified superior hybrids (H06, H10, H13, H35), highlighting the potential of ML and MGIDI in drought-tolerant maize breeding.Excess soil iron (Fe) toxicity is a major challenge for rice cultivation in acidic soils. Sonu et al. assessed sixteen rice genotypes under varying iron (Fe) levels to evaluate their responses to Fe toxicity, focusing on seedling root systems. Hydroponic screening identified 460 ppm Fe as a critical threshold, significantly affecting root traits and biomass. Genotypes were classified into tolerant and sensitive categories using leaf bronzing scores and a response stability index. Tolerant varieties, such as ILS 12-5, were identified, while popular varieties like BPT 5204 and Pusa 44 showed high sensitivity to Fe toxicity.Traditional rice monocropping in uplands is not environmentally sustainable and profitable. Pan et al. assessed the energy flow, carbon balance, and GWP of five monocropping systems (rice, finger millet, black gram, horse gram, pigeon pea) and four intercropping systems (rice+black gram, rice+horse gram, finger millet+black gram, finger millet+horse gram). Rice+black gram and rice+horse gram were the most energy-efficient, with better carbon efficiency and sustainability. Pigeon pea and finger millet+horse gram offered higher rice equivalent yields and benefit-cost ratios. Overall, pigeon pea and finger millet-based intercropping systems were the best options for eastern India's rainfed upland agro-ecosystem.High carbon losses in Mollisols pose a substantial challenge to food security and climate regulation. Liang et al. assessed fertilization strategies on crop yield, soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, and carbon sequestration efficiency under climate change scenarios in Northeast China using the SPACSYS model. Higher temperatures reduced maize yield by 14.5% in Harbin and 13.3% in Gongzhuling, and soybean yield by 10.6%. SOC sequestration efficiency decreased with increased carbon input. Manure application resulted in higher carbon sequestration efficiency compared to other treatments, making it an effective practice for climate change mitigation in Mollisols.screened cowpea varieties for waterlogging tolerance by evaluating morphophysiological and root traits under 10 days of waterlogging stress at the seedling stage. Waterlogging reduced plant height, leaf area, chlorophyll content, and NDVI, but tolerant varieties like DC15 and PL4 exhibited increased adventitious root (AR) number and length. Correlation and PCA analyses revealed a positive link between AR formation/length and waterlogging tolerance, suggesting these traits as valuable markers for breeding waterloggingtolerant cowpeas.Smallholder maize farming in sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to drought, threatening food security and livelihoods. Ndlovu et al. mapped genomic regions associated with water stress tolerance in tropical maize using three F3 populations (753 families) evaluated in Kenya and Zimbabwe. High-density SNP markers identified 93 QTLs under well-watered and 41 under water-stressed conditions, with significant QTLs for grain yield, plant height, ear height, and anthesis-silking interval. These findings highlight the potential of genomic selection for improving maize breeding to enhance drought tolerance and support food security in sub-Saharan Africa.Drought is a major concern in chickpea breeding, controlled by multiple genes. Harish et al. examined 125 chickpea landraces from the West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region, and 4 varieties, to identify marker-trait associations (MTAs) and candidate genes for drought tolerance. Thirteen physio-morphological traits were analyzed over two years at two locations, revealing strong correlations between seed yield and biological yield. Using genotypic data from 6,367 SNPs, 52 significant SNPs were identified, including genes related to drought tolerance such as GHR1, WAT1, and beta-galactosidase, which will aid in improving drought tolerance in chickpea breeding.Cadmium (Cd) contamination in agricultural soils is a global concern due to its harmful effects on human health. Iqbal et al. investigated the impact of vermicompost (VC) on soil properties, plant physiology, leaf ultrastructure, antioxidant defense, and rice yields under Cd stress. Results showed that Cd toxicity decreased soil quality, photosynthesis, and antioxidant activity, leading to lower rice yields. However, VC application improved soil health, enhanced physiological functions, and boosted antioxidant enzyme activities, reducing Cd uptake and alleviating oxidative damage. The treatment (50 mg Cd + 6 t ha -1 VC) significantly increased grain yields, highlighting potential of vermicompost towards sustainable rice production in Cd-contaminated soils.Climate change directly affects cotton yield by damaging morphological development and plant growth. Fan et al. used the AquaCrop model and 30 years of meteorological data to optimize irrigation and planting dates for cotton under limited water conditions. Results showed that higher irrigation quotas increased yield and biomass, with 495 mm achieving optimal water efficiency. Planting in late March to early April suits regions with abundant water, while late April to early May is better for water-scarce areas, using early-maturing varieties.Continuous drought stress threatens food security, yet crop responses remain uncertain. Cui et al. calibrated and validated the AquaCrop model using summer maize data from 2017-2018 to simulate growth under various drought scenarios. The model analyzed transpiration (Tr), biomass accumulation, and yield formation at two growth stages. Results showed that drought at the seedling stage significantly reduced transpiration and biomass, with severe drought during the seedling and jointing stages causing total yield loss. The study emphasized the importance of avoiding severe drought at these stages for sustainable maize yield.Chakrabarti et al. investigated the effects of elevated ozone (O3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) on rice productivity in northern India over two kharif seasons (2020)(2021). Using Free Air Ozone-Carbon dioxide Enrichment (FAOCE) rings, three rice varieties (Pusa Basmati 1121, Nagina 22, IR64 Drt1) were examined under varying nitrogen (N) management. Elevated O3 reduced photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration, resulting a 6.9-9% yield reduction. Elevated CO2 partially compensated for yield losses, particularly in Nagina 22. Additional N (125% RDN) improved grain N uptake under elevated O3 and CO2 conditions.Siddiqui investigated the effects of cypermethrin, a widely used synthetic pyrethroid, on growth, pollen morphology, fertility, and antioxidant activities in Cicer arietinum L. The exposure not only reduced plant height, branches, pods, seeds, and yield but also increased pollen wrinkling, reduced fertility, impacted chlorophyll and carotenoid content. Cypermethrin also affected hydrogen peroxide scavenging, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzyme activities in a dosedependent manner. These findings highlight the need for further research on the ecological and health risks of cypermethrin exposure.Rui et al. conducted a review on drought and heat stress in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) from 1994 to 2024 showcasing consistent publications from China and the USA. Keyword analysis revealed "growth," "endophytic fungi," and "yield" in drought studies, while "growth," "gene," and "leaf" were common in heat stress research. Most studies focused on phenotype, resistance mechanisms, and endophytes. The review emphasized the need for further molecular research on drought-heat stress interactions.Overall, this comprehensive range of research highlights the need for a multifaceted approach to understand the interactions and impacts of combined stresses, crucial for developing stresstolerant crops and devising mitigation strategies for various climatic challenges.</description>

      <title>Increasing photosynthetic benefit with decreasing irrigation frequency in an Australian temperate pasture exposed to elevated carbon dioxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erae511</link>
      <description>Melika L Missen, Martin G. De Kauwe, Mark J. Hovenden, Journal of Experimental Botany. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406149492

                Abstract Elevated atmospheric CO2 (e[CO2]) often enhances plant photosynthesis and improves water status. However, the effects of e[CO2] vary significantly and are believed to be influenced by water availability. With the future warmer climate expected to increase the frequency and severity of extreme rainfall, the response of plants to e[CO2] under changing precipitation patterns remains uncertain. We examined the effects of e[CO2] and different irrigation regimes on perennial ryegrass in a Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment. Immediately after irrigation, the mean net photosynthetic rate was 21.2% higher under e[CO2] compared to ambient conditions. This benefit increased over time, reaching 31.3% higher as days since watering increased, indicating a substantial increase in photosynthetic benefit with longer intervals between watering. Mean stomatal conductance was 21% lower in ryegrass under e[CO2] immediately after irrigation compared to ambient plots. However, the reduction in stomatal conductance under e[CO2] decreased as the interval between irrigation events increased, showing no difference 7-10 days after an irrigation event. These results imply that plants benefit most from carbon fertilisation, assimilating relatively more carbon and losing less water, during periods with less frequent rainfall. These findings have significant implications for understanding leaf-level responses to climate change.</description>

      <title>Improved Uniformity Properties and Corrosion Resistance of Zinc&#8211;Nickel Composite Coating Enhanced by Nano-SiO2</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/coatings15010071</link>
      <description>Sujie Chang, Yuanhao Wang, Jianpeng Wang, Zerui Hao, Yang Yang, Y.Y. Wang, Xinyi Wang, Fan Cao, Lei Shi, Coatings. 15(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406242903

                In this study, pre-treated low-carbon steel substrates were electroplated with Zinc&#8211;Nickel (ZN) alloy composite coatings enhanced by the incorporation of nano-silicon dioxide (SiO2) particles in an alkaline solution. ZN deposits with varying concentrations of nano-SiO2&#8212;specifically, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 wt%&#8212;were achieved by adjusting the ratio between the nano-SiO2 and ZN alloy electroplating solutions. The influence of the nano-SiO2 content on both the quality of the coating and its corrosion behavior was investigated in detail. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and an atomic force microscope (AFM) were utilized to assess the surface, cross-section structure, elemental composition, and thickness of the coatings. Notably, the addition of nano-SiO2 improved the microstructure of the coating, leading to a reduction in grain size as well as enhancements in uniformity and density while revealing that co-deposition reached an optimal concentration at 3 wt% nano-SiO2. The corrosion behavior of coated specimens was evaluated through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and polarization techniques within a 3.5 wt% NaCl solution serving as a corrosive medium. Specifically, for typical prepared coatings, the corrosion current density decreased from 1.410 &#215; 10&#8722;4 A&#183;cm&#8722;2 to 5.762 &#215; 10&#8722;6 A&#183;cm&#8722;2, which is a remarkable reduction by one to two orders of magnitude relative to the SiO2-free coatings mentioned previously. These findings provide a straightforward approach for selecting 3 wt% nano-SiO2 as an effective additive in ZN composite coatings.</description>

      <title>Heat-Fluid-Solid-Coupled Model for Flue Gas Displacement of CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in Coal Seams and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.4c10428</link>
      <description>Gang Bai, Xuepeng Wang, Jue Wang, Xueming Li, Tianyu Xin, Z. H. Liu, Jie Wei, Chaojun Fan, Zehao Jing, ACS Omega. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406218229

                The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of injecting flue gas (CO2, N2, and O2) originating from coal-fired power plants into a coal seam on CH4 extraction and CO2 geological storage. To this end, a multifield thermal-fluid-solid-coupled mathematical model of flue gas injection extraction was established. The results showed that with the increase in time increase, the volume concentration of CH4 decreased, but the CO2, N2, and O2 increased. Compared with single extraction, the gas injection extraction brought about a significant reduction in the pressure and content of CH4, an increase in the CH4 extraction rate, and an increase in the effective radius of CH4 extraction. In the single extraction, the temperature of the reservoir decreased, and its permeability increased. In the gas injection extraction, the temperature near the gas injection hole increased, whereas the temperature near the extraction hole decreased, and the permeability decreased overall. A method of measuring the effective radius of gas extraction by temperature is presented. The storage and extraction times of CO2 exhibited a linear relationship, and the CO2 escape rate increased gradually. The longer the gas injection extraction time, the greater the risk of coal and gas (CO2) outbursts.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Metal&#8211;Sorbent Interactions Determine CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Capture and Conversion in Dual-Function Materials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c13606</link>
      <description>Shradha Sapru, Kelle D. Hart, Chengshuang Zhou, Gennaro Liccardo, Jinwon Oh, Margaret J. Hollobaugh, Jorge Osio&#8208;Norgaard, Arun Majumdar, Bert D. Chandler, Matteo Cargnello, ACS Nano. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406169008

                Carbon capture and utilization involve multiple energy- and cost-intensive steps. Dual-function materials (DFMs) can reduce these demands by coupling CO2 adsorption and conversion into a single material with two functionalities: a sorbent phase and a metal for catalytic CO2 conversion. The role of metal catalysts in the conversion process seems salient from previous work, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive and deserve deeper investigation to achieve maximum utilization of the two phases. Here, preformed colloidal Ru nanoparticles were deposited onto a "NaOx"/Al2O3 sorbent to prepare prototypical DFMs with controlled phases for CO2 capture and hydrogenation to CH4. Ru addition was found to double the high-temperature CO2 adsorption capacity by activating the "NaOx"/Al2O3 sorbent phase during a reductive pretreatment step. Most importantly, low Ru loadings were sufficient to ensure maximum CO2 adsorption and conversion. This was attributed to the key role of the metal&#8211;sorbent interactions, wherein Ru was required to hydrogenate strongly bound CO2 on the "NaOx"/Al2O3 sorbent to CH4 via the H2 activated on Ru. This interaction facilitated rate-determining carbonate migration and subsequent hydrogenation at the metal&#8211;sorbent interface. Overall, Ru controlled the CO2 hydrogenation reaction rate, while the "NaOx"/Al2O3 sorbent dictated the CO2 uptake capacity. By controlling metal&#8211;sorbent interactions at the molecular level, we demonstrate the critical role of the two phases and their synergy, facilitating the design of DFMs with maximum CO2 capture and conversion efficiency.</description>

      <title>Anthropogenic Methane Emission In India: Sources Of Methane Reduction Through Circular Economy For Mitigating Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5087878</link>
      <description>R. Subramanian, Balaji Chandramohan, S. Sunitha, SSRN Electronic Journal. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406234287

                Methane, one of the major greenhouse gases (GHGs) produced due to various anthropogenic activities, is on the rise with increasing population and urbanization. It is the second most important greenhouse gas which is 28 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere and contributes to the formation of ground-level ozone. It is the second largest contributor of climate change, accounting for about 16% of the warming effect. India is one of the major methaneemitting countries where methane emission is from human activities such as agriculture, livestock centric fermentation, and urban waste dumping in areas like urban wetlands. Though methane is a byproduct in the industrial process and despite new technologies being available for methane recovery, methane emission continues to grow without the use of circular economy owing to inadequate investment on the one hand and the growing population and urbanization on the other hand. Atmospheric burden due to methane emission can be reduced substantially with the practice of waste reduction, waste recycling and conversion of biowaste into energy. The paper suggests technological use, innovations and development needs to be relevant for both business success and environmental sustainability. The present paper takes a modest attempt to describe the production of methane based on different anthropogenic activities, its contribution to the GHGs and the possibilities of reducing methane through the practice of following circular economy.</description>

      <title>Comparative Techno-Economic Analysis of Negative Emission Co2 Power Plant vs Ccgt with Ccs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5087251</link>

                A techno-economic analysis is performed on the negative CO2 emission gas power plant (nCO2PP) vs combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) with carbon capture and storage (CCS). In nCO2PP it can be distinguished following three islands: the fuel preparation, power generation and CO2 separation and capture, respectively. The nCO2PP and CCGT with CCS are modeled in commercial software. The CCGT power plant with amine capture has been used as reference to represent state-of-the-art power generation technology. Both CAPEX and OPEX as well as incomes from sewage sludge disposal and avoided CO2 emissions have been included in the techno-economic analyses. The boundary of the cost analyses includes the power plants, CO2 capture processes and conditioning. The results show that the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of the nCO2PP using exhaust gas gasifier is comparable to the reference CCGT with amine capture. Due to the high electrical energy consumption and equipment cost, the LCOE is much higher when the plasma gasifier is used. The LCOE strongly depends on the income from sewage sludge disposal and avoided CO2 emissions. Further reductions of LCOE are expected for the nCO2PP with the development of the technology maturity.</description>

      <title>Decorating pore environment via cationic units of covalent organic frameworks for enhancing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20517/cs.2024.34</link>
      <description>Minghao Liu, Guojuan Liu, Qing Xu, Gaofeng Zeng, Chemical Synthesis. 5(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406188869

                The conversion performance for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) relies on the affinity of CO2 molecules. Ionic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising platforms for CO2RR due to the accessible catalytic sites in the skeleton, high CO2 combination ability and the electronic conductivity. However, most ionic COFs are constructed via pre-functionalization of the monomers or post-modification of the skeleton, encountering incomplete loading or uneven distribution of the active sites. In this work, a cationic porphyrin-based COF using the (3-carboxypropyl)trimethylammonium and Co-porphyrin units is developed through the sub-stoichiometric bottom-up synthesis method to fine-tune the pore environment for modulating the binding ability of CO2. Compared to base COFs, the cationic COFs exhibit improved electronic conductivity, high CO2 adsorption uptakes and enhanced reducibility, further improving the electrocatalytic CO2RR performance. Notably, the cationic COF achieves a high CO selectivity of 93% and a partial current density of 24.6 mA&#183;cm-2. This work not only offers considerable insights for improving the catalytic performance of COFs through the cationic groups but also provides a stoichiometry method to modulate the pore environment.</description>

      <title>Photo-Catalytic Reduction of Nitrate by Ag-TiO2/Formic Acid Under Visible Light: Selectivity of Nitrogen and Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/w17020155</link>

                Ubiquitous nitrate (NO3&#8722;) in groundwater sources is considered a hazard compound for human health. Photo-catalytic reduction by Ag-TiO2/formic acid/visible light represents an emerging method for NO3&#8722; removal without secondary pollution. In this contribution, the removal of NO3&#8722; by photo-catalytic reduction and the selectivity of N2 were systematically investigated under varied conditions, including concentrations of Ag-TiO2, NO3&#8722;, and formic acid (HCOOH). The removal efficiency of NO3&#8722; reached 84.47%, 82.68% of which was converted to N2 under the optimal conditions: NO3&#8722; at 50 mg-N/L, Ag-TiO2 at 1.0 g/L, HCOOH at 20.05 mmol/L, and reaction time at 120 min. The removal of NO3&#8722; was enhanced mainly by CO2&#8722; rather than by photo-generated electrons or HCOO&#8722;. The results of this study indicated that the production of &#183;CO2&#8722; by Ag-TiO2 and HCOOH under visible light catalysis can achieve efficient NO3&#8722; removal.</description>

                The purpose of this research article is to perform a greenhouse gas (GHG) impact assessment using a lifecycle analysis of a cold-ironing solution for vessels at anchorage in a retrofitted barge and a marine genset combusting biomethane in dual fuel mode. A lifecycle methodology is developed based on the 4th International Maritime Organization (IMO) GHG study. Eleven impact scenarios are evaluated in terms of CO2 and harmful pollutants (SOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5, NMVOC, and NOx). Vessels operated by Petronav Ship Management Ltd are examined, specifically M/T Alexandria and M/T Astraia. The scenarios reveal CO2 reductions of up to 21% and CO increases of up to 60% due to the combustion of biomethane in dual fuel mode, alongside SOx reductions of up to 20% with increasing biomethane energy substitution. Particulates and NOx decrease due to the utilization of biomethane. This article presents a pragmatic solution for cold ironing for vessels at anchorage with proven lower GHG emissions with the exception of increased CO emissions, therefore the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.</description>

                Rural electrification is key to socio-economic development in developing countries like Nigeria. However, extending the national grid to remote rural areas is expensive and time consuming, and the traditional power supply method also involves utilization of a standalone renewable energy source such as Solar which have their associated drawbacks due to their unreliability in nature. Hence, this research carried out a techno-economic and environmental analysis of an off-grid hybrid renewable energy system for rural electrification using Kepler Optimization Algorithm (KOA). Feasibility study on electricity and hourly load demand assessment of Alayin village was conducted and village load profile was estimated. Mathematical modeling of each hybrid RES was formulated. A KOA technique was employed to carry out optimal sizing and check the cost efficiency of BG/ PHES/ Battery, PV/PHES/Battery, and the hybrid RES (PV/BG/PHES/Battery). Simulation of the model was done using MATLAB R2021a. The value obtained was validated with Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) for performance evaluation using Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), Loss of Power Supply Probability (LPSP) and CO2 reduction in manure management as performance metrics. The results of the analysis showed an appreciable reduction on the LCOE and CO2 with high reliability using KOA-hybrid RES compared with GSA-hybrid RES.</description>

                Atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) have emerged as an intriguing class of model catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). However, the interplay between the interface environment (e.g., potential, cation concentration) and electron&#8211;proton transfer (ET/PT) kinetics&#9472;particularly in alkynyl-protected metal NCs&#9472;remains poorly understood. Here, we combined first-principles simulations and electrochemical experiments to investigate the role of potential and cation effect on CO2RR performance in a prototype all-alkynyl-protected Ag15(C&#8801;C&#8211;CH3)+ cluster. Our simulations revealed that the applied reduction potential triggers the elimination of the alkynyl ligand via sequentially breaking two &#960;-type Ag&#8211;C bonds and one &#963;-type Ag&#8211;C bond to expose the catalytically active Ag sites, and the barrier of the Ag&#8211;C breakage monotonically decreases with the lowering in potential. Furthermore, we show that introducing the inner-sphere Na+ ions greatly enhances *CO2 activation and promotes proton transfer to generate *COOH and *CO by forming the Na+&#8211;CO2(*COOH) complexes, while the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) from water dissociation is greatly suppressed, thus dramatically improving the selectivity of CO2 electroreduction. The electrochemical measurements further validated our predictions, where the CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) and current density (jCO) show a pronounced dependence on the Na+ concentration. At an optimal concentration of 0.1 M NaCl, FECO can reach up to &#8764;96%, demonstrating the crucial role of cations in promoting the CO2RR. Our findings provide vital insights into the atomic-level reaction mechanism of the CO2RR on alkynyl-protected Ag15 NCs and highlight the important role of potential and electrolyte cation in governing the electron/proton transfer kinetics.</description>

      <title>Systematic Review (2019 to 2024) Suggests Significant Variation in, and Poor Reporting of, Anesthesia Practices in Model Insects</title>

                Evidence is growing that insects may feel pain, suggesting that the precautionary use of pain reduction methods like anesthesia may be an important refinement for these species in laboratory research. Given that anesthetic use is not mandated for insects in research, this review aimed to determine if and how modern researchers working with ten model insect species use anesthetic agents. We searched Google Scholar for all papers published on each model species that contained a mention of anesthesia from 2019-2024; then, we confirmed whether anesthesia was used for putative pain reduction/loss of consciousness purposes in a laboratory setting (n = 93). Papers that met these criteria were found for five species: the western honey bee (n = 8), the migratory locust (n = 4), the house cricket (n = 3), the black soldier fly (n = 3), and the fruit fly (n = 75). Cold or freezing was reported for all five species; isoflurane, sevoflurane, carbon dioxide, desflurane, halothane, flyNap (triethylamine), dyclonine, etomidate, ketamine, 2,6-diisopropyl phenol, propofol, tricaine mesylate, chloroform, xenon, eugenol, alcohol, ether, and nitrogen gas were reported for a subset of species (with the vast majority of variance in anesthetic choice resulting from the fruit fly literature). The majority of studies did not report exposure procedure, anesthetic dose or exposure time; when reported, these details varied widely, suggesting a lack of standardization in anesthesia protocols among insect researchers that may harm reproducibility. Further, 24.4% of studies reported the use of an anesthetic (cold) not recommended by invertebrate veterinarians, suggesting a lack of integration between the insect research and veterinary communities on refining experimental procedures. Overall, our review suggests there is a need to develop standardized, species-specific anesthesia protocols that improve scientific reproducibility and support welfare in model insects.</description>

      <title>Effect of Slag Content and Carbonation/Ageing on Freeze-Thaw Resistance of Concrete</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2478/ncr-2024-0012</link>
      <description>Muhammad Ahsan Iqbal, Teemu Ojala, Fahim Al-Neshawy, Jouni Punkki, Nordic Concrete Research/Nordic concrete research. 71(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406215153

                Abstract The construction industry is pursuing the reduction of CO2 emissions and the development of lowcarbon concrete. LOIKKA research project was initiated in Finland with the aim to reduce the CO2 emissions of concrete manufacturing by 50%. The use of blast furnace slag was seen as the most competitive way to significantly reduce CO2 emissions of concrete. However, incorporating slag in concrete can lead to durability complications, particularly concerning salt freeze-thaw resistance. This study investigates the effects of slag content, carbonation/ageing, and pre-curing conditions on the freeze-thaw and salt freeze-thaw resistance of concrete. Additionally, it evaluates the compressive strength development and porosity differences of test concretes. Slab tests were conducted to determine the surface scaling and internal damage resistance of concrete specimens. The results showed that high slag content and carbonation reduced salt freeze-thaw resistance. The incorporation of 50% slag content as the cement clinker replacement is considered critical. An increase in slag content led to a decrease in the compressive strength at 7 days due to the low reactivity of slag but achieved the highest compressive strength at 91 days with 70% slag content. These insights contribute to our understanding of the durability properties of concrete incorporating slag.</description>

                In this work, we have reduced CO2 with HBpin to afford borylated methanol product selectively in ~99% yield using Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as a catalyst. This led to multigram scale isolation of methanol obtained from CO2 reduction via the hydrolysis of borylated methanol, this establishes the potential of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 as an efficient homogeneous catalyst for the bulk scale methanol synthesis. A practical application of this catalytic system was also shown by reducing CO2&#8208;containing motorbike exhaust efficiently and selectively. Further, C&#8210;O bond activation of esters and epoxides using HBpin and 1&#8208;2 mol% of Ce[N(SiMe3)2]3(THF)3 at 60 &#176;C afforded the borylated alcohols in good to excellent yields, which can easily be hydrolysed to the eco&#8208;friendly corresponding alcohol. The stoichiometric experiments were performed to prove the formation of in&#8208;situ generated cerium hydride [Ce]&#8208;H as an active catalyst.</description>

      <title>Operation Window and Carbon Emission of the Blast Furnace with Natural Gas and Pulverized Coal Co-injection</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2355/isijinternational.isijint-2024-297</link>

                The injection of pulverized coal into blast furnaces has alleviated the demand for metallurgical coke, and co-injection technology combining natural gas and pulverized coal with high oxygen enrichment has the potential to further reduce coke use and hence CO2 emissions. This work presents a steady-state operational model for the co-injection of natural gas and pulverized coal into blast furnaces developed based on mass and energy balance. With the support of industrial data from the commercial blast furnace, the matching relationship between natural gas rate, pulverized coal injection rate, and oxygen enrichment is quantitatively examined under the constraints of raceway adiabatic flame temperature and top gas temperature. The effect of natural gas rate on coke rate and CO2 emission reduction is investigated. The results show that increasing natural gas injection rate, lower pulverized coal rate and higher oxygen enrichment maintains a constant raceway adiabatic flame temperature and coke rate. Under the optimal operating conditions, the pulverized coal, coke rate, and CO2 emissions are reduced by 30.2%, 7.3% and 6.2%, respectively. The model and its results are expected to be helpful for a better understanding co-injection of natural gas and pulverized coal into blast furnaces, as well as contribute to reducing coke rate, pulverized coal rate, and CO2 emissions.</description>

      <title>Carbon Footprint Analysis of an Outpatient Dermatology Practice at an Academic Medical Center</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1001/jamadermatol.2024.5669</link>

                Importance There is growing awareness of the US health sector&#8217;s substantial contribution to the country&#8217;s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, exacerbating the health threats from climate change. Reducing health care&#8217;s environmental impact requires understanding its carbon emissions, but there are few published audits of health systems and fewer comprehensive emissions analyses at the clinic or department level. Objective To quantify the annual GHG emissions from a large outpatient dermatology practice, compare relative sources of emissions, and identify actionable targets. Design and Setting This quality improvement study involving a comprehensive carbon footprint analysis (scopes 1-3) of a large (nearly 30 000 visits/y), outpatient medical dermatology practice within the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s academic medical complex was conducted following the GHG Protocol Corporate and Corporate Value Chain reporting standards for fiscal year 2022 (ie, July 2021 through June 2022). Data were obtained through energy metering, manual audits, electronic medical records, and administrative data. Exposure Data were converted into metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2 e), allowing comparison of global-warming potential of emitted GHGs. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes were tCO 2 e by scope 1 (direct emissions), scope 2 (indirect, purchased energy), and scope 3 (indirect, upstream/downstream sources), as well as by individual categories of emission sources within each scope. Results Scope 3 contributed most to the clinic&#8217;s carbon footprint, composing 165.5 tCO 2 e (51.1%), followed by scope 2 (149.9 tCO 2 e [46.3%]), and scope 1 (8.2 tCO 2 e [2.5%]). Within scope 3, the greatest contributor was overall purchased goods and services (120.3 tCO 2 e [72.7% of scope 3]), followed by patient travel to and from the clinic (14.2 tCO 2 e [8.6%]) and waste (13.1 tCO 2 e [7.9%]). Steam and chilled water were the largest contributors to scope 2. Clinic energy use intensity was 185.4 kBtu/sqft. Conclusions and Relevance In this quality improvement study, the composition of emissions at the clinic level reflects the importance of scope 3, paralleling the health sector overall. The lower-resource intensity of the clinic compared to the average energy requirements of the total clinical complex led to a relatively large contribution from scope 2. These findings support efforts to characterize high-yield emissions-reduction targets and allow for identification of actionable, clinic-level steps that may inform broader health system efforts.</description>

                Renewable electricity&#8208;driven electrochemical reduction of CO2 offers a promising route for production of high&#8208;value ethanol. However, the current state of this technology is hindered by low selectivity and productivity, primarily due to limited understanding of the atomic&#8208;level active sites involved in ethanol formation. Herein, we identify that the interfacial oxygen vacancy&#8208;neighboring Cu (Ov&#8208;Cu) pair sites are the active sites for CO2 electroreduction to ethanol. A linear correlation between the density of Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites and ethanol productivity is experimentally evidenced. Moreover, a high Faradaic efficiency of 48.5% and a partial current density of 344.0 mA cm&#8208;2 for ethanol production are achieved over the inverse CeO2/Cu catalyst with a high density of Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites in acid. Mechanistic studies that combine density functional theory calculations and spectroscopic techniques propose an Ov&#8208;involved mechanism where interfacial Ov sites directly activate and dissociate CO2 into *CO in a thermodynamically spontaneous manner, thus favoring the subsequent *CHO formation and asymmetric CHO&#8208;CO coupling. Besides, the asymmetric Ov&#8208;Cu pair sites could preferentially stabilize the *CH2CHOH intermediate, resulting in the favorable formation of ethanol over ethylene. Our findings provide new atomic&#8208;level insights into CO2 electroreduction to ethanol, paving the way for the rational design of future catalysts.</description>

                Electrocatalytic CO2 conversion is a promising method for reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and lowering CO2 emissions. However, challenges such as suppression of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and long-term stability, especially in acidic media, among others, hinder its industrial application. Herein, Fe and Sn single sites supported on an N-doped carbon support (FSNC) was prepared by direct pyrolysis of selected precursors. XANES and EXAFS measurements confirmed the presence of Fe and Sn single atoms coordinated to N or O atoms in the N-doped carbon. An analogous material synthesized by deposition of Fe and Sn precursors on a previously fabricated N-doped carbon matrix (FS/NC), followed by thermal reduction, rendered Fe&#8211;O small clusters and Sn single atoms. FSNC was tested for CO2 reduction, obtaining a CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92%, while the CO FE of FS/NC was 63%. We attributed the differences in selectivity to the interaction between the Fe and Sn single sites, while the Fe&#8211;O clusters are inactive for this reaction. Double-layer capacitance (CDL) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements confirmed a larger electrochemically active surface area and lower charge-transfer resistance, respectively, in FSNC. In addition, FSNC demonstrated a high CO FE (90%) under acidic conditions (pH = 2.1), demonstrating that this electrocatalyst can effectively suppress the HER under acidic conditions. Moreover, 5 cm2 electrodes containing FSNC were fabricated, and their stability was tested for 20 h of continuous operation in an electrochemical flow cell at different current densities (50&#8211;350 mA/cm2), demonstrating improved stability at high current densities and under acidic conditions. Finally, FSCN-based cathodes were also tested in a Zn&#8211;CO2 battery, achieving a maximum power density of 2.54 mW/cm2 at 0.48 V with a current density of 5.2 mA/cm2 and demonstrating outstanding rechargeability and stability upon 50 continuous charge&#8211;discharge cycles for 50 h.</description>

                In response to the need to develop green low-carbon iron smelting technology, blast furnace hydrogen reduction technology is of great significance for reducing CO2 emissions from the ironmaking system. This study focuses on the change in swelling behaviour of different types of pellets during the blast furnace hydrogen smelting process. It analyses the reduction swelling index (RSI/%) and compression strength before and after reduction at 900&#176;C in a variety of reduction gas atmospheres, among other indices. The results show that under the condition of ore grade, the reduction expansion rate of pellet increases with the increase of grade. With the increase of basicity (R) (0 &#8764; 0.25) and the Mg-Al ratio (M/A) (0.4 &#8764; 1.4), the reduction in expansion of the pellet shows an upward trend. However, the RSI/% shows a downward trend with the increase of the synergistic effect of ore silicon and aluminium (S + A). The compression strength after reduction increases to different degrees with the increase of the proportion of hydrogen in the reduction atmosphere; the maximum increase was about 0.591 KN. SEM-EDS detection was carried out on pellet in different reduction atmospheres, and the structure and component changes of various regions during the reduction process were analysed.</description>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted attention as a promising strategy for converting CO2 into value-added products. Gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) loaded with metallic nanoparticles as electrocatalysts are expected to efficiently reduce CO2 due to the high specific surface area of such particles and the superior mass transport characteristics of GDEs. In the present study, GDEs loaded with homogeneous layers of gold (Au) nanoparticles were fabricated using a radio frequency sputtering technique that had a low deposition rate. This allowed for precise control of the catalyst loading. The Au-loaded GDEs exhibited a significantly higher CO production efficiency compared with the electrodes fabricated by conventional deposition methods using dispersed Au nanoparticles. Additionally, a Au-loaded GDE having a catalytic layer thickness of 10 nm demonstrated a mass-based CO production activity of 1882 A g&#8211;1 at &#8722;0.85 V. This is the highest value yet reported. This work confirmed that the uniform deposition of metallic nanoparticles provides enhanced catalyst utilization. The results of this research provide important insights into the design of efficient CO2RR electrodes and highlight the potential of radio frequency sputtering to fabricate high-performance CO2RR electrodes as an approach to realizing carbon-neutral technologies.</description>

      <title>Carbon Free NH3 Co-firing Behavior in Fluidized Bed Reactor: Effect of Blending Ratio and Stoichiometric Ratio</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.15231/jksc.2024.29.4.061</link>

                NH3, as one of the carbon-free fuels, is emerging as a new energy source for power generation. NH3 is being partially introduced into thermal power plants, accelerating its practical application as a fuel. In this study, experiments are conducted to apply NH3 in circulating fluidized bed(CFB) boilers. The objective of this research is to investigate fundamentally the effects of NH3 co-firing ratios(0-50%) and the stoichiometric ratio(SR) on combustion and various exhaust emissions to derive the optimal conditions for NH3 co-firing with coal using a bubbling fluidized bed(BFB) reactor. Results indicate that as the NH3 co-firing ratio increased, the emission values of CO2 and SO2 generated from coal combustion decreased. as the NH3 co-firing ratio increase up to 30~40%, the NOx gradually increase while higher co-firing ratio result in lower NOx value because unburned NH3 remaining in the reducing zone contribute to NOx reduction by selective non-catalytic reduction(SNCR) reactions. Furthermore NH3 should be injected into an appropriate reducing zone with a low SR for effective NOx reduction.</description>

                ABSTRACT Alkaline salt stress, as a more diverse stress, severely affects the growth and development of potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) and leads to yield reduction. Brassinosteroids have been shown to regulate plant growth and play an essential role under environmental stress. However, the physiological responses by which brassinosteroids confer alkaline salt stress tolerance in potato remain unclear. We used potato &#8216; Atlantic &#8217; as experimental material. The effects of 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 &#956;mol&#183;L &#8722;1 of 24&#8208;epibrassinolide (EBR) on the physiological and photosynthetic characteristics of potato under alkaline salt stress (300 mmol&#183;L &#8722;1 NaHCO 3 ) were studied. The results showed that exogenous EBR increased the antioxidant enzyme activities, increased the content of osmoregulatory substances and decreased the production of peroxidation products in potato leaves under alkaline salt stress. EBR treatment improved the photosynthetic characteristics by accumulating more photosynthetic pigments. This was manifested by an increase in net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and stomatal conductance, and a decrease in intercellular carbon dioxide concentration. In addition, exogenous EBR increased the maximal quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry and the effective PSII quantum yield of potato PSII under alkaline salt stress and ultimately increased yield. Potato tuber yield was significantly increased by 27.31% and 29.17% in T4 treatment compared to T1 in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Cluster and correlation analyses further demonstrated the beneficial effects of exogenous EBR on physiology, photosynthetic characteristics and potato yield under alkaline salt stress. In conclusion, exogenous EBR can enhance the tolerance of potato to alkaline salt stress by improving the antioxidant system and photosynthesis.</description>

                To reduce the energy consumption and the total annual cost (TAC) of the conventional extractive distillation (CED) process, this study focuses on the process intensification by the combination of salt-based DESs entrainers, partial heat-integrated and intermediate reboilers for 2-propanol + water separation process. The vapor-liquid equilibrium experiments showed that (ChCl:U:CaCl2)1:2:0.36 is the most promising for the separation of 2-propanol and water among all of the entrainers investigated. Based on the thermodynamic study, the conceptual process design for CED was created to examine the competitiveness of the recommended entrainer in separating 2-propanol and water. When compared to the entrainer glycerol, the CED process using (ChCl:U:CaCl2)1:2:0.36 entrainer can reduce the total annual cost (TAC) by about 69.54%, the total energy consumption (TEC) by 70.66% and the CO2 emissions (ECO2) by 67.92%. To achieve the further energy saving, partial heat-integrated (PHI) scheme and partial heat-integrated combined with intermediate reboilers (PHI-IR) scheme are researched based on the CED process. For the most energy saving design, PHI-IR, it has 74.61% thermodynamic efficiency enhanced, 72.79% energy-saving, 70.25% reduction in total annual cost (TAC) and 74.47% reduction in CO2 emissions with the comparison of the CED process using glycerol entrainer. The results show that the PHI-IR scheme is energy-efficient, economical, and environmentally friendly for separating 2-propanol and water mixtures, with great industrial application potential.</description>

                &#8220;Cell factory&#8221; strategy based on microbial anabolism pathways offers an intriguing alternative to relieve the dependence on fossil fuels, which are recognized as the main sources of CO2 emission. Typically, anabolism of intracellular substance in cell factory requires the consumption of sufficient reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). However, it is of great challenge to modify the natural limited anabolism and to increase the insufficient level of NADPH and ATP to optimum concentrations without causing metabolic imbalance. Inspired by the natural photosynthesis process in which NADPH and ATP can both be produced through the coupled electron&#8208;proton transfer processes driven by sunlight, herein we designed a light&#8208;driven bionic system composed of three modules including photo&#8208;induced electron module, electron transfer channel module and proton gradient module. The proposed strategy of light&#8208;driven bionic system enables for achieving simultaneous and controllable supplies of NADPH and ATP, thus facilitating both highly efficient CO2 fixation and biomanufacturing. The proposed light&#8208;driven bionic system design strategy in this work might pave new sustainable ways for reducing power and energy regeneration to optimize microbial metabolism, offering intriguing alternatives for CO2 emission reduction and high value&#8208;added chemical biomanufacturing.</description>

                Introduction Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) are emerging treatment options. This study aimed to estimate the potential health system and associated environmental impacts of DMTs by modeling future bed-days and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions for the UK population under various scenarios for access to and efficacy of DMTs. Methods A cohort Markov model was developed to predict the UK population distribution from 2020 to 2040 across five health states&#8212;cognitively unimpaired and four stages of AD (mild cognitive impairment, and mild, moderate, severe dementia). These distributions were estimated using national population projections, AD prevalence data, and stage-specific transition rates. Annual bed-days per person for each state and associated CO 2 e emissions from published literature were applied to estimate total bed-days and emissions. Modeled scenarios combined ranges of DMT efficacy estimates (20 to 30%) and access levels (25 to 58% eligible patients receiving treatment) elicited from expert opinion to explore the extent of potential DMT impacts. Results Without DMT access, annual bed-days across the four AD stages were projected to increase from 5.5 million to 8.6 million from 2020 to 2040, with cumulative bed-days totaling 140 million. Associated annual emissions increased from 0.7 Mt to 1.1 Mt CO 2 e, reaching 17 Mt CO 2 e cumulatively from 2020 to 2040. Under the various high-access (58% eligible patients treated) DMT efficacy scenarios, relative to no DMT access, annual reductions of 430 thousand to 650 thousand bed-days and 54 kt to 81 kt CO 2 e were estimated by 2040, and cumulative emissions decreased by 419 kt to 633 kt CO 2 e. Decreasing DMT access to 25 percent, assuming 25 percent DMT efficacy, reduced annual bed-days by 230 thousand by 2040, and annual emission savings decreased to 29 kt CO 2 e. Conclusions DMTs for AD may contribute to efforts by healthcare systems to reduce the carbon emissions from hospital inpatient care. Environmental sustainability should be considered as part of a holistic value proposition when assessing the benefits of new medicines.</description>

      <title>The Intraday Impacts of Wind Energy on Wholesale Electricity Prices and Carbon Emissions in Great Britain</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5087315</link>

                This paper studies the intra-day impacts of wind power on wholesale electricity prices and carbon emissions in Great Britain. Exploiting hourly variations across years from 2008 to 2019, we differentiate the longer-term impact of wind power, largely due to capacity increases, and the short-term impact driven by weather conditions. The results show that the expansion of wind energy significantly decreases wholesale electricity prices in most hours, although the effect is not uniform. The prices decrease more during peak hours than during off-peak hours, with no significant effect during the ramping-up and ramping-down hours. However, over the sample period, the negative effects of wind expansion and load reduction on wholesale electricity prices are more than offset by the increases in carbon and fuel prices. Wind expansion, load reduction, and increases in carbon prices all contributed to the significant reduction in CO2 emissions.</description>

                This study examines the relationship between productive capacity and CO2 emissions in Algeria, addressing the pressing challenge of sustainable development in the context of climate change. The aim is to explore how enhancing production capacity can influence environmental outcomes, particularly in terms of carbon emissions. To achieve this, the study employs an Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model, with results validated through an Error Correction Model (ECM), using data from 1990 to 2023. The findings reveal that improvements in productive capacity contribute to a long-term reduction in CO2 emissions per capita. However, an increase in energy consumption has the potential to undermine these gains, underlining the need for greater energy efficiency. Key policy recommendations suggest prioritizing investments in energy-efficient technologies, thereby enhancing Algeria&#8217;s productive capacity while minimizing environmental impact. This framework provides a valuable pathway for aligning economic growth with sustainable environmental practices, offering actionable insights for policymakers aiming to balance development with climate goals.</description>

                Medical implant manufacturing is a growing sector and therefore requires improved manufacturing practices. In the case of total hip arthroplasty, the most challenging component to meet the ISO standard (ISO 7206-2:2011) is the acetabular liner, often made from ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). UHMWPE machining is associated with several manufacturing challenges, including swarf control. This research used low frequency vibration (LFV), an intermittent cutting process and supercritical CO2 (scCO2) to aid chip segmentation and prevent swarf nesting. Machining trials have demonstrated a significant reduction in swarf nesting relative to a traditional process (91% reduction from LFV and 98% reduction when using LFV and scCO2). The surface roughness (*Ra_Symbol*) also had an indirect improvement from using LFV (53% reduction on the inner hemisphere), leading to all parts meeting the roughness requirement of ISO 7206-2:2011. The results have demonstrated machinability benefits for UHMWPE, reducing the operator intervention required and component scrap rates.</description>

      <title>Chest Wall Restriction Device for Modeling Respiratory Challenges and Dysfunction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.08.24319742</link>
      <description>Victoria Ribeiro Rodrigues, L. Hoyos Mejia, Riccardo Zucchi, Paul W Davenport, Nicola Napoli, medRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406201976

                Breathing relies on unrestricted movement of the chest wall to maintain oxygen and carbon dioxide balance. Understanding the effects of chest and abdominal restrictions on respiratory function is critical for studying conditions such as respiratory diseases, extreme environments, and load-induced impairments. However, existing methods to simulate these restrictions are limited, lacking the ability to provide both static and dynamic conditions or precise load control. To address these gaps, we developed a novel chest wall and abdomen restriction device capable of independently applying and measuring static and dynamic loads with adjustable and reproducible force levels. Separate bands for the chest and abdomen enable targeted restrictions, with constant force springs providing resistance during dynamic conditions and immobilization during static conditions. Integrated sensors quantify applied loads and respiratory mechanics. To validate the device, healthy participants underwent pulmonary function testing and respiratory analysis under baseline, static restriction, and dynamic restriction conditions. Significant reductions in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were observed under restrictions compared to baseline. Other respiratory metrics, including inspiratory volume, inspiratory time, and peak inspiratory airflow, also showed significant differences, highlighting distinct effects of static and dynamic restrictions. Pressure variability tests confirmed the reproducibility and adjustability of applied loads, while displacement data from linear variable differential transducers (LVDTs) validated the device's ability to distinguish static and dynamic effects. This device addresses prior limitations by enabling precise, reproducible loading and independent control of chest and abdominal restrictions. Its versatility supports research into respiratory diseases, extreme environments, and respiratory mechanics. The results demonstrate the device's potential to advance respiratory function research and expand its clinical and experimental applications.</description>

                This study aims to explore the impact of implementing the Milk Run method in supply chain of plastic industry in PT RPI. By reducing the distance of 48 km per day, equivalent to 1,200 km in a month of deliveries, the research highlights significant changes in logistics&#8217; efficiency, cost savings, and carbon emission reduction. More connected travel patterns allow trucks to combine pick-ups or deliveries of multiple sources in single trip to enhance the overall logistics&#8217; efficiency. Reducing the distance contributes to saving transportation&#8217;s cost by lowering fuel consumption and maintaining vehicle expenses. Reducing a 1,200 km distance, assumed that a fuel consumption rate of 7 km per liter and a carbon emission rate of 2.68 kg CO2 per liter, could result in a substantial carbon emission reduction. This study provides a foundation for further research, including route and scheduling optimization, in-depth environmental impact analysis, and Milk Run implementation in other industries. The findings offer a comprehensive overview of Milk Run effectiveness in the plastic industry, emphasize operational advantages, economic impact, and commitment to sustainability.</description>

                ABSTRACT Bio-based materials, including wood, non-woody plants, marine materials, and biochar resources, have attracted interest for use in cement and concrete composites in recent years. This review investigates the diverse resources of bio-based materials and their functionalities in different aspects of concrete composites, such as mechanical properties, carbon capture, sound absorption, and self-healing. The results show that plant-based materials play an important role in reinforcement fillers and present functionalities for carbon capture, energy storage, and crack self-healing. By incorporating 0.1&#8211;4% of various types of bio-based materials, it demonstrates that there is no adverse effect on the mechanical properties of concrete composites. This incorporation also results in a significant reduction in CO2 emissions through C-capture, thereby offering greener construction products. There is limited documentation on the concrete self-healing functionality of seashells, eggshells, and biochar-based materials. However, plant-based materials exhibit good self-healing functionality, making it possible for the advancement of functional bio-based materials in the construction industry. These advantages include good mechanical properties, good self-healing functionality, and reduced CO2 emissions.</description>

                Greenhouse gas emission from ships is currently one of the environmental issues for the shipping industry. Considering the marine air conditioning system consumes much energy on board ships, and to improve its efficiency and thus reduce CO2 emission, an ice thermal energy storage (ICE-TES) unit was designed and integrated into a marine air conditioning system on a real ship. Four cases distinguished with the shaved peak value of cooling load as 4%, 8%, 12%, and 16% were analyzed, and with the increasing shaving percent the integration of ICE-TES unit could reduce more electricity consumed for air cooling, and a upmost reduction of 1.49% was achieved (saved fuel by 33.99 kg/day). Furthermore, the rated power of compressor was optimized subsequently, the corresponding average COP of the system was enhanced from 2.36 to 2.45, and the saving in electricity consumption was promoted to 5.23% (saved fuel by 95.53 kg/day). Environmental analysis showed that CO2 emission was reduced by up to 2.84%, and the payback period for the optimized system could be shortened to 2.50 years. Thus this study proves the feasibility of the integration of ICE-TES unit with central air conditioning systems specifically for marine applications.</description>

      <title>Graphitic Carbon Nitride: Achieving Superlow Friction and Wear on Engineering Steel</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaenm.4c00696</link>

                Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a typical two-dimensional (2D) material acclaimed for its layered structure and electronic properties, showcasing promise across various domains such as catalysis, CO2 reduction, and lubrication. In this study, g-C3N4 is synthesized as an oil-based nanoadditive within oleic acid (OA), exhibiting superlow friction coefficient (COF) within steel/steel contacts under high pressure. When dispersed g-C3N4 in OA at a concentration of 0.25 wt %, the COF is reduced from 0.077 to 0.022 compared to the base oil. The amino groups in g-C3N4 promote the formation of continuous friction films, creating a composite tribofilm made of carbon layers, carbon nitride, and iron oxides. This tribofilm effectively prevents direct contact between tribopairs, leading to significant friction reduction and enhanced antiwear properties. These findings offer insights into the design of lubricant additives for base oils and highlight the promising potential of carbon nitride in lubrication and tribology applications.</description>

      <title>Chemical Equilibrium and Energy Consumption Analysis on Biomass and Iron Oxides Direct Reduction Ironmaking Process</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/met15010057</link>

                Biomass ironmaking is crucial for carbon reduction in the ironmaking industry. To understand this process better, the iron production capacity and energy requirements of biomass were studied. A thermodynamic equilibrium model and energy consumption model for the biomass and iron oxide reduction system at 100&#8211;1300 &#176;C was established by the minimum free Gibbs energy method. The effects of factors such as biomass type, temperature, and initial amount of iron oxide on the system were analyzed. The research results indicated that the maximum ironmaking capacity of biomass was determined by the element content of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in biomass and temperature. The equilibrium H2/(H2 + H2O) and CO/(CO + CO2) at the maximum iron yield were affected not by the biomass species and element content, but by temperature. The reduction capacity of the ten selected biomass types decreased with a temperature increase from 700 &#176;C to 1300 &#176;C. For the 1 kg of pine sawdust and iron oxide system, the maximum equilibrium state amount of metallic iron was 23.05 mol at 718 &#176;C, and the minimum system energy consumption per ton Fe was 1.16 GJ at 800 &#176;C and 1.18 GJ at 900 &#176;C. These research results will provide a key basis for a deeper understanding of the intrinsic mechanism of biomass ironmaking.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en18020232</link>

                Energy shortage and greenhouse gas emission have become bottlenecks in current society development. Improving the efficiency of energy conversion and utilization systems through waste heat recovery and reduction of greenhouse gas through CO2 capture/conversion are important solutions. Both can be achieved simultaneously by utilizing high-temperature flue gas or CO2 in flue gas for organic matter gasification, which is called the flue gas chemical recuperative cycle. This paper provides a meaningful review of the latest advancements in the flue gas chemical recuperative cycle system, focusing on its application in diverse gasification systems for organic matters such as methane, sludge, etc. Additionally, this paper reviews methods for the integration of flue gas gasification into energy conversion and utilization systems under the application scenarios of gas turbine flue gas, air combustion flue gas, and oxy-fuel combustion flue gas. Subsequently, in order to improve the conversion efficiency of the chemical recuperative cycle, the applications of emerging gasification technologies in the field of the flue gas recuperative cycle, such as microwave gasification, plasma gasification, etc., are briefly summarized, offering an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms by which new methods enhance the process. Finally, the prospects and challenges of the field are discussed, and a comprehensive outlook is provided to guide future research.</description>

      <title>Environmental and public health implications of CO2 migration - causal networks as an evaluation tool</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5069864</link>
      <description>Linda Stalker, Karsten Michael, Charles Jenkins, Kate L. Holland, Luk Peeters, Matthew Myers, Andrew S. Ross, Noreen Clarke, SSRN Electronic Journal. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406170840

                In reviewing the literature related to risks of leakage or seepage of CO2 into the near surface, it can become challenging to evaluate what the material risks and consequences might be. This is particularly the case for policy makers, regulators, stakeholders and the general public. IEAGHG commissioned a study to help present some of the well-known canon (to long-term researchers of CCS) in measurement, monitoring and verification of CO2 in the subsurface, and how leakage might result in any material consequences to the environment or public health in the shallow subsurface and surface environments. This was done using a causal network approach to illustrate/review various aspects of what could happen during leakage events and evaluate the likelihood and consequences of those potential events in a consistent manner. The basis of this work was a comprehensive review of previous research related to the environmental impacts of CO2 leakage including natural analogues, controlled-release field trials, geochemical laboratory experiments and numerical modelling studies. Critical aspects for describing and quantifying consequences include CO2 leakage pathways, rates and volumes, sensitivity of environmental receptors, animals and humans, and general climate risks, limits of detection using state of the art equipment and what mitigation options might be available. Causal networks are an effective approach to demonstrating the chain of effects, risks and mitigation strategies for specific target locations for onshore gas developments. A simplified offline tool was developed that uses many of the same workflows to summarize/review different aspects of CCS before highlighting risks, consequences and mitigation strategies that are currently described in the literature. A series of nodes make up the flow path from the major driving force, that is emissions reduction, through to endpoints or impacts. Definitions and detailed reviews underpin each node, and a systematic assessment concludes each nodal section. This allows the reader to consider aspects that are of interest, rather than following a linear and traditional reporting format. The broad conclusion from this work is that while many of the processes are possible, they only have material impacts in rare instances that mostly can be mitigated. It should be noted that this is a global evaluation and that the same workflow may result in a different risk assessment locally for a specific geographic area and project. This key message is important to communicate in a clear, facts-based approach to help the deployment of CCS projects.</description>

      <title>Association between cerebral oxygenation and usual parameters of cerebral perfusion in critically ill patients with acute brain injury</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678x241310780</link>
      <description>Timoth&#233;e Ayasse, Samuel Gaugain, Charles de Roquetaillade, Alexis Hermans-Didier, Manuel Kindermans, Benjamin G. Chousterman, Romain Barth&#233;l&#233;my, Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow &amp; Metabolism. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406127127

                In patients with acute brain injury (ABI), optimizing cerebral perfusion parameters relies on multimodal monitoring. This include data from systemic monitoring&#8211;mean arterial pressure (MAP), arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2 ), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ), hemoglobin levels (Hb), and temperature&#8211;as well as neurological monitoring&#8211;intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities. We hypothesized that these parameters alone were not sufficient to assess the risk of cerebral ischemia. We conducted a retrospective, single-center study of patients admitted in our ICU between 2015 and 2021. Patients with ABI and multimodal neuromonitoring were included. ABI included traumatic brain injury (TBI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracranial hemorrhage and ischemic stroke. The relationship between jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO 2 ) and cerebral perfusion parameters was analyzed. Patients were categorized into two groups based on SjvO 2 , with a threshold of 60% used to define cerebral ischemia. We compared the parameters used to optimize cerebral perfusion between groups and their diagnosis accuracy for cerebral ischemia was evaluated. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess the association between the guideline-recommended therapeutic targets and the risk of cerebral ischemia. 601 evaluations from 96 patients with simultaneous ICP, SjvO 2 and TCD were analyzed. Poor relationships were found between SjvO 2 and the parameters of cerebral perfusion. TCD flow velocities and PaCO 2 were lower in the cerebral ischemia group while MAP, ICP and CPP were not different between groups. Most ischemic episodes occurred despite ICP &lt; 22 mmHg and CPP &#8805; 60 mmHg. For the diagnosis of cerebral ischemia, only TCD parameters and PaCO 2 were associated with an area under the curve (AUC) &gt; 0.5 but with a low accuracy. In multivariable analysis, the only guideline-recommended therapeutic target associated with a reduction of cerebral ischemia was a diastolic flow velocity (FV) &gt; 20 cm.s &#8722;1 .</description>

      <title>The Philippines&#8217; Energy Transition: Assessing Emerging Technology Options Using OSeMOSYS (Open-Source Energy Modelling System)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/cli13010014</link>
      <description>Lara Dixon, Rudolf Yeganyan, Naomi Tan, Carla Cannone, Mark Howells, Vivien Foster, Fernando Plazas-Ni&#241;o, Climate. 13(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406167139

                The Philippines aspires for a clean energy future but has become increasingly reliant on imported fossil fuels due to rising energy demands. Despite renewable energy targets and a coal moratorium, emissions reductions have yet to materialize. This study evaluates the potential of offshore wind (floating and fixed), floating solar PV, in-stream tidal, and nuclear power to contribute to a Net-Zero energy plan for the Philippines, utilizing the Open-Source Energy Modelling System (OSeMOSYS). Seven scenarios were analyzed, including least-cost, renewable energy targets; Net-Zero emissions; and variations in offshore wind growth and nuclear power integration. Floating solar PV and offshore wind emerged as key decarbonization technologies, with uptake in all scenarios. Achieving Net-Zero CO2 emissions by 2050 proved technically feasible but requires substantial capital, particularly after 2037. Current renewable energy targets are inadequate to induce emissions reductions; and a higher target of ~42% by 2035 was found to be more cost-effective. The addition of nuclear power showed limited cost and emissions benefits. Emissions reductions were projected to mainly occur after 2038, highlighting the need for more immediate policy action. Recommendations include setting a higher renewables target, offshore wind capacity goals, a roadmap for floating solar PV, and better incentives for private investment in renewables and electric transport.</description>

      <title>Carbon-free Energy Transition in Thermal Power Plant:Ammonia Injection Strategies Analysis in Boiler Simulator</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.15231/jksc.2024.29.4.001</link>
      <description>Sang-Keun Song, Ji Hwan Lee, Hyeong-Bin Moon, Seung-Mo Kim, Gyeong-Min Kim, Chung&#8208;Hwan Jeon, Journal of the Korean Society of Combustion. 29(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406228337

                The International Energy Agency(IEA) predicts that by 2050, hydrogen and ammonia will account for approximately 19% of the global energy demand. Ammonia, with a high hydrogen content and a higher boiling point than hydrogen, presents itself as a favorable energy storage medium. This study investigates the effects of ammonia injection position and coal grade on combustion characteristics and emissions in coal-fired power plants as part of the transition towards carbon neutrality. ADTF(Ammonia Drop Tube Furnace) experiments were conducted to assess NOx, CO2, N2O, and NH3 slip emissions under low-load conditions. The findings from ADTF experiments indicate that ammonia injection position significantly impacts combustion characteristics and emissions. Coal B, a lower grade coal with high volatile matter, exhibited better combustion characteristics and lower UBC emissions compared to Coal A. NOx emissions were influenced by the ammonia injection position, with a low injection position leading to NOx reduction due to the effect of ammonia as a reducing agent in the combustion environment. Mixed coal showed trends similar to Coal A, but it could serve as a solution for utilizing high-grade coal and exhibited better emission levels in some aspects compared to single coal cases. So, underscores the potential of ammonia-coal co-firing in achieving significant emission reductions and enhancing the combustion efficiency of coal-fired boilers.</description>

                To address the pressing demand for hyphenated in situ characterization of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces at the molecular level, we report herein a technical note to demonstrate the hyphenation of in situ electrochemical surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and shell-isolated nanoparticle enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS). The core setup incorporates a top-down configured Raman optic fiber head loaded on a 3-dimension positioning module and a bottom-up configured attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) spectroelectrochemical cell accommodated in a custom-designed optical accessory. The feasibility of this integrated design is initially validated by the simultaneous measurement of two model systems, namely, potential dependent adsorption of pyridine on a Au film electrode and the CO2 reduction reaction on a Cu film electrode by in situ SEIRAS and SHINERS, yielding distinct and complementary spectral information.</description>

      <title>Fueling Climate Solutions: A Federal Clean Fuel Standard (Cfs) for the USA</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5095478</link>
      <description>Cato Sandford, Chris Malins, Maria Cecilia P. Moura, J. L. Martin, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406306068

                A clean fuel standard (CFS) is a regulatory instrument that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the use of transportation fuel. It establishes a lifecycle emissions benchmark (the 'compliance schedule') against which fuels may be rewarded or penalized. This paper explains the CFS mechanism and examines the prospects for a national CFS in the USA that covers road and aviation segments. We introduce the CFS Scenario Compliance Model (CSCM), and two ambitious scenarios of transportation decarbonization which are consistent with an economy that reaches net zero emissions in 2050. Our 'High-ZEV' scenario is characterized by rapid transition of the vehicle fleet, while the 'High-Liquid' scenario emphasizes rapid scale-up of next-generation fuel production. These scenarios achieve a 87-94% reduction in road transportation carbon intensity by 2050. In addition, we model an ~84% reduction for aviation fuel (this includes carbon removals, but excludes the climate impact of aviation's non-CO2 emissions). Policy considerations for the design of a national CFS in the USA include the ambition of target-setting, investment support, and use of feedstock caps to mitigate sustainability risks. Cross-sectoral linkages mean that target-setting in transportation policy should be coupled with transitions towards renewable electricity and climate-efficient farming practices.</description>

      <title>Formation and Reactivity of Silicon Oxyhydrides in Nickel Hydrogenation Catalysts Supported on Silica</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-bd0d8</link>
      <description>Bram T. Kapp&#233;, Robin Vogel, Jaap N. Louwen, Bettina Baumgartner, Bert M. Weckhuysen, Matteo Monai, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406182944

                Silica is generally regarded as an inert support in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, including hydrogenation-dehydrogenation catalysis, on which hydrogen spillover is debated. Since supported hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysts are generally activated in H2 as reducing gas at medium-high temperatures (350&#8211;500 &#176;C), we suspected that hydride formation could occur during such catalyst pretreatments. In this work, we investigated silicon oxyhydride (SiHxOy, SiHx for brevity) formation during the reduction pretreatment of a set of Ni/SiO2 catalyst materials using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). We observed two distinct vibrational bands located at ~ 2275 and ~ 2257 cm&#8722;1, which we assigned to SiH and SiH2 species, as supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Since these vibrational bands are absent after hydrogenation of pure silica, we propose that the formation of hydrides was caused by hydrogen spillover from Ni metal nanoparticles supported on silica. The decrease in the band areas with rising temperature was used in a van t &#8216;Hoff plot to yield enthalpy values of ~ 26 and ~ 42 kJ/mol for the apparent reaction of hydride species, suggesting an equilibrium with IR-inactive or very mobile species. The reactivity of the SiHx species was also investigated, by dosing methanol, water and CO2 as probe molecules on the pre-reduced Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Methanol reacted the fastest with the hydride species, followed by water, while CO2 did not show any interaction with the hydrides. We anticipate this work will contribute to changing the view of silica as an inert support material, and to the understanding of H spillover in more general.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of a Turbulent Non-premixed Combustion Model for the Design of an Ammonia-fueled Burner</title>

                Ammonia has emerged as a carbon-free fuel to replace conventional fossil fuels for CO2 emission reduction. However, it has a low flame speed, low flame temperature, and potential for high NOx emissions compared to conventional fuels. Computation fluid dynamics(CFD) can play a key role in developing industrial ammonia-fueled burners to achieve stable ignition and suppress NOx-forming reactions. However, the large computational domain restricts the use of advanced models such as eddy dissipation concept(EDC) for consideration of the detailed reaction mechanism with turbulence-chemistry interaction. In this study, the performance of the steady and unsteady diffusion flamelet models(S/UDFM) for ammonia combustion was evaluated in a 80 kWth non-premixed swirl burner. Although S/UDFM overestimated N2O emissions, it effectively captured NOx and ammonia emission trends similar to that of EDC under different combustion conditions. When compared to experiments, S/UDFM predicted NO and NH3 emission trend effectively, making it a computationally efficient reaction model for CFD applications to design evaluation of industrial ammonia combustion systems.</description>

                Cu-based catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 and CO exhibit a perplexingly unique reactivity toward multicarbon based products compared to other studied electrocatalysts. Here we use insights gained from a recent phenomenological 3-site microkinetic model and grand-canonical density functional theory calculations to clarify the importance of an underemphasized aspect critical to Cu's unique reactivity: a population of so-called "reservoir" sites. Using model Cu surface motifs, we discuss how these types can be represented by undercoordinated structural defects like step edges and grain boundaries which form a network of highly anisotropic migration channels. These pathways are found to be amenable for feeding *CO over time to reactive sites like Cu adatoms more active toward C&#8211;C coupling. These results highlight an often overlooked aspect of catalyst optimization: reservoir site engineering, which exploits surface mobility and presents an equally important avenue for electrocatalyst engineering oversimply maximizing active site densities.</description>

                An overcrowded ethylene composed of electron&#8208;donating anion, naphthoxide, and electron&#8208;accepting cation, acridinium, has been synthesized. It is in equilibrium between a folded conformer having a smaller permanent dipole moment with visible light absorption and a twisted conformer having a larger permanent dipole moment with NIR light absorption. The overcrowded ethylene shows multiple NIR chromisms, such as solvatochromism, thermochromism, mechanochromism, vapochromism, halochromism, and amphoteric electrochromisms, which are caused by the conformational change between folded and twisted conformers or by controlling the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor moiety and the LUMO of the acceptor moiety. The small difference between the HOMO energy level of naphthoxide moiety and the LUMO energy level of acridinium moiety, and their weak interaction are crucial for NIR absorption and large dipole moment in the twisted conformer. The drastic change in the ratio of folded and twisted conformers by changing the polarity of solvents, the detection of CO2, and the disappearance of NIR absorption by electrochemical oxidation and reduction are noteworthy for this new type of organic dye.</description>

      <title>An analysis of the transport impact of finish building on-ramps and off-ramps from the Dnipro embankment to the Darnytskyi Bridge in Kyiv</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.56318/as/2.2024.172</link>

                This study was aimed at assessing the effectiveness of design solutions for the development of Kyiv&#8217;s transport infrastructure based on transport modelling and analysis of possible socio-economic effects. To do this, a four-step algorithm for modelling transport demand was used, based on data from sociological surveys, territory plans, and forecasts for 2030. The results of the study showed significant changes in the functioning of the Kyiv transport network as a result of the implementation of the proposed design solutions. The transport modelling helped to estimate quantitative indicators such as traffic volumes on major highways, as well as qualitative changes such as reduced congestion, shorter travel times, and cost savings. One of the key results was that the opening of new exits and entrances to the Darnytskyi Bridge on the left bank contributed to a slight increase in bridge capacity, but the biggest effect was seen on the approaches to the bridge. The additional approaches have increased traffic volumes, which indicates improved transport accessibility for drivers using this transport hub. The results related to environmental performance were also important. The reduction in congestion resulted in a reduction in CO2 emissions, which is a significant contribution to improving the environmental situation in the city. In terms of cost-effectiveness, the results demonstrated significant savings in transport losses, confirming that the implementation of the proposed measures has a positive impact on transport infrastructure, as well as reducing financial losses associated with travel. Thus, the results of the study confirmed that the proposed design solutions have a positive impact on the development of the transport network, increasing capacity and reducing negative environmental impact, which opens up opportunities for creating a more efficient transport system that meets the requirements of sustainable development and improves the overall quality of life of Kyiv residents</description>

                Background/Objectives On March 11, 2020, our hospital adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic by becoming a temporary COVID facility, leading to the suspension or delegation of non-COVID services. Among the international IBD community, there were significant concerns regarding the neglect of immunocompromised IBD patients and their increased vulnerability to COVID-19. To address these challenges, the COVID-19 ECCO Taskforce recommended the implementation of telehealth. Following this recommendation, our hospital&amp;#039;s IT department integrated audiovisual hardware and software solutions to facilitate virtual consultations. This approach enabled patients and their local physicians to receive formal reports comparable to those issued during standard in-person care. Methods We retrospectively analyzed data from patients diagnosed with Crohn&#8217;s disease and ulcerative colitis who participated in telemedicine consultations. Average distances and time saved were calculated using Google Maps, while carbon emissions and carbon footprint reductions were determined using tools from CarbonFootprint.com and CO2Meter.com. Results Between August 11, 2021, and June 15, 2023, 107 telehealth consultations were completed. Patients benefited from reduced travel distances, with an average saving of 168.28 km per consultation and a total reduction of 18,006 km. Travel time savings averaged 2 hours and 22 minutes per consultation, amounting to a total of 252 hours saved. The reduction in carbon emissions was calculated at 3.26 tons, equivalent to the annual absorption capacity of 109 fully grown trees, considering an individual tree absorbs approximately 21.77 kg of CO2 annually. These findings underscore telemedicine&#8217;s role in reducing environmental impact while enhancing patient convenience. Conclusions The adoption of telehealth has successfully optimized outpatient clinic operations, maintaining high-quality patient outcomes while contributing to environmental sustainability.</description>

                Densely populated urban megacities, such as the Metropolitan Area of Mexico City, face the ongoing deterioration of air quality. Emissions from industrail factories and internal combustion vehicles are the main sources of pollutants. We have evaluated different transition trends from internal combustion engine vehicles as bus, truck and van, and motorcycle to electric vehicles through 2050. The total vehicle growth follows a second-degree polynomial trend. Bus growth exhibits a linear trend. Truck and van growth display a second-degree polynomial trend. Motorcycle growth also follows a second-degree polynomial trend. We found that the most significant reductions in transportation emissions are observed in CO2, followed by NOx, volatile organic compound (VOC), and particulate matter, with light and heavy vehicles being the primary contributors to total emissions. Mexico City serves as a pilot laboratory where both the challenges and potential solutions to an issue affecting millions of citizens can be observed. If proven effective and practical, these solutions could be applied to other megacities.</description>

      <title>Highly Efficient Metal-Free Coal-Based Carbon Aerogel Catalyst for Oxygen Reduction to Produce Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.4c03929</link>
      <description>Lingman Xia, Mingsheng Luo, Changke Shao, Yang Zhi, Huanqiao Song, Rehab O. Abdel Rahman, Ziyuan Li, Xing Cui, Wenshuai Yang, Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406276876

                In this study, a highly efficient metal-free catalyst derived supported on coal-based carbon aerogel was successfully synthesized for the two-electron transfer oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8211; ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The catalyst, with its high specific surface area and hierarchical porous structure, demonstrated exceptional selectivity for H2O2 under alkaline conditions. By optimization of the synthesis and drying conditions, particularly through the use of supercritical drying technology, the physicochemical properties and selectivity of the catalyst were significantly enhanced. Notably, the coal-based carbon gel obtained through supercritical drying with CO2 exhibited the superior specific surface area over 1311 m2&#183;g&#8211;1. The H2O2 selectivity over 95% at a potential of 0.5 V vs SHE was obtained using the catalyst material synthesized from this study. It was also revealed that the high selectivity was attributed to the layered edge active sites, which are rich in carbonyl (C=O) and carboxyl (COOH) groups. In situ FTIR and Raman spectroscopic analyses confirmed the two-electron-transfer ORR reaction mechanism from this study.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Technologies for Resource Recovery from Waste: A Case Study for Better Integrating Environmental and Economic Issues</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1201/9781003561040-4</link>
      <description>Alfredo &#193;vila Galarza, Claudia Yazm&#237;n Ortega Montoya, Norma Lilia L&#243;pez-D&#237;az, Any Lucely Sierra-Negrette, Apple Academic Press eBooks. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406198611

                The current linear mode of production and consumption generates high environmental impacts at its final stage. In Mexico, urban waste is managed by local authorities, which is a relevant challenge considering the continuous increase of waste generation, the low efficiency in waste collection, and the high investment needed for a proper final disposal. Organic waste in Mexico is estimated at 56,427 TPD. Anaerobic decomposition of municipal solid waste generates mainly methane, a toxic gas that pollutes the air and has a global warming potential of 22 CO2 eq. At disposal sites, it is important to manage waste properly to control, manage, exploit, and/or mitigate GHG emissions. The use of biogas for power generation can be an alternative to valorize it, reducing GHG emissions to meet the international GHG reduction commitments, considering the importance of this sector in the national emissions inventory. This 50chapter presents an overview of the problem of air emissions related to the waste sector in Mexico and the challenges related with biogas management faced by Mexican municipalities throughout the case study of the generation and energy potential of biogas in San Luis Potos&#237;, a Mexican municipality, analyzing social, legal, and technological barriers obstructing progress and proposing proper solutions.</description>

      <title>Alkali-Activated Mineral Residues in Construction: Case Studies on Bauxite Residue and Steel Slag Pavement Tiles</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma18020257</link>
      <description>Lubica Kriskov&#225;, Vilma Ducman, Mojca Loncnar, An&#382;e Tesovnik, Gorazd &#381;ibret, Dimitra Skentzou, Costa Georgopoulos, Materials. 18(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406222396

                This research aimed to investigate the potential of using alkali activation technology to valorize steel slag and bauxite residue for the production of high-performance pavement blocks. By utilizing these industrial by-products, the study seeks to reduce their environmental impact and support the development of sustainable construction materials. Lab-scale testing showed that bauxite pavers showed a decrease in mechanical strength with increasing replacement of ordinary Portland cement. Partial replacement up to 20% still exceeded 30 MPa in compressive strength. Steel slag-based pavers achieved the 30 MPa threshold required for the application with selected mix designs. Pilot-scale production-optimized formulations and standards testing, including freeze&#8211;thaw resistance, confirmed the technical viability of these products. Life cycle analysis indicated a 25&#8211;27% reduction in CO2 emissions for slag-based tiles compared to traditional concrete tiles. Moreover, using industrial residue reduced mineral resource depletion. This study examined the properties of the resulting alkali-activated binders, their ecological benefits, and their performance compared to conventional materials. Through a comprehensive analysis of these applications, our research promotes the circular economy and the advancement of sustainable construction products.</description>

      <title>Flame Retardancy and Heat Shielding in Green Polypropylene Composites Using Biohybrid Fibers and Agro-Waste Fillers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsabm.4c01733</link>
      <description>Thanh Mai Nguyen Tran, M. N. Prabhakar, Lee Dong Woo, Song Jung-il, ACS Applied Bio Materials. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406252855

                The current work presents the flame-retardant performance of hybrid polypropylene composites, reinforced with specific short woven flax fabrics (SWFs), short basalt fibers (BFs), and rice husk powder (RHP), using polypropylene grafted maleic anhydride (MAPP) as the coupling agent. Horizontal burning test (HBT), microcalorimeter test (MCT), and cone calorimeter test (CCT) were conducted on these composites. The formulations used were 25% SWF/PP, 25% SWF/20% BF/PP, and 25% SWF/20% BF/PP with 6% RHP and 25% SWF/20% BF/PP with varying RHP contents (6, 12, and 18%) in combination with 6% MAPP. A peak heat release rate (pHRR) reduction of 14.42% was recorded in microcalorimeter test results. However, cone calorimeter test results indicated a reduction of 80.95% in pHRR and 23.84% in total heat release rate (THR). Furthermore, the emissions of CO and CO2 were reduced by 68 and 67%, respectively, in the 25SWF/20BF/PP.6MAPP-18RHP composite compared to pure PP, indicating an overall improvement in combustion efficiency. Fire performance index (FPI) also improved remarkably: FPI increased by 130% and fire growth index (FGI) improved by 81.34%. Moreover, the horizontal burning test showed an improved performance, with the burning rate further reduced by 11.10% compared to that of the 25% SWF/PP composite. These results highlight the synergy among natural fibers, agro-waste fillers, and MAPP in improving flame retardancy of polypropylene composites, and hence their potential application in automobiles and construction, where the demand for fire safety is very high.</description>

      <title>Planet 2050 and the Future of Manufacturing: Data-Driven Approaches to Sustainable Production in Large Vehicle Manufacturing Plants</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5023000</link>
      <description>Shakir Syed, SSRN Electronic Journal. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406209158

                This paper explores the future of manufacturing plants in large vehicle manufacturing through the lens of a single large European vehicle manufacturing complex. An example of a plant that originally massmanufactured a single line of products, the complex is currently navigating a shift to more complex mixed model production and the production of electric vehicle powertrains. Using innovative datasets generated through a year-long stakeholder co-design process, a diverse set of partners collectively formed a project to design new, data-driven approaches to the challenge. The project collected and explored diverse data sources, including product bills of materials, facility layout data, current manufacturing system capabilities, energy usage and carbon generation, machine uptime and failures, factory control strategies, planning processes, and product quality data. The paper provides a summary of the explored data, key analyses, feedback from the stakeholders, early technical project interpretations, as well as broader project reflections and contextual descriptions of the factory-particularly of its goals and current challenges. The project supported stakeholders in exploring the potential of digital approaches to transform and facilitate the current manufacturing system's CO2 reduction pathway. The paper concludes by outlining several thematic issues facing large vehicle manufacturing plants.</description>

                This study aims to explore the explosive behaviors of CO/H2/CO2/air premixed gases in a narrow-gap disk burner, focusing on the effects of volume fraction of hydrogen (&#947;) and equivalence ratios (&#934;) on flame evolution and pressure characteristics. The results show that the folding of the flame front is enhanced as the &#934; decreases. However, the change in fold degree is negligible when the &#934; decreases from 1.6 to 1.2. Pmax increases with &#934; initially then decreases, reaching a peak value of 308 kPa at &#934; = 1.2. Pmax is positively correlated with &#947;. Increasing the &#934; and &#947; significantly reduces the time to reach Pmax and the propagation time, with a maximum reduction of 53.2%. Regardless of variations in &#1060; or &#947;, the flame stretch rate exhibits two peaks when the flame front reaches approximately 17 mm and 80 mm, indicating that this trend is independent of the gas composition. Analysis of the effective Lewis number, thermal expansion rate, and flame thickness reveals that thermo-diffusive instability plays a key role in the formation of flame folds in lean combustion conditions. This study provides new insights into the explosion characteristics of premixed gases and flame instabilities, contributing to improved burner design and combustion safety control.</description>

      <title>Theoretical to Experimental Investigation: A Waste Utilization Technique for Iron Recovery</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5089968</link>

                Copper slag and tire char are both large-scale industrial solid wastes, which pose a huge threat to the environment if not treated appropriately. Copper slag has 41 wt.% iron content, which can meet the growing demand of iron and solve its handling problem. Tire char has 97 wt.% fixed carbon thus can be used as a reductant along with CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 as additives in carbothermal reduction process. Results showed that 0.11 moles of CaCO3 and Ca(OH)2 at 900 oC for 60 minutes give 98.9% and 95.4% iron recovery respectively. Microstructural evaluation of the product demonstrated that fayalite was converted to metallic iron through tire char reductant, along with CO2 from CaCO3 and H2 from Ca(OH)2 also played their parts for the reducing, decomposing, grain growing processes and releasing of iron from complex iron-hosting mineral i.e., fayalite. Aspen plus simulation indicated 0.69 mole ratio of calcium salts recovers 99% Fe from copper slag which is quite similar to the experimental investigation. By offering a new and environmental friendly approach for detailed investigation of iron recovery from copper slag, this study provides a technical route for handling copper slag waste.</description>

                The building sector accounts for 30% of worldwide final energy usage and 26% of global energy-linked emissions. In construction, innovative materials and systems can offer flexible, lightweight, energy-efficient solutions to achieve more efficient buildings. This study addresses the energy analysis and environmental impacts of retrofitting residential buildings in Monterusciello, Italy, using an innovative second-skin fa&#231;ade system design that incorporates 3D-printed and fabric modules. The purpose is to enhance energy efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of residential buildings originally constructed with prefabricated elements that have degraded over time. This research employed TRNSYS modelling to simulate energy consumption and environmental impacts at the single-building and whole-district levels, analysing the system&#8217;s effectiveness in reducing cooling and heating demands and using different materials for optimal performance. The results show that retrofitting with the second-skin fa&#231;ade system significantly reduces cooling energy demand by 30.2% and thermal energy demand by 3.84%, reaching a primary energy saving of 16.4% and 285 tons of CO2 emissions reduction for the whole district. The results highlight the potential of second-skin fa&#231;ade systems in improving energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, suggesting future research directions in material innovation and adaptive system development for district-wide applications.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.086492</link>
      <description>Jenna M Peretin, Christopher M. Dustin, Maria Eugenia Cifuentes-Pagano, Patrick J. Pagano, Alberto L. Vazquez, Alzheimer s &amp; Dementia. 20(S6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406224515

                Abstract Background Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease associated with neuroinflammation and heightened production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain from overactive NADPH Oxidase 2 (NOX2). The current study examines whether administration of a novel, brain&#8208;penetrant NOX2 inhibitor (CPP11G &amp; CPP11H) reduces amyloid plaque load and improves AD&#8208;associated vascular dysfunction in a male APP&#8208;PS1 mouse model of AD. Method Intraperitoneal injections of CPP11G (n = 1) or CPP11H (n = 2) three times per week began at 9&#8208;10 months of age in the treatment APP&#8208;PS1 group (15 mg/kg). The control group of age&#8208;matched APP&#8208;PS1 mice received no treatment (n = 7). All mice were implanted with a 5mm cranial window for awake optical imaging at least 2 weeks prior to onset of treatment. Two&#8208;photon microscopy was performed to assess longitudinal changes in amyloid plaque deposition after weekly Methoxy&#8208;04 administration (1 mg/kg). Changes in plaque load were quantified weekly and averaged monthly. Additionally, wide&#8208;field optical imaging at 620nm was performed with a 90s, 8% CO2 hypercapnic challenge. This imaging wavelength is sensitive to changes in blood oxygenation (OIS&#8208;BOLD) to capture changes in vascular reactivity over time. Result Treatment with CPP11G/H shows a trend toward reduction in cortical plaque load when compared to an untreated cohort (Fig. 1). OIS&#8208;BOLD results for vascular reactivity studies show a slight trend of improved vascular function over time with CPP11G/H treatment (Fig. 2). Conclusion Our preliminary findings show a strong trend in amyloid plaque reduction with ongoing CPP11G/H treatment in older&#8208;aged AD mice and improved vascular function. Ongoing studies to increase the size of the treated cohort will reveal the reliability and statistical significance of CPP11G/H&#8217;s therapeutic benefits. We are also examining the impact of treatment on microglia activation and gliosis in APP&#8208;PS1::CX3CR1&#8208;GFP mice (Fig. 3).</description>

      <title>The Carbon Footprint of Clothing Considering the Relationship Between Clothing Layering and Heating Usage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su17020470</link>
      <description>Toshiro Semba, Atsushi Inaba, Ryuzo Furukawa, Norihiro Itsubo, Sustainability. 17(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406234276

                Approximately 20% of CO2 emissions from Japanese households are attributed to heating usage. Consequently, as part of its climate change policy, the Ministry of the Environment has promoted the &#8220;WARM BIZ&#8221; campaign, which encourages setting room temperatures to about 20 &#176;C during heating, through practices such as layering clothing. However, according to the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of clothing, the environmental impacts of clothing production, washing, and drying are significant. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate heating usage within the clothing lifecycle to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction effect of practicing WARM BIZ. In this study, we calculated the household heating energy consumption in four regions of Japan, and, by incorporating these data, estimated the GHG emissions over the clothing&#8217;s lifecycle, from production and use to disposal. The results showed that those practicing WARM BIZ had approximately 9 to 26% lower GHG emissions over the entire lifecycle than those who were not. Furthermore, by using the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index, it was shown that by adding a light long-sleeved shirt (0.18 clo), light long pants (0.18 clo), and a cardigan (0.37 clo) to the standard clothing scenario, the room temperature could be set 3.1 &#176;C lower than the current setting, potentially reducing GHG emissions over the entire lifecycle by approximately 18%.</description>

                Abstract This study examines how Climate-Related Financial Policies (CRFPs) support decarbonization and renewable energy transitions across 87 countries from 2000 to 2023. Using the Policy Sequencing Score (PSS) and a bindingness-weighted adoption indicator, it explores the relationships between CRFPs, CO2 emissions, and Renewable Energy Production (REP) across diverse economic and institutional contexts. Findings reveal significant variation in outcomes. Advanced economies and OECD countries leverage structured policies and robust institutions to achieve steady emissions reductions and REP growth, with diminishing returns at higher policy intensities. Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) face institutional and structural constraints but show strong responsiveness to targeted policies, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where renewable energy growth potential is notable. Regions such as Latin America and East Asia display mixed trends, reflecting unique challenges and opportunities. Binding policies prove essential for environmental outcomes, particularly in institutionalized settings, while EMDEs require capacity building and international cooperation to address barriers. This study highlights the importance of tailoring CRFPs to specific contexts, emphasizing policy sequencing, enforcement, and capacity building. By identifying global and regional variations, the findings provide actionable insights for aligning financial systems with climate goals, fostering a sustainable low-carbon transition, and addressing equity challenges.</description>

                The demand for high-speed, multi-functionality, and miniaturization of devices increases with a general acceptance of mobile communication devices such as smartphones and smartwatches in the next-generation 5G and IoT era. Undoubtedly, the semiconductor package of the mobile communication devices needs to be downsized with keeping function. One of the solutions is embedded die substrate technology, which is able to integrate passive components and active components with the minimum volume in the same body to implement heterogeneous integration. However, in the conventional embedded die substrate, the embedded die is fully covered by the substrate materials. This fact results in the generation of significant residual stress in the embedded components. Accordingly, the stress-sensitive components such as micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) sensor, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonator, and surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter are regarded unsuitable for embedding. In our previous study, we newly developed an embedded die substrate structure having a hollow chamber at both sides of the die to mitigate a severe limitation for the stress-sensitive devices [1]. Measurements of stress in a sensor chip embedded in substrate have indicated a significant reduction in stress achieved by the formation of the hollow chamber. The results have also suggested technology options for further reduction of stress. This paper will report the formation of slots in the resin material at the periphery of the die, which is newly developed for stress-free embedded die. The manufacturing flow of embedded die substrate with a hollow chamber starts from the formation of the cavity core frame using a conventional PCB process. The through-hole cavity is formed on an FR4 core frame by a router. The single-sided adhesive tacky tape, which enables to hold the die, is laminated by a roll laminator at the bottom side of the frame. The die is placed into the cavity with a face-down using a flip-chip bonder. After that, the cavity filling material is laminated by a vacuum laminator from the opposite side of the tacky tape. The die into the cavity is completely covered by filling material and proceed the cure at 190 &#176;C for 60 min. After die embedding, the thin layer of the filling material on the die is removed by CO2 laser ablation. After that, the tacky tape is peeled off at room temperature. Accordingly, both side of the die is exposed into the air, and the die is only held at the peripheral by the filling material. After embedding the die, a 6-um-thick copper redistribution (RDL) layer is formed by a semi-additive process (SAP) to connect the IO pads on the die. Then, the hollow chamber at both sides was formed by using cavity prepreg and FR4 core as a cap layer. Finally, laser via, 2nd copper RDL, solder mask, and singulation proceed, then the embedded die substrate is finalized. As a result, cavities are formed at the topside and bottom side of the die, and the die is mechanically held by the filling material only at the periphery. The above process was applied to embedding a piezo-resistance gauge chip, which is able to measure the stress and its distribution generated at the chip surface and evolution of the stress with the progress of the fabrication steps. After completing the packaging, the measurement was extended to the temperature dependency from -60&#176;C to 100&#176;C. The results clearly showed a significant reduction of residual die stress. They also revealed the effects of the material properties of the filling resin. However, even with low modulus filling material, the residual stress remained more than 22 MPa at 50&#176;C environments. To further reduce stress on the die for stress-free packaging, we newly introduce slits in the filling material at the periphery of the die. CO2 laser pulses were applied around the die to make a through-hole via or a through-hole slit in the filling material. We report a change in stress with the ratio of the slit from zero up to 80% as measured with the piezo-resistance gauge chip. Moreover, the effects of the position of the slit are discussed by taking stress concentration at the corner of the die into consideration. To summarize, this paper reports a newly developed fabrication process of embedded die substrate technology for mechanical stress-free packaging. The characteristic of the laser ablation is fully utilized to form a stress-releasing structure around the embedded die. This new technology will enable heterogeneous integration of stress-sensitive components in an embedded die substrate.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of arc quenching ability for SF6 replacements based on time-dependent Elenbaas&#8211;Heller and Boltzmann equations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0246444</link>
      <description>He Ren, Linlin Zhong, Journal of Applied Physics. 137(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406180448

                Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), a widely used arc quenching medium in the power industry, has been designated as a greenhouse gas, necessitating its reduction and replacement. Identifying eco-friendly alternatives to SF6 is a complex and expensive process, particularly since these alternatives often consist of gas mixtures that may function at varying pressures. In this work, we propose an efficient method for evaluating the arc quenching performance of gases or gas mixtures using the time-dependent Elenbaas&#8211;Heller and Boltzmann equations, which circumvents the computational costs associated with traditional 2D or 3D magnetohydrodynamic arc models. We segment the arc quenching process into four distinct stages: the thermal recovery stage, pre-dielectric recovery stage, post-dielectric recovery stage, and residual-gas cooling stage. To quantitatively assess arc quenching performance, we introduce two key parameters: recovery rate and recovery strength. The recovery rate is defined as the harmonic mean of thermal, pre-dielectric, and post-dielectric recovery rates. The recovery strength is characterized by the harmonic mean of the average recovery voltage, maximum critical electric field strength, and room-temperature dielectric strength. Our method is validated using several SF6 alternatives, including SF6 mixtures, C4F8, C4F7N, C5F10O, and their mixtures with CO2, N2, and O2. The results demonstrate that the coupling of the time-dependent Elenbaas&#8211;Heller and Boltzmann equations well describes the arc decaying process. Moreover, the proposed recovery rate and recovery strength metrics effectively quantify the arc quenching ability, enabling a systematic and efficient evaluation of various gas mixtures for arc interruption performance.</description>

      <title>A Combined Effect of Mixed Multi-Microplastic Types on Growth and Yield of Tomato</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/microplastics4010005</link>
      <description>C. U. Emenike, Adeola Adelugba, Mason T. MacDonald, Samuel K. Asiedu, Raphael Ofoe, Lord Abbey, Microplastics. 4(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406184237

                Microplastics (MPs) are plastic particles ranging from 1000 to 5000 &#181;m in diameter, posing a growing environmental and health risk. Composting is an excellent way to add nutrient-rich humus to the soil to boost plant development, but it also pollutes agricultural soil with MPs. Previous research has shown that MPs can threaten plant development, production, and quality, hence they must be studied. This study examined how a mixture of three MP types&#8212;polyethene (PE), polystyrene (PS), and polypropene (PP)&#8212;affected greenhouse tomato plant development. MP types were spiked at 1% w/w (MPs/soil) in tomato pots, whereas non-spiked growth medium was the control. Statistical analysis was conducted using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey&#8217;s test (95% confidence) to compare treatments and controls. Soil spiked with MPs increased chlorophyll content (SPAD), transpiration rate, photosynthetic rate, and stomata conductance by 5.16%, 16.71%, 25.81%, and 20.75%, respectively, compared to the control but decreased sub-stomata CO2 concentration by 3.23%. However, MPs did not significantly affect tomato plant morpho-physiological features (p &gt; 0.05). Biochemical analysis of tomato fruits showed significant (p &lt; 0.05) reduction effects of MPs on carotenoid, total flavonoid, and sugar but increased protein, ascorbate, and peroxidase activity. However, there was no significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) in the effects of the combined MPs on total phenolic content. These data imply that whereas MPs did not influence tomato plant physiological and morphological properties, tomato fruit biochemistry was reduced. This raise concerns that an increase in MPs in soils may reduce antioxidant content and negatively affect human health contributing to a decrease in food security.</description>

      <title>Evidence of the Functioning of the &#171;Green&#187; Economy (Case of the USA, Sweden, Costa Rica and Ukraine)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.32983/2222-4459-2024-11-36-45</link>
      <description>Olena &#1040;. Shuba, Iryna L. Didorchuk, Serhii D. Velihodskyi, Business Inform. 11(562)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406292836

                The purpose of the article is to analyze the experience of the functioning of the green economy in individual countries of the world. On the example of the USA, Sweden, Costa Rica and Ukraine, the existing global trends in the field of green economy were considered. In the United States, during the study period (1990&#8211;2022), the share of renewable sources increased from 11.8% to 21.5%. In Sweden, more than 50% of energy is produced from renewable energy sources, and the country&#8217;s government aims to completely abandon nuclear energy by 2040 and switch to 100% renewable energy generation. The largest share of energy production in Costa Rica comes from low-carbon energy sources. A significant problem in the field of the green economy of Costa Rica can be defined as the situation with plastic waste. From 1991 to 2022, Ukraine managed to reduce CO2 emissions by almost 80%; the production of energy from renewable sources increased (in 2021, 14% of production). The efficiency of waste processing was at a low level even before the war: as of 2021, only 7% of all waste was recycled. The war disrupted Ukraine&#8217;s existing plans to develop a green economy; the energy infrastructure, including the green components, was damaged. However, Ukraine has prospects for the development of a green economy, given that the recovery and reconstruction of the country will take place with the choice of environmental alternatives. In addition, potential accession to the European Union will require compliance with the current EU regulations in the field of emission reduction and improvement of recycling systems. The prospects for the development of the green economy in the world depend on the action of interrelated factors, including: the development of the energy sector, since renewable energy sources are one of the main priorities for most countries; the emergence of new technologies and the constant improvement of existing ones for the purpose of sorting and processing of secondary raw materials; the incentive policy on the part of the State, which includes legislation, regulations, directives, standards related to various aspects of the development of the green economy. Thus, it can be noted that the world has formed a trend of purposeful policy to support the development of the green economy.</description>

                The global consumption of fossil fuels such as diesel and gasoline represent a considerable per-centage of global emissions, it is important to know for sure the percentage and type of gas emitted, there are many alternative energies that mitigate the production of emissions in different sectors such as the transport sector and the energy sector. The percentage use of hydrogen mixed with gasoline in internal combustion engines is a viable alternative because it helps the com-bustion process, but it is necessary to know the behavior of the engine and determine the carbon footprint, to quantify the benefit of these actions it is necessary to design and implement a network of low-cost sensors that monitor the emissions produced during the combustion processes and provide reliable data that can be used to make a statistical comparison between vehicles. This research proposes two software systems of an architecture (client-server) working in a synchro-nized manner in order to collect and store information in a database. The first software works as the client and runs on an IoT development board called ESP32 in conjunction with esp32 ttgo and communication between both devices is done through the esp now protocol, this software estab-lishes the connection with the physical sensors to detect and collect gas information, the data is sent wirelessly to the web server, the second software works as a server in addition to providing a graphical interface for user control and data visualization from a ground station. The tests were carried out using 100% Mexican gasoline (G100) and a mixture of hydrogen fuel with gasoline (GH) for the hydrogen cell a concentration of 0.0211 ml / gal of electrolytes (80 ml) was used, the same route and vehicle were used at an average acceleration of 40 and 60 km / h, the data obtained are taken every 30 seconds, the process was repeated 3 times and an average emission reduction of 5% and 10% of CO and CO2 respectively was obtained with GH fuel.</description>

      <title>An Assessment of the Strategies for Energy Transition in Kenya as a Climate Change Mitigation Strategy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2024.8120172</link>
      <description>Bertha Othoche, International Journal of Research and Innovation in Social Science. VIII(XII)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406219453

                Climate change is a global issue affecting communities in different parts of the world. Climate change is associated with extreme weather and climate patterns that affect the general health of the environment and humanity. The causes of climate change are both natural and anthropogenic. The human induced climate change has accelerated the emission of greenhouse gases that in turn cause global warming and climate change. The international community have initiated various interventions to minimize emission of greenhouse gases in order to maintain a healthier environment for sustainable development. One such initiative and/or interventions is the energy transition strategy that involves transition from a purely fossil fuel based to renewable energy-based economy. This paper therefore looks at the energy transition in Kenya. Specifically, the paper covers energy demand and supply, Mt CO2 emission; energy transitions process; constraints and opportunities. Kenya is going through a transition period in the energy sector and at the same time the country is striving to industrialize by the year 2023 being guided by the Country&#8217;s 2010 Constitution and the Vision 2030 which aims at transforming the country into a middle level economy. It is important that as the country strives to industrialize, the energy that drives the economy should be clean to enhance cleaner energy production. The country is a signatory to the landmark agreement of COP21 held in Paris, France in 2015. The country committed to observe the requirements of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to ensure the reduction of emission of greenhouse gases and has put in place various institutional and legal frameworks towards this end. One of the most recent frameworks is the Climate Change Amendment Act, 2023. The main objective of the study is to assess the energy transition process and associated challenges. The study uses an exploratory design and employed descriptive statistics in data analysis. Data was presented in the form of tables, graphs, and themes. The result indicates that energy transition in Kenya is ongoing through specific processes and technologies. The results also confirm existing challenges and recommends sustained effort for sustainable development.</description>

      <title>A Portfolio of Building Solutions Supporting Positive Energy District Transition: Assessing the Impact of Green Building Certifications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su17020400</link>
      <description>Tiziana Ferrante, Paola Clerici Maestosi, Teresa Villani, Federica Romagnoli, Sustainability. 17(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406124138

                Positive Energy Districts (PEDs) represent an innovative approach to thinking and designing cities sustainably, in compliance with the European Union energy strategy. This strategy integrates sectors such as urban planning, energy, and construction to synergistically address energy and environmental challenges. Studies on sustainability assessment systems applied in PEDs evidenced that they focus mostly on energy aspects, while few include a comprehensive life cycle assessment of equivalent CO2 emissions, considering the building component and the impacts of the materials used. Additionally, most assessments are conducted on the urban and district scale, such as Neighborhood Sustainability Assessments (NSA), which begin to correlate PEDs with the dynamics of selecting sustainable materials for green-certified projects, analyzed throughout the entire life cycle, relying on the adoption of Green Building Rating Systems (GBRS) at the building scale. To explore the impact of environmentally friendly (i.e., &#8216;green&#8217;) GBRS certifications in the selection of building materials and products according to sustainability criteria, and to encourage their use in projects explicitly referring to PEDs, this study analyzes the technical solutions implemented in two significant residential building renovation projects in Italy from a PED perspective. It proposes a classification system based on the required targets of energy efficiency, energy production, and energy flexibility. The results include the definition of an expandable portfolio of technical solutions, an analytical comparison between the materials used in the energy renovation projects of the case studies examined, and the sustainability criteria provided by voluntary &#8217;green&#8217; certification tools (GBRS). The collected evidence offers an operational framework that confirms the positive impact of GBRS certifications and the related selection of materials on sustainable urban development, contributing to the scientific debate on PEDs. Furthermore, the use of voluntary &#8217;green&#8217; certifications at the building scale can be encouraged in the context of the transition towards PEDs, aiming to identify specific criteria and indicators for the selection of building materials to be integrated into future PED certifications. This aims to contribute to creating energy self-sufficient urban areas, focusing on sustainability, efficiency, and innovation, in line with global emission reduction and climate change mitigation goals.</description>

      <title>A New Look at Catalyst Surfaces at Work: Introducing Mixed Isotope Operando Infrared Spectroscopy (MIOIRS)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c06308</link>
      <description>Matteo Monai, ACS Catalysis. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406170106

                This Perspective focuses on the characterization of supported metal catalysts by operando and CO infrared (IR) spectroscopy. CO IR spectroscopy is a powerful technique for probing catalyst surfaces and is used to identify single-atom catalysts, estimate metal surface availability to the gas phase, and measure catalyst Lewis acidity. However, the interpretation of CO IR spectra on metal surfaces is not trivial and is influenced by dipole&#8211;dipole interactions among CO molecules at medium to high coverage. Such a phenomenon results in spectral distortions, such as intensity transfer among IR bands, the appearance of spurious bands, and shifts in band position. Dipole&#8211;dipole interactions were widely investigated and understood from the 1950s to 1990s, but the implications for operando spectroscopy have been seemingly overlooked in the literature, with a few exceptions. Inspired by seminal studies in the field, I propose here the use of mixed isotopic streams, such as diluted 13CO in 12CO, to reduce dipole coupling effects and retrieve more information from operando IR spectra in reactions involving CO, such as CO oxidation or hydrogenation reactions. Similarly, mixed 13CO2/12CO2 streams may be applied in CO2 hydrogenation, where adsorbed CO is commonly observed. The proposed name of the technique is Mixed Isotope Operando IR Spectroscopy, MIOIRS. In this Perspective, I will first summarize the nature of dipole&#8211;dipole interactions in adsorbed CO layers and their effects on CO IR spectra. Then, I will briefly describe how diluted isotopic mixtures of CO can partially break the coupling among adsorbates and reduce spectral distortion. In both sections, I will give a few showcases of the implications of vibrational coupling in the characterization of heterogeneous catalysts. Finally, I will discuss the possible implications of MIOIRS for the detection and quantification of defect and surface sites on metal nanoparticles, the characterization of bimetallic nanoparticles surfaces, and the kinetics of CO intermediates adsorbed on different active sites. Notably, MIOIRS may be expanded to other reactions in which adsorbates have strong permanent dipoles, such as in self-catalytic reduction for NOx abatement.</description>

      <title>Empowering quality education through sustainable and equitable electricity access in African schools</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joule.2024.12.005</link>
      <description>Magda Moner&#8208;Girona, Fernando Fahl, Georgia Kakoulaki, Dohyung Kim, Iyke Maduako, S. Szab&#243;, Godwell Nhamo, Benjamin K. Sovacool, Daniel J. Weiss, Joule. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406270132

                Context &amp; scaleAlthough most people born this century will be educated in African schools, these schools often lack basic infrastructure, such as electricity and/or lighting. In the face of a rapidly growing school-age population in Africa, the electrification of educational facilities is not just an infrastructural challenge but also a pivotal investment in the continent's future workforce. This study reveals a stark reality: a third of Africa's school-aged children are nearer to schools without electricity, impacting educational quality and access. By mapping over half a million schools across the continent, this research underscores the transformative potential of decentralized solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Not only could solar PV reduce travel times for millions of students, but it also promises the improvement of reliable services and a significant reduction in CO2 emissions. The strategic electrification of schools could catalyze a myriad of co-benefits, including enhancing educational outcomes, economic prosperity, and environmental sustainability. All this contributes to the achievement of multiple Sustainable Development Goals across the continent.Highlights&#8226;Comprehensive data of over half a million geolocated schools in Africa provided&#8226;PV systems offer clean, reliable, and cost-effective electricity access in schools&#8226;2 billion EUR investment needed to bring electricity to schools&#8226;Electricity can provide e-cooking, and internet services, and reduce travel time by 45 minSummaryAfrica's schools will educate the majority of the 21st century's working population, influencing the global economy. Through combined spatial analysis techniques on over 500,000 schools, we estimate a 2 billion EUR cost to power unelectrified schools with decentralized solar photovoltaic systems. Given the positive effect on children's food security and the growing need for digitalization, ensuring clean electricity access includes both electricity demand for internet connectivity and electric cooking. Our analysis reveals that 32% of African school-aged children live near unelectrified schools, with the nearest electrified school often too far away. The electrification of these facilities would reduce education-seeking trips by an average 45 min by motorized transport or 6 h on foot. This significant time savings, combined with the broader benefits of decentralized energy, can significantly enhance educational access, economic development, and environmental sustainability in Africa.Graphical abstract</description>

      <title>Advancements and Prospects in Personalized Navigation Systems for Knee Arthroplasty: A Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.37647/2786-7595-2024-122-3-32-40</link>
      <description>O.&#1052;. Sulyma, V.S. Chornyi, Ye.V. Kozik, TERRA ORTHOPAEDICA. None(3(122))] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406176191

                Introduction. Traditional methods of knee arthroplasty are based on mechanical alignment, which ensures long-term component survival but does not always meet patients&#8217; functional needs. Recent studies indicate that personalized alignment approaches, such as kinematic and functional alignment, can improve functional outcomes and reduce complication rates. These methods consider the natural axes of movement and the anatomy of the knee joint, contributing to the restoration of joint anatomy and function. Individualized navigation systems represent a modern approach to knee arthroplasty using three-dimensional preoperative models based on CT or MRI. This method improves the accuracy of fitting the prosthesis components, considering the patient&#8217;s individual anatomical features and biomechanical parameters. Objective. The objective of this literature review is to analyze the literature on using advanced navigation systems and evaluate their effectiveness, advantages, and prospects in personalizing knee joint arthroplasty. Material and Methods. Using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, we reviewed 22 scientific studies on various navigation systems for knee joint arthroplasty. Studies were selected based on patient numbers, statistical significance, clear inclusion and exclusion criteria, and availability of objective treatment outcome data. This allowed for a detailed analysis and comparison of different navigation methods. Results. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most effective surgical treatments for knee osteoarthritis. However, the accuracy of prosthesis implantation remains a critical factor for the long-term success of the surgery. Deviations in placement can lead to increased wear of components and a higher risk of complications. Traditionally, standard tools and techniques based on anatomical landmarks are used for prosthesis placement. In recent years, individualized navigation systems (INS) based on preoperative three-dimensional modeling of the patient&#8217;s individual anatomy have been introduced. INS aim to improve the accuracy of knee joint component placement, reduce time of surgery, and lower the risk of complications. Conclusions. The use of patient-specific surgical instruments and resection tools in primary and revision knee joint arthroplasty improves surgical and rehabilitation outcomes. This development allows for a 30% improvement in implant positioning accuracy and a 10% reduction in CO2 emissions. Standardizing research methods and increasing surgeon experience may contribute to a better understanding of the long-term benefits of individualized navigation systems in knee joint arthroplasty. Despite the identified advantages of INS, further research is needed to determine the long-term clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of these systems. The application of INS is especially important in cases of significant deformities and bone defects.</description>

Since the launch of the journal in 2016, we have built an enthusiastic energy community of authors, reviewers and readers. Their continued support has helped us to build a top-tier journal to disseminate new advances in energy research and discuss important scientific issues from the laboratory to the real world.We are pleased to engage with the passionate members of the scientific community who have made impressive progress in recent years to address clean energy challenges. The desire to reduce the carbon footprint has led to many innovative strategies to adopt renewable energy technologies. For example, perovskite solar cells, which showed an increase in efficiency from 14.1% in 2013 to 26.7% in 2024, are now being targeted for large-scale panel production. Si-perovskite-based tandem solar cells have made significant strides, reaching a record efficiency of 34.6%. Similarly, storage batteries have emerged from table-top devices to grid storage, and electrocatalysis is driving CO2 reduction on a pilot plant scale. The next phase of energy research is likely to be dominated with topics such as device stability of solar cells, display devices and electrolyzers, for long-term operation, fast charging of storage batteries, and recycling strategies for solar cells and storage batteries. Fundamental studies exploring properties of new materials for energy conversion and storage, and a better understanding of interfacial charge transfer processes in various devices (e.g., solar cells, storage batteries and LEDs), will also see a major growth in research.The growth of ACS Energy Letters during its first ten years can be seen from the increase in number of published articles as well as their growing impact (Figure 1). In addition to Letters, Perspectives and Reviews, we regularly publish Viewpoints and Energy Focus articles. These features offer our authors a unique opportunity to engage in scientific discussions. We also regularly feature Collections that compile key papers on an emerging topic. Each year, we also highlight contributions of women scientists along with their inspiring thoughts. Having anchored with these popular features during this early period, we plan to grow in the coming years by attracting new authors and readers.Figure 1Figure 1.
