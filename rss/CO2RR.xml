      <title>An Atomic&#8208;scale Explanation For The High Selectivity Towards Carbon Dioxide Reduction Observed On Liquid Metal Catalysts</title>

                The low&#8208;temperature liquid metals Ga&#8208;In and Ga&#8208;Sn have previously showcased &gt;95% selectivity towards the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate, occuring only when the alloys are melted, not solid. Here, density functional theory molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations reveal that CO2 does not directly adsorb to the Ga&#8208;alloy surface, but instead is reduced indirectly by reaction with an adsorbed hydrogen. The reaction barrier is vastly more favourable when this process occurs at In or Sn sites (average: 0.26 eV), than when it occurs on Ga (average: 0.47 eV). However, there is no difference in barrier between solid and liquid surfaces. Instead, we find that Hads is mobile only on the liquid surface, travelling due to the motion of the liquid beneath. This process drives Hads to In/Sn sites, allowing low&#8208;barrier CO2 reduction to occur only on the liquid. Therefore, the dynamic motion of liquid metal catalysts can underpin their unique reactivity. The result has far reaching implications for any protonation reaction conducted with a liquid metal catalyst.</description>

                Release of carbon dioxide (and other gases) into the atmosphere is becoming critical to climate change. Recent assessments not only have called for decarbonization of energy but for negative emissions; removals of carbon dioxide now in the atmosphere, in order to keep global warming to a sustainable level and control ocean acidification. The ocean is currently by far the major sink for carbon dioxide emissions and artificially enhancing these existing processes provides opportunities for substantial sequestration. These opportunities not only can help mitigate climate change but may provide new markets for various sectors of the marine industry.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Heat Treatment on the Photoactivity of Amine-Modified Titanium Dioxide in the Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>

                Modification of titanium dioxide using ethylenediamine (EDA), diethylamine (DEA), and triethylamine (TEA) has been studied. As the reference material, titanium dioxide prepared by the sol&#8211;gel method using titanium(IV) isopropoxide as a precursor was applied. The preparation procedure involved heat treatment in the microwave reactor or in the high-temperature furnace. The obtained samples have been characterized in detail. The phase composition was determined through the X-ray diffraction method, and the average crystallite size was calculated based on it. Values for specific surface areas and the total pore volumes were calculated based on the isotherms obtained through the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption method. The bang gap energy was estimated based on Tauc&#8217;s plots. The influence of the type and content of amine, as well as heat treatment on the photocatalytic activity of modified titanium dioxide in the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide, was determined and discussed. It was clear that, regardless of the amount and content of amine introduced, the higher photoactivity characterized the samples prepared in the microwave reactor. The highest amounts of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane have been achieved using triethylamine-modified titanium dioxide.</description>

                The conversion of CO2 into valuable chemical fuels addresses both environmental pollution and energy scarcity. However, understanding reaction mechanisms and the dynamic catalyst evolution during CO2 reduction remains a challenge to data. In this review, we present a detailed description of recent advanced in situ characterization techniques, which provide a reliable means of monitoring the intermediate evolution during CO2 reduction and the dynamic evolution of the catalyst, respectively. Finally, we provide an outlook on the development of in situ characterization techniques.</description>

      <title>Size and Morphology Dependent Activity of Cu Clusters for CO2 Activation and Reduction: A First Principles Investigation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cphc.202400442</link>
      <description>Shahid Amin, Sa&#239;laja Krishnamurty, Manzoor Ahmad Dar, Krati Joshi, ChemPhysChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402499862

                Various Cu&#8208;based materials in diverse forms have been investigated as efficient catalysts for electrochemical reduction of CO2; however, they suffer from issues such as higher over potential and poor selectivity. The activity and selectivity of CO2 electro reduction have been shown to change significantly when the surface morphology (steps, kinks, and edges) of these catalysts is altered. In light of this, size and morphology dependent activity of selected copper clusters, Cun (n=2&#8208;20) have been evaluated for the activation and reduction of CO2 molecule. The phase&#8208;space of these copper clusters is rich in conformations of distinct morphologies starting from planar, 2D geometries to prolate&#8208;shaped geometries and also high&#8208;symmetry structures. The binding efficiency and the activation of CO2 are highest for medium sized clusters (n=9&#8208;17) with prolate&#8208;morphologies as compared to small or larger sized CunCO2 clusters that are existing mainly as planar (triangular, tetragonal etc.) or highly&#8208;symmetric geometries (icosahedron, capped&#8208;icosahedron etc.), respectively. The best performing (prolate&#8208;shaped) CunCO2 conformations are quite fluxional and also they are thermally stable, as demonstrated by the molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, on these CunCO2 conformations, the step&#8208;by&#8208;step hydrogenation pathways of CO2 to produce value&#8208;added products like methanol, formic acid, and methane are exceptionally favorable and energy&#8208;efficient.</description>

      <title>Reduction Polymerization of CO2 with Phenylene Silanes Cata&#8208;lyzed by Single Component B(C6F5)3</title>

                CO2 is an abundant C1 resource but a green&#8208;house gas and chemically inert. Thus, its utilization has been a promising but challenging project. Herein, we report the unprecedented polymerization of CO2 and C6H4(SiMe2H)2 using B(C6F5)3 alone under mild conditions to give poly(silphenylene siloxane) accompanied by releasing CH4. The copolymerization can be extended to comonomers of phenylene silanes bearing functional groups. Moreover, it combines with Piers&#8208;Rubinsztajn reaction to establish a tandem polymerization system to achieve super thermal resistant poly(siloxane&#8208;co&#8208;silphenylene siloxane)s. Density functional theory reveals that B(C6F5)3 is activated by silanes to form free HB(C6F5)2, which is the true active species for CO2 reducing to borylformate, the rate controlling step of the polymerization procedure. The subsequent multiple reductions of borylformate to CH4 and the step&#8208;growth to poly(silphenylene siloxane)s can be fulfilled by both B(C6F5)3 and HB(C6F5)2, and the former shows a slightly higher activity. This work opens a new avenue of utilizing CO2 to fabricate polysiloxanes that is unable to access using current manners.</description>

      <title>Cu(I)&#8208;Induced &#8216;Click Reaction&#8217; Involving Coordination and Covalent Assembly of Hybrid Borates for the Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202412073</link>

                The design and synthesis of hybrid borates by the organic ligand modification method are urgent and undeveloped areas of research. It is difficult to directly integrate organoboronic acids within inorganic borate chemistry by adopting the traditional preparation approaches. This work reports a facile synthetic method to synthesize a large family of pyrazole molecule&#8208;protected borates in a rapid and precise manner under mild conditions. A unique cyclic eight&#8208;membered B4O4&#8208;ring has been identified as the cluster core for all these hybrid borates with two different conformations (boat and crown). This strategy can be applied to a system of pyrazolyl molecules to generate such hybrid borates in two independent routes from organoboronic or inorganic boric acids. Furtherly, the mechanism of &#8216;click reaction&#8217; between boric acid and pyrazole induced by copper ions has been proposed based on the synthetic conditions and the structure of intermediate. Due to the bimetallic Cu sites and the functional surfaces, these materials can be used as electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction and efficiently enhance the selectivity of HCOOH and C2H4. Our strategy can be regarded as a typical template technique for organic molecule&#8208;protected borates.</description>

                The cement industry has significant environmental impacts, stemming from natural resources extraction and fossil fuels combustion. Notably, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are a major concern associated with cement production. The cement industry emits 0.6 tons of CO2 per ton of cement production, which is around 8 % of the total CO2 emissions in the world. Meeting the 13th United Nations Sustainable Goals, cement plants aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, resulting from reduction in CO2 emissions (change in the composition of cementitious materials) and the adoption of carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technologies. A promising approach involves converting CO&#8322; into valuable chemicals and fuels, such as methanol (MeOH) through the power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies. In this process, CO2 captured from cement industry flue gas with hydrogen generated from renewable sources through electrolysis of water, catalytically transformed into renewable methanol (e-MeOH), offering a sustainable solution. To achieve this, it is crucial to advance the development of novel, highly efficient catalysts specifically designed for direct CO2 hydrogenation. In this sense, this review discusses recent developments and improvements in CO2 catalytic conversion, emphasizing catalyst performance, selectivity, and stability.</description>

      <title>The importance of an informed choice of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalence metrics for contrail avoidance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-9401-2024</link>
      <description>Audran Borella, Olivi&#233;r Boucher, Keith P. Shine, Marc Stettler, Katsumasa Tanaka, Roger Teoh, Nicolas Bellouin, Atmospheric chemistry and physics. 24(16)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402552629

                Abstract. One of the proposed ways to reduce the climate impact of civil aviation is rerouting aircraft to minimise the formation of warming contrails. As this strategy may increase fuel consumption, it would only be beneficial if the climate impact reduction from the avoided contrails exceeds the negative impact of any additional carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by the rerouted flight. In this study, we calculate the surface temperature response of almost half a million flights that crossed the North Atlantic sector in 2019 and compare it to the temperature response of hypothetical rerouted flights. The climate impacts of contrails and CO2 are assessed through the perspective of CO2-equivalence metrics, represented here as nine combinations of different definitions and time horizons. We estimate that the total emitted CO2 and the persistent contrails formed will have warmed the climate by 17.2 &#181;K in 2039, 13.7 &#181;K in 2069, and 14.1 &#181;K in 2119. Under an idealised scenario where 1 % additional carbon dioxide is enough to reroute all contrail-forming flights and avoid contrail formation completely, total warming would decrease by 4.9 (&#8722;28 %), 2.6 (&#8722;19 %), and 1.9 (&#8722;13 %) &#181;K in 2039, 2069, and 2119, respectively. In most rerouting cases, the results based on the nine different CO2-equivalence metrics agree that rerouting leads to a climate benefit, assuming that contrails are avoided as predicted. But the size of that benefit is very dependent on the choice of CO2-equivalence metrics, contrail efficacy and CO2 penalty. Sources of uncertainty not considered here could also heavily influence the perceived benefit. In about 10 % of rerouting cases, the climate damage resulting from contrail avoidance indicated by CO2-equivalence metrics integrated over a 100-year time horizon is not predicted by metrics integrated over a 20-year time horizon. This study highlights, using North Atlantic flights as a case study, the implications of the choice of CO2-equivalence metrics for contrail avoidance, but the choice of metric implies a focus on a specific climate objective, which is ultimately a political decision.</description>

                Emission reduction through after treatment processes has become one of the options to minimize the adverse effects of two-wheeler emissions. Activated charcoal adsorbents have been proven effective in reducing emissions to a certain extent. In this study, corn cob charcoal activated with a 15% NaCl solution serves as the adsorbent. The adsorbent used is shaped into particles with a mesh size of 10. The adsorbent is placed in the modified motorcycle muffler. Testing is conducted on two-wheeled vehicles operated using the dual-fuel method, where biogas and pertalite are used as fuels. With this method, fuel concentrations are obtained significantly smaller compared to vehicles without emission reduction methods. Testing is carried out for 2 hours to determine the durability of the adsorbent in absorbing exhaust gas emissions. Based on the test results, where data collection is conducted every 10 minutes, the concentrations of emissions including hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2) initially decrease and then rise again after several minutes. This indicates that the adsorbent effectively reduces emissions in a relatively short duration. However, the effectiveness of corn cob activated charcoal in reducing these three emissions varies, with the adsorbent showing good performance in reducing HC</description>

                The key towards a sustainable future is the reduction of mankind&amp;rsquo;s impact on natural systems via the development of new technologies and the improvement of source apportionment. Though days, years and seasons are arbitrarily set, their mechanisms are based on natural cycles driven by Earth&amp;rsquo;s orbital periods. This is not the case for weeks, which are a pure anthropic category and are known from literature to influence emission cycles. For the first time since it started data gathering operations, CO (carbon monoxide), CO2 (carbon dioxide), CH4 (methane) and eBC (equivalent black carbon) values detected by the Lamezia Terme WMO/GAW station in Calabria, Southern Italy have been evaluated via a two-pronged approach accounting for weekly variations in absolute concentrations, as well as the number of hourly averages exceeding select thresholds. The analyses were performed on seven continuous years of measurements, from 2016 to 2022. Moreso, the two results have been combined into a new parameter: the hereby defined WDWO (Weighed Distribution of Weekly Outbreaks) normalizes weekly trends of CO, CO2, CH4 and eBC on an absolute scale as percentages, with the scope of providing regulators and researchers alike with a new tool meant to better evaluate anthropogenic pollution and mitigate its effects.</description>

      <title>Implementation of a Management System to Mitigate Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Light Vehicles Transportation Through Improved Driving Behavior in the State of Kuwait</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/220345-ms</link>
      <description>B. M. Al-Hadhrami, No host. 133(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402397577

                Abstract This study investigates the effects of improved driving behaviors on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction from light vehicles in Kuwait. There has been a steady increase in Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emission to the atmosphere globally since the industrial revolution. Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, transportation, and changes in land use are major contributors to the increase in concentrations of atmospheric GHGs. According to the latest estimates, Kuwait being a major oil producing country, annual increase in GHG emissions has been recorded for the past two decades, with 21.2 MT per capita emitted in 2020, increased from 21.1 compared to 2019. Implementing practical and feasible reduction strategies to the significant emission contributors is essential. This study proposes a management system targeting the transportation sector through enhanced driving behaviors in a transportation fleet, using a monitoring hardware and software, to collect data from 25 light vehicles. To assess the solution's effectiveness, we compared pre- and post-intervention periods of fuel consumption in light vehicles through monitoring and enhancing the driving behavior variables, harsh acceleration, harsh braking, over-speeding, and idling, thus reducing carbon emissions that was determined based on the US EPA conversion factor. Our results show significant improvements in several key parameters, a 15% reduction in fuel consumption resulting in 15% and 18% carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) and cost reduction, respectively. This should represent huge environmental and economic benefit associated with the measures implemented. In the post-intervention phase, where controls and interventions were implemented to enhance drivers' behaviors, there was a significant reduction in idling hours, decreasing by 8,167.38 hours with a (P &amp;lt; 0.003). These results clearly illustrate the need for more stringent national regulations at improving driving behaviors, which not only contribute to environmental quality improvement but also offer substantial economic advantages.</description>

      <title>The role of gallium nitride in the evolution of electric vehicles: Energy applications, technology, and challenges</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0215799</link>
      <description>Kazi Faridur Rahman, Shaili Falina, Mohamed Fauzi Packeer Mohamed, Hiroshi Kawarada, Mohd Syamsul, Applied Physics Reviews. 11(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402456843

                It is only recently that the electric vehicle (EV) has evolved into a contemporary invention. There has been a rapid acceleration in the development of EVs in a number of nations in order to lessen their reliance on oil and their contribution to environmental pollution. In the tangible world, fully EVs do not release any carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from their tailpipes, unlike any other conventional vehicles. This results in a 50%&#8211;70% CO2 reduction in air pollution per year. The achievement of electrification in transportation has led to a reduction in the weight and size of the vehicles as the need for internal combustion engines can be eliminated. Wide bandgap materials such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) offer advantages in the manufacturing of EVs. Beginning the late 2000s, the EV industry has begun to adopt GaN devices in their manufacturing processes. The semiconductor material GaN stands out as a material for power electronic systems in EVs owing to its high switching frequency, higher temperature limit, and high voltage breakdown. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of semiconductor GaN materials for EV applications, which could be useful to provide insights for researchers and scientists to accelerate their innovation for the improvement of EVs. This review begins with an introduction to EVs, followed by the anticipated demand for EVs. The application of GaN devices in EVs, compared to the traditional Si and SiC devices, which are the primary power devices in current EVs, is discussed. The recent advancement in GaN devices that are capable of being used in various components of a fully automated EV, such as the battery, energy storage system, auxiliary power unit, and motor drive, in addition to their use in different non-automotive vehicles such as electric aircraft, electric ships, electric railways, electric submarines, and heavy duty vehicles, is also discussed. Finally, the challenges posed by GaN devices and potential solutions to overcome these shortcomings have been addressed.</description>

      <title>PSV-14 The effects of calcium cyanamide on greenhouse gases, ammonia emissions, and the microbiome of dairy cattle lagoon water</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skae234.585</link>
      <description>Alice S. Rocha, Bryan Morales, Hamed M. El&#8208;Mashad, Yuee Pan, Yongjing Zhao, Frank M. Mitloehner, Journal of Animal Science. 102(Supplement_3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402533394

                Abstract Dairy manure management is responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in California. Aside from redesigning infrastructure to adopt alternative manure management systems, there are few options available to farmers to mitigate emissions without substantial financial investment. Calcium cyanamide, a new manure additive, showed significant reductions in GHG emissions when applied to fresh dairy cow slurry, but has not been tested on dairy lagoon water. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of calcium cyanamide on GHG and NH3 emissions and the microbiome of dairy lagoon water. Lagoon water was collected from a commercial dairy, and distributed into 12 stainless steel barrels. Three treatments (n = 4/treatment) of different doses of calcium cyanamide were tested: high (LW-HD; 1 kg/m3 lagoon water), low (LW-LD; 0.5 kg/m3 lagoon water), and control with no calcium cyanamide (LW-CONT; n = 4). Each barrel was sampled over two, 14-d periods, staggered to four barrels at a time, using OdoFlux chambers to monitor emissions for carbon dioxide (CO2,), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ammonia (NH3). Treatments LW-LD and LW-HD contained significantly more total solids, total nitrogen and total carbon compared with LW-CONT. There was also a significantly greater concentration of acetic acid in LW-LD and LW-HD treatments compared with LW-CONT. CO2 emissions in LW-LD and LW-HD were 2.96% and 12.03% less than LW-CONT. CH4 emissions in LW-LD and LW-HD were 80.9% and 85.13% less compared with LW-CONT. N2O emissions in LW-LD and LW-HD were 81.1% and 82.66% less than LW-CONT. However, NH3 fluxes were greater in LW-LD and LW-HD compared with LW-CONT by 65.26% and 65.73%, respectively. The microbiome of the lagoon water was also affected, with reductions in relative abundance of the Proteobacteria phylum responsible for nitrification in LW-LD and LW-HD and increases in the Firmicutes phylum containing acetogenic bacteria. Calcium cyanamide could inhibit methanogenesis by increasing acetogenic bacteria that compete with methanogens for fermentation substrates. Further research is needed to investigate the efficacy of calcium cyanamide in a commercial lagoon setting.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control of Ships&#8217; Oil-Fired Boilers Using Flame Image-Based IMC-PID and Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse12091603</link>
      <description>Chang-Min Lee, Byung-Gun Jung, Journal of Marine Science and Engineering. 12(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402412729

                The control system of oil-fired boiler units on ships plays a crucial role in reducing the emissions of atmospheric pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxides (SO2), and carbon dioxide (CO2). Traditional control methods using conventional measurement sensors face limitations in real-time control due to response delays, which has led to the growing interest in combustion control methods using flame images. To ensure the precision of such combustion control systems, the system model must be thoroughly considered during controller design. However, finding the optimal tuning point is challenging due to the changes in the system model and nonlinearity caused by environmental variations. This study proposes a controller that integrates an internal model control (IMC)-based PID controller with the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm of deep reinforcement learning to enhance the adaptability of image-based combustion control systems to environmental changes. The proposed controller adjusts the PID parameter values in real-time through the learning of the determination constant lambda (&#955;) of the IMC internal model. This approach reduces computational resources by shrinking the learning dimensions of the DDPG agent and limits transient responses through constrained learning of control parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed controller exhibited rapid adaptive performance in the learning process for the target oxygen concentration, achieving a reward value of &#8722;0.05 within just 105 episodes. Furthermore, when compared to traditional PID tuning methods, the proposed controller demonstrated superior performance, achieving a target value error of 0.0032 and a low overshoot range of 0.0498 to 0.0631, providing the fastest response speed and minimal oscillation. Additionally, experiments conducted on an actual operating ship verified the practical feasibility of this system, highlighting its potential for real-time control and pollutant reduction in marine applications.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Environmental and Economic Assessment of Low-Carbon Energy Sources</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.15826/vestnik.2024.23.3.028</link>
      <description>Dmitry Dvinin, Alexey Yu. Davankov, Journal of Applied Economic Research. 23(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402395000

                The article presents the results of a study of various low-carbon energy sources based on a multi-criteria analysis for the purpose of a comprehensive environmental and economic assessment of the effectiveness of their use. The peculiarity of the study is that it analyzed both renewable energy sources and traditional fossil fuel based ones using innovative technologies for carbon dioxide capture and storage, as well as nuclear energy. The purpose of this work is to conduct a comprehensive assessment based on three criteria: normalized cost of electricity LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy)/LEC (Levelized Energy Cost), specific value of carbon dioxide emissions and material intensity expressed in total MI (Material Input) numbers. The hypothesis of the study is as follows: the introduction of the criterion of material intensity in MI numbers into a comprehensive assessment will allow one to identify low-carbon energy sources with the greatest ecological and economic effect. As a result, it was found that in 2023, the global energy capacity of low-carbon energy sources reached 51.8%, but the share of energy produced by them is significantly lower, amounting to only 39.4%. The multi-criteria analysis made it possible to identify low-carbon energy sources that, at the lowest cost, provide the greatest reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and at the same time reduce the overall environmental impact by reducing the disturbance of biospheric material flows. Wind farms have high ecological and economic efficiency, while solar energy sources and bioelectric power plants &#8211; slightly less so. Geothermal and hydroelectric power plants have a low normalized cost of electricity, but they have relatively high values of material intensity. The environmental and economic efficiency of nuclear power is higher than that of gas and coal-fired power plants using carbon dioxide capture technologies; it occupies an intermediate position between renewable and traditional energy sources. An unexpected established fact is that gas and coal-fired power plants with carbon dioxide capture technologies have the same environmental and economic efficiency. The results obtained can be useful in making decisions about the possibility of prioritizing the development of individual low-carbon energy sources.</description>

                As global climate change intensifies, countries face serious challenges. In response to this issue, various industries are actively promoting green development and energy conservation measures, with the electricity sector being particularly important. As a major emitter of carbon dioxide, China&#8217;s construction of transmission infrastructure has a significant impact on global climate change. In this context, research on energy conservation and emission reduction measures is urgently needed. Taking the 500 kV transmission project in Jiande, Zhejiang Province as an example, this study analyzes its carbon emissions in detail and quantifies the effects of 18 energy conservation and emission reduction measures. The results show that adopting energy conservation and emission reduction technologies can significantly reduce carbon emissions, especially in terms of raw materials and equipment. However, there are still issues such as data gaps and unclear quantification methods that need further research and improvement. Therefore, it is recommended to continue researching energy conservation and emission reduction technologies, establish relevant standards, and promote the development of more environmentally friendly raw materials and equipment by power enterprises to facilitate the green and low-carbon development of transmission engineering.</description>

                This paper addresses the potential of integrating a concentrating photovoltaic thermal (CPV/T) system with an absorption chiller for the purpose of space cooling in residential buildings in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The proposed system consists of a low concentrating photovoltaic thermal (CPV/T) collector that utilizes mono-crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells integrated with a single-effect absorption chiller. The integrated system was modeled using the Transient System Simulation (TRNSYS v17) software. The obtained model was implemented in a case study represented by a villa situated in Abu Dhabi having a peak cooling load of 366 kW. The hybrid system was proposed to have a contribution of 60% renewable energy and 40% conventional nonrenewable energy. A feasibility study was carried out that demonstrated that the system could save approximately 670,700 kWh annually and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 461 tons per year. The reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is equivalent of removing approximately 98 cars off the road. The payback period for the system was estimated to be 3.12 years.</description>

      <title>Decarbonisation Innovation Approach to Address Global Methane Pledge</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/220323-ms</link>
      <description>Fatima AlRaeesi, D. Bandopadhyay, S. AlMazrouie, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402426351

                Abstract Aligned with UAE&#8217;s Net Zero Pledge and ADNOC&#8217;s Sustainability Targets 2030, ADNOC Gas has developed a robust decarbonization roadmap to accomplish 25%+ GHG emission reduction by 2030 compared to baseline year of 2019, through Innovation and technological interventions. In addition, ADNOC has endorsed the "Oil &amp; Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP 2.0)", undertaking methane monitoring from all its sources and taking actions to reduce methane emissions, a key contributor to overall GHG emissions. Towards its commitment to achieve zero methane emission by 2030, ADNOC Gas has implemented state-of-the-art flare.IQ technology, an Advance Process Control (APC) application to optimize flare operations, demonstrating real-time improvement in the combustion efficiency and steam/fuel savings, thereby reducing methane and overall GHG emissions. The paper explains how Baker Hughes arrived at its flare.IQ solution. Having developed the flare.IQ solution, the paper will go on to describe how complex its technology works. In short, using an advanced analytics platform, operators can pull critical information about their flare system, including temperature, pressure, vent gas velocities and gas composition to calculate the optimum levels of flare performance and ensure 98%+ high-efficiency flare combustion. To address this challenge and in line with ADNOC commitment towards Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 Gold Standard, ADNOC Gas, in partnership with M/s Baker Hughes, introduced a state-of-the-art flare.IQ technology, an integrated hardware, software, and service solution for the management of flare gas. It functions as an Advanced Process Controller taking flare conditions (flow, temperature, pressure, BTU) as inputs, calculating against a model and outputs set points to the Distributed Control System (DCS) for air assist flow rate and fuel gas flow rate to achieve required destruction efficiency of the flare system. This control-based solution significantly improves flare combustion efficiency, reduces the cover gas consumption, and provides smokeless flaring. ADNOC Gas successfully implemented the flare.IQ technology in one of its facilities to optimize flare operations, monitor and reduce emissions in real time resulting in smokeless flaring and operational savings. Flare.IQ Technology supports ADNOC Digitalization, having its solution development, the complex technology works using an advanced analytics platform where operators can pull critical information about their flare system including temperature, pressure, vent gas. The key benefits of the flare.IQ Technology include: Optimizing the combustion efficiency to Combustion Efficiency (CE)% &amp;gt;98% in assisted flares Methane (CH4) Emission quantification and reduction in compliance to OGMP 2.0 Level 4 monitoring Improve overall flare operational efficiency by optimizing steam and fuel consumption resulting in savings. Achieve smokeless flare operation when operated in cascade mode. Real-time monitoring of combustion efficiency, Net Heating Value (NHV), Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (CO2eq), Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). Replace static emissions factors with real-time CE / DRE measurement. Identify issues early and intervene quickly by having access to real-time combustion efficiency data on the production floor. Methane emission is one of the most critical focus areas to combat climate change and are a prevalent talking point in the public domain. Flare.IQ is an emerging solution that is easy to deploy, cost effective and is being rapidly deployed by the industry. With the oil and gas industry keen to raise awareness of its response to combatting emissions, flare.IQ is a largely untold positive story. Methane is a major greenhouse gas with a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 27-30 over 100 years. Oil and Gas sector is responsible for around +30% of global methane emissions and poses huge challenge to limit these emissions towards the global battle against climate change [2]. At ADNOC, unburnt combustion in the flares contributes more than 50% of total methane emissions. Further, uncontrolled consumption of cover gas or steam (high fuel consumption) in association with flaring leads to higher GHG emissions. Accordingly, ADNOC is striving to leverage innovation and technological interventions to address this challenge.</description>

      <title>The interaction between China&#8217;s economic recovery and environmental governance: a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and resource management</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1459483</link>
      <description>Yuting Duan, Frontiers in Environmental Science. 12(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402529246

                To gain a deeper understanding of the intrinsic dynamic relationship between energy consumption and economic growth in China. This study employs panel cointegration and causality models, utilizing the SYS-GMM technique to assess the factors influencing economic growth in China&#8217;s green finance sector from 2002 to 2022. The research explores the interactions among multiple variables related to the Chinese economic context, including economic growth, carbon dioxide emissions, total natural resource rents, energy consumption, and environmental impact. While considering key factors that may cause structural disturbances in the time series analysis. The findings indicate the existence of long-term cointegration relationships among these variables, with positive correlations between economic growth and total natural resource rents, energy consumption, energy quantity, and ecological footprint. Results also show a bidirectional causal relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption and a unidirectional correlation between energy consumption and GDP growth. Additionally, energy intensity (EI) improvements supported by green finance are linked to a significant reduction in CO 2 emissions, with a coefficient of &#8722;1.933 ( p &amp;lt; 0.05), underscoring the role of technological innovation. Further evaluations suggest that investments in renewable energy can promote economic growth, create job opportunities, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Energy-saving measures and green finance-supported technological innovations play crucial roles in improving energy intensity and reducing CO 2 emissions. The study also underscores the importance of economic diversification to reduce dependence on natural resources and enhance economic stability. Future research should further explore the economic feasibility and environmental benefits of emerging technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), providing deeper insights into sustainable energy practices.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Hydrazine Alternatives to Water Treatment in Power Plants: Effects of Hydrazine Alternatives and Decomposition Products on Water Properties and Corrosion of Carbon Steel</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5006/4621</link>
      <description>Noriyuki Ida, Junichi Tani, Hirotaka Kawamura, CORROSION. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402517306

                ABSTRACT The applicability of carbohydrazide (CHZ) and diethylhydroxilamine (DEHA) as hydrazine alternatives to the water treatment of water-steam circuits of power plants was investigated by assessing their effects on the corrosion of carbon steel and water properties, including the conductivity, conductivity after cation exchange (cation conductivity), dissolved-oxygen concentration (DO), and oxidation&#8211;reduction potential (ORP) of high-temperature water under simulated conditions of boiler feed water of power plants. Hydrazine and carbon dioxide were generated by CHZ decomposition, resulting in a decrease in DO and increases in both conductivity and cation conductivity. Various substances including diethylamine, ethylamine, and acetaldehyde were generated by DEHA decomposition, and the amines increased conductivity. Under the oxygen-containing condition, acetate was also formed, and cation conductivity was increased by DEHA injection. Measurements of DO and ORP suggested that high CHZ and DEHA concentrations or temperatures were required for them to exert their oxygen-scavenging effect and decrease the electrode potential of metals like hydrazine. Irrespective of the decomposition products of CHZ or DEHA, neither of these hydrazine alternatives accelerated the corrosion of carbon steel. In this study, various characteristics of CHZ and DEHA were clarified, and results suggest that CHZ is a safe choice, as long as hydrazine generation by CHZ decomposition does not conflict with hydrazine restriction.</description>

                The US Pulp and Paper (P&amp;P) industry heavily relies on fossil sources, with lime kiln operations posing a significant challenge for achieving zero on-site fossil emissions. This study assesses the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential and costs associated with alternative fuels in lime kiln operations for linerboard production. Various options, including bio-based fuels including pulverized biomass, gasification of biomass, crude tall oil, bio-methanol, and traditional fuels such as fuel oil and petcoke, were analyzed through detailed process simulations and Life Cycle Assessment. Results indicate that per ton of product, 2,789 kg of CO2-eq is emitted, with 69% being biogenic CO2 and 31% fossil CO2-eq. Notably, replacing the natural gas boiler with a biomass boiler reduces Global Warming Potential (GWP) by 41%, while switching lime kiln fuel to biofuels achieves a 5.5% reduction. Combining a biomass boiler with pulverized biomass fuel use in the lime kiln yields a substantial 93.1% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions, at a cost of $76/ton of CO2-eq avoided.</description>

                Abstract Coupling carbon capture with electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 R) to yield high&#8208;value chemicals presents an appealing avenue for combating climate change, yet achieving highly selective electrocatalysts remains a significant challenge. Herein, two molecularly woven covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are designed, namely CuCOF and CuCOF + , with copper(I)&#8208;bisphenanthroline complexes as building blocks. The metal&#8211;organic helical structure unit made the CuCOF and CuCOF + present woven patterns, and their ordered pore structures and cationic properties enhanced their CO 2 adsorption and good conductivity, which is confirmed by gas adsorption and electrochemical analysis. In the electrocatalytic CO 2 R measurements, CuCOF + decorated with extra ethyl groups exhibit a main CO product with selectivity of 57.81%, outperforming the CuCOF with 42.92% CO at the same applied potential of 0.8 V RHE . After loading Pd nanoparticles, CuCOF&#8208;Pd and CuCOF + &#8208;Pd performed increased CO selectivity up to 84.97% and 95.45%, respectively. Combining the DFT theoretical calculations and experimental measurements, it is assumed that the molecularly woven cationic COF provides a catalytic microenvironment for CO 2 R and ensures efficient charge transfer from the electrode to the catalytic center, thereby achieving high electrocatalytic activity and selectivity. The present work significantly advances the practice of cationic COFs in real&#8208;time CO 2 capture and highly selective conversion to value&#8208;added chemicals.</description>

      <title>Unanticipated evolution of cardio-respiratory interactions with cognitive load during a Go-NoGo shooting task in virtual reality</title>

                The cardiovascular system interacts continuously with the respiratory system to maintain the vital balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in our body. The interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system regulates the aforesaid involuntary functions. This study analyzes the dynamics of the cardio-respiratory (CR) interactions using RR Intervals (RRI), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), and Respiration signals after first-order differencing to make them stationary. It investigates their variation with cognitive load induced by a virtual reality (VR) based Go-NoGo shooting task with low and high levels of task difficulty. We use Pearson's correlation-based linear and mutual information-based nonlinear measures of association to indicate the reduction in RRI-SBP and RRI-Respiration interactions with cognitive load. However, no linear correlation difference was observed in SBP-Respiration interactions with cognitive load, but their mutual information increased. A couple of open-loop autoregressive models with exogenous input (ARX) are estimated using RRI and SBP, and one closed-loop ARX model is estimated using RRI, SBP, and Respiration. The impulse responses (IRs) are derived for each input-output pair, and a reduction in the positive and negative peak amplitude of all the IRs is observed with cognitive load. Some novel parameters are derived by representing the IR as a double exponential curve with cosine modulation and show significant differences with cognitive load compared to other measures, especially for the IR between SBP and Respiration.</description>

      <title>l-Lactate dehydrogenase from Cyanidioschyzon merolae shows high catalytic efficiency for pyruvate reduction and is inhibited by ATP</title>

                Abstract l -Lactate is a commodity chemical used in various fields. Microorganisms have produced l -lactate via lactic fermentation using saccharides derived from crops as carbon sources. Recently, l -lactate production using microalgae, whose carbon source is carbon dioxide, has been spotlighted because the prices of the crops have increased. A red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae produce l -lactate via lactic fermentation under dark anaerobic conditions. The l -lactate titer of C. merolae is higher than those of other microalgae but lower than those of heterotrophic bacteria. Therefore, an increase in the l -lactate titer is required in C. merolae . l -Lactate dehydrogenase ( l -LDH) catalyzes the reduction of pyruvate to l -lactate during lactic fermentation. C. merolae possesses five isozymes of l -LDH. The results of previous transcriptome analysis suggested that l -LDHs are the key enzymes in the lactic fermentation of C. merolae . However, their biochemical characteristics, such as catalytic efficiency and tolerance for metabolites, have not been revealed. We compared the amino acid sequences of C. merolae l -LDHs ( Cm LDHs) and characterized one of the isozymes, Cm LDH1. BLAST analysis revealed that the sequence similarities of Cm LDH1 and the other isozymes were above 99%. The catalytic efficiency of Cm LDH1 under its optimum conditions was higher than those of l -LDHs of other organisms. ATP decreased the affinity and turnover number of Cm LDH1 for NADH. These findings contribute to understanding the characteristics of l -LDHs of microalgae and the regulatory mechanisms of lactic fermentation in C. merolae .</description>

      <title>The Effect of Fly Ash Additive on the Thermal Conductivity of Polystyrene Concrete</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14092850</link>
      <description>Rassul B. Tlegenov, Rimma Niyazbekova, Assel Jexembayeva, Kinga Korniejenko, Lyazat Aruova, Saule Aldabergenova, Aslan S. Maykonov, Buildings. 14(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402395411

                The use of fly ash in compositions as a substitute for a part of cement is economically favorable and ecologically feasible in connection with large accumulations of waste at the enterprises of the energy sector. In addition, the technology of cement production provides high-temperature treatment of mineral substances in kilns with significant emissions of carbon dioxide. One of the most effective directions of the utilization of fly ash is their use in concrete composites. The use of this material will provide the required temperature and humidity conditions in residential premises, solve the problem of &#8220;cold bridges&#8221; in structures, minimize heat losses of the structure, and increase the energy efficiency of buildings in general. At the same time, polystyrene concrete, due to its structural structure and the presence of thermally conductive concrete, has limited opportunities for thermal and physical&#8211;mechanical properties. To improve the operational properties of polystyrene concrete, it is proposed to use composite binders, including fly ash from the thermal power station of Astana. The main aim of this study is to develop compositions of polystyrene concrete with reduced thermal conductivity and improved physical and mechanical properties. The objectives of this study include the determination of characteristics of fly ash from Astana, formulation of polystyrene concrete mixtures with different proportions of fly ash, and evaluation of their thermal conductivity properties. These tasks are in line with the objectives of the ISO 50001 standard to improve energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact. The results showed that the addition of fly ash from Astana to polystyrene concrete leads to a marked reduction in thermal conductivity, contributing to improved energy efficiency of the building envelope. Optimal results were achieved by using 15% of Astana fly ash as an additive in polystyrene concrete, which led to a significant reduction in thermal conductivity of 51.47%. This reduction is in line with improving the energy efficiency of building materials, especially in cold climates.</description>

      <title>Life Cycle Assessment of Crude Oil-Contaminated Soil Treated by Low-Temperature Thermal Desorption and Its Beneficial Reuse for Soil Amendment</title>

                The LTTD process for highly concentrated crude oil-contaminated soil was studied to evaluate the remediation efficiency. In addition, the environmental impact difference between HTTD and LTTD was studied. OpenLCA software obtained from PE International was used to perform the analyses. The total ADP environmental impact of the HTTD process was 1.63E-04 MJ, whereas the total GWP impact was 4.14E+02 kg CO2-eq. In contrast, the LTTD process exhibits total ADP and GWP environmental impacts of 1.29E-04 MJ and 2.78E+02 kg CO2 eq, respectively. Analysis of the overall environmental impact reduction revealed that replacing the HTTD process with the LTTD process resulted in a total ADP reduction of 3.40E-05 MJ (20.5%) and a GWP reduction of 1.36E+02 kg CO2 -eq (32.9%). It is inferred that the LTTD treatment of contaminated soil can significantly reduce the environmental impact compared with conventional incineration and HTTD processes. Additionally, the LTTD-treated soil with coke or carbonized residue could act like biochar as a soil amendment. Approximately 50% of organic hydrocarbon contaminants are sequestered into coke or carbonized residues on the soil surface. With additional analyses of various oil-contaminated soils, the potential utility of LTTD-treated soils is expected to be maximized.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Investigations of a Hydrogen-Evolving Cobalt Diimine-Dioxime Complex in an Oxygen Environment: Roles of Secondary Coordination Sphere, Br&#248;nsted Acid, and Axial Ligand</title>

                The development of molecular electrocatalysts for fuel-forming reactions, such as the hydrogen-evolving reaction (HER) or the reduction of carbon dioxide, is generally hindered by their susceptibility to dioxygen in practical applications, which results from the concomitant formation of reactive oxygen species. The concept of a secondary coordination sphere (SCS) has been widely adopted in designing molecular electrocatalysts to promote the aforementioned energy-conversion reactions. The impact of this supernumerary interaction through the SCS on the oxygen-tolerant properties of molecular electrocatalysts is less explored. A HER electrocatalyst, cobalt diimine-dioxime complex, is one of the metal complexes designed by the concept of SCS to facilitate HER and retain its reactivity in an oxygen environment. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying its oxygen tolerance remains unclear. In this study, mechanistic studies of how this complex undergoes HER under aerobic conditions were conducted. The results reveal that the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) predominates in the presence of molecular oxygen. Further studies uncover the intramolecular proton transfer through SCS and intermolecular proton transfer from exogenous proton sources mutually dictate the product selectivity of ORR between H2O2 and H2O, thereby determining the stability of the complex under HER. In addition, the choice of labile ligands has emerged as a useful factor in enhancing oxygen tolerance. These findings provide valuable design principles for developing oxygen-tolerant molecular catalysts and shed light on how the interplay of proton transfer routes between the secondary coordination sphere and exogenous pathway can impact reactivity and product selectivity.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Adsorption on Solid and Liquid Surfaces of Ga&#8211;Sn and Ga&#8211;In</title>

                Abstract Dynamic liquid metal catalysts have remarkable activity and selectivity toward certain reactions, such as carbon dioxide reduction. The surface hydrogen coverage may play a role in this, including controlling competing reactions such as hydrogen evolution. Using a novel method of statistically selecting relevant snapshots from a dynamic liquid metal trajectory, the hydrogen adsorption energy is reported across liquid surfaces of Ga&#8211;Sn and Ga&#8211;In via density functional theory. A fully dynamic sampling of hydrogen adsorption to the liquid metal is also conducted with ab initio molecular dynamics at temperature. The results indicate that hydrogen only associates weakly with Ga&#8211;Sn and Ga&#8211;In surfaces, with minimal difference between the two materials. Hydrogen adsorbs only slightly more stably (&#8776;0.1 eV) to the liquid surfaces compared to the solid. A low hydrogen coverage is predicted on the liquid metal of &#8776;0.03 H &#197; &#8722;2 at potentials of around &#8211;1.15 V (vs RHE). However, the mobility of hydrogen on the liquid surface is much greater due to a novel mechanism whereby the dynamic surface rearranges, opening pathways for diffusion. The results suggest that the unique catalytic behavior of these liquid metal materials may be due to changes in adsorbate diffusivity when the metals are melted.</description>

      <title>Economic Globalization, Renewable Energy, and CO2 Emissions in Selected Emerging Countries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.15826/vestnik.2024.23.3.024</link>
      <description>Xenaneira Shodrokova, Anna Yulianita, Abdul Bashir, Journal of Applied Economic Research. 23(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402396017

                The phenomenon of economic globalization (EG) has a significant impact on CO2 emissions in emerging countries. This research seeks to examine the influence of EG and renewable energy consumption (REC) on CO2 emissions by utilizing secondary data from the World Bank spanning the years 2000 to 2022. The study hypothesizes that EG contributes to higher CO2 emissions, whereas the REC leads to a reduction in CO2 emissions. This study uses the Data Regression Results Panel with a Random Effect Model to analyze the data. The results show that EG contributes to economic growth accompanied by increased CO2 emissions. Rapid increases in economic activity and industrialization, often driven by FDI and international trade, lead to increased use of fossil energy and CO2 emissions. These findings support the pollution haven hypothesis that suggests that high-polluting production tends to move to countries with looser environmental regulations. However, the study also found that increased REC is associated with a decrease in CO2 emissions. The theoretical significance of the results of this study shows that while EG can drive economic growth, it also has a negative impact on the environment. In practical terms, this research underscores the necessity for policies that promote the use of renewable energy, enhance energy efficiency, and enforce stringent environmental regulations to mitigate the adverse environmental effects of economic globalization. Measures such as the promotion of renewable energy, the transfer of green technologies, increasing public awareness of environmental sustainability, diversifying the economy into greener sectors, and developing green infrastructure are essential.</description>

      <title>Performance of Zeolite-Based Soil&#8211;Geopolymer Mixtures for Geostructures under Eccentric Loading</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/infrastructures9090160</link>
      <description>Alaa H. J. Al-Rkaby, Infrastructures. 9(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402484636

                Although soil stabilization with cement and lime is widely used to overcome the low shear strength of soft clay, which can cause severe damage to the infrastructures founded on such soils, such binders have severe impacts on the environment in terms of increasing emissions of carbon dioxide and the consumption of energy. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate soil improvement using sustainable materials such as byproducts or natural resources as alternatives to conventional binders&#8212;cement and lime. In this study, the combination of cement kiln dust as a byproduct and zeolite was used to produce an alkali-activated matrix. The results showed that the strength increased from 124 kPa for the untreated clay to 572 kPa for clay treated with 30% activated stabilizer agent (activated cement kiln dust). Moreover, incorporating zeolite as a partial replacement of the activated cement kiln dust increased the strength drastically to 960 and 2530 kPa for zeolite ratios of 0.1 and 0.6, respectively, which then decreased sharply to 1167 and 800 kPa with further increasing zeolite/pr to 0.8 and 1.0, respectively. The soil that was improved with the activated stabilizer agents was tested under footings subjected to eccentric loading. The results of large-scale loading tests showed clear improvements in terms of increasing the bearing capacity and decreasing the tilt of the footings. Also, a reduction occurred due to the eccentricity decreasing as a result of increasing the thickness of the treated soil layer beneath the footing.</description>

                Abstract We describe and compare several options for decarbonisation of Oil &amp; Gas operations, from low hanging fruits to significant design changes to the addition of complete, major processes such as CCUS or electrification of large crackers. The comparison includes elements of feasibility in brownfield &amp; greenfield, technology availability, implementation costs, timeline &amp; risks, as well as ROI (Return On Investment) and CO2_OI (CO2 reduction impact On Investment). The analysis and recommendations in this paper are based on the experience of the author and are illustrated by several actual customer projects. The analysis on Low Hanging fruits is confirmed by a developing literature and third-party sources (eg Concawe Report 18/9, IHSMarkit&#8230;). The design paradigm shift suggestions are still a nascent domain. The analysis on large projects such as CCUS, Green or Blue Hydrogen or process electrification is also a first of a kind attempt to assess real long-term financial sustainability of these approaches and position them properly versus other decarbonization tracks. We describe a dozen &#8216;low hanging&#8217; decarbonization tracks. These start with the right GHG assessment and performance tool, based on the saying that you can't improve what you don't measure. These tracks are technically available and feasible today. They are compared in terms of feasibility in brownfield &amp; greenfield, implementation costs, timeline &amp; risks, as well as ROI and CO2_OI (Return On Investment and CO2 impact reduction On Investment). We also identify a number of design paradigm shifts, applicable for all greenfield projects. We provide some practical examples, from fully remote operations to flaring elimination. These design paradigm shifts are evaluated in terms of feasibility, ease of deployment. Suggestions are made on how to integrated them in design and operations philosophy. We eventually analyze approaches such as CCUS, Green or Blue Hydrogen or process electrification. These are often the only ones considered for process decarbonization, and benefit from major thought leadership and press coverage. We identify the pros and cons of these approaches and assess their real long-term financial sustainability. This paper reminds that Low Hanging fruits, mainly relied to Energy Efficiency and usually facilitated by Digital Transformation, present both a very favorable ROI and CO2-OI. The paper also presents a number of design paradigm shifts that are considered necessary to ensure carbon neutral infrastructure and operations. Last but not least, this paper reminds that some approaches like CCUS may have a significant impact on CO2 reduction, but the CO2_OI as well as all risk elements need to be carefully evaluated.</description>

                Abstract This work numerically studies the dynamics of a droplet, uncharged and freely suspended in an immiscible fluid, driven to move by the fringe electric field generated by parallel plate capacitors. Both the droplet and the suspending fluid are considered as leaky dielectrics. The deformation and migration of the droplet through the fringe electric field into or away from the parallel plate capacitors is our focus. A three-dimensional spectral boundary element method for interfacial dynamics in electrical fields is modified and adopted for the current study. The influences of the material properties of the pair of immiscible fluids including the viscosity ratio, surface tension, conductivity, and permittivity on the direction and velocity of the droplet migration will be investigated. The effects of operational and design parameters on droplet motion, including the electrical field strength and the parallel plates&#8217; gap width will be explored as well. In this preliminary study the numerical method will then be applied to investigate the entrapment processes of fine CO2 bubbles in two-dimensional MXene-membranes, a novel membrane technology newly developed for CO2 sensing, capture and reduction. This technology is being developed for an over-arching goal of understanding changes in ocean carbon cycle and controlling CO2 level globally. The efficiency of such a device will be discussed from the view point of fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>The effects of metal oxides doping on the surface stability of In2O3 for CO2 hydrogenation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0224256</link>
      <description>Xingtang Xu, Yanwei Li, Zhenhua Tao, Jianliang Cao, Yan Wang, Xu-Long Qin, AIP Advances. 14(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402513197

                The significance of maintaining the surface stability of the In2O3 catalyst in the conversion of CO2 to methanol through hydrogenation cannot be overstated. To improve surface stability, doping with metal oxides is usually employed. To explore high-efficiency In2O3 based catalysts, density functional theory calculations were utilized to explore the effects of doping CuO, Co2O3, NiO, TiO2, HfO2, Nb2O3, Ta2O5, and CeO2 on the stability of the In2O3(110) surface. It was found that in a CO atmosphere, the crucial step in determining the creation of oxygen vacancies on the In2O3 plane occurred during the desorption of CO2 from the vacancy location. The results indicate that doping CuO, Co2O3, NiO, Nb2O3, Ta2O5, and CeO2 on the In2O3(110) surface promotes the reduction process through the reaction of CO with the O atoms on the surface, resulting in reduced surface stability. Conversely, the doping of Ti and Hf can raise the reaction energy barriers for CO reacting with the O atoms on the surface and enhance CO2 molecule adsorption on vacant sites, thereby suggesting the potential of TiO2 and HfO2 as effective modifiers to improve the efficiency and durability of the In2O3 catalyst. Furthermore, it is crucial to enhance its stability by modifying the density of the electron cloud or Fermi level of the In2O3 catalyst.</description>

                Abstract Livestock methane (CH4) emissions total over 3 billion tonnes per year of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) and are responsible for approximately 6% of total annual greenhouse gas emissions. The contribution of livestock CH4 emissions are only to be exacerbated as the global demand for meat and dairy products increases. Greater than 75% of livestock CH4 emissions are generated in dispersed production environments (e.g., cow-calf and stocker segments), which are not addressable by methane mitigation strategies requiring constant inputs. Thus, strategies that fit into standard agronomic practices, in particular dispersed production environments, are urgently needed to address the increasing carbon footprint associated with livestock production. Methane-reducing vaccines are a promising solution for addressing this need, due to their longevity of action, low cost, and ease of integration into standard agronomic practices, which could lower the barrier for adoption. Thus, this study aimed to assess the effects of a prototype vaccine on total and antigen-specific immune response, CH4 yield, and average daily gain (ADG) in cattle. Angus crossbred steers [n = 20; initial body weight (BW) = 537 &#177; 15 kg) fed on a high-forage diet were randomly assigned to either placebo- or vaccine-treated groups blocked by BW, breed, and feed intake. Steers were subcutaneously inoculated (2 mL dose) in the anterior region of the neck. Blood and saliva samples were collected, and total sera and salivary immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA were quantified using ELISA (Bethyl laboratories, Montgomery, TX). Antigen-specific sera IgG was measured using ELISA. Daily CH4 emissions and dry matter intake (DMI) were measured using GreenFeed systems (C-Lock Inc. Rapid City, SD) and GrowSafe feed bunks (Vytelle, Lenexa, KS), respectively. Body weights were recorded bi-weekly. Total sera IgA and IgG did not differ between the placebo-treated and vaccinated steers (P = 0.584 and P = 0.425, respectively), nor did total salivary IgA and IgG (P = 0.577 and P = 0.548, respectively). However, antigen-specific sera IgG did significantly increase following booster vaccination in the vaccinated steers, as compared with placebo-treated steers (d 0 vs. d 28; P &amp;lt; 0.001). CH4 yield was significantly reduced in vaccinated steers following booster vaccination despite significantly increasing in placebo-treated steers over the same period (P = 0.002). This reduction in CH4 yield was not associated with a reduction in DMI nor ADG (P = 0.181 and P = 0.314, respectively), suggesting that vaccination did not negatively affect treated animals. These findings underscore the potential of vaccine-based solutions to mitigate the environmental impact of livestock CH4 emissions, especially from dispersed production environments where current options for mitigation strategies are limited.</description>

      <title>Highly Stable Propane Dehydrogenation on a Self&#8208;supporting Single&#8208;component Zn2SiO4 Catalyst</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202413297</link>

                Current industrial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes predominantly use either toxic Cr&#8208;based or expensive Pt&#8208;based catalysts, necessitating urgent exploration for alternatives. Herein, we present Zn2SiO4, an easily prepared, cost&#8208;effective material, as a highly efficient and stable catalyst for PDH. Uniquely, Zn2SiO4 nanocrystals do not require dispersion on support materials, commonly needed for catalytic active oxide clusters, but function as a self&#8208;supporting catalyst instead. During the reaction's induction period, surface Zn species on the Zn2SiO4 crystal reduce to coordinately unsaturated ZnOx single sites, serving as highly active catalytic centers. The Zn2SiO4 catalyst demonstrates a stable performance over 200 hours of PDH operation at 550 &#176;C. We further find that introducing a minuscule amount of CO2 into the propane feed significantly extends the catalyst lifespan to over 2000 hours. This enhancement arises from the special role of CO2 in facilitating the removal of strongly adsorbed H*, preventing the complete reduction of ZnOx. After prolonged reaction, the activity of Zn2SiO4 can be fully restored by etching the surface layer to expose fresh Zn species, available throughout the crystals. The combination of CO2 introduction and catalytic site regeneration strategies is expected to enable a year&#8208;long PDH operation using a single batch of Zn2SiO4 catalyst.</description>

      <title>A Study for Estimation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Cotton in Central Greece</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.32388/gh42x0.2</link>
      <description>Vassilis Engonopoulos, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402452945

                Cotton is an economically significant crop in Greece; however, there is a paucity of systematic quantification of greenhouse gas emissions associated with Greece's cotton production and analysis of the underlying causes. This study employed the Cool Farm Tool (CFT) to ascertain the principal constituents and motivating factors underlying the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with cotton production in Greece between 2020 and 2021, with reference to statistical data. The findings indicated that the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of cotton cultivated in the Sterea Hellada and Thessaly regions of Central Greece reached 2,126. This equates to a reduction of 10 kg CO2 eq ha-1 or 460.8 kg CO2eq t-1 yield, respectively. From 2020 to 2021, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increased by 107.7 kg CO2-eq ha-1 or 32.9 kg CO2 eq t-1 yield due to an increased number of irrigation events and pesticide applications, which were necessitated by the extremely high temperatures that occurred during the flower to open boll period. The multiple regression model demonstrated that fertilizers exerted the most significant influence on carbon emissions. Enhancing the efficiency of cotton fertilization and guaranteeing the robust advancement of the cotton industry through the implementation of high-quality cultivation strategies will prove an effective approach to reducing the carbon footprint of cotton cultivation in the future.</description>

      <description>Adel Miles, A. Bouchoucha, Driss Bendjaballah, South Florida Journal of Development. 5(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402542223

                The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of hydrogen injection on the performance of a mini turbo reactor. To achieve this, an experimental test bench was constructed, incorporating a specially designed mini turbo reactor capable of operating on various fuel mixtures and a dry cell electrolyzer for on-site hydrogen production. A comprehensive testing campaign was conducted, comparing the mini turbo reactor performance when fueled with pure propane and a propane-hydrogen blend at varying concentrations. Parameters evaluated included power output, thermal efficiency, fuel mass flow rate, flame temperatures, and pollutant emissions (CO, CO2, NOx). The experimental results unequivocally demonstrated that the addition of hydrogen to propane significantly enhances the mini turbo reactor specific power while concurrently reducing CO and CO2 emissions. Furthermore, data analysis revealed an improvement in the thermal efficiency of the cycle, suggesting potential reductions in specific fuel consumption. These findings highlight the promising potential of hydrogen injection as a strategy to enhance the performance and environmental impact of mini turbo reactor.</description>

      <title>Ink And Influence: The Role of Media on Climate Policy Understanding</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5195/cinej.2024.645</link>
      <description>&#304;brahim Dalk&#305;l&#305;&#231;, Nezahat Do&#287;an, CINEJ Cinema Journal. 12(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402474174

                The main purpose of this study is to investigate the role of media (including cinema) on the CO2 emission levels of The United States of America (USA). Employing three co-integration methods, namely Canonical Co-Integrating Regression (CCR), Dynamic Least Squares (DOLS), and Fully Modified Least Squares (FMOLS), within the framework of Environmental Kuznet Curves (EKC) theory, we unravel the impact of media coverage on the USA&#8217;s carbon footprint. Utilizing Climate Policy Uncertainty index (CPU), extracted from prominent USA newspapers as a main concern, the analysis reveals a noteworthy outcome indicating media coverage pertaining to environmental issues, pollution, and climate changes emerges as a contributing factor in the reduction of CO2 emissions. The study also uses income per capita, renewable energy consumption and foreign direct investment as additional metrics of air pollution. The findings not only shed light on the influential role of media in shaping environmental outcomes but also offer valuable insights to policy makers and governors.</description>

      <title>Pore-Scale Simulation of the Effect of Wettability Alteration on Flow Transport Kinetics in 3D Natural Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/223106-pa</link>
      <description>Yongfei Yang, H.Y. Li, Chuan Tong, Lei Zhang, Hai Sun, Junjie Zhong, Kai Zhang, Jun Yao, SPE Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402468078

                Summary Wettability alteration commonly occurs in subsurface two-phase displacements, such as enhanced hydrocarbon recovery, hydrogen storage, and carbon dioxide sequestration. A comprehensive understanding of two-phase flow transport kinetics during wettability alteration in natural rocks is essential for optimizing these processes. To address this, a wettability alteration model induced by low-salinity waterflooding (LSWF) was implemented based on the volume of fluid (VOF) method and the compressive continuous species transfer (C-CST) method in the OpenFOAM platform, which integrates the pore-scale two-phase fluid flow and the advection-diffusion of species. Following validation against experimental data from existing literature, extensive direct numerical simulations (DNSs) were conducted in an actual 3D sandstone sample obtained by microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) images. The effects of the wettability alteration degree, wettability alteration model, and capillary number on dynamic salt dispersion and fluid redistribution are considered in simulation works. The findings indicate that a higher wettability alteration degree facilitates the release of more oil trapped in smaller pores toward the outlet, while the mobilized oil might become trapped again due to snap-off in larger downstream pores. Moreover, due to the presence of alternative flow pathways in the system, the backflowed oil induced by heterogeneous salinity distribution might not be effectively recovered. A faster wettability alteration rate enhances the performance of LSWF because of the rapid reduction of entry capillary pressure and the delayed negative effect of salt dispersion. In terms of the capillary number, a higher capillary number accelerates the diffusion of species to the three-phase contact line and reduces the occurrence of snap-off retrapping, thereby increasing ultimate oil recovery. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the microscopic displacement mechanism during the wettability alteration processes, especially for LSWF, in 3D heterogeneous porous media.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app14188272</link>
      <description>Gorakshnath Takalkar, Sayma Akhter, Rahul R. Bhosale, Applied Sciences. 14(18)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402515786

                In this investigation, an effort was made to introduce Ag into the CeO2 fluorite crystal lattice to form Ce0.99Ag0.01O2-&#948; (ACRM) using an ammonium hydroxide-assisted co-precipitation method. The resulting powder obtained after the co-precipitation reaction, filtration, and drying was annealed at 800 &#176;C in a muffle furnace to obtain crystalline ACRM. The phase composition and microstructure of the synthesized ACRM were analyzed using a powder X-ray diffractometer (PXRD) and a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The characterized ACRM powder was then subjected to multiple thermochemical thermal reduction (TR) and CO2 splitting (CDS) cycles using a high-temperature thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The TR step was conducted using Ar gas as an inert atmosphere, maintaining the temperature at 1400 &#176;C for 60 min. Subsequently, the same powder was subjected to the CDS step by treating it with a gaseous mixture of 50% CO2 and Ar gas at 1000 &#176;C for 30 min. ACRM displayed stable redox reactivity towards thermochemical CDS cycles by generating an average of 50.9 &#956;mol of O2/g&#183;cycle and 101.6 &#956;mol of CO/g&#183;cycle, respectively, over 10 thermochemical cycles.</description>

      <title>EDUCATIONAL BUILDING RENOVATION USING GREEN ROOF TOWARDS ENERGY SAVINGS AND DECARBONIZATION OF CITIES</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.46793/ieep24.397g</link>
      <description>J. P. Gli&#353;i&#263;, Tamara Bajc, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402473828

                This paper presents an analysis of the possible application of green roof on an existing educational building with a flat roof, through an analysis of the degree of energy efficiency improvement and CO2 emission reduction. The goal of the paper is to show, through the preparation of the energy efficiency report and Energy passport, the green roof as an exceptional tool for ensuring sustainable development, decarbonization and improving the quality of life of people in urban areas. This is important because urban areas have limited space for green infrastructure and high level of pollution. The research also clearly defines the impact of green roof installations on energy savings with the share for heating of 15% and air quality contributing to the about 6% lower CO2 emission, with attached methodological explanations for their application. Economic analysis and profitability of the proposed project are also provided as an additional indication of the relevance of this type of practice. In the economic analysis, the key indicators of the profitability of the investment are studied, in this investigation, the net present value (NPV) and the payback period (PBP) of the green roof project. PBP of 22 years was obtained, but it should not be considered separately of the other benefits of green roofs, which are not measurable in money, such as lower pollution in cities, habitats for pollinators, additional green areas for people, prevention of floods, etc.</description>

      <title>How megacities can achieve carbon peak through structural adjustments: An input-output perspective</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad796a</link>
      <description>Yang Yang, Wang Yiqi, Junping Ji, Yong Wang, Qisheng Huang, Daojing He, Environmental Research Letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402433485

                Abstract There is still a huge gap between the emissions pathways of megacities and the pathways to meeting the targets set by the Paris Agreement. Compared with technological emission reductions, structural emission reduction can provide cities with more stable and sustainable carbon-peaking solutions. This study constructs a scenario-based input-output optimization model, adopting a novel carbon emission accounting method for purchased electricity that considers shared responsibility, and systematically evaluates the decarbonization paths of megacities and their impacts on economic growth, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. The results show that (a) through industry substitution and manufacturing restructuring, Shenzhen is projected to peak at 57.68 MtCO2 emissions in 2026, with a 10.57% energy and a 19.55% carbon reduction by 2030. (b) Shenzhen can achieve its carbon emission peak target through the energy transition while accepting a loss of 0.97%-3.23% of GDP, requiring the maximum economic concession of 16.45% from the transportation sector (S10) in the early stage of transformation, while 12.24% from the extractive industry (S2) in the later stage. (c) The comprehensive structure adjustment proved to be more effective than other mitigation approaches, capable of achieving high-quality economic growth of 6.4% during the study period while reaching a peak target of 53.55 million tons of CO2 by 2026. (d) The emission reduction effect of the power sector was the most significant among all the scenarios, with emission reduction rates between 6.26% and 35.63%, and the cumulative emission reduction potential reached 38.1-110.6 MtCO2. The priority for emission reduction in the power sector is the coal phase-out plan, which is essential for achieving these significant reductions. This study provides an important reference for megacities facing similar challenges, especially those in developing countries, to achieve a stable and sustainable carbon peak pathway through structural adjustment.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Feasibility of Chemical Looping CO Production from Blast Furnace Gas Based on Fe-Ca-Based Carriers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12091965</link>
      <description>Yang Gao, Huaqing Xie, Chao Sun, Mengxin Qin, Kun Wang, Zhushan Shao, Processes. 12(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402480085

                In this paper, a novel process for synergistic carbon in situ capture and the utilization of blast furnace gas is proposed to produce CO via chemical looping. Through thermodynamic analysis, this process was studied in terms of the carbon fixation rate, CO yield, in situ CO2 utilization rate, CH4 conversion rate and energy consumption. It provides valuable insights for achieving efficient CO2 capture and in situ conversion. FeO and CaO are used as the oxygen carrier and the carbon carrier, respectively. Under the conditions of reaction temperature of 400 &#176;C, pressure of 1 bar and FeO/CO ratio of 1, the carbon capture rate of blast furnace gas can reach more than 99%. In the carbon release reactor, the CO yield is lower than that in the original blast furnace gas (BFG) if no reduction gas is involved. Therefore, methane is introduced as a reducing gas to increase CO yield. When the reaction temperature is increased to 1000 &#176;C, the pressure level is reduced to 0.01 bar and the CH4/C ratio is 1:1 (methane to carbon), the CO yield is four times that of the initial blast furnace gas. Under the optimal conditions, the energy consumption of the system is 0.2 MJ/kg, which is much lower than that of the traditional process. This paper verifies the feasibility of the new process from the perspective of thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>Chongjian Wang, Hongliang Li, Jintao Wang, Xiuwu Liu, Tropical Journal of Pharmaceutical Research. 23(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402487904

                Purpose: To investigate the impact of tetrandrine tablets on cytokines, immune function, blood gas and respiratory function in patients with stage II pneumoconiosis. Methods: 136 subjects with stage II pneumoconiosis diagnosed and treated in People's Hospital of Linyi City, Linyi City, China were divided into control and study cohorts, each with 68 individuals. Patients in control cohort received conventional symptomatic treatment, while study cohort additionally received tetrandrine tablets orally 3 times per day, for 4 weeks. Lung function, serum indicators and blood gas indicators were determined before and after treatment. Results: After treatment, the levels of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and FEV1/FVC in both groups were significantly increased in both cohorts, with significantly higher values in study cohort. In both cohorts, there were higher post-treatment numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratio than before treatment, but with significantly higher values in study cohort (p &lt; 0.05). After treatment, there were significantly raised levels of peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), minute ventilation (VE) and tidal volume (VT) in the two cohorts, with higher values in the study group cohort (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, treatment resulted in a significant reduction in partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2), with significantly lower levels in study cohort (p &lt; 0.05). After treatment, concentrations of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1&#946;), matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), and tumor necrosis factor beta-1 (TNF-&#946;1) in study cohort were significantly reduced, relative to pre-treatment. Conclusion: Tetrandrine tablets are efficacious in stage II pneumoconiosis patients. The drug is beneficial in improving immune function, reducing levels of inflammatory mediators, and improving lung function and blood gas indicators in patients. Future studies incorporating additional parameters and a larger number of patients will be required to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the efficacy and safety of this treatment protocol.</description>

      <title>Greenhouse Gas Emissions from a 20-Year-Old Restored Peatland</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.24908/iqurcp18021</link>

                Peatlands are ecosystems with unique hydrological and ecological properties that serve as critical carbon reservoirs, helping facilitate the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG). In Canada, the peat industry uses vacuum harvesting to extract peat for horticultural use. This disturbs the natural ecosystem, increasing CO2 and decreasing CH4 emissions due to complete removal of surface vegetation and lowering of the water table. Following years of extraction, if these peatlands are not properly restored, GHG emissions will increase, negatively impacting the climate. The moss layer transfer technique (MLTT) is the primary method for restoring peatlands in Canada. The MLTT allows peatlands to regain their natural ecosystem function and to reaccumulate peat. This is done by revegetation of key species including sphagnum moss, and rewetting of the peatland through the blockage of drainage ditches. My research project investigates a peatland in Pointe-Lebel, Quebec restored in 2004 using MLTT following vacuum extraction. I used the closed chamber method to measure the CO2 and CH4 exchanges at the plant community scale and three repetitions of each of moss, shrubs, and cotton grass communities were followed throughout the summer. Wells at each collar provided the water table depth; a controlling variable for GHG fluxes. I conducted a vegetation survey at peak plant productivity to characterize the proportions of the plant communities and to allow chamber measurements of GHG to be scaled by the contribution of each plant community. If successful, a restored peatland will be a net sink of carbon. Preliminary data analysis at this 20-year-old restored site indicates a net CO2 sink during the summer of 2024. My data also suggests that the site is a small source of CH4. The results from my project will aid in advancing research on peatlands, stressing the importance of taking the proper steps towards restoration.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Engine Performance, Emissions, Noise, and Vibration: A Comparative Study of Diesel and Biodiesel Fuel Mixture</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.30939/ijastech..1495167</link>
      <description>Mahmut &#304;nce, Samet &#199;elebi, &#220;same Demir, Can HA&#350;&#304;MO&#286;LU, International Journal of Automotive Science And Technology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402501667

                This study investigates the performance, emissions, noise, and vibration characteristics of a single-cylinder, air-cooled, four-stroke diesel engine running on pure diesel (D100) and biodiesel blends (B10: 90% diesel, 10% biodiesel; B20: 80% diesel, 20% biodiesel) at 1800 rpm, where the engine delivers maximum torque. Key metrics such as torque, power, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), exhaust gas temperature, noise, vibration, and emissions (CO, CO2, HC, O2, NOx, and smoke opacity) were analyzed. The findings indicate that B10 enhances torque, power output, and overall fuel efficiency, especially at low to medium loads, with a significant 17.54% reduction in BSFC compared to D100 at 40% engine load. Vibration levels generally increased with biodiesel addition, while B10 and B20 both reduced smoke opacity, with B20 having a more substantial effect. HC emissions decreased at idle with B10 but increased at higher loads, suggesting more complete combustion with potential thermal stress on engine components. Noise and vibration results were mixed; B20 reduced noise at higher loads but increased vibration. At 100% load, B20 decreased noise by 1.42% compared to D100. Despite benefits such as improved torque and reduced particulate emissions, biodiesel blends, particularly B20, led to increased NOx and CO2 emissions, emphasizing the need for further op-timization of blend formulations and emission control strategies. This study provides valuable insights into the tradeoffs and potential of biodiesel blends as sustainable diesel alternatives.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Value Through the Adoption of Technologies to Ensure Near Zero Methane Emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/220438-ms</link>

                Abstract There is a wide agreement among scientists that methane emissions are under reported / counted or overlooked. Methane emissions are generally calculated using a combination of standard emission factors and engineering calculations. Oil and gas companies are under pressure to decarbonize their value chain. According to IPCC, "deep reductions" in non-CO2 emissions like methane are necessary to keep global average temperature rise within 1.5&#176;C. Company with an objective of reduction in methane emissions and enhancement of associated reporting is investing in a suite of technologies to reduce methane emissions and monitoring, measurement programs to minimize uncertainty in tracking and reporting of methane emissions. The best practices include various engineering solutions i.e. flare recovery systems, green completion, electrification of drives and deploying advanced aerial technologies such as satellite tracking and in-plant measurements using IR cameras, fixed sensors, spectrophotometers for accurate monitoring and measurement of methane emissions. Continuous emission monitoring system by top-down aerial surveys combined with source level emission monitoring assisted in identifying methane hotspots and developing emission reduction plans. These efforts will support ADNOC to achieve near zero methane emissions from our operated oil and gas assets by 2030 and will encourage our partners to achieve similar results. In recognition of efforts, OGMP has certified ADNOC as Gold Standard Reporting company. This certification demonstrates company commitment and our leadership role towards enhancing both quality and transparency of methane data reporting and identify intervention actions required to tackle global methane emissions.</description>

      <title>Stomatal and Non-Stomatal Leaf Responses during Two Sequential Water Stress Cycles in Young Coffea canephora Plants</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/stresses4030037</link>
      <description>Danilo For&#231;a Baroni, Guilherme Augusto Rodrigues de Souza, Wallace de Paula Bernado, Anne Reis Santos, Larissa Cris&#243;stomo de Souza Barcellos, Let&#237;cia Fernantes Tavares Barcelos, La&#237;sa Zanelato Correia, Claudio Martins de Almeida, Abra&#227;o Carlos Verdin Filho, Weverton Pereira Rodrigues, Jos&#233; C. Ramalho, Miroslava Rako&#269;evi&#263;, Eliemar Campostrini, Stresses. 4(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402416559

                Understanding the dynamics of physiological changes involved in the acclimation responses of plants after their exposure to repeated cycles of water stress is crucial to selecting resilient genotypes for regions with recurrent drought episodes. Under such background, we tried to respond to questions as: (1) Are there differences in the stomatal-related and non-stomatal responses during water stress cycles in different clones of Coffea canephora Pierre ex A. Froehner? (2) Do these C. canephora clones show a different response in each of the two sequential water stress events? (3) Is one previous drought stress event sufficient to induce a kind of &#8220;memory&#8221; in C. canephora? Seven-month-old plants of two clones (&#8217;3V&#8217; and &#8216;A1&#8217;, previously characterized as deeper and lesser deep root growth, respectively) were maintained well-watered (WW) or fully withholding the irrigation, inducing soil water stress (WS) until the soil matric water potential (&#936;msoil) reached &#8773; &#8722;0.5 MPa (&#8722;500 kPa) at a soil depth of 500 mm. Two sequential drought events (drought-1 and drought-2) attained this &#936;msoil after 19 days and were followed by soil rewatering until a complete recovery of leaf net CO2 assimilation rate (Anet) during the recovery-1 and recovery-2 events. The leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and leaf reflectance parameters were measured in six-day frequency, while the leaf anatomy was examined only at the end of the second drought cycle. In both drought events, the WS plants showed reduction in stomatal conductance and leaf transpiration. The reduction in internal CO2 diffusion was observed in the second drought cycle, expressed by increased thickness of spongy parenchyma in both clones. Those stomatal and anatomical traits impacted decreasing the Anet in both drought events. The &#8216;3V&#8217; was less influenced by water stress than the &#8216;A1&#8217; genotype in Anet, effective quantum yield in PSII photochemistry, photochemical quenching, linear electron transport rate, and photochemical reflectance index during the drought-1, but during the drought-2 event such an advantage disappeared. Such physiological genotype differences were supported by the medium xylem vessel area diminished only in &#8216;3V&#8217; under WS. In both drought cycles, the recovery of all observed stomatal and non-stomatal responses was usually complete after 12 days of rewatering. The absence of photochemical impacts, namely in the maximum quantum yield of primary photochemical reactions, photosynthetic performance index, and density of reaction centers capable of QA reduction during the drought-2 event, might result from an acclimation response of the clones to WS. In the second drought cycle, the plants showed some improved responses to stress, suggesting &#8220;memory&#8221; effects as drought acclimation at a recurrent drought.</description>

      <title>178 Programing the rumen microbiome to optimize microbial efficiency in high forage diets</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skae234.452</link>
      <description>Tim A. McAllister, Robert J. Gruninger, Stephanie A. Terry, Ajay Badhan, Yan Wang, Leluo Guan, Journal of Animal Science. 102(Supplement_3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402533540

                Abstract As the majority of energy and protein supplied to cattle arises as a result of ruminal fermentation, the rumen microbiome has an integral role in determining host feed efficiency. Counterintuitively, current evidence suggests that a less diverse rumen microbiome is associated with improved feed efficiency, possibly as a result of greater metabolic precision and avoidance of energy spilling fermentative pathways. The composition of the rumen microbiome is mainly determined by diet, but host traits such as rumen volume, rate of passage, rumination and immunity also have influence. Although less microbial diversity may improve feed efficiency in cattle fed a specific diet, reduced diversity may impair the ability of cattle to adapt to frequent changes in diet and the environment. Hydrogen exchange and capture is the energetic foundation of the rumen microbiome and considerable capital has been invested to develop additives that redirect hydrogen flow away from the reduction of CO2 to CH4 towards alternative sinks. These additives have been shown to reduce enteric CH4 emissions by 30 to 80%, but improvements in feed efficiency have been less than stoichiometric predictions. Approaches to improve the feed efficiency of cattle need to be multifaceted with consideration for host genetics, functional efficiency of the rumen microbiome, and the structure and composition of feed. Likewise, reductions in carbon emissions need to be broader than just CH4, with an appreciation of the role that cattle have within a circular bioeconomy to promote upcycling of nutrients and reductions in emissions from farming systems. Strategies to improve the efficiency of cattle production are a prerequisite for the sustainable intensification needed to ensure that the social license for milk and meat production from cattle is retained.</description>

      <title>301 Leveraging genomics to advance the breeding of Canadian livestock</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skae234.208</link>

                Abstract Implementing breeding strategies for a more sustainable food system is one of the most pressing topics for livestock industries. Although different species face different challenges, large-scale research projects can pave the way for future opportunities in these key sectors. Herein, we present two examples (dairy and poultry) of how research projects can result in meaningful changes to commercial breeding programs. The first example is an international large-scale dairy project, which will deliver a roadmap for greenhouse gas (GHG) management using genomics and nutrition. The project aims to facilitate a 55% reduction in GHG emissions from Canadian dairy at an estimated value of $338M CAD. This systems-level approach will leverage resources developed through previous and current large-scale projects to produce accurate multi-level emission estimates and identify opportunities to mitigate enteric GHG emissions. The results of this project will provide accurate, reliable, and robust data for industry stakeholders, national policy, and GHG inventories. The second example is a research collaboration with a commercial turkey breeding company that will enable breeding strategies for long-term and sustainable genetic improvement in health traits. This project aims to reduce preslaughter mortality by 5% and condemnations due to myopathies and health issues. This reduction alone is expected to result in 7.5M kg more turkey meat at a value of $19.8M CAD. Furthermore, there is also an expected reduction of 2.3M kg of CO2 equivalent per year for each 1% livability improvement due to production efficiencies and reduced inputs wasted for more sustainable and ethical meat production. Overall, ongoing and future research initiatives will continue to deliver solutions for key Canadian livestock sectors to improve animal health and welfare as well as efficiency and sustainability. The strides made in these ongoing collaborative projects are imperative for enhancing the sustainability of animal agriculture to feed the growing population.</description>

      <title>Improving Vehicle Warm-Up Performance Using Phase-Change Materials and Thermal Storage Methods</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17184556</link>
      <description>J. J. Lee, Jungkoo Lee, Kihyung Lee, Energies. 17(18)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402455448

                This study investigates the enhancement of vehicle warm-up performance using phase-change materials (PCMs) and various thermal storage methods. The primary objective is to utilize the thermal energy lost during engine cooling to improve the cold-start performance, thereby reducing fuel consumption and emissions. Thermal storage devices incorporating PCMs were developed and tested by measuring temperature changes and energy transfer over soaking periods of 4, 8, 16, and 24 h. The results show energy transfers of 591, 489, 446, and 315 kJ at 4, 8, 16, and 24 h, respectively. In terms of the warm-up time, the use of thermal storage devices reduced the time required to reach 70 &#176;C by up to 24.45%, with significant reductions observed across all soaking periods. This reduction in the warm-up time directly contributes to faster engine stabilization, leading to proportional improvements in fuel efficiency and a corresponding decrease in exhaust emissions, including CO2. The findings highlight the effectiveness of PCMs in improving the engine warm-up performance and emphasize the importance of optimizing thermal storage systems to balance energy efficiency and practical application considerations. Additionally, the experimental data provide useful benchmark information for computational simulation validation, enabling the further optimization of automotive thermal management systems. Integrating a PCM-based thermal storage device can significantly enhance a vehicle&#8217;s warm-up performance, leading to reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions.</description>

      <title>Promoting salt tolerance, growth, and phytochemical responses in coriander (Coriandrum sativum L. cv. Balady) via eco-friendly Bacillus subtilis and cobalt</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12870-024-05517-3</link>
      <description>Sary Brengi, Maneea Moubarak, Hany M. El-Naggar, Amira R. Osman, BMC Plant Biology. 24(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402403258

                Abstract In plant production, evaluation of salt stress protectants concerning their potential to improve growth and productivity under saline stress is critical. Bacillus subtilis (Bs) and cobalt (Co) have been proposed to optimize salt stress tolerance in coriander ( Coriandrum sativum L. cv. Balady) plants by influencing some physiological activities. The main aim of this work is to investigate the response of (Bs) and (Co) as eco-safe salt stress protectants to resist the effect of salinity, on growth, seed, and essential oil yield, and the most important biochemical constituents of coriander produced under salt stress condition. Therefore, in a split-plot factorial experiment design in the RCBD (randomized complete block design), four levels of salinity of NaCl irrigation water (SA) were assigned to the main plots; (0.5, 1.5, 4, and 6 dS m &#8722;1 ); and six salt stress protectants (SP) were randomly assigned to the subplots: distilled water; 15 ppm (Co1); 30 ppm (Co2); (Bs); (Co1 + Bs); (Co2 + Bs). The study concluded that increasing SA significantly reduced coriander growth and yield by 42.6%, which could be attributed to ion toxicity, oxidative stress, or decreased vital element content. From the results, we recommend that applying Bs with Co (30 ppm) was critical for significantly improving overall growth parameters. This was determined by the significant reduction in the activity of reactive oxygen species scavenging enzymes: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and malondialdehyde (MDA) and non-enzyme: proline by 5, 11.3, 14.7, and 13.8% respectively, while increasing ascorbic acid by 8% and preserving vital nutrient levels and enhancing plant osmotic potential to buffer salt stress, seed yield per plant, and essential oil yield increased by 12.6 and 18.8% respectively. The quality of essential oil was indicated by highly significant quantities of vital biological phytochemicals such as linalool, camphor, and protein which increased by 10.3, 3.6, and 9.39% respectively. Additional research is suggested to determine the precise mechanism of action of Bs and Co's dual impact on medicinal and aromatic plant salt stress tolerance.</description>

                Abstract Availability of essential relief systems at Oil Processing facilities is highly required to ensure safe handling of hydrocarbons during depressurization scenarios to avoid escalation of emergency situations. During maintenance of close drain systems, facilities are isolated, drained &amp; depressurized. Innovative methodology and strategic initiative piloted by ADNOC-Onshore Asset that enabled uninterrupted operations without close drain system by managing makeshift arrangements, avoided 45 days Station shutdown along with flaring of 3 MMscf gas/ 168 Tons CO2. To ensure essential relief system availability during maintenance and keeping station operational, all technical aspects utilizing external equipment reviewed. Key challenges were collaboratively evaluated in detail to enlist backup equipment requirements. To develop and execute this sustainable production approach, following method employed: Different emergency scenarios evaluated due to unavailability of drain system.Arranged backup draining/venting system (Containing Portable test separator, storage tank and pump arrangement).Performed comprehensive risk assessments and developed operational strategy to operate remote station with temporary arrangements.Work instructions revised.Requisite training imparted to operations staff to handle backup system.Mock drills conducted to verify workforce readiness. During the unavailability of essential relief systems, stations are depressurized to avoid any unforeseen scenarios that may escalate the unforeseen emergency situation. However, with the intention of keeping the station in operation to meet mandated &amp; sustainable production targets and ensuring safety of the facility and with the mindset of Net Zero flaring, this strategic resolution was piloted and implemented in house, in line with management of change procedures and protocols. Following benefits pertaining to Sustainability-Enabling Net zero were realized from this piloted novel approach: Production gain of 450,000 Barrel of Oil (10,000 barrels of oil per day for 45 days)Avoided 3 MMscf gas flaring &#8211; Reduction in GHG Emissions &#8211; 168 Tons CO2.Reduction in operational risk due to handling of hazardous hydrocarbons while carrying out depressurization activity. Implementation of this innovative and strategic solution has ensured continuous production from remote station, even in during the unavailability of essential relief system with the help of tailored made solution, that also eradicated the flaring of huge volumes of gas. The implemented solution is highly effective in ensuring continuous production with the mindset of Net zero flaring and can be replicated to other existing remote facilities in the company as well as Worldwide as best industry practice. This implementation will enhance the availability of relief system as well as ensuring the integrity of network and facilities thus avoiding flaring and liquid carry over during depressurization. This paper also demonstrates how the different approach can result in gaining continuous production form the facility and how the gas flaring can be abated for minimizing the environmental impacts. Technical challenges and solutions for alternate equipment, installing, and operating the system along with an insight using in house resources. The paper also highlights equipment selection and best practices for future replication by other Oil &amp; Gas Producers.</description>

                Climate change may be the single largest threat facing humanity and ecosystems, necessitating decarbonization across all sectors, including healthcare and academia. With the aim of informing and supporting sustainable research practices, we performed a life cycle assessment of a clinical trial conducted in Mali. The trial involved 80 malaria-infected participants in Ou&#233;less&#233;bougou who were treated with antimalarials and followed for 28 days to determine their clinical and transmission-blocking efficacy. Data on consumables, transportation, travel, and electricity use were collected in Mali and the Netherlands, where additional laboratory analyses and sample storage occurred. Data were analysed using the ReCiPe 2016 method for midpoint impact assessment. The trial involved 3 intercontinental shipments of materials and samples, 59,900 km of travel by research staff, and ~55 kg of plastics. Trial conduct and reporting resulted in 20.5 metric tonnes of CO2-equivalent (CO2e) emissions. Major contributors were international travel (50%), electricity in Mali (28%), and air-transportation (14%). Laboratory consumables, while contributing up to 22% of the trial&#8217;s impact on land and water use, were less important sources of emissions (2% of CO2e). Whereas the electricity mix in Mali, ~60% fossil-fuel-based, was disadvantageous for the carbon footprint, laboratory analyses in the Netherlands benefited from 100% wind energy, resulting in a minor overall contribution to emissions (&amp;lt;1%). We observed no loss in stability of parasite genetic material (mRNA) in protective buffers when stored for 12 months at -20&#176;C, compared to conventional -70&#176;C. These results form a foundation for improving the environmental sustainability of clinical trials in Africa. Switching to energy-efficient equipment settings could reduce electricity consumption by over 30%. Implementing solar panels in the Mali laboratory would reduce CO2e emissions by 28%. Immediate CO2e reductions can be achieved through online conference attendance and alternative sample transportation, which would contribute an additional 10% CO2e reduction.</description>

                Abstract. Simple climate models that are computationally inexpensive, transparent, and easy to modify are useful for assessing climate policies in the presence of uncertainties. This motivated the creation of SURFER v2.0, a model designed to estimate the impact of CO2 emissions and solar radiation modification on global mean temperatures, sea-level rise, and ocean pH. However, SURFER v2.0 is unsuitable for simulations beyond a few thousand years because it lacks some carbon cycle processes. This is problematic for assessing the long-term evolution of ice sheets and the associated sea level rise. Here, we present SURFER v3.0, an extension to SURFER v2.0 that allows for accurate simulation of the climate, carbon cycle, and sea level rise on time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. We incorporated in the model a dynamic cycling of alkalinity in the ocean, a carbonate sediments reservoir, and weathering fluxes. With these additions, we show that SURFER v3.0 reproduces results from a large class of models, ranging from centennial CMIP6 projections to 1 Myr runs performed with the cGENIE model of intermediate complexity. We show that compared to SURFER v2.0, including long-term carbon-cycle processes in SURFER v3.0 leads to a stabilisation of the Greenland ice sheet for the middle of the road emission scenarios, and a significant reduction in sea level rise contribution from Antarctica for high emissions scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment of Hydraulic Fracturing</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/220480-ms</link>
      <description>Abdul Muqtadir Khan, Calvin J. Anderson, Rasika Prabhu, Anna Beletskaya, Pearl Kuan, Samuel Danican, Farshid Mostowfi, No host. 377(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402426251

                Abstract The oil and gas industry has been taking steps to achieve sustainable growth. Most E&amp;P companies have declared their commitment to a carbon-neutral future. The first step in realizing a carbon-neutral future is to identify high-intensity operations such as unconventional hydraulic fracturing and reduce their emissions. Therefore, the primary objective of this work is to quantify the main sources of emissions in the hydraulic fracturing value chain and identify technologies that could drastically reduce those emissions. The main purpose of this work is to identify nearly all sources of emissions and the scale of their impact. Once the main emission sources are identified in the entire unconventional fracturing chain, we then focus on technologies that enable significant emission reduction. We employed qualitative and quantitative analysis to assess the emissions impact of diesel engines, material transportation, and water utilization. Our observations yielded a high-level view of emission intensity across the value chain of hydraulic fracturing. As expected, the fuel consumption of fracturing pumps was the top contributor with more than 30% of overall emissions. Flaring for cleanup came second with 26% contribution in our base case. While the emissions of the fracturing fleets are often very visible due to their large footprint and duration, surprisingly, the emissions of nonroutine flaring are just as impactful. In fact, nonroutine flaring could have much higher impact depending on how fast the cleanup process could take place, which may not be easy to predict. We observed that using natural gas in internal combustion engines reduced the CO2 emissions. However, the methane leak from engines would offset the CO2 savings and render the benefits marginal. We also observed that the reuse of produced water to be a feasible way to reduce the well stimulation footprint on water resources, which could be enabled by improved water treatment techniques at scale, advances in hydraulic fracturing fluid composition, and appropriate infrastructure. We quantified the upstream emissions (embodied carbon) of commonly used chemicals. Our calculations show that the embodied carbon of commonly used chemicals in unconventional fracturing is rather small. Our conclusions emphasize the importance of adopting ecofriendly technologies to address the challenges posed by hydraulic fracturing. This study contributes a high-level, yet accurate, perspective on emissions of the hydraulic fracturing process. We highlight the high-emitting steps in the process and identify technology gaps that could reduce the emission footprint of the industry. This research underscores the urgency of adopting responsible practices in hydraulic fracturing for a harmonious coexistence with global sustainability objectives.</description>

      <title>Exploring Psychological Factors Influencing the Adoption of Sustainable Public Transit Considering Preference Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16187924</link>
      <description>Gyeongjae Lee, Sujae Kim, Jahun Koo, Sangho Choo, Sustainability. 16(18)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402448235

                Carbon emission reduction strategies are being implemented in the transportation sector by encouraging the adoption of eco-friendly vehicles and introducing demand management policies such as Mobility as a Service (MaaS). Nevertheless, the efficacy of MaaS in reducing carbon emissions remains uncertain. This study introduces Sustainable Public Transit (SPT) as a public transit alternative consisting of only green modes to promote sustainability. We explore the preferences of SPT in a commuting context, incorporating individual preference heterogeneity in a discrete choice model. We systematically identify the relationship between choice behaviors and individual heterogeneity in alternative attributes and psychological factors stemming from socio-demographic characteristics. The integrated choice and latent variable (ICLV) model with a mixed logit form is adopted, and the key findings can be summarized as follows: Preference heterogeneity is observed in the travel cost variable, which can be explained by characteristics such as the presence of a preschooler, household size, and income. CO2 emissions do not have a statistically significant impact on choices. Furthermore, psychological factors are also explained through socio-demographic characteristics, and it is found that low-carbon knowledge positively influences low-carbon habits. Psychological factors significantly affect choices. Respondents who dislike transfers and prioritize punctuality are less likely to choose SPT, while those who have positive low-carbon attitudes are more likely to do so. Finally, scenario analysis is conducted to forecast mode share based on improvements in SPT alternative attributes and variations in attribute levels. Policy implications are then provided to enhance the acceptability of SPT.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.5812/fga-147734</link>
      <description>Fatemeh Salehi, Saeideh Shams Zamenjani, Saum Rahimi, Mina Fatehnejad, Elham Feizabad, Sara Saeedi, Fertility Gynecology and Andrology. 4(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402414016

                Background: Shoulder pain following gynecological laparoscopy is a common complication that requires treatment. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of manual maneuvers on shoulder pain following laparoscopic surgery in women. Methods: This parallel clinical trial was conducted with 77 female laparoscopy candidates referred to Yas Hospital in Tehran in 2023. After the laparoscopic procedure, the intervention group had CO2 gas actively removed from the abdomen during a two-handed abdominal massage, while the control group received only traditional passive gas evacuation. The intensity of pain was assessed 6- and 24-hours post-operation using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and the number of painkillers and anti-nausea medications used was recorded in each patient's chart. All data were entered into SPSS software and analyzed using appropriate statistical tests. Results: The average age of the women was 39.4 &#177; 10.1 years, and the average body mass index (BMI) was 27.5 &#177; 2.5 kg/m&#178;. No significant difference was observed between the two groups in these characteristics. Six hours after the operation, the pain intensity was 4.6 &#177; 0.86 in the intervention group and 6.2 &#177; 1.1 in the control group, with a significant reduction in the intervention group (P = 0.001). Twenty-four hours post-operation, pain intensity was 2.7 &#177; 0.79 in the intervention group and 4.2 &#177; 1.1 in the control group, again showing a significant decrease in the intervention group (P = 0.001). Additionally, the need for analgesics was significantly lower in the intervention group (P = 0.001). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that manual abdominal massage following laparoscopic surgery can significantly reduce shoulder pain, decrease the need for analgesics, and enhance patient satisfaction.</description>

      <description>Maheswaran Rohan, Ashima Sharma, Mohammed Ismail Nizami, Lubna Tarannum, Emergency Care Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402446901

                The aim of our study was to determine whether high flow oxygen therapy reduced the rate of endotracheal intubation and improve pulmonary outcome score. A total of 300 consecutive patients were enrolled in the study. The etiologies of acute respiratory failure were classified into trauma, lung diseases, fluid overload states and undifferentiated. Patients were randomized by block randomization method into two groups. First group received HFNC while the second received conventional oxygen therapy. Patients in both the groups were escalated to either NIV or invasive mechanical ventilator support if there were any signs of respiratory distress noted. Pulmonary outcome scoring done at 2 hours was designed to see if there was any improvement in patient&#8217;s condition in both the groups. SPSS (version 21.0, Illinois, Chicago) was used for the statistical analysis. The partial pressures of oxygen improved significantly in the HFNC group as compared to the COT group irrespective of the etiology. The partial pressures of CO2 on ABG were similar in both the groups until 12 hrs. However, pCO2 was earlier reduced in the HFNC group as compared to the COT group. Steady decrease in serum lactate levels were observed in HFNC group. The base deficit was corrected between 6-12 hours in patients of HFNC group which could not be seen in patients of COT group. There was a statistically significant difference noted at 12 and 24 hours between the two groups. The mean length of stay in HFNC group was around 4 days which was less compared to the length of hospital stay in COT which was an average of 7 days. The mortality in HFNC group was 4% and in COT group was 7.33% in our study. The study demonstrated that the use of HFNC in ED patients presenting with AHRF was associated with a greater reduction in need for escalation of ventilation requirements and improves pulmonary outcomes compared with standard oxygen therapy.</description>

                Purpose: To determine the bioactive compounds in Moringa oleifera (MO) and Acanthospermum hispidum (AH) with antioxidant, anticancer, antifungal and antibacterial potentials. Methods: Fresh leaves of these plants were collected from Akinmoorin and Awe, Oyo State, Nigeria. Particle-induced x-ray emission (PIXE) technique was performed using a 2.5MeV proton beam (a non-destructive elemental analysis). Phytochemicals were qualitatively analyzed using High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatographic-mass spectrophotometer (GC-MS) and standard procedures. Disc diffusion method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for fungi and bacteria. Antioxidant properties were carried out by DPPH radical scavenging activity. Cancer cells (MDAMB 231 and HTC 15) were cultivated in the presence of the extracts at body temperature with 5 % CO2 and 95 % air in 100 % relative humidity. Thereafter, adherent cells were seeded and treated with increasing concentrations of the plant extracts for 48 &#8211; 72 h. Results: Phytochemical analysis showed that both plants contain alkaloids, flavonoids, anthraquinones, steroids and terpenoids, saponins, tannins, phenols and glycosides. The MIC for MO on fungi was 21.0 and 12.0 mg/mL for AH. Furthermore, MO MIC for bacteria was 25.25 mg/mL and 9.75 mg/mL for AH. Antioxidant properties revealed MO having 80.02 % and AH, 76 % at 32.00 &#181;L. The ethanolic extracts showed a 50 % reduction in cancer cell viability at 24.5 &#956;g/mL for MO and 16.0 &#956;g/mL for AH, respectively, on MDAMB 231 and HTC 15 cells. Conclusion: Moringa oleifera (MO) and Acanthospermum hispidum (AH) extracts exhibit significant antioxidant, antitumor, antifungal and antibacterial activities. Further studies will require that the active constituents be isolated and formulated into suitable dosage forms.</description>

      <title>379 Application of an energy and nutrient matrix to a diet supplemented with a novel phytase achieved a production and sustainability benefit in pigs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/jas/skae234.284</link>
      <description>Deepak Velayudhan, Janet C Remus, Yueming Dersjant-Li, Ester Vinyeta, Journal of Animal Science. 102(Supplement_3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402541986

                Abstract The capacity of a novel consensus bacterial 6-phytase variant (PhyG) to maintain growth performance and production benefits of pigs when added to an energy and nutrient-reduced mixed cereal diet was assessed. Two experiments were conducted. In Exp. 1 (wean to finish), weaned pigs [n = 192; initial body weight (BW) 7.18 &#177; 0.38 kg] were randomized to 4 treatments from weaning until market weight. Diets were provided in 5 phases. Treatments included: 1) a nutritionally sufficient positive control (PC); 2) a negative control (NC1) without added inorganic phosphate, reduced (based on specific PhyG dose) in net energy (NE), calcium (Ca), digestible amino acids (AA) and sodium (Na) vs. PC, supplemented with PhyG at 1,000, 1,000, 750, 500 and 500 FTU/kg in each phase, respectively (NC1+low PhyG); 3) a negative control (NC2) as NC1 supplemented with PhyG at 2,000, 2,000, 1,000, 750 and 750 FTU/kg in each phase and further reduced in energy and nutrient based on specific PhyG dose (NC2+high PhyG), and; 4) a negative control (NC3) as 2) and supplemented with xylanase&#8211;&#946;-glucanase (XB) to provide 2,400 U/kg xylanase and 304 U/kg &#946;-glucanase, with additional reduction in NE and digestible AA based on the contribution of XB (NC3+low PhyG + XB). In Exp. 2 (nursery), weaned pigs (n = 360; initial BW 8.40 &#177; 0.78 kg) were assigned to 3 dietary treatments from weaning up to 35 d. Diets were offered in 2 phases. Treatments included a nutritionally adequate positive control (PC) and 2 PhyG-supplemented diets, reduced in digestible phosphorus, Ca, Na, NE and digestible AA vs. PC, according to the expected contribution of PhyG added at 1,000 FTU/kg (NC1) or 2,000 FTU/kg (NC2), respectively. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. Means separation was by Tukey&#8217;s HSD test. In Exp. 1, overall growth performance (114 d) in all enzyme-supplemented diets was maintained or improved compared with PC. Compared with PC, feed cost per kg BW gain was significantly reduced by 7.3% and total carbon footprint (CFP; CO2 eq. g/kg BW gain) was reduced by 6.8% with PhyG + XB combination. In Exp.2, overall growth performance (35 d), in all PhyG-supplemented, nutrient-reduced, treatments, were either not different from, or were improved, vs. PC. Total feed costs and estimated CFP per kg BW gain were reduced in all PhyG-supplemented, nutrient- and NE-reduced treatments vs. PC. In conclusion, the application of a full energy and nutrient matrix maintained the overall growth of pigs in both 114- and 35-d studies with the novel phytase. The addition of XB further improved the overall growth of market pigs. Moreover, full matrix application with PhyG achieved reductions in total feed cost and carbon footprint in both studies.</description>

      <title>Thinking Differently &#8211; Energy Optimization and Flaring Reduction Approach Improvising Sustainable Production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/220346-ms</link>
      <description>Sajjad Akhtar, A. Al Ketbi, G. Al Katheiri, M. K. Al Mazrouei, Muhammad Aslam, Yousof Al-Hammadi, F. Haider, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402426170

                Abstract This paper presents the innovative practice and tactical initiative adapted by ADNOC-Onshore Asset to ensure sustainable production from the facility by thinking differently and avoiding standby pump startup with mindset of optimizing energy and avoiding flaring gas volumes. As per operational conditions and to meet production mandate, the deem necessity of 2nd pump startup reevaluated and avoided by implementing this innovative approach and resulted in energy consumption optimization and avoided huge volume of gas flaring. The alternate approach adapted due to following main challenges: MPP High energy consumption at flowing wells extra loadHigh water flow envisaged the requirement of operating two pumps specially in summer when MPP suction temperature rises.Suction pressure increases upon MPP trip. To re start pump with minimum suction pressure permissive it requires to depressurize suction header. Consequently, list of high potential wells developed, MPPs turndown capacities analyzed. Hence high potential wells operated through MPP bypass and low potential wells kept flowing through MPP. It resulted in not only reducing load on running MPP but also 2nd MPP operation avoided. This strategic resolution was implemented in house without extra cost. Following benefits were obtained from this exercise and will remain beneficial in future also: Energy conservation due to less load on running MPP and hence avoiding the operation of 2nd MPP &#8211; daily use of extra 1000kW (18k USD per annum considering power cost 190 AED/1000kwh) was saved. 3000 Metric Ton CO2 Saved due to Green Power saving.Less corrective maintenance due to single MPP operationSuction strainer maintenance and also new strainer cost was avoided - 20k AEDMeeting monthly targets without compromising production allowableMin GHG emissions (54 tons eq CO2) while draining/depressurization during MPP trip &#8211; suction pressure increases due to MPP trip because of non-smart wells. In order to re start pump and to obtain min suction pressure start up permissive it was required to depressurize header.No extra cost in this project but cost saving with continuous production.Continuous &#172;4000 BOPD production in case of MPP trip over the night or daytime - considering 2 trips per annum. This in-house completed strategic solution resulted in ensuring continuous production from the station and thus avoiding flaring. The implemented pilot solution is highly effective in ensuring continuous production, optimizing energy consumption and can be replicated to other existing facilities in the company. This implementation will enhance the availability of facility with Standby equipment and also proved helpful in contributing under the pillar of Sustainability &#8211; Reduction in flaring/optimizing energy. The characteristics and sustainable production of the high potential wells were evaluated and listed down. The effect of back pressure on the flow of the wells assessed. MPP operation at low throughput provided confidence to reduce the suction flow. Following the minimum flow requirement of MPP, potential of the wells to be taken on MPP bypass and mindset to reduce GHG emissions through any opportunity assisted to finalize the mode of remote field operation. Taking the advantage of production cushion, MPP was further utilized to divert more flow from future wells. Due to high water cut and increase in suction temperature of MPP, it was required to curtail the production through certain wells to overcome temperature issue. High water flow envisaged the requirement of operating two pumps specially in summer when MPP suction temperature was rising up. Diverting the high potential wells, avoided the start-up of 2nd pump hence reducing the extra power consumption of 1000kwh. Resulted in optimizing the energy from running MPP also. In case of pump of any running pump tripping, suction pressure goes up due to connectivity of non smart wells with the suction header. MPP constitutes certain suction pressure permissive. In order to achieve suction pressure, it is envisaged to depressurize suction pressure to relief/close drain system which lead to flaring / GHG emissions.</description>

      <title>Reducing Carbon Footprint: A Field Study of Low Carbon, Cement-Free Well Construction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/220420-ms</link>
      <description>Mark Meade, Veronica Richter McDonald, Normann Fischer, Saurabh Kapoor, William Smith, Yeukayi Nenjerama, Ronal Bejarano, R. Angel, Chris Parton, Guillaume Landry, No host. 28(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402426187

                Abstract Well construction includes hard-to-abate emissions, notably from its well cementing operations. Reducing carbon emissions associated with cement is a priority because cement is used in nearly every well drilled today, with an impact of approximately one ton of carbon emissions per ton of cement used. This paper presents an innovative technology: making well cementing without Portland cement at scale a reality. Geopolymers made from aluminosilicates comprising industrial waste materials are considered a sustainable alternative to Portland cement. Existing geopolymer formulations found in academia are not scalable for land-based well construction cementing operations, as they are unmixable using standard equipment and have increased health, safety, and environmental risks (HSE). Thus, a novel geopolymer blend was engineered for well construction applications that is mixable with existing equipment and reduces HSE risk through eliminating the onsite handling of corrosive liquids. Additionally, a Sustainability Assessment Tool was created to quantify and compare carbon emissions at different steps such as manufacturing materials, transportation, and onsite operations. Field trials of the novel geopolymer blend in the fast-paced Permian Basin confirmed this technology could be implemented within the oilfield cementing process with the same efficiency and efficacy as the conventional cement-based operation. During the field trials, the geopolymer system was deployed without any changes to the field mixing equipment and without any HSE incidents. Sonic logs of a subset of wells confirmed conventional logging equipment can detect set geopolymer within the wellbore and validates industry-standard simulators to predict placement. Using the Sustainability Assessment Tool confirmed that the emissions from the slurry components are more significant than the emissions related to logistics and operations. The quality and availability of the emission factors of slurry components are key, with multiple data sources considered for reliable quantification. The proposed low-carbon geopolymer cement-free system in current field application eliminates up to 85% of Scope 3 CO2 emissions compared with conventional Portland cement systems. The industry can capitalize on these benefits with no change in operations or increased HSE risks. Decarbonizing the well construction process while maintaining safety and performance standards is critical to the oil and gas industry's pathway to meeting emissions reduction targets. This geopolymer cement-free system is a breakthrough that delivers industry-standard zonal isolation capabilities while significantly minimizing environmental impact from upstream oil and gas production.</description>

                Abstract Reducing methane (CH4) emissions from beef cattle is desirable as CH4 is a greenhouse gas that represents an energetic loss from the production system. Limestone is commonly fed to cattle as a source of calcium but may also act as a rumen buffer and decrease CH4 emissions by limiting hydrogen availability for methanogenesis. The objective of this experiment was to determine if diet limestone concentration influences growth performance, gas flux, and carcass characteristics in finishing beef cattle. Yearling steers [n = 16; initial body weight (BW) 619 &#177; 34 kg] were stratified by BW and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 isocaloric and isonitrogenous dietary treatments in a completely randomized design where limestone was included at 1.3% (1X) or 2.6% (2X) of diet dry matter (DM). Finishing diets were formulated to contain 0.43 or 0.96% DM as Ca and were fed ad libitum using automated cattle feeders (SmartFeed Pro; C-Lock Inc.; Rapid City, SD) in a single pen for the final 37 d of finishing. Body weights were measured on d -1, 0, 36, and 37. An automated head chamber system (GreenFeed; C-Lock Inc.) was used to measure gas flux. Analysis of variance was conducted using JMP Pro 17 to determine the fixed effect of treatment with individual animal as the experimental unit. Statistical significance was defined as P &#8804; 0.05 with a tendency defined as 0.05 &amp;lt; P &#8804; 0.10. Increasing the dietary limestone concentration from 1.3 to 2.6% of DM did not influence DM intake, but numerically increased final shrunk BW (P = 0.68) and hot carcass weight (P = 0.75) and increased average daily gain (ADG; P = 0.02) and gain to feed ratio (G:F) by approximately 12%. Cattle fed the 2X diet tended to have 6.5% greater ribeye area (P = 0.09), but similar USDA yield grade, backfat thickness, and dressing percentage (P &#8805; 0.34) when compared with cattle fed the 1X diet. Daily CO2 and CH4 emissions, daily O2 consumption, CH4 yield, and respiratory quotient were unaffected by treatment (P &#8805; 0.47). The improvement in ADG resulted in a tendency for CH4 emission intensity to be decreased by 9.1% (P = 0.09) when the concentration of limestone was 2.6% of dietary DM. While increasing dietary limestone concentration from 1.3 to 2.6% of diet DM did not influence absolute daily CH4 emissions, it increased ADG through an improvement in feed efficiency, which translated to a tendency for a reduction in CH4 emission intensity. These preliminary data suggest that there may be a benefit to feeding limestone or calcium at levels greater than currently recommended by the NASEM (2016). Future research should focus on determining optimum dietary limestone or calcium levels for finishing cattle.</description>
