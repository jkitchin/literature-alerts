      <title>Study Effect of rGO Addition on Photocatalytic Activity of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in Reducing Carbon Dioxide Using Electrochemical Method</title>

                Abstract Increasing the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration every year can cause various environmental problems. One of the technologies to reduce CO 2 is carbon capture. The semiconductor of TiO 2 is widely used as a photocatalyst to reduce CO 2 . However, TiO 2 has limitations in absorbing light in the visible region because it has a large band gap value. Besides, TiO 2 has a fast recombination of electron-hole pairs so it can reduce photocatalytic activity. An addition of rGO is expected to cover the shortcomings of TiO 2 because rGO has good conductivity and a small band gap. We synthesized rGO-TiO 2 photocatalyst and measured its activity in capturing and converting CO 2 using an electrochemical method. By using voltage difference as an electron driver in reacting with CO 2 we observe the reaction between electrons and CO 2 . The measurements were carried out under irradiated and unirradiated conditions. The CV measurements show that the rGO-TiO 2 electrode with 60% rGO content has reduction and oxidation peaks. Based on the electrochemical half-reaction table, the reduction peaks in unirradiated conditions indicate the conversion of CO 2 to CH 4 and (COOH) 2 , while under irradiated the reduction peak indicates the formation of HCOO &#8722; and CH 2 CH 2 . The results show that by using the rGO-TiO 2 composite as an electrode not only reduces CO 2 but also converts the CO 2 into hydrocarbon.</description>

                The reduction of CO2 has become a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in efforts to search for long&#8208;term responses to climate change. We report a a couple of CO2&#8208;reducing molecular catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant copper complexes. These are [Cu(DPA)(PyNAP)] (1) and [Cu(DPA)(PyQl)] (2) (where, DPA = pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, PyNAP = 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, and PyQl = 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline). The copper metal&#8208;catalysed 2&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO in the presence of 2&#8208;protons is challenging. These catalysts exhibit the production of CO gas in DMF/water mixtures, achieving an impressive faradaic efficiency of 84% and 72% for complex 1 and 2 at &#8208;1.7 V vs. SCE, respectively, for selective CO2 reduction. The production of H2 due to 2H+ + 2e&#8208; was also observed as a byproduct through the competitive proton reduction reaction. This was cross&#8208;verified by online gas and mass analysis. Our investigations confirmed the stability of the electrocatalysts under the electrocatalytic conditions. The mechanistic pathways were proposed to work with the EECC and ECEC (E: electrochemical and C: chemical) mechanisms. A CO2 insertion into an in&#8208;situ generated hydride from the Cu&#8208;center generates CO through the favourable path.</description>

      <title>Cu-supported ZnO in Conditions of CO2 Reduction to Methanol: Why 0.2 ML Coverage?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-nbz3p</link>
      <description>Robert H. Lavroff, Edison Cummings, Kaustubh J. Sawant, Zisheng Zhang, Philippe Sautet, Anastassia N. Alexandrova, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403701334

                By hydrogenating carbon dioxide to value-added products such as methanol, heterogenous catalysts can lower greenhouse gas emissions and generate alternative, liquid fuels. The most common commercial catalyst for CO2 reduction to methanol is Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, where ZnO improves conversion and selectivity toward methanol. The structure of this catalyst is thought to be Zn oxy(hydroxyl) overlayers at the nanometer scale on Cu. In the presence of CO2 and H2 under reaction conditions, the Cu substrate itself can be restructured and/or partially oxidized at its interface with ZnO, or the Zn might be reduced, possibly completely to a CuZn alloy, making the exact structure and stoichiometry of the active site a topic of active debate. In this study, we examine Zn3 clusters on Cu(100) and Cu(111), as a sub-nano model of the catalyst. We use a grand canonical genetic algorithm to sample the system structure and stoichiometry under catalytic conditions: T = 550 K, initial partial pressures of H2 = 4.5 atm and CO2 = 0.5 atm, and 1% conversion. We uncover a strong dependence of the catalyst stoichiometry on surface coverage. At the optimal 0.2 ML surface coverage, chains of Zn(OH) form on both Cu surfaces. On Cu(100), the catalyst has many thermally accessible metastable minima, whereas on Cu(111), it does not. No oxidation or reconstruction of the Cu is found. However, at lower coverage of Zn, Zn3 clusters take on a metallic form on Cu(100), and slightly oxidized Zn3O on Cu(111), while the surface uptakes H to form a variety of low hydrides of Cu. We thus hypothesize that the reason the 0.2 ML Zn coverage is optimal, as found experimentally, is the stronger yet incomplete oxidation afforded by Zn at this coverage.</description>

      <title>On the electrochemical CO2 reduction by Bi-based catalysts: single
  crystals or mixture phases</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2409.11648</link>

                Metallic bismuth is both non-toxic and cost-effective. Bi-based catalysts have demonstrated the ability to efficiently produce HCOOH through CO2RR while effectively inhibiting the HER. Although many experiments have been reported concerning its performance towards CO2 reduction, the impact its valence states and crystal faces on CO2RR selectivity (e.g. HCOOH versus CO) it still under debate. Here, we performed a comprehensive study via density functional theory, by including three typical valence states of Bi, such as 0 (Bi), +3 (Bi2O3) and +5 (Bi2O5), as well as their often-studied crystal facets. The results show that metallic Bi demonstrates a poor selectivity for HCOOH, but boasts a higher conversion rate for CO2. While Bi2O3 exhibits a good selectivity for HCOOH production, yet it displays a lower conversion rate for CO2. For Bi2O5, all studied surfaces show high energy barriers in both cases of HCOOH and CO production, and lower energy barriers for HER reactions, indicating that Bi at +5 valence state is not the good choice for 2e transfer reactions. Subsequently, we further examined the effects of oxygen contents on the selectivity of HCOOH and the conversion rate for CO2. Interestingly, we found that partial oxidization of Bi benefits both the selectivity and the conversion rate. With these observations, we suggest that a mixture of Bi (0) and Bi2O3 (+3) phases would be a better choice than single crystals for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Ethane-oxidising archaea couple CO2 generation to F420 reduction</title>

                Abstract The anaerobic oxidation of alkanes is a microbial process that mitigates the flux of hydrocarbon seeps into the oceans. In marine archaea, the process depends on sulphate-reducing bacterial partners to exhaust electrons, and it is generally assumed that the archaeal CO 2 -forming enzymes (CO dehydrogenase and formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase) are coupled to ferredoxin reduction. Here, we study the molecular basis of the CO 2 -generating steps of anaerobic ethane oxidation by characterising native enzymes of the thermophile Candidatus Ethanoperedens thermophilum obtained from microbial enrichment. We perform biochemical assays and solve crystal structures of the CO dehydrogenase and formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase complexes, showing that both enzymes deliver electrons to the F 420 cofactor. Both multi-metalloenzyme harbour electronic bridges connecting CO and formylmethanofuran oxidation centres to a bound flavin-dependent F 420 reductase. Accordingly, both systems exhibit robust coupled F 420 -reductase activities, which are not detected in the cell extract of related methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. Based on the crystal structures, enzymatic activities, and metagenome mining, we propose a model in which the catabolic oxidising steps would wire electron delivery to F 420 in this organism. Via this specific adaptation, the indirect electron transfer from reduced F 420 to the sulphate-reducing partner would fuel energy conservation and represent the driving force of ethanotrophy.</description>

      <title>Graphene-Based Single-Atom Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: Unraveling the Roles of Metals and Dopants in Tuning Activity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-gm3h4</link>
      <description>Colin Gallagher, Manish Kothakonda, Qing Zhao, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403649311

                Discovering electrocatalysts that can efficiently convert carbon dioxide (CO2) to valuable fuels and feedstocks using excess renewable electricity is an emergent carbon-neutral technology. A single metal atom embedded in doped graphene, i.e., single-atom catalyst (SAC), possesses high activity and selectivity for electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to CO, yet further reduction to hydrocarbons is challenging. Here, using density functional theory calculations, we investigate stability and reactivity of a broad SAC chemical space with various metal centers (3d transition metals) and dopants (2p dopants of B, N, O; 3p dopants of P, S) as electrocatalysts for CO2R to methane and methanol. We observe that the rigidities of these SACs depend on the type of dopants, with 3p-coordinating SACs exhibiting more severe out-of-plane distortion than 2p-coordinating SACs. Using CO adsorption energy as a descriptor for CO2R reactivity, we narrow down the candidates and identify seven SACs with near-optimal CO binding strength. We then elucidate full reaction mechanisms towards methane and methanol generation on these identified candidates and observe highly dopant-dependent activity and rate-limiting steps, divergent from conventional mechanistic understanding on metallic surfaces, calling into question whether previous design principles established on metals are directly transferrable to SACs. Consequently, we find that zinc embedded in boron-doped graphene (Zn-B-C) is a highly active catalyst for electrochemical CO2R to C1 hydrocarbons. Our work reveals the opportunities of tuning SAC reactivity via engineering dopants and metals and highlights the importance of re-elucidating CO2R reaction mechanisms on SACs towards unearthing new design principles for SAC chemistry.</description>

      <title>Economic Analysis of Advanced Ultra-Supercritical Pulverized Coal Power Plants: A Cost-Effective CO2 Emission Reduction Option?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.31399/asm.cp.am-epri-2010p0053</link>
      <description>Jeffrey N. Phillips, John Wheeldon, No host. 84659(None)] 2010. https://openalex.org/W4403683768

                Abstract A recent engineering design study conducted by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) has compared the cost and performance of an advanced ultra-supercritical (A-USC) pulverized coal (PC) power plant with main steam temperature of 700&#176;C to that of conventional coal-fired power plant designs: sub-critical, supercritical, and current USC PC plants with main steam temperatures of 541&#176;, 582&#176;, and 605&#176;C, respectively. The study revealed that for a US location in the absence of any cost being imposed for CO2 emissions the A-USC design was a slightly more expensive choice for electricity production. However, when the marginal cost of the A-USC design is compared to the reduction in CO2 emissions, it was shown that the cost of the avoided CO2 emissions was less than $25 per metric ton of CO2. This is significantly lower than any technology currently being considered for CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Additionally by lowering CO2/MWh, the A-USC plant also lowers the cost of CCS once integrated with the power plant. It is therefore concluded that A-USC technology should be considered as one of the primary options for minimizing the cost of reducing CO2 emissions from future coal power plants.</description>

                Homogeneous electrocatalysts typified by transition&#8208;metal complex show transcendent potency in efficient energy catalysis through molecular design. For example, metal complexes with elaborate design performed wonderful activity and selectivity for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Primary coordination sphere of metal complexes plays a key role in regulating its intrinsic redox properties and catalytic activity. However, the overall reduction efficiency of CO2 is also bound up with the substrate activation process. Transition&#8208;metal complexes are hoped to exhibit reasonable redox potential, reactive activity, and stability, while binding and activating CO2 molecules to achieve efficient CO2 reduction. Construction of second coordination sphere, especially hydrogen&#8208;bonding network of transition metal complexes, is reported to be the &#8220;kill two birds with one stone&#8221; strategy to realize efficient CO2 reduction catalysis via systematic catalyst properties modulation and substrate activation. Herein, we present recent progress on the construction of hydrogen&#8208;bonding network in the second coordination sphere of metal complexes by ligand modification or the introduction of exogenous organic ligand, and the resulted productive enhancement of the catalytic performance of metal complexes by the improvement of adsorption capacity and activation of CO2, proton transfer rate, and stability of reaction intermediates, etc.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of Water Content in Solvent Systems on Photochemical CO2 Reduction Catalyzed by Ruthenium Complexes</title>

                To achieve artificial photosynthesis, it is crucial to develop a catalytic system for CO2 reduction using water as the electron source. However, photochemical CO2 reduction by homogeneous molecular catalysts has predominantly been conducted in organic solvents. This study investigates the impact of water content on catalytic activity in photochemical CO2 reduction in N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), using [Ru(bpy)3]2+ (bpy: 2,2&#8242;-bipyridine) as a photosensitizer, 1-benzyl-1,4-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH) as an electron donor, and two ruthenium diimine carbonyl complexes, [Ru(bpy)2(CO)2]2+ and trans(Cl)-[Ru(Ac-5Bpy-NHMe)(CO)2Cl2] (5Bpy: 5&#8242;-amino-2,2&#8242;-bipyridine-5-carboxylic acid), as catalysts. Increasing water content significantly decreased CO and formic acid production. The similar rates of decrease for both catalysts suggest that water primarily affects the formation efficiency of free one-electron-reduced [Ru(bpy)3]2+, rather than the intrinsic catalytic activity. The reduction in cage-escape efficiency with higher water content underscores the challenges in replacing organic solvents with water in photochemical CO2 reduction.</description>

      <title>The Role of Low-Carbon Fuels and Carbon Capture in Decarbonizing the U.S. Clinker Manufacturing for Cement Production: CO2 Emissions Reduction Potentials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17205233</link>
      <description>Ikenna J. Okeke, Dipti Kamath, Sachin Nimbalkar, Joseph Cresko, Energies. 17(20)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403602833

                Low-carbon fuels, feedstocks, and energy sources can play a vital role in the decarbonization of clinker production in cement manufacturing. Fuel switching with renewable natural gas, green hydrogen, and biomass can provide a low-carbon energy source for the high-temperature process heat during the pyroprocessing steps of clinker production. However, up to 60% of CO2 emissions from clinker production are attributable to process-related CO2 emissions, which will need the simultaneous implementation of other decarbonization technologies, such as carbon capture. To evaluate the potential of fuel switching and carbon capture technologies in decarbonizing the cement industry, a study of the facility-level CO2 emissions is necessary. This study evaluates the potential for using a single low-carbon fuel as an energy source in clinker production for cement manufacturing compared to conventional clinker production (which uses a range of fuel mixes). In addition, conventional carbon capture (operated with natural gas-based steam for solvent regeneration) and electrified carbon capture configurations were designed and assessed for net-zero emission targets. Carbon emissions reductions with and without biogenic emissions credits were analyzed to ascertain their impact on the overall carbon accounting. Results show that carbon emissions intensity of cement can vary from 571 to 784 kgCO2eq/metric ton of cement without carbon capture and from 166.33 to 438.66 kgCO2eq/metric ton of cement with carbon capture. We find that when biogenic carbon credits are considered, cement production with a sustainably grown biomass as fuel source coupled with conventional carbon capture can lead to a net-negative emission cement (&#8722;271 kgCO2eq/metric ton of cement), outperforming an electrified capture design (35 kgCO2eq/metric ton of cement). The carbon accounting for the Scope 1, 2, and biogenic emissions conducted in this study is aimed at helping researchers and industry partners in the cement and concrete sector make an informed decision on the choice of fuel and decarbonization strategy to adopt.</description>

      <title>Water-induced Switching in Selectivity and Steric Control of Activity in Photochemical CO2 Reduction Catalyzed by RhCp*(bpy) Derivatives</title>

                Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) was investigated in either organic or aqueous/organic media by employing three water-soluble [RhIIICp*(LH2)Cl]+ (LH2 = n,n&#8217;-dihydroxy-2,2&#8217;-bipyridine; n = 4, 5, or 6) in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH) and triethanolamine (TEOA). Through studying the electron-donating effects of two hydroxyl groups introduced to the bipyridyl ligand, we found that the substituent positions greatly affect both the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in CO2 reduction. More importantly, the HCOOH selectivity shows a dramatic increase from 14% to 83% upon switching the solvent media from pure organic to aqueous/organic mixture, where the H2 selectivity shows a reverse phenomenon. The enhanced HCOOH selectivity and the drastic decrease in the H2 yield are well rationalized by the fact that the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is not only driven photochemically via the attack of RhIII(H)Cp*(LH2-&#8226;) on CO2 but also partly bypassed by a dark H2 addition reaction yielding [RhIII(H)Cp*(L)]- from [RhIIICp*(L)Cl]+, which was also separately investigated under the dark conditions. Combination of experimental and theoretical approaches were made to clarify the pKa values of catalyst intermediates together with the abundant species responsible for the major catalytic processes. Our DFT studies unveil that the exceptionally large structural strain given by the steric contacts between the 6,6&#8217;-dihydroxyl groups and the Cp* moiety plays a significant role in bringing about an outstanding catalytic performance of the 6,6&#8217;-subsituted derivative. The intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were carried out to clarify the mechanism of hydride transfer steps leading to generate formate together the heterolytic H2 cleavage steps leading to afford the key hydridorhodium intermediates. This study represents the first report on the water-induced high selectivity in CO2-to-HCOOH conversion, shedding a new light on the strategy to control the efficiency and selectivity in the catalysis of CO2 reduction.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the synergistic potential of 2D&#8208;2D nanosheet based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction: Cooperative boosting of CO2 reduction to solar fuel and biomass valorization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202401657</link>
      <description>Shivali Dhingra, Ayushi Jain, Arpna Jaryal, Chandan Bera, Kamalakannan Kailasam, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403612276

                Harnessing inexhaustible solar energy for CO2 valorization is substantial step toward achieving carbon&#8208;neutral energy cycle. However, CO2 conversion often exhibits slow kinetics, necessitating the utilization of sacrificial agents making the process economically unfeasible. In the ongoing quest for sustainable and economically feasible CO2 valorization, herein the photoreduction of CO2 to CO coupled with biomass&#8208;based alcohol oxidation to fine chemicals is reported via Bi2WO6/g&#8208;C3N4 (BWO/g&#8208;CN) 2D&#8208;2D nanosheet based S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. Importantly, BWO/g&#8208;CN&#8208;60 exhibits highest photocatalytic activity with CO production rate of 6.87 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, accompanied by &gt;98% selectivity and selective oxidation of veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde, with notable yield of 42% in 6 h under simulated solar light. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) of 14.3% is achieved for CO production at the wavelength of 420 nm. Additionally, the formed heterostructure results in enhanced charge separation and accelerated charge transfer kinetics as validated by PL, EIS, and photocurrent studies. EPR, 13CO2 labeling, DFT studies, and various controlled experiments provided deeper insight into the mechanism of underlying photo&#8208;redox process. Thus, the current study presents a sustainable paradigm for CO2 mitigation by converting it into solar fuel, while synergistically producing the fine chemicals through effectively harnessing the full potential of charge carriers.</description>

      <title>Balancing Progress and Preservation: The Complex Interplay of Economic Growth and Forest Conservation in Nepal&#8217;s Carbon Dioxide Emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/7562668</link>
      <description>Omkar Poudel, Pradeep Acharya, Sarad Chandra Kafle, Basanta Prasad Adhikari, Discrete Dynamics in Nature and Society. 2024(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403700992

                The intricate relationship between economic growth, environmental quality, and energy consumption has been extensively debated and studied on a global scale. The impacts of ecological quality on economic growth have been observed to be both positive and negative, particularly about human health as a result of pollutant emissions. It is essential to examine the compatibility between economic growth and environmental improvement, particularly through the reduction of emissions. This study aimed to investigate the connection between economic growth in forested areas and the corresponding impact on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Nepal (Rose and Fisher, 1970). The analysis utilized time series data from 1990 to 2020, employing the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) method. The DOLS results demonstrated a positive and statistically significant relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions (Shafik and Bandyopadhyay, 1992). Specifically, an increase of Rs. 10 million in gross domestic product (GDP) corresponded to a 0.6112 kiloton increase in CO2 emissions. In contrast, the long&#8208;term coefficient for forested areas exhibited a substantial association, indicating that a reduction of one square kilometer of forested area (deforestation) resulted in an increase of 68.37 kilotons in CO2 emissions in Nepal. These findings accentuate the divergent effects of economic progress and deforestation on carbon emissions in Nepal, with GDP growth contributing to a greater increase in emissions. Therefore, the implementation of effective strategies and economic measures, such as afforestation and reforestation, forest protection, sustainable forest management, and mechanisms like REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation plus), can play a vital role in mitigating carbon emissions while simultaneously addressing deforestation and ensuring long&#8208;term economic progress in Nepal.</description>

                Optimizing the binding energy between the intermediate and the active site is a key factor for tuning catalytic product selectivity and activity in the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction. Copper active sites are known to reduce CO2 to hydrocarbons and oxygenates, but suffer from poor product selectivity due to the moderate binding energies of several of the reaction intermediates. Here, we report an ion exchange strategy to construct Cu&#8208;Pd paddle wheel dimers within Cu&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), [Cu3&#8208;xPdx(BTC)2] (BTC = benzentricarboxylate), without altering the overall MOF structural properties. Compared to the pristine Cu MOF ([Cu3(BTC)2], HKUST&#8208;1), the Cu&#8208;Pd MOF shifts CO2 electroreduction products from diverse chemical species to selective CO generation. In situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis of the catalyst oxidation state and local geometry, combined with theoretical calculations, reveal that the incorporation of Pd within the Cu&#8208;Pd paddle wheel node structure of the MOF promotes adsorption of the key intermediate COOH* at the Cu site. This permits CO&#8208;selective catalytic mechanisms and thus advances our understanding of the interplay between structure and activity toward electrochemical CO2 reduction using molecular catalysts.</description>

                Objective: This study proposes a model aimed at estimating and reducing carbon emissions in sugarcane cultivation and juice extraction, designed for potential application in real-world systems. Method: The model grounded in a hypothetical case study of a 60-hectare sugarcane plantation in a warm climate with a 7-month growth cycle and a three-year simulation period, focuses on estimate and evaluate mitigation scenarios to decrease emissions from fuel and electricity usage in activities such as plowing, sowing, harvesting, and irrigation. Utilizing Vensim PLE, a System Dynamics model that combine event and dynamic simulation. Results and Discussion: Utilizing Vensim PLE, a System Dynamics model that combine event and dynamic simulation estimated a 3060.81 tons CO2 equivalent carbon footprint. Two scenarios aimed at footprint reduction were tested: substituting electrical energy with solar power reduced the footprint by 86% to 450.092 tons, demonstrating clean energy's efficacy. Conversely, replacing an industrial mill with the traditional trapiche technique for juice extraction yielded a mere 1% reduction, indicating its ineffectiveness for real-world application. Research Implications: This study emphasizes the development of a simulation model based on system dynamics to estimate the carbon footprint emissions in sugar cane production considering its cultivation and juice extraction. The results support that through simulations, it is possible to determine the factors that influence the generation of carbon dioxide, offering a broader vision to establish and implement mitigation measures such as adopting clean energies and reducing fuel consumption. Originality/Value: This research contributes to the understanding of the application of system dynamics by using software such as Vensim PLE to estimate the carbon footprint emissions in sugar cane production, considering its cultivation and juice extraction. The results found through simulations suggest the implementation of mitigation measures such as the adoption of clean energies and the reduction of fuel consumption.</description>

      <title>Reaching machine learning leverage to advance performance of electrocatalytic CO2 conversion in non-aqueous deep eutectic electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-74893-5</link>
      <description>Ahmed Halilu, Mohamed Kamel Hadj-Kali, Hanee F. Hizaddin, Mohd Ali Hashim, Emad Ali, Suresh K. Bhargava, Scientific Reports. 14(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403601943

                Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) show promise for future electrochemical systems due to their adjustable buffer capacities. This study utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyse the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) in DEEs with a buffer capacity of approximately 10.21 mol/pH. The objective is to minimize undesired hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and render CO2RR dominant in a membrane cell. The CO2RR process was found to be non-adiabatic, as the time of nuclear motion for CO32&#8722; in K2CO3 product, through CO2&#9679;&#8722; trapping, is 0.368 femtoseconds shorter than the 1.856 &#215; 10&#8722;3s charge transfer relaxation time. Microkinetic analysis reveals that the rate of CO2RR to CO2&#9679;&#8722; is 2.14 &#215; 103 mol/cm2/s2 with a rate constant of 2.1 &#215; 1010 cm/s. Our findings demonstrate that ensemble and k-Nearest Neighbours algorithms learn the CO2RR dataset, achieving a prediction accuracy of over 99%. The models were verified visually and quantitatively by overlaying predicted and experimental dataset. Diagnostic and SHAP analyses highlighted the gradient boost ensemble algorithm, predicting asymptotic current densities of -4.114 mA/cm2 or -13.340 mA/cm2, with high turnover frequencies (TOF) of 3.79 &#215; 1010 h-1 or 12.30 &#215; 1010 h-1 for CO2&#9679;&#8722; or K2CO3 generation on silver electrodes, respectively. These results consider both accuracy and robustness against overfitting, providing an opportunity to optimize future non-aqueous electrolytes for convenient TOF measurements at industrially relevant current densities.</description>

                Abstract Background As a significant contributor to secondary energy production, the power generation industry has a considerable reliance on fossil fuels. It is a significant source of atmospheric pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, making it a key target for emission reduction in environmental protection. This study is focused on the power generation industry in Anhui Province, China. The LMDI decomposition model and the LEAP model are employed to establish five emission reduction scenarios, which were used to forecast future trends in carbon dioxide and air pollutant emissions in the power generation sector from 2022 to 2035. Results The results indicate that the implementation of comprehensive measures for the promotion of washed coal technology, improvements in thermal power efficiency, and the substitution of clean energy, carbon dioxide, and atmospheric pollutants will reach their peak in 2027, achieving the most optimal emission reduction effects. The analysis of the synergistic emission reduction effects demonstrates that the implementation of comprehensive measures yields the most optimal reduction in carbon dioxide and atmospheric pollutants. Furthermore, the comprehensive scenario exhibits a considerable emission reduction contribution rate. Conclusions For the power generation industry in Anhui Province, the simultaneous implementation of three emission reduction measures represents the optimal path for synergistic improvement in pollution reduction and carbon reduction. These measures provide policy recommendations for the power generation industry in other regions seeking to achieve pollution and carbon reduction.</description>

      <title>Carbon dioxide injection into the Achimov formations using reinjection technology by the example of Ach3-4 formation in the Novo-Urengoy area of the Urengoy field</title>

                The prerequisites for the study are the calculation results for the cycling process, where carbon dioxide is proposed as the injection agent into the Achimov formations instead of dry gas, with the goal of increasing the condensate recovery factor. The work is focused on the efficiency assessment of carbon dioxide reinjection technology and reducing carbon footprint at a late stage of field development. The research object is the &#1040;ch 3-4 formation within the Novo-Urengoy license area of the Urengoy field. The leading method to identify this problem is the results of the full-scale composite dynamic model in the ECLIPSE 300 format. The model takes into account the history of field development on depletion. The articles deals with two schemes for injecting carbon dioxide into the formation. In the first scheme, pure carbon dioxide is injected in a closed-loop system, but carbon neutrality through storage is not achieved. In the second scheme, carbon dioxide is injected using reinjection technology. Once injection begins, gas production stops. Only the condensate separated from the formation gas during low-temperature separation is sold and sent for further processing. After allocation of the condensate, the mixture of natural gas and carbon dioxide, in a specific proportion, is sent to the compressor station for reinjection into the formation in a gaseous state. Injecting pure carbon dioxide achieves a condensate recovery factor similar to that of gas injection with a 30 % carbon dioxide mixture. However, this option is less economically viable compared to the base and other scenarios due to high capital costs for upgrading the existing gas processing equipment (requiring the construction of an amine treatment unit). With carbon dioxide injection using reinjection technology, in addition to recovering extra condensate that had condensed during natural depletion, a reduction in the carbon footprint is also achieved. To maximize the condensate recovery factor, the optimal concentration of carbon dioxide in the injection mixture has been determined. The optimal timing for the start of injection was identified to maximize gas recovery. Economic efficiency is expected from the additional recovery of condensate trapped in the reservoir and from achieving carbon neutrality through the monetization and storage of carbon dioxide.</description>

                Under China's dual carbon goals, it is imperative for enterprises to effectively reduce carbon emissions while achieving pollutant reduction. This article explores the potential role of government-implemented digital governance in facilitating these objectives. Utilizing a quasi-natural experiment on digital governance, we established an analytical framework to thoroughly examine how digital governance can help Chinese enterprises realize synergistic effects in pollution control and carbon reduction. Our study reveals that digital governance significantly reduces enterprises' emissions of carbon dioxide and pollutants, with emission intensities of the carbon dioxide, air pollutant and water pollutant being decreased by approximately 6.9%, 7.3%, and 7.0%, respectively. These reductions are primarily driven by improvements in energy efficiency, the promotion of green innovation, digital transformation, and enhanced role of media. However, it is important to note that digital governance also negatively impacts overall corporate productivity and widens the digital divide between large and small-to-medium enterprises. The research results have practical significance for promoting the achievement of emission reduction goals and sustainable development for enterprises.</description>

      <title>Global Cooperation for Reducing Carbon Emissions: the Role of Carbon Taxes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.61093/fmir.8(3).69-79.2024</link>
      <description>Masaaki Yoshimori, Financial Markets Institutions and Risks. 8(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403736660

                As the world grapples with the challenges of climate change, international cooperation and effective policy tools are crucial for reducing carbon emissions and achieving a sustainable future. This study uses a game-theoretical approach to investigate the negotiations between countries with high and low carbon dioxide emissions, with the goal of achieving zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. By fostering collaboration and understanding among nations, game theory provides a robust framework for addressing the complexities of global climate policy. Game theory provides a mathematical framework to model strategic behaviors in climate negotiations between high and low carbon dioxide-emitting countries. By analyzing the payoff functions, the Nash equilibrium strategies for emission reduction efforts are derived. The introduction of a carbon tax increases the marginal cost of emissions, leading to higher equilibrium efforts by both country groups. Simulation results indicate a significant increase in emission reductions with the tax, demonstrating the tax&#8217;s effectiveness in incentivizing climate action and contributing to global mitigation efforts. This result highlights the potential economic benefits of carbon taxation, including innovation incentives and reduced emissions, which can drive sustainable economic growth and job creation. However, the study also acknowledges potential costs, such as impacts on economic competitiveness and distributional fairness, which must be carefully considered and addressed in policy design. This research offers valuable insights for policymakers, highlighting the importance of crafting carbon tax policies that maximize environmental benefits while minimizing adverse economic and social effects. By balancing these considerations, policymakers can develop more effective strategies that support both environmental sustainability and economic resilience.</description>

                Abstract Many ports serve ships on a first-come-first-serve (FCFS) basis leading to negative environmental impacts due to ships &#8220;hurrying up to wait&#8221; if berths are not ready forcing them to idle at anchorage. Besides the fuel consumption used at elevated speed to be in good time in the port area, average anchorage times can account for 5 &#8722; 10% of ship voyage durations during which ships still emit carbon dioxide (CO2) while running auxiliary engines consuming ca. 15% of the voyage&#8217;s marine fuel. Ships deciding to skip or reshuffle port calls due to this might enforce this practice which can result into overall uncertainty, unbalanced port resource utilization including congestion and logjams rippling entire industries. Congested port areas complicate traffic management of arriving and leaving ships. The need to establish a comprehensive system for managing arrivals and departures becomes even more pressing in the case of damaged ships or accidents. Besides, early communicating terminal and port readiness notices allows ships to adjust their speed and save fuel of up to 21% of the overall voyage. Information technological advances made great progress by optimizing individual ship voyages. However, the optimization of cargo transport within a system which can also take into account real-time safety levels of ships, is still unsolved. In this paper, we review past research on just-in-time (JIT) port call optimization (PCO), its challenges, and its way forward through digitalization efforts to achieve desperately needed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions.</description>

                Climate change is a global concern driven by greenhouse gas emissions. Bangladesh, being densely populated and a significant carbon emitter, must urgently reduce its &#8220;carbon-dioxide emissions&#8221;. The primary objectives of this research are to meticulously examine the impact of green growth, non-renewable energy, renewable energy, and technological innovations on carbon dioxide emissions in Bangladesh from 1990 to 2020, with the goal of informing policies for effective and sustainable climate change mitigation in Bangladesh. The analysis using advanced econometric methods, including autoregressive distributed lag, fully modified ordinary least squares, and canonical cointegration regression, reveals that green growth and technological innovations have adverse long-term but positive short-term effects on carbon emissions in Bangladesh. Additionally, it is noteworthy that both non-renewable and renewable energy sources significantly contribute to long-term and short-term carbon emissions. The study confirms the Environmental Kuznets Curve, showing a &#8220;&#8745;&#8221; shaped relationship between green development and carbon emissions. Policymakers should prioritize green growth, incentivize technological innovation, promote sustainable economic practices, and implement comprehensive energy transition strategies. The insights from this study inform policy formulation to address the complex relationships between green growth, energy sources, and carbon-dioxide emissions for sustainable climate change mitigation in Bangladesh. Bangladesh&#8217;s efforts contribute to global emission reduction and foster a resilient future.</description>

                As global climate change intensifies, countries face serious challenges. In response to this issue, various industries are actively promoting green development and energy conservation measures, with the electricity sector being particularly important. As a major emitter of carbon dioxide, China&#8217;s construction of transmission infrastructure has a significant impact on global climate change. In this context, research on energy conservation and emission reduction measures is urgently needed. Taking the 500 kV transmission project in Jiande, Zhejiang Province as an example, this study analyzes its carbon emissions in detail and quantifies the effects of 18 energy conservation and emission reduction measures. The results show that adopting energy conservation and emission reduction technologies can significantly reduce carbon emissions, especially in terms of raw materials and equipment. However, there are still issues such as data gaps and unclear quantification methods that need further research and improvement. Therefore, it is recommended to continue researching energy conservation and emission reduction technologies, establish relevant standards, and promote the development of more environmentally friendly raw materials and equipment by power enterprises to facilitate the green and low-carbon development of transmission engineering.</description>

      <title>The Present Net Impact Value for the Atmospheric Emission of Forest Carbon from Harvested Wood Products</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s10666-024-10009-7</link>

                Abstract With emerging issues of global climate change, it is clear that there is value in controlling the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Managing the release or uptake of carbon by forests is an important opportunity to yield reductions in atmospheric CO 2 , and this includes managing the amount of harvested forest carbon that is stored in harvested wood products (HWP). To evaluate the contribution of forest carbon to climate change, we need to evaluate how much carbon is released to the atmosphere, when it is released, how long the released C remains in the atmosphere, and our preference for the timing and amplitude of climate change. When forest is harvested, the subsequent amount of carbon in the atmosphere depends on the processes and efficiency of harvest, the life times of the forest products, and the treatment of forest products at the end of their useful lifetime. This paper assembles extensive US data on the fractions of forest carbon that are released to the atmosphere during the processing of a forest harvest and the production and life expectancy of harvested wood products (HWP). Using a model of the global carbon cycle and an illustrated treatment of time preference, we calculate the relative cost of different forest management scenarios in terms of the ton years of CO 2 in the atmosphere. We show that delaying the emission of one ton of C as CO 2 for 1 year yields a reduction of 41.74 ton years of carbon in the atmosphere when integrated to infinite time and using a low time preference of 1% per year. Alternate scenarios of forest harvest and product management can be compared against this scenario to compare their relative impact on global climate change.</description>

                Single-atom catalysts (SACs) of copper dispersed in anatase TiO2 (Cu/TiO2) have attracted significant attention in various sustainable chemical processes, including water splitting, carbon monoxide oxidation, carbon dioxide reduction, chemical synthesis, and advanced oxidation processes for water treatment. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in these processes, but a mechanistic understanding of ROS generation on Cu/TiO2 SAC surfaces has not been established. Combining experimental investigation and computational simulation, this work provides unequivocal evidence for superoxide radical anion (O2&#8226;&#8211;) formation via reduction of the adsorbed oxygen by Cu+ and hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) production by oxidation of lattice oxygen within the bridging Cu-O-Ti structure on the SAC surface. The superior performance of the SAC has been demonstrated through its organic dye degradation, bactericidal activity, and biofilm disruption, indicating its wide applicability in water treatment and disinfection. The results and the methodologies will benefit the wide field of heterogeneous redox chemistry.</description>

                Abstract The oil and gas industry in Brunei is increasingly focused on sustainable practices, particularly in well cementing, which is a crucial operation with environmental considerations. To contribute to this effort, the service company has introduced a novel reduced Portland cement (RPC) blend system. This system incorporates locally sourced fly ash, which provides a high-performance and environmentally responsible solution that aligns with the commitment to sustainable development. The RPC system prioritizes environmental stewardship with a decrease in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with clinker production through a 25% reduction in Class G Portland cement content. Additionally, the system uses readily available fly ash, a recycled material, to minimize reliance on imported ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and strengthen supply chain efficiency. This focus on localization not only reduces transportation emissions but also fosters a more adaptable and resilient supply network in Brunei. Rigorous laboratory tests have qualified the RPC blend system and have demonstrated that RPC blends maintain or even exceed the compressive strength of conventional, higher-density OPC systems. This helps ensure effective wellbore isolation, despite the lower density of the RPC blend, a crucial factor for long-term well integrity. Additionally, RPC blends exhibit lower equivalent circulating densities, which makes pressure management during wellbore construction simpler and enhances operational efficiency. The RPC system provides several advantages beyond its environmental benefits. The enhanced ductility and toughness of these blends, compared to traditional cement, allow the cement sheath to better withstand downhole stresses and strain throughout the well's life. This promotes long-term zonal isolation and helps mitigate the potential risk of leakage. Furthermore, the lower permeability of RPC blends provides superior resistance to corrosive fluid and gas that migrate through the wellbore to help ensure the long-term integrity and production efficiency of the well. Since May 2023, the RPC blend system has been successfully implemented in Brunei. This innovative approach not only minimizes the environmental impact but also delivers strong wellbore integrity. The RPC blend system represents a significant advancement in sustainable well cement operations, which paves the way for a more environmentally acceptable future for the oil and gas industry in Brunei.</description>

                Abstract A three-year field study was conducted to investigate the CO2 emissions from irrigation wheat fields in response to biochar addition and nitrogen optimizing. Eight treatments were established: (1) control (without any fertilizers or biochar addition, CK), (2) nitrogen fertilizer application alone (300kg/hm2, N1), (3) biochar application alone (20t/hm2, B), (4) nitrogen fertilizer applied with biochar (N1B), (5) nitrogen fertilizer applied with 15% reduction (255kg/hm2, N2), (6) 15% reduction of nitrogen fertilizer + biochar (N2B), (7) nitrogen fertilizer applied with 30% reduction (210kg/hm2, N3), and (8) 30% reduction of nitrogen fertilizer + biochar (N3B), each treatment has three replicates. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of biochar addition and nitrogen optimized levels on soil carbon dioxide emission, soil organic carbon and microbial community. The findings indicated that the application of biochar and/or nitrogen fertilizer, particularly in combination, was observed to increase soil organic carbon and soil active organic carbon. Biochar application decreased CO2 emissions in wheat fields, compared with the non-amendment treatment. Biochar addition combined with optimized nitrogen also make a different CO2 emission rate. This improvement was attributed to the capacity of biochar to regulate soil microbial community composition, like soil functional diversity, soil microorganisms (fungi and bacterial), soil properties (pH, soil bulk density). In conclusion, biochar addition with nitrogen optimizing (B1N2) regime was determined to be the optimal approach for wheat field in irrigated region northern Xinjiang, resulting in enhanced soil organic carbon and the mitigation of carbon emissions. Nevertheless, further investigation of its long-term impact on farmland is recommended.</description>

                Abstract Reconstruction of catalysts is now well recognized as a common phenomenon in electrocatalysis. As the reconstructed structure may promote or hamper the electrochemical performance, how to achieve the designed active surface for highly enhanced catalytic activity through the reconstruction needs to be carefully investigated. In this review, the genesis and electrochemical effects of reconstruction in various electrochemical catalytic processes, such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), and nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) are first described. Then, the strategies for optimizing the reconstruction, such as valence states control, active phase retention, phase evolution engineering, and surface poisoning prevention are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the general rules of reconstruction optimization are summarized and give perspectives for future study. It is believed that the review shall provide deep insights into electrocatalytic mechanisms and guide the design of pre&#8208;catalysts with highly improved activity.</description>

      <title>Climate mitigation potential of natural climate solutions and clean energy on The Nature Conservancy properties in California, USA</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0311195</link>

                Natural climate solutions (NCS) and transitioning to clean energy can reduce greenhouse gases and contribute to mitigating climate change. Private landowners with large holdings, such as conservation organizations like The Nature Conservancy, have set ambitious goals to reduce net emissions and increase sequestration on their lands by implementing NCS. We assessed the potential carbon dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) reduction from feasible NCS, specifically implementing new restoration and agricultural management activities, and transitions to clean energy on The Nature Conservancy, California chapter&#8217;s fee-owned and conservation easement properties. We compared the total CO2e reduction from potential new NCS activities to the impact from ongoing NCS activities, the chapter&#8217;s 2030 goal, and the state&#8217;s reduction goal for natural and working lands to understand how the organization can contribute to climate mitigation. We found that implementing NCS on 37 fee-owned properties (63,175 MTCO2e year &#8211;1) and clean energy on 10 fee-owned properties (488 MTCO2e year &#8211;1) combined would not reach the chapter&#8217;s 2030 goal (72,000 MTCO 2 e year &#8211;1), and there can be tradeoffs between maximizing CO2e reduction and protecting conservation values. However, ongoing changes to forest management on a single conservation easement property, where another non-profit harvests timber and sells carbon credits, currently contributes 147,749 MTCO2e year &#8211;1, more than two times the 2030 goal and representing 7.4% of the state&#8217;s annual goal. Our results suggest that The Nature Conservancy, California chapter would need to implement NCS on some of the conservation easements or consider future land protection deals with carbon rich ecosystems or high impact NCS to reach their CO2e reduction goal.</description>

                CO2-soluble surfactant foam systems have garnered significant attention in the fields of enhanced oil and gas recovery, environmental protection, and greenhouse gas emission reduction. This review provides a comprehensive explanation of the basic theory of CO2-soluble surfactant foam, the mechanism of enhanced oil recovery, and the classification and application of various CO2-soluble surfactants.The mechanism of enhanced oil recovery by CO2-soluble surfactant foam involves the effective reduction of CO2 fluidity, the decrease in oil-air flow ratio, and the stabilization of the displacement front. Foam plays a vital role in mitigating the issues of channeling and gravity separation often caused by simple CO2 injection. The reduction in gas fluidity can be attributed to the increase in apparent viscosity and trapped gas fraction.Future research should prioritize the development of more efficient and environmentally-friendly CO2-soluble surfactants. It is essential to further explore the advantages and challenges associated with their practical applications in order to maximize their potential impact.</description>

                This study analyzes the variability of carbon dioxide emissions across Asia, revealing that China, India, and Indonesia are the primary contributors with extremely high average emissions and standard deviations. The GSTAR(3;1,1,1) model has been shown to be optimal for forecasting future emissions, based on lower RMSE and MAPE values. Ordinary Kriging analysis using the isotropic spherical semivariogram model provides the most accurate predictions for unobserved areas, with contour maps indicating that the northeastern region of Asia will continue to face high emission concentrations until 2027. While countries such as Brunei and Armenia have managed to keep emission levels low, the instability of emission trends across Asia underscores the need for emission reduction strategies tailored to the specific context of each country.</description>

                The electrochemical reduction of riboflavin (vitamin B2) in a dimethyl sulfoxide solvent was examined under a CO2 atmosphere and compared with results under an argon atmosphere. Variable-scan-rate cyclic voltammetry combined with controlled potential electrolysis (CPE) and analysis by UV&#8211;vis and EPR spectroscopies provided insights into the nature of interactions of reduced flavins with dissolved CO2. Reductive exhaustive CPE experiments under CO2 indicated an overall two-electron stoichiometry, compared to one-electron reduction under an argon atmosphere, due to the lowering of the formal one-electron reduction potential of the flavin radical anion to form the dianion, which can be rationalized by riboflavin&#8211;CO2 molecular interactions. UV&#8211;vis spectroscopic measurements confirmed complete chemical reversibility of the redox transformations over extended time scales. Digital simulation modeling of the voltammetric data enabled extraction of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for the proposed mechanism, comprising multiple proton-coupled electron transfer steps, diamagnetic anions, radical anions, and neutral radical intermediates enroute to the fully reduced state, as well as evidence of a long-lived solution phase complex of the reduced riboflavin with CO2.</description>

      <title>Assessing the design of integrated methane sensing networks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad893d</link>
      <description>Lekha Patel, Jake P Zenker, Environmental Research Letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403596063

                Abstract While methane is the second largest contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide, it has a larger warming effect over a much shorter lifetime. Despite accelerated technological efforts to radically reduce global carbon dioxide emissions, rapid reductions in methane emissions are needed to limit near-term warming. Being primarily emitted as a byproduct from agricultural activities and energy extraction, methane is currently monitored via bottom-up (i.e., activity level) or top-down (via airborne or satellite retrievals) approaches. However, significant methane leaks remain undetected and emission rates are challenging to characterize with current monitoring frameworks. In this paper, we study the design of a layered monitoring approach that combines bottom-up and top-down approaches as an integrated sensing network. By recognizing that varying meteorological conditions and emission rates impact the efficacy of bottom-up monitoring, we develop a probabilistic approach to optimal sensor placement in its bottom-up network. Subsequently, we derive an inverse Bayesian framework to quantify the improvement that a design-optimized integrated framework has on emission-rate quantifications and their uncertainties. We find that under realistic meteorological conditions, the overall error in estimating the true emission rates is approximately 1.3 times higher, with their uncertainties being approximately 2.4 times higher, when using a randomized network over an optimized network, highlighting the importance of optimizing the design of integrated methane sensing networks. Further, we find that optimized networks can improve scenario coverage fractions by more than a factor of 2 over experimentally-studied networks, and identify a budget threshold beyond which the rate of optimized-network coverage improvement exhibits diminishing returns, suggesting that strategic sensor placement is also crucial for maximizing network efficiency.</description>

      <title>Efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction Reaction on Cu-Decorated Biphenylene</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c08499</link>

                Developing efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction into value-added products is crucial for a green economy. Inspired by the recent experimental synthesis of biphenylene (BPH) and the excellent catalytic activity of copper dispersed on two-dimensional (2D) materials, we chose to systematically investigate the pristine, defective, and Cu-decorated BPH for the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to value-added hydrocarbons. It is observed that the CO2 molecules bind weakly to the pristine BPH, indicating their chemical inertness. Carbon single-vacancy defects facilitate CO2 adsorption with a strong binding energy (Eb) of &#8722;3.23 eV, detrimental to the CO2 reduction reaction (CRR) mechanism. We have further investigated the binding energy and kinetic stability of Cu-decorated BPH as a single-atom-catalyst (SAC). The molecular dynamics simulations confirm the kinetic stability, revealing that the Cu-atom avoids agglomeration under low metal dispersal conditions. The CO2 molecule gets adsorbed horizontally on the Cu-BPH surface with a &#916;Eb of &#8722;0.52 eV. The CRR mechanism is investigated using two pathways beginning with two different initial states, formate (*OCOH) and carboxylic (*COOH). The formate pathway confirms the conversion of *OCOH to *HCOOH with the rate-limiting potential (UL) of 0.39 eV for the production of HCOOH, while for the carboxylic pathway, the conversion of *COH to *CHOH has a UL of 0.32 eV, eventually producing CH3OH. Our findings highlight the role of Cu-BPH as an efficient SAC for CO2 catalytic activity to C1 products, as compared to the state-of-the-art Cu, and holds promise as an electrocatalyst for CRR.</description>

                ABSTRACT The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (eCO 2 RR) is a promising technology for synthesizing value&#8208;added products required in the transition towards a more circular and renewable&#8208;based economy. In this context, the electrochemical production of formic acid has the potential to become economically competitive to energy&#8208;demanding conventional synthetic methods, thereby presenting a sustainable alternative. However, to enhance energy efficiency and selectivity toward the targeted product significant technological improvements in key components (e.g., electrodes, catalysts, electrolytes, membranes, cells, solvents) are required. Over recent years, our research has focused on understanding the influence of catalyst, gas diffusion electrode (GDE) architecture and performance, and cell design in the eCO 2 RR to formic acid. This perspective article provides an overview of the current status of these specific components, as well as our insights and those of other researchers, regarding potential future investigations and applications.</description>

                Abstract Both the physicochemical properties of catalytic material and the structure of loaded catalyst layer (CL) on gas diffusion electrode (GDE) are of crucial importance in determining the conversion efficiency and product selectivity of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). However, the highly reducing reaction condition of CO 2 RR will lead to the uncontrollable structural and compositional changes of catalysts, making it difficult to tailor surface properties and microstructure of the real active species for favored products. Herein, the interlayer microenvironment of copper&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) is rationally tuned by a facile ink solvent engineering, which affects both the surface characters and microstructure of CL on GDE, leading to distinct catalytic activity and product selectivity. According to series of in situ and ex situ techniques, the appropriate surface wettability and thickness of porous CL are found to play critical roles in controlling the local CO 2 concentration and water dissociation steps that are key for hydrogenation during CO 2 RR, leading to a high Faradaic efficiency of 75.3% for C 2+ products and a partial current density of 275 mA cm &#8722;2 at &#8722;0.8 V versus RHE. This work provides insights into rational design of efficient electrocatalysts toward CO 2 RR for multi&#8208;carbon generation.</description>

The two first articles establish links between the energy systems analysis model EnergyPLAN and respectively the Quintel Energy Transition Model (ETM) and urban building energy modelling to form more comprehensive modelling environments. Third, an article addresses energy systems modelling from a more spatial perspective, with the presentation of the ODHeatMap tool to model the spatial characteristics of heat demand particularly in areas where optimal energy planning data may not be available. Lastly, Vietnam&#8217;s economy and energy demand is increasing rapidly, and, in this issue, analyses are presented regarding how ambitions measures in renewable energy utilization and energy efficiency improvements have to beer under different scenarios, for Vietnam to reach its carbon dioxide emission reduction goal.</description>

                Catalytic conversion of CO2 to valuable products is a promising way to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emission. Herein, a strategy for coupling conversion of CO2 and high&#8208;carbon alkane to CO and gasoline is developed, which is a feasible choice for the combination of CO2 recycling and petroleum refining. The CO2 conversion reaches 2.6% under mild condition (270 &#176;C), and the selectivity of gasoline in the cracking products exceeds 70 wt%. Additionally, the introduction of CO2 improves the selectivity of aromatic hydrocarbons and increases the octane number of gasoline. Mechanism studies indicate that synergistic effect between Br&#248;nsted acid centers and Ni sites on the Beta zeolite supported Ni (20 wt%) catalyst (20Ni/&#946;) plays the key role in alkane cracking and CO2 reduction. Notably, 13CO2 isotopic experiments show that the hydrogen produced during the aromatization can be captured by CO2, inhibiting undesired hydrogen transfer pathways and enhancement the yield of aromatics, while CO2 is converted into valuable CO.</description>

                Developing flame-retardant epoxy resins (EPs) is essential to broaden their industrial applications, as their inherent flammability restricts their widespread use. In this study, commercial cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles were modified with oleic acid and successfully assembled onto the surface of pyrophosphate piperazine (PAPP) through a simple solvophobic effect, constructing an integrated superstructure flame retardant, CeO2@PAPP, with enhanced performance integration. Compared to traditional simple blends, the EP composite with 10 wt% CeO2@PAPP displayed superior flame retardancy, thanks to the more subtle synergistic effects between flame retardant components and their favorable interface interactions. The EP composite achieved a UL-94 V-0 rating and increased the limiting oxygen index (LOI) to 34.2%. Significant reductions of 56.3% in peak heat release rate (PHRR) and 38.2% in total heat release (THR) were observed. Furthermore, total smoke release (TSR), carbon monoxide yield (COPR), and carbon dioxide yield (CO2PR) decreased by 52.2%, 50.2%, and 67.3%, respectively. Through comprehensive and detailed characterization, it was discovered that the assembled integrated CeO2@PAPP flame retardant can perform better in both the gas phase and condensed phase, resulting in superior flame-retardant properties. This study offers an effective strategy for developing highly flame-retardant EPs, thereby expanding their potential applications across various industries.</description>

                Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies present a promising solution for converting CO2 emissions into valuable products. Here we show how amines, such as monoethanolamine (MEA) and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), influence the electrochemical CO2 reduction process in an integrated CCU system. Using in situ spectroscopic techniques, we identify the key roles of carbamate bond strength, proton shuttling, and amine structure in dictating reaction pathways on copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) electrodes. Our findings demonstrate that on Cu electrodes, surface blockage by ammonium species impedes CO&#8322; reduction, whereas on Pb electrodes, proton shuttling enhances the production of hydrocarbon products. This study provides additional insights into optimizing CCU systems by tailoring the choice of amines and electrode materials, advancing the selective conversion of CO&#8322; into valuable chemicals. Integrated carbon capture and utilization (CCU) systems offer a sustainable approach to converting CO&#8322; emissions into valuable chemicals. Here, the authors report the choice of amine and electrode materials significantly impact the efficiency and selectivity of CO2 reduction in CCU processes.</description>

      <description>R. Blum, J. Bugge, No host. 84659(None)] 2010. https://openalex.org/W4403684189

                Abstract This paper examines the ongoing significance of pulverized coal-fired steam plants in global power generation, focusing on technological advancements and strategies for improving efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions. It traces the development of Ultra-Supercritical (USC) plants with steam temperatures around 600&#176;C and explores immediate opportunities for further efficiency enhancements, including the innovative Master Cycle. The potential for increasing steam temperatures to 650&#176;C using new steels and to 700&#176;C with nickel-based AD 700 technology is discussed. The paper outlines a comprehensive strategy for CO2 emission reduction: maximizing plant efficiency, co-firing with CO2-neutral fuels, and integrating with district heating/cooling or industrial heat consumers. Carbon capture and storage techniques are presented as a final step in this multi-faceted approach to sustainable power generation.</description>

                Objective: To assess the impact of implementing telehealth in outpatient clinics on the carbon emissions associated with the delivery of health care. Design &amp; Setting: Retrospective cohort study in large metropolitan quaternary referral health service from January 2021- December 2022. Participants: All patients who attended an outpatient clinic appointment during the study period, either in-person, via telehealth or via telephone. Main outcome measures: The estimation of carbon emissions in tonnes (t) of CO2-equivalent (CO2-e) associated with in-person and telehealth appointments based on emissions associated with travel, telehealth platform usage and N95 mask usage. Results: There were 571,121 outpatient clinic appointments during the study period. Of the appointments, 251,458 (44%) were conducted remotely, resulting in an estimated reduction in 3,629t of CO2-e emissions in the two-year period. Telehealth consultations in this time contributed 4.5t of CO2-equivalent emissions. The total emission usage of telehealth clinic was only 0.12% of emissions generated from face-to-face clinic appointments. Conclusion: Telehealth offers the opportunity of substantial carbon emissions reduction within the healthcare sector, while also providing cost and time-saving benefits for healthcare services and patients. Limitations include generalisation of transportation modes and the retrospective nature of the data collection.</description>

      <title>Accounting Method and Indicators of Multilevel CO2 Emissions Based on Cost During Construction of Shield Tunnels</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app14209552</link>
      <description>Shuihua Zheng, Xiongyao Xie, Biao Zhou, Applied Sciences. 14(20)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403598525

                With the rapid expansion of shield tunnel projects in China, precise accounting of CO2 emissions throughout the entire process is essential for advancing green and low-carbon construction practices. This paper introduces an innovative CO2 accounting methodology utilizing a cost-based carbon emission coding system. It adopts a multilevel approach to carbon emission accounting, aligned with this coding system, which facilitates a detailed examination of carbon emission ratios and characteristics across various construction techniques. The analysis includes six typical shield tunnel projects varying in diameter, focusing on sub-projects to scrutinize CO2 emissions and establish specific indicators. The findings indicate that CO2 emissions per 10,000 yuan of investment, approximately 30.25% (or 3025 kgCO2e/10,000 yuan), are more consistent than those per unit of length. Moreover, the study highlights differing CO2 emission trends among sub-projects compared to whole tunnel projects, assessing emission indicators and distribution patterns in four sub-projects: shield excavation, segmental lining, internal structure, and tunnel reinforcement. From these findings, the paper suggests more precise and tailored strategies for CO2 reduction. This research provides a theoretical basis for future construction planning and carbon management strategies.</description>

      <title>The impact of calcined mud on the rheological properties of eco-friendly concretes using the equivalent mortar method (CEM)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54021/seesv5n2-371</link>
      <description>Mohammed Yacine Kiboub, Souad Malab, Akram Salah Eddine Bela&#239;di, Kaouthar Takhi, STUDIES IN ENGINEERING AND EXACT SCIENCES. 5(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403638424

                In order to harmonise technical and environmental aspects, people today focus not only on concrete's technical characteristics but also on environmental imperatives. Thus, the emphasis is on the development of concrete and cements that offer ecological and sustainable advantages. Commonly, people use various natural materials as cement additives, demonstrating their effectiveness by replacing a significant portion of the cement in the hardened state of concrete. This substitution leads to a substantial and remarkable reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. However, when it comes to the physical properties of the material in its fresh state, challenges may arise. Indeed, the rheological changes induced by these additives may hinder the on-site use of this eco-concrete. The main purpose of this study is to find out how adding minerals to environmentally friendly concrete changes its rheological parameters (yield stress, plastic viscosity) and fresh properties (slump, flow time). We will approach this using the concept of mortar equivalent to concrete (CEM). We developed five formulations of CEM&#8217;s by substituting cement with calcined mud (CM) in binary mixing systems at a temperature of 20 &#176;C. The results showed that adding binary cements with calcined mud had a negative effect on the fresh properties and rheological parameters. However, when substitution happens at a low rate, it behaves almost like control mortar (OPC).</description>

                Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate whether the use of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) angiography decreases the intraoperative use of iodine contrast medium (ICM), thereby decreasing the risk of developing postoperative renal damage in patients undergoing iliac branch device (IBD) implantation. Methods: Patients undergoing IBD implantation at a single tertiary center between May 2013 and August 2019 were screened for inclusion in the study. A cohort of patients in whom an intraoperative imaging protocol using predominantly CO 2 was compared with a control group in whom ICM was used (CO 2 and ICM groups). Fusion imaging was used in both groups. Retrospective review of the medical charts and all imaging was performed. Variables were expressed as median with interquartile range (IQR) or absolute number and percentage. Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney and &#967; 2 tests were used to compare continuous and categorical variables, respectively. P values of &lt;0 .05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Twenty-three patients were included in the CO 2 group and 21 in the ICM group without significant differences in patient characteristics between the groups. Intraoperative iodine exposure was lower in the CO 2 group than in the ICM group (8.2 g [IQR, 7.1-10.9 g) vs 15.8 g (IQR 7.6-21 g); P = 0.015, respectively). There were no differences in technical success, clinical success, fluoroscopy time, and dose-area product in the 2 groups. There were no adverse events that could be related to the intraoperative use of CO 2. There was no difference in postoperative survival nor renal function assessment between the groups despite the higher number of accessory renal arteries embolized in the CO 2 group ( P = 0.221). Conclusions: Reduction of intraoperative ICM exposure during IBD implantation is feasible through the predominant use of CO 2 automated angiography. This can be done safely without affecting the technical success or radiation exposure. The immediate postoperative renal damage was low when a modern intraoperative imaging protocol with ICM was used and was not significantly reduced by the use of CO 2 . Further and larger studies are needed to investigate the long-term effects. Clinical Impact This study aimed to investigate how to minimize intraoperative risk during iliac branched repair exploring the intraoperative use of automated carbon dioxide angiography in order to decrease the use of contrast media protecting renal function and thereby potentially impacting long-term survival</description>

                Introduction Global food security is challenged by the increasing levels of air pollutants like ozone (O 3 ) through their impacts on crop productivity. The present study was conducted to quantify the interactive effect of elevated ozone (O 3 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), on different rice varieties in northern India. Methods An experiment was conducted in Genetic H field, Environment science, IARI for two consecutive years (2020 and 2021) during the kharif season, to quantify the impact of elevated O 3 and CO 2 interaction on productivity, and plant N in three rice varieties (Pusa basmati 1121, Nagina 22, IR64 Drt1) under different nitrogen (N) management practices. Rice crop was grown in Free Air Ozone-Carbon dioxide Enrichment rings (FAOCE) rings with two levels of O 3 (elevated 60 &#177;10ppb and ambient) and two levels of CO 2 (elevated, 550&#177;25 ppm and ambient) concentration and their interaction with two N fertilizer treatments i.e., 100% RDN (recommended dose of N) and 125% RDN. Results and discussion Elevated O 3 significantly decreased physiological parameters like photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate of the crop. Grain yield reduced by 7.2-7.5%, in Pusa Basmati 1121 and from 6.9-9% in IR64 Drt1 varieties in elevated O 3 treatment as compared to ambient treatment. Yield reduction in Nagina 22 variety was not significant in elevated O 3 treatment. Elevated CO 2 concentration of 550 ppm was able to fully compensate the yield loss in Nagina 22 variety and partially compensate (3.9-8.0%) in Pusa Basmati 1121 and IR64 Drt1 varieties. Grain N concentration in rice varieties decreased by 10.8-14.7% during first year and by 7.8-20.6% during second year in elevated O 3 plus CO 2 interaction treatment than ambient. Grain N uptake also decreased (13.2-17.1% in first year and 4.5-22.8% in second year) in elevated O 3 plus CO 2 interaction treatment as compared to ambient. Application of additional 25% of recommended dose of N improved grain N concentration, grain N uptake as well as available N of soil as compared to 100% RDN treatment in elevated O 3 plus CO 2 interaction treatment. Additional 25% N dose could help in sustaining rice productivity and quality under elevated O 3 and CO 2 condition.</description>

                Abstract Egypt formulated its sustainable development strategy "Egypt Vision 2030" in 2015. This strategy aims to protect the environment in the development process by integrating environmental aspects into economic and social development plans to manage natural resources, conserve natural capital, and develop to protect the environmental rights of future generations. According to the IEA (International Energy Agency) CO2 emission reduction projects to track advances in carbon capture, utilization, storage as well as use of naturally occurring CO2 for EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) of depleted reservoirs. This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating underground CO2 storage capacity according to the facies of different formations applicable to the CO2 EOR projects. The methods proposed in this document will not only help third parties create reports and inventories of greenhouse gas emissions from companies, but also help governments to encourage companies to reduce their CO2 emissions. It would be beneficial for the industry implementing CCUS (Carbo Capture Utilize and Storage) projects to provide key evaluation parameters and implement the necessary monitoring techniques. Due to advantages and vast resource capacity, onshore CO2 storage provides an attractive option. Bahariya concession is located at the eastern trough of Abu Gharadig basin, Western Desert, Egypt. By Using the available data, a subsurface geologic evaluation and 3D modelling was carried out in terms of thickness variation, lithofacies, structural setting and depositional environment of the studied rock unit in the encountered basin. This study presents both depleted reservoir and shallow non-reservoir formations as preliminary targets for CO2 storage potential. It was concluded that both clastic and non-clastic Cretaceous formations have a high-quality potential geological reservoir repository for CO2 storage capacity.</description>

      <title>Enhancing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electroreduction Precision to Ethylene and Ethanol: The Role of Additional Boron Catalytic Sites in Cu&#8208;Based Tandem Catalysts</title>

      <description>Fuqing Yu, Minxing Shu, Guangyao Zhang, Qiming Yu, Hongming Wang, Advanced Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403611551

                Abstract The electrocatalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into valuable multicarbon (C 2+ ) compounds offers a promising approach to mitigate CO 2 emissions and harness renewable energy. However, achieving precise selectivity for specific C 2+ products, such as ethylene and ethanol, remains a formidable challenge. This study shows that incorporating elemental boron (B) into copper (Cu) catalysts provides additional adsorption sites for * CO intermediates, enhancing the selectivity of desirable C 2+ products. Additionally, using a nickel single&#8208;atom catalyst (Ni&#8208;SAC) as a * CO source increases local * CO concentration and reduces the hydrogen evolution reaction. In situ experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that surface&#8208;bound boron units adsorb and convert * CO more efficiently, promoting ethylene production, while boron within the bulk phase of copper influences charge transfer, facilitating ethanol generation. In a neutral electrolyte, the bias current density for ethylene production using the B&#8208;O&#8208;Cu2@Ni&#8208;SAC0.05 hybrid catalyst exceeded 300 mA cm &#8722;2 , and that for ethanol production with B&#8208;O&#8208;Cu5@Ni&#8208;SAC0.2 surpassed 250 mA cm &#8722;2 . This study underscores that elemental doping in Cu&#8208;based catalysts not only alters charge and crystalline phase arrangements at Cu sites but also provides additional reduction sites for coupling reactions, enabling the efficient synthesis of distinct C 2+ products.</description>

      <title>Lower grass stomatal conductance under elevated CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can decrease transpiration and evapotranspiration rates despite carbon fertilization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/pld3.70013</link>
      <description>Sate Ahmad, Charilaos Yiotis, Weimu Xu, Jan Knappe, Laurence Gill, Jennifer C. McElwain, Plant Direct. 8(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403617022

                Abstract Anthropogenic increase in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) affects plant physiology. Plant responses to elevated CO 2 typically include: (1) enhanced photosynthesis and increased primary productivity due to carbon fertilization and (2) suppression of leaf transpiration due to CO 2 &#8208;driven decrease in stomatal conductance. The combined effect of these responses on the total plant transpiration and on evapotranspiration (ET) has a wide range of implications on local, regional, and global hydrological cycles, and thus needs to be better understood. Here, we investigated the net effect of CO 2 &#8208;driven perennial ryegrass ( Lolium perenne ) physiological responses on transpiration and evapotranspiration by integrating physiological and hydrological (water budget) methods, under a controlled environment. Measurements of the net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, leaf mass per area, aboveground biomass, and water balance components were recorded. Measured variables under elevated CO 2 were compared with those of ambient CO 2 . As expected, our results show that elevated CO 2 significantly decreases whole&#8208;plant transpiration rates (38% lower in the final week) which is a result of lower stomatal conductance (57% lower in the final week) despite a slight increase in aboveground biomass. Additionally, there was an overall decline in evapotranspiration (ET) under elevated CO 2 , indicating the impact of CO 2 &#8208;mediated suppression of transpiration on the overall water balance. Although studies with larger sample sizes are needed for more robust conclusions, our findings have significant implications for global environmental change. Reductions in ET from ryegrass&#8208;dominated grasslands and pastures could increase soil moisture and groundwater recharge, potentially leading to increased surface runoff and flooding.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Calendar Events upon Urban Vehicle Behaviour and Emissions Using Telematics Data</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/smartcities7060120</link>
      <description>Junjun Xiang, Omid Ghaffarpasand, Francis D. Pope, Smart Cities. 7(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403733733

                Employing vehicle telematics data, this study investigates the transport environment across urban and major road networks during a two-week period encompassing the Easter holidays, considered as a case study. The analysis spans four distinct years: 2016, 2018, 2021, and 2022. Geospatial and Temporal Mapping captured the dependencies of vehicle speed, acceleration, vehicle-specific power (VSP), and emission factors (EFs) for air pollutants (CO2 and NOx) on the studied calendar period. The results showed that during the Easter holiday, the median vehicle speeds exceeded annual averages by roughly 5%, indicating a clear deviation from regular traffic patterns. This deviation was particularly stark during the 2021 lockdown, with a significant drop in vehicle presence, leading to less congestion and thus higher speeds and vehicle acceleration. The emissions analyses revealed that individual cars emit higher levels of CO2 and NOx during Easter. Specifically, the median values of CO2 EF and NOx EF were 9% and 11% higher than the annual norm. When combined with road occupancy data, the results demonstrate that the Easter holidays in 2022 had a variable impact on NOx and CO2 emissions, with significant reductions on major roads during weekday rush hours (15&#8211;25%) but slight increases on urban roads during weekend periods.</description>

      <title>Climate Change Effects in Stock Markets</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54097/430kvj67</link>
      <description>Yang Ju, Highlights in Business Economics and Management. 41(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403572021

                Climate change significantly impacts global stock markets through both short-term extreme weather events and long-term climate shifts. This study examines the relationship between CO2 emissions and stock returns across 19 countries from 2001 to 2020 using regression analysis. The findings also reveal a positive correlation between CO2 emissions and stock returns, indicating that investors anticipate higher returns to offset climate-related risks. This suggests that higher CO2 emissions drive investor expectations for increased returns to compensate for potential economic losses. The study highlights the importance of balanced emission reduction strategies and promoting green finance to support sustainable economic growth. Additionally, it underscores the need to integrate climate risks into financial decision-making, offering valuable insights into the financial implications of climate change and guiding policymakers and investors in addressing these challenges. By providing empirical evidence on the link between CO2 emissions and stock returns, this research enriches existing knowledge and emphasizes the financial risks and opportunities presented by climate change. The study's results align with the carbon risk premium theory, which posits that investors demand higher returns from companies with higher carbon emissions.

                In the context of achieving the two-carbon target, this study utilized a wastewater treatment plant in Shenyang City as a case study to accurately calculate indirect emissions related to energy and chemical consumption within the energy-intensive wastewater treatment industry. Sumo software was employed for precise mathematical modeling. Considering the operational characteristics of wastewater treatment plants in cold regions, this study innovatively divided the annual operation cycle into two periods, namely normal temperature and low temperature, and determined the optimal operational parameters under a low-carbon mode. The results indicate that precise regulation of dissolved oxygen concentration to 0.5&#8211;1.5 mg/L (normal temperature period) and 1&#8211;2 mg/L (low temperature period) can significantly reduce carbon emissions related to electricity consumption by 13,781.9 t CO2-eq. From the perspective of chemical consumption, adjusting the dosage of polyaluminum chloride (PAC) to 75% and sodium acetate to 70% during the normal temperature period can lead to a reduction in indirect carbon emissions of 1614.4 t CO2-eq compared to the same period last year. During the low-temperature period, by reducing the dosage of polyaluminum chloride to 80% and sodium acetate to 75%, the indirect carbon emissions can be reduced by 1557.3 t CO2-eq compared to the corresponding period last year. After optimization, USD 1.49 million can be saved. This study simulated the operation conditions of cold-region urban wastewater treatment plants at different times to effectively control carbon emissions resulting from energy and chemical consumption in wastewater treatment. This result can provide innovative ideas for energy saving and carbon reduction in cold-region wastewater treatment plants.</description>

      <title>Comparative Assessments of Low- and Medium-Pressure CO2 Transport At-Sea and Inland</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202410.1671.v1</link>

                Developing cost-efficient systems for transporting CO2 is key to accelerate the deployment of carbon capture and storage. The present work explores the impact of reducing the pressure of tank-based inland and at-sea transport on their techno-economic performance. The study uses established techno-economic models for CO2 transport, adjusted with the most up-to-date knowledge on costs of low-pressure containment and transport. Particularly, the impact of cargo tank material and design on the transport costs shows that low-pressure cargo tank systems can be 50% less expensive than medium-pressure systems if materials with similar price and strength can be used. This results in reductions in transport costs as high as 30% for long distances. This is partly driven by the currently suggested size limitation on medium-pressure shipping which limits its economies of scale. If this limitation is alleviated, the cost advantage of low-pressure shipping compared to medium-pressure is more limited (10-20%) although it remains advantageous. The same scaling effects on capacity were not found for truck and barge inland transport, thus yielding 1-10% cost reductions of low- relative to medium-pressure transport. These results imply that future systems may combine medium-pressure inland and low-pressure at-sea transport, and that efficient solutions connecting the two must be investigated.</description>

      <title>On the Significance of Hydrate Formation/Dissociation during CO2 Injection in Depleted Gas Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/218550-pa</link>
      <description>V. Indina, Bruno Ramon Batista Fernandes, Mojdeh Delshad, R. Farajzadeh, Kamy Sepehrnoori, SPE Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403682888

                Summary The study aims to quantitatively assess the risk of hydrate formation within the porous formation and its consequences on injectivity during storage of CO2 in depleted gas reservoirs considering low temperatures caused by the Joule-Thomson (JT) effect and hydrate kinetics. Hydrates formed during CO2 storage operation can occupy porous spaces in the reservoir rock, reducing the rock&#8217;s permeability and thus becoming a hindrance to the storage project. The aim was to understand which mechanisms can mitigate or prevent the formation of hydrates. The key mechanisms we studied included water dry-out, heat exchange with surrounding rock formation, and capillary pressure. A semicompositional thermal reservoir simulator is used to model the fluid and heat flow of CO2 through a reservoir initially composed of brine and methane. The simulator can model the formation and dissociation of both methane and CO2 hydrates using kinetic reactions. This approach has the advantage of computing the amount of hydrate deposited and estimating its effects on the porosity and permeability alteration. Sensitivity analyses are also carried out to investigate the impact of different parameters and mechanisms on the deposition of hydrates and the injectivity of CO2. Simulation results for a simplified model were verified with results from the literature. The key results of this work are as follows: (1) The JT effect strongly depends on the reservoir permeability and initial pressure and could lead to the formation of hydrates within the porous media even when the injected CO2 temperature was higher than the hydrate equilibrium temperature; (2) the heat gain from underburden and overburden rock formations could prevent hydrates formed at late time; (3) permeability reduction increased the formation of hydrates due to an increased JT cooling; and (4) water dry-out near the wellbore did not prevent hydrate formation. Finally, the role of capillary pressure was quite complex, as it reduced the formation of hydrates in certain cases and increased in other cases. Simulating this process with heat flow and hydrate reactions was also shown to present severe numerical issues. It was critical to select convergence criteria and linear system tolerances to avoid large material balance and numerical errors.</description>

      <title>Identification and Evaluation of Synergy Between Carbon Emissions and Air Pollutants in Inter-Industrial Trade Among Provinces in China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16209067</link>
      <description>Liying Niu, Jiaoyue Wang, Hongyan Zhao, Mingjing Ma, Fengming Xi, Sustainability. 16(20)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403599343

                With the vigorous promotion in China of efforts to reduce pollution and carbon emissions, examining their synergies becomes increasingly crucial. This study used the multi-regional input&#8211;output (MRIO) table to build the consumption-based industrial emissions inventories of CO2 and three major air pollutants (PM2.5, NOx, and SO2) and constructed synergistic emission indices of the intensity and magnitude to identify and evaluate the synergy between carbon emissions and air pollutants in inter-industrial trade among 30 provinces in mainland China. The results show that more than 85% and 40% of inter-provincial and inter-industrial trades have synergistic emissions between CO2 and air pollutants, respectively. We identified 77 inter-provincial trades and 84 inter-industrial trades among provinces with strong synergistic emissions. They are mainly reflected in the demand of the construction industry in Zhejiang and Guangdong for the nonmetal mineral products manufacturing industry in Henan, and the metal smelting and processing industry in Hebei, along with the demand of the service industry in Beijing for the electric power, steam, and hot water production and supply industry in Inner Mongolia. Our study provides new insights into the synergistic reduction of CO2 and air pollutants within the supply chain, thereby enriching the discourse on regional and industrial synergies in achieving sustainable development goals.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of Environmental Impact of Each Building Material using Life Cycle assessment(LCA)_Focusing on Types of Construction Wood and Concrete</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.4491/ksee.2024.46.10.570</link>
      <description>Soon Gil Kwon, Yoon-Seong Chang, H. Choi, Journal of Korean Society of Environmental Engineers. 46(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403667543

                Objectives:The construction sector is a very important sector in achieving carbon neutrality. In modern society, construction has grown rapidly, and basic materials such as cement and concrete have contributed greatly to the development of construction. These materials emit a large amount of global warming substances during the raw material extraction and production process, causing serious environmental pollution. In order to establish a carbon reduction strategy to slow down global warming, we compared the environmental impacts of each building material and showed the current situation.Methods:The LCI DB for the construction materials used in the two-story wooden house (Building area 128.67m2, total floor area 235.73m2) located in the National Institute of Forest Science was extracted. Then, the data for LCA was processed and performed through the life cycle assessment methodology for the resources consumed from raw material collection, material production, and transportation stages. Then, based on the environmental performance labeling impact assessment method, a study was conducted on the environmental impact categories of the actual construction materials used and comparisons with other construction materials.Results and Discussion:When analyzing the environmental impact of concrete [25-21-120] and construction wood used in wooden house, the environmental impact was found to be 98.79% higher on average in the pre-manufacturing stage than in the manufacturing stage, and construction wood was confirmed to have a reduction effect of 62.21 kg CO2-eq per 1 m3 compared to concrete. Through the scenario, there was a carbon reduction effect of up to 36% when the entire area was replaced with wood. In addition, the environmental impact by major construction material was quantitatively quantified.Conclusion:When building a wooden house, reducing the amount of concrete equivalent to the amount of wood is expected to have a greenhouse gas reduction effect, so it is time to activate construction wood from the production process to the post-production stage to replace concrete. In addition, follow-up research on the development of construction technology with low environmental impact during construction should be continued. This study is expected to be used as a useful indicator for R&amp;D and policies in the construction field in the future, as it quantitatively quantified the amount of CO2 reduction per m3 when replacing concrete with construction wood and numerically compared and analyzed six major environmental impact categories by major construction materials.</description>

      <title>Advancing effective methods for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from rice (&lt;i&gt;Oryza sativa&lt;/i&gt; L.) fields</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/sae2.70012</link>
      <description>Shubh Pravat Singh Yadav, Netra Prasad Ghimire, Prava Paudel, Dipesh Kumar Mehata, Sangita Bhujel, Journal of Sustainable Agriculture and Environment. 3(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403694588

                Abstract The implications of global warming present significant threats to both crop productivity and environmental sustainability. The global population greatly depends on rice as a staple food, contributing significantly to global warming and agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Agricultural soils play a crucial role in the release and uptake of essential GHGs, including methane (CH 4 ), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), serving as both sources and sinks within the agricultural ecosystem. Notably, rice fields alone account for approximately 30% and 11% of global CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from agricultural activities, respectively. As the demand for rice is expected to rise in the future, it becomes increasingly critical to address GHG emissions and minimise the detrimental environmental effects associated with rice production. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the available data regarding the influence of different crop management practices on GHG emissions in rice fields. We recognise the substantial potential for reducing GHG emissions through modifications in traditional crop management systems. Our analysis evaluates various options, such as adjustments in cropping practices, regulation of organic and fertiliser inputs, management of tillage techniques and irrigation strategies, and the selection of suitable cultivars, all of which can contribute to GHG emission reduction. It is crucial to consider that changes in management practices may have simultaneous and sometimes contradictory effects on different gases through various mechanisms. Therefore, our comprehensive evaluation aims to assess the potential global warming impact of each approach, considering the magnitude of their effects on all gases. This assessment seeks to identify suitable crop management practices that effectively reduce GHG emissions in rice cultivation while considering the overall environmental impact.</description>

                This study explores the role of digitalization in implementing carbon-free economy principles in Ukraine, with a particular focus on how digital technologies contribute to enhancing energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions. Digitalization serves as a critical enabler of sustainable development by providing tools for optimizing energy consumption, improving resource management, and minimizing the environmental footprint of economic activities. Through correlation and regression analyses, the research investigates the relationship between investments in digital technologies, environmental protection measures, and CO2 emissions for the period from 2007 to 2020. The results reveal that while digitalization has the potential to improve energy efficiency, its current impact on reducing CO2 emissions remains limited. The findings indicate that increased investments in renewable energy sources and more comprehensive integration of digital technologies into the energy sector are essential to achieve significant reductions in emissions. Additionally, the study highlights the positive effect of innovation-driven activities on energy efficiency but points to the need for further development and deployment of environmentally friendly digital solutions. The research also underscores the importance of continued financial support for green technologies and emphasizes the necessity of improving greenhouse gas monitoring systems. Practical recommendations include increasing investment in renewable energy, expanding the use of smart technologies across industries, and promoting long-term innovation strategies aimed at achieving carbon neutrality. Overall, the research concludes that digital innovation plays a supporting role in achieving energy efficiency but requires stronger policy frameworks, investment, and coordination to realize its full potential in contributing to environmental sustainability.</description>

      <title>The effect of firewood combustion cookstove types on indoor air pollution and deforestation in selected rural houses of Ethiopia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2024.1326517</link>
      <description>Miftah Fekadu, Moges Molla, Birhanu Hailu, Frontiers in Environmental Science. 12(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403738433

                Introduction Indoor air pollution occurs in a microenvironment such as residential homes, closed working places, or industries in which people spend a large part of their time. Cooking or baking food in traditional or open three-stone cookstoves by using firewood is the cause for kitchen-related smoke indoor air pollution and deforestation. Modifying traditional firewood cookstoves could reduce the emissions of indoor air pollutants. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of firewood cookstove types on indoor air pollution, emission reduction, and deforestation in selected rural houses of Bure, Ameya, and Dalocha woredas (districts) of Ethiopia. Methods Indoor air pollutants such as carbonmonoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), sulfurdioxide (SO 2 ), and particulate matters (PMs) were measured in three replicates for 3 min. within an average cooking time of 1 h using an automatic gas sensor. The amount of wood was separately measured by using graduated weight balance (0.1 gm). Results and discussion The cooking place was mostly the same room as the sleeping place without a separate kitchen. The improved cookstoves were installed without a chimney (smokeoutlet) and with wider spaces left for a firewood inlet. In improved Injera baking cookstoves, the mean emission of CO was 1004.80 mg/m 3 , 33.00 mg/m 3 , and 53.85 mg/m 3 in Bure, Ameya, and Dalocha woredas, respectively, which were lower than the emissions from open cookstoves. The mean concentration of PM2.5 in open cookstoves in Bure, Ameya, and Dalocha woredaswas 124.50 mg/m 3 , 0.53 mg/m 3 , and 0.04 mg/m 3 , respectively, which are higher than the emission from improved stoves. In Bure woreda households, the CO exposure was above 26 times the permissible limit of WHO standards. Biomass consumption was positively correlated with the moisture content of wood ( p &amp;lt; 0.05). Improved cookstoves reduced indoor air pollution by 13%&#8211;81% and carbon emission and deforestation by 20%&#8211;41% when compared with the open three-stone cookstoves. Indoor air pollutants are risks to health and cause climate change problems. Therefore, awareness should be created on the health effects of firewood smoke indoor air pollution, ventilation of cooking places, and installation of chimneys with improved cookstoves.</description>

      <title>Low latency carbon budget analysis reveals a large decline of the land carbon sink in 2023</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwae367</link>
      <description>Piyu Ke, Philippe Ciais, Stephen Sitch, Wei Li, Ana Bastos, Zhu Liu, Yidi Xu, Xiaofan Gui, Jiang Bian, Daniel Goll, Yi Xi, Wanjing Li, Michael O&#8217;Sullivan, Jeffeson Goncalves de Souza, Pierre Friedlingstein, Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Chevallier, National Science Review. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403702208

                Abstract In 2023, the CO2 growth rate was 3.37 &#177; 0.11 ppm at Mauna Loa, 86% above the previous year, and hitting a record high since observations began in 1958, while global fossil fuel CO2 emissions only increased by 0.6 &#177; 0.5%. This implies an unprecedented weakening of land and ocean sinks, and raises the question of where and why this reduction happened. Here we show a global net land CO2 sink of 0.44 &#177; 0.21 GtC yr&#8722;1, the weakest since 2003. We used dynamic global vegetation models, satellites fire emissions, an atmospheric inversion based on OCO-2 measurements, and emulators of ocean biogeochemical and data driven models to deliver a fast-track carbon budget in 2023. Those models ensured consistency with previous carbon budgets. Regional flux anomalies from 2015&#8211;2022 are consistent between top-down and bottom-up approaches, with the largest abnormal carbon loss in the Amazon during the drought in the second half of 2023 (0.31 &#177; 0.19 GtC yr&#8722;1), extreme fire emissions of 0.58 &#177; 0.10 GtC yr&#8722;1 in Canada and a loss in South-East Asia (0.13 &#177; 0.12 GtC yr&#8722;1). Since 2015, land CO2 uptake north of 20&#176;N declined by half to 1.13 &#177; 0.24 GtC yr&#8722;1 in 2023. Meanwhile, the tropics recovered from the 2015&#8211;16 El Ni&#241;o carbon loss, gained carbon during the La Ni&#241;a years (2020&#8211;2023), then switched to a carbon loss during the 2023 El Ni&#241;o (0.56 &#177; 0.23 GtC yr&#8722;1). The ocean sink was stronger than normal in the equatorial eastern Pacific due to reduced upwelling from La Ni&#241;a's retreat in early 2023 and the development of El Ni&#241;o later. Land regions exposed to extreme heat in 2023 contributed a gross carbon loss of 1.73 GtC yr&#8722;1, indicating that record warming in 2023 had a strong negative impact on the capacity of terrestrial ecosystems to mitigate climate change.</description>

      <title>Modelling the integration of bagasse pyrolysis into sugar mill energy systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.36961/si32448</link>

                Pyrolysis degrades biomass under low oxygen conditions to produce an energy-rich gas, bio-oil, and carbon-dense biochar. The resulting bio-oil and gas can be combusted for high energy production, while biochar is a high-value product with potential as a fertiliser and soil amendment product. However, very few studies have been on integrating pyrolysis into the sugar mill energy system. This study aimed to model the integration of bagasse pyrolysis into an energy system based on Victoria Mill. The model was well-validated from previous literature on bagasse pyrolysis and mill system data. The pyrolysis unit&#8217;s operating conditions were optimised for steam production, carbon emission reduction, and product value, resulting in 20% less steam production, 16% reduced CO2 emissions, and 76% higher economic profit than current operations. Full steam production could be maintained by bypassing 30% of the bagasse to the pyrolysis unit and 70% directly to the boiler. This configuration led to 12% reduced CO2 emissions and 32% greater economic profits when compared to the current process. Overall, this research showed that the integration of bagasse pyrolysis into sugar mill energy systems has potentially substantial benefits, and its adoption in sugar milling deserves careful analysis.</description>

      <title>Spatially Explicit Life Cycle Global Warming and Eutrophication Potentials of Confined Dairy Production in the Contiguous US</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/environments11110230</link>
      <description>Xiaobo Xue Romeiko, Wangjian Zhang, Xue-Song Zhang, Jun&#8208;Ki Choi, Environments. 11(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403637701

                Assessing the spatially explicit life cycle environmental impacts of livestock production systems is critical for understanding the spatial heterogeneity of environmental releases and devising spatially targeted remediation strategies. This study presents the first spatially explicit assessment on life cycle global warming and eutrophication potentials of confined dairy production at a county scale in the contiguous US. The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model was used to estimate greenhouse gases (GHGs), NH3, and aqueous nutrient releases of feed production. The Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation model and Commodity Flow Survey were used to assess GHGs and NH3 from feed transportation. Emission-factor-based approaches were primarily used to calculate GHGs from enteric fermentation, and GHGs, NH3, and aqueous nutrient releases from manure management. Characterization factors reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Tool for Reduction and Assessment of Chemicals and other Environmental Impacts model were used to compute global warming and eutrophication potentials, respectively. The analyses revealed that life cycle global warming and eutrophication potentials of confined dairy production presented significant spatial heterogeneity among the US counties. For example, the life cycle global warming potential ranged from 462 kg CO2-eq/head to 14,189 kg CO2-eq/head. Surprisingly, sourcing feed locally cannot effectively reduce life cycle global warming and eutrophication potentials of confined dairy production. The feed supply scenarios with the lowest life cycle environmental impacts depend on the life cycle environmental impacts of feed production, geographic locations of confined dairy production, and specific impact categories. In addition, installing buffer strips in feed-producing hotspots can effectively reduce life cycle nutrient releases of confined dairy production. If 200 counties with the highest life cycle EP of corn adopt buffer strips, the reduction in life cycle EP of confined dairy production could reach 24.4%.</description>

                This research investigates the application of machine learning models to optimise renewable energy systems and contribute to achieving Net Zero emissions targets. The primary objective is to evaluate how machine learning can improve energy forecasting, grid management, and storage optimisation, thereby enhancing the reliability and efficiency of renewable energy sources. The methodology involved the application of various machine learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and ARIMA, to predict energy generation and demand patterns. These models were evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Key findings include a 15% improvement in grid efficiency after optimisation and a 10&#8211;20% increase in battery storage efficiency. Random Forest achieved the lowest MAE, reducing prediction error by approximately 8.5%. The study quantified CO2 emission reductions by energy source, with wind power accounting for a 15,000-ton annual reduction, followed by hydropower and solar reducing emissions by 10,000 and 7500 tons, respectively. The research concludes that machine learning can significantly enhance renewable energy system performance, with measurable reductions in errors and emissions. These improvements could help close the &#8220;ambition gap&#8221; by 20%, supporting global efforts to meet the 1.5 &#176;C Paris Agreement targets.</description>

      <description>Jiaji Zhang, Yu-Ting Lin, Li Wang, Qiankun Wang, Ke Zhu, Shize Yang, Guoqing Guo, Buildings. 14(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403761728

                This study focuses on developing and implementing zero-carbon buildings through the integration of multiple systems to meet China&#8217;s carbon neutrality goals. It emphasizes the significant role of the building sector in carbon emissions and highlights the challenge of increasing energy consumption conflicting with China&#8217;s &#8220;dual carbon&#8221; targets. To address this, the research proposes a comprehensive framework that combines multifunctional envelope structure (MES) systems, photovoltaic power generation, energy storage, direct current (DC) systems, flexible energy management (PEDF), and regional energy stations. This framework integrates different technologies such as phase change materials, radiation cooling, and carbon mineralized cement, aiming to reduce carbon emissions throughout the building&#8217;s lifecycle. The method has been successfully applied in the Yazhou Bay Zero Carbon Post Station project in Sanya, Hainan, with precise calculations of carbon emission reductions. The carbon emission calculations revealed a reduction of 44.13 tons of CO2 annually, totaling 1103.31 tons over 25 years, primarily due to the rooftop photovoltaic systems. It demonstrates that the multi-system integration can reduce carbon emissions and contribute to China&#8217;s broader carbon neutrality goals. This approach, if widely adopted, could accelerate the transition to carbon-neutral buildings in China.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Impact of Phase-Change Materials on Enhancing the Thermal Efficiency of Buildings in Tropical Climates</title>

                Civil construction and buildings account for a significant 36% of worldwide energy consumption, contributing to 37% of global CO2 emissions. In Brazil, buildings consume a substantial 51.2% of the nation&#8217;s electricity production. Remarkably, approximately one-third of this energy is allocated specifically for maintaining thermal comfort within these structures. The thermal performance of a building has a significant impact on its energy efficiency; in this way, technologies developed to contribute to the energy efficiency of envelopes can directly contribute to the reduction in the building&#8217;s overall energy consumption. PCMs are technologies capable of absorbing heat without increasing temperature and can contribute to the better energy performance of envelopes. PCMs are used as a thermal performance solution in cold climate regions, and studies show that they are likely to work in buildings in tropical climates. The objective of this work is to analyze the performance of PCMs in tropical regions of the southern hemisphere, specifically in Brazil, and their behavior according to the constructive system used. Computer simulation contributes to an analysis closer to the reality of the implementation of this technology in these regions. This work is carried out with simulations in the software EnergyPlusTM version 24.1. The results demonstrate that PCMs can effectively contribute to a reduction in energy consumption for the thermal comfort of buildings in tropical climates, demonstrating the possible feasibility of the development of this technology for tropical climates.</description>

                In this chapter, we will first review the elementary reactions involved in organic ligand transformations at transition metal complexes, which include oxidative addition, reductive elimination, insertion, elimination, nucleophilic and electrophilic reactions on the organic ligand, alkene and alkyne metathesis, and &#963;-bond metathesis. These are the reactions that characterise the chemistry of organometallic complexes, and this is the reason why organometallic complexes are used as catalysts for a variety of synthetic organic reactions. We will next discuss some typical examples of catalytic organic transformations and their catalytic mechanisms performed by transition metal complexes, such as hydrogenation, hydrosilylation, cross-coupling, and industrial reactions including hydroformylation, the Monsanto/Cativa process, and alkene polymerization. Furthermore, catalytic reactions related to energy conversion have been attracting increasing attention in recent years. To shed light on this topic, electrochemical catalytic generation of oxygen and hydrogen, photoreduction of CO2, and catalytic nitrogen fixation will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic Comparative Assessment of High Temperature Heat Pump Architectures for Industrial Pumped Thermal Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4066989</link>

                Abstract The industrial sector is a key global source of wealth, but it is also recognized as a major challenge toward worldwide decarbonization. Today the industrial sector requires more than 22 % of the global energy demand as thermal energy and produces for this about 40 % of the total CO2 emissions. Solutions to efficiently decarbonize the industrial sector are deemed. This work presents a comparative techno-economic performance assessment of a high temperature heat pump integration within a molten salts based power to heat system for industrial heat flexible generation. The main system performance is reported in terms of required working conditions and temperature for the heat pump and thermal demand size as well as reduction of the attainable levelized cost of heat (LCoH) against non-flexible electric boiler based systems. The impact of different industrial load profiles, electricity prices, heat pump capital cost and heat pump real to Carnot efficiency ratio are also presented. The results highlight that the proposed system can be cost-competitive, particularly for thermal demand around 10 MW and waste heat temperatures above 80&#176;C. Under these conditions LCoH reductions higher than 15 %, with respect to the considered non-flexible electric boiler alternative, are attainable. These LCoH reductions are primarily driven by savings in electrical consumption as high as 30 %. This study sets the ground for further power-to-heat techno-economic investigations addressing different industrial sectors and identifies main system and components design strategies, integrations, and targets.</description>

      <title>Investigation of NOx Generation and Ammonia Fuel Utilization in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/power2024-138521</link>

                Abstract Decreasing the generation of CO2 from energy production is a key area in energy research and environmental sustainability. Fuel cells represent a solution to reducing CO2 generation through the use of hydrogen fuel to generate electricity. However, the widespread use of hydrogen fueled fuel cells is generally limited by difficulty of hydrogen storage, transportation, and synthesis. The primary issue with hydrogen storage is that gaseous hydrogen contains low volumetric energy density. One promising option to address these difficulties is the use of ammonia (NH3) in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), which allows for storage of a liquid fuel source, rather than the highly compressed gaseous fuel. Previous work has shown that a SOFC using ammonia fuel is highly capable of generating electricity at levels comparable to that of pure hydrogen fuel. The nickel within the SOFC, along with the high operating temperatures, assists in the thermal cracking of ammonia. However, one missing piece from our previous work is an investigation of ammonia utilization. As such, this work will seek to evaluate the utilization though an exhaust gas analysis using mass spectroscopy and gas chromatography. Additionally, the exhaust gas composition is monitored for the presence of NOx group gases. With the use of ammonia as the fuel source, there is a possibility that we see nitrogen bonding to oxygen ions at the triple-phase boundary (TPB), leading to NOx formation. Given the danger presented by these gases, we must be certain that the concentrations are negligible, or that there will be sufficient NOx reduction strategies in the exhaust stream. SOFC performance results will be briefly discussed, along with an analysis of exhaust composition using gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy to demonstrate utilization of ammonia and evaluate NOx generation relative to fuel cell electrical performance at various operating temperature.</description>

                This study aims to analyze the evolving dynamics of environmental sustainability via a thorough investigation of deforestation, atmospheric carbon levels, ecological equilibrium, and global climate trends. A conclusion reached is that a positive association exists between deforestation and increasing global temperatures, shown by a twenty percent rise in CO2 emissions. The loss of forests has markedly contributed to ecological imbalance, leading to detrimental impacts on biodiversity, with a total increase of fifteen percent in habitat damage. Initiatives aimed at reducing deforestation have resulted in a major 10% decrease in global carbon absorption rates, emphasizing forest regeneration and markedly diminishing carbon sequestration capabilities. The major focus is on the degradation of ecosystems, illustrating a collective struggle, shown by a 12% reduction in forest coverage and a 15% increase in global warming indices. These discoveries enhance the knowledge of environmental changes that may impact future climate systems. Furthermore, they provide crucial direction for environmental policy-makers and establish a basis for further research initiatives.</description>

      <title>Is methane the 'climate culprit'? Fixing the 'Broken Record' while
  unmasking the dangers of using imprecise, long-term GWP for methane to
  address the climate emergency</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2409.06212</link>

                Methane (CH4) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) with a short atmospheric half-life (~8.4 years) and a high short-term impact on global warming, significantly higher than CO2 (Kleinberg, 2020; Balcombe et al., 2018). Traditional metrics such as the 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP100) obscure methane's short-term, negative climatic effects, potentially leading to inadequate policy responses (Kleinberg, 2020). This letter examines the limitations of GWP100 in capturing methane's true climate impact, explores alternative metrics, and discusses the implications of underreporting methane emissions. We highlight the necessity of adopting a more immediate perspective on methane to accelerate climate emergency action, while noting the adverse effects of the rapid growth rate of methane emissions on reduction efforts. Additionally, we hope that in the immediate future, during COP29, policymakers will adopt actions that give appropriate attention to methane's short-term warming potential to dramatically reduce emissions and address the immediate climate crisis.</description>

                Multimetallic nanoalloy catalysts have attracted considerable interest for enhancing the efficiency and selectivity of many electrochemically driven chemical processes. However, the preparation of homogeneous bimetallic alloy nanoparticles remains a challenge. Here, we present a room-temperature and scalable, host&#8211;guest approach for synthesis of dilute Cu in Ag alloy nanoparticles. In this approach, an ionic silver bromide precursor harboring exogenous Cu cations is reduced to yield &#8764;20 nm diameter AgCu alloy nanoparticles wherein the % Cu loading can be tuned precisely. AgCu nanoparticles with a 5% nominal loading of Cu exhibit peak activity (&#8722;0.23 mA/cm2 normalized partial current density) and selectivity (83.2% faradaic efficiency) for CO product formation from electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 at mild overpotentials. These AgCu nanoalloys exhibit a higher mass activity compared to Ag- and Cu-containing nanomaterials used for similar electrocatalytic transformations. Our host&#8211;guest synthesis platform holds promise for production of other nanoalloys with relevance in electrocatalysis and optics.</description>

      <title>Emerging clean technologies: policy-driven cost reductions, implications
  and perspectives</title>

                Hydrogen production from water electrolysis, direct air capture (DAC), and synthetic kerosene derived from hydrogen and CO2 (`e-kerosene') are expected to play an important role in global decarbonization efforts. So far, the economics of these nascent technologies hamper their market diffusion. However, a wave of recent policy support in the United States, Europe, China, and elsewhere is anticipated to drive their commercial liftoff and bring their costs down. To this end, we evaluate the potential cost reductions driven by policy-induced scale-up of these emerging technologies through 2030 using an experience curves approach accounting for both local and global learning effects. We then analyze the consequences of projected cost declines on the competitiveness of these nascent technologies compared to conventional fossil alternatives, where applicable, and highlight some of the tradeoffs associated with their expansion. Our findings indicate that enacted policies could lead to substantial capital cost reductions for electrolyzers. Nevertheless, electrolytic hydrogen production at $1-2/kg would still require some form of policy support. Given expected costs and experience curves, it is unlikely that liquid solvent DAC (L-DAC) scale-up will bring removal costs to stated targets of $100/tCO2, though a $200/tCO2 may eventually be within reach. We also underscore the importance of tackling methane leakage for natural gas-powered L-DAC: unmitigated leaks amplify net removal costs, exacerbate the investment requirements to reach targeted costs, and cast doubt on L-DAC's role in the clean energy transition. Lastly, despite reductions in electrolysis and L-DAC costs, e-kerosene remains considerably more expensive than fossil jet fuel. The economics of e-kerosene and the resources required for production raise questions about the fuel's ultimate viability as a decarbonization tool for aviation.</description>

      <title>Vietnam&#8217;s energy-related carbon emissions projections for the shared socioeconomic pathways towards net zero emission: a system dynamic analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54337/ijsepm.8327</link>
      <description>Ho&#224;ng H&#224; &#194;nh, Tr&#7847;n Minh D&#7841; H&#7841;nh, International Journal of Sustainable Energy Planning and Management. 42(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403733900

                Vietnam, a rapidly growing economy with high energy demand, aims for net-zero emissions by 2050. This study employs a system dynamic model to analyze the complex dynamics of energy-related carbon emissions. Historical data from 1990 to 2020 and predictions up to 2050 under five shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios were used. Sensitivity analysis identifies GDP.PPP growth rate, energy intensity, and energy structure as key drivers of energy consumption and carbon emissions. Predictions show that energy consumption and emissions peak in SSP5, followed by SSP1, SSP2, SSP4, and SSP3. By 2050, Vietnam's energy consumption and carbon emissions are expected to peak at 16,536,323 TJ and 1001 Mt CO2, respectively. While all scenarios meet the 2030 emission targets, they fail to meet the 2050 targets, with SSP5 requiring the most significant emission reductions. Without robust policy interventions, Vietnam may struggle to achieve its net-zero emission goal, emphasizing the need to promote energy-efficient sectors and transition to renewable energy sources.</description>

      <title>Multi-pronged strategies for enhancing building envelopes toward nearly-zero energy in hot climatic regions</title>

                Abstract Growing concerns about climate change and rising energy demands necessitate advancements in building energy efficiency. This study investigates the effectiveness of radiative coatings and thermal insulation, both individually and combined, in reducing energy consumption and carbon footprint for buildings in hot and humid climates. This research contributes to a growing body of knowledge by comprehensively evaluating the combined effects of these strategies. A comparative analysis was conducted using data on energy usage and carbon emissions.&amp;#xD;The research highlights the effectiveness of envelope-enhancing techniques in reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions. The application of radiative coating led to a significant 13.1% decrease in energy usage, totaling 681.95 MWh, and corresponding emissions of 482.14 tons of CO2. Radiative coating offers the most cost-effective solution with an LCOS of $0.045/kWh. When integrating thermal insulation with radiative coating, there was a substantial 12.0% reduction in energy consumption, amounting to 690.39 MWh, and emissions of 488.11 tons of CO2. The integrated model provides significant energy savings at a slightly higher LCOS of $0.052/kWh, making it a balanced choice between efficiency and cost-effectiveness compared to using thermal insulation alone. Moreover, the study emphasizes that the combination of Glazing Integrated Photovoltaic (GIPV) with radiative coating can lead to the creation of nearly zero-energy buildings, resulting in a significant energy savings of 34.9%. These results underscore the efficacy of these technologies in achieving significant energy savings and environmental benefits.&amp;#xD;This study demonstrates that radiative coatings significantly reduce energy consumption and carbon footprints. The combined method with thermal insulation reduces energy, suggesting further optimization strategies in hot and humid conditions. The results of this investigation recommend utilizing Glazing Integrated Photovoltaic (GIPV) to achieve nearly zero-energy buildings. Such integrated solutions not only improve energy efficiency but also make a substantial contribution to environmental sustainability in the building sector.&amp;#xD;</description>

      <title>Preparation of nano Cu-Mo2C interface supported on ordered mesoporous biochar of ultrahigh surface area for reverse water gas shift reaction</title>

                Abstract High conversion rate and selectivity are challenges for CO 2 utilization through catalytic reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction. Herein, a novel mesoporous biochar (MB) supported Cu-Mo 2 C nano-interface was prepared by consecutive physical activation of coconut shells followed by carbothermal hydrogen reduction of bimetal. As compared with traditional carbon materials, this MB exhibited ultra-high specific surface area (2693 m 2 g &#8211;1 ) and mesopore volume of mesopore (0.81 cm 3 g &#8211;1 ) with a narrow distribution (2&#8211;5 nm), responsible for the high dispersion of binary Cu-Mo 2 C sites, CO 2 adsorption and mass transfer in the reaction system. Moderate carbothermal reduction led to the sufficient reduction of Mo ion with carbon matrix of MB and dispersive growth of nano Cu-Mo 2 C binary sites (~ 6.1 nm) on the surface of MB. Cu + species were formed from Cu 0 via electron transfer and showed high dispersion with simultaneous boosted bimetal loading due to the strong interaction between nano Mo 2 C and Cu. These were advantageous to the intrinsic activity and stability of the Cu-Mo 2 C binary sites and their accessibility to the reactant molecules. Under the RWGS reaction conditions of 500 &#176;C, atmospheric pressure, and 300,000 ml/g/h gas hour space velocity, the CO 2 conversion rate over Cu-Mo 2 C/MB reached 27.74 &#215; 10 &#8211;5 mol CO2 /g cat /s at very low H 2 partial pressure, which was more than twice that over traditional carbon supported Cu-Mo 2 C catalysts. In addition, this catalyst exhibited 99.08% CO selectivity and high stability for more than 50 h without a decrease in activity and selectivity. This study offers a new development strategy and a promising candidate for industrial RWGS. Graphical Abstract</description>

                Renewable energy sources, such as solar, hydro, wind, and geothermal energy, have emerged as key alternatives to fossil fuels in combating climate change and addressing energy security concerns in the USA and ad worldwide. Strategic use of this renewable resource is important not only for carbon emission reduction and improvement of environmental sustainability but also for maintaining future energy supplies. At the same time, such transition raises thorough assessments of environmental and socio-economic impacts. Machine learning (ML) models offer a powerful tool for predicting and analyzing such impacts, allowing for more efficient decision-making and long-term planning. These models are supposed to analyze patterns in energy production, land use, and emissions to make a more dynamic and predictive understanding of how renewable energy adoption influences CO2 levels. The principal aim of this research project was to develop and curate machine learning algorithms for predicting CO2 emissions based on renewable energy data, using the knowledge to better understand how solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy systems affect environmental outcomes. The predictive models developed in this research would serve as useful tools for the policymakers and major stakeholders in decision-making on investments in energy infrastructure and characterization of regulatory frameworks. These datasets for this research project were retrieved from several prominent institutions, including governmental agencies, international organizations such as the International Energy Agency-IEA and the World Bank, satellite data repositories, and USA environmental monitoring agencies. For this research project, 3 machine learning algorithms in the experiment were used, namely Logistic Regression, XG-Boost, and Random Forest. Amongst these three, the linear regression model gave the best performance, as it had the least MSE; indicating that its predictive capability was impressive. The comparative analysis of renewable energy projects in Germany, China, and California underlines that effective policy-making plays a very decisive role in the transition toward sustainable energy.</description>

                Abstract Oil extraction emits considerable amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG), which is the main driver of climate change, as GHG emissions trap heat in the atmosphere and contribute significantly to global warming and climate change phenomena. Climate change is a crucial challenge facing the globe that requires urgent and coordinated action from all countries. The United Nations took the lead in addressing climate change and its consequences, through various conventions, agreements and initiatives. The most important ones are the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2&#176;C above pre-industrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5&#176;C. In this endeavor, Egypt is committed to share in the implementation of climate actions. Accordingly, Egypt has prepared a national sustainable development strategy (Egypt Vision 2030) in alignment with the global agenda of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on climate change. The vision has set various indicators and targets to measure the progress of implementation, in which the target of increasing the share of renewable energy in electricity production to 37% by 2030 is proposed to limit the impact of climate change. Most recently, Egypt has organized the Conference of Parties (COP 27) in Sharm el-Sheikh with the aim of discussing and taking action regarding the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the progress of achieving SDGs. One of the main results of COP 27 is to call for accelerating the deployment of renewable energy resources. In that context and being aware of the climate change impacts potentially resulting from the operations of their assets, PetroFarah (PF) in a joint venture with Apex International Energy, and with the support of the Egyptian Petroleum Company (EGPC), has initiated a pilot project to utilize solar energy in the artificial pumping of oil in one of its operating wells. The project entailed the installation of a PV solar unit with a capacity of 72.9 kW, without a battery system, to operate a sucker rod pump (SRP) at Farah-8 well. The main aim of the project is to reduce the diesel consumption utilized in the diesel generator at the well location and subsequently, reduce the GHG emissions associated with the operation of the diesel generator. Calculations of GHG emissions from the pilot project indicated that implementing the PV solar project could save about 44% of generators&#8217; diesel consumption at well sites and subsequently 44% of GHG emissions resulting from the emissions of these generators. It should be pointed out that these results should be taken with caution, as the studied well is a small producer using a Sucker Rod Pump (SRP) working at a slow round per minute (RPM), while other wells may be working at different RPMs resulting in different fuel consumption. Also, the estimated GHG reduction is for one type of oil pumping system, which is SRP, and this case study could not be generalized for other types of pumps such as electrostatic submersible pumps (ESP). The estimated GHG reduction is based on the daily and annual consumption and production data obtained from 2022 data, which could be subject to change with the variation in production. The estimated GHG reduction is also based on the operation of the PV solar unit during the daytime, as the current setting does not include a battery for operating during night-time. Accordingly, the installation of a battery system may further reduce Scope 1 GHG emissions. Moreover, the efficiency of the diesel generator and power transmission is not taken as a factor in the provided estimate. Accordingly, variable savings could be obtained from the different diesel generators / SRPs connections depending on their efficiency. Overall, the pilot project was found to have the potential to have a net reduction of 0.5 kg CO2 eq. for each barrel of oil produced (bop) which is equivalent to approximately 50 tons of CO2 eq. for each 100,000 bop.</description>

      <title>Computational fluid dynamics: Its carbon footprint and role in carbon reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0217320</link>
      <description>Xiang I. A. Yang, Wen Zhang, Mahdi Abkar, William Anderson, Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy. 16(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403685132

                Turbulent flow physics regulates the aerodynamic properties of lifting surfaces, the thermodynamic efficiency of vapor power systems, and exchanges of natural and anthropogenic quantities between the atmosphere and ocean, to name just a few applications of contemporary importance. The space-time dynamics of turbulent flows are described via numerical integration of the non-linear Navier&#8211;Stokes equation&#8212;a procedure known as computational fluid dynamics (CFD). At the dawn of scientific computing in the late 1950s, it would be many decades before terms such as &#8220;carbon footprint&#8221; or &#8220;sustainability&#8221; entered the lexicon, and longer still before these themes attained national priority throughout advanced economies. The environmental cost associated with CFD is seldom considered. Yet, large-scale scientific computing relies on intensive cooling realized via external power generation that is primarily accomplished through the combustion of fossil fuels, which leads to carbon emissions. This paper introduces a framework designed to calculate the carbon footprint of CFD and its contribution to carbon emission reduction strategies. We will distinguish between &#8220;hero&#8221; and &#8220;routine&#8221; calculations, noting that the carbon footprint of hero calculations&#8212;which demand significant computing resources at top-tier data centers&#8212;is largely determined by the energy source mix utilized. We will also review CFD of flows where turbulence effects are modeled, thus reducing the degrees of freedom. Estimates of the carbon footprint are presented for such fully and partially resolved simulations as functions of turbulence activity and calculation year, demonstrating a reduction in carbon emissions by two to five orders of magnitude at practical conditions. Besides generating a carbon footprint, the community's effort to avoid redundant calculations via turbulence databases merits particular attention, with estimates indicating that a single database could potentially reduce CO2 emissions by approximately O(1) &#215; 106 metric tons.</description>

                General concept is proposed for a technology of purifying waste gases of TPPs and metallurgical enterprises from SO2 and CO2 . The fundamental possibility of carrying out the process of regeneration of carbonate-sulfate melt with natural gas is shown. Based on experimental work it has been established that the process of regeneration of a carbonate-sulfate melt with natural gas provides high rates of sulfate reduction and the achievement of maximum up to 99% sulfur recovery from the melt in the form of H2 S. It has been determined that the removal of sulfur from a carbonate-sulfate melt by bubbling with natural gas can be carried out in the operating temperature range of an absorption column for purifying exhaust gases as 500-550 &#186;&#1057;. It is shown that the process of regeneration of a carbonate-sulfate melt with natural gas is a relatively simple one-stage process that proceeds at a high rate. This allows the regeneration column to be integrated with an absorption column where sulfur is captured from the exhaust gases. The removal of sulfur in the form of H2 S provides considerable range of choice in terms of the final commercial product: either sulfuric acid (by dry combustion of H2 S) or elemental sulfur (by the Claus process), both have significant commercial value. The proposed method for the regeneration of a carbonate-sulfate melt simplifies the technology of purifying waste gases from sulfur dioxide with a carbonate melt of alkali metals. Moreover, it can be easily integrated into the general technological scheme of existing metallurgical enterprises without special material and energy costs.</description>

      <title>Modelling Nigerian residential dwellings: bottom-up approach and scenario analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5334/bc.452</link>
      <description>Chibuikem Chrysogonus Nwagwu, &#350;ahin Ak&#305;n, Edgar G. Hertwich, Buildings and Cities. 5(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403650024

                Nigeria&#8217;s residential buildings consume a substantial amount of the country&#8217;s energy, so achieving a net-zero building sector with a rapidly growing population is a key challenge. To bridge the gap in research at a national level and support Nigeria&#8217;s commitment to an unconditional 20% reduction in emissions by 2030, this study develops bottom-up archetype models of different residential building typologies to estimate the energy and material use of Nigerian residential buildings. This creates an overview of the residential stock and how different archetypes perform. The study calculates a baseline energy and material use of Nigeria&#8217;s residential building stock using the BuildME tool and converts these data into CO2 emissions using a life-cycle assessment. Scenarios are modelled for 2020. Nigeria&#8217;s residential dwellings use approximately 0.3 kt of material per dwelling over a lifetime of 50 years and 2404 kWh/yr of energy per dwelling. Annualised, dwellings emit 2500 kgCO2-eq per dwelling due to material and energy use. Scenarios proposed for meeting Nigeria&#8217;s emissions targets will require improved energy efficiency, decarbonising the building envelope through a shift in construction materials and decarbonising grid electricity. Policy relevance This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the energy and material use of residential buildings in Nigeria, focusing on achieving the country&#8217;s commitment to a 20% reduction in emissions by 2030. It employs a bottom-up approach to model energy and material use, revealing the peculiarities of the dwelling stock across Nigeria&#8217;s four climatic zones. The study explores the implications of different policy scenarios on sustainable housing. The research suggests that meeting Nigeria&#8217;s emissions targets requires improved energy efficiency, a shift in construction materials and decarbonisation of grid electricity. It also highlights the potential benefits of a policy switch to materials such as timber, earthen blocks, adobe bricks and clay, which could significantly reduce construction-related emissions. These changes could improve the quality of life of households in Nigeria, combat climate change on a global scale and bring economic advantages to Nigeria.</description>

      <title>A Study of Heat Recovery and Hydrogen Generation Systems for Methanol Engines</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17215266</link>
      <description>Sviatoslav Kryshtop&#1072;, Ruslans &#352;migins, Liudmyla Kryshtopa, Energies. 17(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403689707

                Biofuels are the most essential types of alternative fuels, which currently have significant potential to reduce CO2 emissions compared to fossil fuels. Methanol is a more efficient fuel than petrol due to its physicochemical properties, such as a higher latent heat of vaporization, research octane number, and heat of combustion of the fuel&#8211;air mixture. Also, biomethanol is cheaper than traditional petrol and diesel fuel for agricultural countries. The authors have proposed a new approach to improve the characteristics and efficiency of methanol diesel engines by using biomethanol mixed with hydrogen instead of pure biomethanol. Using a hydrogen&#8211;biomethanol mixture in modern engines is an effective method because hydrogen is a carbon-free, low-ignition, highest-flame-rate, high-octane fuel. A small quantity of hydrogen added to biomethanol and its combustion in an engine with a heat exchanger increases the combustion temperature and heat release, increases engine power, and reduces fuel consumption. This article presents experimental results of methanol combustion and a hydrogen-in-methanol mixture if hydrogen was retained due to the utilization of the heat of the exhaust gases. The tests were carried on a single-cylinder experimental engine with an injection of liquid methanol and gaseous hydrogen mixtures. The experiments showed that green hydrogen generated onboard the car due to the utilization of heat significantly reduced fuel costs of engines of vehicles and technological installations. It was established a hydrogen gaseous mixture addition of up to 5% by mass to methanol requires a corresponding change in the coefficient of excess air to &#955; = 1.25. Also, using an additional hydrogen mixture requires adjustment at the ignition moment in the direction of its decrease by 4&#8211;5 degrees of the engine crankshaft. Hydrogen gas mixture addition reduced methanol consumption, reaching a maximum reduction of 24%. The maximum increase in power was 30.5% based on experimental data. The reduction in the specified fuel consumption, obtained after experimental tests of the methanol research engine on the stand, can be implemented on the vehicle engines and technological installations equipped with an onboard heat recovery system. Such a system, due to the utilization of heat and the supply of additional hydrogen, can be implemented for engines that work on any alternative or traditional fuels.</description>

      <title>Advanced Pulsed Neutron Logging Behind Casing in Rig-Less Operations Enables Bypass Pay Identification and Hydrocarbon Quantification for Abu Qir in Offshore Egypt</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/223355-ms</link>
      <description>Renata Gomes, Maria Leticia Vazquez, Amr Labib, Mohamed El-Dabbour, Hany Shalaby, Khaled Elshater, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403587016

                Abstract Objectives/Scope This paper exemplifies how a sophisticated pulsed neutron logging technology has proven extremely valuable in locating and analyzing a gas-bearing reservoir in an environment with complex completions and low-formation water salinity. For oilfield operating companies, the most promising sources of future earnings are wells that have already been drilled and are producing. These wells must continue to produce at optimal economic rates throughout their lives. Understanding reservoirs' current fluid saturation situation is a pivotal step in planning a well workover to boost production when required. This understanding is often obtained through formation evaluation based on cased-hole (CH) logging. Traditionally, Abu Qir-ENERGEAN operations are conducted by offshore rigs. Mobilizing a jack-up rig without full assurance of economic gain is costly, inefficient, and increases the company's CO2 footprint. An existing targeted well comprises two reservoir sections; Abu-Qir is required to evaluate the potential of the reservoir situation and re-complete the well to add the upper reservoir section. The targeted well was crucial to the client, and the confirmation of bypassed hydrocarbon would be the client's trigger for re-completing the well. Due to the complexity of the environment, a new generation of pulsed neutron logging tool providing fast neutron cross-section measurement (FNXS) that is sensitive to gas volume was the best option for the job. Methods, Procedures, Process The proven strategy of employing an innovative pulsed neutron logging and interpretation technology lowers operational risks and costs as it could be deployed in a rig-less environment. A rich dataset was obtained, which included capture and inelastic elemental spectroscopy, fast neutron cross section (FNXS), and self-compensated sigma and neutron porosity logs. The logs were interpreted by combining the neutron porosity and FNXS with matrix characteristics and mineral dry weight fractions from elemental spectroscopy processing. Results, Observations, Conclusions The logging objectives were successfully met, and valuable information about the reservoir was determined efficiently in a rig-less environment. This allowed the operator to plan for the workover operations while reducing the cost of rig operations. The production of this well had significantly increased after the implementation of the workover plan. The collaboration and technical discussion to run the new generation pulsed neutron logging tool directly resulted in eliminating uncertainty in operations and reducing emissions, as the tool was deployed rig-less. This was also a great cost savings and a key de- risking factor for proceeding with the well activity, knowing that the hydrocarbon saturation still existed behind the casing. The direct results of running the new generation pulsed neutron logging tool rig-less were time-saving and accurate hydrocarbon estimation, which positively impacted suitability and resulted in a major reduction of CO2.</description>

      <title>Different Approaches for Hybridization Between Solid Oxide Fuel Cells and Internal Combustion Engines</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/power2024-138460</link>
      <description>Ahmed G. Elkafas, M. Rivarolo, Luca Mantelli, Stefano Barberis, Jos&#233; Col&#243;n Rodr&#237;guez, Nana Zhou, David Tucker, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403647392

                Abstract The paper explores the hybridization of Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) and Internal combustion Engine (ICE), It addresses design point analysis for SOFC-ICE hybrid system applications, considering the early adoption of technology. The study investigates different design cases for a 1 MW turbocharged SOFC-ICE system for marine applications in which the SOFC&#8217;s power contribution is fixed at 20% to reduce the risk and expenses associated with early technology adoption. The results show that the maximum efficiency of the SOFC-ICE system is 49.4% at 70% fuel utilization and 1.1% methane concentration at the anode inlet of SOFC. This integration provides an efficiency improvement of 5% over the standalone ICE. Moreover, the results demonstrated that the SOFC-ICE system might provide a maximum reduction in CO2 emissions of 17.6% over existing marine natural gas engines. However, the results prove the insensitivity of system efficiency to both SOFC fuel utilization and methane composition in the anode inlet. Because the system efficiency variation is no more than 1.41% or 1.1% when varying fuel utilization from 70% to 90% or varying methane concentration from 1.1% to 30.7%, respectively. Based on these findings, a SOFC-ICE hybrid system with complete external reforming and very low fuel consumption can be designed for optimal performance. Both would lengthen the SOFC stacks&#8217; lifetime and lower SOFC design complexity and cost. These results are compared to an optimized hybrid design for stationary applications where the SOFC represented between 78% and 93% of the total system power. Intuitively, optimizing the power split in the system design at the highest fuel utilization (90%) provides higher efficiencies by 13% than fixing the SOFC power share at 20%.</description>

      <title>Increasing Productivity and Fruit Quality of &#8216;Mutsu&#8217; Apple Orchard by Dwarfing Treatments</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14101838</link>
      <description>Maria Ma&#322;achowska, Tomasz Majak, Tomasz Krupa, K. Tomala, Agriculture. 14(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403585169

                The aim of this 2022 study was to evaluate the effect of tree growth-limiting treatments on the tree yield and quality of &#8216;Mutsu&#8217; apples. The experiment was established on 7-year-old trees on M.9 rootstock in a commercial orchard in Wilga near Warsaw. Growth-limiting treatments included unilateral root pruning, spraying the trees with Regalis Plus 10 WG at various times, and spraying with Flordimex 480 SL. Eight combinations were used, with four replicates of 20 trees per repetition. The measurements included fruit set, length of this year&#8217;s shoots, yield per tree, average fruit weight, and the size structure of the yield. The distinctive physiological status of the apples was assessed directly after harvest, directly after 8 months of storage under CA conditions (1.5% CO2, 1.5% O2, 1 &#176;C, &gt;92% RH) and after an additional 7 days of shelf-life. Spraying trees with Regalis Plus 10 WG from the balloon stage onwards, irrespective of the treatment with root pruning, was most effective in both inhibiting long-stem growth and increasing tree yield (by almost two times) by increasing the number of apples per tree. The growth response of long-stemmed apple trees to both unilateral root pruning and Ethephon spray was significantly lower than it was to Regalis Plus 10 WG spray and had relatively little effect on their yield. Regalis Plus 10 WG resulted in a clear reduction in average fruit weight (by about 100 g), which, in the case of the large-fruited cultivar &#8216;Mutsu&#8217;, should be seen as an advantage. Its application from the balloon stage onwards promoted higher apple firmness at harvest and after simulated handling preceded by long-term storage.</description>

      <title>Underwater Techniques in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy: Diving into the Depths</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16203535</link>
      <description>Sandro Sferrazza, Giulio Calabrese, Roberta Maselli, Rui Morais, Antonio Facciorusso, Georgios Mavrogenis, Roberto Di Mitri, Alessandro Repici, Marcello Maida, Cancers. 16(20)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403604675

                The endoscopic resection of gastrointestinal tract lesions embraces different types of techniques, ranging from conventional polypectomy/endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) to the field of third-space endoscopy, including endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), full-thickness resection and peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). Parallelly, the advent of underwater techniques has served as an add-on for both basic and advanced procedures, since its first report in 2012. We aimed to provide a comprehensive update on the state of the art about the feasibility of underwater basic and advanced techniques for GI endoscopy. Underwater EMR (U-EMR) has proved effective and safe in treating &gt; 10 mm sessile or flat or all-size recurrent colonic lesions. Conversely, although data show good effectiveness and safety for &lt;10 mm lesions, it is preferred when high-grade dysplasia is suspected, favouring cold snare polypectomy for all other cases. Moreover, promising data are emerging regarding the feasibility of U-ESD for difficult-to-resect colonic lesions. U-EMR represents a standard of care for treating &lt; 25 mm superficial non-ampullary duodenal epithelial tumours. Data regarding oesophageal, gastric and ampullary lesions remains limited to small cohorts. Finally, using water immersion for POEM has shown a reduction in procedure time compared to the CO2 insufflation technique for vessel coagulation, albeit in a single-centre experience. Based on these results, U-EMR has become a standard for treating intermediate-size colonic and non-ampullary duodenal lesions, as highlighted also in the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines. Promising results have been shown in third-space endoscopy studies, even though further prospective studies are awaited to standardise the technique for both ESD and POEM.</description>

                Abstract Background In preterm infants, application of negative pressure ventilation (NPV) may offer advantages to traditional methods of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP). In a pre-clinical model, we recently described the &#8220;NeoVest&#8221;, a system consisting of a sealed abdominal interface and a ventilator that applies NPV in synchrony and in proportion to the diaphragm electrical activity (Edi) (Beck 2022). In animals with loaded breathing, the Neovest allowed a 50% reduction in Edi, and demonstrated specific diaphragm unloading, without hemodynamic effects. The NeoVest system, and its interface, have yet to be evaluated in human infants. Objectives The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility of applying synchronized and proportional NPV with an abdominal interface in infants with respiratory distress. Design/Methods This is a prospective feasibility trial. The inclusion criteria were admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit with respiratory distress, birthweight&amp;gt;1.5kg, &amp;lt;6 weeks of age, FiO2 &amp;lt;0.35, clinically stable with no recent apneas and bradycardias, nCPAP &amp;lt;8 cm H2O and at least 48 hrs old, or post-extubation. After parental consent, the feeding tube was exchanged for a 6F &#8220;Edi catheter&#8221; (for feeding and measuring Edi), and sensors were placed (heart rate, oxygen saturation, transcutaneous CO2, and non-invasive blood pressure (BP)). Figure 1 shows the Neovest interface on a manikin. The five protocol steps were: nCPAP ON/NeoVest OFF (10 min), nCPAP ON/NeoVest ON (10 min), NO ASSIST (1 min), NeoVest only medium (10 min), NeoVest high (5 min), NeoVest low (5 min). Results Eight babies have been included to this point. The principal diagnoses were Respiratory Distress Syndrome and/or Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn. Mean weight was 2186&#177;480g and age 10&#177;8 days old. All babies tolerated the physical application of the vest. As shown in Figure 2, there was no significant difference in Edipk when the vest was placed (12.4&#177;5.5 vs. 11.1&#177;3.5 uV). During the period of no assist, Edipk was higher (18.8 &#177;7.3 uV) than nCPAP or NeoVest periods (p= 0.012), which were not significantly different from each other. Neural respiratory rate was the same for all periods tested. As per its design, the Neovest system delivered negative pressure in synchrony and in proportion to the Edi. Negative pressures applied (&#9633;PVEST) were -9&#177;4, -11&#177;4, and -7&#177;5 cmH2O (Figure 2) for the three NeoVest periods. All infants were clinically stable with no disruptions to vital signs. Conclusion Applying synchronized and proportional negative pressure with the NeoVest system was feasible and showed promise with regards to diaphragm unloading. Future studies are required to evaluate the NeoVest utility for longer periods and compared to other methods of respiratory support.</description>
