                Technological advances in motorized transportation are progressing rapidly, making motorized vehicles the main mode of transportation. The increasing number of motorized vehicles in society results in a significant increase in exhaust emissions. Combustion in vehicle engines is not always perfect, producing exhaust gases containing compounds harmful to human health, such as carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). This study investigates the effect of variations in piston dome shape on exhaust emissions in a 100cc internal combustion engine using RON 90 fuel. The goal is to find the optimal compression ratio to produce cleaner exhaust emissions. The research data are presented in tabular form and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and graphs. The results showed a significant reduction in CO and HC emissions at all engine speeds (1000, 2000, 4000, and 5000 rpm) with variations in piston dome shape. The reduction in CO emissions ranged from 55.07% to 85.73%, while the reduction in HC emissions ranged from 54.14% to 86.10%. These results suggest that variations in piston dome shape can be an effective solution to minimize harmful exhaust emissions in internal combustion engines.</description>

                Abstract As part of the reduction and elimination of anthropogenic emissions, carbon capture, and storage (CCS) has been applied in recent decades. One option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions GHG is to store carbon dioxide CO2 in deep saline aquifers. Due to their abundance and large capacity, deep saline aquifers make excellent storage sites due to their potential for long-term sequestration. In early 2006, in Salah Gas Krechba field in Algeria became the world's first onshore saline aquifer to begin sequestration. This paper will focus on new insights into surface CO2 monitoring. We will discuss the introduction of geochemical imaging as an emerging surface technique to monitor CO2, recently adopted to investigate and detect tracer gases leaks injected in 2007 from neighboring wells and the cap rock. In the following few pages, we will summarize the geochemical imaging survey process from the implementation design, samples signature measurement to chemical analysis using the sophisticated statistical geo-chemical methods in the final interpretation stage. As a conclusion, the comprehensive analysis of the geochemical data has allowed the Krechba team to investigate the CO2 leakage areas in the field and demonstrates to be an efficient valuable, and accurate method for CO2 monitoring</description>

      <title>The Impact of Economic Factors on Changing Carbon Emission Landscape in ASEAN With ARDL Approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.24002/kinerja.v28i2.8583</link>
      <description>Hasbi Hasbi, KINERJA. 28(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402849537

                This study aims to analyze the factors influencing carbon emissions in the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). The data used in this study covers the period from 1990 to 2021, utilizing the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) analysis method. All independent variables show a significant impact on carbon emissions in both the short and long term. This research provides evidence that factors such as urbanization, foreign direct investment, population, and economic growth significantly contribute to the increase in carbon emissions in ASEAN countries. The findings also validate the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis for carbon emissions in ASEAN countries. In other words, economic growth leads to a reduction in carbon emissions. The ASEAN region has experienced substantial economic growth over the past few decades. However, carbon dioxide (CO2) remains a socio-economic issue in the ASEAN region. The results of this study can be highly beneficial for policymakers in the region regarding sustainability and economic development.</description>

                This study examines the effects of methanol&#8211;diesel blends on the emissions of a diesel engine, concentrating on carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons (HCs), and particulate matter (PM). Using a single-cylinder four-stroke diesel engine at varying torque settings (2 N m&#8211;6 N m), significant reductions in CO, CO 2 , HC, and PM emissions were observed with increasing methanol content. CO emissions reduced by up to 81.8%, CO 2 by up to 64.2%, HC by up to 80.4%, and PM by up to 23.5% with the MD11 blend. NOx emissions initially increased but decreased by up to 20% at higher torques with the same blend. These results highlight the environmental benefits of methanol&#8211;diesel blends and the need for effective NOx reduction strategies.</description>

      <title>Impact of Energy Transition on the Factors Shaping International Oil and Gas Companies&#8217; Corporate Strategy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/221073-ms</link>

                Abstract Oil has played a crucial role in the global economy since its discovery in the mid&#8211;19th century. Due to technological advancements, oil became a crucial energy source in the 20th century, and its demand has risen in tandem with economic advancements since its discovery (Fattouh et al., 2019). Apart from oil being crucial for modern transportation, as the International Energy Agency (IEA, 2018, p. 12) stated, "most items created today, from apparel to autos to agricultural inputs to medical stockpiles are all derived from fossil&#8211; fuel by-products". As per OPEC (2004) estimates, over the 20th and into the 21st centuries, industrial production of oil increased by roughly fifty (50) folds. Hence, oil was dubbed as the "lifeblood" of modern civilisation, and affectionately referred to as the "black gold" by industry players. And during this period fossil&#8211;fuels (oil, gas and coal) have been the most critical energy source available globally (Bahgat, 2003).Fossil&#8211; fuels supplied more than 85% of the total energy supplied or consumed in 2019 globally (IEA, 2019).As a result of being crucial to modern society and a key energy source globally, oil and gas have become a huge geopolitical tool. Oil reserves, price, ownership, and accompanying riches all have had an impact on global economics and geopolitics. The Paris Accord is a legally binding global treaty on climate change that was signed by 196 territories to "limit global warming to below 2&#176;C, preferably 1.5&#176;C, in contrast to pre&#8211;industrial levels". To remain within the global carbon emission targets, a sturdy energy transition with a reduction in fossil&#8211;fuel demand is needed (Rogelj et al., 2019). The Accord should serve as motivation for IOCs to adapt their corporate strategies to the evolving ecosystem of the energy transition. But the IOCs&#8217; response, meanwhile, has been quite inconsistent up to this point. Some have refused to set concrete aims, and are spending more on initiatives that contradict the Paris goals and objectives (UNFCCC, 2016). Theenergy demand is expected to continue to rise as societies advance and citizens seek out an improved living standard.In 2017, energy demand soared, with fossil&#8211;fuels accounting for more than 80% of the energy mix.Hence, the want for "more energy and less carbon" is a doublesocial dilemma (BP, 2018: IEA, 2018). The emergence of issues regarding global warming, climate change, and the rise of the low&#8211;carbon economy has generated added pressure on states and corporations to reduce their carbon footprint (i.e. decarbonise) activities within their economies and corporations. It has become a change agenda to address issues regarding climate change, and this is due to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) from carbon&#8211; intensive fossil&#8211; fuel sources that have fuelled global economies for centuries. Hence,the need for profound changes to infrastructure, technologies, and behaviour to help reduce emissions. Failure to put these in place will escalate among others the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts on ecologies, that will threaten water security, livelihoods, agricultural production, and economic growth globally(OECD, 2013a; 2012).A prime example is the transition from a pre&#8211;industrial system built on water, traditional biomass, wind, and muscular ability to an industrial era marked by pervasive mechanisation, steam power, and coal (Grubler, 2012).This study aims to assess the shift in corporate strategy regarding factors arising due to the energy transition and how it is redefining corporate strategy. As stated, IOCs can't ignore energy transition, and corporate strategy is needed to adapt for future survival (Stevens, 2016).</description>

      <title>Applying Boundary Conditions for Large Aquifer Models in Geological CO2 Storage Projects; Why and How?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/220913-ms</link>
      <description>Yousef Ghomian, Matthew Bennett, Chris Skrivanos, Iryna Marchiano, Andrew Haynes, SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition. 44(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402668169

                Abstract Around the world many projects are being considered for the geological storage of CO2 in large saline aquifers. The aerial extent of pressure and saturation plume forecasts, known as Area of Review (AOR) in the United States, can have a significant impact on the monitoring costs and liabilities associated with existing legacy wells within the vicinity of the carbon storage projects. Appropriately modeling how aquifer systems react to large scale CO2 injection has relevance to potential geomechanical integrity, fault reactivation, seismicity, and impact on underground sources of drinking water (USDW). Static and dynamic models are generally built over a smaller portion of large saline aquifer system. This is typically tied to the balance between model size, fidelity, and computational expenses. Assigning the appropriate boundary conditions to replicate the true extent of the aquifer is investigated in this study. Scoping the aquifer's size, geology, and properties is an important step that allows for the quantification of the appropriate pore volume beyond the area of the numerical model. Results from our study indicate that using pore volume (PV) multipliers is a reasonable approach if accompanied by transmissibility reduction at the interface between the PV modifications and the reservoir model. A simple model was developed to create the true solution for comparison and verification purposes. Based on the results of this study, we find that using a combination of PV and transmissibility multipliers replicates the true solution more accurately. We demonstrate that large PV adjustments without transmissibility reductions overestimates the true aquifer strength, resulting in overall lower pressures due to large-scale CO2 injection. We demonstrate a systematic methodology for calculating the simultaneous PV increase and transmissibility reduction that scales easily for a wide range of scenarios. Further investigation shows that as the PV multiplier grows large, the approach of reducing the transmissibility with a single multiplier starts to choke off the large added pore volume. This study proposes an innovative approach which demonstrates that applying a gradually increasing PV multiplier combined with gradually reducing transmissibility is a more accurate representation of the true aquifer system when compared to a single large PV multiplier and a single transmissibility reduction. The proposed approach was applied to large 3-D models and significant impact was observed in pressure diffusion front shape and extent when compared to more simplified approaches. Assignment of boundary conditions for a variety of different scenarios were also investigated in this study. It was shown that this novel approach will be the most accurate method of applying appropriate boundary conditions in obtaining reliable AOR forecasts when modeling large aquifer systems for CO2 storage projects.</description>

      <title>Eco-Friendly Drilling: Evaluating the Impact of Engineered High-Performance Water-Based Mud on Emissions and Waste</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/220869-ms</link>
      <description>Mohammed Bageri, Travis Vordick, SPE Annual Technical Conference and Exhibition. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402668135

                Abstract The oil and gas industry are under increasing pressure to minimize its environmental footprint, with drilling fluids being a significant contributor to operational emissions and waste. Traditional Oil-Based Muds (OBMs), despite their effectiveness in drilling operations, pose substantial environmental risks due to their disposal challenges and high carbon footprint. In response, High-Performance Water-Based Muds (HPWBMs) have been developed, promising reduced environmental impact and improved performance. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of HPWBMs in reducing emissions and waste while maintaining operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The primary objective of this research is to compare the environmental and economic impacts of HPWBMs and OBMs through comprehensive field trials and laboratory tests. By analyzing drilling performance, cost-per-lateral-foot, waste management, and emissions, this study seeks to establish HPWBM as a viable and sustainable alternative to OBMs in the oil and gas industry. Field trials were conducted in North Central Texas and the Permian Basin, involving the drilling of 26 wells&#8212;13 using HPWBM and 13 using OBM. The North Central Texas case study focused on an operator's challenge of drilling 10,000-15,000&#8217; lateral wells at TVDs of 3,800-4,800&#8217;. In the Permian Basin, Wolfcamp horizontal wells were drilled to evaluate performance. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as drilling fluid cost, lateral cost per foot, and days per well were measured. Emissions were calculated using a carbon calculator, and laboratory tests assessed rheological properties, lubricity, and thermal stability. The results indicated that HPWBM systems not only reduced drilling costs by 18.2% but also significantly lowered CO2 emissions and hazardous waste generation. In the North Central Texas case study, the use of HPWBM resulted in cost savings of over $100,000 per well, with significant reductions in disposal costs, OBM logistics, base-fluid costs, motor realignment fees, and pit cleaning expenses. The environmental footprint and carbon emissions were notably reduced, with CO2 emissions for HPWBM wells averaging 386.1 metric tons compared to 710 metric tons for OBM wells. In the Permian Basin, the average fluids cost per foot for HPWBM wells was $6.02 compared to $7.04 for OBM wells, and the average number of lateral days was reduced to 4.92 days compared to 11.50 days for OBM wells. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of HPWBMs, demonstrating their superior environmental and economic performance over traditional OBMs. The significant reduction in CO2 emissions and hazardous waste, combined with cost savings and improved operational efficiency, highlights the potential of HPWBMs to transform drilling practices in the oil and gas industry. The findings support the broader adoption of HPWBMs, promoting sustainable and cost-effective drilling operations that align with global sustainability goals.</description>

      <title>Effects of Mischmetal Composition and Cooling Rates on the
  Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Al-(Ce, La, Nd) Eutectic Alloys</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2408.14489</link>
      <description>Jovid Rakhmonov, Erin C. Bryan, David C. Dunand, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402703840

                This study investigates the substitution of cerium (Ce) with mischmetal (MM) in cast Al-MM alloys, focusing on microstructure, hardness, tensile and compression properties, creep resistance, and coarsening resistance. Al-MM alloys with various MM compositions (Ce, Ce-50La, Ce-33La, and Ce-27La-19Nd, weight percent) exhibit near-eutectic and hyper-eutectic microstructures for Al-9MM and Al-12MM compositions, respectively, with similar as-cast hardness (~525 MPa). All Al-9MM alloys show tensile yield stress ~55 MPa, ultimate tensile strength ~130 MPa, and fracture strain ~8%.The microstructural and mechanical properties consistency demonstrates the flexibility of MM compositions in Al-MM alloys. Al-9MM exhibits excellent coarsening resistance, with minimal hardness reduction when exposed to 300 and 350 C for up to 11 weeks, and a modest ~15% hardness reduction at 400 C for 8 weeks, outperforming eutectic Al-12.6Si and Al-6.4Ni alloys. Additionally, Al-9MM shows higher creep resistance at 300 C compared to most precipitate-strengthened Al-Sc-Zr and solid-solution-strengthened Al-Mg/Mn alloys, but is outperformed by eutectic-strengthened Al-6.4Ni and Al-10Ce-5Ni alloys.The effect of casting cooling rate is investigated through wedge casting: Al-9Ce transitions from hypo- to hyper-eutectic as cooling rates decrease, while Al-12Ce consistently shows hyper-eutectic microstructures. Al11Ce3 lamellae become finer and more closely spaced with increasing cooling rates. Al-9Ce maintains steady hardness at high to moderate cooling rates but shows reduced hardness at lower rates, whereas Al-12Ce shows no change in hardness.With a 15% reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions, Al-Ce alloys where Ce is replaced with MM offer comparable mechanical properties and enhanced environmental benefits, highlighting the potential of MM as a sustainable alternative.</description>

                Green Building Materials (GBMs) are construction materials Green building materials (GBMs), sustainable building practices, resource conservation, energy efficiency, indoor air quality, environmental impact reduction, and renewable and recyclable materials. The drive to adopt GBMs is fueled by the need to reduce energy consumption, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and preserve natural resources. By incorporating renewable, recyclable, and non-toxic elements, GBMs are integral to sustainable building practices, ensuring a balance between development and environmental responsibility. Growing awareness of environmental challenges and the emphasis on sustainable development have made green building materials a central focus in contemporary construction. Environmental Impact Reduction: GBMs help decrease the environmental footprint of construction by cutting waste, cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and using less energy. These minerals are essential for maintaining ecosystems and halting climate change. Health &amp; Well-Being: Research on GBMs makes it easier to create materials that improve indoor air quality and reduce exposure to dangerous pollutants, which benefits building occupants' comfort and health. Resource Conservation: This study promotes the use of recyclable and renewable materials, helping to preserve the planet's finite natural resources and encouraging the building sector to implement circular economy principles. Alternatives taken as Bamboo, Recycled Steel, Cork, Rammed Earth, Hempcrete, Straw Bale. Evaluation Parameters taken as Thermal Insulation (Benefit), Sustainability Score (Benefit), Cost per Square Meter (Non-Benefit), CO2 Emissions during Production (Non-Benefit). The results indicate that Recycled Steel achieved the highest rank, while Straw Bale had the lowest rank being attained. &#8220;The value of the dataset for Green Building Materials, according to the VIKOR, Recycled Steel achieves the highest ranking.&#8221;</description>
