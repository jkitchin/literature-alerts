                Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) has the potential to adequately contribute to addressing the energy and environmental challenges faced by the humanity today. The surplus of CO 2 produced by burning fossil fuels can be transformed into valuable products by CO 2 RR. An effective use of this approach on a large scale requires active, selective, and stable CO 2 reduction electrocatalysts. Additionally, insightful understanding of interfacial behavior such as water wetting and carbonate formation at the electrode is required to enhance the performance and durability of CO 2 RR electrocatalysts. 1 Atomically dispersed Ni-N-C materials have attracted attention due to their superior selectivity for CO generation. 2 Their activity and selectivity of CO 2 RR are influenced by the metal center and local atomic defects in M-N-C catalysts. 3 In addition to catalyst structures, electrode composition and structure have also substantial impact on the activity and selectivity of CO 2 RR. Particularly, ionomer compositions and the electrode fabrication process can alter the hydrophobicity of the electrode and the local pH on the catalyst, resulting in considerable changes in CO 2 RR activity and selectivity. In this presentation, we will report on the performance of various electrodes fabricated with the Ni-N-C catalyst, using different types of ionomers and measured in a flow cell and zero-gap electrolyzer at &gt; 100 mA/cm 2 current densities for CO 2 RR. We will also introduce an approach that aims at reducing carbonate formation at the CO 2 RR electrolyzer cathode by the modifications to the electrolyte composition, the CO 2 inlet humidity, and the electrochemical cell temperature.

                In the context of clean energy and green chemical production, the two-phase flow electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to formate has gained considerable interest, and efforts are being made to scale up the process [1] . With respect to electrode design, unlike in the simpler single-phase system, which is limited by the solubility of CO 2 in the electrolyte and by the mass transport of the dissolved CO 2 gas from the bulk of the electrolyte to the cathode surface [2] , mixed gas/liquid flow in the trickle bed reactor [3] or segregated flow in the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) [4] reactor provide more efficient gas delivery at the catalyst/electrolyte interface. This enhanced the overall mass transfer coefficient and enabled higher reaction rates per unit geometric area of the electrodes, providing that the electrocatalyst layer's intrinsic activity and selectivity are established. Due to the limitation in retaining the effective electroactive bed thickness in the trickle bed reactor [3] , GDEs are preferred for high current density operations (typically above 100 mA cm -2 ). Despite the continuous gas transport mechanism, the reported performance in the GDE-based system lies around 200 mA cm -2 , with occasional reports above 200 mA cm -2 but on a tiny electrode area (typically 1 cm 2 or below) [5] . The flooding of the GDE porous structure is believed to be the prime cause that limits electrode durability at high current density. Here, we present the optimization of the two-phase flow dynamics and the GDE (with 20 cm 2 geometric area) operating conditions to enable high current density operation up to 500 mA cm -2 using a tin-based catalyst layer and scalable reactor design. The performance was compared with other catalytic materials that were intrinsically active for CO 2 RR to formate. References [1] M.F. Philips, G.M.Gruter, M.T.M. Koper and K.J.P.

      <title>Electrochemical and Photoelectrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide on Ruthenium-Cultured Bacterial Biofilms</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-01422371mtgabs</link>
      <description>Pawe&#322; J. Kulesza, Ewelina Seta-Wiaderek, Iwona A. Rutkowska, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-01(42)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401697157

                Most of the bacterial species form biofilms, in which microorganisms are attached to a surface and they are held together by extracellular polymeric substances that they produce. They tend to grow almost everywhere both on living or non-living surfaces. Biofilms are able to propagate charge within their structures and to transfer effectively electrons at interfaces, as well as they could exhibit electrocatalytic properties (e.g. in Microbial Fuels Cells). The application of microbes provides better flexibility: experiments with fuel cells can be operated at normal conditions (temperatures and pressures). Wide variety of microbial metabolic pathways gives the possibility to use aggregates of bacteria in diverse processes. Proposed electrochemical studies using bacterial biofilms (in the form of thin coatings on the glassy carbon electrodes) can be considered as an attempt to find efficient methods of using the energy produced by microorganisms and converting it to electricity. The ultimate goal of the present research has been to determine whether it is possible under laboratory conditions to perform electrocatalytic processes using the hybrid (composite) layers composed of aggregates of bacteria in pristine or modified forms. A biofilm formed by a strain of Yersinia enterocolitica ( Y. enterocolitica ) is characterized by a high physicochemical stability over a wide pH range (4-10) and temperatures (0-40&#176;C).The subject of interest is a fairly complex reaction, electroreduction of carbon dioxide. There has been growing interest in the search of electrocatalytic anf photoelectrochemical systems capable of efficient conversion of carbon dioxide into fuels and utility chemicals. Our previously performed studies have clearly shown that the Y. enterocolitica biofilm itself has no activity with respect to reduction of CO 2 , however it acts as a good matrix for the catalytic (e.g. noble metal or metaloorganic) centers, because it affects the reaction mechanism and appears to decrease overpotential of the electroreduction processes. The conducted research shows that the composite materials containing bacterial biofilms can be successfully used to construct systems that have an electrocatalytic reactivity in the reduction of carbon dioxide. We will also address the possibility of dispersing the organometallic ruthenium (II) complex in the biological layer (biofilm). Indeed, the ruthenium (II) complex has been immobilized in the biofilm matrix by successive modification of the liquid medium ( Luria-Bertani medium) for culturing bacteria with a solution of the complex compound. In addition, the biological matrix was used (along with the ruthenium (II) complex molecules dispersed in its layer) as a protective coating, stabilizing the unstable p -type semiconductor - copper (I) oxide. The proposed hybrid co-catalytic system showed activity during the photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide and stability under semi-neutral experimental conditions. Finally, we are going to address the design of the above-mentioned catalytically active systems emphasizing the need to control the structure of the studied hybrid materials (in addition to their stability). Among important issues is the viability of bacteria in the biological membrane as well as elucidation of the role of the bacterial biofilm during the carbon dioxide reduction.</description>

                There were 40 million cows in the US in 2020 which provide necessary protein-rich food and are integral to the US economy. However, . Currently manure is managed simply by storing and spreading to nearby cropland as a fertilizer to reuse nutrients. Given the high water content and low nutrient concentration of manure, effective approaches to recover nutrients from manure wastewater and reduce greenhouse gas emissions are needed. Our group has recently developed ammonia (potassium) recovery from manure wastewater and co-production of chemicals using nutrient-selective redox material 1 . I will report my progress toward developing a new electrochemical strategy to achieve integrated ammonium (and potassium) nutrient recovery from manure wastewater and simultaneous biogas upgrading by electrochemically reducing carbon dioxide to formate and other locally useful products. This project will effectively mitigate CO 2 emissions in traditional manure processing and provide a sustainable strategy for resource recovery, distributed electrosynthesis of fertilizers and other value-added chemicals, paving the way to carbon-neutral agriculture.

                Iron porphyrins are molecular catalysts recognized for their ability to electrochemically and photochemically reduce carbon dioxide (CO2). The main reduction product is carbon monoxide (CO). CO holds significant industrial importance as it serves as a precursor for various valuable chemical products containing either a single carbon atom (C1), like methanol or methane, or multiple carbon atoms (Cn), such as ethanol or ethylene. Despite the long&#8208;established efficiency of these catalysts, optimizing their catalytic activity and stability and comprehending the intricate reaction mechanisms remain a significant challenge. This article presents a comprehensive investigation of the mechanistic aspects of the selective electroreduction of CO2 to CO using an iron porphyrin substituted with four trimethylammonium groups in the para position [(pTMA)FeIII&#8208;Cl]4+. By employing infrared and UV&#8208;Visible spectroelectrochemistry, changes in the electronic structure and coordination environment of the iron center can be observed in real&#8208;time as the electrochemical potential is adjusted, offering new insights into the reaction mechanisms. Catalytic species were identified, and evidence of a secondary reaction pathway was uncovered, potentially prompting a re&#8208;evaluation of the nature of the catalytically active species.</description>

      <title>IONIC LIQUIDS AS POTENTIAL CO-CATALYST FOR CO2 ELECTROCHEMICAL REDUCTION</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.22452/mjs.vol43sp1.9</link>

                Carbon dioxide electrochemical reduction (CO2ER) presents numerous advantages in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions by converting CO2 into value-added chemicals and can be integrated with renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. Nevertheless, establishing an electrochemically stable catalytic system that can effectively decrease the overpotential while maintaining high current density and faradaic efficiency is challenging. The precise mechanisms causing the reactions and the specific functions of the electrode with electrolytes are still not fully understood. Hence, a significant increase in attention has been paid to using ionic liquids (ILs) as electrolytes for CO2ER. This phenomenon is attributed to the unique capabilities of ILs to reduce overpotential, increase current density, and improve electrochemical stability. Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of incorporating ILs into electrolytes to comprehend the cation and anion influences on CO2ER reactions. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry (CA) were employed to examine the reduction peaks and current density values for different electrolytes, respectively. Consequently, a 0.1 M NBu4PF6 acetonitrile solution containing 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate [EMIM][BF4] demonstrated a significantly lower onset potential of the reduction by 320 mV. A reduced CO2ER efficiency involving ILs with long alkyl chains was also observed. Meanwhile, a novel hypothesis concerning molecular orbitals for the CO2ER reaction mechanism was discussed. Overall, various performance variables (reduction stability, applied potential, and current density) of CO2ER were improved using cations with short alkyl chains, anions with high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, and appropriate solvation media. These findings can serve as selection criteria to aid in choosing appropriate ionic liquids for CO2 electrochemical reduction (CO2ER).</description>

                Renewable electricity shows immense potential as a driving force for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) in production of formate (HCOO&#8208;) at industrial current density, providing a promising path for value&#8208;added chemicals and chemical manufacturing. However, achieving high selectivity and stable production of HCOO&#8208; at industrial current density remains a challenge. Here, we present a robust Bi0.6Cu0.4 NSs catalyst capable of regenerating necessary catalytic core (Bi&#8208;O) through cyclic voltammetry (CV) treatment. Notably, at 260 mA cm&#8208;2, faradaic efficiency of HCOO&#8208; reaches an exceptional selectivity to 99.23%, maintaining above 90% even after 400h, which is longest reaction time reported at industrial current density. Furthermore, in stability test, the catalyst was constructed by CV reconstruction to achieve stable and efficient production of HCOO&#8208;. In 20h reaction test, the catalyst has a rate of HCOO&#8208; production of 13.24mmol m&#8208;2 s&#8208;1, a HCOO&#8208; concentration of 1.91mol L&#8208;1, and an energy consumption of 129.80kWh kmol&#8208;1. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy reveals the formation of Bi&#8208;O structure during the gradual transformation of catalyst from Bi0.6Cu0.4 NBs to Bi0.6Cu0.4 NSs. Theoretical studies highlight the pivotal role of Bi&#8208;O structure in modifying the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates, which further reduces energy barrier for *OCHO conversion in CO2RR.</description>

                The conversion of CO 2 into liquid fuels, using only sunlight and water, offers a promising path to carbon neutrality. An outstanding challenge is to achieve high efficiency and product selectivity. Here, we introduce a wireless photocatalytic architecture for conversion of CO 2 and water into methanol and oxygen. The catalytic material consists of semiconducting nanowires decorated with core&#8211;shell nanoparticles, with a copper-rhodium core and a chromium oxide shell. The Rh/CrOOH interface provides a unidirectional channel for proton reduction, enabling hydrogen spillover at the core&#8211;shell interface. The vectorial transfer of protons, electrons, and hydrogen atoms allows for switching the mechanism of CO 2 reduction from a proton-coupled electron transfer pathway in aqueous solution to hydrogenation of CO 2 with a solar-to-methanol efficiency of 0.22%. The reported findings demonstrate a highly efficient, stable, and scalable wireless system for synthesis of methanol from CO 2 that could provide a viable path toward carbon neutrality and environmental sustainability.</description>

                Visible light&#8208;active photocatalysts play a crucial role in gas&#8208;phase photocatalytic CO2 reduction, offering significant potential for sustainable energy conversion. Herein, we present the synthesis of spindle&#8208;shaped Iron (Fe)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) MIL&#8208;88A, coupled with distinct &#945;&#8208;Bi2O3 nanospheres. The &#945;&#8208;Bi2O3/MIL88A heterostructure is formed by interacting opposite surface charges, enhancing visible&#8208;light absorption and efficient interfacial charge&#8208;carrier separation. Such low&#8208;cost photocatalysts have a 1.75 eV band gap and demonstrate enhanced efficacy in converting CO2 to CO, CH4, and H2 in water without using any sacrificial agents or noble metals compared to pristine MIL88A. In addition, in situ Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) analyses revealed that these unique catalysts combination promoted enhanced interfacial charge dynamics, creating efficient trapping sites for photogenerated carriers. Further, in&#8208;situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transfer Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) investigation elucidates the plausible reaction mechanism and provides an effective methodology for catalyst screening for CO2 photoreduction. This study offers an effective approach for synthesizing the earth&#8208;abundant heterostructure from metal oxide and low&#8208;cost MOFs, enhancing photocatalytic activity for sustainable carbon dioxide conversion into invaluable chemicals.</description>

                Abstract Quantifying regional health disparities linked to air pollution is essential for enhancing air quality and attaining carbon neutrality objectives. Nonetheless, the efficacy of proactive policies in ensuring equitable health protection in China's Eastern Coastal Area (ECA) remains uncertain. Here, we employed an integrated assessment model to assess the combined reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and atmospheric pollutants and their health repercussions in the ECA of China. Our findings reveal that 273,000 premature deaths are attributable to air pollution in 2060 in the ECA in the absence of mitigation policies. Conversely, carbon reduction policies are poised to curtail 80% of CO2 emissions, alongside reductions of 76% for NOx, 79% for SO2, 80% for PM2.5, 72% for VOCs, and 66% for NH3 emissions. Air pollution control policies could mitigate premature deaths by 19,600, while carbon reduction policies could potentially lower them by 50,800. The health inequality coefficient among provinces stands at 0.19, primarily attributable to significantly higher mortality rates in Hebei and Shandong. These findings yield valuable insights for crafting synergistic abatement strategies in similarly imbalanced developmental regions grappling with comparable environmental challenges.</description>

      <title>Effect of Electrolyte Composition over CO2 Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-01442411mtgabs</link>

                The rapid utilization of fossil fuels escorted by an excess of CO2 emissions has led to global energy and environmental crisis. Therefore, the necessity for a clean, renewable and sustainable source of energy is a growing concern for the present and future society. In this regard, economically viable CO2 reduction would be a critical turnover in research, as it has the potential to fulfil a substantial need for clean energy. However, even though many efforts have been done in this field, there is still room for improvements concerning efficiency, material stability, and catalytic enhancement in regard of kinetics and selectivity. Herein, we provide the experimental proof for enhancement of the CO2 reduction efficiency and selectivity from the SEI (semiconductor-electrolyte interface) side through the use of carbonates, borates, sulphates and alkali cations as the electrolyte as well as an overview of the latest developments on Cu2O based PEC CO2 reduction for solar fuel production. Cu2O is a low-cost semiconductor and one of the most promising candidates for PEC CO2RR. However, its stability and performance is still unsatisfactory, thus the CO2 reduction products vary from one investigated system to another, such as: CH3OH, CO, HCOOH, CH3COOH, and CH3CH2OH. Moreover, the instability of Cu2O causes it, to be rarely used for the routine CO2 reduction reaction. In this paper, we use a very facile electrodeposition method, which offers a high level of reproducibility and the possibility of using a new electrode in each experiment, in order to focus our efforts on following the phenomena occurring in the double layer during the photocatalytic run. In this way, we were able to correlate the final CO2RR performance with a reorganization of the cations and anions near the photocatalyst surface. It is shown in the literature that factors such as: carbonate concentration, local pH, the presence of alkali metal cations, the geometry of the anionic group, CO2 solubility, conductivity, as well as pH changes along with the number of H+ in the electrolyte, play a significant role in regulating the partial CO2RR current. In this paper, we would like to shed new light on the influence of the electrolyte composition, cation-anion interaction and local reaction environment around the catalyst on the performance of CO2RR. We found out that the specific interaction between the alkali cation and the anionic group of particular geometry contributes to the formation of a kind of a &#8220;rigid layer&#8221; within the double diffusion, close to the photocatalyst surface layer, which accounts more for an apparent CO2RR current than the decrease in the finite Warburg element, which is a central key parameter for the diffusion coefficient values. The effectiveness of the strength of the cation-anion interaction in the formation of the &#8220;rigid layer&#8221; around the photocatalyst surface is found to increase the PEC CO2RR performance. Elucidating this mechanism provides useful information for creating further experimental design and the new pathways for addressing highly efficient PEC CO2RR systems. The authors have noticed a significant knowledge gap in the existing literature, as no prior publications have delved into the concurrent and combined impact of both cations and anions on PEC CO2RR. In this pioneering publication, we present the inaugural investigation of this this intricate phenomenon.</description>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) into valuable chemicals represents an effective approach for realizing carbon neutralization goals. Copper oxide&#8208;derived catalysts are particularly promising due to their tunable electronic structures. In this study, we focused on investigating the Ag2Cu2O3 model catalyst and a mixture of CuO and Ag2O with an identical metal molar ratio (denoted an M&#8208;CuAgO). Electrochemical CO2RR tests revealed that Ag2Cu2O3 exhibited selectivity towards ethanol, while M&#8208;CuAgO showed no selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products. Characterizations of the post&#8208;reaction materials showed differences in the specific crystal structures of the two catalysts. Further X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis demonstrated that the Ag2Cu2O3 structure, after the reaction, facilitated the transfer of electrons from Cu to Ag, thereby promoting the formation of multi&#8208;carbon products. This work underscores the significance of structural design in precatalysts and opens up new avenues for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts.</description>

                The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) or carbon monoxide (CO) to commodity fuels and chemicals, empowered by low-carbon electricity, has attracted much attention as an alternative to conventional routes of chemical production [1]. Numerous studies have focused on CO 2 reduction to CO or formic acid and active/efficient electrocatalysts with high Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) have been developed [2]. However, CO 2 reduction to higher value C 2+ products needs the critical C-C coupling step, and to date, Cu has been the main electrocatalyst for this conversion [3]. Electrochemical carbon monoxide reduction (CORR) to C 2+ products has advantages over electrochemical CO 2 conversion (CO 2 RR) as issues such as carbonation, and CO 2 loss during CO 2 RR are omitted in CORR due to the stability of CO in alkaline solutions. Facing common challenges as CO 2 RR, CORR suffers more from mass transport resistance and intrinsically lower aqueous CO solubility. Therefore gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs) are desired to boost the formation of triple phases and active sites to obtain higher reaction rates. Herein for the first time we design Cu-based HFGDEs for efficient CORR to C 2+ products with ethylene as the main product. The pristine Cu HFGDEs showed low selectivity towards C 2+ products. Therefore, we tuned the Cu catalyst shape morphology and orientated growth of nanocubes on the outer surface of HFGDEs by electrodeposition. Due to the efficient C-C coupling and high C 2+ _ selectivity of copper nanocubes with dominant Cu(100), the HFGDEs showed exceptionally high current densities in the 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, outperforming conventional GDEs tested for CORR under similar conditions. Compared with CO 2 RR in a bicarbonate medium, significantly higher current densities and FEs of C 2+ products (&gt;90%) and ethylene (&gt;65%) were achieved when the HFGDE were used for CORR. Moreover, lower partial current densities of C 2+ were obtained when using the hollow fibers in the non-GDE mode, confirming the significant performance of HFGDEs for achieving high-rate and selective CO reduction through maximizing triple-phase interfaces and local CO concentration. By increasing the concentration of KOH, an ethylene partial current density of 472 mA cm 2- was obtained using the flow-cell reactor, indicating the promises of HFGDEs as an emerging electrode configuration for efficient CORR to C 2+ products.

                The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;RR) represents a promising strategy for CO&#8322; mitigation, requiring highly efficient catalysts integrated into electrochemical devices to achieve high conversion rates and energy efficiencies for desired products. Establishing a gas diffusion electrode is crucial for practical applications of CO&#8322; electrochemical reduction reactions (CO&#8322;RR). This study uses the air-spraying method to immobilise nano-catalysts onto a gas diffusion layer (GDL) with exceptional homogeneity. A composite of copper(I) oxide (Cu&#8322;O) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles in a 4:1 ratio was deposited onto the GDL. Surface morphology analysis revealed the successful immobilisation of cubic Cu&#8322;O and hexagonal wurtzite ZnO with a uniform distribution, indicating potential improvements in CO&#8322;RR performance. Contact angle measurements were conducted to assess surface hydrophobicity, comparing pristine GDL with Cu&#8322;O/ZnO-based GDL. Although the contact angle on the surface of the Cu&#8322;O/ZnO-based GDL slightly reduced from 143.69&#176; to 134.82&#176;, it maintained its hydrophobic nature. This reduction is attributed to Nafion, a binder in the catalyst ink mixture. The sustained high contact angle is crucial for the CO&#8322; reduction reaction process. X-ray diffraction (XRD) diffractograms of Cu&#8322;O/ZnO-based GDL were compared with reference Cu&#8322;O, ZnO, and bare GDL. The presence of all essential peaks confirms the successful immobilisation. The air-spraying technique effectively achieved a favourable distribution of active metals.</description>

                Bi&#8208;based electrocatalysts have attracted high attention due to their high selectivity for formate, low cost, and high biocompatibility. Surface modification with halides can adjust the surface charge distribution of metal catalysts, thereby regulating the binding force of the intermediate. Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid bismuth halides provide an alternative, especially low dimensional structures. Herein, zero&#8208;dimensional hybrid bismuth halides containing Bi4I16 units (denoted as Bi4I16) was recommended as pre&#8208;catalyst due to the Bi&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Bi spacing in Bi4I16 is 4.760 &#197;, nearly equaling to the Bi&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Bi spacing in rhombohedral Bi (4.750 &#197;). The equal spacing may be more beneficial for the electricity&#8208;driven in situ conversion and rearrangement of Bi atoms in the catalytic process. As a contrast, zero&#8208;dimensional bismuth halide containing Bi2I9 units (denoted as Bi2I9) with shorter Bi&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Bi spacing (4.2415 &#197;) was prepared. The working electrode prepared by Bi4I16 ink was measured for CO2RR, and the partial formate current density can reach 8.2 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1 V vs RHE. The Bi4I16 catalyst delivers a maximum Faradaic E&#64259;ciency (FE, ~80%) for formate at &#8722;0.86 V vs RHE and maintain a FE higher than 78.5% after 16 h.</description>

      <title>Research on Cu-Site Modification of g-C3N4/CeO2-like Z-Scheme Heterojunction for Enhancing CO2 Reduction and Mechanism Insight</title>

                In this work, the successful synthesis of a Cu@g-C3N4/CeO2-like Z-scheme heterojunction through hydrothermal and photo-deposition methods represents high CO2 reduction activity with remarkable CO selectivity, as evidenced by the impressive CO yield of 33.8 &#956;mol/g for Cu@g-C3N4/CeO2, which is over 10 times higher than that of g-C3N4 and CeO2 individually. The characterization and control experimental results indicate that the formation of heterojunctions and the introduction of Cu sites promote charge separation and the transfer of hot electrons, as well as the photothermal effect, which are the essential reasons for the improved CO2 reduction activity. Remarkably, Cu@g-C3N4/CeO2 still exhibits about 92% performance even after multiple cycles. In situ FTIR was utilized to confirm the production of COOH* at 1472 cm&#8722;1 and to elucidate the mechanism behind the high selectivity for CO production. The study&#8217;s investigation into the wide-ranging applicability of the Cu@g-C3N4/CeO2-like Z-scheme heterojunction catalysts is noteworthy, and the exploration of potential reaction mechanisms for CO2 reduction adds valuable insights to the field of catalysis.</description>

                Bio-energy systems with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) will be essential if countries are to meet the gas emission reduction targets established in the 2015 Paris Agreement. This study seeks to carry out a thermodynamic optimization and analysis of a BECCS technology for a typical Brazilian cogeneration plant. To maximize generated net electrical energy (MWe) and carbon dioxide CO2 capture (Mt/year), this study evaluated six cogeneration systems integrated with a chemical absorption process using MEA. A key performance indicator (gCO2/kWh) was also evaluated. The set of optimal solutions shows that the single regenerator configuration (REG1) resulted in more CO2 capture (51.9% of all CO2 emissions generated by the plant), penalized by 14.9% in the electrical plant&#8217;s efficiency. On the other hand, the reheated configuration with three regenerators (Reheat3) was less power-penalized (7.41%) but had a lower CO2 capture rate (36.3%). Results showed that if the CO2 capture rates would be higher than 51.9%, the cogeneration system would reach a higher specific emission (gCO2/kWh) than the cogeneration base plant without a carbon capture system, which implies that low capture rates (&lt;51%) in the CCS system guarantee an overall net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in sugarcane plants for power and ethanol production.</description>

                The electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising realisation of negative emissions to mitigate climate change, aiming at the efficient production and safe longterm storage of carbon-rich sink products. This approach, however, necessitates novel catalyst materials specifically targeting electrochemical carbon dioxide removal. In this work, we investigate synthesis routes for a cerium-incorporated GaInSn-based liquid metal catalyst, focusing on the electrochemical production of graphitic carbon. Preparation and preconditioning of the catalyst are found to be crucial for carbon production, while trace amounts of H2O and OH in the organic electrolyte play a decisive role for the efficiency of the electrocatalytic process. Finally, for a better understanding of the reaction mechanism and the involved active species, experimental findings and density functional theory-based calculations are combined, suggesting a two-step reduction pathway with Ce(OH)x as the catalytically active surface species.</description>

                The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) into higher-value materials is crucial for addressing escalating levels of greenhouse gases in Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Employing first-principles methods, we investigated the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and CO on two Fe-based MOFs: Fe2DOBDC and Fe2DSBDC. By directly comparing these MOFs, we aimed to discern the impact of introducing S atoms into the framework without changing the topological framework. Several chemical properties such as electronegativity, atomic radius, polarizability, and charge density are expected to lead to significant changes for the reduction reactions upon the replacement of O atoms with S atoms. CM5 atomic charge analysis highlights some of these differences by showing the equatorial Fe-O/S bonds of Fe2DSBDC are less polarized and result in smaller positive and negative charges on the Fe and O/S atoms, respectively. Additionally, the larger S atoms are expected to weaken adsorbate binding due to less favorable van der Waals interactions near the open-metal Fe site. Consequently, the less electropositive Fe site and the larger S atoms of Fe2DSBDC impede the adsorption of reduced CO2 and CO products, while the more electropositive Fe site and smaller O atoms of Fe2DOBDC strongly favor product adsorption. This implies that CO2 and CO reduction on Fe2DSBDC is likely to yield only 2e- products (HCOOH and CH2O, respectively), whereas Fe2DOBDC is expected to produce deeper reduction products (CH2O and CH4, respectively). This insight offers a foundation for constructing novel MOFs with tunable reaction behaviors by strategically replacing O atoms with heavier S atoms in the MOF scaffold.</description>

                The reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into value-added feedstock materials, fine chemicals, and fuels represents a crucial approach for meeting contemporary chemical demands while reducing dependence on petrochemical sources. Optimizing catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction can entail employing first principles methods to identify catalysts possessing desirable attributes, including the ability to form diverse products, selectively form few products, or exhibit favorable reaction kinetics. In this study, we investigate the CO2 reduction reaction on bimetallic Cu paddlewheel complexes, aiming to understand the impact metal substitution with Mn, Co, or Ni has on bimetallic paddlewheel metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Substituting one of the Cu sites of the paddlewheel complex with Mn results in a more catalytically active Cu center, poised to produce substantial quantities of formic acid (HCOOH) and minor quantities of methane (CH4) with a suppressed production of C2 products such as ethanol (CH3CH2OH) or ethylene (C2H4). Moreover, the presence of Mn significantly reduces the limiting potential for CO2 reduction from 2.22 eV on the homo-bimetallic Cu paddlewheel complex to 1.19 eV, thereby necessitating a smaller applied potential. Conversely, within the Co-substituted paddlewheel complex, the Co site emerges as the primary catalytic center, selectively yielding CH4 as the sole reduced CO2 product, with a limiting potential of 1.22 eV. Notably, the Co site faces substantial competition from H2 production, attributed to a lower limiting potential of 0.81 eV for hydrogen reduction. Our examination of the Cu-Ni paddlewheel complex, featuring a Ni substituent site, reveals two catalytically active centers, each promoting distinct reductive processes. Both the Ni and Cu sites exhibit a propensity for HCOOH formation, with the Ni site favoring further reduction to CH4, while the Cu site directs the reaction towards methanol (CH3OH) production. The significance of this study lies in its potential to inform and streamline future experimental efforts, facilitating the synthesis and evaluation of novel catalysts with superior capabilities for CO2 reduction.</description>

                Abstract Carbon storage in soils is important in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the sensitivity of the soil-carbon turnover time (&#964;soil) to temperature and hydrology forcing is still not fully understood. Here, we use radiocarbon dating of plant-derived lipids in conjunction with reconstructions of temperature and rainfall from an eastern Mediterranean sediment core receiving terrigenous material from the Nile-River watershed to investigate &#964;soil in subtropical and tropical areas during the last 18,000 years. We find that the &#964;soil was reduced by an order of magnitude over the last deglaciation and infer that this reduction was caused from amplified soil respiration rates. Our data indicate that the deglacial warming was the major driver of these changes while the impact of hydroclimate was relatively small. We conclude that increased CO2 efflux from soils into the atmosphere constituted a positive feedback to global warming. However, simulated glacial-to-interglacial changes in a dynamic global vegetation model underestimate our data-based reconstructions of soil-carbon turnover times suggesting that this climate feedback might be underestimated.</description>

                Plant responses to changing environments afford complex regulation at transcriptome and proteome level to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Homeostasis itself constitutes a complex and dynamic equilibrium of metabolic reactions and transport processes among cellular compartments. In the present study, we aimed at the highest possible resolution of this network by combining analysis of transcriptome, proteome and subcellular resolved metabolome of plants exposed to rising carbon dioxide concentrations over a time course of one week. To prove suitability of our approach, we included mutants affected in photorespiratory metabolism and, thus, should deviate from the wildtype in their response to elevated CO2. Our multi-omics analysis revealed that the hpr1-1 mutant, defective in peroxisomal hydroxypyruvate reduction, is also affected in cytosolic pyruvate metabolism, reaching out to cysteine synthesis, while the hexokinase mutant hxk1 displays a disturbed redox balance upon changing CO2 levels. For the third mutant, defective in the mitochondrial protein BOU, we found compelling evidence that the function of this transporter is related to lipoic acid metabolism, thus challenging current interpretations. This demonstrates that the combined omics approach introduced here opens new insights into complex metabolic interaction of pathways shared among different cellular compartments.</description>

      <title>The impact of the European Union emissions trading system on carbon dioxide emissions: a matrix completion analysis</title>

                Despite the negative externalities on the environment and human health, today's economies still produce excessive carbon dioxide emissions. As a result, governments are trying to shift production and consumption to more sustainable models that reduce the environmental impact of carbon dioxide emissions. The European Union, in particular, has implemented an innovative policy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by creating a market for emission rights, the emissions trading system. The objective of this paper is to perform a counterfactual analysis to measure the impact of the emissions trading system on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. For this purpose, a recently-developed statistical machine learning method called matrix completion with fixed effects estimation is used and compared to traditional econometric techniques. We apply matrix completion with fixed effects estimation to the prediction of missing counterfactual entries of a carbon dioxide emissions matrix whose elements (indexed row-wise by country and column-wise by year) represent emissions without the emissions trading system for country-year pairs. The results obtained, confirmed by robust diagnostic tests, show a significant effect of the emissions trading system on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions: the majority of European Union countries included in our analysis reduced their total carbon dioxide emissions (associated with selected industries) by about 15.4% during the emissions trading system treatment period 2005&#8211;2020, compared to the total carbon dioxide emissions (associated with the same industries) that would have been achieved in the absence of the emissions trading system policy. Finally, several managerial/practical implications of the study are discussed, together with its possible extensions.</description>

                This study examines the impact of supercritical fluid treatment on 1200V 4H-SiC vertical double diffusion MOSFETs (VD-MOSFETs). When exposed to pure carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide mixed with nitrous oxide, there is a significant increase in the improvement ratio of drain current, which is contingent upon channel mobility but has no effect on threshold voltage. Conversely, the degradation of drain current caused by ammonia gas treatment is attributed to a reduction in channel mobility. Furthermore, the treatment with pure carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide mixed with nitrous oxide effectively passivates shallow defects, while the presence of hydrogen atoms in ammonia gas leads to an increase in shallow defects.</description>

      <title>Metal-Organic Framework-Based Electrodes for Efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electroreduction to Formate at High Current Densities (up to 1 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;)</title>

                Achieving efficient CO 2 electroreduction for production of valuable chemicals requires affordable, stable, and non-toxic catalysts. One of the most studied and promising products of CO 2 reduction is formic acid/formate. The latter species is receiving increased attention as an energy vector [1] or energy storage media (e.g., in CO 2 redox flow batteries [2]). At present, the practical application of CO 2 reduction to formate still faces challenges due to the lack of electrocatalysts capable of operating at high current densities (&gt; 200 mA cm &#8722;2 ) with low degradation over long-duration operation [3]. Traditional metallic catalysts like Bi, Sn, In or Pb when scaled in flow cells typically suffer from low faradaic efficiencies (&lt; 70%) at current densities &#8805; 200 mA cm -2 , coupled with inadequate durability [4]. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) present promising and thus far largely unexplored attributes as electrocatalysts for CO 2 reduction, including high atom utilization during catalysis due to their porous crystal structure and tunable pore size distribution [5,6]. However, they also face challenges related to high overpotentials and complex synthesis methods [7]. This study elucidates the efficacy of a Bi metal-organic framework (Bi-MOF) synthesized through a rapid and facile method. The Bi-MOF obtained by our proprietary novel method [8], exhibits exceptional catalytic performance. Notably, it demonstrates outstanding faradaic efficiencies towards formate (FE HCOO - = 95&#8211;100%) at current densities up to 1 A cm &#8722;2 in a gas diffusion electrode, at low catalyst loading (0.5 mg cm &#8722;2 ). Moreover, Bi-MOF displays extended stability, operating continuously for over 20 hours at an industrially relevant current density (200 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and without electrolyte (1.5 M KOH) replenishment. In a flow reactor with 10 cm 2 electrode geometric area, a 100% FE HCOO - was obtained during 2-hour electrolysis at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 across a broad pH range (8&#8211;14). The electrochemical testing of the Bi-MOF was supplemented by surface and structural characterizations to correlate the activity with structural features. This analysis unveiled the role of the organic framework and the reason why Bi-MOF surpasses other Bi-based catalysts, including commercial Bi 2 O 2 CO 3 , Bi 2 O 3 , and metallic Bi, in selectivity (FE), cell potential, and durability. These findings hold promise for further scale-up of CO 2 reduction to formate using the cost-effective and easily prepared Bi-MOF catalyst.

                The development of technologies and processes to decarbonize chemical and fuel production is key to reducing global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction enables a sustainable pathway to circularize carbon-based chemical products by upgrading recovered carbon dioxide using renewable energy sources. Electrochemical CO 2 reduction has successfully been employed to produce chemicals such as methanol and ethylene, but it has been hindered by dependence on elevated temperature to achieve high yields and limited ability to generate higher order carbon products. Non-thermal carbon dioxide plasma can be generated at ambient temperature and pressure and contains energetically excited oxygen and carbon species. When introduced to an electrocatalyst, these reactive species could more readily participate in reaction pathways with higher activation barriers towards forming higher order carbon species compared to electrochemical reactions involving ground-state reactants. Further, plasma discharges over water in an electrochemical cell generate plasma-activated water, introducing solvated electrons and secondary reactive oxygen species. In this work, we investigate how the use of plasma-activated carbon dioxide and a plasma-water interface impacts electrochemical product generation. We design a novel non-thermal plasma electrode to discharge carbon dioxide plasma into water in an electrochemical cell with a Cu nanoparticle electrocatalyst. Results suggest the potential for a plasma-water electrochemical system to generate value-added products that are less commonly generated in electrochemical processes at ambient pressure and temperature.</description>

                Electrochemical production of hydrocarbons provides a pathway for connecting renewable energy generation with chemical production. In this work, we present research on the targeted electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to ethylene, which has a global production volume of over 200 metric tonnes per year. The selectivity of carbon dioxide to ethylene is heavily dependent on cell architecture, surface interfaces, and operating conditions. We explore the tradeoffs of using a zero-gap cell design, and demonstrate the production of ethylene with greater than 30% selectivity at 200 mA/cm2 with an uncompensated full cell voltage of 2.7 V. We also present modifications to a copper catalyst cathode, and the effects of conditioning and variable operation on the electrochemical cell performance including selectivity and durability. Leveraging technoeconomic analyses, we will present the projected costs of this pathway for producing ethylene and conclude with a discussion on long-term operation failure modes which greatly impact the future feasibility of this technology.

                Chemelectronics LLC has developed economical approach to use solar energy to convert CO 2 directly captured from air using carbon dioxide capture conductive sorbent materials coated on carbon foam electrodes into chemical products (ethylene) and oxygen from nick foam electrodes separated with solid polyelectrolytes. We take advantage of commercial off-the-shelf solar panels as electricity to supply the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 directly captured from air into chemical products with zero carbon emission. Based on the life cycle analysis, there is no CO 2 emission from CO 2 capture and conversion. The energy will be produced from solar panels.</description>

                Carbon dioxide reduction has emerged as a highly promising area of focus, particularly considering the perpetual CO 2 emissions from the industrial sector. The electrochemical reduction pathway stands out as one of the most auspicious methodologies for CO 2 utilization, owing to its compelling attributes. These include, but are not limited to, operation under mild conditions, the ability to tailor CO 2 conversion towards desired products, and the potential for seamless integration with renewable electricity sources (e.g., derived from solar and wind), thus offsetting the associated carbon footprint. Moreover, the application of magnetic fields has demonstrated effectiveness in numerous electrocatalytic reduction processes. Presently, there is a paucity of literature addressing the utilization of magnetic fields for CO 2 reduction, as it represents a recently introduced concept. This presentation aims to contribute to the advancement of this novel idea, paving the way for its scalability in the near future. Our focus is on addressing mass transfer limitations and optimizing the process to handle high current density, thereby rendering it viable for large-scale CO 2 reduction.</description>

      <title>A CO2-Modified Surfactant for Chemical Flooding</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/218177-pa</link>

                Summary Carbon dioxide (CO2) modification of a nonionic surfactant alkyl polyglycoside (C-APG) was conducted based on a commercial APG product under mild synthesis conditions, including a low temperature (50&#176;C) and a low pressure (2.5 bar). Using this method, CO2 was incorporated into APG molecules through the formation of carbonyl structures. The effectiveness and performance of C-APG as a novel surfactant for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) application in carbonate reservoirs were investigated and compared with its precursor&#8212;the unmodified APG. The key factors in the chemical structure of C-APG were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to confirm successful CO2 modification. The properties, including compatibility, surface tension, wettability alteration, interfacial tension (IFT), phase behavior, and static and dynamic adsorption of both APG and C-APG, were evaluated by various techniques and methods. Crude oil displacement efficiency of the surfactants was investigated via spontaneous imbibition, visualized micromodel, and coreflooding tests, respectively. Both surfactants were compatible with a high-salinity water (HSW), they exhibited a similar critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 8.5 mg/L and 13.5 mg/L for APG and C-APG, respectively, and had the same contact angle of around 135&#176;. Interestingly, C-APG was found more effective in reducing IFT between oil and water phases. The IFT of oil in the C-APG solution was 0.058 &#177;0.001 mN/m, one order of magnitude lower than the value of 0.47 &#177;0.02 mN/m obtained from the solution of original APG, suggesting a better performance of C-APG in chemical flooding for oil displacement. A Winsor Type I microemulsion was formed by APG within the salinity range, while a transition of Type I to Type II microemulsion was observed for C-APG. The static adsorption of APG and C-APG at 2 g/L in carbonate were 0.93 mg/g rock and 1.08 mg/g rock, and the adsorption decreased to 0.11 mg/g rock and 0.13 mg/g rock under dynamic conditions for APG and C-APG, respectively. The spontaneous imbibition test demonstrated a higher oil imbibition recovery of 18.0% from C-APG solution compared to the result of 10.2% obtained from APG solution. A micromodel test showed that more crude oil was displaced by injection of APG or C-APG solution after waterflooding, while C-APG injection exhibited a stronger emulsification. The oil displacement by coreflood test showed that C-APG injection led to a lower differential pressure and a higher cumulative oil production (48%) compared to APG chemical flooding with a cumulative oil production of 41%. The produced fluids containing displaced crude oil from C-APG flooding, and subsequent waterflooding demonstrated very strong emulsification compared to the fluids produced after APG injection. This study demonstrates the significant potential of C-APG in two aspects&#8212;CO2 reduction and chemical EOR for the upstream petroleum industry.</description>

                Water oxidation is an important reaction that produces electrons and protons, which are important for downstream reactions such as hydrogen production and carbon dioxide reduction. Presently, the slow water oxidation is a key limiting factor for the development of hydrogen production and/or carbon dioxide reduction into practical solar energy storage technologies. An important reason for the slow progress in solve water oxidation problems is the lack of knowledge on the detailed mechanisms by which water is oxidized. As a multi-step process, the reaction involves at least 4 protons and 4 holes (when the desired product is oxygen gas). Intuitively, the coordination of charges and protons plays a critical role, but the details remain unknown. In this talk, we report our recent progress in understanding how water oxidation is influenced by surface hole behaviors. Using an Ir-based catalyst that features atomically defined structures, we were able to systematically vary a number of parameters, including the hole concentration, the density of active sites, as well as the properties of the supporting substrate that determines hole accumulation. It was found that matching the concentrations of surface holes and active site densities is critical. It was also revealed that the support substrate could have a profound influence on the reaction kinetics, even though they do not directly participate in the reactions. This knowledge is expected to propel the development of catalysts for improved water oxidation under photochemical conditions.</description>

                Tailoring the structure of the electrified interface and the electrocatalytically active sites at the atomic and molecular levels is key to elucidating the design principles to develop advanced materials for sustainable energy conversion and storage. This talk will focus on recent strategies to tune the structure-activity-selectivity relationships for oxygen, carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide and methane electrocatalysis to produce renewable fuels. First, I will present our work toward understanding and tuning the structure-property relations for oxygen evolution for the production of green hydrogen in proton exchange membrane water electrolysers. Then, I will show our model studies on well-defined Cu-based surfaces to understand structure-properties relations for the electrochemcial CO 2 reduction reaction. We have investigated the effect of electrolyte, pH, and potential dependence for CO reduction on Cu single crystals as well as methods to evaluate the facet distribution on Cu-based catalysts. Finally, I will discuss some strategies for selective oxidation reactions such as partial oxidation of methane to produce liquid fuels such as methanol.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal plasma-catalytic processes for CO2 conversion toward circular economy: fundamentals, current status, and future challenges</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-024-34751-3</link>
      <description>Ahmad Mukhtar, Sidra Saqib, Dinithi Mohotti, Robinson Ndeddy Aka, Md. Mokter Hossain, Ekow Agyekum-Oduro, Sarah Wu, Environmental Science and Pollution Research. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401843849

                Abstract Practical and energy-efficient carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) conversion to value-added and fuel-graded products and transitioning from fossil fuels are promising ways to cope with climate change and to enable the circular economy. The carbon circular economy aims to capture, utilize, and minimize CO 2 emissions as much as possible. To cope with the thermodynamic stability and highly endothermic nature of CO 2 conversion via conventional thermochemical process, the potential application of non-thermal plasma (NTP) with the catalyst, i.e., the hybrid plasma catalysis process to achieve the synergistic effects, in most cases, seems to promise alternatives under non-equilibrium conditions. This review focuses on the NTP fundamentals and comparison with conventional technologies. A critical review has been conducted on the CO 2 reduction with water (H 2 O), methane (CH 4 ) reduction with CO 2 to syngas (CO + H 2 ), CO 2 dissociation to carbon monoxide (CO), CO 2 hydrogenation, CO 2 conversion to organic acids, and one-step CO 2 &#8211;CH 4 reforming to the liquid chemicals. Finally, future challenges are discussed comprehensively, indicating that plasma catalysis has immense investigative areas.</description>

      <title>Laser-Assisted Preparation of TiO2/Carbon/Ag Nanocomposite for Degradation of Organic Pollutants</title>

                The ever-increasing expansion of chemical industries produces a variety of common pollutants, including colors, which become a global and environmental problem. Using a nanocatalyst is one of the effective ways to reduce these organic contaminants. With this in mind, a straightforward and effective method for the production of a novel nanocatalyst based on lignin-derived carbon, titanium dioxide nanoparticles, and Ag particles (TiO2/C/Ag) is described. The preparation of carbon and Ag particles (in sub-micro and nano size) was carried out by laser ablation in air. The nanocomposite was synthesized using a facile magnetic stirrer of TiO2, C, and Ag. According to characterization methods, a carbon nanostructure was successfully synthesized through the laser irradiation of lignin. According to scanning electron microscope images, spherical Ag particles were agglomerated over the nanocomposite. The catalytic activities of the TiO2/C/Ag nanocomposite were tested for the decolorization of methylene blue (MB) and Congo red (CR), employing NaBH4 in a water-based solution at 25 &#176;C. After adding fresh NaBH4 to the mixture of nanocomposite and dyes, both UV absorption peaks of MB and CR completely disappeared after 10 s and 4 min, respectively. The catalytic activity of the TiO2/C/Ag nanocomposite was also examined for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) using a NaBH4 reducing agent, suggesting the complete reduction of 4-NP to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) after 2.30 min. This shows excellent catalytic behavior of the prepared nanocomposite in the reduction of organic pollutants.</description>

                Abstract With the Pan-European TIMES-VTT model, we studied pathways for carbon neutrality by 2050 for 31 European countries by modelling a large portfolio of varius terrestial and technological carbon dioxide removal (CDR) strategies. Negative emission technologies and practices (NETPs) such as af-/reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, direct air capture and storage, biochar, and enhanced weathering, were considered. Three different storylines were created to describe the role for NETPs in varying future developments. The scenario storylines illustrated potential opportunities and constraints for a large scale NETP implementation focusing on 1) optimistic technology development, 2) strict protection of planetary boundaries, and 3) increased self-sufficiency due to geopolitical risks with policy fragmentation. The results show that the demand for NETPs could be in a gigaton scale to reach carbon neutrality in Europe by 2050. As different countries have different opportunities to implement NETPs, none of the NETP options should be excluded from mitigation portfolios at this stage. The results also indicate the potential of NETPs in providing cost-effective solutions for achieving the climate targets. On the other hand, stricter greenhouse gas emission reduction polices are needed to avoid over-reliance on CDR.&amp;#xD;</description>

      <title>How Mechanical Challenges Affect the Performance of Industrial Scale Carbon Dioxide Electrolyzer Cells?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-01372155mtgabs</link>
      <description>Egon Kecsenovity, Dorottya Hurs&#225;n, Csaba Jan&#225;ky, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-01(37)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401700440

                One of the most important challenge of humanity in the mid-21st century is to maintain economic growth in an environmentally sustainable way. The European Green Deal addresses this issue, and it aims at making Europe climate neutral by 2050. To reach this aim, a promising technology is to convert a greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide into valuable chemicals (produce e.g., energy carriers, fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals) in an environmentally and economically sustainable manner, such as the utilization of renewable energy sources. The direct electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide into carbon-monoxide (a high-value product which can be readily used in the chemical value chain) is a promising waste-to-wealth approach among the developed technologies and it can be easily coupled with carbon-free electricity sources to make the process completely sustainable. Novel catalysts, electrode assemblies, and cell configurations are all necessary to achieve economically appealing performance, as well as finding technological solutions that enable scale-up to reach industrially relevant dimensions. Zero-gap electrolyzer cell technology operates with high reaction rates and good efficiencies under ambient and near ambient conditions. In addition, its operation is simpler compared to other types of carbon-dioxide electrolyzer cell technologies (just one example: there is no need very precisely pressure control because no flowing catholyte inside the cell), and this allows the scale up of such architectures. Exploring the fundamentals and understanding of the chemistry in zero-gap electrochemical cells is carried out by many research groups, usually with small experimental test cells. These results provide a good scientific basis (e.g., to select the right catalysts, components, or to study long-term degradation, etc.), however, compared to the size of an industrial-scale electrolyzer, these experimental cells only measure a "one point" chemistry. The results cannot be transferred without careful consideration during scale-up, due to several additional challenges. These challenges are mainly of mechanical origin, and all of these create uneven conditions that can significantly affect the chemistry of the on given sections of the cells. Over the past several years, we have gone through the steps of scaling up electrochemical cells (for CO 2 -to-CO conversion) from a small experimental test cell (8 cm 2 ) to an industrial-sized cell stack (2500 cm 2 / cell). During the development journey we encountered many of the challenges outlined above. In this talk, I am going to present some of these challenges, their origins, what affects them and by them, and what principles can be used to find solutions.</description>

                Abstract A building block containing eight zincs and eight iodo groups (8 Zn) is obtained by the Zn complexation of a salen ligand bearing two additional hydroxy groups. Through the Sonogashira&#8211;Hagihara coupling of 8 Zn with 1,3,5,7&#8208;tetra(4&#8208;ethynylphenyl) adamantane, microporous organic polymers bearing octanuclear zinc clusters (MOP&#8208;8 Zn) are prepared, exhibiting a high surface area of 562 m 2 g &#8722;1 , microporosity, and a particulate morphology with an average diameter of 249 nm. The MOP&#8208;8 Zn exhibits significantly enhanced catalytic performance, compared to molecular counterparts, in the reductive carbon dioxide fixation to formamides, possibly due to the cooperative adsorption and confinement effect of networks on substrates.</description>

                The widespread challenges facing lithium-sulfur batteries, including the low electrical conductivity of sulfur and its species, electrode volume fluctuations during cycling, and the lithium polysulfides shuttle effect, have hindered their commercialization and practical utility [1,2]. Our study addresses these issues by incorporating titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticles onto high specific surface area porous carbon, exploring this composite's potential as both a sulfur cathode host and separator modifier. The synthesis of the carbon/TiN composite involved two key stages: firstly, the in-situ growth of titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanoparticles on the carbon surface utilizing titanium tetrachloride as a precursor; secondly, the conversion of the TiO 2 nanoparticles to TiN nanoparticles through carbothermal nitridization (thermal treatment at 1400 &#8451; for 4 hours in a nitrogen medium) [3,4]. The lithium-sulfur cell employing the prepared C/TiN-25%@S cathode exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 1155 mAh g -1 at 0.2 C, maintaining a capacity exceeding 700 mAh g -1 after 100 cycles. Notably, the lithium-sulfur cell utilizing the C/TiN-25%@S cathode and a C/TiN-modified separator demonstrated enhanced cycling performance, delivering an initial discharge capacity of 1623 mAh g -1 with retention of over 1126 mAh g -1 after 100 charge/discharge cycles at 0.2 C.

      <title>Borohydride Compounds Catalyze the Selective 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; Reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with 9-BBN</title>

                The selective double hydroboration of CO2 into bis(boryl)acetal (BBA) is a challenging yet appealing reduction process since BBA can be used as a versatile C1 and Cn sources for the synthesis of value-added products. In the present study, we demonstrate that simple borohydride compounds are efficient and selective catalysts for the synthesis of BBA when using 9-borabicyclo(3.3.1)nonane (9-BBN) as a reductant. The experimental and theoretical investigations show that while the borohydride species catalyzes the first reduction step of CO2 into formoxyborane (2e&#8211; reduction intermediate), the observed 4e&#8211; reduction selectivity is mostly due to the ability of 9-BBN to reduce the formoxyborane into BBA without a catalyst. Notably, 0.2 mol % of LiH2BBN catalyzed the hydroboration of CO2 with 9-BBN as a reductant into the corresponding BBA in 77% yield with TON and TOF of 385 and 196 h&#8211;1, respectively. The simplicity of borohydride contrasts with the more elaborate catalytic systems used so far for the 4e&#8211; reduction of CO2.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction to Methane with Remarkably High Faradaic Efficiency in the Presence of a Proton Permeable Membrane</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-01442417mtgabs</link>

                The combustion of fossil fuels is a major contributor to rising levels of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere. Due to the adverse effects of climate change caused in large part by CO 2 , new technologies must be developed that contribute to a global renewable energy supply. Electrochemical reduction of CO 2 offers a viable pathway to generating value-added products and synthetic fuels to meet our future energy demands while decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. By constructing electrocatalysts capable of modulating proton transfer, we are able to tune product selectivity. Previous studies have demonstrated that two-electron products (CO and HCOOH) can be produced with high selectivity, but multiple-electron transfer products (CH 4 , CH 3 OH, and C2+ products) typically are produced at much lower Faradaic efficiencies. In this work, we construct polymer-modified Cu electrodes that exhibit extraordinarily high CH 4 production (88% Faradaic efficiency). These electrodes afford a new strategy for increasing the selectivity of CO 2 reduction electrocatalysts, an attribute that is key in developing industrially-relevant CO 2 conversion devices. Nafion is a widely used fluoropolymer that is often mixed with electrocatalysts to facilitate proton transport. In contrast to these Nafion-catalyst composites, this work studies electrodes covered by Nafion overlayers for the CO 2 reduction reaction. By varying the thickness, substrates, and voltage, we perform a detailed study of the effect of Nafion overlayers on metal and carbon mesh electrodes for CO 2 reduction. Depending on the thickness of the Nafion membrane, CO 2 reduction occurs at either the polymer&#8211;electrolyte interface or electrode&#8211;polymer interface. A Nafion overlayer of 15 &#956;m on a Cu electrode enables an extraordinarily high yield of CH 4 production (88% Faradaic efficiency) at a low overpotential (540 mV) via the stabilization of metal-bound CO intermediates. To the best of our knowledge, this yield is the highest for electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction to CH 4 production at room temperature reported.</description>

                Abstract Background In-hospital promotion of the oral route and IV to oral switch (IVOST)1 are key antimicrobial stewardship (AS) initiatives providing benefits for patients, staff and the environment, including reduced risk of line infections, medicine costs, nursing workload and plastic waste.1,2 A recent quality improvement (QI) initiative highlighting the environmental sustainability benefits of switching to oral metronidazole (bioavailability &amp;gt;90%) in surgical wards at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH) resulted in a 45% median reduction in IV administrations.3 Objectives To scale and spread this QI initiative to all inpatient wards in NHSGGC Clyde hospitals (RAH, Inverclyde Royal and Vale of Leven) and measure the impact on AS, drug costs, nursing workload and environmental sustainability. Methods A QI scale and spread approach was used including: targeted pharmacist/pharmacy technician prospective audit and feedback; presentations to medical, nursing and pharmacy teams; eye-catching posters on wards/electronic guideline platform; staff champions; and HEPMA IVOST prompts when prescribing or administering IV metronidazole.4 Oral and IV metronidazole usage data was calculated at baseline and for 36 months post-change. Benefits in terms of reduced IV administrations, drug costs and nursing time saved5 were calculated. Plastic waste reduction (giving sets, single use plastic containers, cannula, safety needles, gloves and aprons) associated with switching from IV to oral metronidazole was calculated in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions using a hybrid carbon footprinting methodology and emissions factor databases.6,7 Results There was a 64% median reduction in IV metronidazole defined daily doses (DDDs) (Figure 1) equating to 1977 and 23 724 fewer IV metronidazole administrations monthly and annually, respectively. The equivalent nursing time saved was 659 h per month and 7908 h per year. There was a 26% median shift in percentage IV metronidazole of total (IV plus oral) use (Figure 2). There was a 38% median reduction in metronidazole drug cost (Figure 3). The carbon footprint saving achieved from switching from IV to oral metronidazole was calculated as 1.48111 kg CO2e per dose, equating to 2928 kg CO2e per month and an annual carbon footprint saving of 35.1 tonnes CO2e; refer to Table 1 for equivalents. Conclusions A QI scale and spread approach to raise awareness of the multidisciplinary team to the benefits of appropriate switch from IV to oral metronidazole resulted in a change in prescribing behaviour and a significant reduction in IV administrations. This is important in terms of improved AS, patient safety, workforce cost and efficiency and environmental sustainability.</description>

                Titanium alloys are crucial in precision manufacturing due to their exceptional properties, but traditional machining methods lead to tool wear, deformation, and high costs. Conventional cooling fluids reduce heat but cause environmental issues, necessitating more sustainable solutions. Cryogenic Minimum Quantity Lubrication (CMQL) technology, using liquid nitrogen or carbon dioxide with minimal amounts of cutting fluid, offers an eco-friendly alternative that reduces machining temperatures and friction. This study tested the TC6 titanium alloy under conventional and CMQL conditions, focusing on tool wear, surface quality, and machining efficiency. Results showed that CMQL significantly decreased tool wear and surface roughness, with a 42% reduction in surface roughness during drilling and a 20&#8211;30% efficiency increase. The findings highlight CMQL&#8217;s potential to improve machining quality and efficiency while promoting environmentally friendly practices in the industry.</description>

                Sulfuryl fluoride (SO 2 F 2 ) has been largely used as a postharvest fumigant replacing methyl bromide (widely recognized among ozone-depleting substances). Sulfuryl fluoride, however, is a potent greenhouse gas with a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of ~ 5000 for a 100-year time zone far higher than that of carbon dioxide and methane. Ongoing pilot work showed that SO 2 F 2 fumes vented from fumigation chambers can be captured and hydrolyzed by hydroxide (OH - ) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) solution at pH ~12 in a scrubber with a complete conversion into SO 4 2- and F - as waste salts. The purchase, shipment, storage, and handling of concentrated stocks of H 2 O 2 and NaOH for use in SO 2 F 2 hydrolysis involve cost and safety concerns. Herein, we present an on-site, facile, and cost-effective pathway for the electrochemical production of OH - and H 2 O 2 in large enough concentrations to fully degrade ~ 95% of SO 2 F 2 captured. In that, we employed a commercial carbon catalyst that produced 250 mM H 2 O 2 at pH 12.6 within 4 h with a Faradaic efficiency of 98.8% for O 2 reduction to H 2 O 2 . We also propose a facile approach via surface oxidation of abundant carbon materials to significantly enhance both activity and selectivity for OH - and H 2 O 2 production under electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction. These findings provide new insights in the on-site production of industrial chemicals by means of clean, facile, and environmentally friendly electrochemical pathway. Moreover, the capability of recycling the hazardous SO 2 F 2 fumes and using the SO 4 2- and F - waste products as free sources of electrolyte can&#8217;t be overemphasized.</description>

                Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction serves as an effective strategy to tackle energy crises and mitigate greenhouse gas effects. The development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts has been a research hotspot in the field. In this study, we designed four Co-doped single-atom catalysts (Co&#8211;N&#967;@C) using carbon nanotubes as carriers, these catalysts included tri- and dicoordinated N-doped carbon nanoribbons, as well as tri- and dicoordinated N-doped graphene, respectively denoted as H3(H2)-Co/CNT and 3(2)-Co/CNT. The stable configurations of these Co&#8211;N&#967;@C catalysts were optimized using the PBE+D3 method. Additionally, we explored the reaction mechanisms of these catalysts for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into four C1 products, including CO, HCOOH, CH3OH and CH4, in detail. Upon comparing the limiting potentials (UL) across the Co&#8211;N&#967;@C catalysts, the activity sequence for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 was H2&#8211;Co/CNT &gt; 3-Co/CNT &gt; H3&#8211;Co/CNT &gt; 2-Co/CNT. Meanwhile, our investigation of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with four catalysts elucidated the influence of acidic conditions on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction process. Specifically, controlling the acidity of the solution was crucial when using the H3&#8211;Co/CNT and H2&#8211;Co/CNT catalysts, while the 3-Co/CNT and 2-Co/CNT catalysts were almost unaffected by the solution's acidity. We hope that our research will provide a theoretical foundation for designing more effective CO2 reduction electrocatalysts.</description>

                Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) electrolysis on copper (Cu) catalysts has attracted interest for its direct production of C 2+ feedstocks. Using the knowledge that CO 2 reduction on copper is primarily a tandem reaction of CO 2 to CO and CO to C 2+ products, we show that modulating CO concentrations within the liquid catalyst layer allows for C 2+ selectivity of &gt; 80 % at 200 mA cm -2 in a membrane electrode assembly over broad conversion conditions. The importance of CO pooling is demonstrated through residence time distribution curves, varying flow fields (serpentine/parallel/interdigitated), and flow rate. While serpentine flow fields require high conversions to limit CO selectivity and maximize C 2+ selectivity, the longer CO residence times of parallel flow fields reach similar selectivity over broad flow rates. Critically, we show that parts of the catalyst area are predominantly reducing CO instead of CO 2 as supported by CO reduction experiments and transport modelling of the reactor. In addition, higher cation crossover from the anolyte is shown to maximize C 2 + selectivity providing further evidence of cation effect on C-C coupling rates.</description>

                The rising levels of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere is among the most alarming issues in today&#8217;s world: harming the environment, health, and economics of all nations on the planet. CO 2 capture and its photochemical and/or photoelectrochemical reduction to fuels are promising methodologies to reduce atmospheric CO 2 . This is a photochemistry, electrochemistry, and catalysis problem. Transition metal complexes that can be tailored to a desired function utilizing a wide range of ligands, play a crucial role in solar fuels chemistry by reducing the activation energy for catalytic CO 2 reduction to fuels. In the last decade, Mn-based complexes have sparked a significant interest owing to their abundance in Earth&#8217;s crust and lower prices compared to other transition metals. However, a catalyst that operates with high activity and turnover numbers at low overpotential is still required. We report the synthesis, characterization, and activity toward CO 2 electrochemical reduction of Mn complexes containing the photoactive, electron-donating 1-imidazole-2,4,6-tri(carbazole-9-yl)-3,5-dicyanobenzene ligand (3CzImIPN). UV-vis and photoluminescence spectra of the Mn complex containing 3CzImIPN will be reported that investigate its photophysical properties under visible light. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) studies under nitrogen and CO 2 will be reported that investigate the electron transfer between the ligand and the Mn centre, as well as the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 . Evidence will be presented for a new, low overpotential pathway for the electroreduction of CO 2 by these types of complexes. Figure 1</description>

                The future of our planet critically depends on the introduction of new or improved strategies for developing non-polluting energy production. Leading approaches are the electrocatalytic production of hydrogen gas, development of fuel cells relying on efficient reduction of oxygen and either gaseous or liquid fuels, as well as efficient reduction of carbon dioxide. Metal complexes chelated by N4 macrocycles serve as excellent catalysts in many of these processes, performed at both homogeneous and heterogeneous conditions. Our contributions to those aspect focused on introducing metallocorroles as catalysts for reduction of protons, oxygen and carbon dioxide, as well as for water oxidation [1-5]. The common motif in these and other publications was to take advantage of the relatively easy functionalization of the macrocyclic periphery for the tuning of properties and reactivity. A significant game changer was the recently reported synthetic access to corroles with meso -CF 3 substituents and even to the parent corrole with no substituents whatsoever [6]. These developments allow for a focus on the size effect, which according to both hypothesis and fast accumulating results has a very strong effect (&#8220;smaller is better&#8221;) on the performance of electrodes modified by the corresponding metal complexes [7-9].

                Reduction of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is a worldwide problem that needs to be solved urgently. Storing CO2 as CO2 hydrate in subsurface reservoirs in cold regions can be an effective way to reduce atmospheric CO2 content. In this study, we utilize the geological data for three cold regions in Northeast and Northwest China to analyze the probable thickness, area, and porosity of the CO2 hydrate stability zone. Out of 12 cold locations, eight are located in the Qinghai&#8211;Tibetan Plateau (QTP), three in Northwest China (NW), and one in Mohe Basin (MB). Using conservative estimates of the effective thickness, area, and porosity, we calculate the reservoir volume of the CO2 hydrate stability zones for each location. The results show that the 12 cold locations have a total CO2 storage capacity of 2052 Gt. Of this, QTP has the highest CO2 storage capacity of 518 Gt.</description>

                Rutile-type Co0.5Ti0.5NbO4 (CTO)-based materials doped with Fe3+ or Ni2+ were investigated as cathode electrodes to modify their electrical conductivity and electrocatalysis toward CO2 splitting. Higher electric conductivity was found in Co0.4Fe0.2Ti0.4NbO4 (CTO-Fe, 0.78 S cm&#8211;1) and Co0.25Ni0.25Ti0.5NbO4 (CTO-Ni, 2.10 S cm&#8211;1) compared to CTO (0.49 S cm&#8211;1) after the reduction at 800 &#176;C in Ar-5% H2. Co and Co&#8211;Ni particles exsolved in situ from the surface of CTO, CTO-Fe, and CTO-Ni after reduction. CTO-Ni and CTO-Fe cathodes did better in the CO2 electrolysis at 800 &#176;C than the CTO one, but the CTO-Ni cell was unstable after 10 h of operation due to the carbon deposition that blocked the electrode. The cell with CTO-Fe demonstrated a good stability for CO2 splitting in 100 h. This work demonstrates that rutile-type CTO-based cathodes are promising to provide an efficient and candidate oxide cathode for the electrolysis of CO2.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of the Tribology of Diamond-Like Carbon Films in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Fracturing Fluid Environments</title>

                Surface wear of fracturing pump plungers seriously diminishes the efficiency of oil and gas production, while diamond-like carbon (DLC) film is considered to be a promising material for reducing friction and wear of oil and gas equipment due to its excellent comprehensive properties. However, the lubricating performance of DLC films is influenced by various factors, and the impact of CO2 content on their microscopic tribological behavior and mechanism under CO2 fracturing environment remains unexplored. This study employs reactive molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the tribological properties of two distinct systems under different CO2 contents in fracturing fluid environments. The results indicate that the reduction of average friction force primarily relies on the increase of CO2 content, and the increase in CO2 content enhances the mobility of medium molecules while also retarding the transformation of atomic lattice and the consumption of medium molecules. Although DLC film is encapsulated by atomic transfer layers at the later stages of sliding, atomic passivation still contributes to the reduction of friction force. Nevertheless, the application of DLC film directly and effectively diminishes the transformation of atomic lattice and shear strain, thereby reducing wear and deformation of the friction pairs. Concurrently, it significantly lowers the average temperature of the system. The findings suggest that enhancing CO2 content on the basis of applying DLC films significantly contributes to extending the service life of plungers.</description>

                Abstract The increase of global carbon dioxide concentration leads to climate change and accurate estimation of carbon sink fluxes from rock weathering in karst regions is of great significance to the current global carbon cycle and climate change. However, sulfide oxidation in coal-bearing strata in karst areas of northern China forms sulfuric acid that enters the karst groundwater system and participates in the dissolution of carbonate rocks, making carbon sink estimates potentially too high. To accurately estimate carbon sinks, we selected a typical foothill karst system in northern China. The effects of sulfuric acid on carbonate weathering and carbon sink flux were quantitatively evaluated by applying the Galy model and water chemistry methods. Twenty-nine data sets were analyzed for the dry and wet seasons. The results show that the karst groundwater ions in the spring area mainly originated from the weathering and dissolution of carbonate rocks and partly from the weathering and dissolution of silicate rocks. The total HCO3- flux in the spring area is 296.49&#180;103mol/km2&#183;a-1. When only carbonic acid dissolution was considered, the rock dissolution rate was 300.83&#180;103mol/km2&#183;a-1 and the total consumed CO2 flux was 191.82&#180;103mol/km2&#183;a-1. When carbonic acid and sulfuric acid were jointly involved, the rock dissolution rate was 364.33&#180;103mol/km2&#183;a-1 and the total consumed CO2 flux was 162.17&#180;103mol/km2&#183;a-1. With the participation of sulfuric acid, the rock dissolution rate was elevated by 21.11%, while the consumed CO2 flux decreased by 15%, and the sink reduction effect of sulfuric acid dissolution on karst carbon sinks was obvious. And the carbon sink rate in wet season more than doubled compared with that in dry season. This study provides a basis for the evaluation of carbon sinks in northern China.</description>

                Due to the intermediate operating temperatures (400-600 o C), protonic ceramic electrochemical cells have attracted significant attention in the last 10 years because of the demonstration of potential applications of fuel-flexible fuel cells, water electrolysis to produce hydrogen, solid-state ammonia synthesis, electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to fuels, and fuel processing (e.g., natural gas to liquids). In addition to developing specific fuel electrodes for different electrocatalytic reactions, we need to discover new electrolyte and oxygen electrode materials generically for all the protonic ceramic electrochemical cells to further decrease the operating temperatures, increase performance, and prolong the long-term stability. The recently emerging materials of high entropy perovskite oxides have been reported to be able to serve as promising electrolyte and oxygen electrode materials. In this talk, we will summarize what Clemson University has done about developing, characterizing, understanding, and demonstrating high entropy perovskite oxides as high-performance and stable electrolyte and oxygen electrode materials for protonic ceramic electrochemical cells.</description>

                In this comprehensive research endeavor, we introduce two groundbreaking methodologies poised to reshape the landscape of nanocomposite material synthesis, unlocking unprecedented potential across a spectrum of electrochemical applications. The Joule heating method, also known as Carbothermal Shock (CTS), emerges as a remarkably simple yet highly effective technique for generating multi-metallic nanoparticles (NPs), including high-entropy alloys (HEA). The CTS process involves loading a metal precursor onto a carbon substrate and swiftly elevating the temperature through the passage of an electric current, inducing rapid thermal shock and resulting in the formation of small and uniform NPs. While the CTS method has showcased high performance in various applications, such as rechargeable energy storage systems and catalytic conversion, challenges persist in achieving optimal surface coverage of NPs, particularly for electrochemical applications. For example, metal NPs formed through the CTS method have not been used for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) or nitrogen (N 2 ) reduction reactions because the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and unwanted reactions occur on the exposed carbon substrate as a competing reaction To overcome this challenge, we present a pioneering approach involving the utilization of partially carbonized cellulose as a novel carbon substrate. The cellulose matrix, distinguished by its unique structural characteristics, including interconnected aromatic rings and numerous edge sites, facilitates an unprecedented high surface coverage of various single and copper (Cu)-based polyelemental alloy NPs. The controlled manipulation of defect sites, such as vacancies and dangling bonds, within the carbonized cellulose plays a pivotal role in the nucleation and stabilization of metal NPs during the CTS process. The study underscores the correlation between defect sites on the carbon substrate and the resulting surface morphology of metal NPs, providing valuable insights for future advancements in nanocomposite material synthesis through the CTS method. Moreover, the cellulose-enabled high surface coverage Cu NPs exhibit remarkable potential in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction reactions. The Cu NPs on cellulose/carbon paper (Cu/cellulose/CP) demonstrated a high ethylene selectivity of 48.92% at a potential of &#8722;0.529 V versus the reverse hydrogen electrode (RHE), maintaining stability over 30 hours of reaction in a 10 M KOH electrolyte. This study presents an exciting prospect for expanding the applications of polyelemental alloy NPs synthesized via the CTS method in diverse electrochemical applications. Transitioning to the second part of the research, we explore the application of MXenes, a recently discovered family of two-dimensional materials composed of transition metal carbides and carbonitrides. These atomically thin layers exhibit a unique combination of metallic conductivity and high surface area due to their layered structure. To enhance the properties of MXenes and broaden their applications, various components, including organic small molecules, polymers, metals, and semiconducting materials, have been incorporated into their intrinsic nanostructures. However, existing methods for fabricating MXene composite hybrid materials predominantly rely on solution processing techniques, introducing challenges such as severe MXene oxidation and nanoparticle aggregation. Addressing these limitations, we introduce a revolutionary rapid Joule heating approach, a solution-free method designed to synthesize a diverse range of MXene hybrid nanocomposites. This approach minimizes MXene oxidation on the surface and ensures a uniform distribution of nanoparticles on MXene surfaces without the drawbacks of severe aggregations. It became possible to synthesize metal NPs from unary to senary combinations (including Pt, Co, Ni, Fe, Cu components) with minimal MXene oxidation through rapid heating. The ability to easily modify the precursor ratio and synthesize unlimited combinations of MXene composite hybrid nanostructures enables the modulation of material properties to achieve high performance in diverse electrochemical applications. The resulting Pt-MXene hybrid nanostructure, synthesized through this novel approach, exhibits promising electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by minimizing MXene oxidation during the synthesis process. This breakthrough method holds immense potential for a wide range of catalytic applications, where the synergistic effects of MXene composites can significantly contribute.</description>

                On the way to carbon neutrality, directly catalyzing atmospheric CO2 into high&#8208;value chemicals might be an effective approach to mitigate the negative impacts of rising airborne CO2 concentrations. Here, we pioneer the investigation of the influence of the H2/CO2 partial pressure ratio (PPR) on air&#8208;level CO2 methanation. Using Ni/CeO2 as a case catalyst, increasing H2/CO2 PPR significantly improves low&#8208;temperature CO2 conversion and high&#8208;temperature CH4 selectivity, i.e., from 10 of H2/CO2 PPR on, CO2 is completely methanized at 250 &#176;C, and nearly 100% CH4 selectivity is achieved at 400 &#176;C. 100&#8208;hour stability tests demonstrate the practical application potential of Ni/CeO2 at 250 &#176;C and 400 &#176;C. In&#8208;situ DRIFTS reveal that reinforced formate pathway by increasing H2/CO2 PPR is responsible for the high CH4 yield. In contrast, even though the CO pathway dominated CO2 conversion on Ni is enhanced by rising H2/CO2 PPR, but at a high reaction temperature, the promoted CO desorption still leads to lower CH4 selectivity. This work offers deep insights into the direct air&#8208;level CO2 resourceization, contributing to the achievement of airborne CO2 reductions.</description>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) is a meaningful way for CO2 depletion and value addition. And electrocatalysts play great roles in the CO2 reduction product selectivity. SnOx-based catalysts have been widely used in formate production. However, the activity and selectivity are still unsatisfying, especially at the industrial level current density (&gt;0.2 A cm&#8211;2) for pure HCOOH production. In this work, we proposed a triple-metal composite electrocatalyst with high oxygen vacancy contents and an abundant grain-boundary strategy for the eCO2RR. In particular, oxygen vacancies in the designed catalyst reached 13.9%. When catalysts were employed as catalysts for eCO2RR, both high HCOOH FE and long-term electrolysis stability under acid electrolytes were obtained.

                Direct solar-driven conversion of carbon dioxide to chemicals and fuels requires identification of efficient, durable, and selective photocathodes. Chalcogenide p-type semiconductors, exemplified by chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 (CIGS), have been effectively deployed as photocathodes. However, selectivity toward CO 2 reduction and durability of the commonly used CdS buffer layer remain unsolved challenges. We have demonstrated that for the wide band gap CuGa 3 Se 5 chalcopyrite absorber these challenges are well addressed by an organic coating generated in situ from an N,N&#8242;-(1,4-phenylene)bispyridinium ditriflate salt in the electrolyte. The molecular additive provides a 30-fold increase in selectivity toward CO2R productscompared to the unmodified system and lowers Cd corrosion at least 10-fold. This dual functionality highlights the promise of hybrid solid-state-molecular photocathodes for enabling durable and efficient solar fuel systems.This presentation will highlight the variations in product selectivity and durability observed for different combinations of coatings derived from molecular precursors in the electrolyte with photocathodes includingCuGa 3 Se 5 and Cu(In,Ga)Se 2 , with and without CdS buffer layers.</description>

                Abstract Atomic Fe sites enabled electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction (ECO 2 R) to carbon monoxide (CO) at low overpotentials. However, the narrow potential ranges for selective CO 2 conversion on atomic Fe sites hindered the CO production at high current densities. Therefore, unveiling the CO 2 electroreduction processes and clarifying the catalytic mechanisms on different atomic Fe sites are important for better design of atomic Fe catalysts toward efficient ECO 2 R. Herein, the ECO 2 R processes on single&#8208;atom, dual&#8208;atom, and cluster Fe sites are systematically investigated, and clarify that the balanced water dissociation and CO 2 protonation on dual&#8208;atom Fe sites promote the efficient CO production. The dual&#8208;atom Fe catalyst achieves Faradaic efficiencies of CO ( FE CO ) above 92% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.4&#8211;&#8722;0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and maintains FE CO of 91% after 153&#8208;h electrolysis in H&#8208;type cell. Benefitting from the favorable CO 2 protonation for ECO 2 R on dual&#8208;atom Fe sites, pH&#8208;universal CO 2 electroreduction is achieved in alkali&#8208;/acid&#8208;/bicarbonate&#8208;fed membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, with FE CO exceeds 98% in strongly acidic/alkaline and neutral mediums. The work reveals a water dissociation&#8208;promoted CO 2 electroreduction on dual&#8208;atom Fe sites and presents a feasible regulation of atomic Fe sites for highly active/selective ECO 2 R.</description>

                Copper-silver (Cu-Ag) bimetallics and alloys are attractive due to their enhanced performance compared to their parent metals in various fields including electronics, batteries, biomedicine, solar technology, energy storage, and catalysis.[1] Existing methods for synthesizing Cu-Ag bimetallics suffer from major drawbacks such as intense temperature and pressure conditions, pre and post-treatment processes, and multiple time-consuming steps.[2, 3] In this work, Cu-Ag bimetallic films were synthesized under various ratios for the first time using a newly developed Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jet (APPJ) system. Synthesis was done in a single step, in under 15 minutes. The samples exhibited strong adhesion onto various substrates such as glass and glassy carbon. This direct-deposition technique requires low power input (&lt;50 W) without the need for any pre- or post-treatment processes and with little to no waste. This contrasts with wet chemistry, where deposition normally takes 12-24 hours followed by thermal processes that produce several waste products.[4] Considering the high melting points (MP) of pure Cu and Ag (MP of Cu is ca. 1,085 &#176;C and MP of Ag is ca. 962 &#176;C), and the fact that they are immiscible, the formation of Cu-Ag alloys usually requires a high amount of energy under intense conditions.[5] These Cu-Ag films were characterized via cyclic voltammetry (CV), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Here, we demonstrate that by only mixing low-concentration metal salt solutions and using a neutral gas (helium), we can readily synthesize metal alloys while controlling their thickness, shape, composition, and metal ratios. From an electrochemical point of view, APPJ drives the reduction of metal cations from the presence of free electrons. This suggests the presence of a medium that is considered either as an electrode, due to the presence of electrons, or as an electrolyte, due to their electrical conduction.[6] These plasma-synthesized materials were tested as electrocatalysts for reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) under various potentials. The performance of these catalysts was assessed via electrochemical surface area (ECSA), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and pulse voltammetry techniques. Copper is the only heterogeneous catalyst that converts CO 2 into valuable chemicals, such as hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and alcohols.[7] Interestingly, we illustrate that the addition of silver improves the catalytic activity of copper toward CO 2 reduction under low potentials. This is a desirable property given the anticipated transition to green energy.

      <title>Chemical-Assisted CO2 Water-Alternating-Gas Injection for Enhanced Sweep Efficiency in CO2-EOR</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29163978</link>

                CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) is a crucial method for CO2 utilization and sequestration, representing an important zero-carbon or even negative-carbon emission reduction technology. However, the low viscosity of CO2 and reservoir heterogeneity often result in early gas breakthrough, significantly reducing CO2 utilization and sequestration efficiency. A water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection is a technique for mitigating gas breakthrough and viscous fingering in CO2-EOR. However, it encounters challenges related to insufficient mobility control in highly heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs, resulting in gas channeling and low sweep efficiency. Despite the extensive application and research of a WAG injection in oil and gas reservoirs, the most recent comprehensive review dates back to 2018, which focuses on the mechanisms of EOR using conventional WAG. Herein, we give an updated and comprehensive review to incorporate the latest advancements in CO2-WAG flooding techniques for enhanced sweep efficiency, which includes the theory, applications, fluid displacement mechanisms, and control strategies of a CO2-WAG injection. It addresses common challenges, operational issues, and remedial measures in WAG projects by covering studies from experiments, simulations, and pore-scale modeling. This review aims to provide guidance and serve as a reference for the application and research advancement of CO2-EOR techniques in heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs.</description>

      <title>The Freshwater Cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 Does Not Require an Active External Carbonic Anhydrase</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/plants13162323</link>

                Under standard laboratory conditions, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 lacks EcaASyn, a periplasmic carbonic anhydrase (CA). In this study, a S. elongatus transformant was created that expressed the homologous EcaACya from Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142. This additional external CA had no discernible effect on the adaptive responses and physiology of cells exposed to changes similar to those found in S. elongatus natural habitats, such as fluctuating CO2 and HCO3&#8722; concentrations and ratios, oxidative or light stress, and high CO2. The transformant had a disadvantage over wild-type cells under certain conditions (Na+ depletion, a reduction in CO2). S. elongatus cells lacked their own EcaASyn in all experimental conditions. The results suggest the presence in S. elongatus of mechanisms that limit the appearance of EcaASyn in the periplasm. For the first time, we offer data on the expression pattern of CCM-associated genes during S. elongatus adaptation to CO2 replacement with HCO3&#8722;, as well as cell transfer to high CO2 levels (up to 100%). An increase in CO2 concentration coincides with the suppression of the NDH-14 system, which was previously thought to function constitutively.</description>

                Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (eCO 2 R) has emerged as a promising approach to produce high-value fuels and chemicals using renewable energy sources. In particular, Cu catalysts can convert CO 2 to a wide range of hydrocarbon and oxygenate products, including CO, formate, ethanol and ethylene. However, the activity and selectivity of eCO 2 R is highly dependent on mass transport and the corresponding reaction microenvironment present under operating conditions. In this talk, we present an integrated framework that combines experiments with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and density functional theory (DFT) based microkinetic modeling to predict the effect of varying mass transport on eCO 2 R in a custom-designed flow cell. The flow cell is designed with multiple electrolyte jets impinging onto the electrocatalyst surface for rapid and homogeneous reactant transport. We first demonstrate the effect of mass transport in a flow cell architecture by controlling the flow rate of CO 2 -saturated 0.1 M KHCO 3 to a Cu electrocatalyst. Significant increases in the production rates of formate and CO are observed with increasing flow rate, as well as an enhancement in multi-carbon products at high overpotentials. Increasing flow rate promotes hydrogen evolution at low overpotentials but has little effect at large overpotentials, suggesting a transition from HCO 3 - to water as the dominant proton donor with increasing overpotential. CFD simulations are employed to model the distribution of boundary layer thicknesses within the flow cell, which subsequently set the boundary conditions for the coupled 1D transport-microkinetic model. The calculated boundary layer thickness values are corroborated by experimentally measured transport-limited currents. Our model successfully predicts experimentally observed trends in selectivity with mass transport, such as an increase in the production of ethylene and ethanol at high flow rates due to enhanced CO 2 transport. The slight suppression of hydrogen reduction at higher flow rates due to an increase in *CO coverage is also predicted and supported by experimental results. This work demonstrates the importance of incorporating transport processes in the CFD-DFT coupled modeling of device performance for electrochemical CO 2 reduction.

                The activity and product selectivity of electrocatalysts for reactions like the carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide reduction reactions (CO2RR and CORR) are intimately dependent on the catalyst&#8217;s structure and composition. While engineering catalytic surfaces can improve performance, discovering the key sets of rational design principles remains challenging due to limitations in modeling catalyst stability under operating conditions. Herein, we perform first-principles density functional calculations adopting implicit solvation methods with potential control to study the influence of adsorbates and applied potential on the stability of different facets of model Cu electrocatalysts. Using coverage dependencies extracted from microkinetic models, we describe an approach for calculating potential and adsorbate-dependent contributions to surface energies under reaction conditions, where Wulff constructions are used to understand the morphological evolution of Cu electrocatalysts under CO2RR and CORR conditions. We identify that CO*, a key reaction intermediate, exhibits higher kinetically and thermodynamically accessible coverages on (100) relative to (111) facets, which can translate into an increased relative stabilization of the (100) facet during CO2RR. Our results support the known tendency for increased (111) faceting of Cu nanoparticles under more reducing conditions and that the relative increase in (100) faceting observed under CO2RR conditions is likely attributed to differences in CO* coverage between these facets.

                Abstract Catalytic reactions mainly depend on the adsorption properties of reactants on the catalyst, which provides a perspective for the design of reversible lithium&#8722;carbon dioxide (Li&#8722;CO 2 ) batteries including CO 2 reduction (CO 2 RR) and CO 2 evolution (CO 2 ER) reactions. However, due to the complex reaction process, the relationship between the adsorption configuration and CO 2 RR/CO 2 ER catalytic activity is still unclear in Li &#9472; CO 2 batteries. Herein, taking Co 3 S 4 as a model system, nickel (Ni substitution in the tetrahedral site to activate cobalt (Co) atom for forming multiatom catalytic domains in NiCo 2 S 4 is utilized. Benefiting from the special geometric and electronic structures, NiCo 2 S 4 exhibits an optimized adsorption configuration of lithium carbonate (Li 2 CO 3 ), promoting its effective activation and decomposition. As a result, the Li&#8722;CO 2 batteries with NiCo 2 S 4 cathode exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance in terms of low potential gap of 0.42 V and high energy efficiency of 88.7%. This work provides a unique perspective for the development of highly efficient catalysts in Li&#8722;CO 2 batteries.</description>

                In this study egg white was used as a source of natural amino acids to modify the surface properties of palm shell activated carbon towards enhancing its CO2 capture performance. A simple impregnation method was employed for this purpose. Characterisation analysis was performed on the egg white-impregnated activated carbon to examine any changes on its surface properties prior to CO2 adsorption test. The modified adsorbent showed high thermal stability below 300&#176;C and comprised of new amide functional group. Furthermore, the modified adsorbent exhibited 31% higher breakthrough time and maintained its CO2 adsorption capacity at 0.3 mmol/g in comparison to raw activated carbon, regardless of the reduction of surface area and micropore volume by 17% and 18% respectively. These findings provide evidence on the prospect of egg white-impregnated activated carbon for CO2 adsorption application which could pave the way for a new generation of affordable and eco-friendly adsorbents.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Gas Accessibility via Macropore Engineering in Amine-Loaded Silica Particles for Enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Adsorption Performance</title>

                The urgent need to mitigate climate change has spurred the development of efficient adsorbents for CO2 capture. Porous solid sorbents, especially those incorporating amine-modified porous silica materials, offer a promising alternative due to their superior selectivity and reversibility. However, the existing research has focused on developing mesoporous silica for CO2 adsorption applications, often overlooking the role of macropores. One critical challenge with mesoporous silica is the restriction in the loading amount of amine due to low pore volume, which is followed by reduction of the CO2 capture capacity due to pore blocking and a decrease in surface area at high amine concentration. Macroporous silica particles offer promising advantages over mesopores in CO2 adsorption performance, including improved mass transfer kinetics and enhanced accessibility of CO2 to amine sites. Therefore, the CO2 adsorption capacity of porous silica materials may not have reached its full potential, and the influence of macropore sizes ranging from 60 to 400 nm has yet to be fully explored. This research, for the first time, aims to address current limitations in CO2 capture methodologies by engineering controllable porous silica particles with various macropore sizes utilizing a spray process followed by tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) modification. Results indicate that increasing TEPA concentration up to 70 wt % enhanced the CO2 adsorption capacity of the particles. The absorption performance was maximized in macroporous silica with a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) template size of 291 nm (6.08 mmol CO2/g of absorbent). Generally, larger macropore size facilitates CO2 diffusion within the particles, preventing the formation of inactive TEPA sites and reducing the CO2 diffusion resistance. This study not only highlights the relationship between the macroporous structure, TEPA modification, and CO2 adsorption capacity but also provides valuable insights for advancing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, emphasizing the potential of macroporous silica to overcome the inherent limitations of its mesoporous counterpart.</description>

      <title>Selection and Optimization of China&#8217;s Energy Transformation Pathway Under Carbon-Neutral Targets</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12081758</link>
      <description>Yingying Qi, Guohua Yu, Processes. 12(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401761761

                This paper uses a bottom-up national energy technology model to study the optimization of China&#8217;s energy transformation pathway. The model clarifies specific action plans for China&#8217;s energy transformation pathway from 2020 to 2060, total carbon emissions, industry emission reduction responsibilities, and other dimensions. The results show that: (1) The proportion of renewable energy consumption in China&#8217;s entire energy system from 2020 to 2060 will gradually exceed that of fossil energy under ideal circumstances, and the energy system will transition from traditional fossil energy to renewable energy. Meanwhile, the proportion of low-carbon energy sources, such as renewable energy, in primary energy demand will jump from 15.9% in 2020 to over 80% by 2060. (2) China&#8217;s CO2 emissions will be approximately 3 billion tons, 2 billion tons, and 1 billion tons under three different socio-economic development scenarios of low, medium, and high speed in 2060. At that time, China will still need to absorb CO2 through carbon sinks in forests, oceans, and wetlands. (3) The electricity industry has the highest CO2 emissions compared to other industries. The electricity industry must bear significant responsibility for carbon reduction in future energy transformation and economic development.</description>

                Abstract Recovery of natural gas liquid (NGL) from flared gas is considered one of the techniques of emissions reduction, the recovered quantity depends on several factors including the natural gas composition, operating pressure, and temperature. Process simulation is required to measure the recovery of NGL from the flared gas, and process simulation cases are required to predict the NGL productivity, these cases should be generated at several operating conditions for optimization purposes. In this paper, 12873 data sets are generated using Aspen HYSYS for different natural gas compositions collected from 11 natural gas fields. These huge data sets are used to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting the NGL recovery. The developed model was trained based on 70% of the data sets, validated based on 15%, and tested using 15 % of all the data sets. The results show that the developed NN model can accurately the NGL recovery based on the natural gas composition, and the operating pressure and temperature with a coefficient of determination of 0.9999 and an absolute average error of 4%. The proposed model for estimating NGL production rates is a feasible environmental issue. The availability of changing the operating pressure and temperature could help in selecting the proper equipment such as recovery compressors and refrigeration unit size. This approach also could allow production companies to join the project quickly, eliminate carbon dioxide emissions, and start to gain money in a short time.</description>

                Crop production is inherently sensitive to variability in climate. Temperature and CO2 are two important parameters related to climate change, affecting crop yield in a particular region. In this study, an attempt has been made to assess the impact of these two parameters on the productivity of maize crop taking sub tropical region of Jammu as study area. A CERES-Maize model 4.0 was used for this purpose. Three-year weather data (2004-06) is used to simulate the actual yield under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Yield was simulated with elevated temperature (1, 3 and 5oC) and CO2 (440, 550 and 660 ppm) during the growing season. As changes in CO2 concentration and temperature likely to occur concomitantly, so growth and development of maize plant at three temperature regimes (1, 3 and 5oC) under double (660 ppm) CO2 concentration to the baseline (330 ppm) was also assessed. The difference in yield, biomass, grain number and LAI was estimated and analyzed to assess the effect of elevated temperature and CO2. Results revealed that the rise in temperature accelerated plant phenology, reducing dry matter accumulation and crop yield by 5 to 60 per cent. Elevation of CO2 in the level of 440, 550 and 660 ppm showed gradual yield increment of 2.01, 3.92 and 5.37 per cent under rainfed conditions and 2.33, 4.52 and 7.41 per cent under irrigated conditions, respectively. Doubled CO2 increased yield at all the temperature rise situation and completely mitigated the yield and biomass reduction due to temperature rise up to 1oC.</description>

      <title>Optimal Design of a Binder-Free Manganese/Cobalt Bilayer Bifunctional Catalyst for Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/1945-7111/ad7294</link>

                Abstract We have developed a bilayer film comprising cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) underlayer and manganese dioxide (MnO2) upper layer, which are active toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), respectively. The bilayer bifunctional catalyst is synthesized by electrodepositing cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)2) on a porous carbon paper (CP) and subsequently immersing the obtained Co(OH)2/CP in a potassium permanganate (KMnO4) solution without binders or conductive additives. Specifically, electron transfer between the already-deposited Co(OH)2 and MnO4&#8211; proceeded in the solution, yielding MnO2, until all the Co ions become trivalent, after which self-terminates. The proposed method only allows for the construction of the minimum required bifunctional catalyst only at the reaction site of the gas-diffusion electrode, i.e., at the so-called three-phase interface, thus remarkably increasing catalyst utilization while improving reactant and product diffusions. The developed catalyst shows stable MnO2/CoOOH cycles at |20| mA cm&#8211;2 with a minimal difference (0.764 V) between the OER and ORR potentials, reflecting the structural advantage of the proposed catalyst. This work proposes efficient bifunctional catalysts having spatially separated OER/ORR reactive sites that can be synthesized via the simple and scalable electrochemical method, which does not require the skill and optimization of binder and electron-conducting additives.</description>

      <title>Minimize Energy Consumption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Release in a Flow Electrolyzer By Optimizing Direct Air Capture Solvents</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-01271447mtgabs</link>
      <description>Xin Gao, Ayokunle Omosebi, Aron Patrick, Kunlei Liu, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-01(27)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401697583

                Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, almost 200 nations have committed to the global goal of limiting the rise in average temperatures to 2.0 &#176;C above preindustrial levels, with an even more ambitious aim of striving for 1.5 &#176;C. Achieving the 1.5 &#176;C objective requires a 45% reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, ultimately reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Numerous industries are increasingly making commitments to combat climate change by minimizing their CO2 emissions. However, certain sectors face challenges due to the current high costs associated with emissions reduction through available technologies, though these costs are expected to decrease over time. Moreover, in specific industries like cement production, there are emissions sources that cannot be entirely eliminated, such as those arising from the inherent calcination process. Given these constraints, realizing the emissions reduction pathway to the 1.5 &#176;C target requires the adoption of negative emissions processes, including technologies like direct air capture (DAC), to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere. The operational concept of the DAC process explored in this study is based on the utilization of both the solvent-based method and alkaline water electrolysis. This involves regenerating the solvent through pH fluctuations generated by a carbonate electrolyzer. As depicted in Figure 1, the consumption of OH- ions during O2 evolution leads to a decrease in pH at the anolyte loop, while the production of OH- ions through water splitting causes an increase in pH at the catholyte loop. Consequently, the lowered pH environment facilitates the release of CO2 gas from dissolved carbon species such as CO32-, while the heightened pH environment promotes the formation of alkaline hydroxides for carbon capture in an air absorber. In this work, we will aim to analyze the energy consumption per mole of CO2 released from the anolyte loop of a flow electrolyzer. Utilizing a combination of theoretical predictions and experimental validations, significant insights were obtained for optimizing the DAC solvent. This optimization involves minimizing energy consumption by adjusting alkalinity levels and incorporating supporting electrolytes. Figure 1</description>

      <title>Effect of Pressure on the Gas Diffusion Electrodes during CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction Reaction</title>

                Electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 is a promising process to produce renewable chemical feedstocks, such as CO, formic acid, ethylene, and ethanol. To overcome mass transfer limitations imposed by the low solubility of CO2 in the liquid phase, gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) are used to ensure an adequate supply of CO2. The gas&#8211;liquid interface within the GDEs is crucial for achieving high selectivity and stability of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but it is prone to flooding, which can terminate the reactions. Here, we built electrochemical models of silver-based and copper-based GDEs for studying intrinsic factors related to flooding. Our results reveal that there is a narrow "pressure window" for CO2RR, which has a negative correlation with current density. We further define three regions based on the "pressure window": the bubbling zone, the normal working condition zone, and the permeable zone. Our research shows that the bubbling zone offers better selectivity for gaseous products, while the permeable zone favors the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, electrochemical characterization testing investigated the characteristics of each zone and its impact on CO2RR.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Conversion of Bicarbonate Using Proton Exchange Membrane-Based Electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-01372169mtgabs</link>
      <description>Hui&#8208;Yun Jeong, Christopher Hahn, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-01(37)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401695850

                Direct electrochemical conversion of captured carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is gaining interest as an efficient method for capturing and utilizing CO 2 , eliminating the need for energy-intensive CO 2 separation process. [1] The integrated electrolyzer with bicarbonate feed operates on the principle of spontaneous reduction of CO 2 released from bicarbonate within the electrolyzer. The key to the on-site decomposition of bicarbonate into CO 2 is to acidify the bicarbonate within the electrolyzer through the deliberately generated pH gradient. Bipolar membrane has been extensively used to generate pH gradient and acidify the bicarbonate feed. [2] However, the high ionic resistivity of bipolar membrane and slow kinetic of water dissociation reaction can result in a high operation cell voltage. In this study, we demonstrate proton exchange membrane based-bicarbonate electrolyzer which produces carbon monoxide from bicarbonate feedstock with high CO production selectivity and low cell voltage that are comparable to the conventional gas fed CO 2 electrolyzer. To achieve highly selective CO production selectivity, a nickel single atom catalyst (Ni SAC) where the atomically dispersed nickel active sites decorated on the nitrogen doped carbon was prepared and utilized. Ni-SAC showed high CO production selectivity even in bicarbonate feed electrolyzer. To further improve the performance of this integrated electrolyzer, significant attention was given to the optimization of electrode structures. Due to the complexity of the reaction environment within the integrated electrolzyer, the performance of the electrolyzer is heavily dependent on the porosity of electrodes and distribution of catalyst on the electrodes. By optimizing the fabrication of electrodes with Ni-SACs, the optimal catalyst coated electrode showed high CO production selectivity over 90% with current density of 100 mA/cm 2 at low operating cell potential of 3 V.

                Since the Industrial Revolution, nearly 700 GtC of carbon have been emitted into the atmosphere as CO2 derived from human activities, of which 292 GtC remain uncontrolled. Furthermore, the emission rate is increasing yearly, with the latest value (2022) of 11 GtC. By the end of this century, the atmospheric CO2 concentration is predicted to surpass 700 ppm. The effects of this sudden carbon release on the worldwide biogeochemical cycles and balances are not yet fully understood, but it is undeniable that global warming and climate change are already a fact, with this gas playing a starring role. Governmental policies and international agreements on emission reduction need to produce results quickly enough, and the deadline to act is running out. Besides the agreements to reduce emissions, alternative strategies to reverse this trend must be sufficiently promoted. Biological CO2 capture is a speedy flow of the carbon cycle capable of capturing over 115 GtC annually through photosynthesis. An increase of 6.5% in this capture and the subsequent stabilization of produced biomass could counteract the current CO2 emission rate. In this overview, the artificial culture of phytoplankton is considered a potential alternative to conducting this large-scale capture. A production system model is suggested and the main technological and political challenges for using large areas as partially-natural photobioreactors are discussed. The global implementation of these large CO2 sinks and the associated infrastructure would stabilize the carbon cycle while it is developed as a new source of richness.</description>

                The N&#8208;formylation of amines using CO2 hydrogenation, conducted under additive&#8208;free conditions, represents a crucial methodology in organic synthesis. Herein, we demonstrated a highly efficient ruthenium pincer complex for the selective conversion of a wide array of amines into their corresponding formamides under additive&#8208;free condition with a turnover number (TON) of 980,000 within a single&#8208;batch. Controlled studies suggested the initial reduction of CO2 to carbamate, followed by dehydration to generate formamide. NMR experiments revealed the potential intermediates and indicated the involvement of metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity of catalyst during substrate activation. In addition, this methodology was examined to establish a carbon neutral hydrogen storage cycle by capitalizing on the reversible transformation of formamides.</description>

                Advances in the theoretical understanding of electrochemical systems have, over the past decade, led to growing use of periodic Density Functional Theory studies to treat a surprisingly large ensemble of electrocatalytic reactions, ranging from carbon dioxide electroreduction to oxygen evolution. Many such studies have employed simplified models of the electrochemical environment to determine reactivity trends across a broad space of catalytic materials, while other efforts have focused on developing detailed descriptions of electrochemical phenomena, such as the structure of electrochemical double layers, on model catalyst structures. An emerging challenge is to combine these approaches to ultimately enable theoretical design of electrocatalysts for reactions of significantly expanded chemical and materials complexity. In this talk, I will begin by discussing how we have applied strategies from computational heterogeneous catalysis to design enhanced electrocatalysts for the classic oxygen reduction reaction. In such treatments, we have effected highly detailed analyses of the catalyst surface structure and have employed machine learning-based methods to describe interactions between the various ORR reaction intermediates that are present at significant surface coverages. I will then explore challenges in obtaining more detailed descriptions of the electrocatalytic reaction environment, including the structure of catalysts with solid/solid interfaces, the distribution of charges in electrochemical double layers, and the structure and entropy of solvents near the electrocatalyst surface. I will conclude with some perspectives on how these complexities may be incorporated into traditional computational catalyst screening approaches to identify improved materials for more complex electrocatalytic systems.</description>

                Carbon dioxide emission from fossil fuel combustion poses a major threat to global environment and ecological systems.Carbon capture, sequestration and conversion technologies are widely pursued as possible solutions to mitigate negative impact by CO 2 . The electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to fuels and chemicals using renewable electricity offers attractive &#8220;carbon-neutral&#8221; and &#8220;carbon-negative&#8221; mitigation strategies. Various catalysts have been investigated as the electrocatalysts for CO 2 RR. Key challenges facing the current catalyst and electrolyzer designs include insufficient energy efficiency and low single product selectivity. CO 2 RR to C 2 + chemicals represent a highly important area for CO 2 reduction and utilization. For example, ethanol, ethylene, propanol, etc. are among the most produced chemicals by the industry and are widely used for various applications. Using CO 2 as raw material for chemical production through electrocatalysis not only improves the carbon cycling, but also reduces the overall emissions from chemical production. While CO 2 RR via two proton-electron pairs (PEPs), such as the conversion of CO 2 to CO or formate, have been proven high selective with fast kinetics, conversions to C 2 + chemicals are significantly more difficult due to the rapid escalation of required PEPs to much higher numbers (for example, 12 for ethanol and 18 for propanol), in addition to C-C bond coupling. The increased PEPs substantially complicate the conversion by required multiple steps along the electrochemical coordinate, leading to a high probability of branching reactions and low single product Faradaic efficiency (FE). To address these challenges, the design criteria for CO2RR to C 2 + chemicals should be based on high uniformity of active center for directing identical catalytic path and suppressing competing reactions, strong catalyst-reactant binding in capturing the transient species through multiple PEP transfers, and microenvironment with nanoconfinement for retaining reaction intermediates during extended catalytic processes. Recently, we developed a new amalgamated lithium metal (ALM) synthesis method of preparing highly selective and active CO 2 RR catalyst and achieved &gt; 90% FE for conversion of CO 2 to ethanol [1]. Our have since expanded the approach to other C 2 + chemicals including acetate, acetone, glycerol, isopropanol, etc., all with FE at or higher than 80%. To better formulate our catalyst design strategy, we not only measured the CO 2 RR performance over a variety of electrocatalysts, but also investigated their activity-structure relationship through advanced material characterizations, combined with the first-principle computation. We found many interesting properties uniquely associated to CO 2 RR mechanism and kinetics, such as catalyst-size and electro-potential modulated single selectivity. In this presentation, we will share our recent discoveries and future perspective on the development of highly selective CO 2 RR catalysts for C 2 + chemical conversions.

                The electrochemical reduction of CO2 into value-added chemicals is pivotal for advancing toward carbon neutrality and sustainable energy sources. However, achieving high selectivity for specific products remains challenging due to numerous potential reaction pathways. In this work, we present an innovative copper-sulfur planar structure, Cu-S-BDC, within a metal-organic framework (MOF) catalyst, which demonstrates remarkable selectivity towards formate as the sole carbon product. Notably, it achieves a 59% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for formate at -0.4 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. The reaction mechanism uncovers that the Cu-S catalytic sites within the MOF stabilize the HCOO* intermediate, thereby facilitating selective formate production. Additionally, we elucidate the electronic properties of the MOF, revealing a narrow band gap of 1.203 eV, which enhances the charge transfer within the quasi-2D inorganic building unit structure of the MOF and consequently increases the electrochemical reaction current density. This study highlights the potential of engineering the metal coordination environment within MOFs to enhance both product selectivity and conductivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction.</description>

                Abstract. The rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) would decrease in response to decrease of anthropogenic emissions or cessation (net zero emissions) is of great scientific and societal interest. Such decrease in atmospheric CO2 on the centennial scale would be due essentially entirely to transfer of carbon into the world ocean (WO) and the terrestrial biosphere (TB), which are sink compartments on this time scale. The rate of decrease of excess atmospheric CO2 and the apportionment of this decrease into the two sink compartments has been examined in two prior model intercomparison studies, subsequent either to a pulse emission of CO2 or to abrupt cessation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The present study examines and quantifies inter-model anticorrelation in those studies in the net rate and extent of uptake of CO2 into the two sink compartments. Specifically, in each study the time-dependent coefficients characterizing the net transfer rate into the two sink compartments, (evaluated as the net transfer rate normalized to excess atmospheric CO2 above pre-pulse amount, for the pulse experiment; or as the net transfer rate divided by excess atmospheric CO2 above preindustrial amount, for the abrupt cessation experiment) was found to exhibit strong anticorrelation across the participating models. That is, models for which the normalized rate of uptake into the WO was high exhibited low uptake rate into the TB, and vice versa. This anticorrelation in net transfer rate results in anticorrelation in net uptake extent into the two compartments that is substantially greater than would be expected simply from competition for excess CO2 between the two sink compartments. This anticorrelation, which is manifested in diminished inter-model diversity, can lead to artificially enhanced confidence in current understanding of the consequences of potential future reductions of CO2 emissions and in the global warming potentials of non-CO2 greenhouse gases relative to that of CO2.</description>

                Co-electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and nitrate/nitrite as carbon and nitrogen sources to synthesize urea is an effective strategy to solve the energy problem and alleviate environmental pollution. In this work, combined density functional theory calculations with a constant-potential implicit solvent model, we proposed a strategy for the determination of the preferred reaction pathway and the potential window that is guided by the potential-dependent free energy change. It was found that on the FeNi-N6-C surface, the C&#8211;N coupling occurs between *NHO and the protonated CO2 in the potential window of &#8722;2.43 to &#8722;1.34 V for the urea electrochemical production, where the predicted onset potential accords well with the experimental results. The activity originates from the less weak bonding strength of N&#8211;O and the negatively charged N atom in *NHO. This study offers a general approach to determining the optimal reaction pathway in electrochemistry and insights into the mechanism of electrochemical synthesis of urea.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Microkinetic Modeling for CO&lt;sub&gt;2 &lt;/sub&gt;Reduction Reaction: Integrating Electrolyte Effects</title>

                In the current landscape of escalating global environmental challenges, the development of sustainable energy solutions has become increasingly critical. A pivotal area in this endeavor is the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) technology, which holds the promise of converting CO 2 , a major greenhouse gas, into valuable chemicals and fuels. The intricate nature of CO 2 RR, characterized by complex reaction pathways and a plethora of intermediates, presents significant scientific and engineering challenges. Key to surmounting these challenges is the accurate and comprehensive modeling of CO2RR processes. However, traditional computational models often overlook a crucial aspect &#8211; the influence of electrolyte interactions with CO 2 RR intermediates. This omission leads to models that inadequately capture the true dynamics of the electrochemical environment, resulting in less accurate predictions. In this work, we introduce CatEnergy, a Python module that enhances our existing microkinetic modeling tool, CatMAP[1], focusing on CO 2 RR. CatEnergy specifically addresses the complexity of CO 2 RR by integrating electrolyte interaction data. This integration enables a more accurate representation of the electrochemical environment, improving the predictive power and efficacy of CO 2 RR models. By generating essential electrolyte interaction data for microkinetic modeling, it facilitates more effective catalyst design and optimization of reaction conditions. This development is key in advancing the accuracy of microkinetic modeling for CO 2 RR and underscores our commitment to sophisticated tool development in sustainable energy research. [1] Medford, A.

      <title>Water-Insoluble Copper Complexes As Electrocatalysts for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-01372220mtgabs</link>
      <description>Rafael L. Romano, Kotaro Sasaki, F&#225;bio H. B. Lima, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-01(37)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401698432

                The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 R) constitutes a promising CO 2 utilization technology, allowing the production of valuable fuels and chemicals by using electrical energy from renewable sources. Nevertheless, poor selectivity and high required overpotentials hamper practical applications of the CO 2 R, which highlights the need for the development of more efficient electrocatalysts. Different copper-based materials have been extensively studied as electrocatalysts for CO 2 R. Particularly, copper complexes exhibited interesting properties under operational conditions: many of them undergo structural modifications (e.g. changes in oxidation state and/or coordination number), which potentially affect activity, selectivity and stability. Interestingly, some complexes exhibit reversible restructuring under specific conditions, which can be an interesting property to reach higher stability. In this presentation, we will show the results obtained for the electrocatalysis of water-insoluble copper complexes for the CO 2 R. The activity, selectivity and stability of both [Cu(bzimpy)Cl 2 ] and [Cu(pyrben) 2 (NO 3 )]NO 3 were investigated in K 2 SO 4 0.1 mol L -1 (CO 2 sat.) under different electrochemical conditions. Here, bzimpy and pyrben stand for 2,6-bis(2-benzimidazolyl)pyridine and 2-(2-pyridyl)benzimidazole, respectively. Qualitative EC-MS (Electrochemistry Coupled to Mass Spectrometry) analysis evidenced that both complexes are active for CO 2 reduction and that product distribution changes according to the applied potential. Quantitative gas chromatography measurements revealed that, at -1.24 V vs. RHE, [Cu(bzimpy)Cl 2 ] promotes the formation of H 2 , CO, CH 4 and C 2 H 4 with faradaic efficiencies of 26, 3.4, 9.2 and 31%, respectively. On the other hand, [Cu(pyrben) 2 (NO 3 )]NO 3 shows FE values of 24, 8.8, 15 and 24% for H 2 , CO, CH 4 and C 2 H 4 , respectively. After 1.6 h of electrolysis, the former exhibited stable current and FE of ~42% towards ethylene formation.</description>

                One of the main agents responsible for global warming is greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) associated with fuel combustion.Most works in the literature address logistics transportation from an economic perspective, giving little attention to the existing trade-off with sustainability.In this work, we develop two bi-objective mathematical models, one for the inventory routing problem with a heterogeneous fleet and another for the multimodal freight transportation problem, where we minimize costs while simultaneously reducing CO 2 emissions.First, we present an explicit vehicular equation that can statistically estimate CO 2 emissions for different vehicles and types of fuels.Next, we apply two bi-objective methods to the inventory routing problem, the augmented &#949;-constrained and the augmented Tchebycheff metric, to find the efficient Pareto frontier using a branch-and-cut method.For the multimodal freight transportation problems, we consider uncertainty in the origin nodes, apply probabilistic constraints, and also analyze the trade-off of the objective functions using the global criterion method and the augmented Tchebycheff metric.Computational experiments were conducted on instances adapted from the literature and others generated randomly, solving the bi-objective methods exactly.The analysis of the results indicates the approach's ability to balance economy and sustainability, where, on average, extreme solutions show a reduction of more than 50% in emissions and an increase of just over 30% in costs.Finally, the results of the solution methods applied to the two problems considering sustainability are presented and discussed.We detail a methodology for estimating CO 2 emissions, reflecting the complexity and the need to balance economic and ecological factors in logistic problems.</description>

      <title>Performance of an All-Aqueous Thermally Regenerative Flow Battery Using CNT/Carbon Cloth Composite Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.4c01842</link>

                All-aqueous thermally regenerative battery (ATRB) is a promising electrochemical device for converting low-grade waste heat into electrical energy, while the low specific surface area of electrodes limits its performance. To improve the performance, the carbon nanotube/carbon cloth (CNT/CC) composite electrode with a highly specific surface area is proposed for ATRB in this study. The use of the CNT/CC composite electrodes induces a 37.4% higher maximum power density of ATRB (409.6 W/m2) compared with that of ATRB with the carbon cloth (CC) electrodes. The optimal CNT loading amount is determined to further enhance ATRB performance. Increasing the flow rate helps facilitate mass transfer, the optimal flow rate (50 mL/min) is selected considering the influence of the hydrodynamic loss. Concerning the expend application, a series stack of ATRB is constructed to successfully drive an electrochemical CO2 reduction device, resulting in a comparable Faraday efficiency for the conversion of CO2 to CO.</description>

      <title>Identification of Patterns in CO2 Emissions among 208 Countries: K-Means Clustering Combined with PCA and Non-Linear t-SNE Visualization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/math12162591</link>
      <description>Ana Lorena Jim&#233;nez Preciado, Salvador Cruz Ak&#233;, Francisco Venegas-Mart&#305;&#769;nez, Mathematics. 12(16)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401794845

                This paper identifies patterns in total and per capita CO2 emissions among 208 countries considering different emission sources, such as cement, flaring, gas, oil, and coal. This research uses linear and non-linear dimensional reduction techniques, combining K-means clustering with principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which allows the identification of distinct emission profiles among nations. This approach allows effective clustering of heterogeneous countries despite the highly dimensional nature of emissions data. The optimal number of clusters is determined using Calinski&#8211;Harabasz and Davies&#8211;Bouldin scores, of five and six clusters for total and per capita CO2 emissions, respectively. The findings reveal that for total emissions, t-SNE brings together the world&#8217;s largest economies and emitters, i.e., China, USA, India, and Russia, into a single cluster, while PCA provides clusters with a single country for China, USA, and Russia. Regarding per capita emissions, PCA generates a cluster with only one country, Qatar, due to its significant flaring emissions, as byproduct of the oil industry, and its low population. This study concludes that international collaboration and coherent global policies are crucial for effectively addressing CO2 emissions and developing targeted climate change mitigation strategies.</description>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) has brought e-chemical production one step closer to commercialization because of its advantages of minimized ohmic resistance and stackability. However, the current performance of reported eCO2R in MEAs is still far below the threshold for economic feasibility where low overall cell voltage (&lt;2 V) and extensive stability (&gt;5 years) are required. Furthermore, while the production cost of e-chemicals heavily relies on the carbon capture and product separation processes, these areas have received much less attention compared to CO2 electrolysis, itself. In this perspective, we examine the current status of eCO2R technologies from both academic and industrial points of view. We highlight the gap between current capabilities and commercialization standards and offer future research directions for eCO2R technologies with the hope of achieving industrially viable e-chemical production.</description>

      <title>Economical deployment of quarry minerals for land-based enhanced weathering in Northern California</title>

                Enhanced weathering (EW) is a CO2 removal (CDR) and sequestration strategy that accelerates the natural reactions of minerals that can store carbon from the atmosphere and biotic reactions. One method of EW is to apply finely ground silicate rocks to agricultural lands. EW has been demonstrated in laboratory and field tests, but great uncertainty remains regarding the life-cycle of using locally available rocks on candidate soils. We evaluate the life-cycle impacts, job creation, and cost of scenarios where fines and rocks mined from quarries in Oregon and Northern California are transported by truck and tilled into agricultural soils. Candidate quarry dust samples were classified as dacite, andesite, and olivine-bearing rocks, with EW potentials ranging from 125-760 kg CO2/metric tonne rock. We determined the olivine-bearing rock from Southern Oregon could achieve a levelized cost of CDR under the DOE Earthshot target of $100/t CO2, as long as application rates are 25 t/ha or more. Even andesite and dacite materials reach lower costs than commercial direct air capture technologies, with reduction in fines purchase and transport costs critical for achieving the Earthshot target. The results suggest that low-cost EW can be achieved using natural quarry materials, with average removal up to 2.2 t CO2e per hectare per year.</description>

                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize the architectural design and energy management of green buildings, offering significant advancements in sustainability and efficiency. This paper explores the transformative impact of AI on improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions in commercial buildings. By leveraging AI algorithms, architects can optimize building performance through advanced environmental analysis, automation of repetitive tasks, and real-time data-driven decision-making. AI facilitates precise energy consumption forecasting and integration of renewable energy sources, enhancing the overall sustainability of buildings. Our study demonstrates that AI can reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions by approximately 8% and 19%, respectively, in typical mid-size office buildings by 2050 compared to conventional methods. Further, the combination of AI with energy efficiency policies and low-emission energy production is projected to yield reductions of up to 40% in energy consumption and 90% in CO2 emissions. This paper provides a systematic approach for quantifying AI's benefits across various building types and climate zones, offering valuable insights for decision-makers in the construction industry.</description>

      <title>LaCoO3 is a promising catalyst for dry reforming of benzene used as a surrogate of biomass tar</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.55730/1300-0527.3685</link>
      <description>Ba&#351;ar &#199;a&#287;lar, Deniz &#220;ner, TURKISH JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY. 48(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401854464

                Tar build-up is one of the bottlenecks of biomass gasification process. Dry reforming of tar is an alternative solution if oxygen chemical potential on the catalyst surface is at sufficient levels. For this purpose, an oxygen donor perovskite, LaCoO3, was used as a catalyst for dry reforming of tar. To circumvent the complexity of the tar and its constituents, benzene molecule was chosen as a model compound. Dry reforming of benzene vapour on the LaCoO3 catalyst was investigated at temperatures of 600, 700, 800 &#176;C, at the CO2/C6H6 ratios of 3, 6, 12 and at space velocities of 14000 and 28000 h-1. The conventional Ni(15 wt.%)/Al2O3 catalyst was also used as a reference material to determine the relative activity of the LaCoO3 catalyst. Different characterization techniques, such as X-Ray Diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, Temperature-programmed reduction, and oxidation were used to determine physicochemical characteristics of catalysts. The findings demonstrate that the LaCoO3 catalyst has a higher CO2 conversion, H2 and CO yields and better stability than the Ni(15 wt.%)/&#947;-Al2O3 catalyst. The improvement in activity is attributed to the strong capacity of LaCoO3 for oxygen exchange. The transfer of lattice oxygen from the surface of the LaCoO3 catalyst facilitates the oxidation of carbon and other surface species and leads to higher conversion and yields.</description>

      <title>Modeling Stochastic Kinetics of Cathodic Cu Surface Corrosion and Ionic Interaction in Nanoscopic Water Pools</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-01472616mtgabs</link>
      <description>Karnamohit Ranka, Richard Kang, Prabhat Prakash, Soonho Kwon, Frances A. Houle, Martin Head&#8208;Gordon, William A. Goddard, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-01(47)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401695369

                Cathodic Cu corrosion has been reported to occur in both the presence and absence of carbon dioxide in aqueous electrolytes and while the mechanism is not understood well it implies carbide-, hydride- and hydroxide-formation mediated pathways. Corrosion leads to roughening, which creates local pockets of electrolyte that are somewhat disconnected from the bulk. In this talk, we describe a combination of theoretical studies to identify reaction pathways, and kinetics modeling of them to obtain a working description of corrosion in water. Corrosion at metal surfaces is both influenced by and influences the formation of nanoscopic aqueous pools by trapping electrolyte solution in microscopic pockets. Such electrolyte nano-pools exhibit non-bulk behavior, and the lifetime of locally trapped ions can be significantly different than in the bulk. This can potentially have an effect on the chemistry in the local microenvironment. Stochastic reaction-diffusion models can be used to model kinetics of electrochemical processes at length and time scales relevant to laboratory experiments, allowing a direct comparison of transient observable quantities to time-resolved experimental data. Atomistic simulations employ methods of electronic structure theory (such as density functional theory (DFT)) and molecular dynamics (both classical and ab initio ) to describe a detailed picture of the (electro-)chemistry at microscopic time and length scales. Scaling up these methods to macroscopic levels is not trivial but required for direct comparison to experiment. By using Gibbs free energies obtained from atomistic simulations it is possible to calculate rate constants for individual elementary steps in reaction schemes describing kinetics of relevant processes. We use Kinetiscope to implement stochastic kinetics models of two reaction schemes describing: 1. cathodic Cu surface corrosion through formation of copper hydroxides, through which we aim to describe essential steps in the cathodic corrosion mechanism of metal surfaces; 2. interactions between bicarbonate and hydronium ions, both present in the bicarbonate salt buffers used routinely in electrochemical reduction at copper surfaces, in a nanoscopic water droplet to understand time-dependent changes in the local concentrations of electrolytes trapped at or near metal surfaces.

                Many European buildings require renovation, often involving window replacements and improved airtightness, leading to increased mold risk and indoor air quality (IAQ) issues. Solutions include adjustable air inlets with mechanical exhaust or balanced heat recovery ventilation. Using building performance simulations, we studied control strategies for renovated apartment building with natural or mechanical ventilation. CO2 - controlled air inlets proved most effective for IAQ and energy reduction. In different apartment positions, air inlet performance varied based on available stack effect. Mechanical exhaust cases were less affected by airtightness changes. Altogether, the mechanical ventilation was more robust, but all strategies were sensitive to closed doors.</description>

      <title>Influence of Carbon Nanotube Support on Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction Catalyzed by a Cobalt Complex</title>

                Access to clean water is a pressing environmental and public health concern. Excess nitrate (NO 3 - ) from the overuse of fertilizer finds its way into our surface water and groundwater, which leads to adverse health effects such as cancer and causes significant damage to ecosystems. 1-4 The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 RR) has emerged as a promising water treatment approach to address this issue. The NO 3 RR involves the transformation of waste NO 3 - into value-added nitrogen species, such as ammonia (NH 3 ), via reduction. NH 3 serves as a valuable chemical in various applications, including its use as a fertilizer, chemical precursor, fuel, and a potential hydrogen (H 2 ) carrier for energy storage and transportation. 5-7 Leveraging renewable energy, the NO 3 RR provides a sustainable approach to distributed NH 3 production, which stands in stark contrast to the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process. 8-10 As a result, there is growing interest in designing catalysts for the selective reduction of NO 3 - to NH 3 . However, this requires that we obtain a clear understanding of the role of each component in the catalyst structure. Molecular catalysts have unique advantages over other electrocatalytic materials due to their well-defined structures, which can be tailored through the choice of the metal center and ligands. 11,12 Moreover, molecular catalysts can be immobilized on substrates to create heterogeneous electrocatalysts capable of achieving a high current density. 13,14 In previous investigations, we showcased the efficacy of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a catalyst support for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions. 13,15 In heterogenized molecular catalysts, CNTs are generally believed to provide high surface area and electron conduction. However, our recent investigation reveals that CNTs can serve as catalysts themselves for the NO 3 RR, 16 which expands our understanding of the diverse roles CNTs play in NO 3 - reduction electrocatalysis. A major challenge in the field of electrocatalysis is the development of catalyst design strategies to control the reaction selectivity. We report on an underexplored approach to overcome this challenge by tuning the CNT support for a cobalt complex. With pristine CNTs as the support, the cobalt complex/CNT hybrid catalyst is selective for NO 3 - reduction to NH 3 with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 70%. In contrast, the cobalt complex supported on oxidized CNTs (OCNTs) generates mostly H 2 under the same conditions. On the basis of kinetic measurements which reveal that the rate-determining step of NO 3 &#8211; reduction is limited by the first electron transfer without involving a proton, we propose that the oxygen functional groups on the OCNT support help deliver protons and steer the supported cobalt complexes from catalyzing NO 3 - reduction to H 2 evolution. The performance of both of these hybrid catalysts is compared with the controls of bare CNTs and OCNTs. Additional control experiments include tests conducted in the absence of NO 3 - . These control experiments together with the rest of the experimental data provide strong evidence to support the notion that the product selectivity of the NO 3 RR catalyzed by cobalt complexes can be controlled via the CNT support. This study demonstrates the importance of tailoring the catalyst support to advance reactivity in catalysis for environmental remediation. References: Follett, R. F., et al.

                In an era of shifting the energy paradigm from fossil fuels to renewable energy, CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) emerges as a promising approach to covert greenhouse gas into valuable chemical fuels and close the carbon cycle for a sustainable energy supply. Since Cu remains the sole element for CO 2 RR to multicarbon products (C 2+ ), significant efforts have been devoted to developing Cu electrocatalysts with higher selectivity and activity. However, the complex nature of active sites and the intrinsic structures under reaction conditions have remained largely elusive due to the lack of operando / in situ methods. 1-3 In our previous studies, we reported that small Cu nanoparticles (sub-10 nm NPs) showed superior C 2+ superior C 2+ selectivity, relative to the larger sized Cu NPs, especially at low overpotentials. 4,5 In this work, we present a comprehensive operando correlative study of dynamic evolution during the life cycle of a family of monodisperse Cu NP ensemble electrocatalysts under CO 2 RR. 1 Operando electrochemical liquid-cell scanning transmission electron microscopy (EC-STEM) and 4D-STEM resolves microscopic dynamic morphological and structural evolution at the nm scale. Correlated operando high-energy-resolution fluorescence-detector (HERFD) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) 6 reveals dynamic macroscopic changes in valence states and coordination environment. Statistical analysis of interparticle dynamics was probed by operando resonant soft X-ray-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). 2 The operando correlative strategies, described herein, elucidates the longstanding enigmatic nature of Cu active sites as metallic Cu nanograins for selective CO 2 electroreduction (Fig. 1). The strategy described herein can serve as a general platform to resolve the electrocatalytic interface of nanoparticle catalysts under real-time operating conditions across multiple time and length scales, thus serving the fundamental understanding necessary to development of many other electrochemical reactions for renewable energy technologies.

                development and employment trends in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs). Cement-based materials are the most consumed in infrastructure projects, and embodied carbon in construction materials contribute approximately to 13% of the global GHG emissions. This paper presents findings of an experimental and environmental impact evaluation, conducted on Normal Strength Concrete (NSC) mixtures dosed with Opuntia ficus-indica mucilage (Ofim) as a bio-additive by mass-replacement of the mixing water. A 15% mixing-water mass-replacement resulted in 20% enhancement of compressive strength relative to the conventional mix. In addition, it achieved an average reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 9.6% with a notable decrease in CO2 equivalents resulting from a lower cement content in the Ofim-modified mix. Moreover, enhancement in durability properties of concrete elongates maintenance cycles reducing the demand for materials that would otherwise be used for frequent repairs. The study concluded that Ofim-modified concrete is an environmentally improved material.</description>

      <title>Aggregation of Albumins under Reductive Radical Stress</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25169009</link>
      <description>Karolina Radomska, Liwia Lebelt, Marian Wolszczak, International Journal of Molecular Sciences. 25(16)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401698307

                The reactions of radicals with human serum albumin (HSA) under reductive stress conditions were studied using pulse radiolysis and photochemical methods. It was proved that irradiation of HSA solutions under reductive stress conditions results in the formation of stable protein aggregates. HSA aggregates induced by ionizing radiation are characterized by unique emission, different from the UV emission of non-irradiated solutions. The comparison of transient absorption spectra and the reactivity of hydrated electrons (eaq&#8722;) with amino acids or HSA suggests that electron attachment to disulfide bonds is responsible for the transient spectrum recorded in the case of albumin solutions. The reactions of eaq&#8722; and CO2&#8226;&#8722; with HSA lead to the formation of the same products. Recombination of sulfur-centered radicals plays a crucial role in the generation of HSA nanoparticles, which are stabilized by intermolecular disulfide bonds. The process of creating disulfide bridges under the influence of ionizing radiation is a promising method for the synthesis of biocompatible protein nanostructures for medical applications. Our Raman spectroscopy studies indicate strong modification of disulfide bonds and confirm the aggregation of albumins as well. Low-temperature measurements indicate the possibility of electron tunneling through the HSA protein structure to specific CyS-SCy bridges. The current study showed that the efficiency of HSA aggregation depends on two main factors: dose rate (number of pulses per unit time in the case of pulse radiolysis) and the temperature of the irradiated solution.</description>

      <title>HYDRATION PROPERTIES AND TECHNICAL BEHAVIOUR OF BLENDED BELITE CALCIUM SULFOALUMINATE CEMENTS</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.18552/2024/scmt/115</link>

                Belite calcium sulfoaluminate (BCSA) cements are environmentally friendly binders inasmuch as they can allow a significant reduction in CO2 emissions thanks to the saving of both fuel consumption and limestone requirement. Compared to the production of ordinary Portland cement, the manufacture of BCSA cements is characterized by further relevant sustainable features, namely: (i) lower synthesis temperature (1250&#176;-1350&#176;C), (ii) easier clinker grindability and (iii) larger use of industrial wastes. Moreover, their environmental sustainability can be increased by the addition of supplementary cementitious materials. The aim of this paper is to compare the hydration behaviour and the technical properties of a blast furnace slag (17.5% by mass) or a coal fly ash (17.5% by mass)-blended BCSA binder with a plain BCSA-system. All the binders, containing 2.5% by mass of slaked lime, were investigated by means of calorimetric, X-ray diffraction and differential thermal-thermogravimetric analyses, mercury intrusion porosimetry, expansion/shrinkage tests and mechanical compressive strength measurements.</description>

                CO 2 capture and conversion represent one of the most critical challenges of our society. One sustainable approach to tackle it is the development of electrochemical processes coupling a solar-driven carbon dioxide reduction to CO/water oxidation to O 2 with reactions leading tohigh-value products . In such photoelectrochemical reactors, (photo)electrocatalysts and membranes play a crucial role to achieve high CO 2 conversion with minimum energy. The aim of this study is developing polymer membranes with high stability, mechanical resistance and ion conductivity, that can work in the broad pH operation range of CO 2 /H 2 O co-electrolysis cells. Consistently with the use of KOH at the anode, the used membrane is often an anion exchange membrane (AEM). However, carbonate crossover through AEM occurs during CO 2 electrolysis via diffusion and migration. [1] The use of a bipolar membrane (BPM) allows to mitigate this issue, bringing novel challenges of stability and performance. The BPM consists in a cation exchange layer (CEL) and an anion exchange layer (AEL), with a bipolar junction formed at their interface. Such membrane must guarantee a constant pH level generating H + and OH - by water dissociation at the junction, avoid product crossover, and optimize mass transfer and reactivity of coupled anodic and cathodic reactions. A crucial point is the control of the electrochemical behavior at the CEL/AEL interface. With this aim, a 3D-structure made of a network of fibers was developed [2, 3] providing a great interfacial area and mechanical interlocking of the anion and cation exchange ionomers preventing delamination and facilitating the exchange of ions and matter at the interface. Furthermore, such fiber webs allow the controlled deposition of inorganic or organic catalysts to enhance the water dissociation rate at the bipolar junction. The bipolar membrane was prepared interposing a web of electrospun fibers bearing water dissociation nanocatalysts at the interface between anion and cation exchange polymer layers. The prepared BPMs were characterized for their morphology, composition, ion conductivity, and performance.

                The electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO2R) to ethylene on copper-based catalysts has garnered significant attention for its potential in sustainable industrial practices. While substantial progress has been achieved in the development of small-scale electrolyzers with geometric areas ranging from 1 to 5 cm 2 , the imperative to address larger scales for industrial decarbonization necessitates a shift in focus. There are inherent critical risks when scaling a nascent technology like CO 2 electrolysis. There can be emergent phenomena observed only at larger scales, that can prevent it from reaching commercialization, such as change in local CO 2 concentration, defects in the porous transport layer, and temperature gradients The optimized conditions for operating a 5 cm 2 electrolyzer may not work well with a 25 cm 2 electrolyzer leading to failures. Therefore, there is a need to develop a systematic way to test for these phenomena to address these challenges to successfully operate a CO2R electrolyzer at an industrially relevant scale. In this work, we highlight the performance of a Cu-based catalyst designed for the selective reduction of CO2 to ethylene across varying scales, ranging from 5 to 100 cm 2 . This investigation shows the changes in the electrolyzer performance at different scales. Our findings highlight the critical importance of implementing engineering controls to overcome challenges associated with the scaling of electrolyzers. Specifically, we explore the impact of anolyte flow rate, gasket compression, and electrochemical pulsing techniques on maintaining the desired selectivity of the electrocatalyst across different scales. By systematically adjusting these parameters, we demonstrate the ability to mitigate non-linear effects and uphold the efficiency of CO 2 reduction to ethylene, even on larger electrode surfaces.

                Transition-metal-based solid-state electrocatalysts undergo dynamic phase transformation governed by the local electrochemical environment during operation, e.g., oxygen evolution/reduction( 1,2 ), hydrogen evolution( 3 ), and carbon dioxide reduction( 4 ). Electrochemical active species, often hidden before operation, can become evolved due to the applied electrochemical potential and/or surrounding chemicals. These species are stabilized under the local environment dynamically generated by the reaction product, e.g., proton (H + ) or hydroxyl (OH - ) group( 5,6 ). Active species often account for a small fraction (i.e., minor motif) of the entire catalyst volume, and the nanoscale morphology and chemical composition of the electrocatalyst are inhomogeneous and continuously change during the electrochemical reaction. Thus, capturing the active species remains a major challenge. Spatiotemporal observation of the structural/chemical changes of the electrocatalyst and the correlation with the local electrochemical environment may reveal the active species and elucidate the governing step toward their formation. Furthermore, identification of the key intermediate step of catalyst phase transformation allows the redirection of low- to high-active catalysts; however, this remains challenging. During electrochemical CO 2 reduction (ECR), (hydr)oxide-derived Cu electrocatalysts experience significant phase transformation and show high activity and selectivity for carbon dimerization (C&#8211;C coupling)( 7,8,9 ). The location and chemical composition of the active species evolving during electrochemical phase transformation may be strongly heterogeneous; however, these species have not been clearly determined. Recent studies have employed operando characterization techniques, e.g., fluorescence hard/soft X-ray( 4,10 ), X-ray photoelectron( 11 ), and Raman spectroscopy( 6 ), to elucidate the active species responsible for high C&#8211;C coupling activity. However, although these techniques could track the changes in chemical composition of the electrocatalysts during operation, they did not reveal the spatiotemporal evolution of the active species or existence of minor motifs, owing to their inefficient chemical sensitivity. Thus, it is imperative to develop an operando analysis technique that can probe the nanoscopic chemical composition with high spatial/temporal resolution and sufficient detection limit. By observing the chemical and morphological evolution of highly efficient ECR catalysts during operation, we identified the key intermediate species toward highly active surfaces and significantly enhanced the C&#8211;C coupling activity. Operando transmission soft X-ray microscopy( 1,12,13 ), which visualizes the nanoscale chemical composition distribution of Cu-based catalysts during ECR, revealed that partially evolved Cu + phases and surface Cu 2+ phases are responsible for the dynamic dissolution&#8211;redeposition process( 4,8 ) and improvement of C&#8211;C coupling activity, respectively. We further demonstrated that the dissolution&#8211;redeposition process is electrochemically triggered by inducing Cu + phases, which are redirected to copper-carbonate-hydroxide species( 6,14,15 ) even under high cathodic potentials. DFT calculations suggest that these cationic Cu species potentially serve as active species and/or assistive sites for enhancing C&#8211;C coupling activity. (1) Mefford, J. T., et al.

                X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful experimental technique used to study the electronic structure and local environment of atoms in a material. It provides valuable insights into the chemical bonding, oxidation states, and coordination geometry of elements. XAS has been widely applied in various fields of electrochemistry, including popular topics like the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).Despite the growing recognition of the practical importance of XAS techniques, correlating experimental spectroscopy with the working mechanisms and deciphering the structure of the electrochemical interface under reaction conditions remains challenging. In the case of CO2RR, we utilized operando XAS to investigate multiple Cu-based catalysts in different cell configurations. Our findings revealed that altering the reaction environment can induce an alternative pathway for catalyst structural changes. Moreover, operando XAS demonstrated that the reduction of Cu oxide catalysts is not solely governed by applied potentials but is also influenced by mass transport and other parameters. For ORR, in situ XAS not only provides information about the local environment changes of Pt-based catalysts but also unveils surface properties through &#9651;&#956;-X-ray adsorption near-edge spectroscopy (&#9651;&#956;-XANES). This further aids in the discovery of degradation mechanisms in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In the case of HER, in situ XAS enables characterization beyond catalysts and extends to the electrochemical interface. Overall, XAS techniques play a crucial role in understanding the electronic structure and local environment of atoms in electrochemical systems, shedding light on reaction mechanisms and catalyst performance under realistic conditions Acknowledgement The authors thank the funding source from Liquid Sunlight Alliance under the U.S. DOE, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Fuels Award Number DE-SC0021266 and the Laboratory Directed Research and Development Program of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under the U.S. DOE Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231.</description>

                The sustainable management of pig slurry (PS) in intensive farms is essential to reduce adverse environmental impacts and reduce the ecological footprint. If not managed properly, PS can release GHG/NH3 gases into the atmosphere and contaminate waters. This study evaluates the impact of an integral management system with physical and biological stages to mitigate the impact of PS. The system resulted in effective PS traceability, studying its physicochemical properties. The synergism in the whole system allowed a decrease in the most analyzed parameters during the autumn, spring, and summer. The pretreatment contributed significantly to obtaining an appreciable percentage of reduction in the constructed wetlands of SS (99&#8211;100%), COD (56&#8211;87%), TN (50&#8211;57%), and PO43&#8722; (88&#8211;100%). The emission values (g/m2/day) were 0&#8211;2.14 (CH4), 0&#8211;473.76 (CO2), 0&#8211;179.77 (H2O), 0&#8211;0.265 (N2O), and 0&#8211;0.195 (NH3), highlighting the raw, separated and manure fractions with the highest values. It is concluded that the system proves to be a practical, low-cost, and efficient technique for the treatment of PS. It significantly reduces the concentration of nutrients, and the intercepted byproducts can be valuable for application to the soil. In addition, the system effectively reduces GHG/NH3 emissions in decanted, purified, and wetland PS fractions.</description>

                Ice accumulation poses considerable challenges in transportation, notably in the domain of general aviation. The present study combines the strengths and limitations of conventional aircraft deicing techniques with the emerging trend toward all-electric aircraft. This study aims to utilize laser-induced graphene (LIG) technology to create a multifunctional surface, seamlessly integrating hydrophobic properties with efficient electrical heating to mitigate surface icing effectively. We investigated the utilization of a 10.6 &#956;m CO2 laser for direct writing on polyimide (PI), a widely used insulating encapsulation material. From the thermomechanical perspective, our initial analysis using COMSOL Multiphysics software (V5.6) revealed that when the laser power P exceeds 5 W, the PI substrate experiences ablative damage. The experimental results show that when P &#8804; 5 W, an increase in power has a positive impact on the quality, surface porosity, roughness reduction, line-spacing reduction, and water contact-angle enhancement of the graphene. Conversely, when P &gt; 5 W, higher power negatively affects both the substrate and the graphene structure by inducing excessive ablation. However, it influences the graphene line height positively and is consistent with overall experimental&#8211;simulation congruence. Furthermore, the incorporation of high-quality graphene resulted in a surface that exhibited higher contact angles (CA &gt; 120&#176;), lower energy consumption, and higher heating efficiency compared to the use of traditional electrically heated materials for anti-icing applications. The potential applications of this one-step fabrication method extend across various industries, particularly aviation, marine engineering, and other ice-prone domains. Moreover, the method has extensive prospects for addressing pivotal challenges associated with ice formation and serves as an innovative and efficient anti-icing technology.</description>

                The most challenging deal we face today is the need to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and tackle climate change. Though calls to reduce them are growing louder yearly, emissions remain unsustainably high. CO 2 is the key contributor to global climate change in the atmosphere. Electrochemical CO 2 reduction (EC CO 2 R) into chemicals or fuels holds great research interest as a promising approach to mitigate CO 2 emissions and reach a carbon-neutral future. 1 In this regard, an extraordinary effort has been made to discover new efficient and sustainable catalysts at the laboratory level over recent years. High-performance electrocatalysts in aqueous electrolytes often rely on noble metals, which may hinder their industrial applications. Herein, we successfully synthesized core-shell Cu 2 O/SnO 2 nanoparticles 2&#8211;4 functionalized with a silane group, using a simple and versatile methodology based on a three-step scalable synthesis method involving wet precipitation followed by salinization and, finally, a rhenium-based complex has been assembled by electro-polymerization. 5 The carbon paper-supported Cu 2 O/SnO 2 -Re electrocatalyst was characterized at 10 cm 2 scale achieving a CO:H 2 ratio from 3 to 9, and demonstrating an stable syngas production up to 24 hours at -20 mA&#183;cm -2 . To translate those developments from the laboratory level to a higher TRL towards the practical application of CO 2 capture and utilization 6 , an additional chamber was added to the system for the continuous CO 2 capture and electrochemical conversion, increasing the electrode area from 10 cm 2 to 100 cm 2 . Captured CO 2 co-electrolysis to syngas (H 2 :CO ratio of 5) in one step was demonstrated with a high CO 2 conversion at a current up to -2 A, indicating the scale-up potential of this intensified system. The technology is currently under validation in a TRL4 reactor composed of an array of 5 modules ( i.e. , 4 x 5 cells x 100 cm 2 ) with a total active area of or 0.2m 2 for direct CO 2 conversion from simulated anthropogenic sources. The design integrates low-cost photovoltaic (PV) cells to provide any required additional bias to drive the reaction, thus, Perovskite PV panels with a cost of up to 5 times lower (10 &#8364;/m 2 ) than Si PV cells were used. The TRL5 demonstration of the developed technology will be done with real flue gas emissions the first semester of 2024.

      <title>Iron Production By Molten Sulfide Electrolysis</title>

                With urgency and incentives to cut CO2 emissions, alongside increasing demand for steel, there is a need for technologies that use solely electricity for iron ore reduction, eliminating the role of carbon as a reductant. Herein, we propose the electrolytic production of liquid cast iron using a novel sulfide route, molten sulfide electrolysis (MSE). The process operates using sulfide chemistry and an inert anode. Sulfides are well known from non-ferrous metallurgy1 and the exclusion of oxygen supports a virtual elimination of green-house gases(GHG) emissions from the reduction step. The electrolytic decomposition of iron sulfide into iron and elemental sulfur gas operates in a multi-component molten sulfide electrolyte. The underlying thermodynamics suggests the absence of trivalent iron species (Fe3+) in such conditions, supporting the reduction of only divalent iron (Fe2+) and reducing the energy need proportionally, as compared to other oxide-based routes. Iron sulfide deposits or tailings, as well as conventional iron oxide ores after sulfidation 2 are some of the suitable feedstocks for MSE. Both thermal only, and galvanostatic electrochemical experiments were carried out on electrolyte droplets (~200mg) in a thermal imaging furnace, to confirm the electrolytic deposition of Fe and the evolution of sulfur in a 2-electrode set-up. Faradaic efficiency estimates based on mass-loss measurements &#8211; i.e. with respect to gaseous sulfur anodic evolution &#8211; are of the order of 90%. Key electrochemical attributes of MSE to be reported include impedance measurement at various fixed DC potentials, measurements at various current densities up to 2A/cm2, and the role of the total charge passed, to highlight the potential limitations observed in such an experimental set up. Characterization of the electrochemical deposits are also presented.

                Installations of telecommunications base stations necessary to address the surging demand for new services are traditionally powered by conventional energy sources, which results in massive electricity consumption and CO2 emissions as a portion. In this paper we assess the benefits of adopting renewable energy resources to make telecommunications network greener and cost-efficient, tacking &#8220;3E&#8221; combination-energy security, environmental sustainability, economic development. The study first reviews the seemingly insatiable demand for energy in telecommunications filtering its historical use against the inefficacy and environmental impact of typical fossil power. Followed by the advantages renewable energy offers in terms of lower GHG emissions, cost reduction and increased reliability / resilience. The possibility of powering BTSs by using renewable power sources such as solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, and hybrid systems is also considered. Case studies show some real-world projects and their success stories to highlight the benefits as well as draw out here best practices in implementation for those inclined. The paper also presents some future and novel trends that could improve the sustainability, efficiency of telecommunication infrastructure. This review provides an overview of the renewable energy assessment in LTE systems and underlines its importance to drive telecom sector transformation, developing sustainability strategies, and alleviating global energy scarcity issues. &#8203;</description>

                The electrification of chemical manufacturing is an important pathway toward reduced CO 2 emissions. Direct electrochemical CO 2 reduction can thereby become a key technology. CO 2 electrolyzers produce cathodically platform chemicals as CO, format, ethanol or ethylene. The state-of-the-art anode process is the oxygen electro evolution which suffers from high over potentials and moderate valorization. An alternative is the anodic oxidation of biomass to valorized carbonaceous products, such as the oxidation of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to the biopolymer precursor 2.5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). In this work we report the design of electrolyzers flow cells with paired valorization of biomass and CO 2 . NiNC cathode GDEs are used for CO 2 reduction to CO and NiFe-LDH anodes for the HMF oxidation in a zero-gap membrane electrolyzer flow cells. We used a bipolar membrane to separate and optimize either half-cell reactions. Inside the membrane, water is dissociated and the protons will neutralize carbonates on the cathode which is beneficial for a higher CO 2 utilization and single pass. So, we can report close to 95% FE and 100% utilization efficiency towards CO. On the other hand, the hydroxide will stabilize the anode pH and enable PGM-free anodes compared to AEM CO 2 electrolyzer. State-of-the-art HMF oxidation is a semi-batch setup, in which the HMF containing anolyte is recycled to complete HMF depletion and utilization. This design suffered from severe mass limitations. Therefore, we modified the semi-batch process into a continuous process and made tradeoffs between faradaic efficiency and utilization. As HMF is not stable in alkaline solutions we decided that a high utilization is beneficial because the intermediates are stable and could be recycled. We can report a single pass conversion of around 70 % towards FDCA at 200 mA cm -2 at a total utilization of 90%. Figure caption: Paired continuous HMF/CO2 electrolyzer with performance parameter.

                This study addresses the urgent need to focus on the nitrite reduction reaction (NO2&#8211;RR) to ammonia (NH3). A ternary-metal Prussian blue analogue (CoCuFe-PBA) was utilized as the template material, leveraging its tunable electronic properties to synthesize CoCuFe oxide (CoCuFe-O) through controlled calcination. Subsequently, a CoCuFe alloy (CoCuFe-A) was obtained via pulsed laser irradiation in liquids. The electrochemical properties of CoCuFe-O, derived from the PBA crystal structure, demonstrated a high yield of NH4+ at a rate of 555.84 &#956;mol h&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2, with the highest Faradaic efficiency of 91.8% and a selectivity of 97.3% during a 1-h NO2&#8211;RR under an optimized potential of &#8722;1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed the collaborative role of redox pairs (Co3+/Co2+ and Fe3+/Fe2+) as proton (H+) suppliers, with Cu centers serving as NO2&#8211; binders, thereby enhancing the reaction rate. Additionally, theoretical studies confirmed that Fe and Co atoms are more reactive than Cu toward intermediates playing crucial roles in hydrogenation, while Cu primarily activates NO owing to hydrogenation by the Fe and Co atoms and a high kinetic barrier in H2O* adsorption. This comprehensive investigation provides valuable insights into the electrochemical NO2&#8211;RR, establishing a foundation for efficient and sustainable NH3 synthesis strategies.</description>

                Carbon-supported nitrogen-coordinated single-metal site catalysts (i.e., M&#8722;N&#8722;C, M: Fe, Co, or Ni) are active for the electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to CO. (1) We comprehensively engineered FeN 4 and NiNx sites for electrochemical CO 2 reduction to CO considering the particle sizes of the catalysts, metal content, and the M&#8722;N (M: Fe or Ni) bond structures. (2, 3) The unique M-N-C model allows us to elucidate each factor&#8242;s role exclusively regarding the promotion of CO 2 reduction. (4) Optimal particle sizes and Fe content provide favorable external factors to improve mass activity. Structural changes of M&#8722;N bonds controlled by thermal activation temperatures can intrinsically enhance CO selectivity and kinetic activity. Notably, the NiN 3 active sites with optimal local structures formed at higher temperatures ( e.g. , 1200 &#176;C) are intrinsically more active and CO-selective than NiN4, providing a new opportunity to design a highly active catalyst via populating NiN 3 sites with increased density. Further improving their intrinsic activity and selectivity by tuning their N&#8722;M bond structures and coordination is limited. We further expand the coordination environments of M&#8722;N&#8722;C catalysts by designing dual-metal active sites. (5) The Ni-Fe catalyst exhibited the most efficient CO2RR activity and promising stability compared to other combinations. Advanced structural characterization and theoretical prediction suggest that the most active N-coordinated dual-metal site configurations are 2N-bridged (Fe-Ni)N 6 , in which FeN4 and NiN4 moieties are shared with two N atoms. Two metals (i.e., Fe and Ni) in the dual-metal site likely generate a synergy to enable more optimal *COOH adsorption and *CO desorption than single-metal sites (FeN 4 or NiN 4 ) with improved intrinsic catalytic activity and selectivity.

                Understanding the molecular level foundations of CO 2 capture and conversion might unveil design strategies for efficient materials for these key decarbonization technologies. The control over the reaction channel in the complex network of reactions to produce selectively and on-demand chemicals from CO 2 via electrocatalysis is appealing to scientists worldwide on a fundamental and technological level. Operando techniques have become very popular to help achieve this goal as demonstrated by a flourishing number of dedicated studies [1-3] and other initiatives for discussion [4-6]. In this contribution, I will present recent work on the spectroscopic characterisation of the CO 2 interaction with several prototypical nanostructural systems of relevance, [7-11] emphasising characteristic spectroscopic fingerprints and their critical assessment. This contribution aims to discuss opportunities and current limitations encountered in situ X-ray methods to extract mechanistic insights. [1] Y. Han, H. Zhang, Y. Yu, Z.

                The electrochemical CO 2 reduction in membrane electrolyzer devices can become a key technology to close the anthropologic carbon cycle. For industrialisation of CO 2 electrolyzers, however, performance shortcomings of today&#8217;s state-of-art electrolyzer designs and cathodes have to be addressed. Alkaline Membrane CO 2 electrolyzers suffer from low utilization efficiency of CO 2 due to an acid-base CO 2 loss to carbonates, which limits the CO 2 utilization efficiency and single pass conversion to 50% in AEM CO 2 -to-CO electrolyzer. Bipolar Membrane CO 2 electrolyzers suffer from high cell voltage and lower Faradic efficiencies due to the acidic environment. All thoses designs suffer from layer flooding or salting events which limit the durability of the cells. New cell designs and new diagnostic tools are needed to predict, diagnose, and eliminate detrimental operating regimes of CO 2 electrolyzers. In this work, we report on NiNC catalyst-based cathode GDEs for CO 2 reduction to CO in a zero-gap membrane electrolyzer cell. We compare AEM and BPM cell designs. We propose the carbon crossover coefficient, CCC, as a new diagnostic analysis tool to monitor and understand through- or in-plane mass transport limitations in AEM and BPM cells. We also demonstrate how N2 bleeds can be used as diagnostic tools to recognize salting inside the electrolyzer cell. In our AEM studies, we show that sufficient CO 2 access to the catalyst surface sites is important to achieve a high performance. Under near neutral conditions on the anode we report 85% FE towards CO at 300 mA cm -2 at 3.6 V with single pass conversion of 40% which is very close to the theoretical maximum. In addition, we can report high energy efficiency but only a utilization efficiency of around 50%. In our BPM studies, we show that NiNC GDEs are active and stable cathodes in zero-gap membrane electrolyzer. Protons raise the utilization efficiency as the carbonate will decompose into CO 2 and water. To handle the changed electro osmotic water drag we replaced the ionomer with PTFE and could achieve 82% FE and 69% single pass conversion at 500 mA cm -2 with close to 100% CO 2 utilization efficiency towards CO. We show that using a either an AEM or BPM electrolyzer design we can reach over 100h stable performance at 100 mA cm -2 .

                Electrochemical CO 2 reduction (CO2RR) is a leading sustainable approach for transforming atmospheric CO 2 into valuable chemicals. This electrocatalytic process relies on a delicate balance of electron and proton transfer steps, resulting in the formation of diverse 1-carbon and some 2-carbon products, contingent on the surface properties. Extensive exploration of various transition metals for CO2RR has revealed that the binding strength of reaction intermediates on these metals significantly influences product selectivity. Notably, metals such as Au, Ag, Pd, Zn, Cd, Bi, Sn, and In, recognized for their activity in CO2RR, exhibit lower binding strengths for CO 2 intermediates, leading to the predominant production of either HCOOH or CO as sole products. In contrast, Cu, with its moderate ability to bind CO2RR intermediates, yields multiple products during CO2RR, albeit with reduced selectivity [1]. Moreover, the overall efficiency of CO 2 conversion is hampered by the simultaneous occurrence of the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the potentials required for producing desired products. Thus, it is imperative to develop new, effective catalysts. Catalysts capable of suppressing HER while enhancing selectivity are essential for advancing the overall efficiency of CO 2 conversion [2]. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are a relatively new class of materials that hold great promise due to their high specific activity and maximum atom utilization [3]. These catalysts often provide singular types of active sites, enhancing selectivity in reactions. However, the vast array of possible SACs, deployable on various supports, makes it impractical, if not possible, to use the traditional trial-and-error studies to yield high performing catalysts within reasonable timeframes. To navigate this complexity, theoretical investigations, especially DFT computations and machine learning techniques, have emerged as powerful tools. They can facilitate the identification of suitable catalyst structures and enable the precise engineering of atomic arrangement, therefore achieving targeted product formation from CO 2 with enhanced conversion efficiency. Additionally, conventional synthesis methods suffer from various drawbacks, involving multiple steps, harsh conditions, and a lack of control over the metal site distribution in the carbon matrix, limiting the desired coordination structure [4, 5]. Therefore, the work presented in this talk represents our combined experimental-theoretical effort. Specifically, Cu single atoms were strategically deposited onto defective carbon supports and systematically investigated for their performance as CO 2 RR electrocatalysts. These catalysts were inspired by DFT results showing how the product profile could be manipulated on catalyst surfaces, along with a prediction of the most likely products that would arise from the reaction. These catalysts were synthesized using a novel method denoted as switched solvent synthesis. This approach involves initially impregnating metals onto a carbon support, followed by switching the solvent from aqueous to an organic solvent with a higher dipole moment, and subsequently reducing the resulting mixture under an H 2 environment. This innovative method offers notable advantages, enabling the efficient production of SACs in less time, at lower temperatures (~100-500 &#176;C), and with high yields. In this study, Cu SACs were synthesized, and the influence of reaction parameters on the distribution of Cu metal atoms was systematically examined. The confirmation of SAC formation was achieved through various characterization techniques, including aberration-corrected STEM, XRD, and XPS. To assess the electrochemical activity and CO 2 reduction abilities of the Cu SACs, electrochemical characterization techniques were employed under both He and CO 2 -saturated 0.1 M KHCO 3 electrolytes. Furthermore, the product distribution and CO 2 conversion efficiencies, including activity, stability, selectivity, and faradaic efficiency, of the Cu SACs were rigorously evaluated through electrolysis in a flow cell setup. Quantification of the results was performed using an integrated GC/MS instrument. References: [1] V.S.S. Mosali, A.M. Bond, J.

                Conventional low-temperature water electrolysis processes operate either at high or low pH to enhance conductivity, minimizing electrical resistance. Neutral water electrolysis in a buffer solution is considered non-competitive due to higher energy consumption. Nevertheless, interest in water electrolysis using a salt-based electrolyte has grown due to its ability to generate a pH gradient inside the cell. Electrolysis using a neutral salt-based electrolyte has higher operating costs due to its higher standard equilibrium potential (due to the pH gradient) and lower conductivity. Although this approach incurs higher operating costs, it presents a unique advantage: the production of additional valuable elements thanks to the pH gradient generated. In 2019, Ellis &amp; al. [1] highlighted the possibility to use this pH gradient to electrify the production of hydrated lime (calcium hydroxide). Lime has applications in different areas such as the removal of impurities during steel production and aqueous or gaseous effluent treatments. It can also be used as a precursor of cement. Cement production is accounting for 8% of global CO 2 emissions. The acidity generated by water oxidation at the anode dissolves the calcium carbonate inserted. Carbon dioxide from the dissolution is recovered with the oxygen generated. The calcium cations migrate through the cationic membrane towards the cathodic compartment to react with the hydroxide ions generated by water reduction at the cathode. Calcium hydroxide is finally collected after precipitation. Figure 1 compares the conventional process with the electrochemical way and describes more precisely the steps involved in Figure 1. More recently, another way of exploiting this gradient has been proposed by Ni &amp; al. [2] for the recycling of spent Li-ion batteries. With the growing interest in process electrification, other applications may emerge. In this paper, this hybrid electrochemical system for the simultaneous production of hydrogen, oxygen and calcium hydroxide has been intensively studied. Water electrolysis has been performed in a two-compartment cell at different applied currents. Calcium concentration and pH measurement enabled the study of the sub-step efficiencies and equilibria in anodic and cathodic chambers. Perfect faradic efficiencies were obtained with perchlorate salt electrolytes and platinum-free electrodes. The establishment of the pH gradient has been proven and correlated with the transport number of protons through the cationic membrane. Finally, the kinetics of calcium ion migration and calcium hydroxide precipitation have been investigated as well. Continuous addition of calcium carbonate as opposed to a single excess addition was shown to be able to tune the working pH in the anodic compartment and thereby reducing the risk of precipitation on the membrane. Our experimental results lead to the formulation of practical recommendations for achieving optimal reaction stoichiometry in each stage. These findings pave the way for scaling up a promising new sustainable process for lime and cement production. [1] L. D. Ellis, A. F. Badel and M. L.

      <title>A Spray-Drying Approach for Highly Active Amorphous NiFe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; for AEM Water Electrolysis</title>

                Water electrolysis, a key process for hydrogen production, holds immense potential in mitigating carbon dioxide emissions when powered by renewable energy sources, thereby contributing to a sustainable and clean energy future. Commercially available and widely recognized technologies for water electrolysis include the proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) and the traditional alkaline water electrolysis (AWE). In order to use the benefits of both systems, the anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) method is proposed, enabling the utilization of non-noble catalyst materials and achieving high current densities at low cell voltages [1]. In the present work, the influence of a spray-drying approach compared to a co-precipitation method on the bimetallic non-noble NiFe 2 O 4 catalysts on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity is systematically investigated. State of the art catalyst for OER is Iridium oxide and so far, the best non-noble catalyst has not been found yet. A widely used non-noble catalyst is NiFe- layered double hydroxide but it suffers from low electric conductivity [2]. Another promising catalyst is the NiFe 2 O 4 , which also provides low OER overvoltage. However, amorphous oxides are said to have a higher activity than crystalline [3]. Furthermore, the use of a spray drying approach is highly reproducible, with which the crystallinity can be set very easily [4, 5]. The experimental study of the catalysts was carried out in a commercial Baltic-Fuel Cell with a geometrical area of 25 cm&#178; at 60 &#176;C in 1 M KOH electrolyte and a contact pressure of 1.25 MPa. The electrodes were prepared by directly spray coating the desired amount of catalyst onto the anode and cathode substrates. A Bekipor&#174; 2NI 18-0.25 nickel felt was used as the substrate for the anode, while AvCarb MGL370 carbon paper was employed for the cathode. As cathode catalyst Pt/C from Tanaka (TEC10E40E, 37.2 % Pt) was used, while a loading of 0.5 mg cm -2 Pt was targeted during the spraying procedure. On the anode, the NiFe 2 O 4 loading was set to 2 mg cm -2 . Both electrodes were separated by a Sustainion&#174; X37-50 Grade T membrane. For determination of relevant catalyst activity data chronopotentiometry (CP) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out. Figure 1 reveals that the spray-dried NiFe 2 O 4 (amorphous, red curve) has a superior performance compared to the precipitated NiFe 2 O 4 (green curve) , which is partly crystalline. With the spray-dried catalyst, a reduction in overvoltage of approx. 60 mV at 1 A cm -2 can be achieved. With a cell voltage of less than 1.7 V at a current density of 1 A cm -2 , our recently developed catalyst ranks among the most outstandingly described in the literature to date [6]. These findings can contribute to a further development of amorphous catalysts with even higher activity. [1] Cossar, E., Murphy, F. and Baranova, E.A.

      <title>Impact of Exposed Crystal Facets on Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity in Zeolitic Imidazole Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-01442432mtgabs</link>

                Oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) are critical reactions for efficient sustainable and renewable energy storage. However, the limitation of ORR is a slow kinetic reaction due to the multi-step transfer mechanism of electrons. Therefore, electrocatalysts with high ORR activity and stability are needed to overcome the reaction limitations. Zeolitic imidazole framework-67 (ZIF-67) has attracted attention in electrochemical applications due to its multiple redox-active sites and high stability in alkali conditions. The Co-doped porous carbon catalysts derived from ZIF-67 have the potential to be used as ORR catalysts with high performance, while pure phase ZIF-67 electrocatalyst for ORR is rarely studied. The work studies the importance of crystal facets on ORR reactivity. The results show that ZIF-67 nanocube exhibits excellent ORR activity with lower half wave-potential and faster kinetics process compared to its bulk structure. It is proposed that ZIF-67 nanocube provides improvement of selectivity for the four-electron pathway, which is a favorable process with higher reaction efficiency. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest unsaturated Co2+ active sites with enriched (100) facets in the cubic crystal. Therefore, the fast diffusion of oxygen molecules to active sites and strong interaction with intermediate are observed in a cubic structure. The correspondence between experiment and calculation offers enhancement of ORR activity and selectivity from control-specific growth of (100) facet with cubic shape. The work introduces a new strategy for designing highly efficient ORR electrocatalysts with facet-controlled, allowing further study in other electrochemical reactions.</description>

                CO 2 electrolysis (CO2E) and anion-exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) have both been identified as promising technologies for reducing emissions from the industrial and energy sectors in pursuit of achieving net-zero goals. 1,2,3,4 Recent developments of electrocatalysts, membranes, and electrolyser cell design have resulted in rapid progress of CO2E and AEMWE, achieving high current densities and faradaic efficiencies at the laboratory scale. 1,2 However, the long-term stability of these technologies requires improvement if they are to be deployed at commercially relevant scales. 2,5 Unfortunately, degradation phenomena such as; cathode flooding 6, 10 , catalyst degradation 7 , membrane instability 8,9 , and salt precipitation 10 are difficult to diagnose electrochemically, without the ability to decouple resistance contributions in-situ .We have therefore developed a 3-electrode technique and explored protocols that allow for the decoupling of cathode and anode overpotentials during long-term stability measurements. By using an edge-type reference electrode connected to the membrane through a liquid electrolyte bridge, we successfully demonstrate the ability to assess the performance of individual components within different membrane-electrode assembly (MEA) configurations. We highlight instabilities with using edge-type reference electrodes such as changes in the pH of the electrolyte bridge, and discuss efforts to mitigate these issues to permit long-term stability testing. We then demonstrate how this method can be used to provide more insights into degradation phenomena in both CO 2 and AEM water electrolyser cells, showing early diagnosis - up to 7 hours before detection from a conventional 2-electrode set-up - of failure mechanisms during stability testing. The proposed 3-electrode technique is capable of separating anode and cathode overpotentials over the course of extended testing periods and provides a platform to study the electrochemical response of individual electrolyser components to various degradation phenomena, and the durability of CO2E and AEMWE materials. Critical gaps in knowledge surrounding these issues can be better understood, which will enable these technologies to advance to the next stages of development.

      <title>(Invited) Nanowire Catalysts and Adsorbents</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-0110933mtgabs</link>
      <description>Mahendra K. Sunkara, Abhinav Nouduri, Hari Prasad Reddy Kannapu, Praveen Meduri, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-01(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401697797

                The unique properties of nanowire materials like fast charge transport, short diffusion length, controlled surface sites and single crystal nature make them ideal for designing high performance catalysts, adsorbents and electrocatalysts by design. To realize any of these applications, one would need either large quantities of nanowire powders or nanowire arrays on large areas. In this presentation, we will highlight our group&#8217;s efforts with scalable methods for continuous manufacturing of nanowire powders and arrays for oxides 1 and III-nitride materials. 2 The process for producing metal oxide nanowires has been scaled up to ton-scale. The resulting nanowire powders can be used to formulate unique catalyst and adsorbent products. Zinc oxide nanowires alloyed with catalytically active metals and have been formulated into ultra-deep desulfurization catalytic adsorbents. 3,4 These materials exhibited ultra-deep desulfurization with sulfur removal down to 1 ppm or below for liquid hydrocarbons (diesel, gasoline and naphthalene) and to less than 1 ppb for natural gas. The desulfurization mechanism does not involve formation of H 2 S species unlike that typically observed with hydro-desulfurization process involving sulfided catalysts. Titania nanowires supported with nickel and molybdenum clusters have also shown to exhibit high activity and durability as hydro-desulfurization catalysts for removal of sulfur from hydrocarbons by forming H 2 S. 5 The synergistic activity with MoS 2 and titania are expected to contribute to enhanced activity with desulfurization. Alloying of nanowires with other elements is also studied to produce compound and alloyed nanowires. Fundamental studies have shown that alloying process occurs at much lower temperatures than decomposition temperatures for precursors used. Alloying studies have clearly shown that the solubility in nanowires to be much more than that expected for bulk materials systems. This presentation will provide several examples in which nanowires were alloyed with elements at compositions more than that expected for thermodynamic solubility. In the case of CO 2 sorbents, alkali metal oxide nanowires have shown high capacity for CO 2 sorption as high as 75% by wt. The alkali metal oxide nanowires have been alloyed with alkali hydroxides to produce alkali metal oxide compound nanowires. These solid sorbents showed selective CO 2 sorption from a variety of streams including air, exhausts containing CO 2 at various concentrations. Nanowire geometry for these nanowires allow for non-sinterability, and smaller length scales for rapid diffusion of alkali ions allow for fast kinetics and regenerability. 6,7 Acknowledgements: Authors also acknowledge contributions from Drs.

                Lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction (Li-N2R) can be distributed and powered by renewable energy, making it a sustainable ammonia production alternative to the Haber Bosch process. While Haber Bosch is responsible for 1.3% of CO2 emissions yearly and requires centralized facilities with high temperatures and pressures, Li-N2R works at near-ambient conditions and therefore allows for decentralized production. 1 First, lithium (Li + ) ions electroplate as lithium metal on the working electrode. Second, the deposited lithium reacts with N 2 gas to form lithium nitride (Li 3 N). Lastly, Li 3 N reacts with a proton source to form ammonia (NH 3 ) (Figure Right). During Li-N2R, the NH 3 selectivity is controlled through the mass transport of N 2 , Li + , and protons to the working electrode electrode (WE). The transport of these species is limited by the solid electrolyte interface (SEI), a passivation layer formed on top of the WE. 2 The thickness and ratio of organic and inorganic species in the SEI change at different cycling temperatures, thus affecting the rates of transport between charge and uncharged species traveling to and from the electrode. Here, we study the impacts of temperature on FE and SEI composition in 1M LiBF 4 in both diglyme (DG) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) with a 1v% ethanol (EtOH) proton source (Figure Left). Using ion chromatography (IC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) on the SEI dissolved in D 2 O, we quantify the SEI species formed at different cycling temperatures. Our correlation of temperature and SEI compositions to FE provide opportunities to engineer the SEI for improved Li-N2R FE and stability. 1 J. W. Erisman et al., Nat.

      <title>Disentangling the dust and gas contributions of the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz28</title>

                Recent spectra of protoplanetary disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS), captured by the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), reveal a rich carbon chemistry. Current interpretations of these spectra are based on 0D slab models and provide valuable estimates for molecular emission temperatures and column densities in the innermost disk ($ radius au$). However, the established fitting procedures and simplified models are challenged by the many overlapping gas features. We aim to simultaneously determine the molecular and the dust composition of the disk around the VLMS Sz\,28 in a Bayesian way. We modelled the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz\,28 up to $17\ m$ using the Dust Continuum Kit with Line emission from Gas (DuCKLinG). Systematically excluding different molecules from the Bayesian analysis allowed for an evidence determination of all investigated molecules and isotopologues. We continued by examining the emission conditions and locations of all molecules, analysing the differences to previous 0D slab fitting, and analysing the dust composition. We find very strong Bayesian evidence for the presence of C2H2 HCN C6H6 CO2 HC3N C2H6 C3H4 C4H2 and CH4 in the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz\,28. Additionally, we identify CH3 and find tentative indications for NH3 . There is no evidence for water in the spectrum. However, we show that column densities of up to $2 $ could be hidden in the observational noise if assuming similar emission conditions of water as the detected hydrocarbons. Contrary to previous 0D slab results, a C4H2 quasi-continuum is robustly identified. We confirm previous conclusions that the dust in Sz\,28 is highly evolved, with large grains ($5\ m$) and a high crystallinity fraction being retrieved. We expect some of the stated differences to previous 0D slab fitting results to arise from an updated data reduction of the spectrum, but also due to the different modelling process. The latter reason underpins the need for more advanced models and fitting procedures.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of SEI Formation and Faradaic Efficiency in Electrochemical Lithium Mediated Nitrogen Reduction to Ammonia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-015772mtgabs</link>
      <description>Alden O'Rafferty, Peter Benedek, Valerie A. Niemann, Adam C. Nielander, Thomas F. Jaramillo, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-01(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401696153

                Lithium-mediated nitrogen reduction (Li-N2R) is a promising electrochemical ammonia production alternative to the Haber Bosch process, a process responsible for 1.3% of CO2 emissions yearly. 1 While Haber Bosch requires high temperatures and pressures in large centralized facilities, Li-N2R works at near-ambient temperatures and pressures allowing for decentralized production and can be powered by renewable electricity sources. In Li-N2R, Li ions are plated as Li metal on the working electrode, which then reacts with N 2 gas to form lithium nitride (Li 3 N). Lithium nitride reacts with a proton source to form ammonia (NH 3 ) (Figure left). Past research indicates that the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formed in the electrochemical system has a large impact on the NH 3 faradaic efficiency (FE) of the cell. 2 Variations in the temperature during cell cycling can influence both the thickness and composition of the SEI. This, in turn, alters the kinetics of species transport to and from the electrode. Consequently, SEIs formed at different temperatures lead to varying proportions of products in the reaction, and are a helpful tool to tune the system towards NH 3 selectivity. We elucidate temperature effects on SEI formation and FE for electrolytes with 1M LiBF 4 in two common solvents, Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diglyme (DG), with a 1v% ethanol (EtOH) proton source (Figure right). We also confirm the validity of our results with an Ar control. By dissolving SEI species in a D 2 O rinsate, we can quantify the composition of the SEI formed at different temperatures using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and ion chromatography (IC). With our strategy, we correlate SEI composition trends with changes in FE, and provide pathways towards engineering the SEI for enhanced Li-N2R FE to NH 3 and improved electrolyzer lifetime. 1 J. W.

      <title>Decision Support System for Sustainable Retrofitting of Existing Commercial Office Buildings</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.18535/ijsrm/v12i08.em20</link>
      <description>Calistus Bengold Anarene, Swapan Saha, Peter J. Davies, Dr MD Kamrul, International Journal of Scientific Research and Management (IJSRM). 12(08)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401828729

                With more than 60% of the inventory being over thirty years old, commercial office buildings represent a substantial global energy consumer. The Australian government has attempted to lower greenhouse gas emissions through legislation, but the implementation of these efforts has only resulted in annual reductions of 1-3%. It is essential to focus energy-efficient interventions on the stock of current commercial buildings if we are to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Energy performance, efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions can all be improved in commercial buildings by reducing energy consumption. According to Climate Works Australia and the IPCC, there is a 30% chance of avoiding current energy use while still reaping net economic benefits. To lessen global warming, the IPCC has also recommended that developed nations, like Australia, reduce emissions by 45% by 2030. Buildings with passive technologies can have better energy efficiency without sacrificing comfort. One of the main tactics for lowering energy consumption and carbon emissions in already-existing commercial buildings is energy retrofitting. "Providing a machine with a part, or a place with equipment which was not originally present when it was built" is what the Cambridge Dictionary defines as "retrofitting." However, in this context, it refers to any intervention activity that involves modernizing or repurposing the current structure to satisfy an appropriate requirement. Both cases deal with increasing a building's level of sustainability and energy efficiency through renovations. Multiple combinations of applicable energy consumption-reducing measures that can be applied to retrofit a building present a major challenge to decision-makers in energy retrofit. The evaluation of life cycle cost (LCC) and life cycle analysis (LCA) during retrofits present additional difficulties. LCC and LCA are not used in tandem; additionally, selecting the most appropriate retrofitting strategy or set of measures can occasionally be challenging due to the inclusion of unqualified sustainable technology in listings and selections. The current study intends to address the problems by creating a strong decision support system (RDSS) that integrates sustainable criteria, or triple bottom line TBLs (environmental, social, and economic benefits), in the energy retrofit decision-making process. This will lessen the difficulties encountered in making decisions that will lead to successful building appraisals. The predetermined objectives are meant to lead to the goal. Because of various technological alternatives, it may be vital to have a comparison to simplify sustainable technologies (STs) tools using SWOT/multiple criteria in TBL aspects. Providing an assessment method to merge LCA &amp; LCC to balance environmental and economic performances and determine the impact of the building life cycle on the energy retrofit decision process. Address the challenges decision-makers encounter in dealing with changes due to building markets and regulations since legislation and public expectation drive sustainable buildings. To develop and validate a holistic optimum strategic decision model to select the best retrofit alternatives for a particular building which maximizes the sustainability ranking of the building. Initial research focuses on conducting a life-cycle cost analysis of a commercial office car park building in Sydney, New South Wales. The evaluation includes assessing energy performance through retrofit measures to determine long-term benefits. By using life-cycle cost analysis, the study aims to enhance decision-making in energy assessment. To examine energy consumption intensity, lifecycle costing, CO2 emissions, and cost efficiency, data will be collected from non-green buildings and one building's envelope will be simulated using the Energy Plus tool. Experimental measurements will be compared to validate simulated models. The study includes a case study on a 12,000 square meter commercial office building used as a commercial parking facility. Retrofitting activities were initiated on three office rooms, focusing on HVAC, lighting, and equipment improvements, resulting in a 1.9-year payback period, 15% emissions reduction, 25% energy savings, and 23% cost savings. The subsequent phase involves utilizing various methods such as concept mapping, focus groups, interviews, Questionnaire surveys, and statistical analysis (SPSS) to develop a robust decision support system (RDSS) for sustainable energy retrofits. The overall goal is to establish a systematic decision support system to aid decision-makers and policymakers in improving energy efficiency in commercial office buildings by implementing passive technologies. The system will also recommend strategies to enhance financial outcomes through smart building operations and management implementations.</description>

      <title>Climate and Energy Transitions in Times of Environmental Backlash? The European Union &#8216;Green Deal&#8217; From Adoption to Implementation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/jcms.13675</link>
      <description>Pierre Bocquillon, JCMS Journal of Common Market Studies. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401777155

                The inception of the European Union's (EU's) 'Green Deal' &#8211; a flagship project of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen launched to much acclaim in December 2019 &#8211; contrasts with its adoption in the final years of the Commission's term in office in 2023&#8211;2024. In 2019, unprecedented climate protests and mobilisations across Europe and the world &#8211; from the 'Fridays for Future' school strikes to climate marches and to more radical actions by groups like the Extinction Rebellion (XR) &#8211; pushed climate change and the energy transition to the top of the EU's political agenda. In this context, the 2019 European elections saw unprecedented successes for Green Parties across the continent, boosting the Greens/European Free Alliance (EFA) parliamentary group to a record 72 members (Pearson and R&#252;dig, 2020). With the main centre-left and centre-right groups together failing to command a majority in Parliament, the Greens were able to pressure Ursula von der Leyen to commit to ambitious policies. The EU 'Green Deal' stemmed directly from this context marked by 'enabling politicisation' of the climate issue (Dupont et al., 2024). The EU climate law (Regulation EU 2021/1119, 2021), formally adopted in July 2021, committed the block to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and reducing net emissions by 55% by 2030, whilst a large legislative package explicitly called 'Fit for 55' was proposed by the Commission that same month to achieve the headline targets. Although the Green Deal has been developed in times of crisis, the Commission and EU have held steady in their commitments (Eckert, 2021; Von Homeyer et al., 2022). Yet, the finalisation of the legislative proposals aimed at turning lofty goals into action in 2023&#8211;2024 &#8211; before the Commission's end of term and EU Parliament elections &#8211; has taken place in a starkly different context. Energy and cost of living crises, initially triggered by post-COVID-19 supply chain disruptions and dramatically heightened by the war in Ukraine leading to energy supply disruptions and commodity price hikes across Europe, have increasingly fuelled concerns about the costs of climate and energy transitions (Goldthau and Youngs, 2023; Kuzemko et al., 2022). Although energy prices have fallen since the end of 2023, cost of living and energy security issues have remained salient. Politically, this context has been instrumentalised by populist and radical right parties to mobilise against the climate and energy transitions (Yazar and Haarstad, 2023), whilst the centre has also become increasingly cautious, especially the centre right. At the European level, this is most evident for the European People's Party (EPP), which has increasingly contested Green Deal legislation, most notably the Nature Restoration Law (Regulation EU 2024/1991, 2024) (Tosun, 2023). This shift is in part a response to protests and contestations of energy and climate legislation across the continent, notably the highly covered farmer's protests starting in late 2023 and continuing throughout the spring of 2024 (Politico, 2024; Reuters, 2023). The June 2024 European Parliament elections reflect this new context, with a rise of far-right groups, whilst the Greens were the main losers along with the liberals (Hix et al., 2024). Against this background of 'constraining politicisation' of climate policy (Dupont et al., 2024), this article asks whether 2023&#8211;2024 represents a turning point for EU commitments to the climate and energy transitions. As a new European Commission and Parliament set in, it is a good time to assess progress and challenges for the EU 'Green Deal'. Has it been faltering? What are the prospects for its implementation and for renewing the EU's green ambitions? I argue that, overall, the agenda for climate action and energy system decarbonisation has proved remarkably resilient. EU institutions and member states have remained committed to delivering the climate and energy dimensions of the Green Deal agenda by the end of the von der Leyen Commission's term and have mostly delivered. Yet, cost concerns, protests and their political use by right-wing populists also raise questions for implementation, possibly dampening ambitions going forward. This article first reviews the progress of the Green Deal legislation and whether the EU has delivered on its ambitions, focusing in particular on energy and climate change. It then assesses the seemingly waning momentum for climate action and the recent 'green backlash'. Finally, it reflects on the prospects for Green Deal implementation and renewal, drawing insights from past crises and their effects on EU environmental and climate policies. It concludes that, whilst the energy and climate transition agenda is likely to prove resilient, its framing and focus may be changing in the context of domestic politicisation of the climate and energy transition and global geopolitical competition. In its initial communication launching the 'Green Deal', the European Commission (2019) presented a wide-ranging strategy to 'make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050', protect biodiversity, create a circular economy, curb pollution and mobilise finance for the green transition, all whilst boosting the competitiveness of European industry and ensuring a just transition for the affected regions and workers. The implementation of this strategy has led to the proposal and subsequent adoption of a wide range of policy packages and individual laws across different sectors, from climate and energy to agriculture, transport and the environment. Since its launch as a core priority of the 'geopolitical Commission' and over the course of its evolution, the contours of the Green Deal as a political object have remained ill-defined. This is in part because it is a cross-cutting strategy reflecting the multisectoral, complex and evolving nature of the climate crisis, which requires climate policy integration across all areas (Dupont et al., 2024). This is also politically deliberate: to reframe and aggregate new and related initiatives as part of an all-encompassing, purposeful and popular narrative. The EU steamed ahead throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024 to finish off the negotiation and adoption of remaining Green Deal files ahead of the June 2024 EU elections, marking the end of the term of both the ninth legislature of the European Parliament and the first von der Leyen Commission. Uncertainty arose when the Commission Vice President and Green Deal chief, Frans Timmermans, known as a heavyweight skilled negotiator and vocal proponent of the Green Deal, left his post to compete in Dutch elections and lead a left-green alliance (Euractiv, 2023a). He was replaced by Commission Vice President Maro&#353; &#352;ef&#269;ovi&#269; and the new controversial Dutch appointee Wopke Hoekstra, criticised for his past employment at Shell and lacklustre record on climate (Taylor, 2023a). Yet, this did not derail work on finalising the Green Deal, which was successful overall with a majority of files adopted and a few blocked or withdrawn due to delays or intractable divisions.1 Looking specifically at the 'Fit for 55' package, which implements the headline emission reduction targets and energy transition objectives, it was originally composed of 13 legislative proposals, later extended to 19.2 As of July 2024, all proposals but one had been adopted by the co-legislators. Some of the legislation updates and strengthens pre-existing legislation, whilst new policies are also introduced. A significant step was the reform of the flagship EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS), adopted in April 2023, along with a raft of associated laws. It accelerates the reduction of emission allowances for energy-intensive industries and the power sector; progressively phases out free allowances; progressively includes shipping within the ETS; strengthens the rules for aviation emissions by phasing out free allowances for domestic flights and implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) for extra-European flights; and revises the market stability reserve that aims to maintain stable and effective carbon prices. The reform aims to achieve an emission reduction of 62% in covered sectors by 2030, compared to 2005, a reduction slightly higher than initially proposed by the Commission. In addition, a new and distinct ETS is introduced for buildings, road transport and additional sectors &#8211; all considered hard to decarbonise &#8211; that apply to fuel distributors from 2027. A new Social Climate Fund, mostly supplied by revenues from the new ETS, aims to help vulnerable households, small companies and transport users cope with associated costs. This is a recognition of the concrete impacts and justice implications of this new scheme and an attempt at diffusing contestation to avoid a replay of protracted opposition, such as the 'Yellow Vest' protests that rocked France in 2018&#8211;2020 following an increase in fuel taxes. An innovative and internationally controversial piece of legislation is the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which imposes a carbon tax on imports of products in carbon-intensive industries. CBAM is to be progressively phased in from 2026 in line with the phasing out of free allowances within the ETS, aiming to put EU and third-country industries on a level playing field and avoid carbon leakage &#8211; the outsourcing of industrial emissions to jurisdictions with lower emission standards and costs. In sectors not covered by the ETS (road and domestic maritime transport, buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries), emission reductions are defined by the Effort Sharing Regulation. The revision, adopted in March 2023, increases the 2030 EU-wide target from 29% to 40%, compared with 2005, and distributes the effort with binding national targets. Along with this, the revised Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) regulation of March 2023 includes an increased EU-level target of at least 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent net removals of greenhouse gases for 2030, with associated and binding national targets. A new regulation on tracking and reducing methane emissions in the energy sector, adopted in November 2023, aims to implement the Global Methane Pledge signed along with over 100 countries at the UN Climate COP26. It requires the oil, gas and coal industries to measure, report and verify methane emissions and to put in place mitigation measures for leak detection and repair, as well as for closed wells and mines. For transport, a hard-to-decarbonise sector, a number of new laws were passed in addition to ETS provisions. The regulation on CO2 emission standards for cars and vans, updated and finally adopted in March 2023, introduces progressive emissions reduction targets, including a 100% emission reduction target for 2035, which effectively amounts to a complete phase-out of combustion car and van sales. In parallel, and to facilitate the growth of electric vehicles, the regulation on alternative fuel infrastructure finalised that same month mandates the installation of recharging stations for cars and vans every 60 km, as well as hydrogen refuelling stations for cars and lorries in all urban nodes from 2030 onwards. For shipping, a July 2023 agreement on the FuelEU maritime initiative mandates a reduction of greenhouse gas intensity for the energy used on-board ships by up to 80% by 2050, whilst promoting the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Concerning aviation, the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative adopted in October 2023 aims to promote sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) (e.g., advanced biofuels, renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and recycled fuels meeting sustainability and emissions-saving criteria). It sets obligations for fuel suppliers to ensure that aviation fuels contain minimum shares of SAF (from 2025) and synthetic fuels (from 2030), increasing progressively until 2050. The energy sector also saw key proposals updated. The revision of the flagship renewable energy directive, finally adopted in October 2023, sets a binding target of 42.5% renewable energy in EU final energy consumption by 2030 (up from a paltry 32.5%), with an extra 2.5% indicative top-up to reach the 45% supported by the most ambitious member states and European Parliament. The directive does not set binding national renewable energy targets but introduces a mix of binding and non-binding renewable sub-targets in transport, industry, buildings and district heating and cooling, whilst also mandating faster permitting procedures for renewable energy projects. Increased ambitions are in part the results of the REPowerEU plan of 18 May 2022, adopted in the context of the war in Ukraine and aiming at reducing EU dependence on Russian gas (Von Homeyer et al., 2022; Wendler, 2023). It introduced targeted emergency amendments to increase overall ambitions to 45%. As pointed out by Buzog&#225;ny et al. (2023), the revised renewable energy directive also introduces a high level of flexibility for member states regarding the various sub-targets as a condition of its adoption. Ambitions have also been upgraded for energy efficiency. The revised energy efficiency directive, agreed upon in July 2023, sets a target to reduce final EU energy consumption by 11.7% in 2030 compared to 2020 projections. This is less than the 13% proposed under the REPowerEU plan and, in typical fashion, a middle ground between the more ambitious Parliament and the more cautious Council (Kurmayer, 2023). The directive also includes indicative national contributions for member states, a gradual increase of the annual energy savings target and a specific annual energy consumption reduction for the public sector (including the yearly renovation of a set share of public buildings). The energy efficiency directive is complemented by a revision of the energy performance of buildings directive, completed in 2024, which aims for all new buildings to be zero emission by 2030 and for existing buildings to be retrofitted to have zero emissions by 2050, with mandates for solar energy in buildings and rising minimum energy performance standards and renovation targets. Finally, a regulation and a directive adopted in December 2023 aim to facilitate the shift from natural gas to renewable and low-carbon gases by setting common rules for hydrogen infrastructures and markets. Of the 19 proposals associated with the 'Fit for 55' package, only one remains pending. The proposed revision of the Council directive on the taxation of energy products and electricity aims to switch from energy taxation based on volume to taxation based on energy content. Fossil fuels would be taxed at the highest rate and electricity at the lowest. Energy taxation is a sovereign, sensitive matter and the exclusive competence of the member states under the Lisbon Treaty, decided by the Council subject to unanimity, which has proved a perennial challenge. The 2003 directive sets minimum levels of taxation on energy products, fuels and electricity but places energy sources on an equal footing irrespective of their carbon content. Despite agreement that an update is much overdue, a previous attempt started in 2011 failed in the face of member states' opposition, leading the Commission to withdraw the proposal in 2015. Once again, despite the last-ditch efforts from the Belgian Presidency in the winter of 2024, no agreement could be reached, and its adoption has been postponed to the next legislature (Messad, 2024). Overall, then, despite the challenges associated with post-COVID-19 recovery and the war in Ukraine, from energy supply disruptions to high energy prices, the momentum for climate action and energy system decarbonisation has not evaporated, showing remarkable resilience. EU institutions and member states have remained committed to delivering the climate and energy dimensions of the Green Deal agenda during the term of the von der Leyen Commission and have mostly delivered. Indeed, as many have pointed out, the crises have been reframed into 'windows of opportunity' for furthering the Green Deal agenda (Eckert, 2021; Von Homeyer et al., 2022). The COVID-19 NextGenEU recovery programme of &#8364;750 billion and the associated Recovery and Resilience Facility make new funding available in the form of loans and grants. With member states required to spend at least 37% of their National Recovery and Resilience Plans (NRRPs) in support of the green transition, this additional funding has tended to accelerate ongoing policies and projects rather than new initiatives (Bocquillon et al., 2023). Similarly, the EU's response to the war in Ukraine, in particular the REPowerEU plan to reduce dependence on Russia, has mostly accelerated pre-existing Green Deal dynamics rather than initiated a change of course (Wendler, 2023). It has led to a Commission's legislative proposal for an upgrade of the Green Deal's renewable and energy efficiency targets for 2030 to foster homegrown renewables and reduce imports; additional investments of &#8364;210 billion until 2027 to be defined in new REPowerEU chapters added to NRRPs [with the possibility of financing liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure]; and various soft mechanisms to help diversify supplies (e.g., external engagement strategy, establishment of a new voluntary EU Energy Platform to co-ordinate energy purchases and hydrogen strategy). None of this has upended and, in fact, reinforced the Green Deal's agenda. The jury is still out, however, as to the overall effect of the energy crisis in view of national efforts to shore up short-term fossil fuel supplies with new contracts and infrastructure (Goldthau and Youngs, 2023; Kuzemko et al., 2022). As most energy and climate legislation has been adopted, at least in this first phase of an ever-evolving agenda, attention turns towards implementation, which is crucial to effectiveness and legitimacy. Looking at the period covering the Eurozone crisis for insight, when the salience of and appetite for ambitious environment and climate policies receded, several studies tracked environmental policy dismantling and found real but limited instances in the face of institutional resilience (Gravey and Jordan, 2016). They also point out that there is a risk of policy dismantling 'through the back door' in implementation, notably via delegated and implementing acts (Burns and Tobin, 2020). As is evident from the cursory overview above, adopted legislation is ridden with flexibility mechanisms, such as indicative targets, exemptions and optionality, which may be justified in view of national diversity and indeed necessary to reach agreements, but can also make effective implementation challenging. This is clearly the case with the revised renewable energy directive, with its various sub-targets and differentiated options (see Buzog&#225;ny et al., 2023). Various policies also have phase-in periods and start to kick in progressively, with stringency increasing over time, often beyond 2030 (Von Homeyer et al., 2022). For instance, targets for reducing and phasing out combustion cars will increase, reaching 100% in 2035. This is also the case for CBAM, which has only reporting obligations during a phase-in period, with its tax component entering into force in 2026 in parallel with the phasing out of free ETS allowances. The new ETS enters into force from 2027 onwards. These phase-in and phase-out periods create multiple points where legislation starts 'to bite' for stakeholders. Some of the legislation, like the ban on new combustion engine sales in 2035 or the new building standards, directly impacts European citizens. There is, therefore, potential for politicisation and contestation of the implementation process, which policy-makers may be particularly concerned about. Certain pieces of legislation in the 'Fit for 55' package also have extra-territorial effects, most notably CBAM. It has been actively discussed, criticised and challenged in international forums. For instance, India has threatened a legal challenge under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules against a trade barrier considered especially disadvantageous to developing countries (Euractiv, 2023b). The EU's unilateral approach may trigger international tensions, making implementation challenging (Smith et al., 2024). In a context of geopolitical competition over who controls the energy transition, the Green Deal has increasingly taken a new turn towards green industrial policy. In response to the United States's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and as part of its Green Deal Industrial Plan, the Commission proposed in May 2023, and the co-legislators adopted in March 2024, a new Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) establishing a non-binding target of 40% strategic 'net-zero' technologies to be produced within the EU, as well as a European Critical Raw Material Act that sets benchmarks for domestic production of key minerals, all whilst aiming to speed up projects. The goal is to secure and reduce dependence on key raw materials and technologies, from the production and import of critical minerals essential for green technologies to battery and electric vehicle production. This industrial and geopolitical framing is likely to become more prominent in the Green Deal to achieve both economic growth and reduced dependence, but it may also fuel international frictions. The economic crisis of the early 2010s showed that, beyond implementation challenges, economic imperatives and environmental objectives could conflict with each other and dampen EU ambitions (Burns et al., 2020; Skovgaard, 2014). Citizens, stakeholders and governments may become less willing to bear the costs of climate action or more cautious about what they can commit to. Crises also offer an opportunity for those against ambitious action to challenge, mobilise and gain legitimacy. Although the climate and energy dimensions of the Green Deal proved relatively resilient with the finalisation of most proposals, the years 2023&#8211;2024 also saw the emergence of a wave of opposition and protests against green policies, including parts of the Green Deal. These protests were widely covered in European and national media, often presented as a 'green backlash' or 'greenlash' (e.g., Politico, 2024; Reuters, 2023; Tash, 2024). Discontent focused on the costs of green policies in a period of cost-of-living crisis and economic downturn, with businesses denouncing the 'regulatory burden' imposed on them. Protests took place across Europe, the West and East and the North and South. Most prominent and widely covered were the farmers' protests that spread across the EU, from Belgium to Germany, France to Spain and Poland to Romania. Often blocking roads, their demands were diverse but tended to focus on costly regulation, notably as part of the greening of the Common Agricultural Policy and biodiversity protection. These protests led to the Commission scrapping a proposal to halve pesticide use in the EU (Tash, 2024). In the Netherlands, plans to cut nitrogen pollution fuelled discontent and the surprise rise of a new farmers' protest party. The backlash was not only limited to farming and conservation, however, with discontent emerging on other issues directly related to energy and climate, such as the phasing out of oil and gas boilers, which nearly broke the German coalition, or the particularly inflammatory phasing out of combustion cars.3 The backlash has been driven by the right and far right (Yazar and Haarstad, 2023). Radical right populists tend to be inimical to climate ambitions, largely on ideological grounds (Lockwood, 2018), even though there is mixed evidence as to their ability to influence EU policy when in power (Huber et al., 2021). Climate policy has become a 'wedge issue' (Dickson and Hobolt, 2024) for these parties, which have politicised it to split and polarise the electorate and shore up support from their climate sceptic base. At the EU level, the far-right grouping of the European Conservatives and Reformists and Identity and Democracy, as well as the centre-right EPP, which is part of the majority coalition, have challenged the purpose and content of pending legislation. The EPP's principal target was the controversial Nature Restoration Law, which sets a target of restoring at least 20% of the EU's land and sea areas by 2030. Building on farmer protests, it failed to block it but was able to considerably weaken the text (Taylor, 2023b). Governments, in turn, responded to domestic pressure or a perceived change of mood. French President Macron's call for a 'European regulatory pause' in the adoption of new green legislation to protect industries (Messad, 2023), supported by other leaders such as Belgian Prime Minister de Croo, came as a shock. The final phase of the negotiations on several files, from car emissions to the energy performance of buildings, saw rising member-state opposition. Poland even initiated legal proceedings against the EU ban on combustion cars in 2035 (Politico, 2023). This picture needs to be nuanced. First, not all parts of the Green Deal have been equally affected. Opposition has tended to concentrate on agriculture reforms and the conservation of nature. Second, the perceived importance of, and support for climate action remain high across member states, at levels broadly similar to 2019, even though climate may have gone down the pecking order of priorities (Eurobarometer, 2023). Despite disruptions and high energy prices due to the war in Ukraine, a majority of respondents to the 2023 special Eurobarometer survey on climate change considered that the transition to a green economy should be sped up. Similarly, Abou-Chadi et al. (2024), based on a representative survey across three countries, argue that the backlash narrative is overblown and largely confined to the far right, with widespread support for climate action and climate policies, provided costs are mitigated through green industrial policies and offsetting measures. Still, the June 2024 European elections indicate challenges ahead for the Green Deal. The main winners were the far-right parties (European Conservatives and Reformists 78, Patriots for Europe 84 and Europe of Sovereign Nations 25) and the centre right (EPP 188), with the main losers being the Greens (Greens/EFA 53) and the liberals (Renew Europe 77). Compared to 2019, when a key signal was a shift towards pro-environment parties and policies, 2024 heralds a shift towards parties with critical positions towards an ambitious environmental agenda, even if the results were arguably not driven by environmental issues. As Hix et al. (2024) and others have pointed out, the new majority will not unravel already adopted legislation, but it could settle for less ambitious climate policies going forward, given the EPP's increasingly critical stance and the fact that the relatively ambitious bloc of the Socialists &amp; Democrats, the liberals and the Greens no longer commands a majority of seats. In her speech to the European Parliament ahead of the vote on her reappointment, which was eventually successful based on a grand coalition against the far right, Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed her commitment to the bloc's climate objectives, including a yet-to-be-agreed 90% reduction target for 2040, and to further the Green Deal agenda. However, the language suggested a framing focused more on competitiveness and green industrial policy with the promise of a 'Clean Industrial Deal', whilst nature and the environment were only mentioned in general terms (Cagney, 2024). The EU Green Deal illustrates, from its inception to its adoption, the promises and perils &#8211; or inherent tensions &#8211; of the politicisation of climate change (Dupont et al., 2024; Paterson et al., 2022). In 2019, climate movements pushed climate change &#8211; an already well-established and institutionalised policy area &#8211; on top of the EU's political agenda. In this context, the Commission proposed a novel, cross-cutting and relatively ambitious Green Deal, receiving wide support across member states and the political spectrum. In this case, politicisation proved enabling. In contrast, the completion of the Green Deal ahead of EU elections has been marked by a different context, with a section of the impacted stakeholders as well as the radical right and centre right politicising the Green Deal agenda to undermine it &#8211; a form of 'constraining politicisation' (Dupont et al., 2024). The Green Deal has proved relatively resilient to the COVID pandemic and the energy crisis, and implementing legislation has been mostly adopted in 2023 and the first half of 2024 &#8211; at least its energy and climate component. Therefore, it would be hard to undo and unlikely to unravel. Climate and energy policies are well established, benefit from high legitimacy and are deeply institutionalised; in contrast, the biodiversity and farming components of the Green Deal have been subject to deeper challenges. Yet, implementation could prove a challenge for climate and energy, with dismantling through the back door via executive acts; policies that are due to be reviewed and could be weakened; and perhaps most importantly, a lack of ambition and stagnation moving forward. There is, therefore, considerable uncertainty, just as a new cycle of negotiations is opening over the 2040 targets. The Green Deal remains fundamentally a moving political object with blurry boundaries, rather than a 'done deal'. More likely than its faltering, one can expect a change in its framing and focus &#8211; on competitiveness and green industrialisation in particular &#8211; in the context of domestic politicisation of the climate and energy transition and global geopolitical competition.
