                In electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR), indium (In)&#8208;based catalysts with low toxicity and environmental benefits are renowned for their specific high selectivity for formic acid and intrinsic inertia for the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. However, recent studies have reported various products over In&#8208;based catalysts showing comparable or even higher selectivity for carbon monoxide (CO) than for formic acid (HCOOH), puzzling the reaction pathway for CO 2 reduction. This article presents a comprehensive review of recent studies on electrocatalytic CO 2 RR over In&#8208;based catalysts highlighting the formation pathway of specific products. First, the mechanism of electrocatalytic CO 2 RR with the multiple reaction pathways is concluded considering the relationship between reaction intermediates and selectivity. Furthermore, the regulation strategies for multiple product formation are summarized, including crystalline phase engineering, alloying, nanostructuring, and structural modulation of In single atom, where the effect of key intermediates (*COOH, *OOCH, and *OCHO) on product generation is systematically discussed to achieve high selectivity. Finally, the intrinsic regulation mechanisms of these strategies are analyzed and the challenges and opportunities for the development of next&#8208;generation In&#8208;based catalysts are proposed.</description>

                Photocatalysis presents a promising pathway for clean energy generation by leveraging solar energy under environmentally benign conditions with minimal pollutant emissions. However, its widespread application is hindered by low catalytic efficiency, stemming from limited light absorption, rapid recombination of photo-excited electrons, and suboptimal charge carrier potential for target reactions. This review discusses advanced strategies to enhance photocatalytic performance by modulating photocatalytic supports and refining co-catalysts. Techniques such as hydrogenation and extrinsic doping of photocatalytic supports are highlighted for their ability to broaden light absorption and prolong electron lifetimes. Additionally, the strategic design of co-catalysts, including the use of nanoclusters and atomically dispersed catalysts, is emphasized for optimizing charge carrier potential and improving atomic utilization efficiency. This review aims to guide researchers in developing high-performance photocatalysts for clean energy applications, including CO2 reduction and plastic waste photoreforming, thereby contributing to the advancement of sustainable energy technologies.</description>

                To achieve high catalytic activity of artificial photosystems in carbon dioxide reduction or water reduction/oxidation into renewable energy vectors, the use of sacrificial electron do-nors (SEDs) remains mandatory. Despite significant progress in artificial photocatalysis, a detailed understanding of the influence of the SEDs on the reaction mechanism is still lack-ing. We have explored the roles of triethanolamine as SED in the selective CO2 to formic acid photoreduction promoted by various pentamethylcyclopentadienyl rhodium(III)-based porous materials as model catalysts, including polyoxometalate-doped systems. In the pres-ence of anionic polyoxometalates, agglomeration of protonated triethanolamine close to the catalytically active site favours H2 evolution over CO2 reduction, which can be modulated through the degree of confinement imposed by the pores size. Radical trapping experiments and EPR spectroscopy show that triethanolamine-radicals are crucial for a high activity in CO2 reduction. Triethanolamine-radicals act as electron relays in the efficient two-electron activation of the catalyst, regardless whether a homogeneous or a heterogeneous catalyst is used. In contrast, triethylamine-radicals cause deactivation of the one-electron reduced cata-lyst, thus highlighting the effect of different SED-intermediates and underling the im-portance of an appropriate SED.</description>

      <title>Effect of overlapping layout of Fe/TiO2 on CO2 reduction with H2 and H2O</title>

                Fe-doped TiO2 (Fe/TiO2) film photocatalyst was prepared by sol-gel dip-coating, and pulse arc plasma process. The netlike glass fiber was used as a base material for the photocatalyst since it had a porous structure. The CO2 reduction performance with H2 and H2O into CO over the Fe/TiO2 photocatalyst was investigated. In addition, this study investigated overlapping two Fe/TiO2 coated on netlike glass fiber in order to utilize the light more effectively as well as increase the amount of photocatalyst for CO2 reduction. The characterization of prepared Fe/TiO2 film coated on netlike glass fiber was analyzed by SEM, EPMA, TEM, EDX and EELS. Furthermore, the CO2 reduction performance of the Fe/TiO2 film was tested under a Xe lamp with or without ultraviolet (UV) light, respectively. The results show that the CO2 reduction performance peaks under the condition of CO2/H2/H2O=1:1:0.5 in both cases with UV light and without UV light illumination. The highest concentration of CO with the Fe/TiO2 overlapped photocatalyst is 1.2 times of that with the single Fe/TiO2 photocatalyst. On the other hand, results also show the highest molar quantity of CO per weight of photocatalyst for Fe/TiO2 overlapped is almost half of single Fe/TiO2.</description>

      <title>Regulating Organic Modifiers on Metal&#8208;based Catalysts for Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been proved as a promising pathway for valuable chemical production and sustainable carbon cycling. Various regulatory strategies have been explored to boost CO2RR performance. Among these, metal&#8208;based electrocatalytic CO2RR systems regulated by organic modifiers have been shown to play a pivotal role in regulating the complex catalytic processes. Herein, we provide an overview of the recent effective research for regulating the organic modifiers on metal&#8208;based catalyst to enhance CO2RR performance. Two main fundamental mechanisms of enhanced CO2RR with organic modifiers are discussed, including controlling the local microenvironment (local concentration of reactant/intermediate, local pH, local electric field) at the electrode surface and modulating intrinsic catalytic active sites (crystal and electronic structure). Moreover, effective strategies to preserve a stable organic modifier/catalysts interface are also reviewed. Finally, the challenges and prospects faced by organic modifiers regulated metal&#8208;based catalyst in CO2RR are proposed. We hope this review will provide a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the actual impacts of organic modifiers on the development of efficient CO2RR catalysts with favorable activity, selectivity, and stability.</description>

                The utilization of renewable energy for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) represents a significant advancement in green carbon conversion technologies. Single atom catalysts (SACs) featuring a transition metal&#8208;nitride&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;Nx&#8208;C) architecture exhibit catalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 to CO. However, the impact of the morphology of carbon supports, particularly their pore structure, on the electrocatalytic performance of CO2RR warrants further investigation. In this study, we fabricated a series of Ni&#8208;based SACs supported by porous carbon nanofibers through electrospinning and sacrificial template method. We examined variations in microstructure of these porous carbon nanofiber carriers at different pyrolysis temperatures and elucidated their effects on CO2RR catalytic performance. The catalyst obtained at 1000 &#176;C demonstrated efficient electrocatalysis for converting CO2 to CO due to its large specific surface area, abundant hierarchical pore structure, and high content of Ni&#8208;Nx species resulting from both the sacrificial template method and high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. A Faradaic efficiency exceeding 90% was sustained across potentials ranging from &#8722;0.7 V to &#8722;1.3 V (vs. RHE), with a peak efficiency reaching 96.1% at &#8722;1.0 V (vs. RHE). Kinetic analysis indicated that this sample exhibited the highest reaction kinetics alongside minimal charge transfer resistance.</description>

                Halide anion adsorption on transition metals can improve the performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), while the specific reaction mechanisms governing selective CO2RR pathways remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the distinct pathways for gaseous (CO) and liquid products (formate and ethanol) on the well&#8208;defined Ag&#8208;Cu nanostructures with controlled chlorination, respectively. We show that CO2 conversion to CO on Ag/AgCl can be tuned by adjusting the thickness of AgCl layer, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) near 100% over a broad potential range in a 0.5 M KHCO3 using flow cell. In contrast, the optimized Cl&#8208;Ag/Cu system enables the conversion of CO2 into liquid products including formate and ethanol with a total FE nearing 100%, delivering high current density under similar conditions. In situ infrared experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the lateral adsorbate of *OCHO intermediate facilitates the thermodynamics of both the CO pathway on Cl&#8208;Ag(111) and the formate pathway on Cl&#8208;Ag/Cu(111) by reducing Gibbs free energy barriers of each potential&#8208;limit step. This work uncovers the role of chlorination in the tuning of C&#8208;bound or O&#8208;bound intermediates during CO2RR on Ag&#8208;Cu catalysts, determining the reaction pathway under lateral adsorbate effects.</description>

                Photoelectrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to high value-added chemicals is one of the effective means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate the energy crisis. In this study, porous carbon nanorods encapsulating bismuth (Bi) nanoparticles were synthesized using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)-assisted spatial confinement and high-temperature carbonization strategy and then modified on silicon nanowires to construct a Si&#8211;Bi@Cx composite photocathode. The presence of the plasmonic metal Bi enhances the light absorption and improves the selectivity of carbon dioxide reduction products as reactive substances. At &#8722;0.9 V vs RHE, the Si&#8211;Bi@C800 photocathode achieves a faradaic efficiency for formic acid (FEHCOOH) of up to 91.23%, with a production rate of 88.5 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8211;1&#183;cm&#8211;2. Further experimental analysis and in situ infrared spectroscopy results showed that the porous carbon nanorods with strong hydrophobicity not only reduce the contact between the electrode and water and inhibit the occurrence of the hydrogen evolution reaction but also accelerate the mass transfer of CO2 molecules and increase the local CO2 concentration. Simultaneously, Bi nanoparticles promote the formation of the *OCHO intermediate and realize the efficient conversion of CO2 to formic acid. This study lays a foundation for constructing active sites on silicon-based semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Efficiency Improvement and the Carbon-Reduction Effects of Transport Restructuring in China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/ad9e85</link>
      <description>Wenjun Xiao, Dan Wu, Li Liu, Ziye Cheng, Environmental Research Communications. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405311877

                Abstract The growth rate of transportation sector&#8217;s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is rigid, making it difficult to reduce emissions, especially for developing countries. The existing literature has not yet fully investigated the CO2 emissions reduction effect of transportation structural adjustment from the perspective of improving productivity, which is defined by total factor energy efficiency (TFEE) in this study. To close this knowledge gap, we first evaluated the TFEE of the transportation sector as a whole and its sub-sectors in 30 provinces in China from 2013 to 2021 based on the parallel data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and then estimated the energy conservation and emissions reduction potentials brought about by the optimization of the transportation structure based on the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model. The main results show: (1) TFEEs vary greatly across sub-sectors and provinces, with provinces performing differently across sub-sectors. (2) Compared with the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, the structure enhancement (SE) scenario of structural adjustment can cumulatively reduce CO2 emissions by 289.20 Mt by 2030. (3) In the SE scenario, the energy demand will peak in 2026 and the CO2 emissions will peak at 1509.55 MT in 2027. These results indicate that the CO2 reduction from the transportation restructuring (structural effect) can exceed the increase in CO2 emissions following an increase in transportation activity (scale effect) and eventually bring down the total CO2 emissions for the transportation sector, despite the TFEE rankings of the subsector varying across regions. Therefore, policies that value regions with large volumes, a high share of road transport, and well-established infrastructure, can achieve greater potential to reduce carbon emissions.</description>

      <title>Carbon Removal Accounting for a Sustainable Future: Distributing CO2 Flows in Multiservice Systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su162410909</link>
      <description>Gonzalo Rodriguez-Garc&#237;a, Miguel Brand&#227;o, Robert P. Anex, Sustainability. 16(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405317727

                Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) systems are an integral part of sustainable pathways limiting global warming to less than 2.0 &#176;C. When the sole purpose of CDR is capturing and storing atmospheric CO2, carbon registries offer detailed procedures to calculate the carbon removal credits. However, the registries do not address how to distribute CO2 flows when CDR provides additional services. Standardized, transparent rules for distributing CO2 flows among CDR services are required for the formation of efficient private and public carbon markets. The lack of such rules could result in double counting if those reductions are allocated to more than one service, decreasing the trustworthiness of carbon removal credits or deterring the delivery of an additional low-carbon service, thus limiting the economic viability and deployment of CDR. We examine allocation rules in carbon registries and carbon accounting guidelines, including their life cycle assessment (LCA) principles. We evaluate physical (mass-based) and non-physical (economic) allocation methods using a generic CDR system and find both to be unworkable. We then develop a mass balance (MB) approach which can reliably allocate captured and stored carbon (CSC) between carbon removal credits and other services based on the value CO2 removal in those markets. This practical approach to allocation can be used in a transparent way to provide flexibility that would allow CDR services to capture the value of the multiple services they provide and, through this, promote the deployment of these sustainable alternatives.</description>

      <title>An Assessment of the Performance and Emissions of an Otto Power Generator Group Operating with Wet Ethanol at a High Volumetric Compression Ratio</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17236187</link>
      <description>Vin&#237;cius Guerra Moreira, S&#233;rgio de Morais Hanriot, Tales Gon&#231;alves Nazareno, Bruno Eust&#225;quio Pires Ferreira, Rafael Motter Juliatti, Hairton J&#250;nior Jos&#233; da Silveira, Cristiana Maia, Energies. 17(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405186821

                This work presents an experimental study of the performance and emissions of an internal combustion engine operating in the Otto cycle with a high volumetric compression ratio (17:1). The engine was initially fueled with the standard ethanol used in Brazil, with 7% distilled water (E93W07); we then studied the effects of using different ethanol-in-water mixtures, or &#8216;wet ethanol&#8217;, with 17%, 27%, 37%, and 47% distilled water concentrations. The tests were carried out with power loads of 5.0&#8211;25.0 kW at 5.0 kW intervals and with power loads of 27.5&#8211;35.0 kW at 2.5 kW intervals, whether by adding up the loads or by taking them away. The ignition timing was changed to evaluate each load imposed on the engine to avoid knocking. Specific fuel consumption (SFC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), carbon dioxide emissions (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and total hydrocarbon content (THC), as well as the internal pressure in the cylinder and the heat release rate, were measured, and the results are compared. The results show a reduction in CO and NOx and an increase in THC emissions. However, there were no significant changes in CO2 emissions when the distilled water percentage in ethanol increased. Regarding the brake thermal efficiency, it was observed that it remained approximately constant for all blends, with the same load being applied to the engine shaft, reaching a maximum value of 35%. The results obtained confirm the technical feasibility of operating an internal combustion engine in the Otto cycle with a high volumetric compression ratio using ethanol with up to 47% distilled water without significant loss of performance.</description>

                The ocean has absorbed ~one third of the excess atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) released since the Industrial Revolution. When the ocean absorbs excess CO2, a series of chemical reactions occur that result in a reduction in seawater pH, a process called ocean acidification. The excess atmospheric CO2 is also resulting in warmer seawater temperatures. These stressors pose a threat to marine organisms, especially during earlier life stages (i.e., larvae). The larvae of species like the Florida stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) are free swimming, allowing a population to disperse and recruit into new habitats. After release, stone crab larvae undergo vertical swimming excursions in response to abiotic stimuli (gravity, light, pressure) allowing them to control their depth. Typically, newly hatched larvae respond to abiotic cues that would promote a shallower depth distribution, where surface currents can transport them offshore to complete development. As larvae develop offshore, they become less sensitive to certain abiotic stimuli, which promotes a deeper depth distribution that may expose them to variable current speeds, thus influencing the direction of advection (horizontal movement). Environmental stressors like ocean acidification and elevated seawater temperatures may also impact the larvae&#8217;s natural response to these abiotic stimuli throughout ontogeny (development). Changes in their natural swimming behavior due to climate stressors could, therefore, influence the transport and dispersal of the species. This guided-inquiry lesson challenges introductory marine biology and oceanography students to determine how future ocean pH and temperature projections could impact the swimming behavior of Florida stone crab larvae.</description>

      <title>Effect of Infectious Disease Risk Management on Indoor Environmental Quality in Lecture Rooms: Current Performance and Future Considerations</title>

      <description>Adam O&#8217;Donovan, F Delaney, Ta&#239;na Ouvrard, Pierre A. Geoffroy, Paul D. O&#8217;Sullivan, Sustainability. 16(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405184789

                The global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant and accelerated developments in ventilation practises, where the need to ventilate buildings has been put centre stage. Longer-term ventilation approaches are now more likely to utilise hybrid ventilation strategies to address the challenge of ensuring resilient indoor thermal environments that are carbon neutral while also minimising the risk of long-range airborne infectious spread of viral pathogens. In the short term, there are many existing buildings which may not undergo retrofit for some time, and consequently, risk mitigation strategies have been implemented in these buildings by utilising existing systems. This paper will present an indoor environmental quality evaluation of ten university lecture rooms both before, during and after changes in ventilation management behaviour and systems that were accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate a mean reduction in internal carbon dioxide levels of between 46% and 67% when pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 datasets are compared and between 11% and 62% when pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 datasets are compared. Changes in behaviour and systems have reduced the time spent above thresholds conducive to virus growth by between 8% and 54%, depending on the lecture room. Despite this, a &#8220;rebound&#8221; can be observed in many rooms, with CO2 levels appearing to be trending toward pre-pandemic levels. This work indicates the effect of behavioural and system changes on ventilation and the potential risk for virus spread. The results indicate a need to retrofit existing lecture rooms with more advanced natural or mechanical systems to ensure consistent indoor environmental quality.</description>

                Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) can effectively activate inert carbon dioxide molecules into more helpful fuels and chemicals for human life, which is considered to be one of the most potential ways to achieve the goal of carbon neutralization in the future. So far, using electrocatalytic technology to reduce CO 2 molecules into single-carbon products is very mature, but it is still a great challenge to obtain multicarbon products with more practical values. For this reason, it is urgent to design and synthesize electrocatalysts with ultrahigh selectivity, stability, and excellent activity. Crystalline porous materials (such as metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), covalent organic framework (COF), and their corresponding derived porous materials) provide great opportunities for the activation and transformation of CO 2 because of their large specific surface area, high porosity, controllable structure and morphology, and modified framework, making them a promising candidate material for CO 2 RR. This chapter summarizes in detail the latest research progress on porous materials as typical functional porous framework catalysts in the field of CO 2 RR, providing new horizons and ideas for future exploration in this important field.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Challenges and Strategies for Corporate Energy Conservation and Carbon Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.47260/amae/15110</link>
      <description>Cheng-Wen Lee, Mao-Wen Fu, Advances in management and applied economics. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405308952

                Abstract This study aims to investigate the challenges and dilemmas that enterprises face in pursuing energy conservation and carbon reduction. It emphasizes that while promoting carbon reduction not only helps protect the environment and enhances corporate image, but also leads to long-term operational cost savings, numerous hurdles still exist in practice. These challenges include technical constraints, high investment costs, and uncertainties surrounding policies and regulations. Current literature largely focuses on the impact of macro policies on corporate carbon reduction, often neglecting a micro-level analysis of firms' motivations and practices, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises and non-high-emission industries. This study systematically identifies the factors influencing corporate energy conservation and carbon reduction through comprehensive text and policy analysis. The findings suggest that policy formulation should take into account the varying sizes of enterprises, increase oversight of larger companies, offer targeted support for SMEs, and work to bridge the capacity gap among businesses. As countries actively implement emissions reduction policies, companies are becoming more aware of and responsive to the need for lowering carbon emissions; however, sustained efforts are essential to achieve long-term objectives. The study provides several suggestions for governments to develop differentiated policy measures, enhance corporate education and training initiatives, promote the adoption of new technologies, improve regulatory incentive mechanisms, and establish industry-specific emissions reduction roadmaps. At the enterprise level, it is crucial to integrate carbon reduction into long-term strategies and align it with the industry supply chain. Achieving the goal of net-zero carbon emissions will necessitate collaborative efforts from governments, businesses, and society as a whole. JEL classification numbers: H25, I115, J48.

                Abstract Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) utilization technology is of great significance for achieving carbon neutrality, in which the catalytic materials play crucial roles, and among them, single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) are of particular interests. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning are employed to assess the effectiveness of Cu&#8208;, Ag&#8208;, and Ni&#8208;host SAAs as catalysts for electrochemical CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH. The Gibbs free energies of 477 elementary reactions across 35 SAAs involved in CO 2 reduction are calculated, and by utilizing this dataset, a trained gradient boosting regression model is established with an excellent accuracy. Subsequently, the properties of 46 unknown SAAs are predicted, including their pathways, products, potential&#8208;determining steps (PDS), and corresponding Gibbs free energies of the PDS ( G PDS ). Three promising candidates, ZnCu, AuAg and MoNi, stand out due to their lowest G PDS among Cu&#8208;, Ag&#8208; and Ni&#8208; hosted SAAs, respectively.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective cropping pattern optimization and comparative assessment with the food-energy-water nexus</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2166/ws.2024.254</link>
      <description>Volkan Hac&#305;s&#252;leyman, Mehmet &#214;zger, Water Science &amp; Technology Water Supply. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405199172

                ABSTRACT Agriculture is the largest consumer of water, accounting for nearly 70% of global freshwater consumption, and it also uses about 30% of the world's energy. This creates an increasing challenge for the efficient use of water and energy resources while adequately meeting food demand. Therefore, understanding the interrelations between food, energy, and water resources is crucial. In this study, a multi-objective linear programming model was employed to identify alternative scenarios for optimal cropping areas that minimize water use in agriculture and maximize agricultural income. Different weight coefficients were assigned to these objective functions to generate various cropping scenarios. Once the optimal cropping patterns for each scenario were determined, parameters such as water use, energy requirements, agricultural revenue, and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated based on the food-energy-water nexus. The results for each alternative crop pattern scenario were then analyzed. The results indicate that prioritizing the objective of minimizing water use leads to an average reduction of 3.35% in water use, 1.18% in energy demand, and 0.26% in carbon dioxide emissions, while agricultural income increases by an average of 1% compared to the base scenario. Conversely, when maximizing agricultural income is prioritized, there is an average increase of 2.05% in agricultural income.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Green Development of Industrial Parks on the Reduction of Carbon Emissions in Urban Areas&#8212;Empirical Research on Green Industrial Parks in China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2024ef005161</link>

                Abstract China has over 2,500 national and provincial industrial parks, stimulating the economics growth, meanwhile being the primary sources of carbon dioxide emissions and other pollutants. Assessing the mechanisms and impacts of the policies of pilot programs of green industrial parks on urban carbon emissions offers critical insights into the efficacy and application of green and low&#8208;carbon development. This study utilizes a staggered difference&#8208;in&#8208;differences model to examine the impact of green industrial park pilot policies. The results demonstrate that green industrial parks have effectively reduced carbon emissions of the studied counties in terms of total and intensity. The economic scales and the administrative levels of any given city significantly influence the implementation effect of green industrial park policy. In applying the green industrial park policy, reducing the carbon emissions is more pronounced in cities with larger economic scales and higher administrative levels. Environmental regulation policies and green industrial park pilot policies exhibit a certain degree of substitution effect. The green industrial parks drive urban carbon emission reduction through three main channels: enhancing green technologies, optimizing industrial structures, and elevating economic agglomeration levels. Overall, this study provides a new perspective, a methodological reference, and empirical evidence for promoting green and low&#8208;carbon development for industrial parks in the different regions and developing countries.</description>

However, whether and how industrial competitiveness affects carbon emission intensity (CEI) remains unclear. We develop the Environmental Kuznets Curve model (EKC) which introduces the characteristics of carbon dioxide and industrial life cycle. Additionally, we empirically investigate the impact mechanism of industrial competitiveness on CEI based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2008 to 2019. The results show that: (1) Improving industrial competitiveness can significantly reduce CEI, in which outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) has a partial mediating role. (2) regional heterogeneities exist in the carbon mitigating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif"&gt;&lt;span style="layout-grid-mode:line"&gt; effect of the industrial competitiveness, as it is larger and significant in the Northeast and West, but it is not significant in the East and Central. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif"&gt;(3) &lt;span style="layout-grid-mode:line"&gt;The demarcation point between the investment-driven stage and the innovation-driven stage is -0.6993, and the demarcation point between the innovation-driven stage and the wealth-driven stage is -0.2776. &lt;/span&gt;(4) &lt;span style="layout-grid-mode:line"&gt;The carbon reduction effect of the industrial competitiveness is larger and significant in the investment-driven stage and the innovation-driven stage, but it is not significant in the wealth-driven stage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif"&gt;&lt;span style="layout-grid-mode:line"&gt; Accordingly, for countries in the world, improving industrial competitiveness and then realizing industrial upgrading is an effective way to reduce carbon emission intensity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Metagenomic analysis of compositions and metabolic potential of microbial communities in production water from CO2-and water- flooded petroleum reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26789/aeb.2024.02.006</link>
      <description>Lei Zhou, Gui-Na Qi, Yi-Fan Liu, Jin&#8208;Feng Liu, Shi&#8208;Zhong Yang, Ji&#8208;Dong Gu, Bo&#8208;Zhong Mu, Applied Environmental Biotechnology. 9(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405335938

                CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) is one of the common and effective ways for carbon capture, utilization and storage(CCUS) in China. The injection of CO2 into petroleum reservoirs may influence subsurface environments and further affect microorganisms in oil reservoirs. However, the current knowledge about the impact of CO2 flooding operation on microbial communities and their metabolic functions in oil reservoirs is still limited. In this study, the compositions and metabolic potential of microbial communities in production water from CO2-and water-flooded oil reservoirs in Jilin oilfield were investigated by using a metagenomic approach. Comparative analyses indicated that the microbial community compositions in CO2-flooded oil reservoir samples (GQ43 and GH46) were significantly different from those in water-flooded ones (WQ21 and WH71), with lower microbial diversity. The difference analysis (p&lt;0.05) showed that Pseudomonas, Stutzerimonas, Marinobacterium,Pseudomonadaceae, Methanosarcina and Archaeoglobus were dominant in the former, while Azonexus, Sulfurospirillum, Candidatus Woesearchaeota, Candidatus Methanofastidiosa and Nanoarchaeota predominated in the latter. According to the high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) obtained, some members identified in the CO2-flooded oil reservoir samples might be involved in aerobic alkane biodegradation (Stutzerimonas and Hyphomonas), activated hydrocarbon utilization (Archaeoglobus and Magnetospirillum), fatty acid degradation (Stutzerimonas and Halomonas), fermentative metabolism (Stutzerimonas, Acidaminobacter, Fusibacter, Magnetospirillum, Shewanella, Halodesulfovibrio, Pseudodesulfovibrio and Halomonas), carbon fixation (Methanosarcina and Halodesulfovibrio)and syntrophic methanogenesis (Methanosarcina), simultaneously accompanied by dissimilatory sulfate reduction, thiosulfate reduction and denitrification. Whereas, a series of MAGs recovered from the water-flooded oil reservoir samples might be responsible for fumarate addition of aromatic hydrocarbons, activated hydrocarbon utilization, acetogenesis, reductive citrate cycle, dissimilatory nitrate reduction and sulfur metabolism (dissimilatory sulfate reduction, thiosulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation). These results contribute a broad and deep understanding of microbial communities and their roles in petroleum reservoirs especially affected by CO2 flooding operation, and provide the basic biological information for CCUS.</description>

                Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases cause the atmosphere to get warmer. The ocean absorbs most of the heat and much of the CO2. This raises the temperature of the water, which can cause glaciers and ice sheets to melt, sea level to rise, coral reefs to bleach, fish to migrate to colder waters, and sea turtle sex ratio become skewed toward females. The CO2 added to the water causes its pH to get lower, or more acidic, which has its own negative effects on marine biota, especially shell formation in mollusks. These changes can have drastic economic effects as well as environmental ones. Reductions in fossil fuel use are essential to combat this global problem.</description>

      <title>Enhancing environmental conservation through guided tour buses: Insights from Taijiang National Park</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2305/cdco4840</link>
      <description>Wei-Chia Su, PARKS. 30(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405315117

                High visitor numbers in protected areas can create traffic problems that impact on the environmental protection. In Taijiang National Park, a tour bus project 'Taijiang Fun Tour' was introduced to mitigate various environmental problems caused by private cars. This study evaluates the project's environmental benefits, and those of the various bus routes in the park, in reducing CO2 emissions. The Mangrove route only achieved a CO2 reduction in 2023, likely due to post-COVID-19 tourism recovery. In contrast, the Black-faced Spoonbill route consistently showed reductions in CO2 emissions, attributed to higher per trip passenger numbers replacing more private cars, better road conditions, and longer distances between attractions, that enabled higher bus speeds and lower CO2 emissions per unit time. While it is unsurprising that CO2 reduction is significantly influenced by passenger numbers and bus speeds, the results of this study could be used by TJNP to enhance the benefits from bus use. Starting in 2024, TJNP will optimise routes and implement additional measures to encourage low-carbon transportation.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to valuable fuels and chemical feedstock is a sustainable strategy to lower the anthropogenic CO 2 concentration, thereby dynamising the carbon cycle in the environment. CH 3 OH on the other hand is undoubtedly the most desirable C 1 product of CO 2 RR. However, selective electroreduction of CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;CH 3 OH is very challenging and only limited catalysts are reported in literature. Pyrolyzing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to generate carbon matrix impregnated with metal nanoparticles, heralds exciting electrocatalytic properties. This study unveiled the morphological evolution of a mixed&#8208;ligand Ni&#8208;MOF (Ni&#8208;OBBA&#8208;Bpy) during pyrolysis, to generate Ni nanoparticles anchored 0D porous hollow carbon superstructures (Pyr&#8208;CP&#8208;800 and Pyr&#8208;CP&#8208;600). This unique morphology invokes high specific surface area and surface roughness to the materials, which synergistically facilitates the selective electroreduction of CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;CH 3 OH. In comparison to most of the previously reported Ni electrocatalysts that mainly produced CO, Pyr&#8208;CP&#8208;800 selectively yielded CH 3 OH with Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 32.46% at &#8722;0.60 V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) in 1.0 M KOH solution, which is highest among other reported Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts in the literature, to best of our knowledge. Additionally, insights from density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Ni (111) plane to be the active site toward the electrochemical.

      <title>Thermal Protection Analysis of Hypersonic Reentry Nose Cone with Multi-Row Disk Spike Using Lateral Single/Multi Jets: A Computational Investigation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4067366</link>
      <description>Hanting Gao, Dan Zhu, Journal of Fluids Engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405141836

                Abstract This research examines the efficacy of employing lateral multi jets to decrease thermal effects on the blunt body featuring a multi-row disk spike, which holds significant importance in the design of high-speed vehicles. The main novelty of the model is the combination of the spike with Multiple row disk along with the injection of the coolant jet. The study thoroughly analyzes the cooling mechanism of lateral jets and assesses the influence of coolant jet positioning on heat reduction of the nose and mechanical spike. This study employed RANS equations with SST turbulence model for the simulation of the high-speed flow around the nose cone with Multi-Row Disk Spike. A comparison is made between the effectiveness of CO2 and helium jets, both as single and multiple injectors. The results display that a single CO2 jet released near the tip of the spike is the most effective, and placing the lateral coolant injector away from the main body effectively manages aerodynamic heating. Additionally, the research compares the heat load reduction achieved by triple lateral jets and concludes that the CO2 jet is the most efficient option for thermal protection of the main body. The role of the spike in reduction of the heat load is reduced 20% when CO2 jet is released from all lateral injectors.</description>

                Introduction. Additive manufacturing is a technology that enables three-dimensional (3D) components to be printed layer by layer according to digital models. Completely different from traditional manufacturing methods such as casting, forging, and machining, additive manufacturing is a near net shape manufacturing process that can greatly enhance design freedom and reduce manufacturing runtime. The material processing challenges in Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) are related to achieving performance metrics related to geometric, physical, and material properties. Tight tolerances and stringent surface integrity requirements cannot be achieved by utilizing stand-alone AM technologies. Therefore, WAAM parts typically require some post-processing to meet requirements related to surface finish, dimensional tolerances and mechanical properties. It is therefore not surprising that the integration of AM with post-processing technologies into single and multi-setup machining solutions, commonly referred to as hybrid AM, has become a very attractive proposition for industry. The purpose of the work is to evaluate the quality and mechanical properties of the resulting metal layers of mild steel by WAAM method using additional mechanical and ultrasonic processing. Research Methods. To conduct the experiments, a set of welding equipment was used &#8212; a single-phase inverter device KEMPPI Kempomat 1701, designed for welding with wire in shielding gases. A mixture of argon and carbon dioxide (80 % argon and 20 % CO2) was used as a shielding gas. SV-08G2S (0.8 C-2 Mg-Si) wire was used as the surfacing material. A plate made of steel St3 with overall dimensions 150&#215;100&#215;5 mm was used as a base for surfacing. The surface of the plate before surfacing was thoroughly cleaned from the layer of oxides, oil, rust and other contaminants. For this purpose mechanical cleaning of the surface was used with BOSCH abrasive wheel with a diameter of 125 mm diameter and a grit size of 120. Before surfacing the surface of the product was degreased with white spirit. The gas flow rate was set at 8 dm3/min. To select the optimal wire feed rate and volt-ampere characteristic, surfacing was performed at each adjustment step of wire feed rate, and voltage. Mechanical statistical tensile tests, chemical composition analysis and metallographic studies were also performed. Results and Discussion. Gas porosity is a typical defect that occurs during the WAAM process and should be eliminated because it adversely affects the mechanical properties. Initially, gas porosity leads to a reduction in the mechanical strength of the part due to damage from microcrack formation. In addition, it often causes the surfaced layer to have worse fatigue properties due to the spatial distribution of different shape and size structures. In our experiments we found that a wire feed speed range of 5&#8211;6 m/min is optimal. Increasing the flow rate of shielding gas in the range of 8&#8211;14 l/min allows reducing porosity in the surfaced metal to almost zero. The mechanical properties of the surfaced beads show that the average value of yield strength after machining is higher than that of unprocessed specimens. The data obtained from these experiments are in good agreement with those reported in the literature. The presented results can be used in real WAAM technological processes.</description>

      <title>Research on Industrial CO2 Emission Intensity and Its Driving Mechanism Under China&#8217;s Dual Carbon Target</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su162310785</link>
      <description>Jinfang Sun, Wenkai Li, Kaixiang Zhu, Mengqi Zhang, Haihao Yu, Xiaoyu Wang, Guodong Liu, Sustainability. 16(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405190935

                As global climate change becomes increasingly severe, industrial CO2 emissions have received increasing attention, but the impact factors and driving mechanisms of industrial CO2 emission intensity remain unclear. Based on panel data from 2010 to 2021 in Shandong Province, a key economic region in eastern China, the industrial CO2 emission intensity under China&#8217;s dual carbon target was analyzed using multivariate ordination methods. The results showed that (1) total CO2 emissions from industry are increasing annually, with an average growth rate of 3.74%, and electricity, coal, and coke are the primary sources of CO2 emissions. (2) Total CO2 emissions originated primarily from the heavy manufacturing, energy production, and high energy intensity industry categories, and the CO2 emission intensity of different types of energy increased by 21.24% from 2010 to 2021. (3) CO2 emission intensity is significantly positively correlated with the proportion of high energy intensive industry, energy consumption intensity, and investment intensity and significantly negatively correlated with gross industrial output. In addition, the effects of different types of energy on industrial CO2 emission intensity varied, and coal, coke, electricity, and diesel oil were significantly positively correlated with CO2 emission intensity. Therefore, to reduce the CO2 emission intensity of the industrial sector in the future and to achieve China&#8217;s dual carbon target, it is necessary to adjust and optimize the industrial and energy structure, strengthen technological progress and innovation, improve energy utilization efficiency, improve and implement relevant policies for industrial carbon reduction, and then ensure the sustainable development of the economy, society, and environment.</description>

                ABSTRACT For ensuring the economic feasibility of the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), which can be used to reduce the catalyst load and increase the catalytic activity of CO 2 RR by using carrier materials. Here, we report the systematic alteration of metal chloride on bipyridine groups in MOF&#8208;253(Al) using modified metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors and the introduction of Ag nanoparticles to prepare catalysts Ag@M&#8208;N/Al&#8208;O (M = Co, Ni, Zn, Cu). EDS spectra showed the uniform dispersion of Ag nanoparticles. In addition, the chemical structure of the catalyst was analyzed by XPS and PXRD, which proved the existence of M&#8208;N and Al&#8208;O bonds. The interaction with Ag nanoparticles leads to electron density reconstruction, and the stable *COOH intermediates with electron delocalization enhanced by polymetallic electron configuration modulation are conducive to CO production. The results show that Ag@Co&#8208;N/Al&#8208;O can achieve 85.6% FE for CO and has good stability within 12 h. This work provides a new idea for CO 2 RR material design using MOFs as a precursor catalyst.</description>

      <title>Physiological and Biochemical Responses of Pseudocereals with C3 and C4 Photosynthetic Metabolism in an Environment with Elevated CO2</title>

                The present work aimed to investigate the effect of increasing CO2 concentration on the growth, productivity, grain quality, and biochemical changes in quinoa and amaranth plants. An experiment was conducted in open chambers (OTCs) to evaluate the responses of these species to different levels of CO2 {a[CO2] = 400 &#177; 50 &#956;mol mol&#8722;1 CO2 for ambient CO2 concentration, e[CO2] = 700 &#177; 50 &#956;mol mol&#8722;1 CO2 for the elevated CO2 concentration}. Growth parameters and photosynthetic pigments reflected changes in gas exchange, saccharolytic enzymes, and carbohydrate metabolism when plants were grown under e[CO2]. Furthermore, both species maintained most of the parameters related to gas exchange, demonstrating that the antioxidant system was efficient in supporting the primary metabolism of plants under e[CO2] conditions. Both species were taller and had longer roots and a greater dry weight of roots and shoots when under e[CO2]. On the other hand, the panicle was shorter under the same situation, indicating that the plants invested energy, nutrients, and all mechanisms in their growth to mitigate stress in expense of yield. This led to a reduction on panicle size and, ultimately, reducing quinoa grain yield. Although e[CO2] altered the plant&#8217;s metabolic parameters for amaranth, the plants managed to maintain their development without affecting grain yield. Protein levels in grains were reduced in both species under e[CO2] in the average of two harvests. Therefore, for amaranth, the increase in CO2 mainly contributes to lowering the protein content of the grains. As for quinoa, its yield performance is also affected, in addition to its protein content. These findings provide new insights into how plants C3 (amaranth) and C4 (quinoa) respond to e[CO2], significantly increasing photosynthesis and its growth but ultimately reducing yield for quinoa and protein content in both species. This result ultimately underscore the critical need to breed plants that can adapt to e[CO2] as means to mitigate its negative effects and to ensure sustainable and nutritious crop production in future environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Irrigation Mist and CO2 vs. Direct CO2 Blower in On-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Anastomosis: Efficacy, Efficiency, and Fibrillation upon De-Clamping and Micro-Embolic Gas Activity Incidence</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina60122035</link>
      <description>Ignazio Condello, Giuseppe Speziale, Flavio Fiore, Giuseppe Nasso, Medicina. 60(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405239100

                Background and Objectives: In coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on pump, achieving optimal visualization is critical for surgical precision and safety. The use of blowers to clear the CABG anastomosis poses risks, including the formation of micro-embolic gas bubbles, which can be insidious and increase the risk of cerebral or myocardial complications. This retrospective study compares the effectiveness of the use of irrigation mist and CO2 versus a direct CO2 blower without irrigation in terms of visualization, postoperative fibrillation, and micro-embolic gas activity. Materials and Methods: The study involved 40 patients who underwent on-pump CABG, with 20 patients assigned to the irrigation mist and CO2 group (ClearView&#8482;) and 20 to the direct CO2 blower group. Primary outcomes included the quality of intraoperative visualization, the incidence of fibrillation at aortic de-clamping, and the presence of micro-embolic gas activity detected via transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the cardiac chambers. Results: Patients in the irrigation mist and CO2 group experienced superior visualization and reduced tissue desiccation. Fibrillation at the time of aortic de-clamping occurred in two patients (10%) using the irrigation mist and CO2, compared to eight patients (40%) using the direct CO2 blower. Additionally, TEE monitoring revealed lower levels of micro-embolic gas activity in the irrigation mist and CO2 group, indicating a potential reduction in gas embolization risk. Conclusions: The irrigation mist and CO2 system not only provides enhanced visualization during CABG but also significantly reduces the incidence of fibrillation during aortic de-clamping and micro-embolic gas activity. These findings suggest improved patient safety and outcomes, highlighting the irrigation mist and CO2 system as a potentially safer alternative to direct CO2 blowing in the context of myocardial revascularization.</description>

      <title>Coupling x-ray computed tomography and gray-level co-occurrence matrix to assess the evolution of microstructural damage in coal treated with supercritical CO2 fluid</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0246083</link>
      <description>Peng Luo, Zhenyu Zhang, Zihao Kan, Kangsheng Xue, Zhenjian Liu, Physics of Fluids. 36(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405280685

                The reliability of segmentation of x-ray computed tomography (CT) images based on user-selected thresholds is important for analyzing supercritical CO2 (ScCO2)-water-induced microstructural damage in coal. In this study, a novel approach is introduced by integrating the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) method with CT to analyze the evolution of microstructural damage in coal treated by ScCO2-water. The factors influencing GLCM calculation are also examined. GLCM heat maps and statistics were employed to visualize and quantitatively analyze the evolution of microstructural damage. The results show that the application of image grayscale registration and noise reduction to GLCM statistics did not produce directional bias, with noise reduction having a more significant impact. The pixel pairings depicted in GLCM heat maps provide insights into the spatial distribution of pore-fracture (in the low-density quadrant) and mineral components (in the high-density quadrant) within CT images, elucidating the evolution of micro-damage in coal samples. After the ScCO2-water treatment, a conspicuous rise in pixel pair counts within the low-density quadrant can be observed, accompanied by significant dissolution of the highest-density minerals, leading to a maximal reduction in pixel values within the high-density quadrant. Moreover, GLCM statistics show that the maximum damage location after ScCO2-water treatment does not completely match the initial coal. An accurate description of the evolution of GLCM statistics in the structural damage behavior induced by CO2 injection into deep coal-rock reservoirs is crucial, suggesting that these GLCM statistics have the potential to predict structural damage and reservoir instability during the geological sequestration of CO2.</description>

                This paper presents a comprehensive holistic methodology implemented for sustainable lighting systems in educational institutions. The proposed methodology is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly with SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), and it follows international standards. The six-step process includes viability analysis, project design simulation using DIALux 4.13 software, the installation of LED lighting systems, and the redesign of some electrical circuits, followed by an analysis of return on investment and the monitorization of CO2 and energy consumption. The proposed methodology results in significant return on investment (ROI), primarily achieved through energy savings and reduced maintenance costs. The implementation of LED tubes, combined with occupancy and natural light sensors, leads to a 66% reduction in energy consumption and a reduction of 15.63 tons (metric tons) of CO2 annually, translating into a quick payback period of approximately 2.36 years. Additionally, the system includes Long-Term Monitoring, which ensures that energy consumption and lighting levels are continuously tracked.</description>

                Photochemical transformation represents an attractive pathway for the conversion of earth-abundant resources, such as H2O, CO2, O2, and N2, into valuable chemicals by utilizing sunlight as an energy source. Recently, two-dimensional conjugated metal-organic frameworks (2D c-MOFs) have emerged as the focal points in the field of photo-to-chemical conversion due to their advantages in light harvesting, electrical conductivity, mass transport, tunable electronic and porous structures, as well as abundant active sites. In this review, we highlight various physical and chemical features of 2D c-MOFs that can contribute to enhanced photo-induced exciton generation, charge transport, proton migration and redox catalysis. Then, the existing strategies to integrate suitable light absorbers and/or co-catalysts onto 2D c-MOFs for photochemical transformations (with a particular focus on H2 evolution, CO2 reduction and O2 reduction) have been discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of using 2D c-MOFs in other photochemical applications (e.g., N2 fixation, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation) are assessed.</description>

                Atomically precise gold nanoclusters have shown great promise as model elctrocatalysts in pivotal electrocatalytic processes such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Although the influence of ligands on the electronic properties of these nanoclusters are well acknowledged, the ligand effects on their electrocatalytic performances have been rarely explored. Herein, using [Au25(SR)18]- nanocluster as the prototype model, we demonstrated the importance of ligand hydrophilicity versus hydrophobicity in modulating the interface dynamics and electrocatalytic performance. Our first-principle computations revealed that Au25 protected by hydrophilic -SCH2COOH ligands dictates faster kinetics in stripping the thiolate ligand and exhibits better HER activity due to enhanced proton transfer facilitated by boosted interface hydrogen bonding. Conversely, Au25 protected by hydrophobic -SCH2CH3 ligands demonstrates enhanced CO2RR performance by minimizing water interference to stabilize the key *COOH intermediate and lower the barrier for CO formation. Experimental validation using synthesized [Au25(MPA)18]- (MPA=Mercaptopropionic acid) and [Au25(SC6H13)18]- confirms these findings, where [Au25(MPA)18]- exhibits better activity and stability in HER, while [Au25(SC6H13)18]- achieves higher Faradaic efficiency and current density in CO2RR. The mechanistic insights in this study provide valuable guidance for the rational design of surface microenvironment in efficient nanocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.</description>

      <title>Is it worth it to go green? ESG disclosure, carbon emissions and firm financial performance in emerging markets</title>

                Purpose This study aims to explore how environmental investments impact the firm financial outcomes in emerging markets using a sample of 4,081 firms across 25 emerging countries from different regions from 2010&#8211;2022. Design/methodology/approach Fixed effect regressions with robust standard errors for unbalanced panel data are used to investigate the impact of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosure scores and carbon emissions intensity on firm profitability. The authors used simultaneous quantile regressions with bootstrapped standard errors to allow for estimating parameters of different quantiles of superior and inferior financial performers. Non-linear regressions are used to test for curvilinear relationships. Two-stage least squares regressions are used to mitigate concerns of endogeneity. Findings The results reveal that firms with less emissions of carbon dioxide report high profitability, however, firms with high ESG disclosure scores do not achieve superior performance.

                Impending and increasingly stringent emissions regulations regarding natural gas compressor engines drive the research behind blending hydrogen with natural gas to make these internal combustion engines and their combustion process more efficient. This investigation seeks to answer two fundamental questions: will blending hydrogen with natural gas reduce overall engine fuel consumption, and can greenhouse gas emissions be reduced by blending hydrogen with natural gas? A 4-cylinder Cooper&#8211;Bessemer GMV engine, housed at Colorado State University&#8217;s Powerhouse facility, was investigated for hydrogen&#8211;natural gas blending using multiple engine configurations. A lean-burn engine uses an active pre-combustion chamber as its ignition source, along with electronically activated high pressure fuel injection in the main combustion chamber. One configuration tested utilized high-pressure fuel injection and blending in hydrogen, up to 40% by volume, in both the main chamber and pre-combustion chamber fuel supplies. A second configuration, where the main combustion chamber fuel was solely natural gas and only the pre-combustion chamber received hydrogen-blended natural gas, was also tested. The final configuration to be tested used low pressure fuel injection with mechanically actuated valves in the main chamber with a traditional spark plug ignition source. All engine configurations saw reductions in methane emissions of up to 30% using blended natural gas and hydrogen. Carbon dioxide emissions were also shown to be reduced for the two configurations. A reduction in brake-specific fuel consumption of up to 2% was also seen for two configurations. These results support the hypothesis that blending hydrogen into natural gas can reduce engine total fuel consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</description>

      <title>ML-Enabled Solar PV Electricity Generation Projection for a Large Academic Campus to Reduce Onsite CO2 Emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17236188</link>

                Mitigating CO2 emissions is essential to reduce climate change and its adverse effects on ecosystems. Photovoltaic electricity is 30 times less carbon-intensive than coal-based electricity, making solar PV an attractive option in reducing electricity demand from fossil-fuel-based sources. This study looks into utilizing solar PV electricity production on a large university campus in an effort to reduce CO2 emissions. The study involved investigating 153 buildings on the campus, spanning nine years of data, from 2015 to 2023. The study comprised four key phases. In the first phase, PVWatts gathered data to predict PV-generated energy. This was the foundation for Phase II, where a novel tree-based ensemble learning model was developed to predict monthly PV-generated electricity. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) technique was incorporated into the proposed framework to enhance model explainability. Phase III involved calculating historical CO2 emissions based on past energy consumption data, providing a baseline for comparison. A meta-learning algorithm was implemented in Phase IV to project future CO2 emissions post-solar PV installation. This comparison estimated a potential emissions reduction and assessed the university&#8217;s progress toward its net-zero emissions goals. The study&#8217;s findings suggest that solar PV implementation could reduce the campus&#8217;s CO2 footprint by approximately 18% for the studied cluster of buildings, supporting sustainability and cleaner energy use on the campus.</description>

                This study demonstrates the benefits of comprehensive school building (SB) energy efficiency (EE) improvements through building envelope renovations, lighting upgrades, and changes to cleaner heat sources. The parametric study in the building energy simulation software was used to check the application of various interventions on the energy consumption of existing SBs while reducing CO2 emissions with the most profitable return on investment (ROI). The energy savings from window replacements did not correspond with expectations. However, other measures such as the wall, roof insulation, and lighting modernization improved EE by up to 152 kWh/m2 and 41 kg/m2 CO2/m2 annually. The study also points to a significant trade-off between district heating (which reduces CO2 but has a slower ROI) and other heating solutions. The results suggest that climate-specific insulation thickness and glazing type needs are required, and optimal insulation strategies are shown to improve EE by 48&#8211;56% and CO2 reductions of 45&#8211;56%. Lighting replacement and biogas boiler use were both impactful. The findings support the importance of sustainable practices, which should stimulate educational awareness and environmental responsibility. This research presents actionable insights for EE and sustainable development from within educational facilities.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Soot Dynamics in C3H8 Oxy-Combustion with CO2 and H2O</title>

                Oxygen-enriched combustion is increasingly recognized as a viable approach for clean energy production and carbon capture, offering substantial benefits for boosting combustion efficiency and mitigating pollutant emissions, which makes it widely adopted in various industrial applications. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), predominantly consisting of propane (C3H8), is commonly utilized in numerous combustion systems, yet its emissions of soot particulates have raised considerable environmental concerns. This study delves into the combustion dynamics and soot formation behavior of propane, the principal component of LPG, under oxy-fuel combustion conditions, with the inclusion of H2O and CO2, utilizing both experimental techniques and numerical simulations. The results reveal that CO2 and H2O suppress soot formation through distinct mechanisms. CO2 decreases soot nucleation and surface growth by lowering flame temperature and H atom concentration, but it minimally enhances soot oxidation. H2O significantly reduces soot formation by chemically increasing OH radical concentration, thereby enhancing soot oxidation. A detailed decoupling analysis further shows that CO2&#8217;s influence is predominantly thermal and chemical, resulting in lower OH levels and an elongated flame shape. In contrast, H2O&#8217;s substantial thermal and chemical effects decrease flame height and promote soot reduction. These insights advance the understanding of soot formation control in oxy-fuel combustion, offering strategies to optimize combustion efficiency and minimize environmental impact.</description>

      <title>Comparative Assessments of At-Sea and Inland Low- and Medium-Pressure CO2 Transport</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17236171</link>
      <description>Ingeborg Treu R&#248;e, Pauline Oeuvray, Marco Mazzotti, Simon Roussanaly, Energies. 17(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405186651

                Developing cost-efficient systems for transporting CO2 is key to accelerating the deployment of carbon capture and storage. The present work explores the impact of reducing the pressure of tank-based inland and at-sea transport on their techno-economic performance. The study uses established techno-economic models for CO2 transport, adjusted with the most up-to-date knowledge on the costs of low-pressure containment and transport. In particular, the impact of cargo tank material and design on the transport costs show that low-pressure cargo tank systems can be 50% less expensive than medium-pressure systems if materials with similar price and strength can be used. This results in reductions in transport costs as high as 30% for long distances. This is partly driven by the currently suggested size limitation on medium-pressure shipping that limits its economies of scale. If this limitation is alleviated, the cost advantage of low-pressure shipping compared to medium-pressure is more limited (10&#8211;20%) although it remains advantageous. The same scaling effects on capacity were not found for truck and barge inland transport, thus yielding 1&#8211;10% cost reductions of low-pressure transport relative to medium-pressure transport. These results imply that future systems may combine medium-pressure inland and low-pressure at-sea transport and that efficient solutions connecting the two must be investigated.</description>

                Abstract Corporate transition plans (TPs) are increasingly seen as crucial components of assessing the compatibility and credibility of corporate commitments to meet climate targets. However, robust and transparent methods to assess the credibility of disclosed TPs are lacking. Here we propose a novel open-source methodology for assessing the credibility of corporate TPs based on asset-level data to estimate CO2 emission trajectories: the production asset-based planning approach (APA). We test this approach on a sample of ten electric utilities and ten steel companies and find that only three of the companies&#8217; stated TPs are compatible with Paris-aligned benchmarks. We also find that 12% and 42% of existing carbon-intensive assets operated by electric utility and steel companies, respectively, will require reinvestment before 2030, posing significant carbon lock-in risk. Applying this method will ensure that TPs can be assessed in a robust manner and help drive CO2 emission reductions towards achieving the Paris climate target.</description>

      <title>LITERATURE REVIEW ON CO-FIRING OF SUB BITUMINOUS COAL AND BIOMASS FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION MITIGATION</title>

                The overuse of fossil fuels has led to global warming and air pollution due to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2. The toxic effects of coal combustion can be reduced by mixing coal with biomass, which is called the co-firing method. This study aims to analyze the use of co-firing using various types of biomass based on previous studies. The results show that different biomass blending ratios affect the emission reduction significantly. Mixing palm kernel shell biomass at a ratio of 10% biomass and 90% coal reduced emissions by 20%, while mixing mesua ferrea tree biomass and sawdust at a ratio of 75% coal and 25% biomass reduced emissions by 45%. The use of empty fruit bunch biomass at a ratio of 30% biomass and 70% coal can reduce CO2 emissions by 72.14%. Overall, co-firing proved effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and accelerating the transition to renewable energy, although its effectiveness depends on the type of biomass and the blending ratio.</description>

      <title>Effects of Flow and Geomechanics Coupling in Faulted Reservoirs for CO2 Storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/220000-pa</link>
      <description>Andrea C. Ferrari, Stefano Nardean, Silvia Monaco, Timur Garipov, Stefano Mantica, A. Cominelli, SPE Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405274510

                Summary Accurately reproducing the coupling of fluid flow in porous media and rock mechanics is crucial for the modeling of CO2 geological storage to properly evaluate and prevent the risk of inducing fault instability during injection operations. As an alternative to using monolithic flow/mechanical suites, the process can be modeled by linking individual codes, that is i, a reservoir simulator for flow and a geomechanical package to account for fluid-induced stress change, which tackle the two problems sequentially. We developed a flexible numerical framework from which different coupling logics can be selected (i.e., one-way coupling, two-way iterative coupling, and two-way explicit coupling), which are characterized by different levels of accuracy and computational costs. A multirate, two-way coupling algorithm, which allows the flow and mechanical simulators to exchange information periodically rather than at every timestep, is also available to reduce the computational cost of two-way coupled simulations. In this work, we use this coupling infrastructure to perform numerical experiments aimed at defining whether sequential iterative coupling is strictly needed or not, and which less expensive logic can be used to attain a similar solution accuracy. First, a synthetic test case is used to illustrate the onset of fault instability during CO2 injection operations for different sets of coupling parameters (type and frequency), rock properties, and fault permeability. It is thus possible to evaluate, for a reasonable range of coupling strength, which depends on fluids and rock properties, the optimal level of coupling. Results are strongly influenced by the coupling strength, and two-way iterative coupling should be selected for tightly coupled systems to accurately reproduce the fault behavior. For a loosely coupled system, instead, the one-way approach should be the preferred choice due to its lower computational cost. Later, we consider CO2 injection into a realistic formation, and we analyze the impact of the coupling frequency on the computational performance. We show that, for complex cases, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the reduction in the number of coupling iterations and the reduction in computational time for increasing coupling period.</description>

      <title>Life Cycle Assessment of Microalgae-Based Products for Carbon Dioxide Utilization in Thailand: Biofertilizer, Fish Feed, and Biodiesel</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.159019.1</link>
      <description>Adeel Rafiq, Cameron W. Morris, Abigail Schudel, Shabbir H. Gheewala, F1000Research. 13(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405196093

                Background Microalgae-based products offer a sustainable solution for food, fuel, and agricultural inputs, presenting environmental benefits and economic opportunities. A comprehensive assessment is needed to understand their potential in supporting sustainability goals, considering the complex interplay between production methods, energy sources, and environmental impacts. Methods This study evaluated the environmental impacts of three microalgae-derived products &#8211; biodiesel, fish feed, and biofertilizer &#8211; through a comprehensive life cycle assessment. Nine scenarios were explored comparing three electricity profiles (current Thai mix, 50% renewable/50% current mix hybrid, 100% renewable) across the three products. The assessment evaluated environmental impacts and potential economic benefits of transitioning to these microalgae-based alternatives. Results and discussion All products demonstrated potential for significant environmental benefits under increased renewable energy scenarios. Fish feed consistently exhibited the lowest environmental impacts across all categories examined, showing substantial improvements with increased renewable energy use. With an annual demand of 0.4 million tonnes, fish feed could generate USD 560 million in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 1.1 million tonnes. Fulfilling the projected biodiesel demand of 4,015 million liters per year through microalgae production could yield approximately USD 3.5 billion in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 30 million tonnes compared to conventional fossil-based diesel. Additionally, algal biofertilizer production could meet a 5 million tonnes annual demand, offering USD 2 billion in revenue while reducing CO2 emissions by 6 million tonnes yearly. Collectively, these products could offset 37 million tonnes of CO2, representing about 14% of Thailand&#8217;s total CO2 emissions, contributing significantly to the country&#8217;s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of 20-30% greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Conclusion Transitioning to microalgae-based products could transform the aquaculture, energy, and agricultural sectors, potentially supporting the national climate change mitigation goals, if implemented.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nexus between medical gases and ion channel function: implications for therapeutic innovation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.4103/mgr.medgasres-d-24-00076</link>
      <description>Chitaranjan Mahapatra, Medical Gas Research. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405166232

                Medical gases such as oxygen (O2), nitric oxide (NO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and xenon (Xe) are indispensable in contemporary medical practice. These gases are widely used in various therapeutic scenarios, including critical care, anesthesia, and respiratory therapy. While their primary applications are well established, emerging research suggests that these gases can modulate the function of ion channels&#8212;integral membrane proteins that facilitate the passage of ions across cell membranes. Ion channels such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca2+) ion channels play a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, regulating the membrane potential, and mediating signal transduction. The interaction between medical gases and ion channel function is an evolving area of research with significant implications for therapeutic innovation. This perspective examines the mechanisms by which medical gases influence ion channel activity and explores the potential clinical implications of these interactions. O2 is essential for cellular respiration and energy production, but its influence extends beyond these fundamental processes. O2 levels can modulate the activity of various ion channels, leading to diverse physiological and pathological outcomes. O2-sensitive K+ channels, particularly the voltagegated K+ (Kv) family, play crucial roles in regulating vascular tone and respiratory responses to hypoxia (low O2 levels).1 Under hypoxic conditions, these channels are inhibited, leading to membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx, which results in vasoconstriction. This mechanism is especially important in pulmonary circulation, where hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction redirects blood flow to better-oxygenated regions of the lungs. Additionally, the inhibition of Kv channels by hypoxia is central to the response of the carotid body, a key mechanism in regulating respiratory drive under low O2 conditions. O2 also affects Na+ channels (Nav), particularly in the central nervous system. Hypoxia can inhibit Nav channels, reducing neuronal excitability and potentially contributing to neuroprotection during ischemic events.2 Conversely, hyperoxia (high O2 levels) has been shown to increase Nav channel activity, which can exacerbate excitotoxicity (neuronal damage caused by the excessive release of glutamate or other excitatory plasma membrane receptors) and neuronal damage under certain pathological conditions. NO is a versatile signaling molecule involved in various physiological processes, including vasodilation, neurotransmission, and immune responses. Its interactions with ion channels are central to its broad biological effects. NO modulates Ca2+ channels (Cav) through multiple mechanisms.3 Directly, NO can nitrosylate cysteine residues on Cav channels, altering their gating properties. Indirectly, NO stimulates guanylate cyclase, increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels and activating protein kinase G, which phosphorylates the channels. The modulation of Cav channels by NO is crucial in regulating vascular smooth muscle tone, where NO-induced inhibition of these channels leads to vasodilation and a reduction in blood pressure. NO is known to modulate ion channels through S-nitrosylation, a process where NO attaches to specific cysteine residues on the channel protein. This modification can change the channel's structural configuration, affectingion conductance and gating properties. In large- conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels, structural changes induced by gas interactions can influence the selectivity filter, altering the ability of the channel to discriminate between different ions.4 The activation of BKca channels by NO is a key mechanism in NO-mediated vasodilation. NO can activate these channels directly through S-nitrosylation (covalent attachment of a nitric oxide group to a cysteine thiol within a protein to form an S-nitrosothiol) or indirectly via the cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;protein kinase G pathway. The activation of BKca channels leads to hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, which reduces Ca2+ entry and promotes the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells. CO2 plays a crucial role in maintaining acid&#8211;base balance and is a potent regulator of ion channel function. Changes in CO2 levels, which lead to alterations in the intracellular and extracellular pH, can significantly impact ion channel activity. Proton-sensitive ion channels, such as acid-sensingion channels and certain two-pore domain K+ (K2p) channels, are directly influenced by pH changes due to fluctuations in CO2 levels.5 Acid-sensing ion channels are activated by extracellular acidosis (low pH), contributing to the sensation of pain, particularly under ischemic conditions where CO2 levels are elevated. In contrast, K2P channels are inhibited by acidosis, leading to membrane depolarization and increased excitability in neurons and other excitable cells. CO2-induced acidosis also affects gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors, which are chloride ion channels critical for inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system.6 Acidosis enhances the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors, increasing inhibitory tone in the brain. This mechanism may contribute to the sedative effects of CO2 and its role in modulating respiratory drive. Xe, a noble gas with unique anesthetic properties, is distinguished by its minimal side effects and lack of significant cardiovascular depression. Xe's anesthetic and neuroprotective effects are primarily mediated through its interactions with ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors. One of the most extensively studied interactions of Xe is with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, a subtype of glutamate receptor involved in excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity.7 Xe inhibits NMDA receptors by competing with glycine at its coagonist binding site. This inhibition is believed to underlie Xe's anesthetic and neuroprotective effects, as NMDA receptor overactivation is associated with excitotoxicity and neuronal damage in conditions such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. Xe also modulates K+ channels, particularly the TWIK- related K+ channel (TREK-1), which is a member of the two-pore-domain potassium family. TREK- 1 channels are mechanosensitive and play a role in setting the resting membrane potential and providing neuroprotection.8 Xe activates TREK-1 channels, leading to membrane hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability, which may contribute to its anesthetic and neuroprotective effects. Figure 1 provides an overview of how different gases modulate ion channels across the cell membrane, influencing the membrane potential.Figure 1: A schematic diagram illustrating how various gases regulate different ion channels, influencing membrane excitability by altering the membrane potential.The N-methyl-D-aspartate, gamma-aminobutyric acid type A, and acid-sensing ion channels are represented by NMDA, GABA, and ASIC, respectively. &#916;V denotes the change in the membrane potential. X+ is the nonspecific ion flow via nonspecific ion channels by neurotransmitter activation. ASIC: Acid-sensing ion channels; cGMP: cyclic guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate; GABA: gamma-aminobutyric acid; NMDA: N-methyl-D-aspartate; PKG: protein kinase G.The interactions between medical gases and ion channels have significant clinical implications. Understanding these interactions can elucidate the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of medical gases, highlight potential adverse effects, and pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies. Ion channels play a critical role in various physiological processes, making them attractive targets for therapeutic interventions.9 Medical gases could be used to modulate these channels, offering new treatment options for various conditions. For example, NO donors are already used clinically to treat conditions such as pulmonary hypertension by promoting vasodilation through the activation of K+ channels.10 Similarly, the neuroprotective effects of Xe in conditions such as stroke and traumatic brain injury could be harnessed through its modulation of NMDA receptors and potassium channels. While medical gases offer therapeutic benefits, their interactions with ion channels can also lead to adverse effects.11 For example, prolonged hyperoxia can exacerbate excitotoxicity by increasing sodium channel activity, potentially leading to neuronal damage. Similarly, excessive NO can lead to overactivation of K+ channels, causing hypotension and other cardiovascular issues. Therefore, understanding these interactions is crucial for optimizing the safe and effective use of medical gases in clinical settings. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which medical gases interact with ion channels. This includes exploring the effects of these gases on less well-studied ion channels and understanding how these interactions vary across different tissues and disease states. Advances in this area could lead to the development of new gas-based therapies or the optimization of existing therapies for a broader range of clinical applications. Moreover, the development of selective ion channel modulators that mimic the effects of medical gases could offer a targeted approach for treating various conditions without the need for gas administration. For example, small molecules that selectively modulate O2- sensitive potassium channels could be developed to treat hypoxia-related disorders without the complications associated with O2 therapy. The interaction between medical gases and ion channels represents a promising and clinically significant area of research. Gases such as O2, NO, CO2, and Xe have profound effects on ion channel function, influencing a wide range of physiological processes and therapeutic outcomes. Ion channel agonists and antagonists of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ can help manage cellular pathologies by modulating the effects of gases such as NO, CO2, and O2. For Na+ channels, agonists such as veratridine enhance channel activity, whereas antagonists such as lidocaine and tetrodotoxin inhibit depolarization to reduce cellular excitability. K+ channel agonists, including minoxidil and retigabine, promote channel opening to stabilize the membrane potential, whereas antagonists such as 4-aminopyridine block these channels to delay repolarization. Ca2+ channel agonists such as Bay K8644 increase channel activity, boosting intracellular Ca2+ levels, whereas antagonists, such as nifedipine and verapamil reduce Ca2+ influx, help to prevent calcium overload. Together, these agents offer therapeutic options for counteracting gas-induced alterations in ion channel behavior. Understanding these interactions provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of action of these gases and opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention. As research progresses, this field holds the potential to revolutionize the management of various medical conditions through innovative gas-based and ion channel- targeted therapies.</description>

                The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological responses of cocoa plants (Theobroma cacao L.) subjected to water stress under flooding in different periods. The study was conducted in a greenhouse at the Capixaba Institute for Research, Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (INCAPER), located in Linhares-Es. The cultivars used for Theobroma cacao L. were cocoa varieties CCN 51 and TSH 1188, the first being used as a scion and the second as a rootstock. The experiment was carried out with cocoa seedlings under stress in a flooded environment, arranged in buckets and submerged in water, under different time conditions. Readings were taken at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 days of flooding. Measurements of net CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance, transpiration and water use efficiency were performed, all using IRGA. The treatment 2 days after flooding did not differ from the control treatment (without flooding), while in the treatment 4 DAA there was a reduction in the net CO2 assimilation content. Plants flooded for 8 days showed lenticel growth, showing an attempt to alleviate environmental conditions. There was no interference by flooding in the PI and PII photosystems; the photosynthetic apparatus remained stable.</description>

      <title>Thermal Performance, Indoor Air Quality, and Carbon Footprint Assessment in Airport Terminal Buildings</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14123957</link>
      <description>Mehmet Kadri Aky&#252;z, Emin A&#231;&#305;kkalp, &#214;nder Altunta&#351;, Buildings. 14(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405320157

                This study explores energy consumption, thermal performance, and indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in terminal buildings. Through detailed thermal analysis, this research identifies key sources of heat loss, such as thermal bridges in walls and windows, which significantly increase energy demands for heating. IEQ measurements show that the lack of mechanical ventilation, combined with high passenger densities, frequently leads to CO2 levels exceeding recommended thresholds, highlighting the urgent need for improved ventilation systems. Energy requirements were calculated based on the TS 825 standard and compared to actual consumption data, showing that optimizing boiler settings could save 22% of heating energy without any additional investment. Simulations and economic analyses further showed that adding thermal insulation to the building envelope and installing double-glazed windows with improved U-values could achieve significant energy savings and reduce CO2 emissions, all with favorable payback periods. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to evaluate the environmental impact of these interventions, demonstrating significant reductions in the airport&#8217;s carbon footprint. The findings underscore the importance of aligning operational standards with international guidelines, such as ASHRAE and CIBSE, to ensure thermal comfort and optimize energy use.</description>

      <title>Using agent-based modelling to simulate the emission reduction potential of CCUS technologies in China under alternative policy packages</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad9c9b</link>
      <description>Changgen Dong, Zhuoluo Sun, Jingjing Jiang, Yang Yang, Environmental Research Letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405222993

                Abstract Carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) technologies are essential for achieving the 1.5 &#176;C target. Predicting the emission reduction potential of CCUS technology is particularly important for countries to pursue carbon neutrality. However, the existing literature assessing the potential lacks consideration of the structural changes in industrial product demand and the trade-offs companies face between CCUS and traditional emission reduction technologies. This study used agent-based modelling (ABM) to simulate the emission reduction potential of CCUS in China's thermal power, steel, cement, and chemical industries from 2022 to 2060 under scenarios of different carbon prices, subsidies, and technology progress rates. The possible biases of the traditional prediction model were corrected incorporating the structural changes in industrial product demand and the marginal abatement cost curves of traditional emission reduction technologies for the four major industries into the ABM model. The simulation results indicate that under each of the 10 possible scenarios, China's CCUS technologies will reach 100% penetration in the four mentioned industries by 2060, with the emission reduction potential fluctuating between 2,222 and 1,568 Mt of CO2 (corresponding to 40% and 10% share of thermal power, respectively). The difference comes in the scaled-up threshold time point and the growth trend. Sensitivity analyses show that the carbon price affects changes in the emission reduction potential of CCUS technologies the most, while the impact of subsidies, rates of technological progress and oil prices were not significant. The stepped carbon price policy can effectively regulate and promote the expansion of CCUS emission reduction potential, which is worth considering for policymakers.&amp;#xD;</description>

      <title>Carbon Neutrality Pathways for Industrial Parks and Reduction Potential Based on Text Analysis and Empirical Research</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su162310771</link>
      <description>Yuheng Sun, Zhengyuan Feng, Fangtao Liu, Yuanhang Li, Jun Ning, Hang Fu, Shoujuan Tang, Guangxin Liu, Jing Wang, Lei Shi, Sustainability. 16(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405196088

                Climate change is seriously threatening ecological environments essential for human survival. Achieving the carbon neutrality goals of industrial parks (IPs), the gathering places of industrial activity, plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation and in promoting sustainable industrial development. In this study, we use an AI-facilitated literature review and empirical research to analyze and classify the 12 pathways for carbon neutrality for IPs based on the development nature and carbon flow framework. In addition, the carbon emission reduction potentials of various pathways are quantified using a case study. The results of the literature analysis show that, in terms of IP carbon emission reductions, most research has focused on the energy infrastructure related to energy management and utilization, as well as the service infrastructure related to the carbon footprint and industrial symbiosis. Among the 148 studies, &#8220;industrial symbiosis&#8221; and &#8220;carbon footprint&#8221; appeared with frequencies of 1278 and 474, respectively. Additionally, 102 of these studies mentioned decarbonization of energy infrastructure. In total, 11 of the carbon neutrality pathways existed in the empirical research, with the exception of carbon storage, and among them, 7 pathways are applied across all 104 IPs. Case studies indicate that the pathways with greater reduction potentials were the energy infrastructure, carbon capture, and the product and waste infrastructure, with potential reductions of 250,000 tons, 200,000 tons, and 145,080 tons of CO2 emissions, respectively. This study provides valuable references for IPs to achieve their carbon neutrality goals.</description>

                The paper presents aspects related the influence of the global gases emissions reduction targets on the design and performances of a propulsion system for a bulk carrier. In a first stage, the key elements of the ship propulsion system: main engine and propeller have been chosen and designed. The aim was to obtain the maximum propulsive efficiency at the owner desired speed. Different combinations: diesel engine-optimal propeller have been designed and analysed from the efficiency point of view. In a second stage, considering the mandatory IMO regulations concerning CO2 emissions, the EEDI (Energy Efficiency De sign Index) has been computed for every designed case. To compliance EEDI targets, it was been necessary to reduce the ship speed, and a new propulsion system with lower speed performances has been designed. In this study, ship hull shapes were given and EEDI be came an important and critical factor in the design of the ship propulsion system. Other potential pathways to achieve emissions reduction targets will need to be identify in a future study.</description>

                Background The literature doesn&#8217;t contain examples of patients with one lung who were treated with High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) after identifying hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. Discussion A 69 years-old male COPD associated, who had already a posttraumatic exeresis from an accident at work, went to the ER of our Hospital to severe dyspnea. At CT of thorax, an consolidation was found in the left basal region. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed severe hypercapnia and severe hypoxemia. The patient was admitted to the Emergency Medicine, where NIV + OLT was administered. We were contacted for a transfer. In our department, a bronchoscopy was performed, which documented the presence of dense secretions. A new antibiotic therapy was initiated and was placed on High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC). The decision to use HFNC was considered for better secretion management, for CO2 wash-out effect and humidified gas mixtures. During hospitalization, the patient adapted to this system, and a progressive improvement was observed. Results and Conclusion Follow-up 30- 90 days showed a significant reduction in blood CO2 levels. The chronic use of HFNC is still under study, we believe it could be a possible solution for patients with global chronic respiratory failure and stable COPD.</description>

                Silicon-based photoelectrochemical devices show promise for the performance of light-driven CO2 reduction but suffer from instability under photoelectrochemical conditions relevant to CO2 reduction. Coating silicon electrodes with thin layers of metal oxides has shown promise to passivate unstable silicon surfaces, and many different metal oxides can be deposited on silicon using various techniques. In this study, we investigate the fundamental photoelectrochemical performance of WO3-coated silicon photoelectrodes, which were generated by oxidation of W-metal films deposited via atomic layer deposition on both degenerately doped (nSi+) and low-doped (pSi) silicon. Two different oxidation temperatures were investigated (400 and 600 &#176;C), and it was found that the monoclinic phase of WO3 predominates at both temperatures but that more grain boundaries are present in the 600 &#176;C film. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the stoichiometry of both films was found to be 1:3 W:O, and low electron energy loss experiments indicate band gaps of 3.0 and 3.1 eV for 400 and 600 &#176;C films, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry experiments showed that the electron transfer kinetics increased after continued redox cycling, particularly for the material produced at 400 &#176;C. X-ray photoelectron spectra suggest that the observed increase in electrode conductivity is due to the formation of oxygen vacancies in the film. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated that charge transport through the films was impacted by the grain boundaries that formed during oxidation of the film. Photoelectrochemical studies on pSi/WO3 electrodes were highly variable, only producing a photocurrent and photovoltage with some samples. Our best sample, formed at 400 &#176;C, produced a photovoltage of 180 mV, which is lower than what has previously been reported for WO3-coated silicon (500 mV). We hypothesize that the variability in photoelectrochemical experiments arose from a roughened WSiOx interface that is generated during film preparation. WO3 shows promise as a metal oxide coating for silicon, but our results suggest that formation of a high-quality interface between Si and WO3 is vital for best performance.</description>

                Air pollution from the shipping industry is an ongoing problem that requires exploring innovative technologies for effective resolution. The integration of wind-assisted ship propulsion (WASP) technology offers a promising route towards decarbonisation of the shipping industry. The paper investigates possible fuel savings and CO2 reduction by implementing wind assisted propulsion on a case-study vessel operating on a known route in the Adriatic Sea. The long-term contribution of added wind propulsion is analysed by implementing a Velocity Prediction Program (VPP) and available meteorological data for the area of interest. VPP is modified to predict the contribution of wind propulsion to the overall propulsion necessary to achieve the vessel design speed. The case study quantifies long-term fuel savings for ship operating a liner route and harnessing favourable (predictable) north-west winds, complementing the conventional propulsion systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Sustainability and Social Perceptions of Recycled PET BubbleDeck Slabs in Urban Development: A Case Study in Oman</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.61707/9v0jgp95</link>
      <description>Mariam Alnuaimi, Daud Bin Mohamed, International Journal of Religion. 5(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405350066

                This study investigates the adoption of recycled PET BubbleDeck slabs in Oman, focusing on sustainability, economic feasibility, social perceptions, and regulatory support. Using a questionnaire-based survey analysed through SPSS, the research explores key determinants, including carbon footprint reduction, material efficiency, life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA), public awareness, and policy frameworks, with stakeholder awareness mediating the relationships. Results demonstrate that BubbleDeck slabs reduce CO2 emissions by 33% and concrete usage by 25%, aligning with Oman Vision 2040&#8217;s emphasis on sustainable construction. However, high initial costs and limited public awareness hinder adoption. The study&#8217;s regression analysis highlights that sustainability metrics and regulatory support are significant predictors of adoption, with carbon footprint reduction and certifications playing critical roles. Economic feasibility, particularly LCCA, positively impacts adoption, while initial costs present barriers. Public awareness and trust in technology emerged as essential social factors driving acceptance. This research underscores the importance of policy-driven incentives, public education campaigns, and stakeholder collaboration in promoting innovative green technologies. The findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners to advance sustainable urban development and foster the widespread adoption of BubbleDeck technology in the construction sector.</description>

      <title>Energy Transition Planning in Achieving the Net Zero Emission 2060 Target in the Provincial Electricity Sector North Sumatra</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.58451/ijebss.v3i2.199</link>
      <description>Muhamad Iqbal Sutikno, Suhanan Suhanan, Ahmad Agus Setiawan, International Journal of Engineering Business and Social Science. 3(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405277797

                This research discusses the energy transition towards the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) 2060 target in the electricity sector of North Sumatra Province. The challenges faced include dependence on fossil fuels, high greenhouse gas emissions, and limited renewable energy capacity. The study aims to model energy transition scenarios, evaluate the optimal renewable energy mix, and determine emission reduction strategies in the electricity sector using LEAP-NEMO software. This study uses a forecasting-based simulation modeling method with a mathematical approach through LEAP software and NEMO optimization framework. Three scenarios were analyzed, namely Business As Usual (BAU), Net Zero Emissions Carbon Capture Storage (NZE CCS), and Net Zero Emissions Full Renewable Energy (NZE FRE). The simulation results show that the NZE FRE scenario is able to achieve a 100% renewable energy mix by 2060, outperforming the BAU (42.1%) and NZE CCS (70.8%) scenarios. Solar, biomass, hydro, and geothermal energy are the main sources of energy, with solar energy as the largest contributor. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by up to 265.9 million tons of CO2 (70.5%) compared to the BAU scenario. These findings provide policy recommendations that support the implementation of renewable energy, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and fiscal policies that internalize environmental costs. The study also highlights the importance of investing in clean energy technologies to realize a sustainable electricity system in Indonesia.</description>

      <title>Life Cycle Assessment of Crude Oil-Contaminated Soil Treated by Low-Temperature Thermal Desorption and Its Beneficial Reuse for Soil Amendment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su162410900</link>
      <description>Young Ho Song, Geon Yong Kim, Da Yeon Kim, Yong Woo Hwang, Sustainability. 16(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405321785

                The effectiveness of thermal treatment technologies for the remediation of soils contaminated with heavy hydrocarbons has been extensively documented in the scientific literature. In general, high-concentration crude-oil-contaminated soil is treated with high-temperature thermal desorption (HTTD) in order to achieve high remediation efficiency. However, this process has the unintended consequence of destroying soil fertility. Low-temperature thermal desorption (LTTD) represents an alternative approach that has been developed with the objective of remediating heavily crude-oil-contaminated soil in a more rapid and cost-effective manner while simultaneously enhancing soil fertility. The thermal desorption unit (TDU) was employed using both LTTD and HTTD, operating at 300 &#176;C and 500 &#176;C, respectively, with a 30 min residence time in the kiln. The concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in both the LTTD- and HTTD-treated soils was found to be less than 1% by weight, thereby below regulatory standards. The environmental impacts of both processes were assessed using the OpenLCA software version 2.0. The HTTD process exhibited a total abiotic depletion potential (ADP) impact of 1.63 &#215; 10&#8722;4 MJ and a global warming potential (GWP) of 414 kg CO2-eq. In contrast, LTTD demonstrated lower impacts, with an ADP of 1.29 &#215; 10&#8722;4 MJ and a GWP of 278 kg CO2-eq. The transition from HTTD to LTTD resulted in a notable reduction in ADP by 20.5% and in GWP by 32.9%. The application of LTTD-treated soil coated with coke or carbonized residues has been demonstrated to serve as an effective soil amendment, with the capacity to sequester approximately 50% of organic hydrocarbon contaminants. The results of this study illustrate the potential of LTTD for not only economical and rapid soil remediation but also the enhancement of soil quality through beneficial reuse.</description>

      <title>Clonal differences in ecophysiological responses to imposed drought in selected &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus grandis&lt;/i&gt; x &lt;i&gt;E. urophylla&lt;/i&gt; hybrids</title>

                Measuring ecophysiological responses of Eucalyptus clones grown under reduced water availability could assist in clonal selection for climate resilience. We hypothesized that clonal variation in chlorophyll a fluorescence was more readily detected than variations in leaf-level gas-exchanges when two-year-old E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid clones (C1, C2, C3, and C4) were grown under rainfed (RF) and water-restricted (WR) conditions were evaluated during dry and rainy seasons, in the morning and midday diurnal periods. The C2 clone was the most drought tolerant as it had a similar net CO2 assimilation rate (A) considering the RF and WR conditions at midday during the dry season, while C1, C3, and C4 CO2 assimilation rates (A) decreased by 29.1 %, 28.3%, and 13%, respectively. This response was associated with a reduction to a lesser extent in leaf water potential, stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rates (E) (ca. 10%, 30% and 13% under WR, respectively), when compared to the other clones during the dry season at midday. The lower leaf to air vapor pressure deficit of C2 contributed to its greater water use efficiency (WUE), resulting in greater total dry mass gain. C1, C3 and C4 were less drought tolerant, decreasing gs, E and especially A under WR, resulting in lower WUE and total dry mass gain. Chlorophyll a fluorescence indexes were better indicators of drought tolerance compared to gas-exchange parameters in definition of drought tolerance of clonal Eucalyptus. Three drought sensitive clones showed low photochemical efficiency under WR, with the electron transport rate being impaired between photosystems II and I, indicated by the greater changes in photosynthetic performance index (PIabs). Under WR conditions, Fv/Fm, &#936;0, &#934;E0, and PIabs decreased in all clones while &#934;D0 and DI0/CS0 increased, with C2 showing the most stable responses suggesting that the photochemical apparatus was the less damaged by drought. Thus, C2 was the best clone for regions with water scarcity.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.2478/jaes-2024-0031</link>
      <description>Saloua Filali, Abdelkader Nasser, Journal of Applied Engineering Sciences. 14(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405231118

                Abstract This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and marble coarse aggregates as sustainable substitutes in concrete production, responding to the increasing demand for infrastructure and the necessity to diminish the carbon footprint of construction materials. By partially substituting cement, a material that generates substantial greenhouse gas emissions, fly ash, a by-product of coal combustion, recognizes its capacity to reduce CO2 emissions. The stone processing industry produces marble waste, which, by repurposing otherwise wasted byproducts, offers an environmentally sustainable solution, simultaneously reducing the use of natural resources in the manufacture of traditional aggregates. The research aims to assess the effects of incorporating various ratios of fly ash, ranging from 10% to 50%, and marble coarse aggregates, ranging from 10% to 90%, on the workability, compressive strength, split tensile strength, and flexural strength. The results show a moderate decrease in a slump, with an 18.66% reduction at 50% marble coarse aggregates and 30% fly ash, and a significant increase in compressive strength, with a 60.22% improvement at 56 days with 40% fly ash and 70% marble coarse aggregates. Split tensile strength also improved by 35.50% to 36.66%. Non-destructive tests confirmed the structural integrity of the concrete. This study emphasizes the potential of fly ash and marble coarse aggregates as eco-friendly substitutes in concrete production.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Cogeneration to Support a Net-Zero, High-Renewable Electricity Grid</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17246219</link>
      <description>Juan Matthews, William Bodel, Gregg Butler, Energies. 17(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405242412

                UK Government projections anticipate increasing electricity use, provided by variable renewables (i.e., wind and solar PV). A side effect of increasing the proportion of variable renewable generation is increased support costs, including curtailment, energy storage, and (most significantly) the cost of supplying electricity for periods of high demand when variable renewable generation is low. As the proportion of variable renewable capacity increases, demand for supporting capacity increases but the capacity factor of the support generation decreases, raising the support costs. Using nuclear power for dedicated baseload supply makes the situation worse. This paper explores in the UK context an original low-cost solution using nuclear cogeneration with hydrogen production as the main application. Electricity is diverted at low cost to the grid at times of high demand when renewables are not available. This ensures nuclear maintains a high capacity factor. When higher temperature advanced systems become available, using thermal energy storage will increase the nuclear electrical capacity. This &#8220;Flexible Nuclear&#8221; scenario substantially reduces support costs for accommodating variable renewables, saving GBP 14 bn/yr and leading to an 80% reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions, compared to a recent UK Government scenario utilising a large capacity of hydrogen and unabated gas generation at very low capacity factors.</description>

      <title>Microbial Upgrading of Lignin Depolymerization: Enhancing Efficiency with Lignin&#8208;First Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202400954</link>
      <description>Aditya Ponukumati, Rhiannon Carr, Zahra Ebrahimpourboura, Yifeng Hu, N. ANAND, Yu Gao, Zeyu Shang, Anirudh Krishnamurthy, Mark Mba Wright, Tae Seok Moon, Marcus Foston, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405197262

                Chemical depolymerization of lignin is a non&#8208;selective process that often generates a wide distribution of product compounds, denoted herein as lignin breakdown products (LBPs). To address this limitation, we developed a hybrid lignin conversion approach that employs a lignin&#8208;first catalytic approach on biomass and subsequent microbial upgrading. A Pd/C catalyst was used for reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) of poplar biomass, and Rhodococcus opacus PD630 (R. opacus PD630) was then cultivated on the resulting LBPs. This RCF approach increases the total biomass utilization by R. opacus PD630 over base&#8208;catalyzed depolymerization (BCD) reactions that were performed in the absence of Pd/C and molecular hydrogen (H2). LBPs generated using RCF resulted in higher cell growth per gram of biomass. Cellulose in the residual biomass after RCF treatment also showed enhanced enzymatic digestibility due to saccharification yields over 40%. Techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle analysis (LCA) of this hybrid lignin conversion scheme, integrated into a cellulosic bioethanol plant, decreased the minimum ethanol selling price from $4.07/gallon (base case) to $3.94/gallon. Global warming potentials ranged from 29 and 30.5 CO2,eq/MJ. These results highlight the potential for an industrial hybrid conversion&#8208;based biorefinery scheme that utilizes lignin&#8208;first catalytic deconstruction and R. opacus PD630 upgrading.</description>

                This study investigated the electro-mineralization of chloroquine (CQ) in a filter-press-type flow reactor using two BDD electrodes operating in batch recirculation mode. The optimal operating parameters were established using response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite rotatable design (CCRD) with three parameters: current density (j), initial pH (pH0), and volumetric flow rate (Q), with the mineralization efficiency of (CQ) and specific energy consumption (SEC) as responses. Optimal operating parameters were j = 155.0 mA/cm2, pH0 = 9.75, and Q = 0.84 L/min within a reaction time of 9 h, leading to a maximum mineralization efficiency of CQ of 52.59% and a specific energy consumption of 15.73 kW/mg TOC, with a total operating cost of USD 0.18 per liter. Additionally, an ultra-high-performance chromatography study identified three by-products (4-amino-7-choloroquinoline, formic acid, and acid acetic) of CQ degradation. Furthermore, the phytotoxicity test indicates that the electrochemical wastewater proposed decreased the effluent&#8217;s phytotoxicity, and an increase in the percentage of Vigna radiata germination was observed. The carbon footprint of optimized electrochemical mineralization of chloroquine is 2.48 kg CO2 eq., representing a 48% reduction in cumulative energy demand (CED) when the source of energy is a mixture of fossil fuels (50%), wind (25%), and photovoltaic (25%) energy.</description>

                Objectives: The quantity of CO2 emissions that combustion energy sources in power plants, cars, industry, business sectors, households, and other sectors emit into the atmosphere would influence global warming. Therefore, reducing global warming may be achieved by energy efficiency technology and low-carbon energy sources. By examining how MRV, a ground-breaking REDD+ technology from Indonesia, Brazil, and Congo Governance, transformed forested landscapes into carbon domain that could be observed and controlled via the use of data-intensive mapping and techniques model. Theoretical Framework: To reduce deforestation, REDD+ was initially designed to be a scheme in which rich countries would compensate poor countries with trees (maybe through carbon markets). However, there have been questions over whether REDD+ will lead to significant reductions in emissions. Carbon reductions in the forest sector are becoming increasingly important for reducing emissions and meeting the NDC. Method: This study looks at literature reviews as a research method in addition to giving an overview of the many types of reviews and some standards for conducting and assessing literature review articles regarding carbon emission declarations and subsidiaries in Congo, Brazil, and Indonesia might be used. Result and Discussion: This study should be identified and analysed as follows: (i) Districts and regionals should be given incentives to produce or harvest more timber instead of disincentives from Nation Governance; (ii) State Forest mining fees should be increased to fully defray the costs of reclamation and rehabilitation of areas mined; (iii) Tightening technical requirements for underground mining in protection forests would limit the number of mining permits that local governments could be granted. Research Implications: This study achieved sustainable and equitable growth for everybody, there will need to be greater global collaboration on trade and climate change about carbon emission disclosures and subsidiaries. Originality/Value: This study identified and analysed carbon emission disclosures and subsidiaries in Indonesia, Brazil, and Congo also how to imply the regulations among those country.</description>

      <title>Decarbonization of oil rig platforms: An integrated approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.30574/wjarr.2022.14.3.0655</link>
      <description>Kelvin Edem Bassey, World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews. 14(3)] 2022. https://openalex.org/W4405263930

                The decarbonization of oil rig platforms is increasingly critical as the global energy sector transitions toward more sustainable practices. This paper presents an integrated approach to reducing carbon emissions from offshore oil rigs, focusing on the synergy of renewable energy integration, carbon capture and storage (CCS), operational efficiency, and supportive policy frameworks. Offshore oil platforms are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and their decarbonization is essential for aligning the oil and gas industry with global climate goals. This paper explores the potential of renewable energy sources, such as offshore wind and solar power, to replace fossil fuel-based energy generation on oil rigs. The integration of hybrid energy systems that combine wind, solar, and energy storage solutions offers a promising path toward continuous and reliable power supply while reducing emissions. Additionally, the implementation of CCS technologies on oil platforms is reviewed, highlighting their role in capturing and storing CO2 emissions, thereby mitigating their environmental impact. Operational efficiency and process optimization are also examined as critical components of decarbonization efforts. By improving energy efficiency, reducing flaring, and enhancing digitalization and automation, oil rigs can significantly lower their carbon footprint. Waste heat recovery is identified as another opportunity to convert excess heat from operations into useful energy, further contributing to emission reductions. The paper also emphasizes the importance of policy and regulatory support in driving decarbonization initiatives. Effective regulatory frameworks, economic incentives, and international cooperation are crucial for overcoming the technical, economic, and social challenges associated with decarbonizing oil rig platforms. In conclusion, the decarbonization of oil rig platforms requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that leverages technological innovation, operational improvements, and robust policy support. By addressing the challenges and opportunities outlined in this paper, the oil and gas industry can play a vital role in the global effort to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.</description>

      <title>Genomic and proteomic characterization of sulfate-reducing symbionts of gutless marine annelids</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.09.627487</link>
      <description>Grace D&#8217;Angelo, Manuel Kleiner, Anna Mankowski, Jeronimo Cifuentes-Anticevic, Eileen Kroeber, Marlene Violette, Valerie De Anda, Nicole Dubilier, Manuel Liebeke, bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405175475

                Sulfate-reducing bacteria inhabit marine and terrestrial environments, forming syntrophic associations with other bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. A notable example is the symbiosis between sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and gutless oligochaete worms found in marine sediments worldwide. These endosymbionts participate in a syntrophic sulfur exchange with the primary endosymbiont of gutless oligochaetes, a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, thus providing otherwise inaccessible metabolic capabilities to the animal host. Here, we used a combination of metagenomic and metaproteomic analysis to describe the metabolic functions of SRBs from gutless annelids. Identified as members of the Desulfobacteria class, closely related to the Desulfococcus and Desulfosarcina genera, these SRB symbionts exhibit a range of common and unique metabolic capabilities. Our analyses revealed their core metabolism of complete oxidation of acetate to CO2 via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, glyoxylate bypass of the TCA cycle, degradation of glycine as a nitrogen source, and presence of transporters for essential nutrients. A large-scale genome comparison revealed that the sulfate-reducing endosymbionts, named here "Candidatus Desulfoconcordia", have metabolic distinctions with respect to their free-living counterparts that could indicate adaptation to the energy and nutrient requirements of their symbiotic niche. The enrichment of functions like peptidases and amino acid transporters together with their abundant expression in the proteomes and the reduction of sugar and sulfur scavenging functions in the symbiotic genomes indicate a symbiosis-driven ecological role distinct from free-living SRBs. Our study revealed the metabolic capabilities that have enabled "Candidatus Desulfoconcordia" to adapt to their multi-domain associations.</description>

      <title>Impact of Wall Paint Solar Absorptance on CO2 Emissions in Residential Buildings: A Case Study from Bangkok</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14123958</link>
      <description>Rungroj Wongmahasiri, Tarid Wongvorachan, Chaniporn Thampanichwat, Suphat Bunyarittikit, Buildings. 14(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405321513

                Electricity consumption in buildings is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which drive climate change. Reducing electricity use in residential buildings, which account for approximately 20% of Thailand&#8217;s total electricity consumption, represents a key opportunity for lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of this study was to assess the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through the use of appropriate solar absorptance in wall paint, conducted via an energy simulation using a representative residential building model from Bangkok. The DOE2.1E program was employed to simulate a standard two-story house commonly found in Thailand, with an approximate floor area of 120 square meters. The window-to-wall ratios were set at 10% and 20%, and air conditioning usage was modeled for nighttime hours. External wall paint was assigned varying solar absorption coefficients, ranging from 10% to 90%. Greenhouse gas emissions were calculated by multiplying the simulated annual electricity consumption by the emission factor, expressed in kgCO2eq/kWh, provided by the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization. The results indicated that adjusting wall paint solar absorptance from 10% to 90% led to a 10% variation in both energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, potentially reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 411&#8211;456 kgCO2eq per house per year. Therefore, implementing regulations that mandate the use of wall paints with appropriate solar absorption coefficients could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to environmental protection efforts in Thailand.</description>

      <title>Improving cold resistance and shelf life of Carica papaya Linn through 1- methylcyclopropene and geranium oil applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26656/fr.2017.8(s7).9</link>
      <description>Meng Yi Loh, Noranizan Mohd Adzahan, Ezzat Mohamad Azman, Soo Peng Koh, Noor Liyana Yusof, Food Research. 8(Supplementary 7)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405200773

                The perishability and susceptibility to chilling of Carica papaya Linn have impeded its long-distance exportation, posing challenges to international trade investments. This study explores the efficacy of 1-MCP and geranium oil (GO) treatments in enhancing papaya's cold tolerance. Designated concentrations for 1-MCP were 300 and 600 mg/L, and for GO, 2% and 4% (v/v), with exposure times set at 30 and 60 mins. Subsequently, the fruits were stored at 4&#176;C for 16 days, and various parameters such as chilling injury (CI), weight loss (WL), respiratory rate (RR), firmness, colour, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), pH, and ripening index (RI) were assessed at 4-day intervals. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in chilling damage in treated fruits. Specifically, the 60-minute exposure to 600 mg/L 1-MCP (MCP600+60) delayed the development of CI symptoms by at least 4 days compared to the control. At day 16, MCP600+60 exhibited the least WL (1.93%), O2 consumption (4.19&#177;0.25 mL/kg/hr), and CO2 production (4.05&#177;0.17 mL/kg/hr). Treated fruits, especially MCP600+60 and 30-minute exposure to 4% (v/v) GO (GO4+30), preserved firmness and colour. In GO treatments, GO4+30 showed the least increase in TSS (1.69-fold) and pH (1.09-fold). The highest TA and RI were reported in MCP600+60 and GO4+30. Overall, MCP600+60 emerged as the most effective treatment for enhancing papaya's cold tolerance and storage quality based on our study.</description>

      <title>Life Cycle Assessment of End-of-Life Tire Disposal Methods and Potential Integration of Recycled Crumb Rubber in Cement Composites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app142411667</link>
      <description>Girts Kolendo, Viktoria Voronova, &#290;irts B&#363;manis, Aleksandrs Korjakins, Di&#257;na Baj&#257;re, Applied Sciences. 14(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405366430

                Globally, 1.5 billion annual tire outputs generate a substantial volume of end-of-life tires (ELTs), creating significant environmental challenges. Despite increased recovery rates, ELT management costs in Europe underscore the need for proactive strategies to mitigate environmental and health risks. This study comprehensively evaluates the environmental impact of disposal methods, including landfilling, incineration, and crumb rubber production, using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) via the OpenLCA software 2.0.2. While incineration is sometimes identified as a disposal method, unprocessed scrap tires have potential applications in civil engineering that can better align with sustainability goals. Detailed ELT composition analysis reveals significant recycling potential, with car and truck tires containing 10&#8211;20% steel fiber content, less than 1&#8211;8% textile fibers, and approximately 80% natural and synthetic rubber content. Recycling 1 ton of ELTs saves an estimated 1.4&#8211;1.6 tons of CO2 Eq. compared to incineration. Mechanical recycling and application of recycled crumb rubber in concrete show significant environmental advantages, reducing mass density by approximately 55% and enhancing ductility by up to 40%, according to material testing results. These properties make crumb rubber particularly suitable for acoustic and resilient applications. Additionally, its elasticity and durability offer effective solutions for shoreline reinforcement, mitigating erosion and providing stability during flooding events. When used as a replacement for river sand in cement composites, crumb rubber contributes to a 24.06% reduction in CO&#8322; emissions, highlighting its potential for environmentally friendly construction.</description>

      <title>Influence of fiber direction on the tribological behavior of carbon-reinforced PEEK at elevated temperature for application in gas turbine engines</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4067410</link>
      <description>Marie-Laurence Cliche, Robert Mone, Andre C. Liberati, Pantcho Stoyanov, Journal of Tribology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405306656

                Abstract The aerospace industry aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, requiring gas turbine engines to reduce CO2 emissions. This will impact engine material selection due to harsher operating conditions, limiting traditional metal/alloy use. While fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) composites are commonly used in the aerospace industry, their use in gas turbine engines is often restricted by the lower operating temperatures of the polymer matrix. However, many studies have demonstrated the tribological potential of FRP in the fan section of the engines, but little attention has been given to the potential of orienting the fibers in the normal (i.e., out-of-plane) direction relative to the wear surface to leverage the anisotropic properties of FRP composites. This study aims to investigate the impact of fiber orientation on the tribological properties of carbon fiber/PEEK (CF-PEEK) at elevated temperatures. Three CF-PEEK samples with different fiber rientations were selected for the purpose of this study (parallel, anti-parallel and normal directions), as well as a fourth sample of pure PEEK. Tribological tests were conducted using a ball-on-disk tribometer at an elevated temperature of 200&#176;C to evaluate wear and friction behavior. The worn surfaces and counterfaces were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). The findings reveal that CF-PEEK with fibers oriented in the normal direction demonstrates significantly enhanced tribological performance at elevated temperatures, achieving a 95% reduction in the friction coefficient and a 92% decrease in the wear rate compared to pure PEEK. A wear mechanism has been proposed to explain the superior wear resistance of normally oriented fibers in CF-PEEK, linking it to the development of a fiber-based interface during the run-in phase and the formation of a uniform transfer film.</description>

      <title>Automatic ventilation and cooling of the building using the combination of wind deflector and solar chimney (state 3D with differential perspective)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.58396/gbm020104</link>
      <description>Ahmadi Hamidreza Babaeyan, S&#225;nchez-Torija Jorge Gallego, Green Buildings and Materials. 2(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405157037

                Using new sources of energy and inventing new methods for energy consumption has always been the focus of researchers. The building sector is known to contribute largely in total energy consumption and CO2. Expanding the availability of energy storage technology and materials is considered as crucial as discovering new energy sources. The International Energy Outlook by the EIA (Energy Information Administration of the outlook) examines and predicts future trends in building energy usage. It anticipates a 34% growth in energy consumption within the built environment over the next two decades, with an average annual increase of 1.5%. By 2030, it is projected that approximately 67% of this consumption will be attributed to dwellings, while the non-domestic sectors will account for about 33%. This study endeavors to combine one of these ventilation techniques from ancient Persian architecture, known as the windcatcher in the form of an innovative roof radiative cooling (Windcatcher) with a solar chimney. In order to save energy consumption and reduce environmental problems by presenting the idea of using solar energy to exhaust the air inside the building through the chimney and using the latent heat of water evaporation to create cooling that is carried out in the direction of the wind by the windcatcher. Hence, fuel consumption can be created in hot and dry areas, in a comfortable environment with suitable humidity conditions. The purpose of this research is to introduce computational areas (3D) and determine the governing values and methods calculated by Ansys Fluent software, which has enabled the use of suction and the creation of moisture balance and heat reduction without fuel consumption, which plays an important role in It implements energy efficiency in the building. This system is also able to save 60% cooling energy and 80% of the ventilation energy during peak hours in a warm and arid climate. Furthermore, the effects of a wall opening on ventilation and thermal efficiency were examined.</description>

                Today's world is facing a criticalglobal challenge of rising temperatures and disrupted ecosystems, primarily driven by increased carbon emissions. The study aims to determine the major factors leading to carbon emissions in five major carbon-emitting countries: China, the United States, India, Russia, and Japan. Specifically, it explores the interplay between economic growth, natural resource rent (Natural Resource Rent: The economic benefit a country gains from its natural resources, such as oil or minerals, after subtracting the cost of extracting and using them), technological change, renewable energy use, and carbon emissions. The study postulates that economic growth and natural resource extraction bear a substantial interaction that contributes to carbon emissions. At the same time, technological change and the usage of renewable energy could probably become imperative to alleviate such emissions. This research, therefore, provides a good insight into the determinants of CO2 emissions in these key economies and the probable pathways toward emission reduction through innovation and harnessing of renewable sources of energy. Utilizing the comprehensive dataset between 1990 and 2021 and employing the ARDL [Panel ARDL (Autoregressive Distributed Lag): A statistical method used to analyze how different factors affect each other over time in a dataset that includes multiple subjects (e.g., countries)] model on the panel data, this study examines both the short- and long-term effects of these variables on carbon emissions, considering cross-country heterogeneity. The results underscore the significance related to guidelines for sustainable development practices and the necessity for these leading economies to lead the shift towards sustainability. By identifying factors that can mitigate emissions and enhance resilience, this research provides useful inputs to the policymakers who intend to promote renewable sources of energy usage along with technological upgrades. This study's results contribute to the existing literature by making it a significant resource for future policy formulation and academic research in the field of mitigating climate change.</description>

                Sulfidogenic bacteria cause numerous issues in the oil industry since they produce sulfide, corroding steel equipment, reducing oil quality, and worsening the environmental conditions in oil fields. The purpose of this work was to isolate and taxonomically identify the sulfidogenic bacteria responsible for the corrosion of steel equipment at the Karazhanbas oil field (Kazakhstan). In this study, we characterized five sulfidogenic strains of the genera Pseudodesulfovibrio, Oleidesulfovibrio, and Acetobacterium isolated from the formation water of the Karazhanbas oil field (Kazakhstan). Sulfate-reducing strain 9FUST revealed 98.9% similarity of the 16S rRNA gene sequence with the closely related strain &#8216;Pseudodesulfovibrio methanolicus&#8217; 5S69T and was studied in detail to enhance the taxonomic resolution. Strain 9FUST grew optimally at 23&#8211;28 &#176;C, pH 6.5, and 0&#8211;2% (w/v) NaCl. The strain used lactate, pyruvate, methanol, ethanol, fructose, ribose, and H2/CO2 (in the presence of acetate) as carbon and energy sources for sulfate reduction. Iso-C17:1 &#969;11, C15:0, iso-C15:0, and C16:0 were the predominant fatty acids. The genome is 4.20 Mbp with a G + C content of 64.0%. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA&#8211;DNA hybridization values with Pseudodesulfovibrio spp. genomes were 72.5&#8211;91.6% (&lt;95%) and 18.5&#8211;45.0% (&lt;70%), respectively, and supported our conclusion that 9FUST (=VKM B-3654T = KCTC 25498T) belonged to a novel Pseudodesulfovibrio species, for which the name Pseudodesulfovibrio karagichevae sp. nov. is proposed. Pangenome analysis of sixteen Pseudodesulfovibrio species and functional annotation analysis of identified genes revealed complete modules of enzymes of the main metabolic pathways, characteristic of bacteria of this genus, and unique genes highlighting the adaptations of strain 9FUST in carbohydrate metabolism, nutrient uptake, and environmental stress response. Isolation of these strains expands our understanding of the diversity of sulfidogens in oil reservoirs and can be used to test the effectiveness of biocides used in an oil field.</description>

                Abstract This paper provides an overview of Enbridge Gas Transmission and Midstream&#8217;s PHMSA special permitted project to install and use Smartpipe&#174; to retrofit 0.64 miles of an 8-inch diameter, 1965 vintage steel pipeline, known as the Line 3320A-100. The new 6.25-inch internal diameter (ID), 7.6-inch outer diameter (OD) Smartpipe&#174; was inserted through a small segment of the existing 8-inch diameter steel pipeline, which improves pipeline integrity and safety by eliminating corrosion and increasing resistance to third-party damage. Smartpipe&#174; also significantly reduced the environmental impact and disturbance associated with the excavation, earth disturbance, and other activities that would have been necessary with removal of the existing 8-inch diameter steel pipeline and the installation of a new steel pipeline in the right of way (ROW). In addition to an overview of the engineering design and construction of the project, the short- and long-term use case of the Smartpipe technology over traditional materials is explored. Smartpipe&#174; offers a high strength composite pipe liner solution that involves a trenchless installation within the existing steel line to minimize disruption to both operations and the environment. Embedded fibre optics within the Smartpipe&#174; offer real time leak detection monitoring capabilities and ROW activity real time monitoring along the entire length of the pipe. This ESG centric solution not only provides a reduction in carbon footprint when compared to traditional construction methods (open trench pipe replacement and horizontal directional drill replacement) and it is designed to address high consequence and difficult to access areas where operator systems may pass through. Smartpipe&#174; has high pressure capabilities to provide repurposing opportunities for aging, derated and abandoned pipe assets. Smartpipe&#174; is DOE tested for hydrogen use and compatibility with CO2 to provide a bridge to future energy sources. This study serves as a valuable case for industry professionals, offering lessons learned, a PHMSA special permit application template for Smartpipe&#174; replacements as well as education and knowledge on the Smartpipe&#174; technology and installation considerations.</description>

      <title>Development of high performance cement-based composites reinforced with nonwoven fabrics from sustainable raw materials and textile wastes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5821/dissertation-2117-420258</link>

                (English) Currently there is a growing concern about the sustainability of the construction sector due to its great contribution to climate change. Approximately one third of carbon dioxide emissions are produced by this sector, both during the construction and operational phases of buildings. Another environmental problem is the abundance of waste produced by industrial processes and products at the end of their useful life. In this sense, the use of more sustainable building materials and, in particular, the reduction of the necessary amount of cement is of great interest. This thesis focuses on developing and characterizing sustainable cement-based building materials reinforced with biodegradable nonwoven fabrics or produced from fibers recovered from textile wastes, mainly designed to be applied on thin panels for application on ventilated facades, pavements and reinforcement of masonry structures, as well as for the development of multifunctional sandwich panels for applications on facades or ceilings. The first phase of the research focuses on the preparation and characterization of the nonwoven structures. On the one hand, nonwoven fabrics are prepared from biodegradable fibers such as flax fiber, and on the other hand, nonwoven fabrics are prepared with fibers from post-consumer textile waste, both of a technical nature such as aramid fibers, or from end-of-life textiles from fashion, such as cotton-polyester blends. In a second phase, the preparation and characterization of the reinforced composite materials is carried out. The compounds are characterized mechanically (with the bending-deformation test), microstructurally (with observations from SEM and BSEM) and finally the thermal and fire resistance properties are evaluated. In a third and final phase of the research, comparisons are established between the different reinforcements, evaluating the reinforcement capacities that each of these textiles give to the cement matrix. From the results, it can be concluded that cementitious composite materials reinforced with the nonwoven fabrics developed in this thesis become a suitable material for its application as a construction material. Despite multiple works related to the recovery of textile waste and its applications in composites have been published, there is limited knowledge about the combination of raw materials that we propose in this project, as well as for its possible applications. In particular, there is also limited knowledge on cement-based composites in which the reinforcement is a nonwoven fabric prepared from biodegradable fibers or recovered from textile waste. In this sense, composites reinforced with textile waste represent a great advance in sustainability for the sector, in addition to offering resistance properties that are highly suitable for this type of construction applications. The results will help to develop new sustainable building materials with a high content of raw materials recovered from waste and that, applied in panels for ventilated facades, floors and roofs or for the reinforcement of masonry, will contribute to improve the energy efficiency of buildings already reduce emissions generated for the construction sector. (Espa&#241;ol) Actualmente existe una preocupaci&#243;n creciente por la sostenibilidad del sector de la construcci&#243;n debido a su gran contribuci&#243;n al cambio clim&#225;tico. Aproximadamente un tercio de las emisiones de di&#243;xido de carbono son producidas por este sector, tanto durante la fase de construcci&#243;n como operativa de edificios. Otro problema ambiental es la abundancia de desechos producidos por los procesos industriales y los productos al final de su vida &#250;til. En este sentido, el uso de m&#225;s materiales de construcci&#243;n sostenibles y, en particular, la reducci&#243;n de la cantidad necesaria de cemento es de gran inter&#233;s. Esta tesis se centra en desarrollar y caracterizar materiales de construcci&#243;n sostenibles a base de cemento reforzados con telas no tejidas biodegradables o bien producidas a partir de fibras recuperadas de residuos textiles, principalmente dise&#241;ados para ser aplicados sobre paneles delgados para su aplicaci&#243;n en fachadas ventiladas, pavimentos y refuerzo de estructuras de mamposter&#237;a, as&#237; como para el desarrollo de paneles s&#225;ndwich multifuncionales para aplicaciones en fachadas o techos. La primera fase de la investigaci&#243;n se centra en la preparaci&#243;n y caracterizaci&#243;n de las estructuras no tejidas. Por un lado, se preparan telas no tejidas a partir de fibras biodegradables como es la fibra de lino, y por otro lado se preparan telas no tejidas con fibras procedentes de residuos textiles post-consumo, tanto de car&#225;cter t&#233;cnico como es la fibra de aramida como procedentes de textiles en desuso del &#225;mbito de la moda, como son las mezclas algod&#243;n-poli&#233;ster. En una segunda fase se realiza la preparaci&#243;n y caracterizaci&#243;n de los materiales compuestos reforzados. Los compuestos se caracterizan mec&#225;nicamente (con el ensayo a flexi&#243;n-deformaci&#243;n), microestructuralmente (con observaciones de SEM y BSEM) y finalmente se eval&#250;an las propiedades t&#233;rmicas y de resistencia al fuego. En una tercera y &#250;ltima fase de la investigaci&#243;n se establecen comparativas entre los diferentes refuerzos, observando las propiedades de resistencia que le otorgan cada uno de estos refuerzos textiles a la matriz de cemento. Se concluye que los materiales compuestos cementantes reforzados con telas no tejidas deviene un material apto para su aplicaci&#243;n como material de construcci&#243;n. A pesar de la existencia de m&#250;ltiples trabajos relacionados con la recuperaci&#243;n de residuos textiles y sus aplicaciones en composites, existe un conocimiento limitado sobre la combinaci&#243;n de las materias primas con residuos particulares que proponemos en este proyecto, as&#237; como para sus posibles aplicaciones. Particularmente, tambi&#233;n hay un conocimiento limitado sobre compuestos a base de cemento en los que el refuerzo es una tela no tejida preparada a partir de fibras biodegradables o recuperadas de desechos textiles. En este sentido, los compuestos reforzados con residuos textiles suponen un gran avance en materia de sostenibilidad para el sector, adem&#225;s de ofrecer propiedades de resistencia muy adecuadas para este tipo de aplicaciones en construcci&#243;n. Los resultados ayudar&#225;n a desarrollar nuevos materiales de construcci&#243;n sostenibles con un alto contenido en materias primas recuperadas de residuos y que, aplicados en paneles para fachadas ventiladas, suelos y cubiertas o para el refuerzo de mamposter&#237;a, contribuir&#225; a mejorar la eficiencia energ&#233;tica de los edificios y a reducir las emisiones generadas para el sector de la construcci&#243;n.</description>
