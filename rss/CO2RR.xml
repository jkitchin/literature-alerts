                Abstract Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), which is driven by electricity generated from renewable energy sources, is a promising technology for sustainably producing carbon&#8208;based chemicals or fuels. Several CO 2 RR catalysts have been explored to date, among which copper&#8208;based electrocatalysts are the most widely known for electrochemical CO 2 RR and are extensively studied for their ability to generate an array of products. Their low selectivity, however, hinders their possibility of being used for practical purposes. In this work, a microwave&#8208;assisted one&#8208;pot synthesized Cu x O/N&#8208;doped carbon demonstrates the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into multiple C 1 products (mainly formate and methanol), with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 95% in 0.10 m KHCO 3 aqueous solution at a moderately low applied potential of &#8722;0.55 V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode). The in&#8208;depth theoretical study reveals the key contribution of pyridinic N&#8208;based N&#8208;doped carbon sites and Cu 2 O clusters in CO 2 adsorption and its subsequent conversion to formate and methanol via an energetically favorable formate pathway. The electrocatalyst continued to demonstrate CO 2 reduction to valuable C 1 products when a simulated flue gas stream containing 15% CO 2 along with 500 ppm SO x and 200 ppm NO x is used as an inlet feed.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emission from the Use Phase of Electric Vehicles in Thailand</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54389/htwy4486</link>
      <description>Thanwadee Chinda, Proceedings of the sliit international conference on engineering and technology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404017627

                Electric vehicle is a solution to reduce global warming, carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, and environmental impact and achieve sustainable development goals. The Thai government planned that 30% of new vehicles produced in Thailand in 2030 would be zero-emission vehicles. With various government support, the number of EVs is expected to increase in the next few years abruptly. With an increased use of EVs, it is expected that the CO2 emission will be reduced. This study develops a system dynamics (SD) model utilizing an SD modelling approach to predict the number of EVs and examine the reduction of CO2 emissions from EVs in the use phase. It focuses on dynamic relationships between variables and is associated with the time-dependent behaviour of controlled systems. The simulation results show a CO2 emission reduction of 15.37 million tonnes in 2030. With continuous promotion of EVs, the amount of CO2 emission reduction is expected to be 37.29 million tonnes in 2036. The sensitivity analysis results reveal that by changing the driving distance from the minimum to maximum distances, only the magnitude of the model changes, while the model behaviour remains the same. This confirms the validity of the developed SD model. It is found that by maximizing the driving distance by 33%, the CO2 emission is further reduced by almost 50%. Moreover, when the government support period is changed to four years, the CO2 emission reduction becomes 19.73 million tonnes, reaching the government target of a 30% reduction in 2030. The Thai government may use the study results to plan for supporting policies to enhance the demand for EVs and achieve the SDGs in the long term. Different policies may be tested to select suitable policies for implementation. Countries with similar EV market statuses may adjust the study results to suit their implementation.

                Abstract Benefiting from the synergism between adjacent bimetallic atoms, in comparison with single atom catalysts, the dual atom catalysts have displayed great potential in electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). However, the further modulation of the electronic structure of dual atom sites to enhance CO 2 RR performance still remains a challenge. Herein, an atomically dispersed oxygen&#8208;bridged Ni 2 N 6 O/NC catalyst with unique Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ni sites is successfully synthesized through the microwave pyrolysis of the supported mixture containing the dinuclear nickel phthalocyanine and glucose on N&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets. Experiments and density functional theory calculation reveal that the Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ni sites can adsorb H + from the KHCO 3 electrolyte to in situ&#8208;form the unique Ni&#8208;OH&#8208;Ni sites without Ni&#9472;Ni bonding interaction, which effectively lowers the energy barrier towards the formation of *COOH from CO 2 . As a result, the Ni 2 N 6 OH/NC catalyst exhibits a 99.4% of CO Faradaic efficiency with a 32.4 mA&#183;cm &#8722;2 of CO partial current density at &#8722;0.7 V versus RHE in H&#8208;cell, much superior to the Ni 2 N 6 /NC with a Ni&#8208;Ni bonding interaction prepared by a similar procedure to that for Ni 2 N 6 O/NC but replacing microwave pyrolysis by a traditional heating process.</description>

      <title>A Step-Change Initiative to Offset the Reduction of CO2 for Greenhouse Gases</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222238-ms</link>
      <description>A. Qasim Rawahi, B. Wafa Al-Jabri, C. Ibrahim AL-Bakri, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404014481

                Abstract Objective and Scope In alignment with the Petroleum Development Oman's PDO commitment to achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, with an interim target of a 50% reduction by 2030, the Company has initiated the "Decarbonation Road Map" aimed at positioning Oman as a leader in clean energy development and GHG emissions reduction. One of the key initiatives contributing to the global goal of reducing GHG emissions is the deployment of Mobile Sewage Treatment Plants (MSTPs) at for camp sites, replacing conventional soak away and septic tanks. Methods, Procedures, Process This project involves the implementation of standalone/mobile STP units, effectively addressing issues related to sewage management, reducing CO2 emissions, minimizing road exposure, and eliminating the need for sewage trucking. Furthermore, in alignment with PDO's dedication to sustainability, the Company has actively participated in the National Initiative for Plantation of 10 million Trees, utilizing Treated Sewage Effluent (TSE) to plant approximately 3,800 trees per location (totaling 95,000 trees across 25 locations). Results, Observations, Conclusions The implementation of this initiative is anticipated to yield numerous benefits, including but not limited to: Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE): The Company's primary focus is on eliminating potential risks associated with traffic exposure and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. Through the comprehensive initiative, the objective is to eliminate instances of non-compliance related to road incidents, sewage overflow, harm to animals and birds due to sewage discharge, as well as violations of pollution standards for isolating underground aquifers. Additionally, efforts will enhance welfare provisions for crews, reinforcing the Company's commitment to their well-being. Furthermore, emphasis on the Company's commitment towards environmental biodiversity.Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Reduction: The initiative places strong emphasis on minimizing CO2 emissions, specifically targeting greenhouse gases. By eliminating vacuum trucks and implementing plantation coverage, a substantial reduction of approximately 97,525 CO2 metric tons per year in CO2 emissions is anticipated. This reduction aligns with the Company's commitment towards environmental sustainability and proactive approach to mitigating climate change impacts.Cost Optimization: In addition to environmental benefits, the initiative offers significant cost advantages. The projected cost reduction is estimated $5.5 million/year as a result of eliminating the need for vacuum trucks, optimizing sewage system construction, operation and maintenance, and avoiding non-productive time during site restoration. Adopting such optimized processes and implementing efficient solutions will result in a streamlined operation, minimizing unnecessary expenses, and enhancing overall cost-effectiveness. Novel/Additive Information Replacing septic and soak away tanks with Mobile STPs shall directly reduce the carbon footprint by address environmental challenges such as sewage overflow, CO2 emissions, and pollution associated with transportation exposure. The initiative not only resolves sewage overflow issues but also contributes to CO2 emission reduction by eliminating sewage trucking and minimizing road exposure, thus reducing the carbon footprint. Moreover, replacing outdated sewage systems mitigates the risk of soil and water contamination, preserving local ecosystems and safeguarding nearby water sources.</description>

      <title>System Dynamics Modeling For Co2 Emission Reduction Through Paper Replacement By Electronic Processes In A Public Institution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.9790/487x-2610171221</link>
      <description>Humberto Trindade, Maur&#237;cio Sperandio, Glauco Oliveira Rodrigues, Dienifer Djustina, Elenara Milena De Cristo, IOSR Journal of Business and Management. 26(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404079801

                Background: The study addresses the importance of reducing CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change, focusing on replacing paper use with electronic processes in a public institution. Paper usage significantly contributes to CO2 emissions, while electronic management can reduce these emissions. The study is a proposal that encouraged the electronic processing of administrative tasks to ensure speed. Decree 8.539/2015 made the electronic processing of documents in federal public administration mandatory. The Judiciary branch was a pioneer in implementing electronic processes in Brazilian public institutions. For this article, the Systems Dynamics (SD) methodology was used, and a simulation model was developed to assess the environmental impact of process automation at the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM). Key results highlighted the reduction of CO2 emissions and cost savings. The implementation of digital processes resulted in a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, and the adoption of electronic processes generated financial savings. Therefore, System Dynamics modeling is a useful tool for institutions to plan scenarios and promote environmental sustainability. The transition to electronic processes in public institutions can bring significant environmental and economic benefits.</description>

      <description>Hasna Oukmi, Badr Chegari, Roland Soun, Ouadia Mouhat, Mohamed Rougui, Mohammed El Ganaoui, Energies. 17(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404039994

                The Cool Roof concept, known for its efficiency in summer due to high temperatures during this period, employs a light coating that covers the roof to prevent the absorption of heat and maintain lower indoor temperatures. This study integrates a chemical component with biomaterials to enhance performance and reduce CO2 emissions. The composition investigated in this research is recognized for its durability and ability to lower outside temperatures, thereby mitigating the urban heat island effect. This experimental study evaluates the sustainability of CoolRoofs in a cold room located in Signes, France. Temperature measurements are conducted from 25 September 2023 to 27 July 2024, both with and without the coating, to assess energy performance and CO2 emissions. The selection of the building type ensures optimal performance in both summer and winter. Results show that the maximum outside and inside surface temperatures for a Cool Roof are 48.7 &#176;C and 25.6 &#176;C, respectively, compared to 72.9 &#176;C and 32.2 &#176;C for an uncoated roof. Additionally, implementing a CoolRoof reduces thermal load through the cold room by 56%, while CO2 emissions can be reduced by up to 27.31 kg CO2/m2 over a 20-year period.

      <title>Mechanism of Water Cut Reduction in CO2 Flooding to Enhance GOR Curve Prediction Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/223049-ms</link>

                Abstract Precise forecasting of Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) curves is crucial for the effective and safe exploitation of reservoirs influenced by CO2 flooding. On a macroscopic level, the GOR curve typically exhibits a rapid rise, while on a microscopic level, it shows significant fluctuations. These characteristics make it challenging for conventional prediction methods to capture these dynamics, resulting in notable deficiencies in existing univariate models in terms of rapid response to changes and anomaly detection. To address the challenges in predicting GOR curves, this study employs impulse response functions and cross-correlation functions to identify the lagged correlation between water cut and GOR curves. Based on these findings, a prediction strategy incorporating water cut constraints is proposed. This approach utilizes a multi-input Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to balance the long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in GOR. The model is trained on well production data from 26 production wells in a CO2 pilot area in Northeast China, capturing monthly production indicators to improve prediction accuracy and enhance early warning capabilities for CO2 breakthrough events. The research results indicate that incorporating water cut as a constraint variable significantly improved the accuracy of GOR curve predictions, particularly enabling predictions 60 days in advance in multi-step forecasting. The model's mean absolute error (MAE) decreased from 260.60 to 172.89, and the root mean square error (RMSE) reduced from 522.87 to 382.15, demonstrating a significant enhancement in the model's prediction accuracy and performance. Incorporating water cut as a constraint variable into the deep learning prediction strategy significantly improves GOR curve trend accuracy and sensitivity to fluctuations. This provides engineers with an early warning tool for CO2 breakthrough events, reducing uncertainty and risk in CO2 injection. Additionally, introducing lagged correlation variables enhances the model's ability to capture complex interactions in time series data, offering valuable insights and methodological references for future productivity prediction research.</description>

                The screening and evaluation of co-control technologies for pollution reduction and carbon mitigation represent a crucial prerequisite for researching pathways toward pollution and carbon reduction within petroleum refining industry. A systematic assessment method for technology synergies in pollution reduction and carbon mitigation remains deficient in China. In this study, we propose a method for evaluating the synergistic effects of technologies in pollution reduction and carbon mitigation in the petroleum refining industry. This model evaluates the synergistic control efficacy of technologies from multiple perspectives, including pollution-carbon synergy, synergistic reduction of pollutant-carbon emissions, cost-benefit analysis, and environmental benefits. The developed methodology is validated through its application to typical petroleum refining technology. The results confirm the synergistic benefits of pollution and carbon reduction through five petroleum refining technologies. With the increase in carbon trading prices, bio-jet fuels (T1) and microalgae carbon sequestration (T5) technologies have greater application potential. This study provides a scientific basis and theoretical support for the realization of collaborative control of carbon pollution in the petroleum refining industry.</description>

                We demonstrate an electrostatic confinement&#8208;induced charge transfer pathway in a supramolecular photocatalyst comprising of an ionic covalent organic framework (COF) and cationic metal complexes. The dynamic electrostatic interactions not only attract cations around the COF to accept photogenerated electrons, but also allows for a retention of homogeneous catalytic characters of complexes, making a subtle balance. Accordingly, the electrostatic confinement effect facilitates the forward electron transfer from a photoexcited COF to cationic Co complex, realizing a remarkable photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Its catalytic efficiency is far superior to the supramolecular counterparts with Van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals or hydrogen bonding interactions. This work presents an insight for enhancing charge transfer in supramolecular systems, and provides an effective approach for construction of highly efficient photocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract While drilling the 12&#8243; section, a water bearing formation is encountered prior to reaching the target gas reservoir formation. This formation is sporadically-charged across the field requiring a KMW up to 21 ppg. This poses major well integrity challenges as it becomes critical to avoid losses in the resulting narrow mud window and ensuring proper cement placement. Inability to predict the mud window makes it impossible to define the drilling strategy to implement. To understand the drilling challenges, in-depth offset wells analysis was performed. Based on mud weights required to drill across the reference formation, the heat-map for historical KMW was created based on confirmed well control events. It was difficult to predict formation-flow potential. Field geomechanics studies was then carried out to correlate the mapping done earlier. Once possibility of encountering abnormally pressured formation is flagged, in order prevent drilling risks such as loss circulation and poor cementing placement, proactive measures such as: Improved influx monitoring, drilling/cementing fluids optimization, liner-and-tieback system implementation, Managed Pressure Drilling/Cementing, optimized casing design were put in place. The integrated approach led to quick influx detection, proper definition of mud window, i.e. Pore Pressure and Fracture Gradient together, helped to prevent the losses, design of fit-for-purpose bridging strategy to ensure full drilling fluid column at all time while avoiding the cost associated with fluid losses. Drilling the section with Managed Pressure Drilling system (MPD) and low mud weight led to achievement of high ROP leading to substantial time saving. The Liner string was run and Managed Pressure Cementing (MPC) was implemented to manage the equivalent circulating density (ECD), avoid losses and ensure good zonal isolation. Overall non-productive time was reduced by 40% as compared to the offset wells in the area. Integrated drilling approach delivers great gains when there is good understanding of the well integrity challenges and solutions are tailored to solve identified problems.</description>

      <title>Driving High Performance and Decarbonizing Well Construction Carbon Dioxide CO2 Footprint: A Petroleum Development Oman PDO Case Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/223023-ms</link>

                Abstract Petroleum Development Oman PDO has set an ambitious target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. In alignment with this goal, this paper showcases how high performance can be achieved while reducing the carbon footprint of well construction. Petroleum Development Oman PDO achieves high performance through a series of continuous improvement initiatives, known as the "Well Staircase." These initiatives encompass well design optimization, the adoption of new technologies, operational efficiency enhancements, and cementing design optimization. A comprehensive value creation workshop, involving all stakeholders, was conducted to consolidate these initiatives. Furthermore, this workshop quantified the planned cost savings and time reductions. To operationalize Petroleum Development Oman PDO's net-zero emissions aspiration, a new dimension was introduced to these key initiatives - a reduction in Carbon Dioxide CO2 emissions. Illustrative examples of these initiatives include slimming the well design in the A-field, resulting in an 11% reduction in costs per well, a saving of 9.8 days, and a decrease in CO2 emissions by 245 tonnes. Replacing Motorized Reamers MSRs yielded a 1% reduction in well costs and a 0.4-tonne reduction in CO2 emissions due to transportation. The optimized slurry formulation led to a 15-tonne reduction in CO2 emissions per well. The elimination of round trips by employing a risk-assessed hole condition approach resulted in a cost saving of 1.6% per well, a time saving of 2.5 days, and a reduction in CO2 emissions by 62 tonnes. This innovative approach demonstrates how high performance can be achieved while simultaneously decarbonizing well construction, providing valuable insights and practical strategies for the industry's journey toward a sustainable future.</description>

      <title>Integrated Carbon Dioxide Capture by Amines and Conversion to Methane on Single-Atom Nickel Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c09744</link>

                Direct electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture species, i.e., carbamate and (bi)carbonate, can be promising for CO2 capture and conversion from point-source, where the energetically demanding stripping step is bypassed. Here, we describe a class of atomically dispersed nickel (Ni) catalysts electrodeposited on various electrode surfaces that are shown to directly convert captured CO2 to methane (CH4). A detailed study employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electron microscopy (EM) indicate that highly dispersed Ni atoms are uniquely active for converting capture species to CH4, and the activity of single-atom Ni is confirmed using control experiments with a molecularly defined Ni phthalocyanine catalyst supported on carbon nanotubes. Comparing the kinetics of various capture solutions obtained from hydroxide, ammonia, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines provide evidence that carbamate, rather than (bi)carbonate and/or dissolved CO2, is primarily responsible for CH4 production. This conclusion is supported by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of capture solutions as well as control experiments comparing reaction selectivity with and without CO2 purging. These findings are understood with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations showing that single-atom nickel (Ni) dispersed on gold (Au) is active for the direct reduction of carbamate, producing CH4 as the primary product. This is the first example of direct electrochemical conversion of carbamate to CH4, and the mechanism of this process provides new insight on the potential for integrated capture and conversion of CO2 directly to hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>Optimum Planning of Carbon Capture and Storage Network Using Goal Programming</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12112463</link>

                Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical technology used for mitigating climate change by capturing carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources and storing them underground to prevent their release into the atmosphere. Despite its potential, optimizing CCS systems for cost-effectiveness and efficiency improvement remains a significant challenge. In this paper, the optimization of CCS systems through the development and application of two mathematical optimization techniques is introduced. The first technique is based on using a superstructure optimization model, while the second technique relies on applying a goal programming optimization model. These models were solved using LINGO software version API 14.0.5099.166 to enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of CCS systems. The first model, seeking to maximize the exchange of CO2 flowrate from sources to sinks, achieved a CO2 capture rate of 93.36% with an annual total cost of USD 1.175 billion. The second model introduced a novel mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) approach for multi-objective optimization, targeting the minimization of total system cost, alternative storage, and unutilized storage while maximizing CO2 load exchange. The application of the second model, when prioritized to maximize CO2 flowrate exchange using the goal programming technique, resulted in a cost reduction of 36.46% and a CO2 capture rate of 75.87%. In contrast, when the second model prioritized minimizing the total annual cost, a 48% cost reduction was achieved, and the CO2 capture rate was decreased by 68.37%. A comparison of the two models&#8217; results is presented. The results showed that the second model, with the priority of maximizing CO2 capture, provides the best economic&#8211;environmental objective balance, which offers notable cost reductions while keeping an efficient CO2 capture rate. This study highlights the potential of advanced mathematical modeling in increasing the feasibility of CCS as one of the very important strategies of mitigating climate change and reducing global warming.</description>

      <title>The challenge of reducing diesel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions: A perspective on the use of hydrogen in mining trucks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.37190/msc243101</link>
      <description>Robson Lage Figueiredo, Carlos A. Ortiz, Jos&#233; Margarida da Silva, Mining Science. 31(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404116115

                In mining, the traditional system of operation relies on equipment that consumes large amounts of energy. In mine operations, trucks are widely used due to their flexibility, loading ca-pacity, and adaptability to various terrain conditions. However, they have high diesel oil consump-tion and high emission rates of smoke, particulate matter, and mainly carbon gas from diesel en-gines. This article offers a comprehensive view on the effect of hydrogen added to the diesel engine in the search for renewable energy alternatives that are in tune with the reduction of the environ-mental impact arising from the use of petroleum-derived fuels. The article presents an overview about the challenges in reducing the diesel fuel consumption of trucks employed in mining. It ap-proaches the effect of controlled hydrogen addition on diesel engine performance, consumption reduction, and greenhouse gas emissions. Followed by a discussion of the main technologies used to manufacture hydrogen and their production costs. The results of the studies show that hydrogen is a promising alternative for reducing operational, energy, and emissions costs, mainly carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO), but it faces barriers in production, storage, and supply costs. We highlight the &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221;, carbon-free, which contributes to the decarbonization process in mines, as open pit or underground ones.</description>

                To limit the impacts of climate change, the carbon dioxide CO2 emissions (CE) correlated with the energy sector must be decreased. Reduction of CE will have a positive effect on the atmosphere by avoiding the adverse impact of global warming. To attain an eco-environment, the initial energy resource needs to move from traditional fossil fuels to unpolluted renewable energy (RE). Thus, enhancing the utilization of RE actively decreases air pollution and adds secure sustainable energy allocation to ensure future energy needs. Integrating sources of RE not only drops CE but also decreases fuel consumption, leading to significant economic savings. This paper presents the transition of global energy that will have a largely positive impact on the growth and future stability of economies with cost-effective and more sustainable all over the world. Significant reductions can be accomplished by using applicable policies and technologies. In the context of current discussions about climate change and the reduction of CE, this paper critically analyses some policies, technologies, and commonly discussed solutions. Technologies like digital twin (DT), transfer learning (TL), Edge Computing (EC), Distributed Computing (DC), and some other technologies with their work for the reduction of CE are discussed thoroughly in this paper. The given techniques in this survey paper present the best optimal solutions for CE reduction.</description>

      <title>The Recycling of Lithium from LiFePO4 Batteries into Li2CO3 and Its Use as a CO2 Absorber in Hydrogen Purification</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/cleantechnol6040072</link>

                The growing adoption of lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries in electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy systems has intensified the need for sustainable management at the end of their life cycle. This study introduces an innovative method for recycling lithium from spent LiFePO4 batteries and repurposing the recovered lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) as a carbon dioxide (CO2) absorber. The recycling process involves dismantling battery packs, separating active materials, and chemically treating the cathode to extract lithium ions, which produces Li2CO3. The efficiency of lithium recovery is influenced by factors such as leaching temperature, acid concentration, and reaction time. Once recovered, Li2CO3 can be utilized for CO2 capture in hydrogen purification processes, reacting with CO2 to form lithium bicarbonate (LiHCO3). This reaction, which is highly effective in aqueous solutions, can be applied in industrial settings to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. The LiHCO3 can then be thermally decomposed to regenerate Li2CO3, creating a cyclic and sustainable use of the material. This dual-purpose process not only addresses the environmental impact of LiFePO4 battery disposal but also contributes to CO2 reduction, aligning with global climate goals. Utilizing recycled Li2CO3 decreases the demand for virgin lithium extraction, supporting a circular economy. Furthermore, integrating Li2CO3-based CO2 capture systems into existing industrial infrastructure provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for lowering carbon footprints while securing a continuous supply of lithium for future battery production. Future research should focus on optimizing lithium recovery methods, improving the efficiency of CO2 capture, and exploring synergies with other waste management and carbon capture technologies. This comprehensive strategy underscores the potential of lithium recycling to address both resource conservation and environmental protection challenges.</description>

                Climate change has become a pressing concern for humanity in the contemporary era. Scientists believe that the acceleration of global warming and climate change is directly linked to the rising concentration of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). This has become a challenge for many developing countries. The construction industry is one of the sectors that significantly contributed to heightened carbon emissions into the environment. Road construction involves various activities and processes that release substantial amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. Addressing these issues are crucial for mitigating the adverse effects of climate change and fostering sustainable development. The development of road infrastructure generates CO2 emissions across various stages. Notably, the construction stage is responsible for a significant portion of these emissions. Despite this, research efforts in Sri Lanka have primarily focused on reducing CO2 emissions in building construction projects, with limited attention to strategies specifically targeting road construction projects. The construction phase of road development has thus far been overlooked in terms of CO2 emission reduction strategies. Consequently, this study seeks to raise awareness among academics, professionals, and practitioners involved in road development projects about the factors influencing CO2 emissions during the road construction phase. The objectives of this study are to examine the factors affecting CO2 emissions during road construction development, identify the activities and processes contributing to CO2 emissions during the construction phase of road projects, explore existing sustainable strategies used in road construction to mitigate CO2 emissions, and assess their applicability to the Sri Lankan Road construction sector. A systematic literature review was conducted to achieve these objectives, selecting the fifty-six most relevant past research studies.

      <title>Pathway of reducing CO2 emission and harmful exhaust gases in transport by using electric buses-the example of Belgrade</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2298/tsci240713246m</link>
      <description>Slobodan Mi&#353;anovi&#263;, Predrag &#381;ivanovi&#263;, Katarina Stojanovi&#263;, Svetozar Sofijanic, Thermal Science. None(00)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404069426

                The buses have an irreplaceable role in the public transport system, regardless of city size. Buses powered by internal combustion engines (diesel, CNG) are still the most common concept of city buses, but in the last few years, the use of fully electric buses (E-buses) has been growing. One of the reasons for the increasing use of electric buses is their environmental advantages over conventional buses: zero emissions at the local level (Tank-To-Wheel) emission, more favourable carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions at the regional or national level (Well-To-Wheel), and higher energy efficiency. The EKO1 line (Vukov Spomenik-Belvil) has operated in Belgrade since 2016, with five full electric buses. The paper will present the environmental aspects of using electric buses on line EKO1 compared to diesel and CNG buses. The environmental aspects of E-buses were researched through the effects of reducing the emission of harmful exhaust gases caused by eliminating the use of diesel-powered or CNG-powered buses and introducing E-buses. Within the ecological suitability of the using E-buses, the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) that occurs indirectly during electricity production was researched and a comparison was made with the emissions of CO2 caused by the combustion of diesel fuel and CNG in buses with conventional propulsion. The paper also examined the energy efficiency of buses with different drive systems on the line EKO1, based on the analyzed energy consumption. As a result of the analysis, the introduction of electric buses on the EKO1 line was justified from the point of view of improving the environment through the reduction of harmful gas emissions and decarbonization as well as better energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Utilization of Innovative CO2 Swelling Elastomeric Cement Integrity Sleeve as a Novel Well Integrity Enhancement Solution for Underground CO2 Storage Wells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222407-ms</link>
      <description>Andr&#233;s F. Osorio, A. Vliegenthart, A. Vos, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404014315

                Abstract As the world aims to mitigate the climate-changing effects of global warming, intergovernmental regulatory bodies increasingly focus on greenhouse-gas emission reduction by implementing environmental policies to phase down fossil-fuel utilization and develop sustainable energy sources as part of global energy transition efforts. While various greenhouse gasses are emitted from a wide range of natural and artificial sources, human-produced carbon dioxide (CO2) is the primary driver of climate change as it accounts for approximately 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions (Olivier et al, 2020). Efforts to reduce greenhouse gas pollution from the atmosphere have led to significant advancements in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies, which aim to inject CO2 in underground storage wells with non-permeable formations capable of safe and permanent downhole containment. Furthermore, CCS is widely regarded as one of the most effective ways to mitigate climate change as recent studies estimate it could reduce CO2 emissions by 20% before the year 2050 (Elkatatny, 2021). The planning and execution of a comprehensive CCS well integrity strategy is considerably more complex than conventional well integrity practices commonly found in the oil and gas industry. The hydration of supercritical CO2 leads to multiple carbonation reactions producing elevated concentrations of carbonic acid (H2CO3), which can severely degrade a cement barrier in radial direction and cause longitudinal cement defects. Concurrently, cyclic pressure and temperature fluctuations during long-term CO2 injection can compromise casing-to-cement bond, causing a potential leak path through micro annuli. These factors may lead to gas migration and subsequent Sustained Annular Pressure (SAP) buildup on surface, increasing the risk of direct CO2 leakage into the atmosphere. An innovative CO2 Elastomeric Cement Integrity Sleeve (C-ECIS) has been developed specifically for the purpose of SAP prevention and well integrity optimization in CO2 storage wells. Distinctly different to a swellable packer, the C-ECIS was designed as a slip-on seal for external installation onto downhole tubulars. It is comprised of a novel swellable elastomer which utilizes CO2 as the primary swelling fluid medium for its volumetric expansion. It permanently swells and seals a casing-to-cement microannular flow path immediately upon direct exposure to gas migration within the casing-to-cement microannulus. The C-ECIS is a unique technological innovation with the potential to transform the industry's current approach to CCS well integrity planning due to its simplicity and reliability. This publication provides an in-depth overview of the technology, its qualification process, and current field implementation status.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Enhancing the CO2 Sequestration Volumetric Capacity for CCS Project by Re-Injection of Produced Brine</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222251-ms</link>

                Abstract Objectives/Scope Reducing anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is crucial for mitigating climate change. CO2 Capture and Sequestration (CCS) is considered one of the most promising options for carbon reduction. It involves the injection of CO2 into the structural reservoirs in deep, permeable geologic formations. The effectiveness of CCS relies heavily on the geological and petrophysical properties of the storage reservoir. It has been studied that some percentage of injected supercritical CO2 is securely trapped underground via two major trapping mechanisms: physical trapping, and geochemical trapping. Physical trapping mechanisms include structural (hydrostratigraphic) trapping, residual (capillary) trapping, and sorption trapping. The physical trapping is relatively fixed for a given storage reservoir due to its geological parameters. The geochemical trapping mechanism occurs through solubility trapping and mineral trapping. It is very well known that solubility trapping includes slow diffusion in the aqueous phase and convective processes. In the case of mineral trapping, the process is over a much longer period, and it is one of the slowest mechanisms. Methods, Procedures, and Process This study employed a novel approach to enhance CO2 sequestration rates by injecting CO2 and brine produced from the same reservoir simultaneously. The solubility trapping occurs because of the dissolution of CO2 in the brine, leading to dense CO2-saturated brine. The main rate-limiting step in solubility trapping is the CO2 migration in brine which happens through diffusion and is very well known to be a slow process. To address this, the study proposed enhancing the mixing between injected CO2 and brine during the injection phase while maintaining reservoir pressure. Results, Observations, Conclusions Utilizing a systematic numerical model, the study identified an optimal approach involving a combination of CO2 and brine injection with brine production based on reservoir pressure transients. This strategy significantly enhanced CO2 injection rates, leading to a potential increase in CO2 sequestration capacity throughout the injection and storage campaign. Thus, with this innovative approach and with the use of existing CCS reservoir and existing facilities we achieved 10% to 30% more CO2 sequestration capacity through enhanced solubility trapping as well as some increment in mineral trapping. Novel/Additive Information A novel approach was employed to enhance CO2 sequestration rates by injecting CO2 and brine produced from the same reservoir simultaneously. This simulation exercise provides guidelines on enhanced reservoir management to increase CO2 sequestration rates and therefore volumes in a reservoir by managing the production and disposal of water. These novel guidelines enable operators to increase the economic value and ROI (Return on Investment) on such CSS projects.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Carbon-Dioxide Emissions of Diesel and LNG Heavy-Duty Trucks in Test Track Environment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/cleantechnol6040070</link>

                Environmental protection and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are getting increasingly high priority in the area of mobility. Several regulations, goals and projects have been published in recent years that clearly encourage the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, the adoption of green alternatives and the use of renewable energy sources. The study compares CO2 emissions between conventional diesel and liquefied natural gas (LNG) heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs), and furthermore investigates the main influencing factors of GHG emissions. This study was carried out in a test&#8211;track environment, which supported the perfect reproducibility of the tests with minimum external influencing factors, allowing different types of measurements. At the results level, our primary objective was to collect and evaluate consumption and emission values using statistical methods, in terms of correlations, relationships and impact assessment. In this research, we recorded CO2 and pollutant emission values indirectly via the fleet management system (FMS) using controller area network (CAN) messages. Correlation, regression and statistical analyses were used to investigate the factors influencing fuel consumption and emissions. Our scientific work is a unique study in the field of HDVs, as the measurements were performed on the test track level, which provide accuracy for emission differences. The results of the project clearly show that gas technology can contribute to reducing GHG emissions of HDVs, and LNG provides a reliable alternative way forward for long-distance transportation, especially in areas of Europe where filling stations are already available.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of nanoparticle additives in reducing emissions in compression ignition engine</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.47264/idea.ajset/3.1.4</link>
      <description>Muhammad Siddique Baloch, Zohaib Khan, Sher Muhammad Ghoto, Sajjad Bhangwar, Arif Ali Rind, Irfan Gul, Muhammad Ramzan Luhur, Deleted Journal. 3(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404103789

                The paper discusses the growing environmental issues caused by vehicle emissions, leading many countries to tighten their emission standards to reduce the harmful gases released by motor vehicles. This is especially important as urbanization has increased, leading to more consumption of petroleum products. As a result, there is a growing need for cleaner, more sustainable fuel alternatives. Biodiesel has been recognized as a potential solution since it is renewable, non-toxic, and less environmentally harmful than traditional diesel. The study in question explores how adding biodiesel and nanoparticles affects diesel engine performance, particularly in terms of noise and particulate matter emissions (small particles of pollution). The research was carried out using a compression ignition engine (like those found in diesel vehicles) under constant RPM (revolutions per minute) and variable loads (changes in engine stress or power requirements). The results showed that when biodiesel was blended with nanoparticles and used as fuel, there was a noticeable reduction in noise levels, carbon dioxide (CO2), and particulate matter emissions compared to regular diesel. This suggests that biodiesel, especially when enhanced with nanoparticles, can effectively lower the harmful effects of diesel engines on the environment, offering a greener and quieter alternative.</description>

      <title>Decarbonization and Successful Zonal Isolation of a Challenging Well Using a High-Performance Low-Carbon Emission System Containing Less than 30% Portland Mass</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/221838-ms</link>

                Abstract The implementation of a novel technology that reduced Portland cement content by up to 70% was pumped in a complex 9 5/8-in. casing section of an offshore well, which resulted in a significant reduction to carbon footprint. As the oil and gas industry faces the challenges of decarbonization, one of the focus areas that remains is carbon emissions generated by the cement industry. The innovative and tailored system described in this study is designed to deliver high performance at a lower density than conventional systems for improved barrier dependability. Proven laboratory results show that the system enables higher compressive strength at a lower density, increases ductility, and reduces permeability and corrosion resistance. The main engineering and operational advantage of this system is its capability for deployment without the requirement for specialized or additional equipment, which provides an operationally efficient and sustainable barrier. The primary challenge cementing this section was to reduce the equivalent circulating density (ECD) caused by the elevated risk of losses predicted by offset wells. This required the use of a specialized low-density slurry system with durable mechanical properties. Another challenge was to lower carbon emissions associated with large slurry volumes because conventional high-Portland content cement systems do not align with sustainability goals. Modern technology was applied, and the well was successfully delivered with all achieved objectives. This case demonstrated that sustainable technology is not only efficient to reduce carbon footprint, but also to successfully achieve zonal isolation without downgrading the final cement quality compared to conventional cement systems. Cement production accounts for approximately 8% of global anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions annually (Abdelaal et al.). The benefits of the application of this innovative technology in future wells are discussed, which can help reduce carbon footprint while slurry performance to achieve the zonal isolation.</description>

                This study explores carbon dioxide enrichment in anaerobic digestion to boost biomethane production and assess degradation kinetics and methanogenic pathway evolution. Carbon dioxide enrichment was found to improve inoculum digestion, supplying additional energy for methanogenic archaea. The methane yield of blank inocula increased by 53 % to 77 % after carbon dioxide enrichment. Although further digestion of inoculum residues took longer, rapid adaptation led to an increased methane production rate that surpassed the lag phase. No antagonistic effects were observed with carbon dioxide enrichment after applying the feedstocks. Increased methane production, along with a significant reduction in chemical oxygen demand, confirms the impact of carbon dioxide enrichment on inoculum digestion. Isotope analysis showed an increase in &#948;</description>

      <title>Bioclimatic criteria in the AMOF building to reduce the emission of Carbon Dioxide (CO&#8322;) - Lima - Peru 2021</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.33413/eau.2024.358</link>

                This research aims to analyze the influence of the application of bioclimatic criteria in buildings to obtain integral well-being, energy efficiency and reduction of carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) to the environment. The growing trend for the use of sun-exposed glass in buildings, which causes the greenhouse effect, increases the interior temperature of the building and causes glare, promoting artificial cooling by inefficiently using energy; heating a room naturally and then cooling it artificially is a bad practice and stimulates the closing of the curtains, which causes the lighting of luminaires; with which the building emits carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) to the environment, contributing to global warming. It has been developed, with a methodological approach based on the principles of bioclimatic architecture, the analysis of the variables that allow to study this influence, in the office buildings in Miraflores (Lima, Peru), considering the AMOF building under adverse thermal and light conditions. With the results obtained, it is verified that the solution with solar geometry proposed for the AMOF building solves problems of thermal wellbeing, lighting and decreases the emission of carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) by 74.07 %. Therefore, it is concluded, that these considerations that were not regarded, influence the conditions of habitability and well-being of users, making the window the weakest point of the building to achieve human well-being, energy efficiency and reduction of pollution to the environment.</description>

                Abstract The energy industry has been taking transformative actions to achieve sustainable growth. Specifically, hydraulic fracturing and associated activities are known to be emissions intensive. The objective here is to develop a digital tool that enables quick, efficient, error-free carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions footprint assessments for various job types. The workflows implemented in the tool cover different phases in the intervention and stimulation life cycle of a well. The application's architecture is composed of generic modular assessments, such as resource utilization, site execution, and post-job activities. The user experience focuses on simple domain workflows in which complex processes are embedded to automate the corresponding emissions calculations. Detailed emissions factors for different fuel types are utilized from US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data. The engine first identifies the baseline fuel consumption related to product transportation, equipment mobilization and demobilization, execution at wellsite, and related well cleanup or flaring. The baseline uses historical consumption data, but it goes through a calibration loop based on real-time consumption data tracking. With the emissions factors and fuel efficiency, the second step of the engine is to calculate the CO2 emissions related to the fuel quantity and type. The tool incorporates eight different fuel types and multiple publicly available gas compositions from various basins. The application organically integrates with expansive master data systems such as fluid, proppant, and equipment databases. Moreover, users can seamlessly import design details in one click from other stimulation and intervention design software. Multiple workflows can then be generated to sensitize fluid volume, proppant mass, job type, fuel type, technologies, digital innovations, etc. The current interface captures detailed workflows for conventional and unconventional operations in land and offshore environments. It also supports utilization of an electric fleet. With this digital solution, we are well positioned to (1) accelerate the decarbonizing initiative and (2) position new technology portfolios to transition to cleaner operations. Current implementation showed the impact of technologies such as channel fracturing, retarded acid systems, degradable chemistry, and various predictive models and is positioned to enable smart strategies by integrating sustainability assessment and metrics to drive business growth. Real cases from some geographies show enablement of 20 to 30% emissions reduction. This novel effort is now extended to collaborate with engineering and supply chain teams for real-time measurements, post-job actual emissions calibration, and embodied carbon of material to measure accurately the path to net zero.</description>

                The use of non-fired materials with additives of vegetable waste instead of traditional building ceramics reduces the energy input and the carbon footprint in the construction sector. This applies to one- and two-story buildings due to the lower load-bearing capacity of non-fired bricks. A possibility for substitution of the fired ceramics with non-fired clay bricks with additives of straw at the building of the walls of a single-family house is analyzed. The subsequent reductions of the embodied energy, carbon dioxide, and thermal losses of the buildings are determined.</description>

      <title>Reforming Natural Gas for CO2 Pre-Combustion Capture in Trinary Cycle Power Plant</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17225544</link>
      <description>Nikolay Rogalev, Andrey Rogalev, Vladimir Kindra, Olga Zlyvko, Dmitry Kovalev, Energies. 17(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404111871

                Today, most of the world&#8217;s electric energy is generated by burning hydrocarbon fuels, which causes significant emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere by thermal power plants. In world practice, flue gas cleaning systems for removing nitrogen oxides, sulfur, and ash are successfully used at power facilities but reducing carbon dioxide emissions at thermal power plants is still difficult for technical and economic reasons. Thus, the introduction of carbon dioxide capture systems at modern power plants is accompanied by a decrease in net efficiency by 8&#8211;12%, which determines the high relevance of developing methods for increasing the energy efficiency of modern environmentally friendly power units. This paper presents the results of the development and study of the process flow charts of binary and trinary combined-cycle gas turbines with minimal emissions of harmful substances into the atmosphere. This research revealed that the net efficiency rate of a binary CCGT with integrated post-combustion technology capture is 39.10%; for a binary CCGT with integrated pre-combustion technology capture it is 40.26%; a trinary CCGT with integrated post-combustion technology capture is 40.35%; and for a trinary combined-cycle gas turbine with integrated pre-combustion technology capture it is 41.62%. The highest efficiency of a trinary CCGT with integrated pre-combustion technology capture is due to a reduction in the energy costs for carbon dioxide capture by 5.67 MW&#8212;compared to combined-cycle plants with integrated post-combustion technology capture&#8212;as well as an increase in the efficiency of the steam&#8211;water circuit of the combined-cycle plant by 3.09% relative to binary cycles.</description>

                &lt;div class="section abstract"&gt;&lt;div class="htmlview paragraph"&gt;With all the environmental concern of diesel fuelled vehicle, it is a challenge to phase out them completely specifically from Heavy duty application. Most pragmatic solution lies in solutions which improves the fuel economy and reduce the carbon emission of existing diesel fuelled vehicle fleet and retain the economic feasibility offered by present diesel fuelled vehicle fleets. With implementation of Bharat Stage IV (BS VI) emission norms across country from April 2020, supply of BS VI complaint diesel fuel started and BS VI complaint vehicles with upgraded engine technologies and after treatment devices started to come which made present vehicle fleets heterogeneous with substantive number of BS IV vehicle. Beside improvement of engine technologies, existing BS IV vehicle fleet performance can be enhanced through improved fuel and lubricants solutions. The present research work is a step towards improving the fuel economy of existing BS IV diesel vehicles through the intervention of differentiated diesel fuel and dedicated state of the art lubricants combinations.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="htmlview paragraph"&gt;Developed through modification &amp;amp; up-gradation of BS VI diesel fuel, Differentiated Diesel fuel is having excellent injector cleaning properties, improved combustion, low soot formation etc which intern improve the combustion result in fuel economy improvement and reduce carbon emissions. Further, efforts were made to comprehensively review the lubricant requirement of vehicle. Green combo lubricants have been designed &amp;amp; developed with state-of-the-art lubricants combination comprising engine oil, transmission oil and axle oil which reduce the friction from engine and drivelines and results in further fuel economy benefit. To evaluate the actual fuel economy improvement and emission reduction credentials, comprehensive field trials of Differentiated Diesel and Green Combo lubricants were undertaken in fleet of heavy-duty diesel buses deputed at state transport. State transport was selected due to availability of BS IV complaint diesel fuelled buses of varied vintage from 50,000 km to 200,000 km and nearby vicinity to have better field trial supervision. Field trials were designed in such a way that combined effect of Differentiated Diesel and Green Combo Lubricants and then effect of Green Combo lubricants alone can be evaluated. Fleet of buses were charged with Green Combo lubricants after proper flushing and put new engine oil filter. After charging the Green Combo lubricants, buses were fuelled with Differentiated Diesel and sent to their routine routes for actual running for evaluating the combined effect of differentiated diesel and Green Combo lubricants for initial field trials and buses covered in the range of 25,000 km to 40,000 km each. Afterwards, field trial buses were fuelled with normal BS VI diesel and completed the field trials for evaluation the effect of Green Combo lubricants only. Used engine oil samples and idle emissions through portable emission measurement system as per field trial protocol were taken during the field trials.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="htmlview paragraph"&gt;120,000 km field trials were successfully completed, and it demonstrated that Differentiated Diesel and Green Combo Lubricant together improved the fuel economy by 8% - 9% and emission reduction in Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), and Total Hydrocarbon (THC) are 4.5%, 10%, 4% and 5 % respectively. Green Combo lubricants alone improved the fuel economy by 4% - 5%. Used engine oil analysis confirmed the satisfactory performance of Green Combo lubricants during field trials. Based on theoretical assessment of implementation of this combination together at throughout state transport leads to saving of ~ 350 Kilolitre's (KL) Diesel annually and thus ~ 925 Tonne CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; annually which shows the immense potential of saving the precious diesel fuel and reduced the carbon emission.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Cobalt Phosphide Decorating Metallic Cobalt With a Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Carbon Nano&#8208;Shell Surpasses Platinum Group Metals for Oxygen Electrocatalysis Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/bte2.20240029</link>
      <description>Muhammad Tahir, Muhammad Asim Farid, Elvin Aliyev, Zhen&#8208;Feng Huang, Ji&#8208;Jun Zou, Shangfeng Du, Battery energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404117598

                ABSTRACT It has been a long&#8208;standing challenge to cultivate capable and resilient oxygen electrocatalysts with higher activity, low price, and long lifetime to replace the commonly used platinum group metals, i.e., Pt for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and RuO 2 /IrO 2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This work presents a promising approach to address the challenges associated with oxygen electrocatalysis by introducing a cobalt phosphide/metallic cobalt (Co 2 P/Co) core wrapped in a nitrogen&#8208;doped conductive carbon (CN) nano&#8208;shell, demonstrated as Co 2 P/Co@NC. The strong chemical bonding between metallic cobalt and phosphorus, nitrogen and conductive carbon contributes to the enhanced conductivity and stability of the electrocatalyst. The nitrogen doping in the carbon shell provides additional Co&#8211;N active sites, which are crucial for ORR activity. Co 2 P/Co@NC demonstrates promising activity and stability compared to noble metals such as Pt for ORR in an alkaline medium. This suggests its potential as a cost&#8208;effective alternative to Pt&#8208;based catalysts. Further, due to factors such as strong cobalt&#8208;phosphide bonding, high cobalt oxidation states and excellent conductivity of the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon shell, the Co 2 P/Co@NC outperforms noble metal oxides like iridium dioxide (IrO 2 ) and ruthenium dioxide (RuO 2 ) for OER. Co 2 P/Co@NC exhibits a low potential difference of 0.63 V, which is among the lowest reported for bifunctional electrocatalysts capable of both ORR and OER. Overall, the described strategy offers a promising avenue for developing efficient, low&#8208;cost and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen reactions, which are crucial for various electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies, such as fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries.</description>

      <title>Climate and political effects on agriculture: Empirical evidence from SSA</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ise3.98</link>
      <description>Defaru Adugna Feye, Amsalu Bedemo, Shallu Sehgal Mukesh Kumar, International Studies of Economics. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404087771

                Abstract The most of Sub&#8208;Saharan African (SSA) countries have been affected by climate change and food insecurity problems due to the reduction of production and productivity of cereal crops in the continent. The purpose of this research was to examine the short&#8208;run and long&#8208;run effects of climate change on agricultural productivity in 24 selected SSA countries. In the study, a systematic Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) Model was used with recent data from 24 SSA countries from 2001 to 2020. The panel regression result revealed that temperature and precipitation showed positive significant effects whereas carbon dioxide emission had negatively influenced the cereal crop productivity in the region. Specifically, the empirical result indicates that a one percent increase in precipitation increases cereal crop productivity by 0.27%. The empirical result of the GMM model revealed that political stability, temperature, GDP per capita, trade openness, carbon dioxide emission, fertilizer consumption, and precipitation have both short&#8208;run and long&#8208;run effects, while precipitation has only a short&#8208;run effect on agricultural productivity in the study area. A key implication of this work is the realization of the lagging effects of climate change in determining cereal crop production and productivity. This study was unable to include all SSA countries because the excluded countries did not have sufficient data on the selected variables in the study. Hence, adopting high&#8208;temperature and drought&#8208;resistant types of enhanced cereal crops is advised to combat the negative effects of climate change in the study area.</description>

                Abstract To address the bottle&#8208;neck carbon&#8208;carbon coupling issue during electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (eCO 2 RR) to multicarbon (C 2+ ) products, this work develops an anion&#8208;directed strategy (Cl &#8722; , NO 3 &#8722; , and SO 4 2&#8722; ) to regulate interatomic distance of Cu diatoms. In comparison to pristine Cu (with a typical Cu&#8208;Cu distance of 2.53 &#8491;), Cu&#8208;boroimidazole frameworks (BIF)/SO 4 , NO 3 , and Cl material shows elongated diatomic distance of 3.90 &#8491;, 4.21 &#8491;, and 3.30 &#8491;, respectively. Among them, the Cu&#8208;BIF/Cl exhibits an outstanding eCO 2 RR performance with a Faradaic efficiency of 72.12% for C 2+ products and an industrial&#8208;level current density of 539.0 mA cm &#8722;2 at &#8722;1.75 V versus RHE. Significantly, according to theoretical and in situ experimental investigation, the highly electronegative Cl &#8722; ion lifts d&#8208;band center of Cu sites of Cu&#8208;BIF/Cl, facilitating *CO adsorption with a low Gibbs free energy and its later dimerization overcoming a small energy barrier. In addition, this strategy to manipulate interatomic distance for diatomic catalysts, can also be adaptable to other reactions involving intermediate coupling and following the Langmuir&#8208;Hinshelwood mechanism, such as carbon&#8208;nitrogen coupling, nitrogen&#8208;nitrogen coupling, etc.</description>

      <title>Addressing Climate Change: The Role of Agriculture in Greenhouse Gas Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.9734/arja/2024/v17i4581</link>
      <description>Kishore S. M, Shanker Raj Barsila, D. Kavya, K. Vishnu Priya Kathula, K. Aruna, V S Abhishek, Asian Research Journal of Agriculture. 17(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404113415

                Agriculture is a cornerstone of global food security, which is significantly affected by climate change, primarily driven by human activities that increase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Accounting for approximately 13% of global anthropogenic GHG emissions, agricultural practices-such as livestock rearing, rice cultivation and synthetic fertilizer use which contribute substantially to global warming. Emissions from nitrous oxide (N&#8322;O), methane (CH&#8324;) and carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) exacerbate this issue, with N&#8322;O being particularly concerning due to its high global warming potential. Mitigation strategies within the agricultural sector are essential, including improved nutrient management, the use of nitrification inhibitors and innovative fertilizer application technologies. Organic farming demonstrates lower N&#8322;O emissions compared to conventional practices, emphasizing the importance of sustainable agricultural methods. Additionally, conservation tillage and practices like zero-tillage help reduce CO&#8322; emissions by minimizing soil disturbance and enhancing carbon sequestration. Biochar application further supports soil health and GHG reduction by enhancing carbon storage. To mitigate methane emissions from rice fields, reduced tillage and the introduction of electron acceptors can effectively inhibit methanogenesis. As CO&#8322; constitutes about 72% of total GHG emissions, agricultural practices that increase soil organic carbon (SOC) are critical for effective carbon sequestration. Overall, the agricultural sector holds significant potential for GHG mitigation, with studies suggesting that 89% of the mitigation potential can be achieved through carbon sequestration. Therefore, adopting these strategies is crucial not only for reducing emissions but also for ensuring sustainable agricultural productivity in the face of climate change challenges.</description>

                Abstract Injecting CO2 into geological formations has become an important process for carbon sequestration to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels and mitigate climate change. Therefore, understanding the impact of CO2 injection on rock mechanical properties is essential for assessing the integrity and safety of storage sites. This study employs nanoindentation to measure variations in rock mechanical properties caused by CO2 injection. Nanoindentation provides localized measurements of hardness and elastic modulus. Results indicate significant alterations of more than 95% reduction in Young's modulus of the carbonate rock samples post-CO2 injection, with implications for the long-term stability of sequestration sites. This research contributes to the development of more accurate models for predicting the mechanical performance of CO2-injected carbonate rocks, ultimately enhancing the safety and efficacy of carbon sequestration and enhanced oil recovery using CO2 efforts.</description>

                Abstract The LNG industry stands at the cusp of a transformation driven by the climate imperative. Focusing on an innovative low emission industrial hub in Northern Australia, this paper shows how CO2 emissions can be reduced in a world-class LNG asset by strategic master planning, colocation of industrial facilities and taking a marginal cost approach to assessment, screening, and implementation of existing and new decarbonisation technologies. We propose: A new breed of electrified LNG processing facilities that could deliver a ~90% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 CO2 equivalent intensity with sufficient renewable firmed imported power &#8211; given that gas Driven emissions constitute ~78%-93% of Scope 1 and 2 CO2 equivalent emissions on a sample of current practice LNG facilities. Leveraging partnerships in upstream renewable power, hydrogen supply and enabled downstream carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, we outline how we can de-risk assets from economic and regulatory uncertainty by providing alternative pathways to sustaining emissions reduction. A strategic methodology to screen and implement &#8216;avoid and mitigate&#8217; options first, focusing on those opportunities the offer the most cost-effective emissions reduction opportunities. Phase 1 &#8211; Establish a Baseline Emissions Profile: At a conceptual level, estimate all emissions sources from energy usage to fugitive to flaring emissions in line with the relevant carbon accounting standards. Understand the largest emissions sources and their drivers.Phase 2: Identify &amp; Prioritise Emission Reduction Opportunities: Apply existing and innovative technologies to uncover opportunities for GHG emission reductions. Identify the GHG reduction potential and the lifecycle costs of implementation of such opportunities.Phase 3: Select Initiatives and Develop Emissions Reduction Roadmap: Plot all emissions reduction opportunities on a Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) that clearly shows the lowest to highest marginal abatement costs for each opportunity. Understand non-cost risks of each opportunity which may be technology readiness or third-party risks and then select the opportunities for more detailed assessment that align to your businesses strategic GHG reductions roadmap and risk appetite.

      <title>Reducing CO2 Emissions in Drilling Operation with 3D Mapping Technology</title>

                Abstract Kuwait reported has 89 million metric tons of CO2 emissions as per the 2020 world report published by United Nation (UN). The oil and gas sector significantly contributes to the country's economic growth while simultaneously serving as a major source of CO2 emissions. The country's national oil company has established an objective to reduce CO2 emissions in alignment with national goals. To achieve this, advancements in technology that can both minimize CO2 emissions and enhance productivity are essential. In Kuwait, the operator employed ultradeep azimuthal resistivity (UDAR) technology within a carbonate reservoir that has a production history spanning over 57 years. The primary objective of utilizing UDAR 3D reservoir mapping was to reduce unnecessary operations, such as the drilling of a pilot hole, which would otherwise consume additional energy. By eliminating these superfluous activities, the initiative aims to contribute to the minimization of carbon emissions through decreased energy consumption. The elimination of the pilot hole and the cement operation saved approximately 10 operational days per well. The rig energy saving from reduced fuel consumption amounted to approximately 230 metric tons CO2 / well. This reduction of the CO2 emissions through 3D reservoir mapping, established a new milestone and supported the nation&#8217;s goal of achieving full carbon neutrality by 2050.</description>

      <title>Molecular Evaluation of the Temperature Role on the Wettability of Carbonate/Brine/Gas Systems: Unlocking UAE's Underground Hydrogen Potential</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222258-ms</link>
      <description>Abdelateef M. Adam, Daniel Baham&#243;n, Mohammed Al Kobaisi, Lourdes F. Vega, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404014431

                Abstract Rock wetting characteristics directly affect the storage size, security, and fluid flow behavior in Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS). This study evaluates the impact of temperature variations on the wetting behavior of the UAE carbonate reservoirs in UHS environments and its implications for carbonates' structural and residual trapping capacities. A molecular-level discussion on the impact of temperature variation on UAE carbonates' wetting behavior during UHS implementation is presented for the first time. To obtain molecular insights into the storage process, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on carbonate/brine/H2+ cushion gas systems. A calcite substrate was used as a representative of the carbonate surface, and CO2 was selected as a cushion gas. Then, the wettability of calcite/brine/H2+CO2 was evaluated at a fixed pressure of 50 MPa, a temperature range of 323 to 388 K, and a fixed salt concentration of 15 wt. %, mirroring the typical reservoir conditions found in the UAE. We report that, at low temperature (323 K), the presence of CO2 in the gas stream (i.e., H2+CO2 mixture) leads to a reduction in the hydrophilicity of calcite due to the higher intermolecular van der Waals attraction found between the calcite and CO2 molecules, leading to CO2 aggregation at the calcite surface. With increasing temperature, the calcite-CO2 interactions diminish, and the calcite surface becomes perfectly water-wet. It can be concluded that due to the higher interactions between calcite-CO2 compared to calcite-H2 interactions, the utilization of CO2 as a cushion gas enhances the carbonate's ability to trap H2 gas by filling the smaller pores with brine and dissolved CO2 molecules while leaving the larger pores available for injected hydrogen. Additionally, introducing CO2 before injecting H2 reduces the amount of hydrogen that can be residually trapped, resulting in an enhanced H2 recovery process.</description>

      <title>A Numerical and Experimental Study to Compare Different IAQ-Based Smart Ventilation Techniques</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14113555</link>
      <description>Marcos Batistella Lopes, Najwa Kanama, Baptiste Poirier, Ga&#235;lle Guyot, Michel Ondarts, Evelyne Gonze, Nathan Mendes, Buildings. 14(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404122624

                Maintaining indoor environmental quality in residential buildings is essential for occupants&#8217; comfort, productivity, and health, with effective mechanical ventilation playing a key role in removing or diluting indoor pollutants. A two-week experimental campaign was conducted in an apartment in Lyon, France, known for its poor urban air quality, assessing temperature, relative humidity, CO2, and PM2.5 concentrations. A model verification study was performed to compare experimental measurements against numerical modeling in the living room and bedroom, leading to errors in the accuracy of the sensors. In addition, this study also investigates the impact of different ventilation strategies on indoor air quality. This research evaluates a baseline mechanical exhaust-only ventilation approach with constant air volume against two innovative smart ventilation approaches: mechanical exhaust-only ventilation with humidity control and mechanical exhaust-only ventilation with room-level CO2 and humidity control. A key contribution of this research is the novel coupling of multizone simulation models (DOMUS and CONTAM) with a CFD tool to refine pressure coefficients on the building fa&#231;ade, which enhances the accuracy of indoor air quality predictions. The smart ventilation strategies showed improvements, including a 20% reduction in CO2 concentration and a 5% reduction in the third-quartile PM2.5 concentration, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing ventilation and pollutant dilution. This research provides valuable insights into advanced ventilation strategies and modeling techniques in urban environments.</description>

      <title>Impacts of mode shift on well-to-wheel emissions from inter-capital transport in Australia &#8211; Part I: Road and rail transport</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.36922/eer.3470</link>
      <description>Robin Smit, P G Boulter, No host. 1(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404116379

                Achieving mode shift in the transport sector will help Australia to meet its target for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, although robust data on its effectiveness have previously been limited. This analysis provides valuable new information on mode shift impacts on emissions in Australia and demonstrates some recently developed assessment tools. The analysis considers the potential of a shift from road to rail to reduce well-to-wheel (WTW) emissions (as CO2-equivalents, CO2-e) in 2019, 2030, and 2050, specifically for a case study involving the transport of passengers and freight between Brisbane and Melbourne. The analysis provides emission intensities (EIs) in grams per passenger-km (g/pkm) and grams per tonne-km (g/tkm), as well as annualized emissions, and considers the variability and uncertainty in the estimates using a probabilistic approach. The transfer of passengers and freight from road to rail has the potential to significantly reduce emissions. Electric rail delivers the largest and least uncertain emission reductions. For passenger transport, the EI of electric rail (12 g CO2-e/pkm in 2030; 6.5 g CO2-e/pkm in 2050) is considerably lower than that of road transport (143.2 g CO2-e/pkm in 2030; 58.9 g CO2-e/pkm in 2050), and the uncertainty is lower. For freight transport, the EI of electric rail (8.6 g CO2-e/tkm in 2030; 5.0 CO2-e/tkm in 2050) is also substantially lower than that for road transport (48.3 g CO2-e/tkm in 2030; 29.5 g CO2-e/tkm in 2050). The EI for diesel rail freight (27.0 g CO2-e/tkm in 2030; 26.1 g CO2-e/tkm in 2050) is around half of the value for road transport in 2030, but road transport becomes more competitive by 2050. The complete transfer of passengers between Brisbane and Melbourne from road to electric rail would reduce annual WTW emissions for passenger transport by 75 &amp;ndash; 90%, depending on the year. The complete transfer of freight from road to diesel rail would reduce annual emissions by 45% in 2019 and 2030 and by 10% in 2050. The study and tools will help researchers, policymakers, transport/land-use planners, and network operators to quantify, design, and implement mode shift measures to reduce emissions.</description>

      <title>Development of a Risk-Based, Modelling Framework for Integrity Assessment of Legacy Wells in CO2 Storage Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222449-ms</link>
      <description>Saeed Ghanbari, Morteza Haghighat Sefat, David Davies, John Murray, Riccardo Bonfanti, Ian Martin, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404013745

                Abstract Demonstrating the integrity of Plugged and Abandoned (P&amp;A'd) legacy wells during CO2 storage projects is a crucial requirement for regulators, stakeholders, and operators. The corrosive nature of CO2 may affect the integrity of such wells, jeopardising the long-term containment of the CO2. This study illustrates the new capabilities, tailored for CO2 storage applications, of a modelling framework (Johnson et al, 2021a&amp;b) that provides a quantitative, risk-based assessment of the long-term integrity of legacy P&amp;A'd wells. The following three new modelling modules are added to this integrated framework to account for the key concerns due to the presence of CO2 in the system: The cement-CO2 geochemistry "add-on" module evaluates the phenomenon of cement's self-sealing/self-degradation behaviour. Carbonated water reacts with cement minerals; some of which are initially dissolved followed by a possible precipitation process that is controlled by the fluid's flow rate/residence time in the cement defects such so microannuli. The self-sealing mechanism can reduce the microannuli's width, potentially stopping CO2 leakage, while self-degradation has the opposite effect. The geomechanical "add-on" module quantifies changes in the size of defects within the well P&amp;A system when the pressure/stress changes during the CO2 storage process. Pressure/Stress variations change the radius of the casing and the size of the adjacent microannuli, altering the leakage rates within the legacy well system. The elastic/plastic stress behaviour of cement can potentially contribute to increasing risks. The CO2/casing corrosion "add-on" module estimates the rate of casing corrosion and subsequent reduction in casing thickness over time based on experimental data. Excessive corrosion can lead to casing breach. These processes increase the size of defective leakage paths and increase the leakage risk from the legacy well. On completion, the modelling framework will be capable of being an integral part of the risk-assessment process when (a) selecting between possible CCUS projects and (b) supporting operators, regulators and other stakeholders in their decision-making process when analysing CCUS proposals.</description>

                Abstract Reservoir modelling tools have played a significant role in designing the subsurface fluid injection, such as CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR). However, these models are computationally expensive; they require extensive geological and engineering data that often are not available in the early phase of carbon utilization and storage projects. This work presents the development of fast predictive models and optimization methodologies to quickly evaluate the CO2 EOR and storage operations in mature oil fields. Considerable experience with CO2 EOR and storage has been gained by the petroleum industry. In particular, the Weyburn-Midale project (Canada) is a comprehensive case to show how an oil reservoir could securely store CO2. Employing the Weyburn-Midale project, we developed, trained and tested several types of proxy models in multiple scenarios to assess the performance of the miscible CO2 flood in recovering residual oil, increasing the ultimate oil recovery factor while maximizing the permanent CO2 storage. The history matching of the Weyburn-Midale CO2 EOR model involved 216 well histories (producers and injectors) from 1964 to 2006 using a compositional reservoir simulator. The predominant exploitation scheme was based on an inverted nine-spot pattern waterflooding, water alternating CO2, and consequently CO2 injection. Two simulation data sets were employed at different periods of 1956 through 2006, and 2007 through 2025. Among several proxy models, an artificial neural network (ANN) model proved to accurately estimate features of interest, namely fluid production (oil, water, gas), fluid injection (water, CO2) and the amount of CO2 stored in the reservoir. Additionally, an autoregressive exogenous input (ARX) model was implemented to predict the future outputs in response to a future input. Inspection of the relative estimation error and the model fitness score showed that the proxy model was capable of rapidly reproducing the trend in the validation set satisfactorily. Lastly, we evaluated the transfer of learning from a proxy model, trained to the Weyburn-Midale field (Canada), to assess the performance of CO2 EOR in another mature oil reservoir in Europe (Romania). The application of proxy models under geological and operation uncertainties offers huge reduction in computational time and engineering data requirements. The results from the Weyburn-Midale case study deliver critical insights into the analysis of many process factors and modeling techniques intended to assess the economic limits and long-term performance of CO2 EOR and storage in mature oil fields.</description>

      <title>Emission control in a dual fuel low temperature combustion engine at intermediate loads</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/14680874241283508</link>
      <description>Nikhil Dilip Khedkar, Asish K Sarangi, Jos&#233; Mart&#237;n Herreros, International Journal of Engine Research. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404007546

                Intermediate to high load operation in dual fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) techniques is restricted due to uncontrolled combustion that causes engine knocking. Dual fuel strategies with advanced pilot injection and near-top dead center (TDC) main injection timings are reported to enhance combustion control, albeit with increased soot emissions, reduction of thermal efficiency, and emergence of an intricate trade-off between total hydrocarbon (THC) and oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) emissions. In order to address these conflicting issues, an intermediate engine load, corresponding to 6 bar gross indicated mean effective pressure at 1500 and 2200 rev/min engine speeds was investigated in this work. The main objectives of this work are (1) to obtain combination of control parameters to achieve near-zero engine-out NO x and soot emissions and high thermal efficiency while minimizing THC and CO emissions; (2) to understand the effectiveness of diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) for the oxidation and reduction of exhaust gas species in the dual fuel mode; and (3) to understand the oxidation characteristics of the soot generated from the dual fuel mode. Optimum dual fuel low temperature combustion strategies, in terms of diesel injection timings, quantity and exhaust gas recirculation levels, were identified using the statistical multi response signal to noise (MRSN) ratio method in which NO x , soot and indicated efficiency were response variables. The performance of commercial DOCs, with different precious metal (Pt and/or Pd) loadings, were also studied at optimum dual fuel strategies for gasoline-diesel dual fuel operations. High DOC outlet temperatures (&gt;&#8764;340&#176;C), due to the exotherm generated by the oxidation of high concentrations of THC and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from dual fuel operations, resulted in greater than 90% THC conversion efficiency. The exotherm decreased the nitric oxide (NO) oxidation whereas the nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) reduction reactions were favored over the DOC in the dual fuel mode at the intermediate load operating condition. Thermogravimetric analysis of the soot showed higher activation energy (177.2 kJ/mol), formed at the dual fuel optimum condition, relative to the activation energy (162.7 kJ/mol) of the soot formed in conventional diesel combustion (CDC).</description>

                The object of this study is a hybrid energy system that integrates the processes of recycling used tires with the use of alternative energy sources to design a sustainable and environmentally safe power generation system. The problem addressed in this study is to find effective methods for recycling waste tires for electricity generation, as traditional recycling methods are energy-intensive and lead to the loss of valuable resources. Three methods of tire processing have been considered: pyrolysis, thermal degradation, and mechanical grinding. The method of electricity generation using pyrolysis has demonstrated high environmental performance due to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a high rate of renewable energy (80 %). According to the results of the study, the use of 5 MW pyrolysis furnaces in combination with 500 kW solar panels provides a reduction in dependence on fossil sources, reducing CO2 emissions to 50.0 kg/year. The method has high capital costs (NPC USD 4.2 million), but the cost of energy production (COE USD 0.18/kWh) makes this method competitive in the long run. Thermal degradation provides a balanced approach in terms of energy efficiency (75 %) and environmental performance. Although its CO2 emissions are higher than in pyrolysis, the method makes it possible to obtain additional products that could be used in other industries, thereby increasing economic efficiency. Mechanical shredding has the lowest average energy costs (USD 0.12/kWh) and the lowest CO2 emissions (30.0 kg/year), making it ideal for cost-conscious businesses. The study confirms the possibility of effective integration of renewable sources with tire recycling methods. The practical use of the research results is possible during the implementation of grant projects for the recycling of used tires, and in the work of relevant government structures for devising a policy for the disposal of used tires</description>

      <title>Addressing the Complexities of Establishing a Comprehensive CO2 Storage Hub in the Large-Scale Saline Aquifer Offshore Malaysia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222302-ms</link>

                Abstract The rising CO2 emissions resulting from the development of high CO2 contaminated gas fields in Malaysia necessitate the identification of appropriate, secure, and capacious reservoirs for CO2 storage. Large-scale saline aquifers have emerged as promising solutions for establishing a storage hub equipped with extensive onshore injection facilities. Nevertheless, the development of a large-scale saline aquifer as a CO2 storage hub offshore Malaysia presents numerous intrinsic challenges. The current study focusses on identifying and evaluating the associated risks and uncertainties and formulating a mitigation strategy for the development of a large-scale storage hub within synrift sediments of a rift graben off the coast of peninsular Malaysia (PM). When establishing a large-scale CO2 storage hub, it's crucial to prioritize two key elements: containment integrity and storage capacity. However, these components carry inherent risks that demand careful management throughout the storage development process. Containment integrity entails risks related to reservoir and overburden formations, structural features, and well integrity within the storage reservoirs. Conversely, storage capacity can be influenced by factors like reservoir continuity, aquifer size and strength, caprock strength, and injectivity. The storage site was analyzed for its containment and capacity through extensive 3D data interpretation for generation of structural maps, mapping of major and minor faults, and attribute extraction, trap &amp; seal analysis, faults &amp; wells integrity analysis, 1D caprock integrity analysis, and effective storage capacity estimation through dynamic simulation. Dynamic simulation results of maximum storage capacity help deciding plausible mitigation plans, such as seismic data acquisition, appraisal well drilling, and coring, have been suggested to tackle these risks. However, quantifying the precise value added by these plans in terms of risk reduction presents a challenge. The workflow for this study to be used as the guideline for any future saline aquifer storage development plan feasibility study.</description>

      <title>Polymer-Enhanced Foam Formulation Design for CO2-Sequestration and Mobility Control in Carbonate Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222140-ms</link>
      <description>Mudassar Mumtaz, Muhammad Mushtaq, Emad W. Al-Shalabi, Waleed Alameri, Georgios N. Karanikolos, Stefan Iglauer, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404014460

                Abstract Polymer-enhanced CO2 foam (PEF) is an emerging technology for gas mobility control and CO2 storage in geologic formations to mitigate anthropogenic emissions. The foam generated by surfactants alone is prone to film rupture and low endurance, particularly in Middle Eastern carbonates under harsh conditions of high temperature and salinity. Adding polymer to a surfactant solution can enhance foam stability, increase viscosity, and resist liquid drainage. This study presents a systematic polymer-stabilized foam formulation design and optimization. The work particularly focuses on developing foam formulations while incorporating polymer in surfactant formulation to enhance the foaming performance. Anionic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, associative polymers, and an ATBS-based polymer were tested under high salinity brine (up to 167 kppm) and high temperature (up to 120&#176;C) conditions. The Design of Experiment (DOE) approach was used to formulate the composition of the PEF formulation toward achieving maximum bulk foam stability. The obtained optimized formulation was verified experimentally for its bulk foam properties and further tested in coreflooding experiments using a carbonate outcrop to assess mobility reduction factor (MRF) and CO2 storage potential. The results showed that selected surfactants, polymers, and combinations were stable at a high temperature of 120&#176;C and a high salinity of 167 kppm; further tests were conducted at 95&#176;C and 105 kppm salinity. The bulk foam stability results indicated that using a combination of surfactants and polymers significantly improved foam stability expressed by the foam&#8217;s half-life. To understand the impact of each component, the data was analyzed using various mixture regression models, and the cubic model fitted well with the foam half-life response. Binary-surfactant foam formulations performed better than using a single surfactant system. However, the ternary foam formulation of surfactants with polymer showed a strong interaction and a significant synergistic effect. The optimized polymer-enhanced foam formulation consists of 6201 ppm C-5, 3500 ppm SB, and 183.2 ppm SAV-10 polymer as high as 132 minutes at 95&#176;C and atmospheric pressure. Additionally, the study revealed that polymer addition played a crucial role in enhancing foam longevity. Increasing the polymer concentration to adequate levels helps reduce foam coalescence due to high viscous resistance and strong foam films. Polymer concentration lower than the optimized levels renders foam less stable and weak. On the other hand, a higher concentration than the optimum results in faster foam collapse due to the fast liquid drainage. The coreflooding results showed that the optimized PEF formulation performed exceptionally well in reducing CO2 mobility and enhancing CO2 storage capacity under high-salinity (105 kppm), high-temperature (95&#176;C), and high-pressure (1500 psi) conditions. The optimized PEF formulation generated strong foam in porous media; the mobility reduction factor (MRF) was recorded 50.2, showing higher foam viscosity than gas and brine during the injection. Furthermore, foam flooding with the optimized PEF resulted in a higher CO2 storage capacity of 77.1% compared to 14.8% for gas injection. Previous studies utilized random formulation methods to improve foaming performance by incorporating polymer as a foam stabilizer, neglecting to optimize foam stability requirements. This study is one of the few systematic works to design, optimize, and test the best-performing PEF formulation that can withstand harsh Middle Eastern reservoir conditions, providing in-depth mobility control and ensuring long-term CO2 sequestration.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Nigeria's Power Sector with and without
  Grid-Scale Storage: Future Implications for Emission and Renewable Energy
  Integration</title>

      <description>Stanley Aimhanesi Eshiemogie, Peace Aielumoh, Tobechukwu Okamkpa, M. Joseph Auxilius Jude, Lois Efe, Andrew Nosakhare Amenaghawon, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404088436

                This research proposes a framework for modeling and comparing two electricity scenarios for Nigeria by 2050, focusing on the inclusion and exclusion of electricity storage technologies. A Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to generate a design matrix for data collection, with EnergyPLAN software used to create energy system simulations on the CCD data for four outputs: total annual cost, CO2 emissions, critical excess electricity production (CEEP), and electricity import. Three machine learning algorithms, support vector regression (SVR), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), were tuned using Bayesian optimization to develop models mapping the inputs to outputs. A genetic algorithm was employed for multi-objective optimization to determine the optimal input capacities that minimize the outputs. Results indicated that incorporating electricity storage technologies (EST) leads to a 37% increase in renewable electricity sources (RES) share, resulting in a 19.14% reduction in CO2 emissions. EST such as battery energy storage systems (BESS), pumped hydro storage (PHS), and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) storage allow for the storage of the critical excess electricity that comes with increasing RES share. Integrating EST in Nigeria's 2050 energy landscape is crucial for incorporating more renewable electricity sources into the energy system, thereby reducing CO2 emissions and managing excess electricity production. This study outlines a plan for optimal electricity production to meet Nigeria's 2050 demand, highlighting the need for a balanced approach that combines fossil fuels, renewable energy, nuclear power, and advanced storage solutions to achieve a sustainable and efficient electricity system.</description>

      <title>Oil&amp;amp;Gas Decarbonization: Low-Carbon Fuels and Carbon Capture &amp;amp; Storage Offshore Power Barges, a Comprehensive Concepts Comparison</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222007-ms</link>
      <description>J&#233;r&#244;me Anfray, Alexandre Pactat, E. Gaouyat, T. Boscals-de-Reals, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404013477

                Abstract The objective of this paper is to present and compare two concepts to decarbonize Oil&amp;Gas production facilities, particularly remote deep-offshore assets. The two offshore power barges concepts, called PGU (Power Generation Unit) are either based on low-carbon fuels or on local Capture &amp; Storage to supply low carbon power &amp; enable offshore facilities electrification. One of the main challenges of the Net Zero ambition for the Oil&amp;Gas industry (scope 1 and scope 2) is the reduction of GHG emissions related to the fuel gas consumption for power generation (&amp;gt;70% of the CO2 emissions), particularly for offshore remote sites where Power from Shore is not feasible. Centralized floating Power Generation Units (PGU) can be connected to existing platforms and/or FPSOs to supply low carbon electricity. Either with an offshore PGU fed with low carbon fuels (green or blue ammonia). The PGU include all the functions to store, treat &amp; convert ammonia into a blend of hydrogen and ammonia. Either with an offshore PGU with carbon capture and injection into a local CO2 storage (CCS). The PGU includes a compact backpressure combined cycle, a post combustion solvent based (MEA), a capture package designed for 95% CO2 removal. Some units are directly integrated in the structure of the hull to optimize weight &amp; space. 325 MWe of net electrical power are generated. This low carbon power is exported from the PGU to existing offshore facilities equipped with single cycle gas turbines (&amp;lt;40% efficiency, 500 gCO2/kWh). This decarbonized power is exported through subsea electrical cables. The two concepts are compared in term of technical feasibility, maturity, GHG reduction and costs. A Life cycle analysis was performed to evaluate the environmental impact. These low carbon power generation solutions (30 gCO2/kWh) enable to stop gas turbines on site. The two concepts result in similar floaters dimensions and Capex, with a higher Opex for the carbon free fuel due to fuel cost. The offshore CCS concept is seen as a shorter-term solution, applicable in the current decade, main challenge being the availability of an adequate CO2 storage to ensure a sustainable local reinjection. R&amp;D focus on technology innovations to reduce costs. As an alternative, the offshore NH3 PGU concept is a longer-term solution for hard to abate sites, where CO2 reservoir availability can be an issue. A Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) shows that ammonia chain shall be green or fully sequestrated. R&amp;D is driven by the need for new technologies, fully fuel flexible Gas Turbines to address multiple low carbon fuels scenarios. These developments shall be started now to enable this concept when the low carbon fuel market will be ready. The novelty relies on the development and comparison of offshore power barges concepts delivering a minimum of 325MWe, either based on low-carbon fuels (ammonia) or CCS to power &amp; decarbonize existing assets.</description>

                Global CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have reached unprecedented levels, driven primarily by anthropogenic emissions. This alarming rise in greenhouse gases (GHGs) presents a significant challenge to global climate stability, with CO2 being the primary contributor to climate change. Industrial activities are major sources of these emissions, highlighting the urgent need for innovative and sustainable solutions. Plasma technology emerges as particularly promising, which creates a highly reactive environment through the presence of high-energy electrons. By leveraging such processes, CO2 can be transformed into useful chemicals, contributing to both emissions reduction and resource circularity. One interesting reaction, which can be carried out in a plasma environment, is the dry reforming of methane (DRM), a process that utilizes CO2 and methane (CH4) to produce a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2). These are valuable intermediates for further chemical synthesis, which can be used to synthesize a variety of chemicals and fuels. Through chemical kinetics modelling a wide range of conditions is explored to better understand the core chemical kinetics of DRM in warm plasmas. Thereby examining the performance of the process across a wide temperature range and highlighting the limitations of various gas mixtures. The findings demonstrate where plasma-specific kinetics diverges from thermal gas-phase chemistry, offering new insights into the unique behaviour of plasma-driven reactions. Also, the effect of nitrogen (N2) on plasma-based DRM is investigated through computational modelling to support experimental results and demonstrate the role of N2 in the conversion process within a gliding arc plasmatron (GAP) reactor. Revealing a small fraction of N2 can improve the process. Furthermore, after the plasma has converted the gas molecules, further chemical changes can still occur, influencing the overall efficiency and product distribution. The model demonstrates that quenching the gas temperature does not generally improve performance, except in CO2-rich mixtures where certain reactions are influenced by the cooling process, leading to notable changes in the product distribution. The benefits of combining the hot plasma effluent with unconverted gas are also explored, as the residual heat from the plasma can be reused to drive additional reactions, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the process. The findings presented improve the understanding of plasma-based DRM technology, forming a foundation for further experimental and theoretical studies, and contribute to the broader goal of reducing GHG emissions and supporting the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future.</description>

                Illuminated giant cells of Characeae comprise alternating areas with H+ pump activity and zones with high conductivity for H+/OH&#8211;, which create counter-directed H+ flows between the medium and the cytoplasm. In areas where H+ enters the cell, the pH on the surface (pHo) increases to pH 10, while the cytoplasmic pH (pHc) decreases. The lack of the permeant substrate of photosynthesis (CO2) and the acidic pHc shift in the region of external alkaline zones redirect electron transport in chloroplasts from CO2-dependent (assimilatory) pathway to O2 reduction. This electron transport route is associated with an increase in thylakoid membrane &#916;pH and an enhanced nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) of chlorophyll excitations, which underlies strict coordination between nonuniform distributions of pHo and photosynthetic activity in resting cells. When the action potential (AP) is generated, the longitudinal pH profile is temporarily smoothed out, while the heterogeneity of the distribution of NPQ and PSII photochemical activity (YII) sharply increases. The damping of the pHo profile is due to the suppression of the H+ pump and passive H+ conductance under the influence of an almost 100-fold increase in the cytoplasmic of Ca2+ level ([Ca2+]c) during AP. The increase in [Ca2+]c stimulates photoreduction of O2 in chloroplasts under external alkaline zones and, at the same time, arrests the cytoplasmic streaming, which causes the accumulation of excess amounts of H2O2 in the cytoplasm in areas of intense production of this metabolite, with a weak effect on areas of CO2 assimilation. These changes enhance the nonuniform distribution of cell photosynthesis and account for the long-term oscillations of chlorophyll fluorescence Fm' and the quantum efficiency of linear electron flow in microscopic cell areas after the AP generation.</description>

      <title>Rising atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations: the overlooked factor promoting SW Iberian Forest development across the LGM and the last deglaciation?</title>

      <description>Sandra Domingues Gomes, William Fletcher, Abi Stone, Teresa Rodrigues, Andreia Rebotim, Dulce Oliveira, Mar&#305;&#769;a Fernanda S&#225;nchez Go&#241;i, Fatima F Abrantes, Filipa Naughton, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404119723

                Abstract. Across the last deglaciation, the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (pCO2) increased from ~180 to ~280 ppm. However, the impact of pCO2 changes on vegetation across the last deglaciation remains poorly understood. Under full glacial low pCO2, plants experienced constraints on photosynthesis. Therefore, a significant reduction in pCO2 limitation should have impacted local and regional vegetation dynamics across deglaciation. We hypothesise that deglacial pCO2 rise could have (1) led to a gradual reduction of the physiological constraint promoting forest response when moisture availability was sufficient, despite low temperatures; and (2) amplified the response of forest development to warmer and wetter conditions. The high-resolution analysis of terrestrial (pollen, C29:C31 organic biomarker) and marine (alkenone-derived Sea Surface Temperature, C37: 4%, and long-chain n-alkanes ratios) indicators, using a direct land-sea direct comparison, in the Iberian margin site Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) U1385 ("Shackleton site") throughout the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and last deglaciation allowed us to track and compare the changes with shifts in global pCO2. The LGM is characterised by a grassland-heathland mosaic type ecosystem, triggered by cool and moderately humid conditions but low pCO2 levels may have exacerbated physiological drought and suppressed forest development. During Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1)the coldest and most arid conditions combined with sustained low pCO2 values precluded forest development and resulted in the dominance of Mediterranean steppe or semi-desert vegetation. The B&#248;lling-Aller&#248;d (BA) is characterised by a temperature optimum (warmest SSTs and forest development) and variable moisture condition, while increasing pCO2 which contributed to the highest levels of forest development. Within the BA, significant SW Iberian forest development occurred at ~15 cal kyr B.P. associated with an increase in pCO2 above 225 ppm. During the Younger Dryas (YD), cool temperatures combined with sufficient moisture availability allowed the maintenance of a grassland-forest mosaic, the increasing values of pCO2 in this period should have offset the low temperature as well as the moisture levels and allow the forest to persist. The overlooked role of pCO2 could explain an intriguing feature observed in Site U1385 and other Iberian margin records, namely the near absence of forest during the LGM and HS1 but relatively high forest cover during the YD. Our study aims to shed light on the influence of climatic factors (temperature and moisture availability) together with pCO2 as thresholds on forest response to deglacial climate changes across the Iberian Peninsula.</description>

                The increasing environmental challenges posed by the widespread use of fossil fuels and the fluctuating nature of renewable energy have driven the need for more efficient and sustainable energy solutions. Current research is actively exploring hybrid energy systems as a means to address these issues. One such area of focus is the integration of Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs) with gas and steam turbines, utilizing both natural gas (NG) and solar parabolic trough collectors (PTCs) as energy sources. This study examines the performance of a hybrid system implemented in Kirkuk, Iraq, a region known for its substantial solar radiation. Previous research has shown that hybrid systems can effectively enhance energy conversion efficiency and reduce environmental impacts, but there is still a need to assess the specific benefits of such systems in different geographical and operational contexts. The analysis reveals a thermal efficiency of 59.32% and an exergy efficiency of 57.28%. The exergoeconomic analysis highlights the optimal energy cost at USD 71.93/MWh when the compressor pressure ratio is set to 8 bar. The environmental assessment demonstrates a significant reduction in CO2/emissions, with a carbon footprint of 316.3 kg CO2/MWh at higher compressor pressure ratios. These results suggest that integrating solar energy with natural gas can substantially improve electricity generation while being both cost-effective and environmentally sustainable.</description>

      <title>Integrating Neural Operators and Transfer Learning for Efficient Carbon Storage Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222406-ms</link>
      <description>Yusuf Falola, Siddharth Misra, Andres Nunez, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404014211

                Abstract Efficient forecasting involves generating accurate and reliable predictions while minimizing the use of resources, such as time, training data, and computational power. This study investigates the potential of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) combined with transfer learning (FNO+TL) for forecasting the spatiotemporal evolution of pressure and CO2 saturation in a large, heterogeneous geological carbon-storage aquifer. The enhanced FNO models, trained on the SACROC geological model, achieved high accuracy, with mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.046 MPa for pressure and 0.011 for saturation in large aquifer models. Transfer learning (TL) further enabled the adaptation of a trained FNO model to diverse operational conditions with minimal new training data. The adapted models achieved pressure prediction MAEs of 0.27 MPa, 0.51 MPa, and 0.59 MPa, and saturation prediction MAEs of 0.05, 0.056, and 0.14, under varying injection rates, schedules, and injector locations, respectively. Additionally, the FNO models generalized successfully to a geologically distinct site at the Illinois Basin - Decatur Project (IBDP), which had significantly different carbon storage operations. The models achieved prediction MAEs of 4.5 psia for pressure and 0.11 for saturation, with reductions of 87% and 80% in training data requirements, respectively. Furthermore, the FNO+TL models significantly reduced computational costs. The study concludes that integrating transfer learning with Fourier Neural Operators provides an efficient and scalable approach for CO2 storage forecasting.</description>

      <title>Coupled Fluid Flow-Geomechanics Modelling for CO2 Storage Simulation with Thermal Effects in a Depleted Gas Reservoir</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222239-ms</link>
      <description>Julian Guerra, Christna Golaco, S. Rahman, M. Povstyanova, M. J. Robert, V. Stashevsky, Coriolan Rat, Hathama Razooki Hasan, M. Shady, Siddharth Jain, S. Stojic, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404014480

                Abstract This case study describes the workflow implemented to model and assess the CO2 site storage integrity, using coupled thermal dynamic-geomechanics modeling of supercritical CO2 in the study field and its impact on the reservoir, caprock, fault deformation, and eventual failure. The One-way coupled fluid-flow geomechanics simulation examines the impact of reservoir re-pressurization and thermal cooling in the caprock deformation, reservoir integrity and fault stability, associated to physical phenomena such as Joule-Thomson expansion, heat diffusion, and undrained deformation processes. The reservoir model was augmented by adding the overburden, sideburden and underburden to not only impose the boundary conditions but also for capturing the impact of the thermal changes in the caprock. The simulation is conducted by bringing the pressure and temperature changes into the geomechanics simulation to compute rock deformation and eventual failure. Rock yielding was assessed in all the materials to determine critical zones and pressure thresholds that should be avoided during CO2 injection. The dynamic simulation and well modeling showed a large temperature reduction at the bottomhole due to CO2 expansion effects (Joule-Thomson). These effects were reduced as the reservoir repressurized. A correlation of bottomhole pressure and temperature with reservoir pressure was developed to capture the impact of changing temperature over time with reservoir re-pressurization. The coupling of these dynamic changes over time with geomechanics demonstrated that caprock integrity was not compromised, but certain locations posed more risk than others. The fault integrity showed locations with potential for reactivation, depending on the fault type and maximum injection pressures. These limits should be considered during the injection plan. In general, thermal effects play the most critical role in the risk of rock failure and fault reactivation, and this risk is enhanced by reservoir re-pressurization (playing a secondary role), especially in proximity to the injection wells. Both shear and tensile failures are mainly influenced by severe cooling around the injectors. This cooling generally extends 3-4 cells around the wellbore (150-200m), sometimes even extending &amp;gt;400m. The simulation shows the Nahr Umr Formation caprock is competent enough, only slightly affected by thermal effects when exposed to the main injection borehole with a very low risk of hydrofracturing. In general, injection pressures for all the injection scenarios fall below the fracturing pressure across the reservoir; nonetheless, the fracturing pressure might be reduced drastically due to the severe cooling around some injector wells, which tends to reduce the stresses and create tensile failure. The study demonstrated that the potential integrity problems can be mitigated by using an adequate injection strategy, selecting injection and monitoring wells, staging the injection rates, and limiting the cooling effects around the injectors. A coupled fluid-flow geomechanics simulation must be standard practice to study the complex physical phenomena involved in CO2 injection properly, especially in heavily depleted reservoirs containing compositional fluids and scenarios containing injection mixes (CO2 and H2S) The coupled injection allowed the simulation of complex phenomena, including the Joule-Thomson effect in the reservoir, the heat transfer in the caprock (diffusion), and the undrained deformation process in the caprock.</description>

      <title>Ultra Mobile Solar Hybrid Solution for Mobile Rig Camps in Abu Dhabi</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222490-ms</link>
      <description>Ameen Grizi, Feras Shadid, Hassan Shamma, Imad Al Hamlawi, Luis Ant&#244;nio De Souza Baptista, Tariq Mohammed, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404013846

                Abstract This paper presents the implementation and performance evaluation of a mobile solar-hybrid power system deployed by an onshore oil &amp; gas operator in the UAE. The system uses an ultra-mobile, containerized solar solution to power mobile accommodation camps, traditionally powered by conventional diesel generators. Since November 2023, the operator has been using this system to power a mobile rig camp in a prolific field southwest of Abu Dhabi. The system comprises two 75 kWp solar containers (including inverters), a control panel (energy management system and data logger), and two diesel generators (one prime and one standby), with capacities varying according to load requirements over the operation duration. The energy management system, developed in-house by the provider, maximizes solar utilization, and ensures efficient operation of all energy sources. The system has provided substantial benefits over its nine-month operation, primarily reducing CO2 emissions by 47% compared to diesel-only generators. This equates to approximately 262 tons of CO2 or around 100,000 liters of diesel saved. The containerized design enables rapid transport and installation, with mobilization times of under four hours. The hybrid system also lowers fuel consumption and maintenance costs, improving the economic viability of running the mobile rig camp. Real-time monitoring is crucial to the system's safe and efficient operation, providing high reliability and uptime without requiring excessive onsite personnel. Compared to the previous diesel generator setup, the hybrid system's reliability is a significant advantage, eliminating frequent shutdowns caused by manual generator switchovers. Overall, the deployment of the ultra-mobile containerized solar-diesel hybrid power system has been successful, demonstrating significant CO2 emissions reduction and improved operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The lessons learned from this project highlight the importance of sustainable energy solutions for off-grid applications in the oil and gas sector.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222178-ms</link>
      <description>Muhammad Aslam, F. Haider, Eisa Al Balooshi, Abdulla Al Ketbi, Khulood Alshehhi, Mohammed Amir, Sajjad Ahmed, MS. Ahmed, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404014507

                Abstract Significant energy is consumed for the transportation and pumping of crude oil from processing facilities to terminals through long distance piping networks. This paper emphasizes on the technologies advancements and strategic initiative of drag reducing agents deployment at ADNOC Onshore asset that reduced the frictional losses of the network and thus saved more than 1.4 MM USD in terms of power tariff, enhanced facility availability and abatement of more than 16000 M ton CO2 / Year. Major energy consumer in Oil and Gas facilities is export pumping system, where stabilized crude oil is pumped to shipping terminals. High energy consumption in the export pipeline system is caused by significant pressure losses due to turbulent flows caused by the trajectory and long length of network. Suitable selection is very essential, to ensure the energy efficiency and compatibility of the chemical. Therefore, very stringent evaluation criteria DRAs adopted includes. Compatibility with the piping material to avoid any potential chemical reaction, thus integrity of network.Effectiveness in reducing the drag and improvement in pressure drop.Stability of the DRA under the extreme operating conditions.Operability concerns.Cost-effectiveness and rate of return. Environmental and safety considerations, such as the toxicity and biodegradability of the DRA. For the better understanding of drag reduction mechanism in crude oil pipelines and optimum dosage selection of chemical, various published literature and several technology providers were consulted. Based on the evaluation criteria, pilot was conceived at the major asset in Adnoc Onshore for one year. Pilot deployment of Drag reducing agent has shown significant energy saving. DRA dosage of 2 mg/L in the export crude oil network has reduced back pressure up to 5 bar from the network and thus enabled Asset to stop one export pump while maintaining the sustainable oil production rate. This strategic initiative for energy efficiency enhancement and decarbonization has resulted in OPEX reduction of more than 1.4 MM USD / year in terms of power tariff and GHG abatement of 16000 m Tons CO2 / Year, along with 30% enhancing the availability of facilities. This paper presents the recent innovations of DRAs deployment for crude oil export system and also summaries the viability of chemicals utilization for friction reduction and provides stringent selection criteria that ensures optimum dosage to ensure net positive return on investment. This paper also sheds light on the operational constraints encountered during the deployment and design consideration during the design of new facilities.</description>

      <title>Impact of Urban Form in the Yangtze River Delta of China on the Spatiotemporal Evolution of Carbon Emissions from Transportation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16229678</link>

                The impact of urban form on carbon emissions has become a crucial issue for sustainable socioeconomic development and the advancement of low-carbon cities. Transportation is a significant source of urban carbon emissions, highlighting the need for comprehensive research to aid China in achieving its carbon peak and neutrality goals. Currently, there is a lack of quantitative studies exploring the effects of urban form on transportation-related carbon emissions. This paper seeks to quantify the effect of urban form on the spatial and temporal patterns of transportation carbon emissions, utilizing panel data from 27 cities in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of China, covering the years 2000 to 2020. First, CO2 emissions from transportation are estimated following IPCC guidelines, with Moran&#8217;s I utilized to analyze spatial autocorrelation. Next, urban form indicators are quantified based on landscape ecology theory. Finally, econometric models are employed for regression analysis of the panel data. The findings reveal that urban complexity, compactness, and expansion influence transportation carbon emissions to varying degrees, with urban expansion and complexity associated with increased emissions, while compactness contributes to their reduction. This study offers theoretical support and a scientific basis for low-carbon urban spatial planning and development, underscoring the importance of urban form in emissions reduction strategies.</description>

      <title>Responses of N2O, CO2, and NH3 Emissions to Biochar and Nitrification Inhibitors Under a Delayed Nitrogen Application Regime</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14111986</link>
      <description>Haizhong Wu, Daichang Wang, Dengxiao Zhang, Wei Rao, Qing&#8208;Song Yuan, Xiaobo Shen, Guanjun-J Ma, Jie Xiao-lei, Shi&#8208;Liang Liu, Agriculture. 14(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404059372

                Greenhouse gas and NH3 emissions are exacerbated by the inappropriate timing and excessive application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers in wheat cultivation in China. In this study, the impacts on N2O, CO2, and NH3 emissions of a delayed and reduced N application regime on the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain were investigated. The treatments comprised the control (N0), conventional N at 270 kg N ha&#8722;1 (N270) and optimized N application of 180 kg N ha&#8722;1 (N180), N180 + biochar at 7.5 t ha&#8722;1 (N180B7.5), N180 + biochar at 15 t ha&#8722;1 (N180B15), N180 + DMPP (a nitrification inhibitor; N180D), N180D + biochar at 7.5 t ha&#8722;1 (N180DB7.5), and N180D + biochar at 15 t ha&#8722;1 (N180DB15). Reduced N application (N180) lowered N2O and NH3 emissions. Biochar application resulted in a 4&#8211;25% and 12&#8211;16% increase in N2O and NH3 emissions, respectively. Application of DMPP significantly decreased N2O emissions by 32% while concurrently inducing a 9% increase in NH3 emissions. Co-application of DMPP and biochar significantly reduced the activity of nitrification enzymes (HAD, NOO), resulting in a reduction of 37&#8211;38% in N2O emissions and 13&#8211;14% in NH3 emissions. No significant differences in CO2 emissions were observed among the various N treatments except the N0 treatment. Application of DMPP alone did not significantly affect grain yield. However, biochar, in combination with DMPP, effectively increases grain yield. The findings suggest that the N180DB15 treatment has the potential to reduce emissions of N2O and NH3 while concurrently enhancing soil fertility (pH, SOC) and wheat yield.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of the Combustion Process and Emissions Formation in a Heavy-Duty Diesel Engine Featured with Multi-Pulse Fuel Injection</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.4271/2024-01-4285</link>
      <description>Harsimran Singh, Almoutazbellah Kutkut, Pinaki Pal, Suresh K. Aggarwal, Hailin Li, SAE technical papers on CD-ROM/SAE technical paper series. 1(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404028840

                &lt;div class="section abstract"&gt;&lt;div class="htmlview paragraph"&gt;Combustion in conventional and advanced diesel engines is an intricate process that encompasses interaction among fuel injection, fuel-air mixing, combustion, heat transfer, and engine geometry. Manipulation of fuel injection strategies has been recognized as a promising approach for optimizing diesel engine combustion. Although numerous studies have investigated this topic, the underlying physics behind flame interactions from multiple fuel injections, spray-flame-wall interaction and their effects on reaction zones, and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/soot emissions are still not well understood. To this end, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study is performed to investigate the effects of pilot and post injections on in-cylinder combustion process and emissions (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and soot) formation in a heavy-duty (HD) diesel engine. A full-sector CFD model of the HD engine employing detailed chemistry is validated against experimental data for in-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, combustion phasing, and engine-out NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/soot and carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions at five load points. The validated CFD model is further leveraged to gain insights into the complex pilot-main and main-post injection interactions at low load (20%) and mid load (60%) conditions, respectively. The 20% load point consists of four fuel injections (two pilots, one main and one post injection), whereas 60% load point has three injections (one pilot, one main and one post). It is observed that pilot injections significantly alter the main flame structure by shifting reaction zones contributing to heat release from combined rich premixed + non-premixed + lean premixed zones to primarily non-premixed zones. Presence of pilot injection decreases NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; concentration (while shifting the contribution of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; towards NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; from 50% to 14%) and increases soot concentration. The local consumption of oxygen and less time available for main fuel-air mixing due to reduction in ignition delay (ID) caused by the pilot injection are the major reasons behind increase in soot. The investigation on post injection reveals that although post injection increases soot formation, it also increases soot oxidation, with soot oxidation dominating soot formation. This results in an overall reduction in soot emissions. Hydroxyl (OH) radicals play an important role in enhancing the soot oxidation rate. Furthermore, as the post start-of-injection (SOI) timing is retarded, both soot formation and oxidation decrease, with an overall increase in net soot emissions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                Purpose. The purpose of this work is to assess the pollution of atmospheric air in Dnipro city as a result of dust entrainment from the ash-disposal areas of Prydniprovsk TPP. The methods. Assessment of atmospheric air pollution in the city of Dnipro as a result of dust entrainment from the ash-disposal areas of Prydniprovska TPP was carried out as follows: physical and chemical characteristics of the stored fly ash were determined; specific dust entrainment from the surface of dry beaches of ash-disposal areas under the most favorable conditions was determined; mathematical modeling of the spread of atmospheric air pollution of Dnipro city by suspended particles was carried out using UPCAP "ECO Center"program; a comparative assessment of dust entrainment reduction due to the gradual processing of the deposited fly ash was carried out. Findings. Almost 100% of the total mass of ash consists of particles smaller than 80 &#956;m, the content of particles smaller than 10 and 2.5 &#956;m is 27.7 and 8.2%, respectively. The main chemical compounds contained in ash are silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, iron (III) oxide and carbon. The gross entrainment of substances in the form of suspended fine-grained solid particles from the surface of the dry beaches of the Prydniprovska TPP ash-disposal facilities is 18,654 tons per year. The area of atmospheric air pollution of Dnipro city by suspended particles is about 850 km2 and covers Samarskyi, Sobornyi, partly Industrialnyi and Shevchenkivskyi Districts. As a result of the implementation of a waste-free technology for the processing of fly ash with the utilization of the iron-containing fraction, the area of pollution can be reduced by 13.5 times up to 63 km2, the contamination zone in this case will cover underpopulated part of Samarskyi District of the city of Dnipro. Scientific novelty. A refined dependence of the particle size distribution of the mature Prydniprovsk TPP fly ash particles was determined for the further assessment of potential dust entrainment. For the first time, modeling of the distribution of fine-grained particles of fly ash of the Prydniprovsk TPP in the atmospheric air of the city of Dnipro was carried out, taking into account meteorological conditions, conditions of dust formation and particle size distribution. Practical implementation. The results of the research can contribute to reducing the level of atmospheric air pollution in the city of Dnipro. This will improve the quality of life of the local population and protect the natural environment from negative impacts. Research results can also be a basis for the development and implementation of technological solutions for the waste-free processing of stored fly ash with marketable products obtaining.</description>

                Abstract Decarbonising industrial clusters is critical to achieving the UK&#8217;s net-zero industrial strategy. This study focuses on Teesside, an industrial cluster in Northeast England, analysing its transition through the framework of the Sociology of Expectations (SoE). The research investigates the role of public and private stakeholders in driving decarbonisation efforts, concentrating on a limited set of technologies and large-scale megaprojects, especially carbon capture, hydrogen production, CO2 and hydrogen transport. The study highlights the challenges of deploying these first-of-a-kind technologies, which are not yet commercially viable in the UK. Our analysis identifies both opportunities and significant risks in Teesside&#8217;s approach, particularly the potential over-reliance on a narrow range of technologies. The findings raise concerns about the assumed reductions in costs and carbon emissions, questioning the feasibility of scaling these technologies for long-term industrial sustainability. The main implication is that, should the technologies currently favoured by incumbent industry fail to perform, the expectations could play a double and contradictory role in net-zero transitions&#8212;by both motivating actors to legitimise decarbonisation technologies, yet blinding others to the significant challenges that lie ahead.</description>

      <title>Structured Energy Trending and Performance Assessment for Combustion Engine (SETPACE&#169;) - An Innovative Approach to Decarbonize Combustion Emissions from Upstream Operations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222373-ms</link>
      <description>Zaid H. Ali, A. Azuhan, Yongseok Lee, Md. Abdul Hakim, Mohd Nasir Taib, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404014314

                Abstract This paper introduces a state-of-the-art tool known as SETPACE&#169; (Structured Energy Trending and Performance Assessment for Combustion Engine) which has the capability to validate authenticity of fuel gas flow meter reading, improving fuel gas accounting; quantify fuel efficiency (thermal efficiency) degradation by comparing theoretical vs actual fuel consumption for individual machines based on current operating parameters; quantify fuel gas reduction from various improvement opportunities and generate near-to-real fuel gas forecast. PETRONAS Upstream Energy Efficiency (EE) journey, which began in 2021, aims to reduce energy consumption without affecting production, thereby increasing gas sales and decreasing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. By 2023, SETPACE&#169; had been widely implemented across all domestic assets in Malaysia. More than 90% of fuel gas (energy) within these assets is consumed for gas compression and power generation. The assessment of over 170 turbomachines across more than 80 oil and gas facilities has revealed that approximately 18% fuel gas reduction from year 2023 conventional forecast is discovered through accounting and forecasting improvement. Baseline results show gas turbines&#8217; fuel efficiency estimate ranging from 4% to 32%. Fuel inefficiency in machinery typically stems from two (2) main factors: performance degradation and low operating loads. Machines with significant deviations in fuel efficiency often consume more fuel than necessary due to deteriorated performance. Addressing this through performance restoration, typically as part of routine planned maintenance, can reduce fuel gas consumption. This approach is particularly viable if the cost is offset by fuel gas savings, with an estimated maximum reduction of 11% from the actual fuel gas reported in 2023. Gas Turbine Generators (GTGs), designed for redundancy and to manage upstream uncertainties, may operate at low loads, leading to inefficient fuel use. While this operational philosophy ensures reliability, it results in higher fuel consumption. Optimizing GTG train operations is estimated to achieve an additional 5% reduction in fuel gas consumption. Furthermore, energy demand optimization and partial electrification is estimated to contribute an additional 11% reduction in fuel gas usage. Decarbonizing combustion through Energy Efficiency (EE) measures is anticipated to reduce GHG emissions by approximately 0.8 to 1.4 million tons of CO2 equivalent per year and recover energy, resulting in an estimated annual savings of USD 20 to 35 million.</description>

                The study evaluates the energy and environmental performance of Ecuador's upstream oil facilities between 2015 and 2020, focusing on major extraction blocks. By analyzing data on oil, gas, and water production, fossil fuel consumption, and electricity usage, key performance indicators were developed to assess efficiency and environmental impact. The findings revealed disparities in energy efficiency, with Block 43-ITT being the most efficient at 7.82 kWh per barrel, while Block 57-LB was the least efficient at 31.41 kWh per barrel. The study emphasizes that maturing oil fields require more energy and emit more greenhouse gases, underlining the necessity for sustainable energy practices. EP Petroecuador&#8217;s initiatives, such as substituting fuel and integrating renewable electricity, led to a reduction of approximately 540 kTons of CO2 emissions by replacing 163.32 million gallons of diesel with low-carbon fuels and renewable electricity. These findings serve as a baseline for optimizing energy use and reducing emissions, offering valuable insights for policymakers and industry leaders to adopt data-driven strategies that enhance energy efficiency and minimize environmental impact in Ecuador's oil sector.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.61368/r.s.d.h.v5i4.350</link>
      <description>Yuri Andr&#233; Ram&#237;rez Paliza, Pedro Abraham Torre Isla, Revista Cient&#237;fica de Salud y Desarrollo Humano. 5(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404001164

                Keloids and hypertrophic scars pose significant challenges in clinical management due to their propensity for recurrence and their impact on patient&#8217;s quality of life. This systematic review evaluates the efficacy of various treatment modalities for these scars, with an emphasis on clinical outcomes, symptom alleviation, and recurrence rates. A comprehensive literature search identified studies published between 2014 and 2024, encompassing randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Results indicate that advanced therapies, such as botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP), exhibit superior outcomes compared to traditional treatments, including triamcinolone acetonide (TAC), particularly concerning scar appearance and safety profiles. Furthermore, combination therapies, such as intralesional cryotherapy and CO2 fractional laser with intense pulsed light (IPL), demonstrated promising results in enhancing scar reduction and patient satisfaction. This review underscores the necessity of personalized treatment strategies tailored to individual patient requirements, taking into account factors such as scar characteristics and skin types. Future research should concentrate on optimizing treatment regimens to maximize efficacy while minimizing adverse effects, thereby ensuring long-term success in the management of keloids and hypertrophic scars.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17225535</link>
      <description>Barbara Klemczak, Beata Kucharczyk-Brus, Anna Sulimowska-Ociepka, Rafa&#322; Radziewicz-Winnicki, Energies. 17(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404115706

                The European Climate Law mandates a 55% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030, intending to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. To meet these targets, there is a strong focus on reducing energy consumption in buildings, particularly for heating and cooling, which are the primary drivers of energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, the demand for energy-efficient and sustainable buildings is increasing, and thermal insulation plays a crucial role in minimizing energy consumption for both winter heating and summer cooling. This review explores the historical development of thermal insulation materials, beginning with natural options such as straw, wool, and clay, progressing to materials like cork, asbestos, and mineral wool, and culminating in synthetic insulators such as fiberglass and polystyrene. The review also examines innovative materials like polyurethane foam, vacuum insulation panels, and cement foams enhanced with phase change materials. Additionally, it highlights the renewed interest in environmentally friendly materials like cellulose, hemp, and sheep wool. The current challenges in developing sustainable, high-performance building solutions are discussed, including the implementation of the 6R principles for insulating materials. Finally, the review not only traces the historical evolution of insulation materials but also provides various classifications and summarizes emerging aspects in the field.</description>

                Abstract Global warming is setting the whole world in a real challenge to select between, global economy and industry growth or environment protection. A commitment was set forth via COP organization requesting all countries to show progress and quantify decarbonization efforts. As opportunities always arise through difficulties and challenges, oil and gas industries in UAE found a series of innovative approaches where we can sustain our growth while meeting the decarbonization target. As drilling Rigs are representing one of the main diesel consumptions in oil field and hence Co2 emission, series of initiatives driven to pilot fit for purpose application to substitute diesel driven generator(s). Any initiative that leads to diesel consumption reduction will represent a building block toward the objective. However, most of them have been short to meet the decarbonization target set by UAE leadership (25% reduction by 2030). Solar energy and power storage batteries are on top of the pilots conducted but with limitations. Solar power generation requires a fixed setup / assets where nature of land rig is mobile however its very efficient and robust for fixed central camps. Power storing batteries are still limited to provide required range of energy to operate rigs independently or even partially. Dual fuel (Diesel and natural gas), biofuel and Hydrogen been on radar screen and assessed as well in this paper. Quick and low hanging fruit initiative where this case study about is to screen the existing power grid in our mature fields, quantify the spinning power per each power line and map the drilling location for the upcoming business plan hence evaluate the feasibility to connect rig directly to those power lines utilizing available spare power per each power line providing no future infrastructure or production facility is planned for this spare power.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Optimization and Impact Analysis of Energy Efficiency and Carbon Reduction in the High-Temperature Sintered Ore Production Process</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17225410</link>
      <description>Yuxing Yuan, Jingchao Sun, Lei Zhang, Su Yan, Tao Du, Hongming Na, Materials. 17(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404059314

                The coordinated optimization of energy conservation, efficiency improvement, and pollution reduction in the sintering production process is vital for the efficient and sustainable development of the sintering department. However, previous studies have shown shortcomings in the multi-objective collaborative optimization of sintering systems and the quantification of pollutant impacts. To address these, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization method integrated with the NSGA-III algorithm and establishes an integrated system optimization model for sintered ore production and high-temperature waste heat recovery. The results demonstrate significant improvements: energy utilization efficiency increased by 0.67%, energy consumption decreased by 17.3 MJ/t, production costs were reduced by 11.45 CNY/t, and the emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOx were reduced by 0.464 kg/t, 0.034 kg/t, and 0.008 kg/t, respectively. Additionally, the study identified optimal configuration parameters and analyzed the quantitative impact of several key factors on multiple indicators. The results also show that reducing the water content of the mixture, decreasing the middling coal content in the fuel, and increasing the thickness of the material layer are effective strategies to reduce energy consumption and pollutant emissions in the sintering process. Overall, implementing these optimizations can bring significant economic and environmental benefits to the steel industry.</description>

      <title>A Comparison Of Mosquito Species Assemblages Sampled With Three Commonly Used Traps And A Novel Design</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2987/23-7110</link>
      <description>Loyal P. Hall, Jiayue Yan, Chris Stone, Thomas C. Baker, Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404063929

                ABSTRACT In nuisance or vector mosquito management, effective sampling is a stepping stone to efficient use of resources, targeted control efforts, and successful reduction of disease transmission. Experimental evidence indicates that there are species biases for certain traps, which in turn implies that the traps used will influence the species make-up of samples collected. A comparative study between 3 CO2-baited light traps and 2 hay-infusion baited gravid traps&#8212;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light trap, American BioPhysics Company (ABC) light trap, Reiter-Cummings (RC) gravid trap, and a convertible gravid/light trap with a novel design&#8212;was conducted to test for species specificity of each trap type. It was found that different species of mosquitoes are more likely to be collected in greater numbers with certain traps compared to others, even between the different light traps or gravid traps. In particular, Coquillettidia perturbans tended to be collected in greater numbers with CDC light traps, Culex salinarius tended to be collected in greater numbers with the experimental convertible light traps, and Culex pipiens tended to be collected in greater numbers with the Reiters-Cummings gravid traps over the other traps included in the study (P &#8804; 0.05). The overall species richness of samples was comparable among trap types, with similar performance of the new trap designs as established designs (P &#8804; 0.05).</description>

                Abstract Polymer flood is a mature technology where it has been applied in several fields in the past decade in Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) whether in full field scale or pilot/trial scale and at different development concepts (vertical and horizontal polymer injection concepts). However, managing such opportunities to develop them at commercial scale competitively is still deemed to be a challenge especially in a dark brown field from Urban Plan, interface/stakeholders/risk management, contracting strategy and execution prospectives. For the field of subject in this paper, full field polymer development plan and concept selection was endorsed with the concept of developing the polymer project utilizing the existing wells stock drilled during the infill waterflooding phase. Polymer flood is scheduled to be on-stream in 2026 injecting polymer in 2 phases with over 100 polymer injectors in total. The field is a mature dark brown field in South of Oman with waterflood history of over 16 years. Due to the congested nature of the field, it was difficult to define a cost-effective polymer development concept for the entire field. More challenges were faced managing several complexities i.e technology maturation, resources constraint &amp; continuity, contracting strategy endorsement and managing different stakeholders integrating all interface aspects. However, with continuous persistence and innovation, the project has managed to mature total volume of ~ 6% increment with remarkable unit cost reduction (&amp;gt; 50%). Furthermore, additional opportunities were identified to reduce the Unit Technical Cost (UTC) further by 4&#8211;5 units cost toward execute phase mainly more efficient polymer facility and chemical costs through competitive contracting strategy and introduction of Category management (CM) approach with further scope optimizations. In terms of Green House Gases (GHG) reduction, the project has demonstrated CO2 reduction in the field to more than 50% compared to Field Infill Waterflood development. This is due to the polymer nature of reducing the water cut in the field and thus reducing the energy required for produced water handling at the surface. This paper will demonstrate the key Front End Development Management challenges, project risks/opportunities, stakeholders and interface management along with key steps made to efficiently manage validate/de-risk the proposed concepts before the full field implementation driven by Decision Quality (DQ) exercise. Moreover, it will demonstrate the capital efficiency journey to improve project competitiveness through an integrated subsurface and surface efforts along with optimized contracting strategy.</description>

                Abstract The marine industry, responsible for over 80% of global merchandise transport, significantly impacts environmental sustainability through greenhouse gas (GHG) and sulfur oxides (SOx) emissions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) targets a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050, necessitating cleaner technologies and low-carbon fuels. The IMO's MARPOL Annex VI regulations also mandate a global sulfur cap of 0.5% for marine fuels. Compliance options include low sulfur fuels or scrubbers, with over 5,000 vessels using scrubbers by 2023. Compliance poses challenges for refiners and shippers. On-ship scrubbing of exhaust SOx and CO2 offers an economical solution. Yet, existing ship scrubbers face drawbacks: towering size, weight, and poor efficiency. Enter HP-HiGAS, an innovative technology by Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), India, tailored for exhaust gas scrubbing. Utilizing a Rotating Packed Bed (RPB) with high surface area packing, HP-HiGAS leverages centrifugal forces to vastly enhance gas absorption and mass transfer rate. Successfully implemented at HPCL's Visakh Refinery, HP-HiGAS has demonstrated practical viability in removing H2S from refinery fuel gas. The technology's compact design and superior performance make it suitable for marine applications, offering a robust solution for decarbonizing and desulfurizing marine exhaust gases. By enabling the maritime sector to meet stringent environmental regulations, HP-HiGAS plays a crucial role in reducing the industry's environmental footprint and supporting global sustainability efforts.</description>

      <description>Hany Abdalla, F. Abdeljawed, L. Kriechbaum, C. G. Von Moy, N. Trofaier, M. Hunyadi-Gall, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404013986

                Abstract Integrating power from renewable energy sources (RES) into existing gas processing facilities to reduce their electricity and fuel consumption plays a crucial role in decarbonising the industry. However, the volatile nature and seasonal intensity fluctuations of RES introduce significant uncertainties when designing or optimising process facilities for technological and cost effectiveness to achieve the highest possible fuel and CO2 emission reduction. Detailed models and simulations based on historical weather and operational data supported by traditional engineering approaches and tools are required for this multidisciplinary iterative optimisation. With the initial project goal to create a technology blueprint for decarbonisation initiatives in the gas processing industry, a comprehensive case study focusing on the integration of an innovative solar thermal technology into the gas processing facility of the Nawara gas field in Tunisia was conducted. The study's novel core technology is an inflatable concentrating solar thermal collector of proprietary design that is made of recyclable plastics suitable for sunbelt conditions. The primary objective was to demonstrate the engineering approach required for its optimal integration into the facility's existing process heat supply system, consisting of a single gas-fired heater and multiple consumers at various temperature levels, to reduce overall fuel consumption and increase economic viability. Thermodynamic models of the solar thermal farm and its integration into the process heat cycle were developed for performing time series calculations based on hourly resolved historical heat demand and solar radiation data to investigate optimal system tie-in, sizing, and operation. Additionally, design-relevant parameters like media temperatures and volume flows were determined to assist a projected basic engineering phase. As the study showed, the substitution of heat from the natural gas-powered heater with energy from a solar thermal source is highly dependent on the design of the collector farm, its tie-in point, and the operational flexibility of the existing process heat supply system. During the evaluation of the various scenarios with different equipment sizes and integration approaches, fuel savings between 13 and 29% were attainable even without the implementation of a thermal energy storage unit for operation during nighttime. A follow-up risk assessment based on the study's results provided crucial insights into the operational aspects of the integration of the considered solar thermal technology, enabling significant risk reduction potential for the future development of respective assets. The case study is the first to examine the integration of solar thermal energy into a gas processing facility and is also the first commercial demonstration of the inflatable solar thermal collector technology at megawatt-scale.</description>

      <title>Design and Installation of an On-Demand Activated Electronic Liner Shoe Mitigates Risk of Differential Sticking and Eliminates Intervention Cost</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222814-ms</link>
      <description>Daniel Beaman, O. J. Al Ali, H. Abdalla, Moetaz Abdelghany, Dustin Young, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404013574

                Abstract This paper presents a case study of the first installation of an on-demand activated Remote Actuated Shoe (RAS) in offshore extended-reach wells. The Middle East operator faced challenges related to potential differential sticking while running lower completions in high overbalance conditions. To mitigate this risk, the liners were equipped with isolation-valve Inflow Control Devices (IVICD) and a system at the toe of the liner to allow circulation from the shoe. However, conventional ball drop-activated shoe valves proved unreliable and time-consuming, often leading to expensive interventions to close the liner shoe. In collaboration with the operator, the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) designed a fit-for-purpose RAS tailored to offshore applications. The RAS was programmed to close after measuring 400 psi above hydrostatic pressure for 45 minutes, providing an on-demand solution for immediate closing of the liner shoe after reaching total depth (TD). A ported bullnose with choke functionality was also designed to create the pressure increase during circulation to signal the RAS to close once at depth. Upon reaching TD with the lower completions, the wells were circulated for the prescribed 45 minutes before seeing the indication that the shoe had shut, and the completion was successfully set as per plans. The successful installation of the on-demand RAS resulted in significant cost savings, with $1 million saved in potential intervention costs and a reduction of 120 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions per well. Two offshore wells have been completed successfully so far using the on-demand RAS, leading to its adoption as the standard liner shoe for the operator's offshore extended-reach wells in these fields. This case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the on-demand RAS in mitigating risks associated with high overbalance conditions, differential sticking, and operational challenges during the installation of lower completions in offshore extended-reach wells. The findings highlight the potential for significant cost savings and environmental benefits through the adoption of innovative intervention less technology in oil and gas operations.</description>

                Abstract This paper demonstrates the real time challenges encountered during full-scale deployment of Produced Water Re-Injection in ADNOC Onshore's largest Oil Producing Field. The paper will illustrate the comprehensive detailing of substantial deployment milestones right from the selection, definition, evaluation, successful pilot demonstration and eventually to a full-scale produced water re-injection deployment of 100,000 Barrel/day. This paper also covers the design &amp; operations related key challenges encountered during the execution and states how challenges were tackled and converted to opportunities and waste stream was converted to a enabler for reservoir pressure support thus enhanced operational sustainability by eliminating the need of 2.5 MW/hr of electrical power and 18000 Metric Ton of CO2 / Year. Following challenges were encountered during the course of 100% PWRI deployment: Uncertainties in production profiles.Facilities Bottlenecking.Fluctuation in composition.Presence of schmoo.SIMOPS and Construction in brown field without compromising the integrity and sustainable production rates. The detailed selection process of various treatments options i.e. selection of reservoir and operating philosophy of full-scale deployment was executed in three stages: Sub-surface evaluation to benchmark the required produced water outlet specifications, to maintain sustained produced water reinjection without impacting the fracture growth.Modifications of Surface Installations and technological screening to ascertain the required produced water specification, along with the facilities hookup requirements, plot plans and piping network to handle the current volumes of produced water as well as predicted productions profiles to cater future requirements due to maturity of Field and Gas lift phase - II.Troubleshooting of uncertainties encountered, Identification of opportunities and realization in OPEX optimization, reduction in downtime and sustainability implications.The potential of produced water re-injection under the matrix and fractured injection conditions was evaluated. Following the quantification of reservoir rock mechanical properties, determination of stresses in the different formations and physical measurements from the core flood tests, predictive runs and sensitivities collection were utilized to finalize the mode of re-injection to be fractured injection. Facility was than designed and PWRI network was established to cater the current produced water volumes at central processing facility as wells as future foreseen till 2030, to ensure re-injection into the reservoir for reservoir pressure support. Shallow Aquifer water previously the premier source of reservoir pressure support was replaced in phased manner with Produced water volumes of up to 100,000 BWPD, which was being dumped in the disposal wells. 05 Electrical submersible pumps stopped with the change of source, resulting in saving of 1.6 MM USD in terms of power tariff and 18000 Metric Ton eq. CO2 / Year, facilitating ADNOC in decarbonization of operations, meeting sustainable operations mandates and concerning shallow aquifer reservoirs. This paper demonstrates the novel methods of addressing the challenges and uncertainties encountered during the full-scale deployment of Produced water for re-injection. It reflects how this operational philosophy can reduce the aquifer water consumption, increase the oil recovery factor, Decarbonize the Operations and slashes the operational costs. The paper will provide an insight about managing uncertainties, design bottlenecking and harnessing new technologies from the concept to full scale implementation covering all major phases e.g. Concept, PoC, Pilot Demonstration, Business Case Study, detailed engineering, on ground execution, realization fiscal benefits in terms of CAPEX, OPEX and value addition towards the ESG realization. The paper will highlight the lessons learned and the best practices for future replication by other Oil and Gas Producers.</description>

      <title>Field X's Journey to the Best-In-Class Performance, Using the Gap-To-Potential Approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222885-ms</link>
      <description>Ghosin Al Shukaili, Said Al Kindi, S. Al Riyami, Fahad Al Hatmi, Ajmed Al Ajmi, Yaqoob Al Riyami, Mehdi Al Lawati, Adnan Al Ghadani, Ahmed Ismail, Saif Almatroushi, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404013675

                Abstract Field X is the largest oil field in Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), with the most wells and the highest production. It is also a very mature field, with many old wells and aging facilities. This means that it is important to manage the field carefully to maintain production and prevent decline. In 2020, Field X's performance was below industry standards. The subsurface unscheduled deferment was on the rise (reaching 3.7% of total field potential in 2020), the artificial lift failure index was high (28%), the number of closed-in wells (CIW) with potential was high (9.1%), and the oil gain from optimization activities was low (3.1%). To improve performance, the team embarked on a journey towards WRFM Excellence. They used a Gap to Potential (GtP) benchmarking approach to identify and address performance gaps. The team successfully executed their strategy, and Field X's WRM performance is now best-in-class. This was achieved through effective collaboration between different departments, agile work processes, the use of technology, automation, and visual management. Between 2020 and 2023, there has been a dramatic improvement in Field X's performance. For example, the subsurface unscheduled deferment rate has decreased from 3.7% to 2.1%, and some fields have achieved ZERO unscheduled subsurface deferment. The artificial lift failure index has also dropped from 28% to 18%, and the CIW stock has dropped from 9.1% to 4.6%. The oil gain from Optimization has even doubled, from 3.1% to 7.2%. In addition to these performance improvements, the successful deployment of the GPT approach also had a positive impact on Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE), as all projects were executed safely with zero lost time injuries. Furthermore, the conversion of 40 wells from beam pump to Long Stork Unites LSU resulted in a 40% reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Overall, the results of the GPT approach in Field X are very impressive. The team was able to achieve significant improvements in performance, HSE, and sustainability. This is a great example of how the GPT approach can be used to improve the performance of oil and gas fields. This paper reports on the successful implementation of the Field X Gap-to-Potential (GPT) approach, resulting in best-in-class performance.</description>

      <title>A Fully Autonomous Flare Control Through Well Management System</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222294-ms</link>
      <description>Salma Alharthi, A. Alawi, A. Musalhi, Z. Al-lawati, A. Sulaimi, Nagendra Kumar, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404014561

                Abstract Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) is dedicated to implementing sustainable practices through digitalization of oil and gas operation, with a current focus on reducing hydrocarbon emissions. Corporate goal is to minimize emissions from Gas lift (GL) wells, ensuring environmental responsibility while maintaining production efficiency. To achieve production targets while preventing unnecessary flaring, high (Gas Oil Ratio) GOR wells are closed or partially choked by Operation engineers manually but being vigilant hasn't proven to give optimum results. This paper details the successful implementation of autonomous flare control at a single station utilizing a well management system (WMS). Following the effective execution of the Flare Limit Control project within the WMS, a comprehensive change management strategy was deployed. Operations engineers were empowered to configure, update, and remove wells from the automated flare control scope within the WMS. Autonomous well control was achieved through continuous flare monitoring in the WMS. High Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) wells were closed when the flare limit was exceeded, and the last closed wells were automatically reopened once the flare was reduced. Through meticulous analysis, significant improvements were noted in reducing hydrocarbon emissions, saving on deferment and huge time saving following the project's implementation. The total yearly benefit is estimated to be around 185,000 USD from increased wells' uptime and time saving from one station. An additional 0.08% cost saving is estimated from additional CAPEX to reduce CO2 emissions as per PDO corporate target. Following improvements have contributed to value estimation from automated flare control: 8% more uptime from wells which are part of flare control logic.4% engineers' time saving33% of flare reduction The Flare control HMI (Human Machine Interface) screen offers Operation engineers a user-friendly interface, equipped with essential and informative details. The interface empowers them to effectively control flare automatically, ensuring not only minimal emissions but also reducing deferment and time saving. The implementation of new technologies has supported in overcoming operational challenges and efficiently managing the flare. An autonomous and intelligent logic has been introduced for controlling flare in real-time taking a bold step in digital transformation journey of PDO.</description>

                Abstract As technology develops rapidly, petroleum industry needs to utilize these to develop operational models to limit personnel travelling to high HS&amp;E risk rigsite area to relatively safe controlled remote operation centers. Traditional manning is not effective anymore. CO2 emissions has reached alarming levels leading to global warming. This paper describes one innovative operating model which encompasses multi-skilled field crew, remote operations using digital and technology enablers. Detailed description focused on different case studies. An Integrated Multiservice model was developed. Step one was an in-depth risk assessment of the project. Next prepared RACI matrix for all personal involved in project either at rigsite or office. All tasks traditionally performed by service company engineer were analyzed, then identified which tasks need physical presence of engineer at the rigsite and which tasks can be performed remotely from remote operations center. Depending on location of crew - rigsite or remote center specific competency development plan was prepared. This led to forming Multiskilled service company crew at the rigsite- Field Professional (FPRO) who could now perform all physical tasks across all operations which reduced additional resources needed to travel during change in operations. It led to relocating set of skilled engineers at the remote operations center to execute the non-physical tasks. Field escalation process was developed to streamline the process and avoid communication barriers. Statement of requirement for connectivity to rig infrastructure for communication were defined. To test the robustness of the model it was implemented across different geographies (North Sea, Middle East and Latin America). Tested over different environments (onshore and offshore). Implementation on each project was successful. Lesson learnt from each project was shared across other projects improving overall service delivery. Successful transition of up to 50% tasks from rigsite to remote center was possible. POB reduction up to 67% was achieved in one case. Ability for one offshore customer to do SIMOPS (Simultaneous Operations) on old platform with POB issues was huge cost saving. North Sea customers experiencing frequent bad weather conditions benefitted from avoiding rig shutdown waiting on service company crew as operations were managed through remote center. FPRO were supported by Drilling contractor personal and remote professionals operating from remote center. One team mindset is the secret for the model's success. All 3 stakeholders (Operating company, Drilling Contractor &amp; Service company) worked together with a common purpose. Operators are now requesting to further optimize this model to gain more value. The next stage would cross train drilling contractor personal. Utilizing automation software in Drilling, fluid monitoring and cementing would drive further standardization and alignment with overall project objectives. This model is a stepping change in how operations will take place in future.</description>

                Abstract In general exploration &amp; appraisal of new reservoirs involves flaring operations. Well testing operation of sour wells by flaring or flowing through existing pipeline networks with limitations is always considered highly challenging in the brownfield. Ultra-sour appraisal well testing operation considered to be complex in nature and may be resulted serious concern due to toxic gasses and their immediate effects. The wells are in congested developed fields and special consideration regarding social risk analysis and mitigation to be considered for operations. Apart from social risk there could be flow assurance issues due to scale deposition in the surface network during testing. Therefore, it is required to test the facilities to handle high H2S reservoir and blending with the low H2S content stream. To appraise the ultra-sour reservoir, extensive HAZOP (Hazard and Operability study) reviews and a blending study were carried out in-house. Multiple blending scenarios were developed real-time to ensure that H2S &amp; CO2 remained within facilities limit. Below is the stepwise approach followed to achieve all objectives in line with our sustainability targets. Initial blending estimates based on Compositions and remote manifold stations (RMS's) / compression stations (Cs's) profiles. Proposed sour gas blending ratios are calculated in such a way so that the net effect of H2S at the compressor station common suction header (post mixing) will remain within limit, any increment shall be managed through negotiating production from less sour wells. Afterwards developing the baseline for the project, a detailed technical discussion was carried out with the downstream team. In this regard, the facility integrity team confirmed the integrity and adequacy of existing gas surface facilities &amp; compressors. A detailed HAZOP review was conducted on the temporary well testing set-up along with the flowline. All recommendations were closed out prior to operations commencement. As a study outcome operation, frequent sampling was recommended at compressor stations and remote manifolds. Detailed Social risk studies and social risk management were also part of project and all control were implemented prior to kick off the project. Multiple wells were successfully appraised along with the significant reduction of GHG emissions. Moreover, the appraisal wells were generating revenues as they were producing through the facilities. All objectives were in-line with our vision of 100x decarbonization, unconventional gas &amp; preserving the ecosystem. This paper will elaborate on the integrated &amp; excellent collaboration between upstream and downstream teams for inline testing of ultra-sour well without flaring considering the operational, Safety, and subsurface aspects. There are two important aspects of the case study. First Wells were commissioned and produced through facilities without any flaring operations which complimented the sustainability mandate. It created new venues for sour reservoir development and steps closer to gas self-sufficiency.</description>

      <title>A Deep Dive on the Global Outlook from Methane Emissions Monitoring in the Oil and Gas Industry, Using Data Insights from Satellites and Aircrafts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222037-ms</link>
      <description>Lola Odunsi, Mildred Violet Mueller, Mamdouh El Oufy, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404013503

                Abstract This paper examines the impact of satellites in orbit, in relation to methane emissions and net-zero goals. Leveraging insights from global mappers and point source satellites, it elucidates the valuable information obtained and its significance in the O&amp;G industry. Furthermore, this paper highlights the pioneering efforts of GHGSat in this field, its expansion into CO2 monitoring, along with advancements in quantification, detection threshold, spatial resolution, and the enhancements of its next generation aircraft sensor capabilities. This manuscript presents insights and data obtained from emissions monitoring satellites, with a focus on their role in mitigating emissions, understanding trends, and solving pertinent industry challenges. Utilizing a sophisticated data analytics Esri-based Arc-GIS platform, SPECTRA, GHGSat generates metrics that provide valuable insights into emissions monitoring. Key techniques employed include wide-area coverage, tip and cueing mechanisms, automation, and innovative processing capabilities to optimize observations and generated plumes. Additionally, statistical data and the distribution of global O&amp;G emissions, with specific attention to case studies from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. This presentation will reveal the critical importance of frequency of observations in the efficacy of emissions monitoring efforts, emphasizing the need for consistent and timely data collection. For example, GHGSat monitored 300% more observations in 2023 and more than 183MTCO2e emissions, 2.3 times increase in Oil and Gas detections, in comparison to 2022. This is attributable to its growing constellation and high spatial resolution of 25m, and detection threshold of 100 kg/hr. The insights provided by emissions monitoring satellites are instrumental in informing mitigation strategies, understanding emissions trends, and addressing industry challenges. Moreover, the involvement of satellite companies and advancements in satellite technology have significantly enhanced GHGSat's ability to monitor and address emissions in the O&amp;G industry. Regulatory compliance and International Frameworks for emission monitoring will also be discussed, and how source level measurements fit into the various scopes. GHGSat's top-down approach and its incorporation of its evergreening aircraft sensor solutions and developments for higher resolution (of less than 1m) and lower detection thresholds (down to 5 kg/hr) will be reviewed. This study underscores the invaluable contributions of emissions monitoring satellites in advancing sustainability efforts and shaping the future of the O&amp;G industry towards a greener and more sustainable trajectory. GHGSat, a pioneering force in this space, has notably launched 12 satellites between 2016 and 2023, with a significant influx occurring in 2023, and plans to deploy five more satellites starting in 2025. By harnessing the capabilities of satellite and aircraft sensor technologies for onshore and offshore monitoring, the Oil and Gas industry stands poised to make informed decisions, drive sustainable practices, and contribute to global efforts towards emissions reduction and environmental stewardship.</description>

      <title>Real Case Study Showcasing New Solution for Unplanned Stuck Pipe Events Using Remote Wireline Operations in Challenging North Sea Environment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/222741-ms</link>
      <description>J. Bruneau, Vinod Kumar, A. Elafifi, R. Gonzalez, A. Dixit, Magnus B&#229;ng, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404013626

                Abstract Stuck pipe events are a major challenge for oil and gas operators; they can occur during drilling, completion, or abandonment operations, and can put the whole well at risk. They are also one of the main sources of non-productive time, as recovering from such event is usually a lengthy process and tend to disturb the entire operation. In the North Sea, weather is unpredictable and logistics has been known to be challenging, leading to rigs shutting down while waiting on personnel and equipment, further delaying the return to normal. Utilizing wireline remote operations has had a massive impact on how fast the operations can be completed. It has saved days of waiting on weather, equipment, and personnel. Expert wireline engineers in the Remote Operations Center are available 24/7 and the required equipment, such as Mechanical Pipe Cutter and Downhole Electric Cutting Tool, are usually available at the rig site. A unique work model combining multiskilled personnel on offshore rigs along with remote professionals onshore is used, paired with digital technologies available in the market. Statement of requirement for connectivity and rig infrastructure for communication was defined. Detailed risk assessment was conducted in planning stage. RACI matrix involving all tasks at rig site or remote center were clearly defined. Escalation process was developed to have clear communication guidelines. This model was tested on multiple jobs with great success. The first ever fully remote operation using the Mechanical Pipe Cutter service in the North Sea was successful. In total, 5 cuts were completed remotely; the first 2 cuts were successful but didn&#8217;t result in being able to pull the pipe, due to damaged control lines downhole. After consulting with the operator, 3 more cuts were performed and the pipe was successfully pulled and laid down at surface. A tractor was used for conveyance, leading to integrating teams and prevented sending additional personal offshore. Post job data delivery to customer was done quicker, as remote engineers focused on data processing and delivery while the offshore personnel worked on rigging down tools and returning the well to customer. With over 60 jobs done successfully to date, our customers have saved huge costs. 25% reduction in personal on board was achieved leading to almost 2.5 ton of CO2 emissions saved. This was a first worldwide, as this service had never been run fully remote anywhere else. More logging units are getting upgraded with fiber connectivity to support future operations, and wellsite supervisors have been trained on this innovative approach. Strong horizontal knowledge transfer between rigs crews is possible by having 24/7 central support onshore. This paper will explain in detail the holistic approach in terms of technology development, multiskilled personnel and remote logging applications.</description>

                Abstract A new energy landscape has unlocked relevant opportunities, operators are more focused on energy efficiency to tackle emissions reduction and satisfy global Climate Change initiatives driven by the Paris Agreement. The future of the oil and gas industry depends on its ability to manage its carbon footprint, not only in scopes 1 and 2- but also in scope 3 emissions which require actions, oversight and shall bring changes to the overall value chain in different sectors and countries given the new ESG requirements and other relevant regulations. The logistics &amp; services (L&amp;S) sector involves operations along the entire oil &amp; gas value chain-onshore, offshore, shipping &amp; marine services. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the importance of scope 3 and determine its magnitude as L&amp;S advances in its sustainability journeys and include scope 3 in its future commitment. Given the complex nature of the oil and gas operations, a model was built to estimate carbon emissions in the shipping &amp; logistics segments associated with maritime transportation and logistics practices. Scope 3 emissions ~ 75-80% of lifecycle emissions connected with the end-users. According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the scope 3 emissions are not only significant but also increasing at an alarming rate- expected by up to 250% by 2050. The proposed methodology used is based on mixed methods, concerning literature review, benchmarking the L&amp;S world-leaders, interviews with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), and a quantitative model to define the magnitude of this scope in the sector's ecosystem. Accurate quantification of CO2 emissions equivalents along the hydrocarbon value chain is an important step to address the company's Sustainable Development Strategy and build a carbon-free future for new generations to come. The scope of every business unit was established to cover all scope 3, whereby 15 sub-categories were also established as a framework. The model outputs allow users to analyze the system's carbon intensity, raise alarms, and identify potential energy efficiency efforts and governance framework to be incorporated into the company's business plan and annual budget to reduce emissions based on their magnitude and climate impacts. Reporting scope 3 emissions across the supply chain, from production to consumption is a novel initiative, that aligns with International Oil Companies (IOCs)&#8217; best practices and L&amp;S global leaders in the market in addition to forthcoming regulatory obligations. Reducing emissions requires collaboration, an effective governance framework, and clear commitment among the company, regulators (e.g., IMO), and government. The UAE sustainability plans, and IMO stricter regulations are incentivizing the sector to meet ambitious goals by 2050. The global energy sector is shifting towards a more sustainable, environmentally friendly production and consumption of all energy sources, where scope 3 estimation represents an important step ahead. This common objective guides efforts at the sector level to become a decarbonization role model and hub in the region and promote more collaboration across its hydrocarbon value chain.</description>

                Abstract Implementing industrial scale technology and easily adoptable solutions in the field of Virtual Reality has been challenging for the energy industry. Designing and developing a solution to unlock the capability of engineers virtually meeting each other in 1:1 scale digital plant and executing a high-fidelity design review to make sure the design meets specified requirements and address any potential issues before release is the goal of this new technology development project. This project is a cross functional team effort including experts from plant design, project engineering, installation &amp; service engineering, quality, cyber security, enterprise architect and enterprise CAD systems. Well detailed Technology development roadmap and technology adoptability strategy was prepared defining the success criteria and validation of value proposition. The solution developed is a four-step process; 1) Data preparation 2) Data publish to server 3) Design review execution 4) Report generation. During data preparation phase project engineer will gather inputs for design review like 3D model, checklist, documents, team list and project information. This data is published to a cloud-based server using a web portal and CAD plugins without any data loss. Project engineer will then set up a 3D design review meeting and invite required attendees using the same solution. With this solution engineers located globally can join the virtual meeting with just one click using virtual reality headset and all participants can access the data published depending on access granted to them. The participants can virtually meet and discuss through representation of their avatars in real time and can perform the plant design review in 1:1 scale with high quality 3D visualization. Participants in the meeting can collaboratively simulate installation and maintenance sequence, check accessibility, measure dimensions and capture comments if any to make changes to design. The solution will automatically generate the report out and list of actions from the review. More than 150 engineers from about 10 industrial energy companies had the opportunity to test and use this solution. Many functionalities providing immersive user experience for industrial use cases were explored pushing the limits of VR. It was observed that we can reduce 50% of cost of quality related to field modifications. Further we can reduce 50% engineering 3D model rework by early identification of clashes in the model. This solution can also lead to 30% reduction in travel costs by adopting virtual meeting instead of physical meeting, eventually reducing CO2. It was concluded that design review performed in a virtual immersive environment, significantly improved the ability to ensure a flawless design that meets all the requirements and significantly improve the ability to communicate the design intent. As the organizations are moving towards more digital product and plant design, 3D models enriched with process, material, design information interlinked with various product life cycle management systems, makes use of virtual simulation tools inevitable. Further data captured from real operation of the plant can be used to optimize and improve various key elements by integrating with these 3D models moving to the real digital twin.</description>

                Abstract This work presents a review of the exploitation schemes applied and envisioned for the next 25 years in the Exploitation Plan for the Zuata Principal Field, located in the Jun&#237;n Block of "La Faja Petrol&#237;fera del Orinoco (FPO)", Venezuela. The relevance of Improved/Enhanced Oil Recovery (IOR/EOR) methods to increase the production/recovery factor of the area is highlighted, with recoverable reserves of 4,392 MMSTB and a current primary recovery factor of approximately 3.5% after more than 25 years of exploitation. In terms of field-scale IOR/EOR, the implementation of two main IOR projects is highlighted: Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) and Downhole Electrical Heating (DEH) through an electro-resistive heating cable, executed between 2010-2018; as well as the visualization of the application of Chemical EOR (CEOR) methods (e.g., surfactants and polymers) in areas of the reservoir where the implementation of thermal methods is not feasible. The comprehensive methodology of the CSS Project included well pre-selection, numerical reservoir simulation, infrastructure analysis, area prioritization, economic considerations, and implementation. Similarly, the DEH Project focus on selecting prospective wells based on criteria adapted to the study area, economic premises, and field implementation of the technology. Finally, for evaluating CEOR methods (surfactants and polymers), a first phase involved pilot area selection, fluid sampling, and laboratory testing. This will serve as the basis for the pilot field test feasibility evaluation phase. The findings of this study indicate that 19 CSS activities were carried out during the 2013-2018 period, with cumulative injection volumes ranging from 7,500 to 10,000 tons/cycle. Production increases of up to 365% were observed, with thermal effect durations ranging from 12 to 16 months. The effectiveness of the CSS method was evaluated using two operational indicators: "Incremental Np" and "Steam to Oil Ratio (SOR)", both of which yielded favorable results. Furthermore, between 2010 and 2018, DEH systems were installed in 23 wells, which is considered a technological substitute as a pre-CSS scheme or in cases where CSS processes are not technically feasible. Incremental productions of 20% to 60% were achieved, with operating powers of up to 55 kW. Regarding the application of CEOR methods, the injection of polymers and surfactant-polymers could potentially increase hydrocarbon recovery in the area (up to 90% at the laboratory scale for the SP case) with a lower environmental impact compared to thermal methods, specifically in terms of water consumption (for steam generation) and acid gas emissions (e.g., CO2 and H2S). Depending on the type of chemical used, recovery mechanisms such as mobility control, interfacial tension reduction, ions exchange (low salinity of injected water), and/or changes in wettability could impact hydrocarbon recovery. This novel study provides an exhaustive compilation of the experiences and best operational practices derived from the field applications of the main IOR/EOR projects executed in the Zuata Principal Field, allowing solid conclusions to be drawn about the oil-exploitation potential of the area. The optimization and/or application of new schemes in the implemented methods are also envisioned. Additionally, several outstanding studies concerning other IOR/EOR methods applicable to the area, such as Chemicals, Hybrids (e.g., thermo-chemicals), are listed, supporting their continuation.</description>

The review is devoted to the current environmental problem - a reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. A significant proportion of carbon is known to be deposited in the soil cover. Measures are being discussed in a many countries to promote carbon sequestration depending on the land use, because soils and forests, along with the world&#8217;s oceans, are the main stores of CO2. Different land use issues (virgin lands, arable land, pasture and forest lands) are covered in connection with the problem of greenhouse gas emissions. Data on the land cultivation: zero; standard with and without plant residues; using biochar; microalgae are given. A comparative analysis using biomarkers on a pasture with mixed herbage, arable land with rapeseed, soil under willow have been considered in order to determine microorganisms assimilating carbon from rhizosphere deposits of various plants. Some sources evident the hydrolysable lipids constitute a high share of the soil organic carbon (SOC) accumulation in forests, in contrast to phenols of lignin. The former substances are actively accumulated with the decreasing of soil pH, increasing of reactive iron, aluminum, and lignin oxidation. SOC is higher in a silt and clay fractions as compared to the sandy ones due to it absorbance in aggregates. Hence, it was proposed to use the finely dispersed mineral fraction as a key element to determine carbon stabilization in most soils. Carbonates play an important role in carbon sequestration, accounting for approximately 40 % of carbon stored in the world soils. They are the main component of carbon storage in arid regions. Attention to the radical improvement of pastures is given - inversion treatment (FIT). The methodical issues to detect SOC by remote distance (RD) technique are given. Reflected shortwave radiation in the upper atmosphere (TOA) practice has shown a great potential for climate mitigation through the cultivation of a cover crop with high albedo and a lack of chlorophyll.</description>

                Abstract Phase alteration is a physical phenomenon that constantly takes place in reservoirs, during production or injection, due to the regional change in fluids&#8217; pressures or temperatures. The transformation of phases also occurs frequently in enhanced oil recovery (cold solvent injection, CO2 injection, etc.) or thermal enhanced oil recovery (steam injection, solvent-thermal application) at which injected fluids condense gradually throughout the matrix owing to heat loss or an increase in pressure. Achieving an accurate prediction of phase change in the porous media is important for attaining trustful forecasting of hydrocarbon recoveries, retrieval of the injected solvents, vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations, and modelling of two-phase envelopes. Generally, the capillary effect has an impact on the properties of fluids when medium sizes are tight enough to affect the molecules and empower pore-molecule interactions. One of the fluid properties influenced by high capillary pressures is the phase-change. When pore sizes become tighter than 100 nanometers, vaporization and condensation temperatures/pressures of confined fluids tend to shift from bulk measurements. Understanding the nature of physical state alteration (liquid-to-gas or vice versa) has attracted the attention of researchers because of its enormous importance in pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) calculations and reservoir simulation. In petroleum industries, cubic equation-of-state (EoS) models are used to predict the phase behavior of hydrocarbons in the reservoirs. One of the major limitations of the commonly used cubic EoS (Peng-Robinson EoS and Soave Redlich-Kwong EoS) is that they do not consider the confinement effect on the phase-alteration behavior of fluids. Such a drawback causes these cubic models to be inaccurate in modelling two-phase envelopes of rock fluids in extended tight reservoirs (shales, tight sands) or even in permeable rocks (sands under thermal injection). This paper experimentally investigates the phase-change behavior of hydrocarbons in various categories of the porous system. The experimental journey was initiated by studying the boiling behavior of single-component hydrocarbon liquids in silica-glass Hele-Shaw cells which is represented as simple capillary spaces with different sizes. Shifted boiling temperatures were observed in the glass cells, due to the confinement effect. As a next step, the vaporization of hydrocarbons was analyzed in homogeneous and heterogeneous silicate-glass microfluidic chips. Early vaporizations of solvents were observed in the micromodels, as a result of capillary effects in the porous systems. The analysis was shifted forward to focus on the phase-change behavior of hydrocarbons in real reservoir rocks. Owing to the existence of nanopores, the vaporization of tested liquids took place in the rocks at temperatures lower than normal boiling points and calculated boiling temperatures by the Thomson equation. Such reductions were also observed in the permeable rocks although the volume percentages of extended confined pores (&amp;lt; 100 nanometers) were less than 5%. The second set of experiments paid attention to measuring the vaporization temperature of single-component and multicomponent hydrocarbon liquids in different rocks at various pressures. The pure-component solvents were representing the injected solvents in cold solvent injection or as additives to steam, and the multicomponent solvents were representing non-complex light oil. The experimental results were, then, compared with the normal boiling points and calculated phase-change temperatures by the original version of the Peng-Robinson EoS. Noticeable deviations of measured vaporization temperatures of liquid solvents from the bulk and computed values were observed. As the medium gets smaller, interior pore surfaces begin to have influences on boiling temperatures of hydrocarbons, due to the pore-molecule interactions. Studying the condensation of propane in various reservoir rocks under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions was also a part of the investigation. The vaporization of propane was inspected in different rocks at various temperatures. The experimental observations were then compared with the bulk vaporization pressures and computed saturation pressures by the Peng-Robinson EoS and Kelvin equation. The recorded vapor pressures, in the rocks, were 7% lower than the bulk values and calculated vapor pressures by the Kelvin equation. Meanwhile, the propane vapor pressures, in the rocks, were 15% (on average) lower than the pressures modelled by the Peng-Robinson EoS.</description>
