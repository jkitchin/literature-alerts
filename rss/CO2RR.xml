                Li&#8211;CO2 batteries have received significant attention owing to their advantages of combining greenhouse gas utilization and energy storage. However, the high kinetic barrier between gaseous CO2 and the Li2CO3 product leads to a low operating voltage (&lt;2.5 V) and poor energy efficiency. In addition, the reversibility of Li2CO3 has always been questioned owing to the introduction of more decomposition paths caused by its higher charging plateau. Here, a novel "trinity" Li&#8211;CO2 battery system was developed by synergizing CO2, soluble redox mediator (2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidoxyl, as TEM RM), and reduced graphene oxide electrode to enable selective conversion of CO2 to Li2C2O4. The designed Li&#8211;CO2 battery exhibited an output plateau reaching up to 2.97 V, higher than the equilibrium potential of 2.80 V for Li2CO3, and an ultrahigh round&#8208;trip efficiency of 97.1%. The superior performance of Li&#8211;CO2 batteries is attributed to the TEM RM&#8208;mediated preferential growth mechanism of Li2C2O4, which enhances the reaction kinetics and rechargeability. Such a unique design enables batteries to cope with sudden CO2&#8208;deficient environments, which provides an avenue for the rationally design of CO2 conversion reactions and a feasible guide for next&#8208;generation Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.</description>

      <title>Study on the Inhibition of Hydrogen Evolution Reaction by Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Using Elsholtzia Harchowensis Biochar</title>

                With the widespread application of plant remediation technology in the field of soil remediation, there was an increasing stock of hyperaccumulating plant tissues containing heavy metals, but there was currently a lack of effective disposal methods. In the preliminary research process, researchers used the copper hyperaccumulating plant Elsholtzia Harchowensis to prepare biochar material electrodes and successfully used them in the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) process. Due to the previous research being conducted in aqueous solutions, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the working electrode surface has a certain impact on the Faraday efficiency (FE) of carbon-containing products. In order to further improve the electrocatalytic reduction performance of biochar materials, this study was based on B- and N-doped biochar prepared from Elsholtzia Harchowensis as raw material. The influence mechanisms of electrode surface hydrophobicity and electrolyte components (PC/water) on the CO2RR and HER were studied, respectively. After dropwise coating PTFE on the surface of Cu/C-BN material, the hydrophobicity of Cu/C-BN-PT material was improved, and the effect on the active sites of the catalyst was relatively small without changing the structure and elemental characteristics of the original electrode. In a 1.0 M KHCO3 solution, the Faraday efficiency of H2 in Cu/C-BN-PT material decreased by 20.1% compared to Cu/C-BN at &#8722;0.32 V (vs. RHE), indicating that changing the hydrophilicity of the material can significantly inhibit the HER. In a solution of PC/water at a ratio of 9:1 (V:V), the FE of converting CO2 to methane (CH4) at &#8722;0.32 V (vs. RHE) reached 12.0%, and the FE of carbon monoxide (CO) reached 64.7%. The HER was significantly inhibited, significantly improving the selectivity of electrocatalytic CO2.</description>

      <title>Engineering hydrophobicity and high-index planes of gold nanostructures for highly selective electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO and efficient CO2 capture</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.150045</link>

                In current study, we demonstrate a strategy for improving the catalytic performance of gold (Au) for carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), specifically enhancing selectivity for CO over hydrogen reduction reaction (HER) and increasing low-level CO2 capture efficiency. This involved controlling nanostructures without any further modification. Au nanostructures having four different morphologies (i.e., degree of roughness) were fabricated via electrodeposition at varied deposition potential, resulting in different intrinsic surface hydrophobicity and exposure of high-index planes depending on the actual morphology. The roughest Au, with its combination of the most hydrophobic feature and abundant high-index planes, generated greater current density (jCO) and faradaic efficiency for CO (FECO) than the other Au deposits within a tested potential region: The roughest Au showed 6-fold higher FECO (95.8 %) and 327-fold higher jCO (normalized to electrode geometric surface area) at &#8722;0.75 VRHE compared to the smoothest Au. Moreover, the roughest Au exhibited excellent CO2 capture ability even at low CO2 concentration, confirmed with scanning electrochemical microscopy. These improvement at hierarchical Au for CO2RR could be ascribed to two factors. Firstly, the morphology-driven hydrophobicity provides an optimal gas&#8211;liquid-solid triple-phase interfaces, increasing the local CO2 concentration near the Au catalyst surface due to its superb CO2 capture ability. Secondly, the abundant high index plane serves as stable active sites for CO2RR, expediting the reaction rates. Remarkably, Au with the highest hydrophobicity and enriched high-index planes, even without any chemical modification, showed excellent CO2RR catalytic performance comparable to or even better than the other previously reported Au-based catalysts.</description>

                The activity and product selectivity of electrocatalysts for reactions like the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) are intimately dependent on the catalyst&#8217;s structure and composition. While engineering catalytic surfaces can improve performance, discovering the key sets of rational design principles remains challenging due to limitations in modeling catalyst stability under operating conditions. Herein, we perform first&#8208;principles density functional calculations adopting implicit solvation methods with potential control to study the influence of adsorbates and applied potential on the stability of different facets of model Cu electrocatalysts. Using coverage dependencies extracted from microkinetic models, we describe an approach for calculating potential and adsorbate&#8208;dependent contributions to surface energies under reaction conditions, where Wulff constructions are used to understand the morphological evolution of Cu electrocatalysts under CO2RR conditions. We identify that CO*, a key reaction intermediate, exhibits higher kinetically and thermodynamically accessible coverages on (100) relative to (111) facets, which can translate into an increased relative stabilization of the (100) facet during CO2RR. Our results support the known tendency for increased (111) faceting of Cu nanoparticles under more reducing conditions and that the relative increase in (100) faceting observed under CO2RR conditions is likely attributed to differences in CO* coverage between these facets.</description>

                The cement industry is a major source of carbon dioxide and air pollutant emissions. This study developed a high-resolution emission inventory for China's cement industry and forecasted emissions from 2025 to 2035. The results showed that emissions in 2020 were 251, 709, 142, and 1.35 &#215; 106 Gg for SO2, NOx, PM2.5, and CO2, respectively. The optimal model projections for 2035 showed that fuel and clinker substitutions had the best reduction effect on SO2 and CO2, with average reduction rates of &#8211;11.42 % and &#8211;7.37 %, respectively, compared to the 2035 frozen scenario. Pollutant control measures and clinker substitution had the best emission reduction effect on NOx and PM2.5, and the average reduction rates were &#8211;26.09 % and &#8211;4.23 %, respectively, compared to the 2035 frozen scenario. These results showed that the substitution of fuel and clinker has important co-benefits for air pollutants in the cement industry.</description>

                The escalating levels of carbon dioxide in flue gas and the resultant greenhouse effect have heightened the need for adsorbents with high CO2 sorption and separation capabilities. However, Traditional heated synthesis methods are energy-intensive and often involve toxic solvents, which are not viable for widespread industrial use. This study introduces a room-temperature, eco-friendly synthesis technique to produce UiO-66-(OH)2 with varying amounts of PVP (0/0.1/0.2 g), effectively adjusting the particle morphology. Results confirm that this method maintains robust CO2 adsorption and selectivity. Notably, the addition of 0.1 g of PVP led to a reduction in pore size and adsorption capacity of CO2, yet remarkably enhanced its CO2/N2 separation performance sixfold, outperforming traditional CO2 adsorbents. Dynamic breakthrough experiments further validated the effectiveness of UiO-66-(OH)2 in separating binary mixtures of CO2/N2 (v/v = 15/85).</description>

                Abstract In the context of carbon capture and storage (CCS), the presence of impurities, such as Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S), in the injected Carbon Dioxide (CO2) stream poses a significant challenge (Bennion and Bachu, 2008). This challenge is particularly pronounced in carbonate reservoirs due to the potential precipitation of the minerals (Ahmad et al., 2023). Such precipitation can have detrimental effects on carbonate rock properties, including a reduction in rock porosity and permeability (Labus &amp; Suchodolska, 2017; Clark et al., 2018). Ultimately, these changes can impact injectivity and storage capacity (Wang et al., 2012; (Zaidin et al., 2018), making it essential to comprehend the geochemical reactions involved, which are demonstrated as follows:</description>

      <title>From Drilling to Production: Digital Solutions for Automation and Remote Operations in the Amazon Region</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2523/iptc-23887-ms</link>

                Abstract In a brown field with over 50 years of production in the middle of the Amazon region, it is essential to optimize the operational processes from drilling to the real-time production monitoring, as well as to improve the speed of decision making to minimize downtimes, non- productive times (NPTs), maximizing production and the return of investment of an asset, and reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. By applying multi-domain digital solutions to automate the drilling operations to bring oil to production earlier and to remotely operate and monitor an artificial lifted system, optimizing production, and providing better decision making, these objectives were successfully achieved, establishing an integrated digital solution that generates tangible values to the operation. The rig automation with a digital solution uses a goal-based approach to handle constantly changing drilling conditions and repetitive tasks such as pre and post connection procedures without the constant need of human intervention. It commands the rig control system to control the surface equipment within the context of standard operating procedures incorporated into the system configuration. Its powerful data analysis and learning systems assist and enhance every task. Once the well is drilled and completed, the installation of gateways that applies cloud and edge computing, has enabled the field team to remotely start up the artificial lift equipment, real-time monitoring, run automated workflows and more effective decision-making to troubleshoot bottlenecks. This has unlocked remote operations to improve production, reduce downtimes, CO2 emissions, and safety-related events. Since 2021 the Operator has drilled 25 wells applying a digital solution for rig automation and has also changed the drillers training, resulting in an average reduction of 46% in pre-post connection times, an 2% increase in on-bottom rate of penetration (ROP), a total saved time of 27.22 days, and an average 82% drilling in automated mode, enabling the field to bring production forward and improve its performance and also reducing 1014 tons of CO2. Since 2020 the asset has implemented gateways to supervise 270 producer wells and several surface equipment's. This has granted the field team the chance to carry out an average of 2,800 remote operations and 2,100 alerts per year, which has had an effect of 1200 barrels of oil per month saved from the related activities and a travel reduction of 72,000 kms per year and a decrease of 60.5 tons of CO2, improving the process efficiency by 96% and increasing personnel efficiency by 17%, generating available man-hours to improve other activities. This successful showcase of the potential of Digital Transformation in the oilfield illustrates how digital tools can help to optimize efficiency and early production, decrease downtime, reduce the carbon footprint, minimize operational risks, and cut costs, making it a game changer for the oil and gas industry.</description>

                Given the increasing integration of building photovoltaics and the accelerated transformation of power systems, the supply-demand imbalance in photovoltaic communities has become a pressing issue. This study presents a novel optimization model for collaborative planning and scheduling. The alternating direction multiplier method is utilized to derive an optimal economic scheduling strategy for the community cooperative alliance, while ensuring private information protection. Additionally, the genetic algorithms are employed to ascertain the optimal configuration. The optimization model prioritizes the common good over individual interests in community cooperation alliances, meaning some members may need to compromise their self-interest to attain optimized overall benefits. Therefore, a compensation mechanism based on the Nash negotiation principle is established to ensure fair distribution of benefits. The simulation results demonstrate that the primary energy saving rate, annual cost saving rate, and carbon dioxide emission reduction rate of the photovoltaic community alliance are 42.91%, 32.50%, and 41.81%, respectively, and the self-consumption level of photovoltaic is vastly improved to 98.83% on a typical winter day. The sensitivity analysis illustrates that the photovoltaic panels in buildings contribute to a decrease in energy consumption and carbon emission by 25.57% and 26.15%, respectively. In contrast, they result in a cost increase of 11.05%.</description>

      <description>K.Y. Park, Wontae Lee, Journal of Korean Society of Environmental Engineers. 46(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392196817

                Objectives:This study compared greenhouse gas emissions from various biological treatment processes at wastewater treatment plants in City A, Gyeongsangbuk-do. Methods:Four wastewater treatment plants were selected by size and treatment process, and flow rate and water quality parameters from 2020 to 2022 were used. The amount of greenhouse gases such as methane, nitrous oxide, and carbon dioxide generated was calculated according to the IPCC and Ministry of Environment calculation formulas. Results and Discussion:Regardless of the biological wastewater treatment processes, the greenhouse gas emissions of all plants were higher according to the Ministry of Environment standards than the IPCC method. However, this may be because it was not applied to variables that are difficult to confirm, such as correction coefficients. Among biological treatment processes, the greenhouse gas emissions of A2O were higher than those of SBR.Conclusion:The results of this study can be used to calculate greenhouse gas emissions from biological wastewater treatment processes and prepare their reduction plans.</description>

      <title>Air pollution and economic growth in Dubai a fast-growing Middle Eastern city</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aeaoa.2024.100246</link>
      <description>Heba Akasha, Omid Ghaffarpasand, Francis D. Pope, Atmospheric Environment: X. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392203908

                This paper discusses the impact of rapid economic development on air quality in the Emirate of Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Dubai is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, with a population increase of approximately 80 &#215; over the last 60 years. The concentrations of five criteria air pollutants (CAPs) including carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter smaller than 10 &#956;m (PM10), ozone (O3) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) were studied from 2013 to 2021 at 14 regulatory monitoring stations. Results show that the biggest improvements in air pollution are for the primary air pollutants NO2 and SO2, with reductions of 54% and 93% respectively over the period studied. Gross domestic product (GDP), population growth and energy consumption are significantly and negatively correlated with NO2 and SO2 and strongly and positively correlated with PM10. CO is positively correlated with the number of buildings completed, while the results for O3 are inconclusive. Trends in PM10, NO2 and SO2 indicate that these two pollutants are decoupled from economic development, supporting, with caution, the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis on the relationship between economic growth and environmental degradation. The improvement in the city's air quality is due to the effective implementation of local environmental policies, unaffected by large-scale development and urbanization. The monthly assessments of Dubai's air pollution for 2019 and 2020 show a 3&#8211;16% COVID-related improvement in the levels of the studied air pollutants, except for ozone, which increased by an average of 8%.</description>

      <title>Ce-doping enhanced ORR kinetics and CO2 tolerance of Nd1-Ce BaCoFeO5+ (x = 0&#8211;0.2) cathodes for solid oxide fuel cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.02.325</link>
      <description>Mingcun Chen, Haixia Zhang, Chuangang Yao, Hao Liang, Zhe Zhang, Baojia Xia, Yuxi Sun, Xiaoma Wang, Xiaoshi Lang, Kedi Cai, Ceramics International. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392202770

                Addressing challenges in oxygen reduction efficiency and CO2 endurance is essential for advancing the electrochemical energy conversion performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). This investigation introduces an innovative strategy by employing Ce doping to enhance the oxygen reduction kinetics and CO2 resistance of NdBaCoFeO5+&#948; (NBCF) cathodes. Ce doping effectively regulates the oxygen vacancy content, the ratio of Co3+/Co4+ and Fe3+/Fe4+ in NBCF, leading to substantial improvements in oxygen exchange, lattice diffusion, and charge transfer processes. Consequently, a significant enhancement in the oxygen reduction reaction catalytic activity and CO2 endurance is achieved. At 800 &#176;C, the introduction of 10 mol% Ce doping results in a 65.3% reduction in Rp, reaching 0.024 &#937; cm2. Simultaneously, the power density experiences a 50.8% enhancement, reaching 1.0 W cm&#8722;2. The current investigation presents a novel avenue towards the advancement of next-generation high-efficiency and stable cathode materials for SOFCs.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Liquid, Supercritical CO2, CH4, and CO2/CH4 Mixture to Improve Oil Recovery</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2523/iptc-24523-ms</link>
      <description>Khaled Enab, Thomas Elizondo, Youssef Elmasry, Laura Lorena D&#237;az Flores, Alfred Addo-Mensah, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392187688

                Abstract This study investigates the efficiency of injecting CO2 and CH4 in improving oil production from black oil reservoirs. While prior research highlights the effectiveness of these gases in enhancing oil recovery factors, comparing their performance in bulk interaction to their performance in the porous medium is scarce. Furthermore, the impact of the physical state of the injected CO2&#8212;liquid, gas, or supercritical&#8212; on oil extraction mechanisms still needs to be explored. Hence, our study aims to bridge this gap through a comprehensive experimental analysis of gas-oil interactions in the bulk phase and within porous media. The bulk gas-oil interactions were investigated using a visual Pressure Volume Temperature (PVT) cell. In contrast, the gas-oil interaction within the porous media was investigated using a coreflooding experimental approach. The proposed investigation is designed to evaluate the influence of the permeability on the gas-oil interactions and the effect of the physical state of the injected fluid &#8212;liquid, gas, or supercritical &#8212; on the gas miscibility in oil. Since viscosity reduction and oil swelling are the primary mechanisms for miscible gas Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), this study focuses on the efficiency of different injected gases and the physical state of CO2 on the swelling factor, saturation pressure alternation, and viscosity reduction. The swelling factor and saturation pressure curves were measured when different molecular percentages of gas above the minimum miscible pressure were mixed with oil. The viscosity reduction effect was calculated by comparing the viscosity of the oil produced from the coreflooding experiment to the viscosity of the original oil. The oil minimum miscible pressure (MMP) of each considered gas in the oil sample was determined based on the oil composition determined by Gas Chromatography (GC) analysis. The results showed that the CO2/CH4 mixture outperformed CO2 liquid, supercritical, and CH4 in coreflooding experiments. Additionally, the coreflooding experiments proved liquid CO2 (Cold) performed better in improving oil recovery than supercritical CO2. However, the bulk PVT analysis revealed a higher swelling factor for supercritical than liquid CO2, which suggests supercritical CO2 outperforms other gases, including cold CO2. In contrast, the viscosity of the produced oil when supercritical CO2 was injected was lower than that of all other gases. The observed variation in CO2 performance indicates the significant role of CO2 physical state of CO2 in the oil extraction mechanism. The conclusion of this study provides a better understanding of the performance of different gas injection strategies in conventional reservoirs, which brings insights into optimizing gas injection into depleted oil reservoirs that contain dead oil.</description>

                This study investigated the implementation of solar panels in the Dumai Islamic Centre (DIC) Mosque, located in Dumai City, Riau Province, to reduce carbon emissions. The study presents an overview of the significance of solar energy utilization and its potential benefits in the context of mosque buildings. This research was aimed to assess the criteria for selecting the appropriate solar panel type, determine the power output and PV area required for the DIC Mosque, and estimate the carbon emissions reduction resulting from installing solar panels. The study employed a quantitative research design and utilizes the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to select the most suitable solar panel type. The results reveal that polycrystalline solar panels are the optimal choice based on efficiency, power peak, operation and maintenance, and price criteria. Installing solar panels on the DIC Mosque's roof, positioned at an optimal height, ensures maximum sunlight exposure and energy generation efficiency. Calculations demonstrate a significant reduction in carbon emissions post-installation. The carbon emissions reduction potential is estimated at 57.693 kg CO2 eq per day or 21,057.95 tons CO2 eq per year. This highlights the positive environmental impact of solar energy implementation in the DIC Mosque.</description>

      <title>Inhibition of autotrophic nitrifiers in soil by elevated CO2</title>

                Abstract Autotrophic nitrifiers, by catalyzing the oxidation of ammonia to nitrate, play a vital role in the global nitrogen cycle 1&#8211;5 . They convert carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into biomass 1,3,6 and, therefore, are expected to respond positively to increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations 1,3,6 . However, in a long-term free-air CO 2 enrichment experiment, we demonstrated that elevated atmospheric CO 2 inhibited the growth of autotrophic nitrifiers, resulting in a reduction in nitrification in a rice ecosystem. By coupling stable isotope probing with metagenomics, we found that the CO 2 inhibition of nitrifiers was mainly a consequence of CO 2 -induced functional loss (that is, incapable of recovering genomes) of dominant but previously uncharacterized autotrophic nitrifying species, especially those of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, which comprised 63% of total dominant members identified from the active nitrifying communities. We further found that the loss of these novel nitrifying species under elevated CO 2 was due largely to the CO 2 -induced aggravation of anoxic stress in the paddy soil. Our results provide insight into the fate of inorganic nitrogen pools in global lowland soil and water systems under future climate change scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reducing CO2 Emissions During Wellbore Cleanout Operations by Employing Coiled Tubing Fluid Oscillation Tool &#8211; A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2523/iptc-23676-ms</link>
      <description>Hossam A. Elmoneim, Abu Yousuf, Khurram Shahzad, Rehan Anwar, Saad Yousaf Khokhar, Marium Saeed, Syed Hashim Ali Inam, Muhammad Sana-ul-Hussnain, Imran Shafee, Muhammad Usman Haider, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392189208

                Abstract During 2022, oil and gas operations resulted in emission of 5.1 billion tons of CO2equivalent. These emissions must be reduced on the journey towards net zero emission. Wellbore cleanout operations with coiled tubing are one of the most frequent operations performed during the life of a wellbore. The coiled tubing and associated equipment used for wellbore cleanout operations is powered by diesel engines which result in high CO2 emission during operation. However, these emissions can be reduced by using a fluid oscillation tool. A fluid oscillation tool converts kinetic energy of the pumped fluid into potential energy resulting in the creation of pulsating waves. These pulsating waves induce cyclic stress in the scale. Continuous cyclic stress induces fatigue failure in the scale which ultimately leads to disintegration of the scale present in the wellbore or critical matrix. Fluid oscillation tools can remove scales in less time and provide better fluid velocities in the wellbore even in nitrified treatments. This ultimately reduces the time of operation considerably. Furthermore, reduction in operational time corresponds to low consumption of diesel by the CT and associated equipment, leading to lesser emission of CO2. A fluid oscillation tool was employed at multiple wells in the region of this case study to perform wellbore cleanout jobs. This paper thoroughly performs data analysis of four different wells and demonstrates the impact of fluid oscillation tool on different performance factors. Using a fluid oscillation tool led to a decrease in CO2 emission between 35-62%, reduced CAPEX between20-47% and increased production between 170-310%. Nearly 57% of the well intervention operations performed in the region of this case study are wellbore cleanout operations. Replacing the conventional jetting tool with a fluid oscillation tool led to a decrease in CO2 emission from 1843 Tons to 924 Tons. This reduction corresponds to approximately 50% of CO2 emission during wellbore cleanout operations. The scale of this reduction would be more appreciable when adopted universally.</description>

      <title>Tungsten-doped high-silica CHA zeolite membranes with improved hydrophobicity for CO2 separation</title>

                High-silica CHA (SSZ-13) zeolites membranes, with pore size between the molecular size of CO2 and N2 or CH4, are promising for some industrial CO2 separation process. Considering water is typically present in these industrial gas feed and the negative impact of moisture on the membranes&#8217; gas permeation, it is highly desirable to increase the surface hydrophobicity of membranes to reduce the adsorption of water. In this paper, a W-doping strategy was proposed to increase the hydrophobicity of SSZ-13 membranes by eliminating the silanols on the surface, and the W-doped high-silica CHA (W-SSZ-13) zeolite membranes were prepared for the first time. Characterizations such as SEM, XRD, and XPS confirmed the successful incorporation of W into CHA membrane. The incorporation of W reduced the pore mouth size, and the W-SSZ-13 zeolite membranes showed improved CO2/N2 and CO2/CH4 separation performance. After W-doping, the maximum separation factors (&#945;max) for the CO2/N2 mixture with equimolar composition under dry conditions increased from 8.8 to 16.9, and for the equimolar CO2/CH4 mixture, the value increased from 105.9 to 176. The W-SSZ-13 membranes also showed better separation performance under wet conditions. For both systems, the W-SSZ-13 membrane showed higher &#945;max and less CO2 permeance reductions, indicating a more resistance in wet conditions.</description>

      <title>Sustainable management of fruit waste production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.18559/978-83-8211-209-2/6</link>
      <description>Alfred B&#322;aszczyk, Sylwia Sady, Bogdan Pacho&#322;ek, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392198935

                The main goal of this paper is to review sustainable strategies presented in the literature for managing fruit processing by-products according to the circular economy, which could be useful for companies. In the food processing of fruits, the waste can be utilised directly or indirectly. The direct utilisation of fruit waste does not ensure full valorisation and does not fully minimise the environmental impact. The most sustainable management for the full valorisation of fruit waste according to the circular economy is the indirect utilisation, which requires an energyintensive drying process before the biorefinery approach. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.3 promotes the reduction of food waste and food loss throughout the supply chain to achieve sustainable development by 2030, especially at retail and consumption levels. The fruit processing industry produces large amounts of by-products, mainly removed by landfilling or incineration. However, these methods cause emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia, and release dioxin into the environment. In addition, it causes a loss of valuable biomass and nutrients and an economic loss. The sustainable management of fruit processing by-products is important to reduce the amount of food waste deposited in landfills and to develop strategies through their reuse for full valorisation and added economic value. The currently proposed biorefinery only focuses on partial valorisation of fruit waste, which is not completely compatible with the closedloop economy framework and economically feasible due to the low-efficiency bioprocesses. Therefore, there is a need for sustainable conception in the biorefinery approach, which can provide full valorisation of fruit waste according to the circular economy.</description>

                Green ammonia (NH3), made by using renewable electricity to split nearly limitless nitrogen (N2) molecules, is a vital platform molecule and an ideal fuel to drive the sustainable development of human society without carbon dioxide emission. The NH3 electrosynthesis field currently faces the dilemma of low yield rate and efficiency; however, decoupling the overlapping issues of this area and providing guidelines for its development directions are not trivial because it involves complex reaction process and multidisciplinary entries (for example, electrochemistry, catalysis, interfaces, processes, etc.). In this Perspective, we introduce a classification scheme for NH3 electrosynthesis based on the reaction process, namely, direct (N2 reduction reaction) and indirect electrosynthesis (Li-mediated/plasma-enabled NH3 electrosynthesis). This categorization allows us to finely decouple the complicated reaction pathways and identify the specific rate-determining steps/bottleneck issues for each synthesis approach such as N2 activation, H2 evolution side reaction, solid-electrolyte interphase engineering, plasma process, etc. We then present a detailed overview of the latest progresses on solving these core issues in terms of the whole electrochemical system covering the electrocatalysts, electrodes, electrolytes, electrolyzers, etc. Finally, we discuss the research focuses and the promising strategies for the development of NH3 electrosynthesis in the future with a multiscale perspective of atomistic mechanisms, nanoscale electrocatalysts, microscale electrodes/interfaces, and macroscale electrolyzers/processes. It is expected that this Perspective will provide the readers with an in-depth understanding of the bottleneck issues and insightful guidance on designing the efficient NH3 electrosynthesis systems.</description>

      <title>The study of strong metal-support interaction enhanced PdZn alloy nanocatalysts for methanol steam reforming</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jallcom.2024.174006</link>

                Methanol steam reforming faces a significant challenge due to CO formation, which can lead to poisoning of fuel cell electrodes. This study introduces a series of Pd/ZnO catalysts prepared by ethylene glycol reduction, exhibiting remarkable selectivity in methanol steam reforming (MSR). The majority of palladium species exist in the form of PdZn alloy, attributed to the dual reduction process. This process, along with the generation of zinc vacancies and oxygen vacancies, enhances the interaction between the metal-carrier, promoting the formation of PdZn alloy, significantly improving CO2 selectivity and catalytic activity. Even at a high temperature of 400 &#176;C, the active phase remains stable. After 5 hours of MSR, the 3% Pd/ZnO-300H2 catalyst achieves a hydrogen production rate of 1628.0 mmol&#183;gcat-1&#183;h-1, with methanol conversion stabilized at 94%, CO2 selectivity reaching 97.7%, and CO content as low as 0.5%. These results outperform recent studies on hydrogen production. Furthermore, DFT calculations elucidate the complete reaction pathway (111) on PdZn. This study provides initial insights into the influence of metal-carrier interaction on the formation of PdZn alloy, suggesting a new direction for palladium-based catalysts in methanol steam reforming.</description>

                Single iron atoms supported on nitrogen-doped graphene (Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C) have shown promise in catalyzing electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO with low overpotential and high selectivity. However, the nature of its rate-limiting step and the effect of active-site environment on catalytic activity are still under debate. Previous theoretical studies exclusively rely on density functional theory (DFT), but their predictions are limited by inherent errors in DFT functionals, leading to diverging conclusions on catalytic mechanisms. Herein, we employ an efficient quantum embedding strategy to enable high-level coupled-cluster (CCSD(T)) simulations of the thermodynamics of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C-catalyzed CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and its competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Our calculations accurately predict experimental CO binding energy, onset potential, and potential of maximal Faradaic efficiency (FE) with FeN4 as the catalytic active site. We find that the thermodynamic-limiting step is the formation of a *COOH intermediate at low overpotential, which becomes CO2 adsorption and CO desorption at higher overpotential. Our simulation reveals that the potential-dependent high selectivity of FeN4 originates from the higher charge capacity of *COOH compared to *H. Furthermore, our calculations elucidate distinct roles of active-site environments, including vacancy defect and nitrogen doping. Particularly, graphitic nitrogen doping simultaneously lowers the CO2RR onset potential and allows a wider potential range for high CO FE. This work highlights the importance of robust many-body quantum chemical simulations in achieving quantitative understanding of multistep electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms.</description>
