                Renewable electricity shows immense potential as a driving force for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) in production of formate (HCOO&#8208;) at industrial current density, providing a promising path for value&#8208;added chemicals and chemical manufacturing. However, achieving high selectivity and stable production of HCOO&#8208; at industrial current density remains a challenge. Here, we present a robust Bi0.6Cu0.4 NSs catalyst capable of regenerating necessary catalytic core (Bi&#8208;O) through cyclic voltammetry (CV) treatment. Notably, at 260 mA cm&#8208;2, faradaic efficiency of HCOO&#8208; reaches an exceptional selectivity to 99.23%, maintaining above 90% even after 400h, which is longest reaction time reported at industrial current density. Furthermore, in stability test, the catalyst was constructed by CV reconstruction to achieve stable and efficient production of HCOO&#8208;. In 20h reaction test, the catalyst has a rate of HCOO&#8208; production of 13.24mmol m&#8208;2 s&#8208;1, a HCOO&#8208; concentration of 1.91mol L&#8208;1, and an energy consumption of 129.80kWh kmol&#8208;1. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy reveals the formation of Bi&#8208;O structure during the gradual transformation of catalyst from Bi0.6Cu0.4 NBs to Bi0.6Cu0.4 NSs. Theoretical studies highlight the pivotal role of Bi&#8208;O structure in modifying the adsorption behavior of reaction intermediates, which further reduces energy barrier for *OCHO conversion in CO2RR.</description>

      <title>A synergetic cocatalyst for conversion of carbon dioxide, sunlight, and water into methanol</title>

                The conversion of CO 2 into liquid fuels, using only sunlight and water, offers a promising path to carbon neutrality. An outstanding challenge is to achieve high efficiency and product selectivity. Here, we introduce a wireless photocatalytic architecture for conversion of CO 2 and water into methanol and oxygen. The catalytic material consists of semiconducting nanowires decorated with core&#8211;shell nanoparticles, with a copper-rhodium core and a chromium oxide shell. The Rh/CrOOH interface provides a unidirectional channel for proton reduction, enabling hydrogen spillover at the core&#8211;shell interface. The vectorial transfer of protons, electrons, and hydrogen atoms allows for switching the mechanism of CO 2 reduction from a proton-coupled electron transfer pathway in aqueous solution to hydrogenation of CO 2 with a solar-to-methanol efficiency of 0.22%. The reported findings demonstrate a highly efficient, stable, and scalable wireless system for synthesis of methanol from CO 2 that could provide a viable path toward carbon neutrality and environmental sustainability.</description>

      <title>Photocatalytic Synergy between &#945;&#8208;Bi2O3 Nanosphere and Spindle MIL&#8208;88A for Gas&#8208;Phase CO2 Reduction</title>

                Visible light&#8208;active photocatalysts play a crucial role in gas&#8208;phase photocatalytic CO2 reduction, offering significant potential for sustainable energy conversion. Herein, we present the synthesis of spindle&#8208;shaped Iron (Fe)&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) MIL&#8208;88A, coupled with distinct &#945;&#8208;Bi2O3 nanospheres. The &#945;&#8208;Bi2O3/MIL88A heterostructure is formed by interacting opposite surface charges, enhancing visible&#8208;light absorption and efficient interfacial charge&#8208;carrier separation. Such low&#8208;cost photocatalysts have a 1.75 eV band gap and demonstrate enhanced efficacy in converting CO2 to CO, CH4, and H2 in water without using any sacrificial agents or noble metals compared to pristine MIL88A. In addition, in situ Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) analyses revealed that these unique catalysts combination promoted enhanced interfacial charge dynamics, creating efficient trapping sites for photogenerated carriers. Further, in&#8208;situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transfer Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) investigation elucidates the plausible reaction mechanism and provides an effective methodology for catalyst screening for CO2 photoreduction. This study offers an effective approach for synthesizing the earth&#8208;abundant heterostructure from metal oxide and low&#8208;cost MOFs, enhancing photocatalytic activity for sustainable carbon dioxide conversion into invaluable chemicals.</description>

      <title>Health equity and synergistic abatement strategies of carbon dioxide and air pollutant emissions reduction in China's eastern coastal area</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad715b</link>

                Abstract Quantifying regional health disparities linked to air pollution is essential for enhancing air quality and attaining carbon neutrality objectives. Nonetheless, the efficacy of proactive policies in ensuring equitable health protection in China's Eastern Coastal Area (ECA) remains uncertain. Here, we employed an integrated assessment model to assess the combined reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) and atmospheric pollutants and their health repercussions in the ECA of China. Our findings reveal that 273,000 premature deaths are attributable to air pollution in 2060 in the ECA in the absence of mitigation policies. Conversely, carbon reduction policies are poised to curtail 80% of CO2 emissions, alongside reductions of 76% for NOx, 79% for SO2, 80% for PM2.5, 72% for VOCs, and 66% for NH3 emissions. Air pollution control policies could mitigate premature deaths by 19,600, while carbon reduction policies could potentially lower them by 50,800. The health inequality coefficient among provinces stands at 0.19, primarily attributable to significantly higher mortality rates in Hebei and Shandong. These findings yield valuable insights for crafting synergistic abatement strategies in similarly imbalanced developmental regions grappling with comparable environmental challenges.</description>

      <title>Insights into Bimetallic Ag2Cu2O3 Precatalyst for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Ethanol</title>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) into valuable chemicals represents an effective approach for realizing carbon neutralization goals. Copper oxide&#8208;derived catalysts are particularly promising due to their tunable electronic structures. In this study, we focused on investigating the Ag2Cu2O3 model catalyst and a mixture of CuO and Ag2O with an identical metal molar ratio (denoted an M&#8208;CuAgO). Electrochemical CO2RR tests revealed that Ag2Cu2O3 exhibited selectivity towards ethanol, while M&#8208;CuAgO showed no selectivity towards multi&#8208;carbon products. Characterizations of the post&#8208;reaction materials showed differences in the specific crystal structures of the two catalysts. Further X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis demonstrated that the Ag2Cu2O3 structure, after the reaction, facilitated the transfer of electrons from Cu to Ag, thereby promoting the formation of multi&#8208;carbon products. This work underscores the significance of structural design in precatalysts and opens up new avenues for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts.</description>

      <title>From CO2 to solid carbon: reaction mechanism, active species, and conditioning the Ce-alloyed GaInSn catalyst</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-1t2ss</link>

                The electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising realisation of negative emissions to mitigate climate change, aiming at the efficient production and safe longterm storage of carbon-rich sink products. This approach, however, necessitates novel catalyst materials specifically targeting electrochemical carbon dioxide removal. In this work, we investigate synthesis routes for a cerium-incorporated GaInSn-based liquid metal catalyst, focusing on the electrochemical production of graphitic carbon. Preparation and preconditioning of the catalyst are found to be crucial for carbon production, while trace amounts of H2O and OH in the organic electrolyte play a decisive role for the efficiency of the electrocatalytic process. Finally, for a better understanding of the reaction mechanism and the involved active species, experimental findings and density functional theory-based calculations are combined, suggesting a two-step reduction pathway with Ce(OH)x as the catalytically active surface species.</description>

      <title>In Situ Transformation of Hybrid Bismuth Halide into Rhombohedral Bismuth for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202401007</link>
      <description>Bao-Qiang Tian, Juan-Juan Hou, Ting Wang, Yang Gao, Junming Zhang, Wenbo Lu, Jianfeng Jia, ChemCatChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401792471

                Bi&#8208;based electrocatalysts have attracted high attention due to their high selectivity for formate, low cost, and high biocompatibility. Surface modification with halides can adjust the surface charge distribution of metal catalysts, thereby regulating the binding force of the intermediate. Organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid bismuth halides provide an alternative, especially low dimensional structures. Herein, zero&#8208;dimensional hybrid bismuth halides containing Bi4I16 units (denoted as Bi4I16) was recommended as pre&#8208;catalyst due to the Bi&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Bi spacing in Bi4I16 is 4.760 &#197;, nearly equaling to the Bi&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Bi spacing in rhombohedral Bi (4.750 &#197;). The equal spacing may be more beneficial for the electricity&#8208;driven in situ conversion and rearrangement of Bi atoms in the catalytic process. As a contrast, zero&#8208;dimensional bismuth halide containing Bi2I9 units (denoted as Bi2I9) with shorter Bi&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;Bi spacing (4.2415 &#197;) was prepared. The working electrode prepared by Bi4I16 ink was measured for CO2RR, and the partial formate current density can reach 8.2 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.1 V vs RHE. The Bi4I16 catalyst delivers a maximum Faradaic E&#64259;ciency (FE, ~80%) for formate at &#8722;0.86 V vs RHE and maintain a FE higher than 78.5% after 16 h.</description>

      <title>Research on Cu-Site Modification of g-C3N4/CeO2-like Z-Scheme Heterojunction for Enhancing CO2 Reduction and Mechanism Insight</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14080546</link>
      <description>Yiying Zhou, Jinfa Cai, Yuming Sun, Shuhan Jia, Zhonghuan Liu, Xu Tang, Bo Hu, Qian Zhang, Yan Yan, Zhi Zhu, Catalysts. 14(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401807176

                In this work, the successful synthesis of a Cu@g-C3N4/CeO2-like Z-scheme heterojunction through hydrothermal and photo-deposition methods represents high CO2 reduction activity with remarkable CO selectivity, as evidenced by the impressive CO yield of 33.8 &#956;mol/g for Cu@g-C3N4/CeO2, which is over 10 times higher than that of g-C3N4 and CeO2 individually. The characterization and control experimental results indicate that the formation of heterojunctions and the introduction of Cu sites promote charge separation and the transfer of hot electrons, as well as the photothermal effect, which are the essential reasons for the improved CO2 reduction activity. Remarkably, Cu@g-C3N4/CeO2 still exhibits about 92% performance even after multiple cycles. In situ FTIR was utilized to confirm the production of COOH* at 1472 cm&#8722;1 and to elucidate the mechanism behind the high selectivity for CO production. The study&#8217;s investigation into the wide-ranging applicability of the Cu@g-C3N4/CeO2-like Z-scheme heterojunction catalysts is noteworthy, and the exploration of potential reaction mechanisms for CO2 reduction adds valuable insights to the field of catalysis.</description>

      <title>Phytoplankton s CO2 Sinks. Redirecting the Carbon Cycle</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202408.1480.v1</link>
      <description>Basilio Zafrilla, Julia Esclapez, Laura Matarredona, Mar&#305;&#769;a-Jos&#233; Bonete, Guillermo Zafrilla, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401781258

                Since the Industrial Revolution, nearly 700 GtC of carbon have been emitted into the atmosphere as CO2 derived from human activities, of which 292 GtC remain uncontrolled. Furthermore, the emission rate is increasing yearly, with the latest value (2022) of 11 GtC. By the end of this century, the atmospheric CO2 concentration is predicted to surpass 700 ppm. The effects of this sudden carbon release on the worldwide biogeochemical cycles and balances are not yet fully understood, but it is undeniable that global warming and climate change are already a fact, with this gas playing a starring role. Governmental policies and international agreements on emission reduction need to produce results quickly enough, and the deadline to act is running out. Besides the agreements to reduce emissions, alternative strategies to reverse this trend must be sufficiently promoted. Biological CO2 capture is a speedy flow of the carbon cycle capable of capturing over 115 GtC annually through photosynthesis. An increase of 6.5% in this capture and the subsequent stabilization of produced biomass could counteract the current CO2 emission rate. In this overview, the artificial culture of phytoplankton is considered a potential alternative to conducting this large-scale capture. A production system model is suggested and the main technological and political challenges for using large areas as partially-natural photobioreactors are discussed. The global implementation of these large CO2 sinks and the associated infrastructure would stabilize the carbon cycle while it is developed as a new source of richness.</description>

      <title>Economical deployment of quarry minerals for land-based enhanced weathering in Northern California</title>

                Enhanced weathering (EW) is a CO2 removal (CDR) and sequestration strategy that accelerates the natural reactions of minerals that can store carbon from the atmosphere and biotic reactions. One method of EW is to apply finely ground silicate rocks to agricultural lands. EW has been demonstrated in laboratory and field tests, but great uncertainty remains regarding the life-cycle of using locally available rocks on candidate soils. We evaluate the life-cycle impacts, job creation, and cost of scenarios where fines and rocks mined from quarries in Oregon and Northern California are transported by truck and tilled into agricultural soils. Candidate quarry dust samples were classified as dacite, andesite, and olivine-bearing rocks, with EW potentials ranging from 125-760 kg CO2/metric tonne rock. We determined the olivine-bearing rock from Southern Oregon could achieve a levelized cost of CDR under the DOE Earthshot target of $100/t CO2, as long as application rates are 25 t/ha or more. Even andesite and dacite materials reach lower costs than commercial direct air capture technologies, with reduction in fines purchase and transport costs critical for achieving the Earthshot target. The results suggest that low-cost EW can be achieved using natural quarry materials, with average removal up to 2.2 t CO2e per hectare per year.</description>

                Abstract Carbon storage in soils is important in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). However, the sensitivity of the soil-carbon turnover time (&#964;soil) to temperature and hydrology forcing is still not fully understood. Here, we use radiocarbon dating of plant-derived lipids in conjunction with reconstructions of temperature and rainfall from an eastern Mediterranean sediment core receiving terrigenous material from the Nile-River watershed to investigate &#964;soil in subtropical and tropical areas during the last 18,000 years. We find that the &#964;soil was reduced by an order of magnitude over the last deglaciation and infer that this reduction was caused from amplified soil respiration rates. Our data indicate that the deglacial warming was the major driver of these changes while the impact of hydroclimate was relatively small. We conclude that increased CO2 efflux from soils into the atmosphere constituted a positive feedback to global warming. However, simulated glacial-to-interglacial changes in a dynamic global vegetation model underestimate our data-based reconstructions of soil-carbon turnover times suggesting that this climate feedback might be underestimated.</description>

                Plant responses to changing environments afford complex regulation at transcriptome and proteome level to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Homeostasis itself constitutes a complex and dynamic equilibrium of metabolic reactions and transport processes among cellular compartments. In the present study, we aimed at the highest possible resolution of this network by combining analysis of transcriptome, proteome and subcellular resolved metabolome of plants exposed to rising carbon dioxide concentrations over a time course of one week. To prove suitability of our approach, we included mutants affected in photorespiratory metabolism and, thus, should deviate from the wildtype in their response to elevated CO2. Our multi-omics analysis revealed that the hpr1-1 mutant, defective in peroxisomal hydroxypyruvate reduction, is also affected in cytosolic pyruvate metabolism, reaching out to cysteine synthesis, while the hexokinase mutant hxk1 displays a disturbed redox balance upon changing CO2 levels. For the third mutant, defective in the mitochondrial protein BOU, we found compelling evidence that the function of this transporter is related to lipoic acid metabolism, thus challenging current interpretations. This demonstrates that the combined omics approach introduced here opens new insights into complex metabolic interaction of pathways shared among different cellular compartments.</description>

      <title>The impact of the European Union emissions trading system on carbon dioxide emissions: a matrix completion analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-70260-6</link>
      <description>Francesco Biancalani, Giorgio Gnecco, Rodolfo Metulini, Massimo Riccaboni, Scientific Reports. 14(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401850351

                Despite the negative externalities on the environment and human health, today's economies still produce excessive carbon dioxide emissions. As a result, governments are trying to shift production and consumption to more sustainable models that reduce the environmental impact of carbon dioxide emissions. The European Union, in particular, has implemented an innovative policy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by creating a market for emission rights, the emissions trading system. The objective of this paper is to perform a counterfactual analysis to measure the impact of the emissions trading system on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. For this purpose, a recently-developed statistical machine learning method called matrix completion with fixed effects estimation is used and compared to traditional econometric techniques. We apply matrix completion with fixed effects estimation to the prediction of missing counterfactual entries of a carbon dioxide emissions matrix whose elements (indexed row-wise by country and column-wise by year) represent emissions without the emissions trading system for country-year pairs. The results obtained, confirmed by robust diagnostic tests, show a significant effect of the emissions trading system on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions: the majority of European Union countries included in our analysis reduced their total carbon dioxide emissions (associated with selected industries) by about 15.4% during the emissions trading system treatment period 2005&#8211;2020, compared to the total carbon dioxide emissions (associated with the same industries) that would have been achieved in the absence of the emissions trading system policy. Finally, several managerial/practical implications of the study are discussed, together with its possible extensions.</description>

                This study examines the impact of supercritical fluid treatment on 1200V 4H-SiC vertical double diffusion MOSFETs (VD-MOSFETs). When exposed to pure carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide mixed with nitrous oxide, there is a significant increase in the improvement ratio of drain current, which is contingent upon channel mobility but has no effect on threshold voltage. Conversely, the degradation of drain current caused by ammonia gas treatment is attributed to a reduction in channel mobility. Furthermore, the treatment with pure carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide mixed with nitrous oxide effectively passivates shallow defects, while the presence of hydrogen atoms in ammonia gas leads to an increase in shallow defects.</description>

      <description>Gerutu Bosinge Gerutu, Yossapong Laoonual, Journal of Advanced Thermal Science Research. 11(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401872871

                This study compares thermodynamics, economics, and environmental performance of cascaded ORCs operated under a single and dual fluids. In the single fluid cascaded ORC, toluene, benzene, acetone and cyclopentane are run in high and low temperature cycles, whereas in dual fluid cascaded ORC, toluene, benzene, acetone and cyclopentane are run in high temperature cycle and R601a in the low temperature cycle. The analysis compares variations in expander inlet temperature and condensation temperature. Thermodynamic performance involved net power output (Pnet) and thermal efficiency (&#951;th), while economic indicators included net present value (NPV) and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). In environmental performance, the annual reduction in carbon dioxide emission (CO2-eq) is assessed. The findings revealed that dual fluid cascaded ORC generated the highest Pnet of 1245.11 kW while single fluid cascaded ORC reached 1170.27 kW. The dual fluid cascaded ORC showed the significant increase in Pnet (%DPnet) for about 43% at the lowest expander inlet temperature (500 K). In terms of &#951;th, dual fluid cascaded ORC attained 37.23 % while single fluid cascaded ORC reached 33.25%. It is further found that acetone+R601a performed well in dual fluid cascaded ORC, resulting in the highest Pnet and allowing system&#8217;s NPV to turn positive sooner than other fluids. Furthermore, cyclopentane+R601a had the lowest LCOE of 0.0158 US$/kWh, which is 1.1% lower compared to the single fluid cascaded ORC and competitive in the Thai electricity market. In environmental saving, dual fluid cascaded ORC reduced about 144.96 tCO2-eq/year, and outperformed single fluid cascaded ORC by roughly 6.39%.</description>

                Abstract Practical and energy-efficient carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) conversion to value-added and fuel-graded products and transitioning from fossil fuels are promising ways to cope with climate change and to enable the circular economy. The carbon circular economy aims to capture, utilize, and minimize CO 2 emissions as much as possible. To cope with the thermodynamic stability and highly endothermic nature of CO 2 conversion via conventional thermochemical process, the potential application of non-thermal plasma (NTP) with the catalyst, i.e., the hybrid plasma catalysis process to achieve the synergistic effects, in most cases, seems to promise alternatives under non-equilibrium conditions. This review focuses on the NTP fundamentals and comparison with conventional technologies. A critical review has been conducted on the CO 2 reduction with water (H 2 O), methane (CH 4 ) reduction with CO 2 to syngas (CO + H 2 ), CO 2 dissociation to carbon monoxide (CO), CO 2 hydrogenation, CO 2 conversion to organic acids, and one-step CO 2 &#8211;CH 4 reforming to the liquid chemicals. Finally, future challenges are discussed comprehensively, indicating that plasma catalysis has immense investigative areas.</description>

                The ever-increasing expansion of chemical industries produces a variety of common pollutants, including colors, which become a global and environmental problem. Using a nanocatalyst is one of the effective ways to reduce these organic contaminants. With this in mind, a straightforward and effective method for the production of a novel nanocatalyst based on lignin-derived carbon, titanium dioxide nanoparticles, and Ag particles (TiO2/C/Ag) is described. The preparation of carbon and Ag particles (in sub-micro and nano size) was carried out by laser ablation in air. The nanocomposite was synthesized using a facile magnetic stirrer of TiO2, C, and Ag. According to characterization methods, a carbon nanostructure was successfully synthesized through the laser irradiation of lignin. According to scanning electron microscope images, spherical Ag particles were agglomerated over the nanocomposite. The catalytic activities of the TiO2/C/Ag nanocomposite were tested for the decolorization of methylene blue (MB) and Congo red (CR), employing NaBH4 in a water-based solution at 25 &#176;C. After adding fresh NaBH4 to the mixture of nanocomposite and dyes, both UV absorption peaks of MB and CR completely disappeared after 10 s and 4 min, respectively. The catalytic activity of the TiO2/C/Ag nanocomposite was also examined for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) using a NaBH4 reducing agent, suggesting the complete reduction of 4-NP to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) after 2.30 min. This shows excellent catalytic behavior of the prepared nanocomposite in the reduction of organic pollutants.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Mechanism of Converting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into Methanol by the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and Oxygen Vacancy on MgO: Experiments and Density Functional Theory</title>

                Given the great significance of defect and Cu compounds for the reduction of CO2 as well as the few reaction mechanisms of converting CO2 into different hydrocarbons, the effects of oxygen vacancies and Cu2O on the reduction of CO2 were thoroughly investigated, and possible mechanisms were also proposed. A series of Cu2O/Ov-MgO catalysts were synthesized for photothermal catalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol under visible-light irradiation, among which the 7%Cu2O/Ov-MgO composite exhibited the best reduction activity and the yield of methanol was 19.78 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8211;1&#183;h&#8211;1. The successful composite of Cu2O and Ov-MgO can yield a loose and porous nanosheet, uniform distribution, favorable absorbance and photoelectric performance, and increased specific surface area and adsorption ability of CO2, which are all vital to the adsorption and conversion of CO2. The introduction of oxygen vacancy and Cu2O not only promotes the adsorption of CO2 but also provides more electron-triggered CO2 activation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was also performed to reveal the reaction mechanism for effective enhanced CO2 reduction to ethanol or methanol by the comparison of CuO/MgO and Cu2O/Ov-MgO composites, illustrating the reaction pathways of different products. By comparing the key steps in determining the selectivity of C1 or C2, the kinetic barriers of obtaining CH3OH for the Cu2O/Ov-MgO composite with CH3OH as the main product were found to be lower than those of generating CH2*, while the opposite is true for CuO/MgO composites, whereby it may be easier to obtain more C2 products. These insights into the reaction mechanism of converting CO2 into different hydrocarbons are expected to provide guidance for the further design of high-performance photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction catalysts.</description>

      <title>Borohydride Compounds Catalyze the Selective 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; Reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with 9-BBN</title>

                The selective double hydroboration of CO2 into bis(boryl)acetal (BBA) is a challenging yet appealing reduction process since BBA can be used as a versatile C1 and Cn sources for the synthesis of value-added products. In the present study, we demonstrate that simple borohydride compounds are efficient and selective catalysts for the synthesis of BBA when using 9-borabicyclo(3.3.1)nonane (9-BBN) as a reductant. The experimental and theoretical investigations show that while the borohydride species catalyzes the first reduction step of CO2 into formoxyborane (2e&#8211; reduction intermediate), the observed 4e&#8211; reduction selectivity is mostly due to the ability of 9-BBN to reduce the formoxyborane into BBA without a catalyst. Notably, 0.2 mol % of LiH2BBN catalyzed the hydroboration of CO2 with 9-BBN as a reductant into the corresponding BBA in 77% yield with TON and TOF of 385 and 196 h&#8211;1, respectively. The simplicity of borohydride contrasts with the more elaborate catalytic systems used so far for the 4e&#8211; reduction of CO2.</description>

                Abstract Background In-hospital promotion of the oral route and IV to oral switch (IVOST)1 are key antimicrobial stewardship (AS) initiatives providing benefits for patients, staff and the environment, including reduced risk of line infections, medicine costs, nursing workload and plastic waste.1,2 A recent quality improvement (QI) initiative highlighting the environmental sustainability benefits of switching to oral metronidazole (bioavailability &amp;gt;90%) in surgical wards at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH) resulted in a 45% median reduction in IV administrations.3 Objectives To scale and spread this QI initiative to all inpatient wards in NHSGGC Clyde hospitals (RAH, Inverclyde Royal and Vale of Leven) and measure the impact on AS, drug costs, nursing workload and environmental sustainability. Methods A QI scale and spread approach was used including: targeted pharmacist/pharmacy technician prospective audit and feedback; presentations to medical, nursing and pharmacy teams; eye-catching posters on wards/electronic guideline platform; staff champions; and HEPMA IVOST prompts when prescribing or administering IV metronidazole.4 Oral and IV metronidazole usage data was calculated at baseline and for 36 months post-change. Benefits in terms of reduced IV administrations, drug costs and nursing time saved5 were calculated. Plastic waste reduction (giving sets, single use plastic containers, cannula, safety needles, gloves and aprons) associated with switching from IV to oral metronidazole was calculated in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions using a hybrid carbon footprinting methodology and emissions factor databases.6,7 Results There was a 64% median reduction in IV metronidazole defined daily doses (DDDs) (Figure 1) equating to 1977 and 23 724 fewer IV metronidazole administrations monthly and annually, respectively. The equivalent nursing time saved was 659 h per month and 7908 h per year. There was a 26% median shift in percentage IV metronidazole of total (IV plus oral) use (Figure 2). There was a 38% median reduction in metronidazole drug cost (Figure 3). The carbon footprint saving achieved from switching from IV to oral metronidazole was calculated as 1.48111 kg CO2e per dose, equating to 2928 kg CO2e per month and an annual carbon footprint saving of 35.1 tonnes CO2e; refer to Table 1 for equivalents. Conclusions A QI scale and spread approach to raise awareness of the multidisciplinary team to the benefits of appropriate switch from IV to oral metronidazole resulted in a change in prescribing behaviour and a significant reduction in IV administrations. This is important in terms of improved AS, patient safety, workforce cost and efficiency and environmental sustainability.</description>

                Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction serves as an effective strategy to tackle energy crises and mitigate greenhouse gas effects. The development of efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts has been a research hotspot in the field. In this study, we designed four Co-doped single-atom catalysts (Co&#8211;N&#967;@C) using carbon nanotubes as carriers, these catalysts included tri- and dicoordinated N-doped carbon nanoribbons, as well as tri- and dicoordinated N-doped graphene, respectively denoted as H3(H2)-Co/CNT and 3(2)-Co/CNT. The stable configurations of these Co&#8211;N&#967;@C catalysts were optimized using the PBE+D3 method. Additionally, we explored the reaction mechanisms of these catalysts for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into four C1 products, including CO, HCOOH, CH3OH and CH4, in detail. Upon comparing the limiting potentials (UL) across the Co&#8211;N&#967;@C catalysts, the activity sequence for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 was H2&#8211;Co/CNT &gt; 3-Co/CNT &gt; H3&#8211;Co/CNT &gt; 2-Co/CNT. Meanwhile, our investigation of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with four catalysts elucidated the influence of acidic conditions on the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction process. Specifically, controlling the acidity of the solution was crucial when using the H3&#8211;Co/CNT and H2&#8211;Co/CNT catalysts, while the 3-Co/CNT and 2-Co/CNT catalysts were almost unaffected by the solution's acidity. We hope that our research will provide a theoretical foundation for designing more effective CO2 reduction electrocatalysts.</description>

                Reduction of the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is a worldwide problem that needs to be solved urgently. Storing CO2 as CO2 hydrate in subsurface reservoirs in cold regions can be an effective way to reduce atmospheric CO2 content. In this study, we utilize the geological data for three cold regions in Northeast and Northwest China to analyze the probable thickness, area, and porosity of the CO2 hydrate stability zone. Out of 12 cold locations, eight are located in the Qinghai&#8211;Tibetan Plateau (QTP), three in Northwest China (NW), and one in Mohe Basin (MB). Using conservative estimates of the effective thickness, area, and porosity, we calculate the reservoir volume of the CO2 hydrate stability zones for each location. The results show that the 12 cold locations have a total CO2 storage capacity of 2052 Gt. Of this, QTP has the highest CO2 storage capacity of 518 Gt.</description>

                Rutile-type Co0.5Ti0.5NbO4 (CTO)-based materials doped with Fe3+ or Ni2+ were investigated as cathode electrodes to modify their electrical conductivity and electrocatalysis toward CO2 splitting. Higher electric conductivity was found in Co0.4Fe0.2Ti0.4NbO4 (CTO-Fe, 0.78 S cm&#8211;1) and Co0.25Ni0.25Ti0.5NbO4 (CTO-Ni, 2.10 S cm&#8211;1) compared to CTO (0.49 S cm&#8211;1) after the reduction at 800 &#176;C in Ar-5% H2. Co and Co&#8211;Ni particles exsolved in situ from the surface of CTO, CTO-Fe, and CTO-Ni after reduction. CTO-Ni and CTO-Fe cathodes did better in the CO2 electrolysis at 800 &#176;C than the CTO one, but the CTO-Ni cell was unstable after 10 h of operation due to the carbon deposition that blocked the electrode. The cell with CTO-Fe demonstrated a good stability for CO2 splitting in 100 h. This work demonstrates that rutile-type CTO-based cathodes are promising to provide an efficient and candidate oxide cathode for the electrolysis of CO2.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of the Tribology of Diamond-Like Carbon Films in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Fracturing Fluid Environments</title>

                Surface wear of fracturing pump plungers seriously diminishes the efficiency of oil and gas production, while diamond-like carbon (DLC) film is considered to be a promising material for reducing friction and wear of oil and gas equipment due to its excellent comprehensive properties. However, the lubricating performance of DLC films is influenced by various factors, and the impact of CO2 content on their microscopic tribological behavior and mechanism under CO2 fracturing environment remains unexplored. This study employs reactive molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the tribological properties of two distinct systems under different CO2 contents in fracturing fluid environments. The results indicate that the reduction of average friction force primarily relies on the increase of CO2 content, and the increase in CO2 content enhances the mobility of medium molecules while also retarding the transformation of atomic lattice and the consumption of medium molecules. Although DLC film is encapsulated by atomic transfer layers at the later stages of sliding, atomic passivation still contributes to the reduction of friction force. Nevertheless, the application of DLC film directly and effectively diminishes the transformation of atomic lattice and shear strain, thereby reducing wear and deformation of the friction pairs. Concurrently, it significantly lowers the average temperature of the system. The findings suggest that enhancing CO2 content on the basis of applying DLC films significantly contributes to extending the service life of plungers.</description>

                Abstract The increase of global carbon dioxide concentration leads to climate change and accurate estimation of carbon sink fluxes from rock weathering in karst regions is of great significance to the current global carbon cycle and climate change. However, sulfide oxidation in coal-bearing strata in karst areas of northern China forms sulfuric acid that enters the karst groundwater system and participates in the dissolution of carbonate rocks, making carbon sink estimates potentially too high. To accurately estimate carbon sinks, we selected a typical foothill karst system in northern China. The effects of sulfuric acid on carbonate weathering and carbon sink flux were quantitatively evaluated by applying the Galy model and water chemistry methods. Twenty-nine data sets were analyzed for the dry and wet seasons. The results show that the karst groundwater ions in the spring area mainly originated from the weathering and dissolution of carbonate rocks and partly from the weathering and dissolution of silicate rocks. The total HCO3- flux in the spring area is 296.49&#180;103mol/km2&#183;a-1. When only carbonic acid dissolution was considered, the rock dissolution rate was 300.83&#180;103mol/km2&#183;a-1 and the total consumed CO2 flux was 191.82&#180;103mol/km2&#183;a-1. When carbonic acid and sulfuric acid were jointly involved, the rock dissolution rate was 364.33&#180;103mol/km2&#183;a-1 and the total consumed CO2 flux was 162.17&#180;103mol/km2&#183;a-1. With the participation of sulfuric acid, the rock dissolution rate was elevated by 21.11%, while the consumed CO2 flux decreased by 15%, and the sink reduction effect of sulfuric acid dissolution on karst carbon sinks was obvious. And the carbon sink rate in wet season more than doubled compared with that in dry season. This study provides a basis for the evaluation of carbon sinks in northern China.</description>

      <title>Rational H2 Partial Pressure over Nickel/Ceria Crystal Enables Efficient and Durable Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Zone Air&#8208;Level CO2 Methanation</title>

                On the way to carbon neutrality, directly catalyzing atmospheric CO2 into high&#8208;value chemicals might be an effective approach to mitigate the negative impacts of rising airborne CO2 concentrations. Here, we pioneer the investigation of the influence of the H2/CO2 partial pressure ratio (PPR) on air&#8208;level CO2 methanation. Using Ni/CeO2 as a case catalyst, increasing H2/CO2 PPR significantly improves low&#8208;temperature CO2 conversion and high&#8208;temperature CH4 selectivity, i.e., from 10 of H2/CO2 PPR on, CO2 is completely methanized at 250 &#176;C, and nearly 100% CH4 selectivity is achieved at 400 &#176;C. 100&#8208;hour stability tests demonstrate the practical application potential of Ni/CeO2 at 250 &#176;C and 400 &#176;C. In&#8208;situ DRIFTS reveal that reinforced formate pathway by increasing H2/CO2 PPR is responsible for the high CH4 yield. In contrast, even though the CO pathway dominated CO2 conversion on Ni is enhanced by rising H2/CO2 PPR, but at a high reaction temperature, the promoted CO desorption still leads to lower CH4 selectivity. This work offers deep insights into the direct air&#8208;level CO2 resourceization, contributing to the achievement of airborne CO2 reductions.</description>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) is a meaningful way for CO2 depletion and value addition. And electrocatalysts play great roles in the CO2 reduction product selectivity. SnOx-based catalysts have been widely used in formate production. However, the activity and selectivity are still unsatisfying, especially at the industrial level current density (&gt;0.2 A cm&#8211;2) for pure HCOOH production. In this work, we proposed a triple-metal composite electrocatalyst with high oxygen vacancy contents and an abundant grain-boundary strategy for the eCO2RR. In particular, oxygen vacancies in the designed catalyst reached 13.9%. When catalysts were employed as catalysts for eCO2RR, both high HCOOH FE and long-term electrolysis stability under acid electrolytes were obtained. The FE of HCOOH was around 87.9% at 0.3 A cm&#8211;2 and was stable even after 15,000 s of electrolysis. This work provides a new path for electrocatalyst design and highly efficient HCOOH production.</description>

                Abstract Atomic Fe sites enabled electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction (ECO 2 R) to carbon monoxide (CO) at low overpotentials. However, the narrow potential ranges for selective CO 2 conversion on atomic Fe sites hindered the CO production at high current densities. Therefore, unveiling the CO 2 electroreduction processes and clarifying the catalytic mechanisms on different atomic Fe sites are important for better design of atomic Fe catalysts toward efficient ECO 2 R. Herein, the ECO 2 R processes on single&#8208;atom, dual&#8208;atom, and cluster Fe sites are systematically investigated, and clarify that the balanced water dissociation and CO 2 protonation on dual&#8208;atom Fe sites promote the efficient CO production. The dual&#8208;atom Fe catalyst achieves Faradaic efficiencies of CO ( FE CO ) above 92% over a wide potential range of &#8722;0.4&#8211;&#8722;0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode and maintains FE CO of 91% after 153&#8208;h electrolysis in H&#8208;type cell. Benefitting from the favorable CO 2 protonation for ECO 2 R on dual&#8208;atom Fe sites, pH&#8208;universal CO 2 electroreduction is achieved in alkali&#8208;/acid&#8208;/bicarbonate&#8208;fed membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, with FE CO exceeds 98% in strongly acidic/alkaline and neutral mediums. The work reveals a water dissociation&#8208;promoted CO 2 electroreduction on dual&#8208;atom Fe sites and presents a feasible regulation of atomic Fe sites for highly active/selective ECO 2 R.</description>

      <title>Chemical-Assisted CO2 Water-Alternating-Gas Injection for Enhanced Sweep Efficiency in CO2-EOR</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29163978</link>
      <description>Pengwei Fang, Qun Zhang, Chunxia Zhou, Zhengming Yang, Hongwei Yu, Meng Du, Xinliang Chen, Yuxuan Song, Sicai Wang, Yuan Gao, Zhuoying Dou, Meiwen Cao, Molecules. 29(16)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401759048

                CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) is a crucial method for CO2 utilization and sequestration, representing an important zero-carbon or even negative-carbon emission reduction technology. However, the low viscosity of CO2 and reservoir heterogeneity often result in early gas breakthrough, significantly reducing CO2 utilization and sequestration efficiency. A water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection is a technique for mitigating gas breakthrough and viscous fingering in CO2-EOR. However, it encounters challenges related to insufficient mobility control in highly heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs, resulting in gas channeling and low sweep efficiency. Despite the extensive application and research of a WAG injection in oil and gas reservoirs, the most recent comprehensive review dates back to 2018, which focuses on the mechanisms of EOR using conventional WAG. Herein, we give an updated and comprehensive review to incorporate the latest advancements in CO2-WAG flooding techniques for enhanced sweep efficiency, which includes the theory, applications, fluid displacement mechanisms, and control strategies of a CO2-WAG injection. It addresses common challenges, operational issues, and remedial measures in WAG projects by covering studies from experiments, simulations, and pore-scale modeling. This review aims to provide guidance and serve as a reference for the application and research advancement of CO2-EOR techniques in heterogeneous and fractured reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Dynamic Change and Driving Force of Vegetation Carbon Sink in Taihang Mountain, China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/land13091348</link>

                Vegetation plays an important role in absorbing carbon dioxide and accelerating the achievement of carbon neutrality. As the ecological barrier of North China, the Taihang Mountains are pivotal to the ecological construction project of China. Nevertheless, the dynamic development of the vegetation carbon sink in the region and the impact factors on the sink have not been systematically evaluated. This study employed a comprehensive approach, utilising remote sensing technology and meteorological and topographic data, in conjunction with the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) estimation model to reveal the characteristics of vegetation carbon sinks in the Taihang Mountain, and then revealed the dynamics evolution of the NEP and the inter-annual trend by using Theil&#8211;Sen Median slope estimation, the Mann&#8211;Kendall test, and the coefficient of dissociation and analysed the driving roles of the influencing factors by using the parameter optimal geographic detector. Our findings suggest that the NEP in the Taihang Mountain area has a clear growth trend in time, the average value of NEP in the Taihang Mountain area is 289 gC-m&#8722;2-a&#8722;1 from 2000 to 2022, and the spatial distribution shows the characteristics of high in the northeast and low in the middle and west, with a gradual increase from the northeast to the southwest; the areas with high fluctuation of NEP are mainly distributed in the areas around some cities that are susceptible to the interference of natural or anthropogenic factors. The vegetation carbon sinks in the Taihang Mountains are influenced by a variety of natural factors, among which the explanatory power of each natural factor is as follows: DEM (0.174) &gt; temperature (0.148) &gt; precipitation (0.026) &gt; slope (0.017) &gt; slope direction (0.003). The natural factor DEM had the strongest explanatory power for NEP changes, and the two-by-two effects of the natural factors on vegetation carbon sinks were all significantly stronger than the effects of a single factor, in which the interaction between DEM and precipitation had the strongest explanatory power; distinguishing from climate change factors, the contribution of anthropogenic activities to NEP changes in more than 90% of the area of the Taihang Mountainous Region was more than 60%, and the driving force of anthropogenic factors on NEP changes in the Taihang Mountainous Region was significantly stronger than that of natural climate change. The contribution of anthropogenic factors to NEP changes in the Taihang Mountains was significantly stronger than that of natural climate change. The results of this study can not only provide a reference for carbon reduction and sink increase and ecological restoration projects in the Taihang Mountains but also benefit the research paradigm of vegetation carbon sequestration in other regions.</description>

      <title>The Freshwater Cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 Does Not Require an Active External Carbonic Anhydrase</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/plants13162323</link>
      <description>Elena V. Kupriyanova, Maria A. Sinetova, David A. Gabrielyan, Dmitry A. Los, Plants. 13(16)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401765935

                Under standard laboratory conditions, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 lacks EcaASyn, a periplasmic carbonic anhydrase (CA). In this study, a S. elongatus transformant was created that expressed the homologous EcaACya from Cyanothece sp. ATCC 51142. This additional external CA had no discernible effect on the adaptive responses and physiology of cells exposed to changes similar to those found in S. elongatus natural habitats, such as fluctuating CO2 and HCO3&#8722; concentrations and ratios, oxidative or light stress, and high CO2. The transformant had a disadvantage over wild-type cells under certain conditions (Na+ depletion, a reduction in CO2). S. elongatus cells lacked their own EcaASyn in all experimental conditions. The results suggest the presence in S. elongatus of mechanisms that limit the appearance of EcaASyn in the periplasm. For the first time, we offer data on the expression pattern of CCM-associated genes during S. elongatus adaptation to CO2 replacement with HCO3&#8722;, as well as cell transfer to high CO2 levels (up to 100%). An increase in CO2 concentration coincides with the suppression of the NDH-14 system, which was previously thought to function constitutively.</description>

                Abstract Catalytic reactions mainly depend on the adsorption properties of reactants on the catalyst, which provides a perspective for the design of reversible lithium&#8722;carbon dioxide (Li&#8722;CO 2 ) batteries including CO 2 reduction (CO 2 RR) and CO 2 evolution (CO 2 ER) reactions. However, due to the complex reaction process, the relationship between the adsorption configuration and CO 2 RR/CO 2 ER catalytic activity is still unclear in Li &#9472; CO 2 batteries. Herein, taking Co 3 S 4 as a model system, nickel (Ni substitution in the tetrahedral site to activate cobalt (Co) atom for forming multiatom catalytic domains in NiCo 2 S 4 is utilized. Benefiting from the special geometric and electronic structures, NiCo 2 S 4 exhibits an optimized adsorption configuration of lithium carbonate (Li 2 CO 3 ), promoting its effective activation and decomposition. As a result, the Li&#8722;CO 2 batteries with NiCo 2 S 4 cathode exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance in terms of low potential gap of 0.42 V and high energy efficiency of 88.7%. This work provides a unique perspective for the development of highly efficient catalysts in Li&#8722;CO 2 batteries.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Gas Accessibility via Macropore Engineering in Amine-Loaded Silica Particles for Enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Adsorption Performance</title>

                The urgent need to mitigate climate change has spurred the development of efficient adsorbents for CO2 capture. Porous solid sorbents, especially those incorporating amine-modified porous silica materials, offer a promising alternative due to their superior selectivity and reversibility. However, the existing research has focused on developing mesoporous silica for CO2 adsorption applications, often overlooking the role of macropores. One critical challenge with mesoporous silica is the restriction in the loading amount of amine due to low pore volume, which is followed by reduction of the CO2 capture capacity due to pore blocking and a decrease in surface area at high amine concentration. Macroporous silica particles offer promising advantages over mesopores in CO2 adsorption performance, including improved mass transfer kinetics and enhanced accessibility of CO2 to amine sites. Therefore, the CO2 adsorption capacity of porous silica materials may not have reached its full potential, and the influence of macropore sizes ranging from 60 to 400 nm has yet to be fully explored. This research, for the first time, aims to address current limitations in CO2 capture methodologies by engineering controllable porous silica particles with various macropore sizes utilizing a spray process followed by tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) modification. Results indicate that increasing TEPA concentration up to 70 wt % enhanced the CO2 adsorption capacity of the particles. The absorption performance was maximized in macroporous silica with a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) template size of 291 nm (6.08 mmol CO2/g of absorbent). Generally, larger macropore size facilitates CO2 diffusion within the particles, preventing the formation of inactive TEPA sites and reducing the CO2 diffusion resistance. This study not only highlights the relationship between the macroporous structure, TEPA modification, and CO2 adsorption capacity but also provides valuable insights for advancing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, emphasizing the potential of macroporous silica to overcome the inherent limitations of its mesoporous counterpart.</description>

      <title>Low Pressure Heliox-based Rebreather System to Reduce Work of Breathing and Conserve Gas</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.12184</link>
      <description>Sairam Parthasarathy, Christopher J. Morton, Respiratory Care. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401908687

                Background: To test the ability of a low-pressure, low-flow, Heliox-based rebreathing system to reduce work of breathing and conserve gas while preserving CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity at physiological levels in a bench study. Methods: We performed a bench study of a novel low-pressure, low-flow, noninvasive Heliox rebreathing system with CO2 scrubber that was connected to an artificial lung simulator with careful monitoring of flow, pressure, work of breathing, oxygen (O2), carbon-dioxide (CO2), temperature, and humidity levels. Multiple runs of breathing were performed while manipulating levels of resistance (5 &#8211; 30 cm H2O/L/sec), gas mixtures (room air, 79% Helium 21% O2, and 70% Helium and 30% O2), and leak levels (ultra-low, low, and high). Results: We found significant reductions in work of breathing (up to 64%) while conserving gas with estimates of up to 54-fold reduction in medical gas wastage (P&lt;0.001). Specifically, at resistances of 5, 10, 20, and 30 cm H2O/L/sec we demonstrated 64%, 57%, 36%, and 7% reduction in work of breathing (P&lt;0.0001). Gas wastage was reduced by 10- to 54-fold while the end-tidal CO2 concentration, humidity, and temperature were maintained by the device at physiological levels. Conclusions: In a bench-test, a low-pressure, low-flow, noninvasive Heliox rebreathing system with CO2 scrubber reduced work of breathing and conserved gas while preserving CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity at physiological levels. Future studies in human subjects need to be performed to determine whether reduction of work of breathing and gas conservation can be achieved.</description>

                Abstract Recovery of natural gas liquid (NGL) from flared gas is considered one of the techniques of emissions reduction, the recovered quantity depends on several factors including the natural gas composition, operating pressure, and temperature. Process simulation is required to measure the recovery of NGL from the flared gas, and process simulation cases are required to predict the NGL productivity, these cases should be generated at several operating conditions for optimization purposes. In this paper, 12873 data sets are generated using Aspen HYSYS for different natural gas compositions collected from 11 natural gas fields. These huge data sets are used to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting the NGL recovery. The developed model was trained based on 70% of the data sets, validated based on 15%, and tested using 15 % of all the data sets. The results show that the developed NN model can accurately the NGL recovery based on the natural gas composition, and the operating pressure and temperature with a coefficient of determination of 0.9999 and an absolute average error of 4%. The proposed model for estimating NGL production rates is a feasible environmental issue. The availability of changing the operating pressure and temperature could help in selecting the proper equipment such as recovery compressors and refrigeration unit size. This approach also could allow production companies to join the project quickly, eliminate carbon dioxide emissions, and start to gain money in a short time.</description>

                Crop production is inherently sensitive to variability in climate. Temperature and CO2 are two important parameters related to climate change, affecting crop yield in a particular region. In this study, an attempt has been made to assess the impact of these two parameters on the productivity of maize crop taking sub tropical region of Jammu as study area. A CERES-Maize model 4.0 was used for this purpose. Three-year weather data (2004-06) is used to simulate the actual yield under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Yield was simulated with elevated temperature (1, 3 and 5oC) and CO2 (440, 550 and 660 ppm) during the growing season. As changes in CO2 concentration and temperature likely to occur concomitantly, so growth and development of maize plant at three temperature regimes (1, 3 and 5oC) under double (660 ppm) CO2 concentration to the baseline (330 ppm) was also assessed. The difference in yield, biomass, grain number and LAI was estimated and analyzed to assess the effect of elevated temperature and CO2. Results revealed that the rise in temperature accelerated plant phenology, reducing dry matter accumulation and crop yield by 5 to 60 per cent. Elevation of CO2 in the level of 440, 550 and 660 ppm showed gradual yield increment of 2.01, 3.92 and 5.37 per cent under rainfed conditions and 2.33, 4.52 and 7.41 per cent under irrigated conditions, respectively. Doubled CO2 increased yield at all the temperature rise situation and completely mitigated the yield and biomass reduction due to temperature rise up to 1oC.</description>

      <title>Selection and Optimization of China&#8217;s Energy Transformation Pathway Under Carbon-Neutral Targets</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12081758</link>
      <description>Yingying Qi, Guohua Yu, Processes. 12(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401761761

                This paper uses a bottom-up national energy technology model to study the optimization of China&#8217;s energy transformation pathway. The model clarifies specific action plans for China&#8217;s energy transformation pathway from 2020 to 2060, total carbon emissions, industry emission reduction responsibilities, and other dimensions. The results show that: (1) The proportion of renewable energy consumption in China&#8217;s entire energy system from 2020 to 2060 will gradually exceed that of fossil energy under ideal circumstances, and the energy system will transition from traditional fossil energy to renewable energy. Meanwhile, the proportion of low-carbon energy sources, such as renewable energy, in primary energy demand will jump from 15.9% in 2020 to over 80% by 2060. (2) China&#8217;s CO2 emissions will be approximately 3 billion tons, 2 billion tons, and 1 billion tons under three different socio-economic development scenarios of low, medium, and high speed in 2060. At that time, China will still need to absorb CO2 through carbon sinks in forests, oceans, and wetlands. (3) The electricity industry has the highest CO2 emissions compared to other industries. The electricity industry must bear significant responsibility for carbon reduction in future energy transformation and economic development.</description>

                Abstract We have developed a bilayer film comprising cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) underlayer and manganese dioxide (MnO2) upper layer, which are active toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), respectively. The bilayer bifunctional catalyst is synthesized by electrodepositing cobalt hydroxide (Co(OH)2) on a porous carbon paper (CP) and subsequently immersing the obtained Co(OH)2/CP in a potassium permanganate (KMnO4) solution without binders or conductive additives. Specifically, electron transfer between the already-deposited Co(OH)2 and MnO4&#8211; proceeded in the solution, yielding MnO2, until all the Co ions become trivalent, after which self-terminates. The proposed method only allows for the construction of the minimum required bifunctional catalyst only at the reaction site of the gas-diffusion electrode, i.e., at the so-called three-phase interface, thus remarkably increasing catalyst utilization while improving reactant and product diffusions. The developed catalyst shows stable MnO2/CoOOH cycles at |20| mA cm&#8211;2 with a minimal difference (0.764 V) between the OER and ORR potentials, reflecting the structural advantage of the proposed catalyst. This work proposes efficient bifunctional catalysts having spatially separated OER/ORR reactive sites that can be synthesized via the simple and scalable electrochemical method, which does not require the skill and optimization of binder and electron-conducting additives.</description>

                Electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 is a promising process to produce renewable chemical feedstocks, such as CO, formic acid, ethylene, and ethanol. To overcome mass transfer limitations imposed by the low solubility of CO2 in the liquid phase, gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) are used to ensure an adequate supply of CO2. The gas&#8211;liquid interface within the GDEs is crucial for achieving high selectivity and stability of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but it is prone to flooding, which can terminate the reactions. Here, we built electrochemical models of silver-based and copper-based GDEs for studying intrinsic factors related to flooding. Our results reveal that there is a narrow "pressure window" for CO2RR, which has a negative correlation with current density. We further define three regions based on the "pressure window": the bubbling zone, the normal working condition zone, and the permeable zone. Our research shows that the bubbling zone offers better selectivity for gaseous products, while the permeable zone favors the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, electrochemical characterization testing investigated the characteristics of each zone and its impact on CO2RR.</description>

                The N&#8208;formylation of amines using CO2 hydrogenation, conducted under additive&#8208;free conditions, represents a crucial methodology in organic synthesis. Herein, we demonstrated a highly efficient ruthenium pincer complex for the selective conversion of a wide array of amines into their corresponding formamides under additive&#8208;free condition with a turnover number (TON) of 980,000 within a single&#8208;batch. Controlled studies suggested the initial reduction of CO2 to carbamate, followed by dehydration to generate formamide. NMR experiments revealed the potential intermediates and indicated the involvement of metal&#8208;ligand cooperativity of catalyst during substrate activation. In addition, this methodology was examined to establish a carbon neutral hydrogen storage cycle by capitalizing on the reversible transformation of formamides.</description>

                The electrochemical reduction of CO2 into value-added chemicals is pivotal for advancing toward carbon neutrality and sustainable energy sources. However, achieving high selectivity for specific products remains challenging due to numerous potential reaction pathways. In this work, we present an innovative copper-sulfur planar structure, Cu-S-BDC, within a metal-organic framework (MOF) catalyst, which demonstrates remarkable selectivity towards formate as the sole carbon product. Notably, it achieves a 59% Faradaic efficiency (FE) for formate at -0.4 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. The reaction mechanism uncovers that the Cu-S catalytic sites within the MOF stabilize the HCOO* intermediate, thereby facilitating selective formate production. Additionally, we elucidate the electronic properties of the MOF, revealing a narrow band gap of 1.203 eV, which enhances the charge transfer within the quasi-2D inorganic building unit structure of the MOF and consequently increases the electrochemical reaction current density. This study highlights the potential of engineering the metal coordination environment within MOFs to enhance both product selectivity and conductivity in electrochemical CO2 reduction.</description>

                Abstract. The rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) would decrease in response to decrease of anthropogenic emissions or cessation (net zero emissions) is of great scientific and societal interest. Such decrease in atmospheric CO2 on the centennial scale would be due essentially entirely to transfer of carbon into the world ocean (WO) and the terrestrial biosphere (TB), which are sink compartments on this time scale. The rate of decrease of excess atmospheric CO2 and the apportionment of this decrease into the two sink compartments has been examined in two prior model intercomparison studies, subsequent either to a pulse emission of CO2 or to abrupt cessation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The present study examines and quantifies inter-model anticorrelation in those studies in the net rate and extent of uptake of CO2 into the two sink compartments. Specifically, in each study the time-dependent coefficients characterizing the net transfer rate into the two sink compartments, (evaluated as the net transfer rate normalized to excess atmospheric CO2 above pre-pulse amount, for the pulse experiment; or as the net transfer rate divided by excess atmospheric CO2 above preindustrial amount, for the abrupt cessation experiment) was found to exhibit strong anticorrelation across the participating models. That is, models for which the normalized rate of uptake into the WO was high exhibited low uptake rate into the TB, and vice versa. This anticorrelation in net transfer rate results in anticorrelation in net uptake extent into the two compartments that is substantially greater than would be expected simply from competition for excess CO2 between the two sink compartments. This anticorrelation, which is manifested in diminished inter-model diversity, can lead to artificially enhanced confidence in current understanding of the consequences of potential future reductions of CO2 emissions and in the global warming potentials of non-CO2 greenhouse gases relative to that of CO2.</description>

                Co-electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and nitrate/nitrite as carbon and nitrogen sources to synthesize urea is an effective strategy to solve the energy problem and alleviate environmental pollution. In this work, combined density functional theory calculations with a constant-potential implicit solvent model, we proposed a strategy for the determination of the preferred reaction pathway and the potential window that is guided by the potential-dependent free energy change. It was found that on the FeNi-N6-C surface, the C&#8211;N coupling occurs between *NHO and the protonated CO2 in the potential window of &#8722;2.43 to &#8722;1.34 V for the urea electrochemical production, where the predicted onset potential accords well with the experimental results. The activity originates from the less weak bonding strength of N&#8211;O and the negatively charged N atom in *NHO. This study offers a general approach to determining the optimal reaction pathway in electrochemistry and insights into the mechanism of electrochemical synthesis of urea.</description>

                One of the main agents responsible for global warming is greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) associated with fuel combustion.Most works in the literature address logistics transportation from an economic perspective, giving little attention to the existing trade-off with sustainability.In this work, we develop two bi-objective mathematical models, one for the inventory routing problem with a heterogeneous fleet and another for the multimodal freight transportation problem, where we minimize costs while simultaneously reducing CO 2 emissions.First, we present an explicit vehicular equation that can statistically estimate CO 2 emissions for different vehicles and types of fuels.Next, we apply two bi-objective methods to the inventory routing problem, the augmented &#949;-constrained and the augmented Tchebycheff metric, to find the efficient Pareto frontier using a branch-and-cut method.For the multimodal freight transportation problems, we consider uncertainty in the origin nodes, apply probabilistic constraints, and also analyze the trade-off of the objective functions using the global criterion method and the augmented Tchebycheff metric.Computational experiments were conducted on instances adapted from the literature and others generated randomly, solving the bi-objective methods exactly.The analysis of the results indicates the approach's ability to balance economy and sustainability, where, on average, extreme solutions show a reduction of more than 50% in emissions and an increase of just over 30% in costs.Finally, the results of the solution methods applied to the two problems considering sustainability are presented and discussed.We detail a methodology for estimating CO 2 emissions, reflecting the complexity and the need to balance economic and ecological factors in logistic problems.</description>

      <title>Promoting Environmental Sustainability: The Role of Renewable Energy Systems and Environmental Taxes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app14167404</link>
      <description>Yugang He, Applied Sciences. 14(16)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401888867

                This study examines the effects of renewable energy consumption and environmental taxes on CO2 emissions in OECD countries from 1990 to 2022, employing the cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) approach. The findings reveal that both renewable energy consumption and environmental taxes significantly reduce CO2 emissions in both the short and the long term, emphasizing their crucial roles in climate change mitigation and sustainability promotion. Furthermore, this study identifies that industrialization and urbanization contribute to increased emissions, whereas foreign direct investment aids in emission reduction through the facilitation of green technology transfer. Economic growth is initially associated with higher emissions, but this trend reverses as economies mature and adopt sustainable practices. These results highlight the importance of continuous investment in renewable energy infrastructure and the implementation of robust environmental tax policies to achieve long-term sustainability goals. The integration of environmental considerations into economic and urban planning, along with leveraging foreign direct investment for technological advancements, is imperative for balancing economic growth with the necessity to reduce carbon emissions and effectively address climate change. This research provides a better understanding of the diverse factors influencing CO2 emissions and offers critical insights for policymakers.</description>

      <title>Scalable Low-Temperature CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electrolysis: Current Status and Outlook</title>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) has brought e-chemical production one step closer to commercialization because of its advantages of minimized ohmic resistance and stackability. However, the current performance of reported eCO2R in MEAs is still far below the threshold for economic feasibility where low overall cell voltage (&lt;2 V) and extensive stability (&gt;5 years) are required. Furthermore, while the production cost of e-chemicals heavily relies on the carbon capture and product separation processes, these areas have received much less attention compared to CO2 electrolysis, itself. In this perspective, we examine the current status of eCO2R technologies from both academic and industrial points of view. We highlight the gap between current capabilities and commercialization standards and offer future research directions for eCO2R technologies with the hope of achieving industrially viable e-chemical production.</description>

      <title>Identification of Patterns in CO2 Emissions among 208 Countries: K-Means Clustering Combined with PCA and Non-Linear t-SNE Visualization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/math12162591</link>
      <description>Ana Lorena Jim&#233;nez Preciado, Salvador Cruz Ak&#233;, Francisco Venegas-Mart&#305;&#769;nez, Mathematics. 12(16)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401794845

                This paper identifies patterns in total and per capita CO2 emissions among 208 countries considering different emission sources, such as cement, flaring, gas, oil, and coal. This research uses linear and non-linear dimensional reduction techniques, combining K-means clustering with principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which allows the identification of distinct emission profiles among nations. This approach allows effective clustering of heterogeneous countries despite the highly dimensional nature of emissions data. The optimal number of clusters is determined using Calinski&#8211;Harabasz and Davies&#8211;Bouldin scores, of five and six clusters for total and per capita CO2 emissions, respectively. The findings reveal that for total emissions, t-SNE brings together the world&#8217;s largest economies and emitters, i.e., China, USA, India, and Russia, into a single cluster, while PCA provides clusters with a single country for China, USA, and Russia. Regarding per capita emissions, PCA generates a cluster with only one country, Qatar, due to its significant flaring emissions, as byproduct of the oil industry, and its low population. This study concludes that international collaboration and coherent global policies are crucial for effectively addressing CO2 emissions and developing targeted climate change mitigation strategies.</description>

                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize the architectural design and energy management of green buildings, offering significant advancements in sustainability and efficiency. This paper explores the transformative impact of AI on improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions in commercial buildings. By leveraging AI algorithms, architects can optimize building performance through advanced environmental analysis, automation of repetitive tasks, and real-time data-driven decision-making. AI facilitates precise energy consumption forecasting and integration of renewable energy sources, enhancing the overall sustainability of buildings. Our study demonstrates that AI can reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions by approximately 8% and 19%, respectively, in typical mid-size office buildings by 2050 compared to conventional methods. Further, the combination of AI with energy efficiency policies and low-emission energy production is projected to yield reductions of up to 40% in energy consumption and 90% in CO2 emissions. This paper provides a systematic approach for quantifying AI's benefits across various building types and climate zones, offering valuable insights for decision-makers in the construction industry.</description>

      <title>The Effectiveness of the EU ETS Policy in Changing the Energy Mix in Selected European Countries</title>

                In the field of economic analysis, the study of the EU ETS policy has primarily focused on the impact of renewable energy consumption on economic growth, as well as the role of legal and fiscal instruments in the development of clean energy. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the EU ETS policy in altering the energy mix of selected European countries, providing both cognitive and applicational value. The evaluation of the effectiveness of this policy focused on the structure of the energy mix and the relationship between rising CO2 emission allowance prices and the decreasing share of coal in the energy mix. The goal was achieved through statistical analysis of secondary sources, primarily sourced from Bloomberg (2016&#8211;2024). The research findings indicated that changes in the structure of energy sources varied across the studied European countries, due to the adopted energy source utilization strategy, resource availability, and geopolitical situations. Additionally, different correlation values were noted between rising CO2 emission allowance prices and the expected reduction in fossil fuel use. Therefore, the EU ETS policy does not fulfill its assigned role&#8212;its implementation contributes to disparities in the economic situations of European economies and creates conditions for unequal competition.</description>

                Tar build-up is one of the bottlenecks of biomass gasification process. Dry reforming of tar is an alternative solution if oxygen chemical potential on the catalyst surface is at sufficient levels. For this purpose, an oxygen donor perovskite, LaCoO3, was used as a catalyst for dry reforming of tar. To circumvent the complexity of the tar and its constituents, benzene molecule was chosen as a model compound. Dry reforming of benzene vapour on the LaCoO3 catalyst was investigated at temperatures of 600, 700, 800 &#176;C, at the CO2/C6H6 ratios of 3, 6, 12 and at space velocities of 14000 and 28000 h-1. The conventional Ni(15 wt.%)/Al2O3 catalyst was also used as a reference material to determine the relative activity of the LaCoO3 catalyst. Different characterization techniques, such as X-Ray Diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, Temperature-programmed reduction, and oxidation were used to determine physicochemical characteristics of catalysts. The findings demonstrate that the LaCoO3 catalyst has a higher CO2 conversion, H2 and CO yields and better stability than the Ni(15 wt.%)/&#947;-Al2O3 catalyst. The improvement in activity is attributed to the strong capacity of LaCoO3 for oxygen exchange. The transfer of lattice oxygen from the surface of the LaCoO3 catalyst facilitates the oxidation of carbon and other surface species and leads to higher conversion and yields.</description>

                Abstract. This manuscript presents the results of a cradle-to-gate lifecycle assessment (LCA) conducted on a component manufactured through two distinct process routes: Hot stamping of AA6082-T6 and cold stamping of AA5251-H22. The primary objective of this study is to provide a detailed understanding of the environmental impact associated with these processes and to conduct a comparative analysis of their environmental profiles. A comprehensive process map was developed for each manufacturing route, delineating all inputs and outputs at each step. Forming trials were executed during the LCA, capturing equipment energy consumption. When immediate data was unavailable from trials, the LCA model was supplemented with information from the Ecoinvent 3.6 database. The analysis demonstrates that the adoption of advanced near-net-shape manufacturing, specifically hot stamping, can significantly diminish the environmental impact compared to traditional cold stamping processes. Despite the additional energy requirements for heating in hot stamping, the overall environmental savings, supported by uncertainty analysis, are considerable. In the case of the examined demonstrator part, hot stamping showcased a noteworthy 35% reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions, equivalent to 6 kg CO2e per part. This reduction is primarily attributed to two key factors: the decreased material thickness achievable in hot stamping while preserving equivalent mechanical characteristics in the final part and the recycling of any material waste after forming. The results underscore the environmental advantages of embracing advanced manufacturing techniques, contributing valuable insights for environmentally conscious decision-making in the manufacturing industry.</description>

      <title>A Study on Management of Administrative Challenges and Market Strategies in the Implementation of Carbon Tax in Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.46799/adv.v2i7.270</link>

                This research discusses administrative challenges and market strategies in implementing a carbon tax in Indonesia. The carbon tax was introduced through the 2021 Harmonization of Tax Regulations Law to control CO2 emissions from fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. Key challenges include administrative complexity, strong inter-agency coordination, effective monitoring systems, and consistent law enforcement. The global carbon market in 2023 shows great potential for economically efficient emissions reductions, but implementing this model requires adapting to Indonesia's socio-economic landscape. The research method used is a qualitative approach with case studies, combining data from policy documents, interviews with tax experts, and local carbon market analysis. The research results show that the implementation of a carbon tax is faced with several major challenges, including a lack of accurate data on emissions, an immature monitoring system, and resistance from certain industrial sectors. Effective market management strategies, such as the allocation of tax revenues to sustainable projects, are key to mitigating negative economic impacts and encouraging investment in green technologies. This research makes a significant contribution to the understanding of the complexity of carbon tax implementation in developing countries and its relevance in the global context for achieving climate change goals.</description>

      <title>Electronic Tunability of Ruthenium Formyl and Hydroxymethyl Intermediates Relevant to Sustainable CO-to-Methanol Conversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.organomet.4c00252</link>

                Metal formyl and hydroxymethyl complexes are implicated as key intermediates in the (photo)electrochemical reduction of carbon oxides (CO2 or CO) to liquid fuels, such as methanol. Formyl complexes, and to a lesser extent hydroxymethyl complexes, have been previously synthesized and characterized; nevertheless, the influence of electronic modifications to ligands supporting these reactive carbon fragments is not well understood. Herein, we report the synthesis of a family of ruthenium polypyridyl carbonyl complexes of the form [Ru(4,4&#8242;-R,R-bpy)(tpy)(CO)]2+ bearing different substituents on the bipyridyl (bpy) ligand (R = OMe, H, CF3). Treatment with NaBH4 as a chemical reductant results in the formation of the formyl and subsequently the hydroxymethyl and methyl complexes; each is characterized by comprehensive NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and isotopic labeling studies. An electron-donating modification (R = OMe) to the bpy ligand is shown to significantly increase the lifetime of the formyl intermediate and the yield of released methanol. We observe a clear linear dependence of thermodynamic parameters on bpy electronics; however, the stability of the formyl complex and the reactivity of the resulting hydroxymethyl complex do not depend linearly on ligand electronics. We anticipate that these results may be extended to future development of (photo)electrocatalytic systems for CO-to-methanol conversion.</description>

                Installations of telecommunications base stations necessary to address the surging demand for new services are traditionally powered by conventional energy sources, which results in massive electricity consumption and CO2 emissions as a portion. In this paper we assess the benefits of adopting renewable energy resources to make telecommunications network greener and cost-efficient, tacking &#8220;3E&#8221; combination-energy security, environmental sustainability, economic development. The study first reviews the seemingly insatiable demand for energy in telecommunications filtering its historical use against the inefficacy and environmental impact of typical fossil power. Followed by the advantages renewable energy offers in terms of lower GHG emissions, cost reduction and increased reliability / resilience. The possibility of powering BTSs by using renewable power sources such as solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, and hybrid systems is also considered. Case studies show some real-world projects and their success stories to highlight the benefits as well as draw out here best practices in implementation for those inclined. The paper also presents some future and novel trends that could improve the sustainability, efficiency of telecommunication infrastructure. This review provides an overview of the renewable energy assessment in LTE systems and underlines its importance to drive telecom sector transformation, developing sustainability strategies, and alleviating global energy scarcity issues. &#8203;</description>

      <title>Intraphase Switching of Hollow CoCuFe Nanocubes for Efficient Electrochemical Nitrite Reduction to Ammonia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c09663</link>

                This study addresses the urgent need to focus on the nitrite reduction reaction (NO2&#8211;RR) to ammonia (NH3). A ternary-metal Prussian blue analogue (CoCuFe-PBA) was utilized as the template material, leveraging its tunable electronic properties to synthesize CoCuFe oxide (CoCuFe-O) through controlled calcination. Subsequently, a CoCuFe alloy (CoCuFe-A) was obtained via pulsed laser irradiation in liquids. The electrochemical properties of CoCuFe-O, derived from the PBA crystal structure, demonstrated a high yield of NH4+ at a rate of 555.84 &#956;mol h&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2, with the highest Faradaic efficiency of 91.8% and a selectivity of 97.3% during a 1-h NO2&#8211;RR under an optimized potential of &#8722;1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. In situ Raman spectroscopy revealed the collaborative role of redox pairs (Co3+/Co2+ and Fe3+/Fe2+) as proton (H+) suppliers, with Cu centers serving as NO2&#8211; binders, thereby enhancing the reaction rate. Additionally, theoretical studies confirmed that Fe and Co atoms are more reactive than Cu toward intermediates playing crucial roles in hydrogenation, while Cu primarily activates NO owing to hydrogenation by the Fe and Co atoms and a high kinetic barrier in H2O* adsorption. This comprehensive investigation provides valuable insights into the electrochemical NO2&#8211;RR, establishing a foundation for efficient and sustainable NH3 synthesis strategies.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Properties of Green SCC with and without Novel Additive</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.55041/ijsrem37187</link>
      <description>IJSREM Journal, INTERANTIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT. 08(008)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401893700

                Concrete is the most widely used construction material in civil engineering industry because of its proved structural strength and stability when made properly. The concrete industry is constantly trying to evolve to make concrete more sustainable replacing a part of full cement with additives and Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs). Each tonne of cement production releases one tonne of CO2 into the atmosphere and hence to greenhouse effect and global warming. A cost effective, alternative and innovative materials called novel additive is taken up for present study to reduce the cement consumption per m3 of concrete/SCC without reduction in strength of required grade. In this project an effort is made replacing cement content of SCC partially with Fly Ash, Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) in combination of novel additive. The study focused at studying the properties of fresh SCC and hardened SCC. The design mix proportion of 1: 2.63: 1.86 with a W/B ratio of 0.36 is taken up and 4 different mixes with different combinations of varied percentage replacement materials with 2% by weight of cement of novel additive. The properties of green SCC showed that fresh properties get enhanced through usage of mineral admixtures including a novel additive and hence, the addition of mineral admixture improve the flowability or rheology of SCC mixes. The strength of SCC achieved is ranging from 32- 46 N/mm2 for a cementitious content of 400 kg/m3 , highest being with lowest cement content with novel additive.

      <title>Disentangling the dust and gas contributions of the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz28</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202450891</link>
      <description>T. Kaeufer, P. Woitke, I. Kamp, J. S. Kanwar, M. Min, Astronomy and Astrophysics. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401747978

                Recent spectra of protoplanetary disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS), captured by the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), reveal a rich carbon chemistry. Current interpretations of these spectra are based on 0D slab models and provide valuable estimates for molecular emission temperatures and column densities in the innermost disk ($ radius au$). However, the established fitting procedures and simplified models are challenged by the many overlapping gas features. We aim to simultaneously determine the molecular and the dust composition of the disk around the VLMS Sz\,28 in a Bayesian way. We modelled the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz\,28 up to $17\ m$ using the Dust Continuum Kit with Line emission from Gas (DuCKLinG). Systematically excluding different molecules from the Bayesian analysis allowed for an evidence determination of all investigated molecules and isotopologues. We continued by examining the emission conditions and locations of all molecules, analysing the differences to previous 0D slab fitting, and analysing the dust composition. We find very strong Bayesian evidence for the presence of C2H2 HCN C6H6 CO2 HC3N C2H6 C3H4 C4H2 and CH4 in the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz\,28. Additionally, we identify CH3 and find tentative indications for NH3 . There is no evidence for water in the spectrum. However, we show that column densities of up to $2 $ could be hidden in the observational noise if assuming similar emission conditions of water as the detected hydrocarbons. Contrary to previous 0D slab results, a C4H2 quasi-continuum is robustly identified. We confirm previous conclusions that the dust in Sz\,28 is highly evolved, with large grains ($5\ m$) and a high crystallinity fraction being retrieved. We expect some of the stated differences to previous 0D slab fitting results to arise from an updated data reduction of the spectrum, but also due to the different modelling process. The latter reason underpins the need for more advanced models and fitting procedures.</description>

      <title>Decision Support System for Sustainable Retrofitting of Existing Commercial Office Buildings</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.18535/ijsrm/v12i08.em20</link>
      <description>Calistus Bengold Anarene, Swapan Saha, Peter J. Davies, Dr MD Kamrul, International Journal of Scientific Research and Management (IJSRM). 12(08)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401828729

                With more than 60% of the inventory being over thirty years old, commercial office buildings represent a substantial global energy consumer. The Australian government has attempted to lower greenhouse gas emissions through legislation, but the implementation of these efforts has only resulted in annual reductions of 1-3%. It is essential to focus energy-efficient interventions on the stock of current commercial buildings if we are to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Energy performance, efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions can all be improved in commercial buildings by reducing energy consumption. According to Climate Works Australia and the IPCC, there is a 30% chance of avoiding current energy use while still reaping net economic benefits. To lessen global warming, the IPCC has also recommended that developed nations, like Australia, reduce emissions by 45% by 2030. Buildings with passive technologies can have better energy efficiency without sacrificing comfort. One of the main tactics for lowering energy consumption and carbon emissions in already-existing commercial buildings is energy retrofitting. "Providing a machine with a part, or a place with equipment which was not originally present when it was built" is what the Cambridge Dictionary defines as "retrofitting." However, in this context, it refers to any intervention activity that involves modernizing or repurposing the current structure to satisfy an appropriate requirement. Both cases deal with increasing a building's level of sustainability and energy efficiency through renovations. Multiple combinations of applicable energy consumption-reducing measures that can be applied to retrofit a building present a major challenge to decision-makers in energy retrofit. The evaluation of life cycle cost (LCC) and life cycle analysis (LCA) during retrofits present additional difficulties. LCC and LCA are not used in tandem; additionally, selecting the most appropriate retrofitting strategy or set of measures can occasionally be challenging due to the inclusion of unqualified sustainable technology in listings and selections. The current study intends to address the problems by creating a strong decision support system (RDSS) that integrates sustainable criteria, or triple bottom line TBLs (environmental, social, and economic benefits), in the energy retrofit decision-making process. This will lessen the difficulties encountered in making decisions that will lead to successful building appraisals. The predetermined objectives are meant to lead to the goal. Because of various technological alternatives, it may be vital to have a comparison to simplify sustainable technologies (STs) tools using SWOT/multiple criteria in TBL aspects. Providing an assessment method to merge LCA &amp; LCC to balance environmental and economic performances and determine the impact of the building life cycle on the energy retrofit decision process. Address the challenges decision-makers encounter in dealing with changes due to building markets and regulations since legislation and public expectation drive sustainable buildings. To develop and validate a holistic optimum strategic decision model to select the best retrofit alternatives for a particular building which maximizes the sustainability ranking of the building. Initial research focuses on conducting a life-cycle cost analysis of a commercial office car park building in Sydney, New South Wales. The evaluation includes assessing energy performance through retrofit measures to determine long-term benefits. By using life-cycle cost analysis, the study aims to enhance decision-making in energy assessment. To examine energy consumption intensity, lifecycle costing, CO2 emissions, and cost efficiency, data will be collected from non-green buildings and one building's envelope will be simulated using the Energy Plus tool. Experimental measurements will be compared to validate simulated models. The study includes a case study on a 12,000 square meter commercial office building used as a commercial parking facility. Retrofitting activities were initiated on three office rooms, focusing on HVAC, lighting, and equipment improvements, resulting in a 1.9-year payback period, 15% emissions reduction, 25% energy savings, and 23% cost savings. The subsequent phase involves utilizing various methods such as concept mapping, focus groups, interviews, Questionnaire surveys, and statistical analysis (SPSS) to develop a robust decision support system (RDSS) for sustainable energy retrofits. The overall goal is to establish a systematic decision support system to aid decision-makers and policymakers in improving energy efficiency in commercial office buildings by implementing passive technologies. The system will also recommend strategies to enhance financial outcomes through smart building operations and management implementations.</description>

      <title>Climate and Energy Transitions in Times of Environmental Backlash? The European Union &#8216;Green Deal&#8217; From Adoption to Implementation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/jcms.13675</link>
      <description>Pierre Bocquillon, JCMS Journal of Common Market Studies. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401777155

                The inception of the European Union's (EU's) 'Green Deal' &#8211; a flagship project of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen launched to much acclaim in December 2019 &#8211; contrasts with its adoption in the final years of the Commission's term in office in 2023&#8211;2024. In 2019, unprecedented climate protests and mobilisations across Europe and the world &#8211; from the 'Fridays for Future' school strikes to climate marches and to more radical actions by groups like the Extinction Rebellion (XR) &#8211; pushed climate change and the energy transition to the top of the EU's political agenda. In this context, the 2019 European elections saw unprecedented successes for Green Parties across the continent, boosting the Greens/European Free Alliance (EFA) parliamentary group to a record 72 members (Pearson and R&#252;dig, 2020). With the main centre-left and centre-right groups together failing to command a majority in Parliament, the Greens were able to pressure Ursula von der Leyen to commit to ambitious policies. The EU 'Green Deal' stemmed directly from this context marked by 'enabling politicisation' of the climate issue (Dupont et al., 2024). The EU climate law (Regulation EU 2021/1119, 2021), formally adopted in July 2021, committed the block to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 and reducing net emissions by 55% by 2030, whilst a large legislative package explicitly called 'Fit for 55' was proposed by the Commission that same month to achieve the headline targets. Although the Green Deal has been developed in times of crisis, the Commission and EU have held steady in their commitments (Eckert, 2021; Von Homeyer et al., 2022). Yet, the finalisation of the legislative proposals aimed at turning lofty goals into action in 2023&#8211;2024 &#8211; before the Commission's end of term and EU Parliament elections &#8211; has taken place in a starkly different context. Energy and cost of living crises, initially triggered by post-COVID-19 supply chain disruptions and dramatically heightened by the war in Ukraine leading to energy supply disruptions and commodity price hikes across Europe, have increasingly fuelled concerns about the costs of climate and energy transitions (Goldthau and Youngs, 2023; Kuzemko et al., 2022). Although energy prices have fallen since the end of 2023, cost of living and energy security issues have remained salient. Politically, this context has been instrumentalised by populist and radical right parties to mobilise against the climate and energy transitions (Yazar and Haarstad, 2023), whilst the centre has also become increasingly cautious, especially the centre right. At the European level, this is most evident for the European People's Party (EPP), which has increasingly contested Green Deal legislation, most notably the Nature Restoration Law (Regulation EU 2024/1991, 2024) (Tosun, 2023). This shift is in part a response to protests and contestations of energy and climate legislation across the continent, notably the highly covered farmer's protests starting in late 2023 and continuing throughout the spring of 2024 (Politico, 2024; Reuters, 2023). The June 2024 European Parliament elections reflect this new context, with a rise of far-right groups, whilst the Greens were the main losers along with the liberals (Hix et al., 2024). Against this background of 'constraining politicisation' of climate policy (Dupont et al., 2024), this article asks whether 2023&#8211;2024 represents a turning point for EU commitments to the climate and energy transitions. As a new European Commission and Parliament set in, it is a good time to assess progress and challenges for the EU 'Green Deal'. Has it been faltering? What are the prospects for its implementation and for renewing the EU's green ambitions? I argue that, overall, the agenda for climate action and energy system decarbonisation has proved remarkably resilient. EU institutions and member states have remained committed to delivering the climate and energy dimensions of the Green Deal agenda by the end of the von der Leyen Commission's term and have mostly delivered. Yet, cost concerns, protests and their political use by right-wing populists also raise questions for implementation, possibly dampening ambitions going forward. This article first reviews the progress of the Green Deal legislation and whether the EU has delivered on its ambitions, focusing in particular on energy and climate change. It then assesses the seemingly waning momentum for climate action and the recent 'green backlash'. Finally, it reflects on the prospects for Green Deal implementation and renewal, drawing insights from past crises and their effects on EU environmental and climate policies. It concludes that, whilst the energy and climate transition agenda is likely to prove resilient, its framing and focus may be changing in the context of domestic politicisation of the climate and energy transition and global geopolitical competition. In its initial communication launching the 'Green Deal', the European Commission (2019) presented a wide-ranging strategy to 'make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050', protect biodiversity, create a circular economy, curb pollution and mobilise finance for the green transition, all whilst boosting the competitiveness of European industry and ensuring a just transition for the affected regions and workers. The implementation of this strategy has led to the proposal and subsequent adoption of a wide range of policy packages and individual laws across different sectors, from climate and energy to agriculture, transport and the environment. Since its launch as a core priority of the 'geopolitical Commission' and over the course of its evolution, the contours of the Green Deal as a political object have remained ill-defined. This is in part because it is a cross-cutting strategy reflecting the multisectoral, complex and evolving nature of the climate crisis, which requires climate policy integration across all areas (Dupont et al., 2024). This is also politically deliberate: to reframe and aggregate new and related initiatives as part of an all-encompassing, purposeful and popular narrative. The EU steamed ahead throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024 to finish off the negotiation and adoption of remaining Green Deal files ahead of the June 2024 EU elections, marking the end of the term of both the ninth legislature of the European Parliament and the first von der Leyen Commission. Uncertainty arose when the Commission Vice President and Green Deal chief, Frans Timmermans, known as a heavyweight skilled negotiator and vocal proponent of the Green Deal, left his post to compete in Dutch elections and lead a left-green alliance (Euractiv, 2023a). He was replaced by Commission Vice President Maro&#353; &#352;ef&#269;ovi&#269; and the new controversial Dutch appointee Wopke Hoekstra, criticised for his past employment at Shell and lacklustre record on climate (Taylor, 2023a). Yet, this did not derail work on finalising the Green Deal, which was successful overall with a majority of files adopted and a few blocked or withdrawn due to delays or intractable divisions.1 Looking specifically at the 'Fit for 55' package, which implements the headline emission reduction targets and energy transition objectives, it was originally composed of 13 legislative proposals, later extended to 19.2 As of July 2024, all proposals but one had been adopted by the co-legislators. Some of the legislation updates and strengthens pre-existing legislation, whilst new policies are also introduced. A significant step was the reform of the flagship EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS), adopted in April 2023, along with a raft of associated laws. It accelerates the reduction of emission allowances for energy-intensive industries and the power sector; progressively phases out free allowances; progressively includes shipping within the ETS; strengthens the rules for aviation emissions by phasing out free allowances for domestic flights and implementing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) for extra-European flights; and revises the market stability reserve that aims to maintain stable and effective carbon prices. The reform aims to achieve an emission reduction of 62% in covered sectors by 2030, compared to 2005, a reduction slightly higher than initially proposed by the Commission. In addition, a new and distinct ETS is introduced for buildings, road transport and additional sectors &#8211; all considered hard to decarbonise &#8211; that apply to fuel distributors from 2027. A new Social Climate Fund, mostly supplied by revenues from the new ETS, aims to help vulnerable households, small companies and transport users cope with associated costs. This is a recognition of the concrete impacts and justice implications of this new scheme and an attempt at diffusing contestation to avoid a replay of protracted opposition, such as the 'Yellow Vest' protests that rocked France in 2018&#8211;2020 following an increase in fuel taxes. An innovative and internationally controversial piece of legislation is the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which imposes a carbon tax on imports of products in carbon-intensive industries. CBAM is to be progressively phased in from 2026 in line with the phasing out of free allowances within the ETS, aiming to put EU and third-country industries on a level playing field and avoid carbon leakage &#8211; the outsourcing of industrial emissions to jurisdictions with lower emission standards and costs. In sectors not covered by the ETS (road and domestic maritime transport, buildings, agriculture, waste and small industries), emission reductions are defined by the Effort Sharing Regulation. The revision, adopted in March 2023, increases the 2030 EU-wide target from 29% to 40%, compared with 2005, and distributes the effort with binding national targets. Along with this, the revised Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) regulation of March 2023 includes an increased EU-level target of at least 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent net removals of greenhouse gases for 2030, with associated and binding national targets. A new regulation on tracking and reducing methane emissions in the energy sector, adopted in November 2023, aims to implement the Global Methane Pledge signed along with over 100 countries at the UN Climate COP26. It requires the oil, gas and coal industries to measure, report and verify methane emissions and to put in place mitigation measures for leak detection and repair, as well as for closed wells and mines. For transport, a hard-to-decarbonise sector, a number of new laws were passed in addition to ETS provisions. The regulation on CO2 emission standards for cars and vans, updated and finally adopted in March 2023, introduces progressive emissions reduction targets, including a 100% emission reduction target for 2035, which effectively amounts to a complete phase-out of combustion car and van sales. In parallel, and to facilitate the growth of electric vehicles, the regulation on alternative fuel infrastructure finalised that same month mandates the installation of recharging stations for cars and vans every 60 km, as well as hydrogen refuelling stations for cars and lorries in all urban nodes from 2030 onwards. For shipping, a July 2023 agreement on the FuelEU maritime initiative mandates a reduction of greenhouse gas intensity for the energy used on-board ships by up to 80% by 2050, whilst promoting the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Concerning aviation, the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative adopted in October 2023 aims to promote sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) (e.g., advanced biofuels, renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and recycled fuels meeting sustainability and emissions-saving criteria). It sets obligations for fuel suppliers to ensure that aviation fuels contain minimum shares of SAF (from 2025) and synthetic fuels (from 2030), increasing progressively until 2050. The energy sector also saw key proposals updated. The revision of the flagship renewable energy directive, finally adopted in October 2023, sets a binding target of 42.5% renewable energy in EU final energy consumption by 2030 (up from a paltry 32.5%), with an extra 2.5% indicative top-up to reach the 45% supported by the most ambitious member states and European Parliament. The directive does not set binding national renewable energy targets but introduces a mix of binding and non-binding renewable sub-targets in transport, industry, buildings and district heating and cooling, whilst also mandating faster permitting procedures for renewable energy projects. Increased ambitions are in part the results of the REPowerEU plan of 18 May 2022, adopted in the context of the war in Ukraine and aiming at reducing EU dependence on Russian gas (Von Homeyer et al., 2022; Wendler, 2023). It introduced targeted emergency amendments to increase overall ambitions to 45%. As pointed out by Buzog&#225;ny et al. (2023), the revised renewable energy directive also introduces a high level of flexibility for member states regarding the various sub-targets as a condition of its adoption. Ambitions have also been upgraded for energy efficiency. The revised energy efficiency directive, agreed upon in July 2023, sets a target to reduce final EU energy consumption by 11.7% in 2030 compared to 2020 projections. This is less than the 13% proposed under the REPowerEU plan and, in typical fashion, a middle ground between the more ambitious Parliament and the more cautious Council (Kurmayer, 2023). The directive also includes indicative national contributions for member states, a gradual increase of the annual energy savings target and a specific annual energy consumption reduction for the public sector (including the yearly renovation of a set share of public buildings). The energy efficiency directive is complemented by a revision of the energy performance of buildings directive, completed in 2024, which aims for all new buildings to be zero emission by 2030 and for existing buildings to be retrofitted to have zero emissions by 2050, with mandates for solar energy in buildings and rising minimum energy performance standards and renovation targets. Finally, a regulation and a directive adopted in December 2023 aim to facilitate the shift from natural gas to renewable and low-carbon gases by setting common rules for hydrogen infrastructures and markets. Of the 19 proposals associated with the 'Fit for 55' package, only one remains pending. The proposed revision of the Council directive on the taxation of energy products and electricity aims to switch from energy taxation based on volume to taxation based on energy content. Fossil fuels would be taxed at the highest rate and electricity at the lowest. Energy taxation is a sovereign, sensitive matter and the exclusive competence of the member states under the Lisbon Treaty, decided by the Council subject to unanimity, which has proved a perennial challenge. The 2003 directive sets minimum levels of taxation on energy products, fuels and electricity but places energy sources on an equal footing irrespective of their carbon content. Despite agreement that an update is much overdue, a previous attempt started in 2011 failed in the face of member states' opposition, leading the Commission to withdraw the proposal in 2015. Once again, despite the last-ditch efforts from the Belgian Presidency in the winter of 2024, no agreement could be reached, and its adoption has been postponed to the next legislature (Messad, 2024). Overall, then, despite the challenges associated with post-COVID-19 recovery and the war in Ukraine, from energy supply disruptions to high energy prices, the momentum for climate action and energy system decarbonisation has not evaporated, showing remarkable resilience. EU institutions and member states have remained committed to delivering the climate and energy dimensions of the Green Deal agenda during the term of the von der Leyen Commission and have mostly delivered. Indeed, as many have pointed out, the crises have been reframed into 'windows of opportunity' for furthering the Green Deal agenda (Eckert, 2021; Von Homeyer et al., 2022). The COVID-19 NextGenEU recovery programme of &#8364;750 billion and the associated Recovery and Resilience Facility make new funding available in the form of loans and grants. With member states required to spend at least 37% of their National Recovery and Resilience Plans (NRRPs) in support of the green transition, this additional funding has tended to accelerate ongoing policies and projects rather than new initiatives (Bocquillon et al., 2023). Similarly, the EU's response to the war in Ukraine, in particular the REPowerEU plan to reduce dependence on Russia, has mostly accelerated pre-existing Green Deal dynamics rather than initiated a change of course (Wendler, 2023). It has led to a Commission's legislative proposal for an upgrade of the Green Deal's renewable and energy efficiency targets for 2030 to foster homegrown renewables and reduce imports; additional investments of &#8364;210 billion until 2027 to be defined in new REPowerEU chapters added to NRRPs [with the possibility of financing liquefied natural gas (LNG) infrastructure]; and various soft mechanisms to help diversify supplies (e.g., external engagement strategy, establishment of a new voluntary EU Energy Platform to co-ordinate energy purchases and hydrogen strategy). None of this has upended and, in fact, reinforced the Green Deal's agenda. The jury is still out, however, as to the overall effect of the energy crisis in view of national efforts to shore up short-term fossil fuel supplies with new contracts and infrastructure (Goldthau and Youngs, 2023; Kuzemko et al., 2022). As most energy and climate legislation has been adopted, at least in this first phase of an ever-evolving agenda, attention turns towards implementation, which is crucial to effectiveness and legitimacy. Looking at the period covering the Eurozone crisis for insight, when the salience of and appetite for ambitious environment and climate policies receded, several studies tracked environmental policy dismantling and found real but limited instances in the face of institutional resilience (Gravey and Jordan, 2016). They also point out that there is a risk of policy dismantling 'through the back door' in implementation, notably via delegated and implementing acts (Burns and Tobin, 2020). As is evident from the cursory overview above, adopted legislation is ridden with flexibility mechanisms, such as indicative targets, exemptions and optionality, which may be justified in view of national diversity and indeed necessary to reach agreements, but can also make effective implementation challenging. This is clearly the case with the revised renewable energy directive, with its various sub-targets and differentiated options (see Buzog&#225;ny et al., 2023). Various policies also have phase-in periods and start to kick in progressively, with stringency increasing over time, often beyond 2030 (Von Homeyer et al., 2022). For instance, targets for reducing and phasing out combustion cars will increase, reaching 100% in 2035. This is also the case for CBAM, which has only reporting obligations during a phase-in period, with its tax component entering into force in 2026 in parallel with the phasing out of free ETS allowances. The new ETS enters into force from 2027 onwards. These phase-in and phase-out periods create multiple points where legislation starts 'to bite' for stakeholders. Some of the legislation, like the ban on new combustion engine sales in 2035 or the new building standards, directly impacts European citizens. There is, therefore, potential for politicisation and contestation of the implementation process, which policy-makers may be particularly concerned about. Certain pieces of legislation in the 'Fit for 55' package also have extra-territorial effects, most notably CBAM. It has been actively discussed, criticised and challenged in international forums. For instance, India has threatened a legal challenge under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules against a trade barrier considered especially disadvantageous to developing countries (Euractiv, 2023b). The EU's unilateral approach may trigger international tensions, making implementation challenging (Smith et al., 2024). In a context of geopolitical competition over who controls the energy transition, the Green Deal has increasingly taken a new turn towards green industrial policy. In response to the United States's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and as part of its Green Deal Industrial Plan, the Commission proposed in May 2023, and the co-legislators adopted in March 2024, a new Net Zero Industry Act (NZIA) establishing a non-binding target of 40% strategic 'net-zero' technologies to be produced within the EU, as well as a European Critical Raw Material Act that sets benchmarks for domestic production of key minerals, all whilst aiming to speed up projects. The goal is to secure and reduce dependence on key raw materials and technologies, from the production and import of critical minerals essential for green technologies to battery and electric vehicle production. This industrial and geopolitical framing is likely to become more prominent in the Green Deal to achieve both economic growth and reduced dependence, but it may also fuel international frictions. The economic crisis of the early 2010s showed that, beyond implementation challenges, economic imperatives and environmental objectives could conflict with each other and dampen EU ambitions (Burns et al., 2020; Skovgaard, 2014). Citizens, stakeholders and governments may become less willing to bear the costs of climate action or more cautious about what they can commit to. Crises also offer an opportunity for those against ambitious action to challenge, mobilise and gain legitimacy. Although the climate and energy dimensions of the Green Deal proved relatively resilient with the finalisation of most proposals, the years 2023&#8211;2024 also saw the emergence of a wave of opposition and protests against green policies, including parts of the Green Deal. These protests were widely covered in European and national media, often presented as a 'green backlash' or 'greenlash' (e.g., Politico, 2024; Reuters, 2023; Tash, 2024). Discontent focused on the costs of green policies in a period of cost-of-living crisis and economic downturn, with businesses denouncing the 'regulatory burden' imposed on them. Protests took place across Europe, the West and East and the North and South. Most prominent and widely covered were the farmers' protests that spread across the EU, from Belgium to Germany, France to Spain and Poland to Romania. Often blocking roads, their demands were diverse but tended to focus on costly regulation, notably as part of the greening of the Common Agricultural Policy and biodiversity protection. These protests led to the Commission scrapping a proposal to halve pesticide use in the EU (Tash, 2024). In the Netherlands, plans to cut nitrogen pollution fuelled discontent and the surprise rise of a new farmers' protest party. The backlash was not only limited to farming and conservation, however, with discontent emerging on other issues directly related to energy and climate, such as the phasing out of oil and gas boilers, which nearly broke the German coalition, or the particularly inflammatory phasing out of combustion cars.3 The backlash has been driven by the right and far right (Yazar and Haarstad, 2023). Radical right populists tend to be inimical to climate ambitions, largely on ideological grounds (Lockwood, 2018), even though there is mixed evidence as to their ability to influence EU policy when in power (Huber et al., 2021). Climate policy has become a 'wedge issue' (Dickson and Hobolt, 2024) for these parties, which have politicised it to split and polarise the electorate and shore up support from their climate sceptic base. At the EU level, the far-right grouping of the European Conservatives and Reformists and Identity and Democracy, as well as the centre-right EPP, which is part of the majority coalition, have challenged the purpose and content of pending legislation. The EPP's principal target was the controversial Nature Restoration Law, which sets a target of restoring at least 20% of the EU's land and sea areas by 2030. Building on farmer protests, it failed to block it but was able to considerably weaken the text (Taylor, 2023b). Governments, in turn, responded to domestic pressure or a perceived change of mood. French President Macron's call for a 'European regulatory pause' in the adoption of new green legislation to protect industries (Messad, 2023), supported by other leaders such as Belgian Prime Minister de Croo, came as a shock. The final phase of the negotiations on several files, from car emissions to the energy performance of buildings, saw rising member-state opposition. Poland even initiated legal proceedings against the EU ban on combustion cars in 2035 (Politico, 2023). This picture needs to be nuanced. First, not all parts of the Green Deal have been equally affected. Opposition has tended to concentrate on agriculture reforms and the conservation of nature. Second, the perceived importance of, and support for climate action remain high across member states, at levels broadly similar to 2019, even though climate may have gone down the pecking order of priorities (Eurobarometer, 2023). Despite disruptions and high energy prices due to the war in Ukraine, a majority of respondents to the 2023 special Eurobarometer survey on climate change considered that the transition to a green economy should be sped up. Similarly, Abou-Chadi et al. (2024), based on a representative survey across three countries, argue that the backlash narrative is overblown and largely confined to the far right, with widespread support for climate action and climate policies, provided costs are mitigated through green industrial policies and offsetting measures. Still, the June 2024 European elections indicate challenges ahead for the Green Deal. The main winners were the far-right parties (European Conservatives and Reformists 78, Patriots for Europe 84 and Europe of Sovereign Nations 25) and the centre right (EPP 188), with the main losers being the Greens (Greens/EFA 53) and the liberals (Renew Europe 77). Compared to 2019, when a key signal was a shift towards pro-environment parties and policies, 2024 heralds a shift towards parties with critical positions towards an ambitious environmental agenda, even if the results were arguably not driven by environmental issues. As Hix et al. (2024) and others have pointed out, the new majority will not unravel already adopted legislation, but it could settle for less ambitious climate policies going forward, given the EPP's increasingly critical stance and the fact that the relatively ambitious bloc of the Socialists &amp; Democrats, the liberals and the Greens no longer commands a majority of seats. In her speech to the European Parliament ahead of the vote on her reappointment, which was eventually successful based on a grand coalition against the far right, Ursula von der Leyen reaffirmed her commitment to the bloc's climate objectives, including a yet-to-be-agreed 90% reduction target for 2040, and to further the Green Deal agenda. However, the language suggested a framing focused more on competitiveness and green industrial policy with the promise of a 'Clean Industrial Deal', whilst nature and the environment were only mentioned in general terms (Cagney, 2024). The EU Green Deal illustrates, from its inception to its adoption, the promises and perils &#8211; or inherent tensions &#8211; of the politicisation of climate change (Dupont et al., 2024; Paterson et al., 2022). In 2019, climate movements pushed climate change &#8211; an already well-established and institutionalised policy area &#8211; on top of the EU's political agenda. In this context, the Commission proposed a novel, cross-cutting and relatively ambitious Green Deal, receiving wide support across member states and the political spectrum. In this case, politicisation proved enabling. In contrast, the completion of the Green Deal ahead of EU elections has been marked by a different context, with a section of the impacted stakeholders as well as the radical right and centre right politicising the Green Deal agenda to undermine it &#8211; a form of 'constraining politicisation' (Dupont et al., 2024). The Green Deal has proved relatively resilient to the COVID pandemic and the energy crisis, and implementing legislation has been mostly adopted in 2023 and the first half of 2024 &#8211; at least its energy and climate component. Therefore, it would be hard to undo and unlikely to unravel. Climate and energy policies are well established, benefit from high legitimacy and are deeply institutionalised; in contrast, the biodiversity and farming components of the Green Deal have been subject to deeper challenges. Yet, implementation could prove a challenge for climate and energy, with dismantling through the back door via executive acts; policies that are due to be reviewed and could be weakened; and perhaps most importantly, a lack of ambition and stagnation moving forward. There is, therefore, considerable uncertainty, just as a new cycle of negotiations is opening over the 2040 targets. The Green Deal remains fundamentally a moving political object with blurry boundaries, rather than a 'done deal'. More likely than its faltering, one can expect a change in its framing and focus &#8211; on competitiveness and green industrialisation in particular &#8211; in the context of domestic politicisation of the climate and energy transition and global geopolitical competition. The author would like to thank the Annual Review editors for their support, patience and constructive feedback in producing this piece.</description>

(4) Interest is particularly growing in the Asia-Pacific area with its expanding population, urbanization, and rising disposable incomes which in turn drives the need for innovative green and sustainable chemical technologies that biocatalysis can provide [https://www.unescap.org/projects/gd]. This strong interest in new green technologies has caused a dramatic increase in fundamental research in biocatalysis, with large numbers of research groups from different disciplines entering the field. The breadth of research in biocatalysis in the Asia-Pacific area is showcased in this Virtual Special Issue, titled Biocatalysis in Asia and Pacific, which includes a snapshot of a collection of articles published in JACS Au in 2023/2024.Despite many successes in the general application of biocatalysis in industry, there remain many fundamental scientific challenges, some of which are addressed in this selection of papers. One particular challenge concerns the need for expensive cofactors such as nicotinamides which are for example needed for reduction and oxidation reactions. A perspective describes the very elegant solution of "biocatalytic hydrogen borrowing", which uses multistep sequences including dehydrogenation and hydrogenation in one pot by hydride shuffling between NAD(P)+ and NAD(P)H [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00026]. Another common challenge is active protein expression, and in a novel approach, unspecific peroxygenases have been successfully expressed using a superfolder-green-fluorescent protein in bacteria [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00129]. For multistep biocatalytic processes, cellular engineering guided by proteomic analysis can dramatically increase product titers, as shown for the production of &#945;-bisabolene in yeast [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00106].An area of great interest is the design of reactions and reaction sequences beyond those found in nature. Some successful approaches shown here explore substrate promiscuity for challenging CO2 fixation reactions [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00290] or atroposelective synthesis of aldehydes [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00814]. Alternatively, biocatalysis can be combined with chemical reactions in chemo-enzymatic strategies, including for example Au catalysis [DOIs: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00222, 10.1021/jacsau.3c00688]. Such biocatalytic processes are not only applicable to the synthesis of target molecules but also in bioremediation strategies as demonstrated by removal of the toxic metabolite deoxynivalenol in plants [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00696] and engineering of a metal reductase for the bioremediation of anthropogenic electronic wastes [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00297].In addition to small molecule substrates, biocatalysis is also very attractive for larger biomolecules, such as complex glycoproteins that make up a significant number of the leading biopharmaceutical products. Glycoengineering using biocatalysis provides a tool for improving the therapeutic profile of antibodies, and using a structure-based design approach, an endoglycosidase was engineered to provide a novel toolbox for conjugating glycans to specific glycoprotein sites [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00004]. Glycoengineering often requires sugar nucleotide cofactor regeneration systems, and one such example for UDP-Xylose has been designed as bifunctional chimeras to minimize the need for additional proteins and improved activity [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00288].Computational tools are making a great impact in biocatalysis, in particular in protein engineering, and it is interesting that several papers in this Virtual Special Issue make use of machine learning and modeling tools to find new and better activities: directed evolution and machine learning are used in combination to enhance the diastereoselectivity of a ketoreductase [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00284]. Molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanical calculations have been used to redesign a P450 monooxygenase [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00075]. Computational enzyme redesign has been used to find mutants of a lyase with enhanced tolerance to denaturants for peptide C-terminal amidation [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00792]. Finally, density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamic simulations were used to identify and reduce energy barriers of key transition states to enhance C&#8211;N cleavage efficiency of an amino acid oxidase [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00672].It is striking how even a small collection of papers in biocatalysis from Asia and the Pacific showcases the engagement of a very diverse group of scientists in areas ranging from computational to synthetic chemistry, chemical biology, biochemistry, and synthetic biology to applications in engineering, cell biology, and medicine. Similarly diverse are the challenges addressed beyond the synthesis of bioactive compounds, driven by demands to solve societal problems in medicine with a more green and sustainable production of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical entities. There are also contributions from biocatalysis in directly solving environmental issues such as detoxification, removal of waste from the environment, and CO2 fixation. This Virtual Special Issue clearly shows that the topic of biocatalysis is very actively pursued at the highest international level using leading experimental and computational tools.

These materials encompass various categories and types, including graphene, (1) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), (2) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), (3) MXenes, (4) graphdiyne, (5) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), (6) and monolayer molecular crystals. (7) These materials can exhibit diverse properties as metals, semiconductors, superconductors, insulators, dielectrics, and magnets. Their unique electronic, optical, mechanical, and quantum properties make them suitable for a wide range of applications, from transistors and sensors to quantum information sciences and energy storage. With their highly tunable and versatile physical properties, these atomically thin materials could promise technological opportunities beyond the reach of existing materials.With a thickness measured by a single atom or a few atoms and lateral dimensions extending up to the meter scale, 2D materials feature an extreme aspect ratio of up to 109 or larger. This extreme aspect ratio necessitates highly anisotropic growth, with growth rates differing by millions or billions of times across different dimensions, posing a fundamentally new synthetic challenge. Achieving consistent single-atom thickness while expanding laterally to macroscopic scale requires fine-tuned control over the nucleation and growth process. Precision chemistry holds the key to the production of uniform 2D materials, (8) their heterostructures, (9) and superlattices, (10,11) which are central for consistent electronic and optical properties. Understanding the fundamental growth mechanisms is essential for the controlled synthesis of 2D materials with specific stacking orders, symmetry, and phase characteristics, fundamentally determining their properties. (12) By precisely controlling doping levels, edge termination, heterostructure formation, and intercalation of functional species, researchers can further tailor the electronic and chemical properties of 2D materials, enhancing their functionality for various applications. (13) Given the extreme surface-to-volume ratio of 2D materials, precision surface chemistry is also critical for manipulating and optimizing relevant physical properties, including surface functionalization, surface protection, charge density, and other exotic properties such chiral optical and spintronic properties. Proper surface modification may also enhance the stability and performance of 2D materials in various applications.Precision chemistry plays a central role in tailoring the atomic and molecular structures of 2D materials, thereby unlocking their full potential in various high-impact areas such as lower-power electronics, energy storage, catalysis, and sensing. Precise control over dimensions, chemical compositions, impurity doping, heterostructure interface, or surface modification makes it possible to finely tune the electronic properties of 2D materials, including bandgap engineering, carrier density, and mobility regulation, which are crucial for applications in transistors, sensors, and other electronic devices. 2D materials exhibit unique optical properties, such as layer-number tunable photoluminescence and strong light&#8211;matter interactions. (14,15) Precision control over their synthesis allows for the optimization of these properties for use in optoelectronic devices and photodetectors. At the atomic scale, quantum effects become significant. Precision chemistry allows for the control over quantum properties such as spin, (16) valley polarization, (17) charge correlation, (18) and single photon emission, (19) which are important for emerging quantum technologies. (20) Additionally, 2D materials are also promising candidates for energy conversion and storage applications due to their high surface area and unique electrochemical properties. A precise control of their synthesis, surface modification, heteroatom doping, and assembly in higher-order superstructures is critical for capturing the merits of 2D materials in supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells, or green hydrogen production. (21&#8722;24)This Special Issue (including Part I and Part II) in Precision Chemistry titled "Precision Chemistry for Two-Dimensional Materials" features the latest research and perspectives from the leading scientists in this rapidly developing field, highlighting the development and application of precision chemistry for scalable synthesis of 2D materials, including large-area thin films, single crystals, heterostructures, and superlattices of various 2D materials, as well as rational tailoring of their chemical and physical properties for various applications in unconventional electronics, sensing, catalysis, energy storage, and molecular nanofiltration.The liquid-phase exfoliation technique offers a top-down strategy for scalable processing of 2D-TMDs in large quantities. The review authored by Pawin Iamprasertkun et al. offers insights into liquid exfoliation, particularly focusing on optimizing nanosheet yield while preserving their intrinsic properties. (25) Advocating for a data-driven approach and the integration of machine learning, this review offers a comprehensive guide for researchers and practitioners in the field of 2D materials, providing valuable insights for optimizing production processes and enhancing material properties through an integration of traditional synthesis techniques with modern analytical tools.The chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process offers an appealing bottom-up strategy for the large-area synthesis of high-quality 2D materials. Xidong Duan and colleagues review the spin-coating precursor mediated CVD (SCVD) strategy for the growth of high-quality 2D TMDs. (26) This method offers a refined and scalable alternative to traditional CVD, providing more facile control over material thickness and purity. The review illuminates a path toward uniform production of TMDs over large areas. The exploration of novel precursors and substrate engineering within the SCVD process is particularly noteworthy, as it expands the horizons for TMD synthesis and integration into heterostructures and selectively doped materials.In semiconductor electronics, the integration of high-&#954; dielectric materials is essential for next-generation electronics. Li Lin and co-authors report the successful synthesis of large-sized van der Waals layered MoO3 single crystals. (27) These layered crystals, with their improved dielectric performance, offer an attractive dielectric material for future 2D electronics, particularly for applications requiring strong gate control and low power consumption. This work is crucial for those seeking to enhance gate control and reduce power consumption in electronic components.Taking a step further, Kaihui Liu and co-workers address the critical challenge of growing noncentrosymmetric 2D materials on centrosymmetric substrates, a process complicated by the energetic equivalency of antiparallel islands on centrosymmetric substrates. (28) Their review outlines strategies and advancements in producing noncentrosymmetric 2D materials over large-area substrates, a critical step toward large-area 2D single crystals for high-end electronic and optoelectronic devices. They further provide a forward-looking perspeptive on the growth of layer-, stacking-, and twist-controlled noncentrosymmetric 2D single crystals and their heterostructures, providing a beacon for future direction in synthetic control of 2D materials.In a theory study, Feng Ding and co-workers used density functional theory (DFT) to examine the gold surface reconstruction processes that occur in sulfur-rich environments during the growth of TMDs, (29) shedding light on an important yet underexplored aspect of 2D material synthesis. The study fundamentally revealed the formation of stable metal sulfide buffer layers, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms that influence TMDs growth on gold substrates. This research highlights how theory can help develop a precision understanding and guide further optimization of 2D material growth on the optimum substrates.2D van der Waals heterostructures consisting of vertically stacked 2D atomic layers have emerged as a rich testing bed for uncovering new electronic, magnetic, and other unique properties, defining a versatile material platform for fundamental physics and device applications. Libo Gao and co-workers present a perspective on the emerging field of 2D van der Waals superconductor heterostructures, (30) focusing on Josephson junctions and their potential applications in condensed matter physics and materials science, highlighting the exciting potential of 2D superconductor heterostructures for future technological innovations.Impurity doping offers a powerful stragey to manipulate the electronic properties of 2D materials. Xiangfeng Duan and co-workers present the precision control of amphoteric doping in CuxBi2Se3 nanoplates. (31) The research uncovers a transition from intercalative to substitutional doping sites with increasing copper concentrations, which significantly alters the electronic behavior of the materials. Notably, the study demonstrates that a specific doping level in Cu0.18Bi2Se3 induces superconducting properties not found in the undoped Bi2Se3, further underscoring the transformative potential of precise doping on materials properties. This work highlights intercalation as a versatile avenue for the design of materials with tailored electronic properties and quantum behaviors for applications in advanced electronics and quantum technologies.Monolayer molecular crystals (MMCs) have emerged as an intriguing class of 2D materials, offering exciting potential for wide tunability and a myriad of applications. The quest for precision in their preparation is not just a scientific endeavor but a critical foundation for technological innovation. Lang Jiang and his colleagues review the progress in solution-processed MMCs, (32) presenting the current challenges and future prospects and highlighting their exceptional properties for applications in organic field-effect transistors, sensing technologies, and optoelectronic devices.Forming 2D organic/inorganic hybrids provides a versatile strategy to further tailor the physical properties and and enrich the chemical functionalities. Jun Lou and co-workers report a general approach for the seamless integration of 2D COFs with inorganic 2D materials. (33) This controlled synthesis method leverages the unique chemical nature of 2D inorganic materials to catalyze formation of COFs with diverse functionalities. The resulting hybrids exhibit well-controlled 2D morphology together with excellent dispersibility and processibility. This work offers a facile strategy for the scalable production of 2D organic/inorganic hybrids that of are great interest for diverse technologies including water treatment and energy storage.Graphdiyne represents a newer and rapidly evolving 2D carbon material with unique structure and fascinating properties. The discovery of graphdiyne has opened up exciting opportunities in the fundamental research and practical applications of carbon nanomaterials. (5) Yuliang Li and co-workers provide a systematic review of the precisely controlled synthesis of graphdiyne-based materials (34) and highlight how precision chemistry can be used to tailor this unique class of materials as multiscale catalysts in various catalysis and energy conversion areas, including ammonia synthesis, hydrogen production, and CO2 conversion, showcasing the potential of precisely engineered 2D materials for targeted applications.In summary, this two-part Special Issue of Precision Chemistry highlights the critical role of precision chemistry in the synthesis, control, and utilization of atomically thin 2D materials.
