                Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to valuable fuels and chemical feedstock is a sustainable strategy to lower the anthropogenic CO 2 concentration, thereby dynamising the carbon cycle in the environment. CH 3 OH on the other hand is undoubtedly the most desirable C 1 product of CO 2 RR. However, selective electroreduction of CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;CH 3 OH is very challenging and only limited catalysts are reported in literature. Pyrolyzing metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) to generate carbon matrix impregnated with metal nanoparticles, heralds exciting electrocatalytic properties. This study unveiled the morphological evolution of a mixed&#8208;ligand Ni&#8208;MOF (Ni&#8208;OBBA&#8208;Bpy) during pyrolysis, to generate Ni nanoparticles anchored 0D porous hollow carbon superstructures (Pyr&#8208;CP&#8208;800 and Pyr&#8208;CP&#8208;600). This unique morphology invokes high specific surface area and surface roughness to the materials, which synergistically facilitates the selective electroreduction of CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;CH 3 OH. In comparison to most of the previously reported Ni electrocatalysts that mainly produced CO, Pyr&#8208;CP&#8208;800 selectively yielded CH 3 OH with Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 32.46% at &#8722;0.60 V versus RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) in 1.0 M KOH solution, which is highest among other reported Ni&#8208;based electrocatalysts in the literature, to best of our knowledge. Additionally, insights from density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Ni (111) plane to be the active site toward the electrochemical. CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;CH 3 OH formation.</description>

                This chapter discusses the progress in non-Cu-based electrocatalysts employed in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), a strategy for transforming carbon dioxide into useful chemicals and fuels while addressing environmental and energy concerns. While Cu-based catalysts have been largely explored, high production costs necessitate a shift in focus toward non-Cu-based catalysts, particularly those facilitating selective production of carbon monoxide (CO) and formate. This chapter provides insight into the performance of these catalysts and highlights the significance of understanding their structure&#8211;performance relationships. Simultaneously, it emphasizes the need for consistent exploration of innovative, high-performing catalysts, development of enhanced characterization techniques, and understanding how reaction conditions influence CO 2 RR efficiency. Moreover, this chapter also offers a comprehensive but succinct perspective on the challenges and future trajectories of non-Cu-based catalysts in CO 2 RR.</description>

                Given the increasingly severe global climate change and energy crisis, the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into very valuable chemicals has been proposed as an attractive solution. The electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) represents a remarkably efficient pathway for reducing CO2 under mild conditions. Metal cluster-based crystalline materials (MCMs) have garnered significant interest in the area of CO2RR because of their elevated concentration of active sites, tunable backbone structures, and excellent stability. These materials enable precise control of metal valence states and charge transfer pathways, offering a variety of reduction pathways for CO2RR. Herein, we examine the utilization of MCMs in eCO2RR in recent years. We cover the fundamental principles of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, the synthesis approaches for these materials, and the connection between structural characteristics and catalytic performance. Additionally, the paper delves into the challenges and opportunities presented by MCMs for enhancing CO2RR efficiency and selectivity. Herein, we aim to provide researchers with a new perspective on MCMs in the field of eCO2RR, thereby improving understanding of the relationship between structure and performance. Ultimately, this work seeks to advance the technology for eCO2RR, contributing significantly to sustainable energy production and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions.</description>

      <title>Reversibly Modulating the Selectivity of Carbon Dioxide Reduction via Ligand-Driven Spin Crossover</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.4c02813</link>
      <description>Yuan Tang, Xiangyu Zhu, Qiquan Luo, Cen&#8208;Feng Fu, Xingxing Li, The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405464003

                Selectivity is an essential aspect in catalysis. At present, the improvement of the selectivity for complex reactions with multiple pathways/products, for example the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), can usually be achieved for only one pathway/product. It is still a challenge to reversibly modulate the selectivity between two reaction pathways or products of the CO2RR by one catalyst. Here, we propose the reversible modulation of selectivity between two products via spin crossover. By employing first-principles calculations, six spin crossover molecular catalysts are found among 17 kinds of transition metal embedded porphyrin derivatives (ppy_TM), where the changes in axial ligand configurations can reversibly switch the spin state of catalysts between high spin and low spin. For ppy_Os and ppy_Ru, the alteration in spin state can effectively influence the reduction of CO2 into either formic acid or carbon monoxide by changing the relative stability of the key intermediates *COOH and *HCOO.</description>

      <title>Effect of overlapping layout of Fe/TiO2 on CO2 reduction with H2 and H2O</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.15406/mojsp.2019.03.00028</link>

                Fe-doped TiO2 (Fe/TiO2) film photocatalyst was prepared by sol-gel dip-coating, and pulse arc plasma process. The netlike glass fiber was used as a base material for the photocatalyst since it had a porous structure. The CO2 reduction performance with H2 and H2O into CO over the Fe/TiO2 photocatalyst was investigated. In addition, this study investigated overlapping two Fe/TiO2 coated on netlike glass fiber in order to utilize the light more effectively as well as increase the amount of photocatalyst for CO2 reduction. The characterization of prepared Fe/TiO2 film coated on netlike glass fiber was analyzed by SEM, EPMA, TEM, EDX and EELS. Furthermore, the CO2 reduction performance of the Fe/TiO2 film was tested under a Xe lamp with or without ultraviolet (UV) light, respectively. The results show that the CO2 reduction performance peaks under the condition of CO2/H2/H2O=1:1:0.5 in both cases with UV light and without UV light illumination. The highest concentration of CO with the Fe/TiO2 overlapped photocatalyst is 1.2 times of that with the single Fe/TiO2 photocatalyst. On the other hand, results also show the highest molar quantity of CO per weight of photocatalyst for Fe/TiO2 overlapped is almost half of single Fe/TiO2.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Two Crosslinked Polymer Systems Including Hydrolyzed Polyacrylamide and Acrylic Acid&#8211;Hydrolyzed Polyacrylamide Co-Polymer for Carbon Dioxide and Formation Water Diversion Through Relative Permeability Reduction in Unconsolidated Sandstone Formation</title>

                One of the most challenging aspects of manipulating the flow of fluids in subsurfaces is to control their flow direction and flow behavior. This can be especially challenging for compressible fluids, such as CO2, and for multiphase flow, including both water and carbon dioxide (CO2). This research studies the ability of two crosslinked polymers, including hydrolyzed polyacrylamide and acrylic acid/hydrolyzed polyacrylamide crosslinked polymers, to reduce the permeability of both CO2 and formation water using different salinities and permeability values and in the presence of crude oil under different injection rates. The result showed that both polymers managed to reduce the permeability of water effectively; however, their CO2 permeability-reduction potential was much lower, with the CO2 permeability reduction being less than 50% of the water reduction potential in the majority of the experiments. This was mainly due to the high flow rate of the CO2 compared to the water, which resulted in significant shearing of the crosslinked polymer. The crosslinked polymers&#8217; swelling ratios were impacted differently based on the salinity, with the maximum swelling ratio being 9.8. The HPAM polymer was negatively affected by the presence of crude oil, whereas increasing salinity improved its performance greatly. All in all, both polymers had a higher permeability reduction for the formation water compared to CO2 under all conditions. This research can help improve the applicability of CO2-enhanced oil recovery and CO2 storage in depleted oil reservoirs. The ability of the crosslinked polymers to improve CO2 storage will be a main focus of future research.</description>

                The article discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to optimize urban planning and reduce CO2 emissions. In the context of increasing urbanization and green-house gas emissions, cities are faced with the need to find innovative solutions for sustainable development. AI provides a wide range of tools for data analysis, modeling and prediction, which allows developing and implementing more effective urban management strategies. The main fo-cus is on intelligent transport systems that optimize traffic flows, control traffic lights and predict routes, which leads to reduced congestion and carbon dioxide emissions. It also considers the use of AI for energy management in buildings, the development of "smart" homes and offices that automatically adapt to operating conditions and minimize energy costs.</description>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been proved as a promising pathway for valuable chemical production and sustainable carbon cycling. Various regulatory strategies have been explored to boost CO2RR performance. Among these, metal&#8208;based electrocatalytic CO2RR systems regulated by organic modifiers have been shown to play a pivotal role in regulating the complex catalytic processes. Herein, we provide an overview of the recent effective research for regulating the organic modifiers on metal&#8208;based catalyst to enhance CO2RR performance. Two main fundamental mechanisms of enhanced CO2RR with organic modifiers are discussed, including controlling the local microenvironment (local concentration of reactant/intermediate, local pH, local electric field) at the electrode surface and modulating intrinsic catalytic active sites (crystal and electronic structure). Moreover, effective strategies to preserve a stable organic modifier/catalysts interface are also reviewed. Finally, the challenges and prospects faced by organic modifiers regulated metal&#8208;based catalyst in CO2RR are proposed. We hope this review will provide a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the actual impacts of organic modifiers on the development of efficient CO2RR catalysts with favorable activity, selectivity, and stability.</description>

                The utilization of renewable energy for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2RR) represents a significant advancement in green carbon conversion technologies. Single atom catalysts (SACs) featuring a transition metal&#8208;nitride&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;Nx&#8208;C) architecture exhibit catalytic activity for the reduction of CO2 to CO. However, the impact of the morphology of carbon supports, particularly their pore structure, on the electrocatalytic performance of CO2RR warrants further investigation. In this study, we fabricated a series of Ni&#8208;based SACs supported by porous carbon nanofibers through electrospinning and sacrificial template method. We examined variations in microstructure of these porous carbon nanofiber carriers at different pyrolysis temperatures and elucidated their effects on CO2RR catalytic performance. The catalyst obtained at 1000 &#176;C demonstrated efficient electrocatalysis for converting CO2 to CO due to its large specific surface area, abundant hierarchical pore structure, and high content of Ni&#8208;Nx species resulting from both the sacrificial template method and high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis. A Faradaic efficiency exceeding 90% was sustained across potentials ranging from &#8722;0.7 V to &#8722;1.3 V (vs. RHE), with a peak efficiency reaching 96.1% at &#8722;1.0 V (vs. RHE). Kinetic analysis indicated that this sample exhibited the highest reaction kinetics alongside minimal charge transfer resistance.</description>

                The increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels can lead to climate change and adversely affect human health. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method to capture CO2 and convert it into a more valuable substance, such as methanol. In this study, we established a tandem system involving dye-sensitized solar cells and photoelectrochemical (DSSC-PEC), which included the PEC zone using CuO/dark TiO2 nanotube array (CuO/dTNA) as the dark cathode where CO2 reduction takes place, and Co-Pi/blue TiO2 nanotube array (Co-Pi/bTNA) as the counter photoanode. For the DSSC zone, N719/TNA was used as the photoanode, I-/I3- electrolyte, and Pt/FTO as the cathode. The tandem system was constructed by connecting the PEC cathode to the DSSC photoanode and the PEC photoanode to the DSSC cathode using silver wire. Under solely visible light induction and water containing sodium bicarbonate electrolyte saturated with CO2, the proposed devise produced methanol at 1.292 &#956;mol/hour.

                Abstract The growth rate of transportation sector&#8217;s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is rigid, making it difficult to reduce emissions, especially for developing countries. The existing literature has not yet fully investigated the CO2 emissions reduction effect of transportation structural adjustment from the perspective of improving productivity, which is defined by total factor energy efficiency (TFEE) in this study. To close this knowledge gap, we first evaluated the TFEE of the transportation sector as a whole and its sub-sectors in 30 provinces in China from 2013 to 2021 based on the parallel data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and then estimated the energy conservation and emissions reduction potentials brought about by the optimization of the transportation structure based on the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model. The main results show: (1) TFEEs vary greatly across sub-sectors and provinces, with provinces performing differently across sub-sectors. (2) Compared with the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, the structure enhancement (SE) scenario of structural adjustment can cumulatively reduce CO2 emissions by 289.20 Mt by 2030. (3) In the SE scenario, the energy demand will peak in 2026 and the CO2 emissions will peak at 1509.55 MT in 2027. These results indicate that the CO2 reduction from the transportation restructuring (structural effect) can exceed the increase in CO2 emissions following an increase in transportation activity (scale effect) and eventually bring down the total CO2 emissions for the transportation sector, despite the TFEE rankings of the subsector varying across regions. Therefore, policies that value regions with large volumes, a high share of road transport, and well-established infrastructure, can achieve greater potential to reduce carbon emissions.</description>

      <title>Carbon Removal Accounting for a Sustainable Future: Distributing CO2 Flows in Multiservice Systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su162410909</link>
      <description>Gonzalo Rodriguez-Garc&#237;a, Miguel Brand&#227;o, Robert P. Anex, Sustainability. 16(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405317727

                Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) systems are an integral part of sustainable pathways limiting global warming to less than 2.0 &#176;C. When the sole purpose of CDR is capturing and storing atmospheric CO2, carbon registries offer detailed procedures to calculate the carbon removal credits. However, the registries do not address how to distribute CO2 flows when CDR provides additional services. Standardized, transparent rules for distributing CO2 flows among CDR services are required for the formation of efficient private and public carbon markets. The lack of such rules could result in double counting if those reductions are allocated to more than one service, decreasing the trustworthiness of carbon removal credits or deterring the delivery of an additional low-carbon service, thus limiting the economic viability and deployment of CDR. We examine allocation rules in carbon registries and carbon accounting guidelines, including their life cycle assessment (LCA) principles. We evaluate physical (mass-based) and non-physical (economic) allocation methods using a generic CDR system and find both to be unworkable. We then develop a mass balance (MB) approach which can reliably allocate captured and stored carbon (CSC) between carbon removal credits and other services based on the value CO2 removal in those markets. This practical approach to allocation can be used in a transparent way to provide flexibility that would allow CDR services to capture the value of the multiple services they provide and, through this, promote the deployment of these sustainable alternatives.</description>

      <title>Understanding Emission Trends, Regional Distribution Differences, and Synergistic Emission Effects in the Transportation Sector in Terms of Social Factors and Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su162410971</link>

                China&#8217;s transportation sector plays a significant role in reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) and air pollution. Previous studies have predominantly utilized scenario analysis to forecast emissions for the next 30 to 50 years based on coefficients from a base year. To elucidate the current state of gas emissions in the transportation sector, this study employed panel data for 10 types of gas emissions from 2001 to 2020, analyzing their emission characteristics, tendencies, and synergistic effects. Utilizing the Kaya equation and the logarithmic mean division index (LMDI) decomposition method, we developed a model of pollutant emissions that considers the synergistic effects, pollution emission intensity, energy mix, energy consumption intensity, and population. The results show that all pollutants in the transportation sector decreased except for NH3 and CO2. There was a synergistic effect between air pollutants and CO2 emissions, but the reduction was not significant. From 2013 to 2020, the transportation sector shifted from a high emission intensity with low synergy to a low emission intensity with high synergy. The results indicate that off-road mobile vehicles, on-road diesel vehicles, and motorcycles became the main source of emissions from transportation in certain provinces, and a key area requiring attention in policy development. Gasoline consumption was identified as the primary contributor to the significant increase in synergistic emission variability in the transportation sector. These results provide policymakers with practical ways to optimize emission reduction pathways.</description>

      <title>Will Climate Change Alter the Swimming Behavior of Larval Stone Crabs?: A Guided-Inquiry Lesson</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5334/cjme.117</link>
      <description>Abigail L. Smith, Jean Labadie, Angela Busse, E. Solomon, Clare Farrell, Daniel M. Holstein, Z. George Xue, Philip M. Gravinese, Current The Journal of Marine Education. 39(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405285744

                The ocean has absorbed ~one third of the excess atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) released since the Industrial Revolution. When the ocean absorbs excess CO2, a series of chemical reactions occur that result in a reduction in seawater pH, a process called ocean acidification. The excess atmospheric CO2 is also resulting in warmer seawater temperatures. These stressors pose a threat to marine organisms, especially during earlier life stages (i.e., larvae). The larvae of species like the Florida stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) are free swimming, allowing a population to disperse and recruit into new habitats. After release, stone crab larvae undergo vertical swimming excursions in response to abiotic stimuli (gravity, light, pressure) allowing them to control their depth. Typically, newly hatched larvae respond to abiotic cues that would promote a shallower depth distribution, where surface currents can transport them offshore to complete development. As larvae develop offshore, they become less sensitive to certain abiotic stimuli, which promotes a deeper depth distribution that may expose them to variable current speeds, thus influencing the direction of advection (horizontal movement). Environmental stressors like ocean acidification and elevated seawater temperatures may also impact the larvae&#8217;s natural response to these abiotic stimuli throughout ontogeny (development). Changes in their natural swimming behavior due to climate stressors could, therefore, influence the transport and dispersal of the species. This guided-inquiry lesson challenges introductory marine biology and oceanography students to determine how future ocean pH and temperature projections could impact the swimming behavior of Florida stone crab larvae.</description>

      <title>From Disposal to Reuse: Carbon Emission Assessments and Reduction Strategies for Household Refrigerators</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3808/jeil.202400144</link>
      <description>Lixi Huang, Yu&#8208;Fei Wu, Huifang Han, X. Q. Ren, Gao Hu, Manman Zhai, C. Y. Chen, Journal of Environmental Informatics Letters. 12(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405400467

                The issue of global climate change is highly critical, and the dual-carbon targets are extremely urgent. The home appliance industry, as a significant component of the manufacturing sector, establishing a green and standardized industrial system is an essential measure to mitigate the impact of global warming. The amount of typical home appliance waste is increasing day by day, and the accounting and analysis of carbon dioxide emissions in the waste disposal process serve as crucial references for establishing a low-carbon industry. This paper employs the life cycle assessment method, targeting the waste disposal process of typical home appliances. A refrigerator is selected as the research object to calculate the carbon dioxide emissions in the three stages of recovery, disassembly, and reuse in the waste disposal process. A comparative analysis is conducted on the carbon dioxide emissions of producing 1 kg of recycled materials and primary materials. The most effective carbon reduction measures for different home appliances are evaluated to provide suggestions and references for promoting the low-carbon and green development of the industry. The final conclusions are as follows: (1) The results of the life cycle assessment indicate that there are significant differences in carbon emissions in different processing stages. Among them, the carbon emissions in the iron recovery stage are the highest, accounting for 87% of the total emissions, while the carbon emissions in the copper recovery stage are the lowest, accounting for only 0.6% of the total emissions. (2) During the process of producing 1 kg of recycled materials, the carbon dioxide emissions in the iron recycling stage are the highest. Compared with the production of 1 kg of primary materials, the carbon dioxide emissions in the primary stages of aluminum, copper, iron, and plastic are all higher than those in the recycling stages.</description>

                The rise in global temperatures, driven by carbon dioxide emissions, has spurred the construction industry to seek carbon reduction strategies. This study evaluates the environmental benefits of using wood materials in construction by redesigning an existing reinforced concrete (RC) residential building in New Taipei City, Taiwan. Four structural combinations were developed, replacing concrete with timber and steel. Numerical simulations confirmed the feasibility of these systems, and comparisons of embodied carbon, costs, and construction periods were conducted. The proposed hybrid models, which extensively replace concrete with timber and steel for the core, reduced initial embodied carbon by 25.6% compared to the original RC building, though costs increased by 3.9 times. These findings underscore the potential of hybrid timber systems as a sustainable alternative in construction, offering significant carbon reduction benefits for Taiwan while aligning with environmental goals.</description>

                Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) can effectively activate inert carbon dioxide molecules into more helpful fuels and chemicals for human life, which is considered to be one of the most potential ways to achieve the goal of carbon neutralization in the future. So far, using electrocatalytic technology to reduce CO 2 molecules into single-carbon products is very mature, but it is still a great challenge to obtain multicarbon products with more practical values. For this reason, it is urgent to design and synthesize electrocatalysts with ultrahigh selectivity, stability, and excellent activity. Crystalline porous materials (such as metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF), covalent organic framework (COF), and their corresponding derived porous materials) provide great opportunities for the activation and transformation of CO 2 because of their large specific surface area, high porosity, controllable structure and morphology, and modified framework, making them a promising candidate material for CO 2 RR. This chapter summarizes in detail the latest research progress on porous materials as typical functional porous framework catalysts in the field of CO 2 RR, providing new horizons and ideas for future exploration in this important field.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Challenges and Strategies for Corporate Energy Conservation and Carbon Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.47260/amae/15110</link>
      <description>Cheng-Wen Lee, Mao-Wen Fu, Advances in management and applied economics. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405308952

                Abstract This study aims to investigate the challenges and dilemmas that enterprises face in pursuing energy conservation and carbon reduction. It emphasizes that while promoting carbon reduction not only helps protect the environment and enhances corporate image, but also leads to long-term operational cost savings, numerous hurdles still exist in practice. These challenges include technical constraints, high investment costs, and uncertainties surrounding policies and regulations. Current literature largely focuses on the impact of macro policies on corporate carbon reduction, often neglecting a micro-level analysis of firms' motivations and practices, especially among small and medium-sized enterprises and non-high-emission industries. This study systematically identifies the factors influencing corporate energy conservation and carbon reduction through comprehensive text and policy analysis. The findings suggest that policy formulation should take into account the varying sizes of enterprises, increase oversight of larger companies, offer targeted support for SMEs, and work to bridge the capacity gap among businesses. As countries actively implement emissions reduction policies, companies are becoming more aware of and responsive to the need for lowering carbon emissions; however, sustained efforts are essential to achieve long-term objectives. The study provides several suggestions for governments to develop differentiated policy measures, enhance corporate education and training initiatives, promote the adoption of new technologies, improve regulatory incentive mechanisms, and establish industry-specific emissions reduction roadmaps. At the enterprise level, it is crucial to integrate carbon reduction into long-term strategies and align it with the industry supply chain. Achieving the goal of net-zero carbon emissions will necessitate collaborative efforts from governments, businesses, and society as a whole. JEL classification numbers: H25, I115, J48.

      <title>Testing Exhaust Emissions of Plug-In Hybrid Vehicles in Poland</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17246288</link>
      <description>Jacek Pielecha, W. Gis, Energies. 17(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405374914

                The article addresses the usage patterns of plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) under Polish conditions. The conventional approach to operating such vehicles assumes that they are used with a fully charged battery at the start. However, the economic circumstances of Polish users often do not allow for daily charging of vehicles from the domestic power grid. As a result, these vehicles are used not only in a mode powered solely by the internal combustion engine but also in a mode where the internal combustion engine is primarily utilized to charge the battery. An analysis was conducted on various ways of operating plug-in vehicles, evaluating not only harmful emissions but also fuel consumption (for battery states of charge: SOC = 100%, SOC = 50%, SOC = 0%, and SOC = 0 &#8594; 100%&#8212;forced charging mode). The study focused on the most characteristic vehicle segment in Poland, SUVs, and employed a methodology for determining exhaust emissions under real-world driving conditions. Results indicate that forced charging of such a vehicle&#8217;s battery leads to over a 25-fold increase in carbon dioxide emissions (fuel consumption) in urban areas compared to operating the vehicle with a fully charged battery (CO&#8212;25&#215; increase, NOx&#8212;12&#215; increase, PN&#8212;11&#215; increase). Operating a plug-in SUV without charging it from the power grid results in a 13-fold increase in fuel consumption compared to using the vehicle with a fully charged battery (CO&#8212;10&#215; increase, NOx&#8212;6&#215; increase, PN&#8212;4&#215; increase). The emission results were used to evaluate Poland&#8217;s charging infrastructure in the context of PHEV usage. The current state of the infrastructure and its development plans for 2030 and 2040 were analyzed. It was found that significant reductions in fuel consumption (by approximately 30%) and CO2 emissions are achievable by 2040. Emissions of CO, NOx, and PN are expected to decrease by about 10%, primarily due to the internal combustion engine operating at high load conditions in non-urban or highway scenarios.</description>

                Abstract Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) utilization technology is of great significance for achieving carbon neutrality, in which the catalytic materials play crucial roles, and among them, single&#8208;atom alloys (SAAs) are of particular interests. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and machine learning are employed to assess the effectiveness of Cu&#8208;, Ag&#8208;, and Ni&#8208;host SAAs as catalysts for electrochemical CO 2 reduction to CH 3 OH. The Gibbs free energies of 477 elementary reactions across 35 SAAs involved in CO 2 reduction are calculated, and by utilizing this dataset, a trained gradient boosting regression model is established with an excellent accuracy. Subsequently, the properties of 46 unknown SAAs are predicted, including their pathways, products, potential&#8208;determining steps (PDS), and corresponding Gibbs free energies of the PDS ( G PDS ). Three promising candidates, ZnCu, AuAg and MoNi, stand out due to their lowest G PDS among Cu&#8208;, Ag&#8208; and Ni&#8208; hosted SAAs, respectively.</description>

      <description>Tetsuo Umegaki, Kei Sato, Kenjiro Saeki, Yoshiyuki Kojima, ChemistrySelect. 9(47)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405440172

                Abstract Porous silica&#8211;ruthenium oxide composite catalysts were prepared with sol&#8211;gel&#8208;based method using a cationic surfactant, cethyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), as templates to form well&#8208;ordered nanopores in the catalyst particles. The previously reported heterogeneous catalysts for hydrogenation of carbon dioxide into formic acid generally worked as metallic state, while the catalyst in the present study worked without reduction procedure for the catalyst activation to obtain the metallic states of the active ruthenium species. The textural properties of the catalysts in this work were affected by various pretreatment procedures, and washing and calcination pretreatments were identified as effective procedures to remove the surfactant micelle templates with 2&#8211;4 times higher specific surface area and pore volumes. The catalytic activity also improved with the pretreatments, and the catalyst with washing followed by calcination showed nearly three times higher activity than the catalyst without any pretreatments. The crystalline size of the active ruthenium species and the catalytic performance of porous silica&#8211;ruthenium oxide composite catalyst was influenced by amount of TEOS, the catalyst including small RuO 2 crystalline phase was obtained with high amount of TEOS and exhibited high activity for hydrogenation of carbon dioxide into formic acid with comparative TON to previously reported metallic ruthenium&#8208;based catalysts.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Green Development of Industrial Parks on the Reduction of Carbon Emissions in Urban Areas&#8212;Empirical Research on Green Industrial Parks in China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2024ef005161</link>

                Abstract China has over 2,500 national and provincial industrial parks, stimulating the economics growth, meanwhile being the primary sources of carbon dioxide emissions and other pollutants. Assessing the mechanisms and impacts of the policies of pilot programs of green industrial parks on urban carbon emissions offers critical insights into the efficacy and application of green and low&#8208;carbon development. This study utilizes a staggered difference&#8208;in&#8208;differences model to examine the impact of green industrial park pilot policies. The results demonstrate that green industrial parks have effectively reduced carbon emissions of the studied counties in terms of total and intensity. The economic scales and the administrative levels of any given city significantly influence the implementation effect of green industrial park policy. In applying the green industrial park policy, reducing the carbon emissions is more pronounced in cities with larger economic scales and higher administrative levels. Environmental regulation policies and green industrial park pilot policies exhibit a certain degree of substitution effect. The green industrial parks drive urban carbon emission reduction through three main channels: enhancing green technologies, optimizing industrial structures, and elevating economic agglomeration levels. Overall, this study provides a new perspective, a methodological reference, and empirical evidence for promoting green and low&#8208;carbon development for industrial parks in the different regions and developing countries.</description>

However, whether and how industrial competitiveness affects carbon emission intensity (CEI) remains unclear. We develop the Environmental Kuznets Curve model (EKC) which introduces the characteristics of carbon dioxide and industrial life cycle. Additionally, we empirically investigate the impact mechanism of industrial competitiveness on CEI based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2008 to 2019. The results show that: (1) Improving industrial competitiveness can significantly reduce CEI, in which outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) has a partial mediating role. (2) regional heterogeneities exist in the carbon mitigating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif"&gt;&lt;span style="layout-grid-mode:line"&gt; effect of the industrial competitiveness, as it is larger and significant in the Northeast and West, but it is not significant in the East and Central. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif"&gt;(3) &lt;span style="layout-grid-mode:line"&gt;The demarcation point between the investment-driven stage and the innovation-driven stage is -0.6993, and the demarcation point between the innovation-driven stage and the wealth-driven stage is -0.2776. &lt;/span&gt;(4) &lt;span style="layout-grid-mode:line"&gt;The carbon reduction effect of the industrial competitiveness is larger and significant in the investment-driven stage and the innovation-driven stage, but it is not significant in the wealth-driven stage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span lang="EN-US" style="font-size:12.0pt"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family:&amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif"&gt;&lt;span style="layout-grid-mode:line"&gt; Accordingly, for countries in the world, improving industrial competitiveness and then realizing industrial upgrading is an effective way to reduce carbon emission intensity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                Abstract Erlenmeyer shake flasks are widely used during the first steps of bioprocess development. Despite their broad application in academia and industry, shake flasks usually lack standardized and user&#8208;friendly online monitoring techniques. In this work, the pH and Respiratory Activity MOnitoring System (pH&#8208;RAMOS) for the non&#8208;invasive online measurement of the oxygen transfer rate (OTR), carbon dioxide transfer rate (CTR), and pH in up to eight parallel shake flasks under sterile conditions is presented. The OTR and CTR are quasi&#8208;continuously measured in the headspace of the shake flasks using dedicated oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors, enabling precise respiratory quotient (RQ) evaluation. Self&#8208;adhesive pH sensor spots are used for the high&#8208;frequent real&#8208;time pH monitoring of the culture. These prototype pH sensor spots stand out due to their simple sterilizability and subsequent one&#8208;point calibration in the cultivation medium. The long&#8208;term stability of the pH sensor spots was assessed in a 28&#8208;day long abiotic experiment. The novel pH&#8208;RAMOS was validated with different eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as Ogataea polymorpha , Ustilago trichophora , and Vibrio natriegens . The combination of online OTR, CTR, RQ, and pH signals allowed for identifying various metabolic phenomena, such as oxygen limitations, substrate limitations, diauxies, and the production or consumption of specific compounds, based on their degree of reduction or change of pH. The high&#8208;frequent and sensitive pH&#8208;monitoring was particularly advantageous for registering subtle and transient metabolic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Metagenomic analysis of compositions and metabolic potential of microbial communities in production water from CO2-and water- flooded petroleum reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26789/aeb.2024.02.006</link>
      <description>Lei Zhou, Gui-Na Qi, Yi-Fan Liu, Jin&#8208;Feng Liu, Shi&#8208;Zhong Yang, Ji&#8208;Dong Gu, Bo&#8208;Zhong Mu, Applied Environmental Biotechnology. 9(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405335938

                CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) is one of the common and effective ways for carbon capture, utilization and storage(CCUS) in China. The injection of CO2 into petroleum reservoirs may influence subsurface environments and further affect microorganisms in oil reservoirs. However, the current knowledge about the impact of CO2 flooding operation on microbial communities and their metabolic functions in oil reservoirs is still limited. In this study, the compositions and metabolic potential of microbial communities in production water from CO2-and water-flooded oil reservoirs in Jilin oilfield were investigated by using a metagenomic approach. Comparative analyses indicated that the microbial community compositions in CO2-flooded oil reservoir samples (GQ43 and GH46) were significantly different from those in water-flooded ones (WQ21 and WH71), with lower microbial diversity. The difference analysis (p&lt;0.05) showed that Pseudomonas, Stutzerimonas, Marinobacterium,Pseudomonadaceae, Methanosarcina and Archaeoglobus were dominant in the former, while Azonexus, Sulfurospirillum, Candidatus Woesearchaeota, Candidatus Methanofastidiosa and Nanoarchaeota predominated in the latter. According to the high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) obtained, some members identified in the CO2-flooded oil reservoir samples might be involved in aerobic alkane biodegradation (Stutzerimonas and Hyphomonas), activated hydrocarbon utilization (Archaeoglobus and Magnetospirillum), fatty acid degradation (Stutzerimonas and Halomonas), fermentative metabolism (Stutzerimonas, Acidaminobacter, Fusibacter, Magnetospirillum, Shewanella, Halodesulfovibrio, Pseudodesulfovibrio and Halomonas), carbon fixation (Methanosarcina and Halodesulfovibrio)and syntrophic methanogenesis (Methanosarcina), simultaneously accompanied by dissimilatory sulfate reduction, thiosulfate reduction and denitrification. Whereas, a series of MAGs recovered from the water-flooded oil reservoir samples might be responsible for fumarate addition of aromatic hydrocarbons, activated hydrocarbon utilization, acetogenesis, reductive citrate cycle, dissimilatory nitrate reduction and sulfur metabolism (dissimilatory sulfate reduction, thiosulfate reduction and sulfur oxidation). These results contribute a broad and deep understanding of microbial communities and their roles in petroleum reservoirs especially affected by CO2 flooding operation, and provide the basic biological information for CCUS.</description>

                Carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases cause the atmosphere to get warmer. The ocean absorbs most of the heat and much of the CO2. This raises the temperature of the water, which can cause glaciers and ice sheets to melt, sea level to rise, coral reefs to bleach, fish to migrate to colder waters, and sea turtle sex ratio become skewed toward females. The CO2 added to the water causes its pH to get lower, or more acidic, which has its own negative effects on marine biota, especially shell formation in mollusks. These changes can have drastic economic effects as well as environmental ones. Reductions in fossil fuel use are essential to combat this global problem.</description>

      <title>Enhancing environmental conservation through guided tour buses: Insights from Taijiang National Park</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2305/cdco4840</link>
      <description>Wei-Chia Su, PARKS. 30(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405315117

                High visitor numbers in protected areas can create traffic problems that impact on the environmental protection. In Taijiang National Park, a tour bus project 'Taijiang Fun Tour' was introduced to mitigate various environmental problems caused by private cars. This study evaluates the project's environmental benefits, and those of the various bus routes in the park, in reducing CO2 emissions. The Mangrove route only achieved a CO2 reduction in 2023, likely due to post-COVID-19 tourism recovery. In contrast, the Black-faced Spoonbill route consistently showed reductions in CO2 emissions, attributed to higher per trip passenger numbers replacing more private cars, better road conditions, and longer distances between attractions, that enabled higher bus speeds and lower CO2 emissions per unit time. While it is unsurprising that CO2 reduction is significantly influenced by passenger numbers and bus speeds, the results of this study could be used by TJNP to enhance the benefits from bus use. Starting in 2024, TJNP will optimise routes and implement additional measures to encourage low-carbon transportation.</description>

                Abstract Photoelectrochemical (PEC) technology is one of the most promising methods for converting solar energy into valuable fuels and chemicals. Silicon (Si), a narrow band gap semiconductor with high carrier mobility, serves as a competitive material for photoelectrodes. This review outlines the research progress of Si&#8208;based photoanodes and photocathodes in diverse economically beneficial PEC redox reactions, extending beyond water splitting to include alcohol oxidation, carbon dioxide reduction, ammonia synthesis, organic degradation, and more. To address the key barriers to achieving efficient PEC conversion &#8211; such as slow charge carrier dynamics, sluggish reaction kinetics, and the instability of Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes &#8211; the mechanisms and implementation methods for fabricating efficient and stable Si&#8208;based photoelectrodes are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the challenges faced in advancing the commercialization of Si&#8208;based PEC solar energy conversion processes are explored.</description>

      <title>Exploring the carbon footprint of severe asthma and change after biologic therapy initiation: an analysis of Northern Irish data</title>

                Introduction The carbon footprint of severe asthma (SA) and the impact of biologic therapy in this population is unknown. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study in adults with SA, using data from the Northern Ireland Regional Severe Asthma Service (September 2015-November 2021). We calculated annual greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs; carbon dioxide equivalent) for asthma-related medications and healthcare resource utilisation, compared patient characteristics by GHG-quartile, calculated GHG change post-biologic initiation and explored the relationship between GHG change and clinical response. Results Among 303 patients with SA, mean GHGs was 474 kg ( sd :431), largely driven by SABA-use (50.7%) and ED/hospitalizations (21.0%). Those with highest-quartile GHGs were more likely to have uncontrolled disease (ACQ 3.5 versus 2.5; p&lt;0.001), be more deprived (46.1% versus 25.0%, p=0.029) and have depression/anxiety (35.5% versus 14.7%, p=0.002) versus those with lowest-quartile GHGs. Among patients who received a biologic (n=213), modest GHG reductions (&#8722;28.0 kg [ sd :286], p=0.15) were observed, largely driven by reduction in ED/hospitalization-related GHGs (&#8722;59.3 [ sd :224], p&lt;0.001). SABA-related GHG emissions were relatively unchanged (&#8722;6.1 kg [ sd :138]), p=0.518). Total GHGs were 72.4 kg ( sd :352, p=0.044) lower than baseline 4-years post-biologic-initiation. Although there was substantial clinical improvement post-biologic-initiation, this was not associated with GHG reductions. Conclusions SA is associated with substantial GHGs, primarily driven by SABA use and emergency care utilisation. Although GHG emissions were lower post-biologic, largely due to a reduction in emergency care, the changes in GHGs were modest and SABA-use was relatively unchanged. An improved understanding of the factors driving elevated GHGs is required.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Solid Formation under CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Liquefaction Conditions for Ship Transport at 7 and 16 Bar with Water Content up to 300 ppm</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.4c03556</link>
      <description>Asmira Delic, Xiaoyun Li, Stian Tr&#230;dal, Knut Arild Mar&#229;k, Thor Mejdell, Kai Hjarbo, David Berstad, Jacob Stang, Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405436775

                Ship-based transport of CO2 is crucial in developing a carbon capture and storage (CCS) infrastructure. Lowering the ship transport pressure of liquid CO2 from the conventional 14&#8211;18 to 7 bar increases the vessel-based transport capacity, leading to significant cost reductions. However, this reduction in pressure necessitates stringent water dew point control measures to prevent the formation of ice and CO2 hydrates, which could block pipelines and equipment. The capital and energy demands of complete dehydration of CO2 increase the CAPEX and the OPEX of the system. It is therefore important to know the limits for water content in the CO2 stream and the consequences if this system cannot reach the dehydration specification due to operational upsets. This study experimentally investigated possible solid formation under CO2 liquefaction for ship transport conditions at 16 and 7 bar, containing varying water concentrations. Using a CO2 stream from a postcombustion amine-based capture plant to represent a realistic CO2 composition, five tests were conducted at different liquefaction pressures and water contents. The experimental results were compared to the hydrate equilibrium predictions for pure CO2. It was found that, for low-pressure CO2 liquefaction with 200 ppm water, signs of solid formation started to occur at about 6.7 bar, which led to complete blocking of the filter over the course of approximately 1 h as the pressure was further reduced to 6.5 bar. This is clearly above the triple point pressure, so the solids that formed were most likely hydrates. For low-pressure CO2 liquefaction with 100 ppm of water operating very close to the triple point and the hydrate formation area, there was no increase in the pressure drop across the filter. For medium-pressure CO2 liquefaction at 16 bar, no indication of solid formation was observed with a water content of 200 and 300 ppm. These findings show the effects of exceeding the current water specification during liquefaction of low- and medium-pressure CO2 for ship transport.</description>

                Biochemical networks use reaction cascades to selectively reduce CO2 using energy from sunlight, but can similar selectivity be achieved by applying a cascade approach to an engineered system? Here, we report the design and implementation of a two-step photoelectrochemical (PEC) cascade to a liquid solar fuel: reduction of CO2 to CO and subsequent reduction of CO to methanol. The potentials required to perform the reductions were generated using custom-made III-V-based three-terminal tandem (3TT) solar cells. Cobalt phthalocyanine immobilized on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CoPc/MWCNT) catalyzed both reactions. Multiphysics simulations of electrolyte flow and non-illuminated electrochemical measurements were used to narrow the operating parameters for the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes. The champion integrated photocathode produced methanol with 3.8 &#177; 0.4% Faradaic efficiency (FE), with tested photocathodes having 0.7-3.8% methanol FE. Products were quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gas chromatography. The current output of the tested photocathodes was highly stable, and methanol production continued over multiple experiments. The low methanol yield is attributed to insufficient CO flux to, and CO2 depletion at, the methanol-producing subcell when both contacts are active, which is supported by the observation that a control photoelectrode slightly outperformed the methanol production of the 3TT device. Methanol production ceased when the 3TT subcell driving CO reduction was deactivated, supporting the assignment of a cascade mechanism. The major factors resulting in low methanol FE by the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathodes are insufficient CO2 depletion at the methanol-producing contact and uncertainty in operating potential selection using the 3TT design. Although the CoPc/MWCNT 3TT photocathode is not yet highly selective, this work develops the basic science principles underlying the PEC cascade, demonstrates the co-design of a 3TT-based photoelectrode to produce carbon-based fuels, and finally discusses routes for improving product yields with this concept, including CO2 supply optimization and alternative photoelectrode and catalyst materials.</description>

      <title>Promotional effect of Ti on mesoporous silica-supported Ru catalysts for CO2 methanation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-l2lht</link>

                Understanding the role of metal promoter in CO2 methanation is essential for advancing catalyst design and developing efficient methanation catalysts. Herein, a series of mesoporous Ti-promoted silica materials with different Ti-loadings was synthesized via the aerosol-assisted sol-gel process. These materials possess a spherical morphology with high specific surface area and homogeneous distribution of dispersed Ti species, even at Ti-loading as high as 16 mol%, thus allowing to investigate the role of Ti as a promoter in silica-supported Ru CO2 methanation catalysts. Keeping the Ru loading constant, higher Ti loadings (up to 12 mol%) lead to superior catalytic activity in CO2 methanation. At 300 C, the Ru-mass-normalized CO2 conversion rate of Ru/12%Ti-SiO2 catalyst is 2.3 times higher than that of unpromoted Ru/SiO2 catalyst. The improved activity correlates well with the smaller crystallite size of RuO2 nanoparticles, which translates to higher Ru dispersion after reductive treatment with H2. Overall, Ti helps stabilize Ru species and impedes crystal growth. With a Ti loading of 12 mol%, the crystallization of small anatase TiO2 is induced after RuO2 impregnation and during subsequent calcination, in turn forming the interfacial contact between Ru and TiO2 after H2 reduction. In-situ DRIFTS suggests that the promotion of CO2 activation and CO adsorption at these interfacial sites is responsible for the enhanced catalytic activity in Ti-promoted Ru-SiO2 methanation catalyst.</description>

                ABSTRACT For ensuring the economic feasibility of the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), which can be used to reduce the catalyst load and increase the catalytic activity of CO 2 RR by using carrier materials. Here, we report the systematic alteration of metal chloride on bipyridine groups in MOF&#8208;253(Al) using modified metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) as precursors and the introduction of Ag nanoparticles to prepare catalysts Ag@M&#8208;N/Al&#8208;O (M = Co, Ni, Zn, Cu). EDS spectra showed the uniform dispersion of Ag nanoparticles. In addition, the chemical structure of the catalyst was analyzed by XPS and PXRD, which proved the existence of M&#8208;N and Al&#8208;O bonds. The interaction with Ag nanoparticles leads to electron density reconstruction, and the stable *COOH intermediates with electron delocalization enhanced by polymetallic electron configuration modulation are conducive to CO production. The results show that Ag@Co&#8208;N/Al&#8208;O can achieve 85.6% FE for CO and has good stability within 12 h. This work provides a new idea for CO 2 RR material design using MOFs as a precursor catalyst.</description>

                Summary The CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) technique could increase the oil recovery factor and achieve subsurface CO2 storage. To evaluate the feasibility of CO2-EOR operation, an equation-of-state-based (EOS-based) compositional simulation is inevitable. However, time-consuming multiphase flash calculations limit the application of the conventional EOS-based compositional simulation in large-scale reservoir simulations. Therefore, there is an urgent need to accelerate the EOS-based compositional simulation by reducing the time spent on the multiphase flash calculations. In this study, we develop a fast, multiphase-state identification approach to achieve high computational efficiency of the compositional simulation. First, taking one given point in the compositional space composed by pressure and the overall composition as the original point, the phase-state radius (PSR) is defined as a radius inside which all points have the same phase state as the given point. Subsequently, the results of the multiphase flash calculations of the points in the compositional space are stored. Finally, when a new point is inside the PSR of one calculated point, the stored results are used to accelerate the new multiphase flash calculations of the new point by omitting the phase stability analysis (PSA) and possible additional multiphase split (MS) calculations. Case studies show a 6&#8211;10% reduction in multiphase flash computation time compared with two existing methods when the fluid is far from the phase boundary and a reduction of at least 17.5% when the fluid is near the phase boundary.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Irrigation Mist and CO2 vs. Direct CO2 Blower in On-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Anastomosis: Efficacy, Efficiency, and Fibrillation upon De-Clamping and Micro-Embolic Gas Activity Incidence</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/medicina60122035</link>
      <description>Ignazio Condello, Giuseppe Speziale, Flavio Fiore, Giuseppe Nasso, Medicina. 60(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405239100

                Background and Objectives: In coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on pump, achieving optimal visualization is critical for surgical precision and safety. The use of blowers to clear the CABG anastomosis poses risks, including the formation of micro-embolic gas bubbles, which can be insidious and increase the risk of cerebral or myocardial complications. This retrospective study compares the effectiveness of the use of irrigation mist and CO2 versus a direct CO2 blower without irrigation in terms of visualization, postoperative fibrillation, and micro-embolic gas activity. Materials and Methods: The study involved 40 patients who underwent on-pump CABG, with 20 patients assigned to the irrigation mist and CO2 group (ClearView&#8482;) and 20 to the direct CO2 blower group. Primary outcomes included the quality of intraoperative visualization, the incidence of fibrillation at aortic de-clamping, and the presence of micro-embolic gas activity detected via transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) in the cardiac chambers. Results: Patients in the irrigation mist and CO2 group experienced superior visualization and reduced tissue desiccation. Fibrillation at the time of aortic de-clamping occurred in two patients (10%) using the irrigation mist and CO2, compared to eight patients (40%) using the direct CO2 blower. Additionally, TEE monitoring revealed lower levels of micro-embolic gas activity in the irrigation mist and CO2 group, indicating a potential reduction in gas embolization risk. Conclusions: The irrigation mist and CO2 system not only provides enhanced visualization during CABG but also significantly reduces the incidence of fibrillation during aortic de-clamping and micro-embolic gas activity. These findings suggest improved patient safety and outcomes, highlighting the irrigation mist and CO2 system as a potentially safer alternative to direct CO2 blowing in the context of myocardial revascularization.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Influence of Activation Protocols on Cobalt Catalysts for Sustainable Fuel Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14120920</link>
      <description>Mohamed Amine Lwazzani, Andr&#233;s A. Garc&#237;a Blanco, Mart&#237; Biset&#8208;Peir&#243;, Elena Mart&#237;n Morales, Jordi Guilera, Catalysts. 14(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405366725

                The Fischer&#8211;Tropsch Synthesis process is projected to have a significant impact in the near future due to its potential for synthesizing sustainable fuels from biomass, carbon dioxide and organic wastes. In this catalytic process, catalyst activation plays a major role in the overall performance of Fischer&#8211;Tropsch Synthesis. Catalyst activation temperatures are considerably higher than the typical operating conditions of industrial reactors. Consequently, ex situ activation is often required for industrial Fischer&#8211;Tropsch Synthesis processes. This study evaluated the influence of different activation approaches (in situ, ex situ, passivation and low-temperature activation). Catalytic experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor at 230 &#176;C and 20 bar&#183;g using a reference supported Co/&#947;-Al2O3 catalyst. Experimental results demonstrate that catalysts can be effectively reduced ex situ. This work reveals that re-activation of the catalyst after ex situ reduction is unnecessary, as the reaction conditions themselves re-reduce any superficial oxides formed, owing to the reducing nature of the reactant mixture. This approach could simplify reactor design by enabling temperature requirements to match operating conditions (e.g., 230 &#176;C), thereby reducing both investment and operational costs and eliminating additional catalyst preparation steps.</description>

      <title>Coupling x-ray computed tomography and gray-level co-occurrence matrix to assess the evolution of microstructural damage in coal treated with supercritical CO2 fluid</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0246083</link>
      <description>Peng Luo, Zhenyu Zhang, Zihao Kan, Kangsheng Xue, Zhenjian Liu, Physics of Fluids. 36(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405280685

                The reliability of segmentation of x-ray computed tomography (CT) images based on user-selected thresholds is important for analyzing supercritical CO2 (ScCO2)-water-induced microstructural damage in coal. In this study, a novel approach is introduced by integrating the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) method with CT to analyze the evolution of microstructural damage in coal treated by ScCO2-water. The factors influencing GLCM calculation are also examined. GLCM heat maps and statistics were employed to visualize and quantitatively analyze the evolution of microstructural damage. The results show that the application of image grayscale registration and noise reduction to GLCM statistics did not produce directional bias, with noise reduction having a more significant impact. The pixel pairings depicted in GLCM heat maps provide insights into the spatial distribution of pore-fracture (in the low-density quadrant) and mineral components (in the high-density quadrant) within CT images, elucidating the evolution of micro-damage in coal samples. After the ScCO2-water treatment, a conspicuous rise in pixel pair counts within the low-density quadrant can be observed, accompanied by significant dissolution of the highest-density minerals, leading to a maximal reduction in pixel values within the high-density quadrant. Moreover, GLCM statistics show that the maximum damage location after ScCO2-water treatment does not completely match the initial coal. An accurate description of the evolution of GLCM statistics in the structural damage behavior induced by CO2 injection into deep coal-rock reservoirs is crucial, suggesting that these GLCM statistics have the potential to predict structural damage and reservoir instability during the geological sequestration of CO2.</description>

      <title>Novel artificial photosynthesis based carbon emission reduction technology with feasibility analysis of clean electricity generation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0241343</link>
      <description>Uttara Das, Champa Nandi, Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy. 16(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405442829

                Electricity generation leads to one third of greenhouse gas emissions in the world. Standing at the age of direct effect of global warming on global ecosystem, it is required to control global greenhouse gases within limit to avoid global climate alteration. For that, a new concept is proposed in this study for converting CO2 into glucose as well as generating power. Artificial photosynthesis concept is utilized here to design the glucose reactor. Artificial photosynthesis converts CO2 to glucose, integrating principles of carbon fixation, renewable energy, and electrochemistry for sustainable carbon utilization. Furthermore, the synthesized glucose is converted into power in an electrochemical way. A case study has been done based on wind power plant. Therefore, to execute the process, the system is powered by a wind power plant for cleaning the water molecules, CO2 molecule capture, which is synthesized into glucose. Then, the sensitivity analysis is carried out to find how the wind speed is affecting the production of glucose and power-regeneration. The result highlights that the designed system is capable of capturing total emitted CO2 from considered case study within few days. A single unit analysis of glucose reactor is given here. Moreover, the electrochemical system can produce power with that CO2-derived glucose. This concept will be surely benefited for carbon emission reduction, clean power generation, and sustainable development.</description>

                This paper presents a comprehensive holistic methodology implemented for sustainable lighting systems in educational institutions. The proposed methodology is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly with SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), and it follows international standards. The six-step process includes viability analysis, project design simulation using DIALux 4.13 software, the installation of LED lighting systems, and the redesign of some electrical circuits, followed by an analysis of return on investment and the monitorization of CO2 and energy consumption. The proposed methodology results in significant return on investment (ROI), primarily achieved through energy savings and reduced maintenance costs. The implementation of LED tubes, combined with occupancy and natural light sensors, leads to a 66% reduction in energy consumption and a reduction of 15.63 tons (metric tons) of CO2 annually, translating into a quick payback period of approximately 2.36 years. Additionally, the system includes Long-Term Monitoring, which ensures that energy consumption and lighting levels are continuously tracked.</description>

                Photochemical transformation represents an attractive pathway for the conversion of earth-abundant resources, such as H2O, CO2, O2, and N2, into valuable chemicals by utilizing sunlight as an energy source. Recently, two-dimensional conjugated metal-organic frameworks (2D c-MOFs) have emerged as the focal points in the field of photo-to-chemical conversion due to their advantages in light harvesting, electrical conductivity, mass transport, tunable electronic and porous structures, as well as abundant active sites. In this review, we highlight various physical and chemical features of 2D c-MOFs that can contribute to enhanced photo-induced exciton generation, charge transport, proton migration and redox catalysis. Then, the existing strategies to integrate suitable light absorbers and/or co-catalysts onto 2D c-MOFs for photochemical transformations (with a particular focus on H2 evolution, CO2 reduction and O2 reduction) have been discussed. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of using 2D c-MOFs in other photochemical applications (e.g., N2 fixation, organic synthesis, and environmental remediation) are assessed.</description>

      <title>Ligand-induced Changes in the Electrocatalytic Activity of Atomically Precise Au&#8322;&#8325; Nanoclusters</title>

                Atomically precise gold nanoclusters have shown great promise as model elctrocatalysts in pivotal electrocatalytic processes such as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Although the influence of ligands on the electronic properties of these nanoclusters are well acknowledged, the ligand effects on their electrocatalytic performances have been rarely explored. Herein, using [Au25(SR)18]- nanocluster as the prototype model, we demonstrated the importance of ligand hydrophilicity versus hydrophobicity in modulating the interface dynamics and electrocatalytic performance. Our first-principle computations revealed that Au25 protected by hydrophilic -SCH2COOH ligands dictates faster kinetics in stripping the thiolate ligand and exhibits better HER activity due to enhanced proton transfer facilitated by boosted interface hydrogen bonding. Conversely, Au25 protected by hydrophobic -SCH2CH3 ligands demonstrates enhanced CO2RR performance by minimizing water interference to stabilize the key *COOH intermediate and lower the barrier for CO formation. Experimental validation using synthesized [Au25(MPA)18]- (MPA=Mercaptopropionic acid) and [Au25(SC6H13)18]- confirms these findings, where [Au25(MPA)18]- exhibits better activity and stability in HER, while [Au25(SC6H13)18]- achieves higher Faradaic efficiency and current density in CO2RR. The mechanistic insights in this study provide valuable guidance for the rational design of surface microenvironment in efficient nanocatalysts for sustainable energy applications.</description>

      <title>Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of the Use of Coconut Biodiesel Blends and Neat Diesel in Public Utility Jeepneys in Metro Manila, The Philippines</title>

                This study aims to compare the CO2 emissions from conventional diesel and coconut biodiesel blends from raw material extraction up to use as fuel for public utility jeepneys (PUJs) in the Philippines. This work used the process-based LCA approach with 1 kilometer distance travelled by PUJs as the functional unit. The kg CO2 emissions from coconut farming and harvesting until the use phase of the coconut biodiesel blends in Metro Manila jeepneys were estimated in this work. The calculated emission factor of Coconut Methyl Ester (CME) from its fatty acid composition is 2.5539 kg CO2 per 1 kg CME. The total CO2 emissions in the life cycle of 2% CME blend (B2) and 5% CME blend (B5) were lower by 0.767% and 5.37%, respectively, compared to those from life cycle of neat diesel. In the life cycle of neat diesel, B2 blend, and B5 blend, the use phase contributed 75-78% of the CO2 emissions. The kg CO2 emissions from Metro Manila public utility jeepneys decreased from 0.400kg/ km using neat diesel to 0. 381 kg/km and 0.363 kg/km using B2 blend and B5 blend, respectively. In the life cycle of coconut biodiesel from raw material extraction to CME production, 52-58% of CO2 emissions come from the production of material inputs to the trans-esterification process. Three main recommendations are proposed by this work: (1) Extend the LCA to higher blend percentage. This entails measurement of specific fuel consumption of jeepneys using this fuel. (2) Increase engine efficiencies of Public Utility Jeepneys to reduce fuel consumption and realize higher CO2 emission reductions. (3) Further studies on optimization of mole ratio of methanol to coconut oil in trans-esterification process must be done. Explore use of methanol from sources-other than natural gas- with less CO2 emissions.</description>

                Purpose This study aims to explore how environmental investments impact the firm financial outcomes in emerging markets using a sample of 4,081 firms across 25 emerging countries from different regions from 2010&#8211;2022. Design/methodology/approach Fixed effect regressions with robust standard errors for unbalanced panel data are used to investigate the impact of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosure scores and carbon emissions intensity on firm profitability. The authors used simultaneous quantile regressions with bootstrapped standard errors to allow for estimating parameters of different quantiles of superior and inferior financial performers. Non-linear regressions are used to test for curvilinear relationships. Two-stage least squares regressions are used to mitigate concerns of endogeneity. Findings The results reveal that firms with less emissions of carbon dioxide report high profitability, however, firms with high ESG disclosure scores do not achieve superior performance. The authors detect a positive curvilinear U-shaped relationship and determine threshold level of ESG scores. Furthermore, firms with sustainable investments have more resilient performance during COVID-19 pandemic. Research limitations/implications A comprehensive analysis of the complex effect of environmental sustainability on financial performance in emerging markets uncovers the strategic motivations behind ESG disclosures and the thresholds where environmental performance translates into financial gains. Overall, this study emphasises the significance of sustainable investments in enhancing long-term profitability and resilience in emerging markets during turbulent times. Practical implications Proactive carbon emission reduction strategies are essential to safeguard firm competitive advantage. Firm ESG investments should be considered when forecasting firm value and stock price. There is a growing need for rigid policies to promote a green economy and mitigate climate change risks. Originality/value Offers a unique setting to examine the association between firm environmental and financial performance across emerging countries and regions. It explores the non-linear shape and magnitude of this relation across high-low quantiles of profitability. It sheds new light on the impact of sustainable practices on firm resilience during COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

                Abstract Sustainability is an imperative requirement in this era, with electrocatalytic power into fuels technologies emerging as a significant route toward sustainable chemistry. One of the focus areas within the chemical industry is capture of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and its electrochemical reduction (eCO 2 RR) into economically viable commodities through the utilization of renewable sources. Despite some specific eCO 2 RR technologies being poised for market introduction, the development of a comprehensive technology for eCO 2 RR remains a challenge. While certain technologies targeting specific eCO 2 RR products are on the verge of deployment, substantial efforts are still necessary to transition and establish presence in the market over conventional technologies. This review highlights recent technological advancements, fundamental studies, and the persisting challenges from an industrial perspective. We take a deep dive into the research methodologies, strategies, challenges, and advancements in the development of applications for eCO 2 RR. Specifically, three eCO 2 RR products &#8211; CO, HCOOH, and C 2 H 4 &#8211; as promising candidates for implementation are elaborated based on techno&#8208;economic considerations. Additionally, the review discusses the industrial blueprint for these products, aiming to streamline their path toward commercialization. The intent is to present the status of eCO 2 RR, offering insights into its potential transformation from a mere laboratory curiosity to a feasible technology for industrial chemical synthesis.</description>

                Oxygen-enriched combustion is increasingly recognized as a viable approach for clean energy production and carbon capture, offering substantial benefits for boosting combustion efficiency and mitigating pollutant emissions, which makes it widely adopted in various industrial applications. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), predominantly consisting of propane (C3H8), is commonly utilized in numerous combustion systems, yet its emissions of soot particulates have raised considerable environmental concerns. This study delves into the combustion dynamics and soot formation behavior of propane, the principal component of LPG, under oxy-fuel combustion conditions, with the inclusion of H2O and CO2, utilizing both experimental techniques and numerical simulations. The results reveal that CO2 and H2O suppress soot formation through distinct mechanisms. CO2 decreases soot nucleation and surface growth by lowering flame temperature and H atom concentration, but it minimally enhances soot oxidation. H2O significantly reduces soot formation by chemically increasing OH radical concentration, thereby enhancing soot oxidation. A detailed decoupling analysis further shows that CO2&#8217;s influence is predominantly thermal and chemical, resulting in lower OH levels and an elongated flame shape. In contrast, H2O&#8217;s substantial thermal and chemical effects decrease flame height and promote soot reduction. These insights advance the understanding of soot formation control in oxy-fuel combustion, offering strategies to optimize combustion efficiency and minimize environmental impact.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diesel Engine Performance and Emission Control Using Nanoparticles in Ethanol-Diesel Emulsions</title>

                This study analyses a C.I. engine's performance and emission characteristics using ethanol-diesel emulsions containing NiZnFe&#8322;O&#8324; nanoparticle nanoparticles. A four-stroke, single-cylinder, and diesel engine test rig was employed to evaluate different ethanol concentrations (5%, 10%, and 15%) and nanoparticle levels (25 ppm, 50 ppm, and 100 ppm) in the emulsions. The tests showed clear improvements in engine performance, fuel consumption, and emissions. The inclusion of NiZnFe&#8322;O&#8324; NPs in ethanol-diesel emulsions significantly lowered BSFC due to the nanoparticles acting as catalysts that enhanced combustion efficiency by increasing heat release and cylinder pressure. Without the nanoparticles, BSFC for ethanol blends increased by 27.17%, 34.39%, and 37.87% for the E5, E10, and E15 samples, respectively, compared to diesel. However, when nanoparticles were added, fuel consumption was greatly reduced. In terms of emissions, the nanoparticles effectively reduced hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke emissions. HC emissions dropped by 50%, 58%, and 71%, while smoke opacity fell by 59%, 69%, and 61% for the E103N25, E103N50, and E103N100 fuel samples, respectively. These reductions were linked to improved combustion, facilitated by better atomization and fuel-air mixing due to the nanoparticles. However, carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) emissions increased slightly due to more complete combustion. The findings suggest that graphite oxide nanoparticles could serve as a complementary or alternative Nano-catalyst in ethanol-diesel blends, further enhancing combustion efficiency and reducing emissions. This research underscores the potential of nanotechnology, including graphite oxide dosing, in creating cleaner, more efficient diesel engines with significant environmental and economic benefits.</description>

      <title>System for Quantifying Methane, Carbon Dioxide, and Hydrogen Sulfide Emissions in Low-Cost Digesters Inoculated with Horse Manure</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.18273/revion.v37n2-2024003</link>
      <description>Yudtanduly Acu&#241;a Monsalve, L. Rodr&#237;guez, D. Molina, Revista ION. 37(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405396083

                Methane CH&#8324; and carbon dioxide CO&#8322; are the primary gases produced during anaerobic digestion AD, followed by what is referred to as &#8220;other gases,&#8221; a highly variable group depending on the type of organic matter being digested. However, one of the most notable and common gases is hydrogen sulfide (H&#8322;S), a gas that, while not a greenhouse gas, is well-known for its corrosive effects and its impact on health and the environment [1]. To quantify gas emissions associated with the treatment of horse manure at the Cavalry Canton of the National Army of Colombia, a direct monitoring system was implemented. Over 45 days, measurements of CH&#8324;, CO&#8322;, and H&#8322;S were conducted using sensors such as the MQ-4, TGS 2611, SEN 0219, and MQ-136, respectively. The measurement ranges of the instruments used were: (200 &#8211; 10,000 ppm, 500 &#8211; 12,500 ppm, 0 &#8211; 5000 ppm, and 0 &#8211; 200 ppm), with detection levels of: (10 ppm, 0.1 &#8211; 0.65 ppm, 40 ppm, 30 ppm). These instruments were placed in three key scenarios: the manure storage site, the biodigester outlet, and under controlled laboratory conditions. The objective was to generate a detailed analysis of the behavior of these emissions. As a result, theoretical estimates of CH&#8324; and CO&#8322; equivalents were calculated for the Cavalry Canton. These theoretical estimates were compared with the data obtained from the monitoring and showed reductions ranging from 8 to 87 % for CH&#8324;, 58 to 67 % for CO&#8322;, and 33 to 65 % for H&#8322;S. These figures highlight the effectiveness of the implemented system in detecting gas emissions of interest from horse manure management, significantly contributing to environmental sustainability.</description>

      <title>Do Anti-Dumping Measures Count? The Emissions Adjustment in Sustainable Development Policies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/economies12120348</link>
      <description>Mihaela Onofrei, Bogdan F&#238;r&#355;escu, D. Cojocaru, Maria Grosu, Claudia Boghicevici, Economies. 12(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405463437

                Following the economic shocks of recent decades, characterized by the destabilization of markets and pressure on national economies, protectionist policies have seen a significant increase. Thus, anti-dumping has become a convenient and frequently used tool in the political game of trade. In the context of the transition toward a climate-neutral economy, anti-dumping measures have become a topic of great interest due to their indirect effects on CO2 emissions. Often used to protect domestic industries from unfair trade practices, these measures influence trade and the geographical redistribution of production, contributing to the phenomenon of &#8220;carbon leakage&#8221;. By transferring emissions from countries with strict climate regulations to economies with more permissive standards, anti-dumping measures can undermine global efforts to reduce emissions. Trade policies are becoming, in this context, an important tool in regulating international trade. Consequently, the objective of this paper is to analyze the impacts of anti-dumping measures, primary energy consumption, and urbanization on CO2 emissions in OECD countries for the period 2000&#8211;2021. The methodology used is based on dynamic A.R.D.L. models using panel data. Our results suggest that anti-dumping measures and primary energy consumption influence CO2 emissions and are statistically significant, at least at the 10% level. The results of this study are useful to both policymakers and environmental authorities in developing trade policies that support both economic development and emission-reduction targets.</description>

      <title>LITERATURE REVIEW ON CO-FIRING OF SUB BITUMINOUS COAL AND BIOMASS FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION MITIGATION</title>

                The overuse of fossil fuels has led to global warming and air pollution due to greenhouse gas emissions, particularly CO2. The toxic effects of coal combustion can be reduced by mixing coal with biomass, which is called the co-firing method. This study aims to analyze the use of co-firing using various types of biomass based on previous studies. The results show that different biomass blending ratios affect the emission reduction significantly. Mixing palm kernel shell biomass at a ratio of 10% biomass and 90% coal reduced emissions by 20%, while mixing mesua ferrea tree biomass and sawdust at a ratio of 75% coal and 25% biomass reduced emissions by 45%. The use of empty fruit bunch biomass at a ratio of 30% biomass and 70% coal can reduce CO2 emissions by 72.14%. Overall, co-firing proved effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and accelerating the transition to renewable energy, although its effectiveness depends on the type of biomass and the blending ratio.</description>

                Abstract. The CO2&#8211;carbonate system dynamics in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre (NASPG) were evaluated between 2009 and 2019. Data were collected aboard eight summer cruises through the Climate and Ocean: Variability, Predictability and Change (CLIVAR) 59.5&#176; N section. The ocean acidification (OA) patterns and the reduction in the saturation state of calcite (&#937;Ca) and aragonite (&#937;Arag) in response to the increasing anthropogenic CO2 (Cant) were assessed within the Irminger, Iceland, and Rockall basins during a poorly assessed decade in which the physical patterns reversed in comparison with previous well-known periods. The observed cooling, freshening, and enhanced ventilation increased the interannual rate of accumulation of Cant in the interior ocean by 50 %&#8211;86 % and the OA rates by close to 10 %. The OA trends were 0.0013&#8211;0.0032 units yr&#8722;1 in the Irminger and Iceland basins and 0.0006&#8211;0.0024 units yr&#8722;1 in the Rockall Trough, causing a decline in &#937;Ca and &#937;Arag of 0.004&#8211;0.021 and 0.003&#8211;0.0013 units yr&#8722;1, respectively. The Cant-driven rise in total inorganic carbon (CT) was the main driver of the OA (contributed by 53 %&#8211;68 % in upper layers and &gt; 82 % toward the interior ocean) and the reduction in &#937;Ca and &#937;Arag (&gt; 64 %). The transient decrease in temperature, salinity, and AT collectively counteracts the CT-driven acidification by 45 %&#8211;85 % in the upper layers and in the shallow Rockall Trough and by &lt; 10 % in the interior ocean. The present investigation reports the acceleration of the OA within the NASPG and expands knowledge about the future state of the ocean.</description>

                With the increasing need to tackle climate change, energy efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions are proving to be one of society&#8217;s greatest challenges. Special consideration should be given to heating systems as they are prone to inefficiency due to non-optimal controller configurations and the shortage of experts or qualified technicians to optimize the operating behavior. Especially for residential heating systems, more often than not, the target metric is the achievement of specific heating and hot water temperatures by manual adjustments with limited sensor information and with little regard to efficiency. This presents potential for computer-aided optimization based on artificial intelligence techniques. In this paper, we presented a Decision Integration System that is interfaced with a data acquisition infrastructure and allows for the analysis of measured heating system data, the generation of recommended measures for efficiency improvement, and the simulative validation of recommended controller parameter changes. We presented different parts of the Decision Integration System, the interfaced data acquisition infrastructure, as well as the non-invasive sensor appliances used. We analyzed the measured data of real heating systems and evaluated our approach by generating the recommended measures based on rules created by heating system experts, which were then partially applied to the physical heating systems and partially evaluated in simulation. Finally, we compared long-term energy consumption data against the latest monitoring period after implementing the measures. Our results showed an average reduction in energy consumption of 24.52% across all considered buildings, corresponding to an approximate reduction of 8.12 tons of CO2 emissions.</description>

      <title>Effects of Flow and Geomechanics Coupling in Faulted Reservoirs for CO2 Storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/220000-pa</link>

                Summary Accurately reproducing the coupling of fluid flow in porous media and rock mechanics is crucial for the modeling of CO2 geological storage to properly evaluate and prevent the risk of inducing fault instability during injection operations. As an alternative to using monolithic flow/mechanical suites, the process can be modeled by linking individual codes, that is i, a reservoir simulator for flow and a geomechanical package to account for fluid-induced stress change, which tackle the two problems sequentially. We developed a flexible numerical framework from which different coupling logics can be selected (i.e., one-way coupling, two-way iterative coupling, and two-way explicit coupling), which are characterized by different levels of accuracy and computational costs. A multirate, two-way coupling algorithm, which allows the flow and mechanical simulators to exchange information periodically rather than at every timestep, is also available to reduce the computational cost of two-way coupled simulations. In this work, we use this coupling infrastructure to perform numerical experiments aimed at defining whether sequential iterative coupling is strictly needed or not, and which less expensive logic can be used to attain a similar solution accuracy. First, a synthetic test case is used to illustrate the onset of fault instability during CO2 injection operations for different sets of coupling parameters (type and frequency), rock properties, and fault permeability. It is thus possible to evaluate, for a reasonable range of coupling strength, which depends on fluids and rock properties, the optimal level of coupling. Results are strongly influenced by the coupling strength, and two-way iterative coupling should be selected for tightly coupled systems to accurately reproduce the fault behavior. For a loosely coupled system, instead, the one-way approach should be the preferred choice due to its lower computational cost. Later, we consider CO2 injection into a realistic formation, and we analyze the impact of the coupling frequency on the computational performance. We show that, for complex cases, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the reduction in the number of coupling iterations and the reduction in computational time for increasing coupling period.</description>

In this thematic issue of Chemical Reviews, we present a collection of reviews on some of the key research topics related to the design of components and understanding of the elementary processes in current and emerging water-electrolysis technologies.Green hydrogen is produced through water electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, or hydropower, or possibly nuclear energy, resulting in low carbon emissions. (1) While the CO2 equivalent per kilogram of hydrogen produced (kgCO2e/kgH2) depends on many factors and requires a lifecycle analysis to assess, the U.S. Department of Energy's Section 45 V tax credit targets green hydrogen at below 0.45 kgCO2e/kgH2. (2) This requires minimizing emissions throughout the entire production process, including electricity use and upstream activities. These emissions are much lower than "gray" hydrogen from reforming natural gas (CH4 + 2H2O &#8594; CO2 + 4H2) with &#8764;10 kgCO2e/kgH2 and "blue" hydrogen using natural gas with carbon capture and &#8764;4 kgCO2e/kgH2. (3)Green hydrogen can dramatically reduce carbon-dioxide emissions associated with transportation and heavy industry. In transportation, hydrogen will be used where direct electrification is challenging, for example in aviation, shipping, and trucking. How the hydrogen is used will depend on the scale and cost of the (currently expensive) infrastructure to store and transport hydrogen. Pipelines are in principle cost-effective, but retrofitting existing natural-gas infrastructure is difficult (in part due to metals embrittlement discussed in this issue (4)). Hydrogen can also be combined with captured CO2 in efficient thermochemical processes to produce hydrocarbons, such as methanol or synthetic aviation fuels. (5) These renewable fuels can displace conventional fossil fuels without requiring major infrastructure changes, but CO2 capture (not discussed here) is an issue. (6) Hydrogen is also essential for the production and upgrading of biofuels, particularly synthetic fuels derived from renewable biomass. Substantial amounts of hydrogen&#9472;roughly 1/2H2 per carbon atom&#9472;in the resulting fuel are used to remove heteroatoms via hydro-deoxygenation, hydro-desulfurization, and hydro-denitrogenation processes. (7)Green hydrogen is likely to serve important roles in the future fully renewable electric grid that must deal with intermittent wind and solar generation on the daily, seasonal, and decadal time scales. (8,9) When energy storage is needed to fill gaps in production over multiple days, electricity generation from fuel cells and stored hydrogen become economically compelling, especially as the costs of fuel cells and electrolyzers continue to rapidly decline. (10)The ability of green hydrogen electrolyzers to serve as dispatchable load will also play a large role in enabling a reliable, expanded, and fully renewable electric grid. When renewable energy production is high or demand low, electrolyzers ramp up to productively use surplus electricity, and during peak demand, electrolyzers turn down or off. The hydrogen produced from these intermittent electrolyzers will be buffered in storage facilities and piped for industrial uses in fertilizer synthesis via Haber&#8211;Bosch chemistry and future green-steel and synthetic fuels industries. Fertilizer synthesis alone accounts for 2% of global CO2 emissions&#9472;most of which come from making the fossil hydrogen currently used (and thus readily displaced by green hydrogen). This also enables seasonal energy storage to ensure grid reliability and obviate the need for natural-gas peaker plants. Electric power markets will evolve to create profitable businesses around this range of grid services.Despite these advantages for green-hydrogen production, there remain many technical and scaling challenges. The U.S. DOE has established the Hydrogen Earthshot goal to reduce the cost of producing green hydrogen to $1 per kg by 2030, roughly an 80% reduction from the current &#8764;$5/kg. Storing and transporting hydrogen add more challenges that increase costs, as hydrogen gas has a low energy density compared to liquid hydrocarbons. Liquefaction of hydrogen requires energy-intensive processes. New infrastructure, including high-pressure tanks, possible cryogenic systems, and pipelines resistant to hydrogen embrittlement are needed. Transportation costs are historically expensive due to limited capacity, safety protocols, and energy losses from evaporation.There are a number of realistic pathways to reach the $1 per kg hydrogen target, bolstered by the science and technology innovation discussed in this thematic issue, coupled with reduced production costs with scaling. (11) A basic calculation is simple. The thermoneutral voltage for liquid water electrolysis is 1.48 V; below this voltage requires extra heat input. Faraday's law (and unit conversion) yields a minimum of 39.4 kW&#183;h per kg of hydrogen. A modern electrolyzer runs between 1.7 and 2.0 V, depending on current density, and there is additional electrical power associated with balance of plant. A practical high-performance electrolyzer thus requires &#8764;50 kW&#183;h per kg H2. Therefore, electricity is needed at $0.01&#8211;$0.015 per kW&#183;h so that the electricity cost is $0.50&#8211;$0.75 per kg H2.This need for extremely low-cost electrical energy has been used to argue that the cost target is not possible, particularly by entities involved in competing energy technologies. Yet the economics of the electric grid is changing. In 2024 there were a record number of hours with negative electricity prices in the European, Texas, and California markets where intermittent renewable generation has high penetration. While markets will adapt to limit negative electric prices, renewables will be overbuilt to provide capacity when rates are high&#9472;this necessarily leads to periods when rates are low. The fraction of time for which rates will average $0.01 per kW&#183;h is unknown but is likely to be substantial. A reasonable prediction is that electrolyzer systems can run with 30% capacity factor and access &#8764;$0.01 per kW&#183;h electricity, i.e. during the middle of the day and/or when there is high wind.While current electrolyzer prices from US and European manufacturers are too high to run at 30% capacity factor (&#8764;1000 $/kW combined price for alkaline stacks and balance of plant), (12) electrolyzer prices are dropping with manufacturing scale; similar, although a bit slower, to how battery and photovoltaic technologies have, (13) which both dropped &#8764;10&#215; since 2010. If we then assume a reasonable capital cost of $200 per kW by 2030, and a 20-year lifetime running at 30% capacity factor, the amortized cost is $0.19 per kg of H2. While there are additional maintenance, land, and financing costs, the sum of electric and equipment expenses can be below $1 per kg of hydrogen over a range of scenarios.The above simple analysis makes the case that the core needs for electrolysis are that next-generation technologies:(1)be relatively inexpensive and thus not use large amounts of precious metals (although low loadings may be acceptable),(2)have electrode, catalyst, and system designs that allow for intermittent operation without damage to the cell,(3)be able to operate with high efficiency given the high fraction of the cost electrical energy is to the output hydrogen, even at &#8764;$0.01 per kW&#183;h, and(4)must be durable for at least a decade or two under these conditions (recognizing that electrode/stack reconditioning may be much less expensive than building entirely new systems and enable operation for much longer).The contributions in this thematic issue of Chemical Reviews reflect the interdisciplinary nature of the science and engineering research needed to overcome the challenges associated with green hydrogen and reach the cost levels where hydrogen is able to dramatically reduce carbon dioxide emissions from large segments of the global economy.Several of the reviews deal with solid-oxide-based electrochemical technology. For example, Ming Chen's review provides analysis of solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), which offer the highest efficiency (&#8764;36 kWh/kg) among all technologies because they operate at temperatures near 800 &#176;C, where thermodynamics favor efficient water splitting and the electrode kinetics are fast. (14) The review covers advances in SOEC component design&#9472;from electrodes to electrolytes&#9472;and discusses strategies for mitigating performance degradation over time, which is a major issue today with this technology. Challenges, such as stack scalability, cost, and system durability, are addressed, with recommendations for future research focused on enhancing reliability and reducing capital costs. Eranda Nikolla's review focuses on solid-oxide cells (SOCs), particularly those that can switch between fuel-cell and electrolyzer modes. (15) SOCs are relevant in the context of green hydrogen because they can efficiently convert renewable electricity into hydrogen during times of surplus and generate power from hydrogen when energy demand peaks, both with much higher thermodynamic efficiency than possible in lower temperature (&lt;100 &#176;C) systems. The review highlights significant degradation of electrocatalytic materials under dynamic conditions, such as switching between modes or handling multiple fuel types, and identifies the bottlenecks in catalytic performance due to effects such as sintering, poisoning, and undergoing phase transitions, and provides guidelines for designing stable, efficient electrode catalysts.Other reviews discuss materials and processes for low temperature electrolysis systems that rely on liquid water and either alkaline or acidic electrolytes. Paul Kempler's review focuses on the role of gas bubbles generated during the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in electrolysis. (16) Gas evolution impacts the overall efficiency of electrolyzers by blocking active catalytic sites, increasing electrical resistance, and disrupting fluid dynamics at the electrode surface. The review discusses techniques for characterizing gas evolution in real time and optimizing electrode designs to enhance gas removal at high current densities. Effective bubble management is particularly essential for liquid alkaline electrolysis technology that has been historically limited to lower current densities (&lt;0.5 A cm&#8211;2) and constant current operation, but where innovation could enable dynamic operation and higher currents (&#8764;1&#8211;2 A cm&#8211;2) at high efficiency. The review identifies key strategies, such as tailoring electrode surfaces and structure to promote gas transport and bubble detachment. Managing gas evolution directly impacts the operational efficiency of electrolyzers, particularly at the high currents needed to reduce capital expense.Dirk Henkensmeier's review focuses on another key component for alkaline water electrolysis&#9472;the separator and/or membrane between the anode and cathode. (17) The review traces the historical evolution from asbestos-based diaphragms to polymeric composite diaphragms and the possibility to employ anion exchange membranes (AEMs), which offer improved conductivity and safety but are not yet fully proven stable for commercial application. Challenges in balancing the trade-offs between conductivity, membrane lifetime, and operational costs are discussed highlighting recent developments in ion-solvating membranes and improvements in AEM durability in strong hot alkaline solutions through chemical structure design. Thinner separators with lower ionic resistance that can effectively separate the evolved hydrogen and oxygen under varying load are central to lower the capital cost of the liquid alkaline electrolysis through higher current density while maintaining high efficiency.Travis Jones's review provides a detailed review of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts and their fundamental mechanisms, focusing on the challenges involved in understanding and modeling multiple electron transfers and bond-forming/breaking steps. (18) The review traces the evolution of OER models, from early phenomenological approaches to modern ab initio simulations that incorporate electric fields, solvent effects, and explicit reaction kinetics. Jones explores how these models compare with experiment and identifies areas where key work is needed to bridge theory and practice. Because the OER is one of the major sources of inefficiency in low-temperature water-electrolysis technology, these understandings are central to designing electrodes with better activity and durability without resorting to high mass loading of expensive precious metals (in the case of proton-exchange membrane, PEM, electrolysis technology).Laurie King's review addresses an important challenge facing PEM electrolysis technology, the use of precious metals. (19) PEM electrolyzers offer perhaps the most-compelling performance metrics, but remain more expensive. Emerging alkaline membrane electrolyzer systems also tend to use precious metal cathodes. (20) The review highlights alternative catalyst materials, including molybdenum disulfides (MoS2), nickel&#8211;molybdenum alloys, phosphides, and carbides, with a focus on their stability and performance in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes, reducing dependence on expensive precious metals, such as platinum, used in hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts. King also evaluates metrics for measuring HER activity and stability, offering insights into best practices for catalyst testing under real-world conditions.Jeffrey Dick's review focuses on single-entity electrocatalysis, an emerging field that investigates the catalytic behavior of individual nanoparticles, atomic structures, or molecules. (21) Traditional studies measure the performance of catalysts as ensembles, where the activity of many particles is averaged. Dick's review highlights the experimental challenges of studying single entities, such as the development of new measurement tools and techniques capable of probing individual particles in real-time. Case studies discussed in the review include hydrogen evolution, carbon-dioxide reduction, and hydrazine oxidation, each demonstrating how single-entity studies can uncover new insights into catalyst behavior that ensemble measurements cannot capture. This approach is useful in future catalyst design and targeted improvements in the catalyst nanopowders and nanostructures used in electrolyzer electrodes.Returning to foundational understanding, Yuanyue Liu's review explores the potential of atomistic modeling to accelerate the discovery of high-performance catalysts for green hydrogen production. (22) This review focuses on addressing the complexity of electrochemical interfaces, which involve interactions between dynamic catalysts, electrolyte ions, solvent molecules and electrode surfaces. Liu discusses techniques to model solvation effects, electrode potentials, reaction kinetics, and pH. The review also highlights computational spectroscopy methods, which can bridge the gap between theory and experiment by offering molecular-level insights into mechanisms.Aliaksandr Bandarenka's review provides an in-depth review of the electrical double layer (EDL)&#9472;the critical region of molecular dimensions that forms at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte, where ions accumulate, large electric fields exist, and solvent and other molecular species have properties very different than those of their bulk counterparts. (23) The review explores experimental techniques and theoretical models used to assess double-layer capacitance and ion interactions at electrochemical interfaces. Bandarenka emphasizes the influence of electrode composition, electrolyte chemistry, temperature, and pressure on EDL behavior, providing insights for optimizing catalysts and improving the efficiency and durability of electrochemical systems.Finally, Haiyang Yu and Zhiliang Zhang's review addresses perhaps one of the most critical issues for green hydrogen systems: hydrogen embrittlement, a phenomenon in which hydrogen atoms penetrate metallic structures, degrading their mechanical strength and causing cracks or fractures under stress. (4) This degradation is particularly dangerous for pipelines, tanks, and equipment used in hydrogen transport, storage, and processing. With green hydrogen production expected to scale rapidly, hydrogen embrittlement poses a significant threat to infrastructure reliability and safety particularly for any repurposed infrastructure from the natural gas industry. The review discusses how hydrogen interacts with different metals&#9472;steels, nickel alloys, and aluminum alloys&#9472;commonly used in energy infrastructure. Yu and Zhang explore the behavior of high-entropy alloys, the use of additive manufacturing to produce materials resistant to embrittlement, and the need for AI-driven predictive models to assess material performance and forecast failures. Reliable and predictable materials are central to hydrogen pipelines and storage facilities deployment at scale.The reviews presented in this thematic issue of Chemical Reviews collectively address some of the key science and engineering challenges associated with green-hydrogen production. From fundamental research on catalysts and materials to applied studies on electrolysis systems and gas-evolution, these contributions reflect some, but certainly not all, of the breadth of innovation required to realize the potential of green hydrogen. With work, green hydrogen is poised to be a cornerstone in the global energy transition.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorShannon W.

(John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.) A review. Hydrogen is often viewed as an important energy carrier in a future decarbonized world. Currently, most hydrogen is produced by steam reforming of methane in natural gas ("gray hydrogen"), with high carbon dioxide emissions. Increasingly, many propose using carbon capture and storage to reduce these emissions, producing so-called "blue hydrogen," frequently promoted as low emissions. We undertake the first effort in a peer-reviewed paper to examine the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of blue hydrogen accounting for emissions of both carbon dioxide and unburned fugitive methane. Far from being low carbon, greenhouse gas emissions from the prodn. of blue hydrogen are quite high, particularly due to the release of fugitive methane. For our default assumptions (3.5% emission rate of methane from natural gas and a 20-yr global warming potential), total carbon dioxide equiv. emissions for blue hydrogen are only 9%-12% less than for gray hydrogen. While carbon dioxide emissions are lower, fugitive methane emissions for blue hydrogen are higher than for gray hydrogen because of an increased use of natural gas to power the carbon capture. Perhaps surprisingly, the greenhouse gas footprint of blue hydrogen is more than 20% greater than burning natural gas or coal for heat and some 60% greater than burning diesel oil for heat, again with our default assumptions. In a sensitivity anal. in which the methane emission rate from natural gas is reduced to a low value of 1.54%, greenhouse gas emissions from blue hydrogen are still greater than from simply burning natural gas, and are only 18%-25% less than for gray hydrogen. Our anal. assumes that captured carbon dioxide can be stored indefinitely, an optimistic and unproven assumption. Even if true though, the use of blue hydrogen appears difficult to justify on climate grounds. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3MXhslKltrzL&amp;md5=a039b5ef4489e2eba5c08725ea4802074Yu, H.; D&#237;az, A.; Lu, X.; Sun, B.; Ding, Y.; Koyama, M.; He, J.; Zhou, X.; Oudriss, A.; Feaugas, X.; Zhang, Z.

(Cell Press) A review. The United States electricity grid is undergoing rapid changes in response to the sustained low price of natural gas, the falling cost of electricity from variable renewable resources (which are increasingly being paired with Li-ion storage with durations up to &#8764;4 h at rated power), and state and local decarbonization policies. Such a duration range lies between daily needs that can be satisfied with technologies with the cost structure of lithium-ion batteries and seasonal storage utilizing chem. storage in underground reservoirs. The economics of long-duration storage applications are considered, including contributions for both energy time shift and capacity payments and are shown to differ from the cost structure of applications well served by lithium-ion batteries. In particular, the capital cost for the energy subsystem must be substantially reduced to &#8764;3 $/kWh (for a duration of &#8764;100 h), &#8764;7 $/kWh (for a duration of &#8764;50 h), or &#8764;40 $/kWh (for a duration of &#8764;10 h) on a fully installed basis. Recent developments in major technol. classes that may approach the targets of the long-duration electricity storage (LDES) cost framework, including electrochem., thermal, and mech., are briefly ed. This perspective, which illustrates the importance of low-cost and high-energy-d. storage media, motivates new concepts and approaches for how LDES systems could be economical and provide value to the electricity grid. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3cXnslemtbw%253D&amp;md5=7d8b498c5c80d2a97d401187faec698a9Tong, D.; Farnham, D.

                The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological responses of cocoa plants (Theobroma cacao L.) subjected to water stress under flooding in different periods. The study was conducted in a greenhouse at the Capixaba Institute for Research, Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (INCAPER), located in Linhares-Es. The cultivars used for Theobroma cacao L. were cocoa varieties CCN 51 and TSH 1188, the first being used as a scion and the second as a rootstock. The experiment was carried out with cocoa seedlings under stress in a flooded environment, arranged in buckets and submerged in water, under different time conditions. Readings were taken at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 days of flooding. Measurements of net CO2 assimilation, stomatal conductance, transpiration and water use efficiency were performed, all using IRGA. The treatment 2 days after flooding did not differ from the control treatment (without flooding), while in the treatment 4 DAA there was a reduction in the net CO2 assimilation content. Plants flooded for 8 days showed lenticel growth, showing an attempt to alleviate environmental conditions. There was no interference by flooding in the PI and PII photosystems; the photosynthetic apparatus remained stable.</description>

                ConspectusElectrochemistry has been used as a tool to drive chemical reactions for more than two centuries. With the help of an electrode and a power source, chemists are provided with a system whose potential can be precisely dialed in. The theoretically infinite redox range renders electrochemistry capable of oxidizing or reducing some of the most tenacious compounds. Indeed, electroreduction offers an alternative to generating highly active intermediates from electrophiles (e.g., halides, alkenes, etc.) in organic synthesis, which can be untouchable with traditional reduction methods. Meanwhile, the reductive coupling reactions are extensively utilized in both industrial and academic settings due to their ability to swiftly, accurately, and effectively construct C&#8211;C and C&#8211;X bonds, which present innovative approaches for synthesizing complex molecules. Nonetheless, its application is constrained by several inherent limitations: (a) the requirement for stoichiometric quantities of reducing agents, (b) scarce activation strategies for inert substrates with high reduction potentials, (c) incomplete mechanistic elucidation, and (d) challenges in the isolation of intermediates. The merging of electrochemistry and reductive coupling represents an attractive approach to address the above limitations in organic synthesis and has seen increasing use in the synthetic community over the past few years.Since 2020, our group has been dedicated to developing electroreductive cross-coupling reactions using readily available organic substrates with small molecules, such as organic halides, alkenes, arenes, CO2, and D2O, to construct high value-added organic products. Electroreductive chemistry is highly versatile and offers powerful reducing capacity and precise selectivity control, which has allowed us to develop three electrochemical modes in our lab: (1) An economically advantageous electrochemical direct reduction (EDR) strategy that emphasizes efficiency, achieves high atom utilization, and minimizes unnecessary atomic waste. (2) A class of electrochemical organo-mediated reduction (EOMR) methods that are capable of effectively controlling reaction intermediates and reaction pathways. This allows for precise modulation of reaction processes to enhance efficiency and selectivity. (3) The electrochemical metal-catalyzed reduction (EMCR) method that enables selective activation and functionalization of specific chemical bonds or functional groups under mild conditions, thereby reducing the occurrence of side reactions. We commenced our studies by establishing an organic-mediator-promoted electroreductive carboxylation of aryl and alkyl halides. This strategy was then employed for the arylcarboxylation of simple styrenes with aryl halides in a highly selective manner. Meanwhile, under direct electrolysis conditions, the carboxylation of arenes and epoxides with CO2 as the carboxyl source was achieved. Moreover, through the precise adjustment of the electroreductive conditions, we successfully accomplished the electroreductive deuteration of arenes, olefins, and unactivated alkyl halides, enabling the efficient and selective formation of D-labeled products. Finally, building on our previous understanding of alkyl halides, we developed a series of electrochemical alkylation reactions that enable the efficient formation of C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp3) bonds using alkyl halides.</description>

                Abstract Electrocatalytic urea synthesis from CO2 and nitrate holds immense promise as a sustainable strategy, but its complicated synthesis steps and controversial C&#8211;N coupling mechanism restrict the design of efficient catalysts. Atomically precise metal cluster materials are ideal model catalysts for investigating the C&#8211;N coupling issues. Here we synthesize two atomically precise bimetallic clusters, Ag14Pd(PTFE)6(TPP)8 and Ag13Au5(PTFE)10(DPPP)4, both with icosahedral cores and similar ligands. We demonstrate that both clusters have good performance for electrocatalytic urea synthesis, with the production rates at the maximum Faradaic efficiency being 143.3 and 82.3 mg h&#8722;1 gcat&#8722;1, respectively. Bimetallic structures can induce charge polarization at the active sites of metal clusters, thereby influencing the selectivity. In mechanistic investigations, we propose that *NOH and *COOH are the rate-limiting steps for the reduction of nitrate and CO2, respectively, and that the key intermediates formed thereafter can significantly affect the C&#8211;N coupling process. This approach offers a deep understanding into the C&#8211;N coupling through the utilization of atomically precise metal clusters.</description>

      <title>Multispectral Imaging and OCT-Guided Precision Treatment of Rhinophyma with CO2 and Dye Lasers: A Comprehensive Diagnostic and Therapeutic Approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/cosmetics11060221</link>
      <description>S. Amato, Steven Paul Nistic&#242;, Alessandro Clementi, Giorgio Stabile, Fortunato Cassalia, Annunziata Dattola, Giuseppe Rizzuto, Giovanni Cannarozzo, Cosmetics. 11(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405371770

                Background/Objectives: Rhinophyma, an advanced form of rosacea, is characterized by significant nasal tissue enlargement and deformation, leading to aesthetic and psychosocial challenges. Traditional treatments are often invasive with variable outcomes, emphasizing the need for improved therapeutic approaches. This study evaluates the efficacy of a dual-laser therapy (CO2 and dye lasers) in treating rhinophyma. An innovative diagnostic algorithm using multispectral imaging guided treatment decisions, while Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) was utilized to analyze post-treatment vascular and collagen changes. Methods: A prospective study was conducted involving 20 patients with rhinophyma. Multispectral imaging was used to guide the tailored application of CO2 laser, dye laser, or both, depending on the predominant vascular or glandular components in the nasal tissue. Post-treatment analysis employed OCT to assess changes in vascular and collagen density, providing insights into the tissue modifications induced by laser therapy. Results: The treatment significantly reduced vascular density from 35,526.75 to 26,577.55 at 300 microns and from 46,916.25 to 35,509.25 at 500 microns. Collagen density decreased from 81.35 to 66.34. All reductions were statistically significant, with highly significant p-values. These findings highlight the dual-laser therapy&#8217;s effectiveness in addressing the pathological features of rhinophyma. Conclusions: Dual-laser therapy guided by multispectral imaging provides a targeted and effective treatment for rhinophyma, addressing its vascular and glandular components. The use of OCT enhances understanding of laser-induced tissue changes and confirms significant reductions in vascular and collagen density. This approach represents a significant advancement in the management of rhinophyma, offering improved precision and therapeutic outcomes.</description>

                The Cover Feature shows graphene nanoplatelets (Gnp) as catalyst support for Ni or Ru and their use in CO2 hydrogenation. The prepared heterogeneous catalyst is deeply characterized by assessing catalytic performances, quantifying particle size and sulfur content, and evaluating carbon loss during catalyst pre-reduction. The Ru-based catalyst shows almost complete selectivity towards the reverse water gas shift reaction (rWGS), while the Ni-based catalyst also produces methane (methanation). More information can be found in the Research Article by G. Garbarino and co-workers. Cover design and realization: Renza Merlo Belviso and Gabriella Garbarino.</description>

                Polydispersed Ag species-modified TiO2 samples with abundant oxygen vacancies were successfully prepared through the calcination of atomically precise Ag33 nanocluster-loaded TiO2 at an optimal temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. The ligands of the Ag33 nanoclusters are removed by extracting lattice oxygen from TiO2 during the calcination, leading to the formation of CO2, SO2, and H2O vapor. This process simultaneously induces Ag species sintering on the surface of TiO2. The resulting nanocomposites exhibited excellent catalytic activity for the reduction of nitroarenes with NaBH4 as the reductant. This is attributed to the produced Ag species on the oxygen-deficient TiO2, which act as active centers for the catalytic process.</description>

      <title>Thermal Performance, Indoor Air Quality, and Carbon Footprint Assessment in Airport Terminal Buildings</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14123957</link>
      <description>Mehmet Kadri Aky&#252;z, Emin A&#231;&#305;kkalp, &#214;nder Altunta&#351;, Buildings. 14(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405320157

                This study explores energy consumption, thermal performance, and indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in terminal buildings. Through detailed thermal analysis, this research identifies key sources of heat loss, such as thermal bridges in walls and windows, which significantly increase energy demands for heating. IEQ measurements show that the lack of mechanical ventilation, combined with high passenger densities, frequently leads to CO2 levels exceeding recommended thresholds, highlighting the urgent need for improved ventilation systems. Energy requirements were calculated based on the TS 825 standard and compared to actual consumption data, showing that optimizing boiler settings could save 22% of heating energy without any additional investment. Simulations and economic analyses further showed that adding thermal insulation to the building envelope and installing double-glazed windows with improved U-values could achieve significant energy savings and reduce CO2 emissions, all with favorable payback periods. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to evaluate the environmental impact of these interventions, demonstrating significant reductions in the airport&#8217;s carbon footprint. The findings underscore the importance of aligning operational standards with international guidelines, such as ASHRAE and CIBSE, to ensure thermal comfort and optimize energy use.</description>

      <title>Using agent-based modelling to simulate the emission reduction potential of CCUS technologies in China under alternative policy packages</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad9c9b</link>
      <description>Changgen Dong, Zhuoluo Sun, Jingjing Jiang, Yang Yang, Environmental Research Letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405222993

                Abstract Carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) technologies are essential for achieving the 1.5 &#176;C target. Predicting the emission reduction potential of CCUS technology is particularly important for countries to pursue carbon neutrality. However, the existing literature assessing the potential lacks consideration of the structural changes in industrial product demand and the trade-offs companies face between CCUS and traditional emission reduction technologies. This study used agent-based modelling (ABM) to simulate the emission reduction potential of CCUS in China's thermal power, steel, cement, and chemical industries from 2022 to 2060 under scenarios of different carbon prices, subsidies, and technology progress rates. The possible biases of the traditional prediction model were corrected incorporating the structural changes in industrial product demand and the marginal abatement cost curves of traditional emission reduction technologies for the four major industries into the ABM model. The simulation results indicate that under each of the 10 possible scenarios, China's CCUS technologies will reach 100% penetration in the four mentioned industries by 2060, with the emission reduction potential fluctuating between 2,222 and 1,568 Mt of CO2 (corresponding to 40% and 10% share of thermal power, respectively). The difference comes in the scaled-up threshold time point and the growth trend. Sensitivity analyses show that the carbon price affects changes in the emission reduction potential of CCUS technologies the most, while the impact of subsidies, rates of technological progress and oil prices were not significant. The stepped carbon price policy can effectively regulate and promote the expansion of CCUS emission reduction potential, which is worth considering for policymakers.&amp;#xD;</description>

      <title>Comparison of Q-Switched Nd:YAG LASER with 10% Azelaic Acid versus Fractional CO2 LASER with 10% Azelaic Acid in the treatment of Post Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation secondary to Acne</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.70135/seejph.vi.2660</link>
      <description>Sumedha Tirthani, Rajashekar Talari Srinivas, Suresh Kumar K, K Hanumanthayya, V Venkatesh, M Chandrashekar, South Eastern European Journal of Public Health. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405446199

                Background:Post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) secondary to acne is a common undesirable sequela following acne that leads to psychological distress and a sense of incomplete treatment among the patients with acne. Few studies have been done in regard to address this condition, and no definite treatment or clear ranking of treatment modalities is available as of yet.Aims:The aim of our study was to assess and compare the efficacy and safety of 1,064-nm Q-switched neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (QSNY) laser with 10% azelaic acid versus Fractional carbon dioxide (FCO2) laser with 10% azelaic acid in the treatment of post acne pigmentation.Materials and Methods:Seventy patients with PIH secondary to acne were recruited in this study. The patients were randomized into two groups, Group A and Group B, of thirty-five patients each. Patients in group A underwent QSNY laser, while Group B received FCO2 laser. 10% azelaic acid cream was administered to both groups. Both groups received a total of 5 treatment sessions, with 3 weeks interval between each setting. The efficacy and safety of both modalities were assessed using the quartile grading score(QGS), post acne hyperpigmentationindex(PAHPI), patient satisfaction score, and documentation of adverse effects.Results:At the end of five sessions, significant improvement in QGS, PAHPI and patient satisfaction (P &lt; 0.001, respectively) was seen in both groups. The mean PAHPI significantly reduced after the third setting and was followed by drastic reduction in the following settings. However, significantly superior results were noted in Group A with respect to all assessments. Side effects noted were mild and transient, except two patients of Group B who developed further pigmentation over the treatment areas.Conclusion:This study shows that both QSNY laser and FCO2 laser can be used to treat post-acne pigmentation; however, QSNY laser should be preferred with respect to efficacy and safety, especially in the Indian population, owing to the higher risk of pigmentation following FCO2 laser.</description>

                The paper presents aspects related the influence of the global gases emissions reduction targets on the design and performances of a propulsion system for a bulk carrier. In a first stage, the key elements of the ship propulsion system: main engine and propeller have been chosen and designed. The aim was to obtain the maximum propulsive efficiency at the owner desired speed. Different combinations: diesel engine-optimal propeller have been designed and analysed from the efficiency point of view. In a second stage, considering the mandatory IMO regulations concerning CO2 emissions, the EEDI (Energy Efficiency De sign Index) has been computed for every designed case. To compliance EEDI targets, it was been necessary to reduce the ship speed, and a new propulsion system with lower speed performances has been designed. In this study, ship hull shapes were given and EEDI be came an important and critical factor in the design of the ship propulsion system. Other potential pathways to achieve emissions reduction targets will need to be identify in a future study.</description>

                Background The literature doesn&#8217;t contain examples of patients with one lung who were treated with High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) after identifying hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure secondary to pneumonia. Discussion A 69 years-old male COPD associated, who had already a posttraumatic exeresis from an accident at work, went to the ER of our Hospital to severe dyspnea. At CT of thorax, an consolidation was found in the left basal region. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed severe hypercapnia and severe hypoxemia. The patient was admitted to the Emergency Medicine, where NIV + OLT was administered. We were contacted for a transfer. In our department, a bronchoscopy was performed, which documented the presence of dense secretions. A new antibiotic therapy was initiated and was placed on High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC). The decision to use HFNC was considered for better secretion management, for CO2 wash-out effect and humidified gas mixtures. During hospitalization, the patient adapted to this system, and a progressive improvement was observed. Results and Conclusion Follow-up 30- 90 days showed a significant reduction in blood CO2 levels. The chronic use of HFNC is still under study, we believe it could be a possible solution for patients with global chronic respiratory failure and stable COPD.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Local Metakaolin Powder for Application as Geopolymer Precursor for Concrete Binder</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.35629/5252-0612153163</link>

                It is known that metakaolin powder has proved to be a promising alternative concrete binder to Ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Portland cement production contributes about 8% to the global CO2 emission, which is detrimental to the environment and a major contributor to global warming. It is therefore pertinent to develop alternative costeffective and environmentally friendly cement materials. This study examines the performance of a Nigerian metakaolin-based powder as a sustainable material alternative to Portland cement. The Gwaram-Alkaleri Kaolin clay from Bauchi State, Nigeria, was calcined at 800&#176;C for 3 hours as step prior to metakaolin formation. The powder specimens were characterized using XRF, moisture content, specific gravity, density, particle size distribution analysis and specific surface area techniques. Parametric analyses of the values of the specific gravity, density, particle size distribution and specific surface area were undertaken and comparisons and deductions made. The results revealed that Gwaram-Alkaleri metakaolin-powder can serve as a potential sustainable construction material for the Nigerian construction industry because of its availability, affordability, physical and chemical properties values, and significant reduction in CO2 emission, taking cognizance that the results positively indicate that it can be used as an alternative binding powder to cement in concrete and mortar production.</description>

      <title>Research on the construction method of sample set in CO2 retrieval based on statistical analysis method</title>

                China's carbon reduction and emission reduction under the 'double carbon' target requires high-precision atmospheric CO2 inversion data. High-precision atmospheric CO2 satellite observation is the basis for accurate positioning of emission sources. Aiming at the problem that the inversion algorithm is difficult to converge in the existing inversion methods, a statistical method integrating multi-source information is explored to obtain accurate prior profiles. It provides relatively accurate initial values for subsequent high-precision CO2 inversion algorithms in order to improve the accuracy of CO2 inversion. The statistical inversion method establishes a regression relationship model between satellite spectrum and atmospheric CO2 concentration, and the inversion accuracy is affected by the representativeness of the sample and the regression analysis method. According to the difference of regional characteristics, the CO2 profile samples are counted, and the sensitivity of environmental parameters is analyzed to construct a representative sample set. It is verified that the profile obtained by inversion is very close to the real profile, which verifies the feasibility of the method.</description>

      <title>Potential Reductions in Carbon Emissions from Indonesian Forest Concessions Through Use of Reduced-Impact Logging Practices</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/f15122198</link>
      <description>Hermudananto Hermudananto, Ethan P. Belair, Hasbie Hasbillah, Peter W. Ellis, Ruslandi, Francis E. Putz, Forests. 15(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405377815

                To estimate the potential and realized carbon emission reductions from implementation of reduced-impact logging (RIL) in Indonesia, we compiled logging emissions data from 15 concessions in Kalimantan and 10 from the Papuan provinces. Committed emissions data were collected for harvested timber as well as from collateral damage caused by felling, skidding, and clearing for haul roads and log yards. Emissions expressed as mean &#177; standard error per cubic meter of timber harvested, per area harvested, and per Mg of timber harvested (i.e., the &#8216;Carbon Impact Factor&#8217;) were 1.30 &#177; 0.15 Mg C m&#8722;3, 27.52 &#177; 4.44 Mg C ha&#8722;1, and 6.88 &#177; 0.84 Mg Mg&#8722;1, respectively. Among the sampled concessions, felling, hauling, and skidding caused 18&#8211;86%, 2&#8211;48%, and 6&#8211;75% of these emissions, respectively. Potential emission reductions calculated as the difference between observed emissions and those of the five best-performing concessions are 0.67 &#177; 0.15 Mg C m&#8722;3, 21.11 &#177; 4.38 Mg C ha&#8722;1, and 4.20 &#177; 0.83 Mg Mg&#8722;1, which represents reductions of 51%, 76%, and 61%, respectively. Extrapolating these estimates to all of Indonesia using average log production data from 2018 to 2021 results in an estimated annual emissions reduction of 14.47 Tg CO2 from full adoption of RIL, which is 2.9% of Indonesia&#8217;s nationally determined contribution (NDC) from the forestry sector.</description>

      <title>Reliability analysis of submarine slopes in hydrate extraction by depressurization-assisted replacement</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1080/1064119x.2024.2437563</link>
      <description>Jitao Xu, Haitao Zhu, Mingjing Jiang, Wenhao Li, Marine Georesources and Geotechnology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405210495

                As an extension of CO2 replacement method, the depressurization-assisted replacement method can improve extraction efficiency. For these two methods, this paper takes the hole GMGS2-08 as a case study. By integrating infinite slope model and random field theory, this text analyses the impact of three factors on the slope safety, such as the strength differences from different hydrate types and saturations, the strength discounting due to the earthquake, and the seismic addition force. And, the impact degree of the three factors increases in sequence. In the non-stationary random field, this paper sets cohesion (c), friction angle (&#966;), unit weight (&#947;) and reduction coefficient (&#958;) as four random variables. There is found that the correlation between the c and &#966;, the cohesion variability, the friction angle variability, the reduction coefficient variability, the cohesion trendiness, the friction angle trendiness, and the unit weight trendiness have a more important impact on the failure probability (Pf) of submarine slops. When the Pf is about 65%, the safety factors with different slopes angles are around 1.05, despite the different effects of seismic forces and strength discounting. The combined analysis of safety factor and the Pf can offer excellent early warning for safe hydrate extraction.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Sustainability and Social Perceptions of Recycled PET BubbleDeck Slabs in Urban Development: A Case Study in Oman</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.61707/9v0jgp95</link>
      <description>Mariam Alnuaimi, Daud Bin Mohamed, International Journal of Religion. 5(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405350066

                This study investigates the adoption of recycled PET BubbleDeck slabs in Oman, focusing on sustainability, economic feasibility, social perceptions, and regulatory support. Using a questionnaire-based survey analysed through SPSS, the research explores key determinants, including carbon footprint reduction, material efficiency, life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA), public awareness, and policy frameworks, with stakeholder awareness mediating the relationships. Results demonstrate that BubbleDeck slabs reduce CO2 emissions by 33% and concrete usage by 25%, aligning with Oman Vision 2040&#8217;s emphasis on sustainable construction. However, high initial costs and limited public awareness hinder adoption. The study&#8217;s regression analysis highlights that sustainability metrics and regulatory support are significant predictors of adoption, with carbon footprint reduction and certifications playing critical roles. Economic feasibility, particularly LCCA, positively impacts adoption, while initial costs present barriers. Public awareness and trust in technology emerged as essential social factors driving acceptance. This research underscores the importance of policy-driven incentives, public education campaigns, and stakeholder collaboration in promoting innovative green technologies. The findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners to advance sustainable urban development and foster the widespread adoption of BubbleDeck technology in the construction sector.</description>

      <title>Energy Transition Planning in Achieving the Net Zero Emission 2060 Target in the Provincial Electricity Sector North Sumatra</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.58451/ijebss.v3i2.199</link>
      <description>Muhamad Iqbal Sutikno, Suhanan Suhanan, Ahmad Agus Setiawan, International Journal of Engineering Business and Social Science. 3(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405277797

                This research discusses the energy transition towards the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) 2060 target in the electricity sector of North Sumatra Province. The challenges faced include dependence on fossil fuels, high greenhouse gas emissions, and limited renewable energy capacity. The study aims to model energy transition scenarios, evaluate the optimal renewable energy mix, and determine emission reduction strategies in the electricity sector using LEAP-NEMO software. This study uses a forecasting-based simulation modeling method with a mathematical approach through LEAP software and NEMO optimization framework. Three scenarios were analyzed, namely Business As Usual (BAU), Net Zero Emissions Carbon Capture Storage (NZE CCS), and Net Zero Emissions Full Renewable Energy (NZE FRE). The simulation results show that the NZE FRE scenario is able to achieve a 100% renewable energy mix by 2060, outperforming the BAU (42.1%) and NZE CCS (70.8%) scenarios. Solar, biomass, hydro, and geothermal energy are the main sources of energy, with solar energy as the largest contributor. Greenhouse gas emissions are reduced by up to 265.9 million tons of CO2 (70.5%) compared to the BAU scenario. These findings provide policy recommendations that support the implementation of renewable energy, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and fiscal policies that internalize environmental costs. The study also highlights the importance of investing in clean energy technologies to realize a sustainable electricity system in Indonesia.</description>

      <title>Multi-Segment Variable Speed Predictive Control Strategy for Eliminating Traffic Bottlenecks in Emergency Cases on Super-Long-Span Bridges</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app142411644</link>
      <description>Jingwen Yang, Ping Wang, Applied Sciences. 14(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405377178

                In this paper, we investigate traffic bottlenecks, a primary cause of congestion that significantly impacts the overall efficiency of traffic networks. To address this challenge, a multi-segment variable speed limit control strategy is proposed to mitigate moving bottlenecks, particularly those on super-long-span bridges. First, an extended macro-traffic flow model, built upon the classic MetaNet framework, is proposed as a state-space model to capture the critical characteristics of long segments, which is a key contribution of this paper. Next, a fast prediction model is developed to forecast traffic flow states in lane-drop bottlenecks with restricted passing capacity over long road segments. Then, a controller leveraging the state-compensation flow model is designed to regulate the future evolution of bottleneck density. Finally, the multi-segment variable speed predictive control (MVSPC) strategy is validated on a simulation platform integrating PYTHON and SUMO, and its performance is compared with both traditional and advanced methods. The results demonstrate that under varying traffic flow levels, particularly in high-demand scenarios, the strategy achieves significant improvements in efficiency, safety, and environmental metrics. These include a 62.44% reduction in waiting time, a 95.32% decrease in potential collisions, and reductions in emissions: 26.4% in CO2, 14.11% in CO, 26.53% in NO, and 32.90% in NOX. The proposed strategy is particularly effective for long segments, such as super-long-span bridges.</description>

                Abstract This paper investigates a novel methodology for measuring greenhouse gas emissions by re-evaluating the packaging and transport systems of local communities at a time when concerns about environmental sustainability and the fight against climate change are increasingly heightened. The research first presents CO2 emissions data associated with each logistical sub-process and the methodology used to calculate the CO2 emissions associated with the products. Then, the analysis of a local community-owned asset exchange is presented. Based on the packaging size and weight of the items, calculations are made of the CO2 impact of transporting a product from different distances. The results are also analyzed by investigating the activity of the local community with four different modes of transport and then comparing the amount of CO2 emitted to the population of a city. The study demonstrates that freight transport operations are a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions and seeks to identify opportunities that could lead to significant carbon footprint reductions through community initiatives. The paper points out that even a local community exchange of goods could make a significant contribution to reducing global CO2 emissions. Therefore, in addition to measures to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, implementing a "Think globally, act locally" policy would contribute significantly to CO2 emissions reductions.</description>

                Recent advancements in reconstructive techniques for burn-induced skin defects have improved functional and aesthetic outcomes to enhance life quality of burn survivors. A wide range of innovative methods such as flap surgeries advancements or laser therapies and tissue expansion techniques are now available in the markets and their use has been widely explored for management of extensive post-burn scarring. According to studies the use of latest technological innovations and microvascular free tissue transfer, Z-plasty and trapeze flaps have excellent success rates for contracture release, scar reduction, and functional restoration. Laser treatments that have shown promise in decreasing scar thickness and increasing suppleness include stromal vascular fraction therapy and CO2 fractional lasers. There remain persisting issues like limited long-term data, expense, and technical complexity. In order to evaluate the clinical effectiveness, drawbacks, and potential future directions of these reconstructive techniques in burn care, this review summarizes recent research.</description>

      <title>Life Cycle Assessment of Crude Oil-Contaminated Soil Treated by Low-Temperature Thermal Desorption and Its Beneficial Reuse for Soil Amendment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su162410900</link>
      <description>Young Ho Song, Geon Yong Kim, Da Yeon Kim, Yong Woo Hwang, Sustainability. 16(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405321785

                The effectiveness of thermal treatment technologies for the remediation of soils contaminated with heavy hydrocarbons has been extensively documented in the scientific literature. In general, high-concentration crude-oil-contaminated soil is treated with high-temperature thermal desorption (HTTD) in order to achieve high remediation efficiency. However, this process has the unintended consequence of destroying soil fertility. Low-temperature thermal desorption (LTTD) represents an alternative approach that has been developed with the objective of remediating heavily crude-oil-contaminated soil in a more rapid and cost-effective manner while simultaneously enhancing soil fertility. The thermal desorption unit (TDU) was employed using both LTTD and HTTD, operating at 300 &#176;C and 500 &#176;C, respectively, with a 30 min residence time in the kiln. The concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) in both the LTTD- and HTTD-treated soils was found to be less than 1% by weight, thereby below regulatory standards. The environmental impacts of both processes were assessed using the OpenLCA software version 2.0. The HTTD process exhibited a total abiotic depletion potential (ADP) impact of 1.63 &#215; 10&#8722;4 MJ and a global warming potential (GWP) of 414 kg CO2-eq. In contrast, LTTD demonstrated lower impacts, with an ADP of 1.29 &#215; 10&#8722;4 MJ and a GWP of 278 kg CO2-eq. The transition from HTTD to LTTD resulted in a notable reduction in ADP by 20.5% and in GWP by 32.9%. The application of LTTD-treated soil coated with coke or carbonized residues has been demonstrated to serve as an effective soil amendment, with the capacity to sequester approximately 50% of organic hydrocarbon contaminants. The results of this study illustrate the potential of LTTD for not only economical and rapid soil remediation but also the enhancement of soil quality through beneficial reuse.</description>

      <title>Description, Development and Application of the Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling Tool for Global Cities (ITHIM-Global)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.11.24318676</link>

                Abstract The Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling Tool for Global Cities (ITHIM-Global) was developed as an open-source tool to assess the impacts of transport mode shifts on public health and the environment in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the need for such assessment is urgent and rising. The model simulates the impacts on all-cause and cause-specific mortality and years of life lost outcomes through a multi-pathway framework, specifically including physical activity, air pollution exposure, and road traffic fatalities. In addition, the model estimates changes in carbon dioxide emissions resulting from these mode shifts. ITHIM-Global employs a quasi-microsimulation approach that enables individualized exposure estimates by age, sex, and activity levels and utilises up- to-date exposure and dose-response functions that account for the non-linear relationship between physical activity levels and health. To demonstrate its functionality, document its strengths and weaknesses, and aid users, the model was applied to Bogota, Colombia, using three hypothetical scenarios, each shifting 5% of trips to one of bus, car, or cycling. Results indicate that increasing public or active transport modes enhances public health, primarily driven by gains in physical activity and to a lesser extent by reductions in traffic-related emissions. Conversely, a shift to car usage worsens health outcomes due to decreased physical activity and increased pollution exposure. ITHIM-Global serves as a flexible, detailed Health Impact Assessment (HIA) tool adaptable to urban areas across LMICs and this article delves into underlying assumptions and their influence to advance generalisable lessons on risk assessment and model development. The modular structure of ITHIM-Global, its covering of individual and population-level analyses, and extensive documentation provide an accessible, evidence-based approach for city planners and practitioners to optimize transport policies that support public health and mitigate environmental harm. Graphical Abstract Highlights We describe the Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling Tool for Global cities (ITHIM- Global), designed for low- and middle-income country (LMIC) cities. We apply ITHIM-Global to Bogot&#225;, simulating impacts from three mode shift scenarios with a 5- percentage point increase in car, cycling, and bus shares. We simulate the impacts on physical activity, air pollution, road traffic fatalities, and attributable mortalities and years of life lost. We describe in detail the model&#8217;s elements to aid future uptake, development, and extension to other cities. We discuss strengths, weaknesses, and underlying assumptions to advance generalisable lessons on risk assessment and model development.</description>

      <title>Clonal differences in ecophysiological responses to imposed drought in selected &lt;i&gt;Eucalyptus grandis&lt;/i&gt; x &lt;i&gt;E. urophylla&lt;/i&gt; hybrids</title>

                Measuring ecophysiological responses of Eucalyptus clones grown under reduced water availability could assist in clonal selection for climate resilience. We hypothesized that clonal variation in chlorophyll a fluorescence was more readily detected than variations in leaf-level gas-exchanges when two-year-old E. grandis x E. urophylla hybrid clones (C1, C2, C3, and C4) were grown under rainfed (RF) and water-restricted (WR) conditions were evaluated during dry and rainy seasons, in the morning and midday diurnal periods. The C2 clone was the most drought tolerant as it had a similar net CO2 assimilation rate (A) considering the RF and WR conditions at midday during the dry season, while C1, C3, and C4 CO2 assimilation rates (A) decreased by 29.1 %, 28.3%, and 13%, respectively. This response was associated with a reduction to a lesser extent in leaf water potential, stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rates (E) (ca. 10%, 30% and 13% under WR, respectively), when compared to the other clones during the dry season at midday. The lower leaf to air vapor pressure deficit of C2 contributed to its greater water use efficiency (WUE), resulting in greater total dry mass gain. C1, C3 and C4 were less drought tolerant, decreasing gs, E and especially A under WR, resulting in lower WUE and total dry mass gain. Chlorophyll a fluorescence indexes were better indicators of drought tolerance compared to gas-exchange parameters in definition of drought tolerance of clonal Eucalyptus. Three drought sensitive clones showed low photochemical efficiency under WR, with the electron transport rate being impaired between photosystems II and I, indicated by the greater changes in photosynthetic performance index (PIabs). Under WR conditions, Fv/Fm, &#936;0, &#934;E0, and PIabs decreased in all clones while &#934;D0 and DI0/CS0 increased, with C2 showing the most stable responses suggesting that the photochemical apparatus was the less damaged by drought. Thus, C2 was the best clone for regions with water scarcity.</description>

                Quantum computing (QC) provides a promising avenue toward enabling quantum chemistry calculations, which are classically impossible due to a computational complexity that increases exponentially with system size. As fully fault-tolerant algorithms and hardware, for which an exponential speedup is predicted, are currently out of reach, recent research efforts are dedicated to developing and scaling algorithms for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices to showcase the practical utility of such machines. To demonstrate the utility of NISQ devices in the field of chemistry, we apply our recently developed FAST-VQE algorithm and a novel quantum gate reduction strategy based on propositional satisfiability together with standard optimization tools for the simulation of the rate-determining proton transfer step for CO2 hydration catalysed by carbonic anhydrase resulting in the first application of a quantum computing device for the simulation of an enzymatic reaction. To this end, we have combined classical force field simulations with quantum mechanical methods on classical and quantum computers in a hybrid calculation approach. The presented technique significantly enhances the accuracy and capabilities of QC-based molecular modeling and finally pushes it into compelling and realistic applications. The framework is general and can be applied beyond the case of computational enzymology.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Use of Fly Ash and Marble Coarse Aggregates as Eco-Friendly Replacements in Concrete Production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2478/jaes-2024-0031</link>
      <description>Saloua Filali, Abdelkader Nasser, Journal of Applied Engineering Sciences. 14(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405231118

                Abstract This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing fly ash and marble coarse aggregates as sustainable substitutes in concrete production, responding to the increasing demand for infrastructure and the necessity to diminish the carbon footprint of construction materials. By partially substituting cement, a material that generates substantial greenhouse gas emissions, fly ash, a by-product of coal combustion, recognizes its capacity to reduce CO2 emissions. The stone processing industry produces marble waste, which, by repurposing otherwise wasted byproducts, offers an environmentally sustainable solution, simultaneously reducing the use of natural resources in the manufacture of traditional aggregates. The research aims to assess the effects of incorporating various ratios of fly ash, ranging from 10% to 50%, and marble coarse aggregates, ranging from 10% to 90%, on the workability, compressive strength, split tensile strength, and flexural strength. The results show a moderate decrease in a slump, with an 18.66% reduction at 50% marble coarse aggregates and 30% fly ash, and a significant increase in compressive strength, with a 60.22% improvement at 56 days with 40% fly ash and 70% marble coarse aggregates. Split tensile strength also improved by 35.50% to 36.66%. Non-destructive tests confirmed the structural integrity of the concrete. This study emphasizes the potential of fly ash and marble coarse aggregates as eco-friendly substitutes in concrete production.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Cogeneration to Support a Net-Zero, High-Renewable Electricity Grid</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17246219</link>
      <description>Juan Matthews, William Bodel, Gregg Butler, Energies. 17(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405242412

                UK Government projections anticipate increasing electricity use, provided by variable renewables (i.e., wind and solar PV). A side effect of increasing the proportion of variable renewable generation is increased support costs, including curtailment, energy storage, and (most significantly) the cost of supplying electricity for periods of high demand when variable renewable generation is low. As the proportion of variable renewable capacity increases, demand for supporting capacity increases but the capacity factor of the support generation decreases, raising the support costs. Using nuclear power for dedicated baseload supply makes the situation worse. This paper explores in the UK context an original low-cost solution using nuclear cogeneration with hydrogen production as the main application. Electricity is diverted at low cost to the grid at times of high demand when renewables are not available. This ensures nuclear maintains a high capacity factor. When higher temperature advanced systems become available, using thermal energy storage will increase the nuclear electrical capacity. This &#8220;Flexible Nuclear&#8221; scenario substantially reduces support costs for accommodating variable renewables, saving GBP 14 bn/yr and leading to an 80% reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions, compared to a recent UK Government scenario utilising a large capacity of hydrogen and unabated gas generation at very low capacity factors.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Mineralization of Chloroquine in a Filter-Press-Type Flow Reactor in Batch Recirculation Mode Equipped with Two Boron-Doped Diamond Electrodes: Parametric Optimization, Total Operating Cost, Phytotoxicity Test, and Life Cycle Assessment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14120918</link>

                This study investigated the electro-mineralization of chloroquine (CQ) in a filter-press-type flow reactor using two BDD electrodes operating in batch recirculation mode. The optimal operating parameters were established using response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite rotatable design (CCRD) with three parameters: current density (j), initial pH (pH0), and volumetric flow rate (Q), with the mineralization efficiency of (CQ) and specific energy consumption (SEC) as responses. Optimal operating parameters were j = 155.0 mA/cm2, pH0 = 9.75, and Q = 0.84 L/min within a reaction time of 9 h, leading to a maximum mineralization efficiency of CQ of 52.59% and a specific energy consumption of 15.73 kW/mg TOC, with a total operating cost of USD 0.18 per liter. Additionally, an ultra-high-performance chromatography study identified three by-products (4-amino-7-choloroquinoline, formic acid, and acid acetic) of CQ degradation. Furthermore, the phytotoxicity test indicates that the electrochemical wastewater proposed decreased the effluent&#8217;s phytotoxicity, and an increase in the percentage of Vigna radiata germination was observed. The carbon footprint of optimized electrochemical mineralization of chloroquine is 2.48 kg CO2 eq., representing a 48% reduction in cumulative energy demand (CED) when the source of energy is a mixture of fossil fuels (50%), wind (25%), and photovoltaic (25%) energy.</description>

      <title>Carbon Soil Mapping in a Sustainable-Managed Farm in Northeast Italy: Geochemical and Geophysical Applications</title>

      <description>Gian Marco Salani, Enzo Rizzo, Valentina Brombin, Giacomo Fornasari, Aaron Sobbe, Gianluca Bianchini, Environments. 11(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405444730

                Recently, there has been increasing interest in organic carbon (OC) certification of soil as an incentive for farmers to adopt sustainable agricultural practices. In this context, this pilot project combines geochemical and geophysical methods to map the distribution of OC contents in agricultural fields, allowing us to detect variations in time and space. Here we demonstrated a relationship between soil OC contents estimated in the laboratory and the apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measured in the field. Specifically, geochemical elemental analyses were used to evaluate the OC content and relative isotopic signature in collected soil samples from a hazelnut orchard in the Emilia&#8211;Romagna region of Northeastern Italy, while the geophysical Electromagnetic Induction (EMI) method enabled the in situ mapping of the ECa distribution in the same soil field. According to the results, geochemical and geophysical data were found to be reciprocally related, as both the organic matter and soil moisture were mainly incorporated into the fine sediments (i.e., clay) of the soil. Therefore, such a relation was used to create a map of the OC content distribution in the investigated field, which could be used to monitor the soil C sequestration on small-scale farmland and eventually develop precision agricultural services. In the future, this method could be used by farmers and regional and/or national policymakers to periodically certify the farm&#8217;s soil conditions and verify the effectiveness of carbon sequestration. These measures would enable farmers to pursue Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) incentives for the reduction of CO2 emissions.</description>

      <title>Decarbonization of oil rig platforms: An integrated approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.30574/wjarr.2022.14.3.0655</link>
      <description>Kelvin Edem Bassey, World Journal of Advanced Research and Reviews. 14(3)] 2022. https://openalex.org/W4405263930

                The decarbonization of oil rig platforms is increasingly critical as the global energy sector transitions toward more sustainable practices. This paper presents an integrated approach to reducing carbon emissions from offshore oil rigs, focusing on the synergy of renewable energy integration, carbon capture and storage (CCS), operational efficiency, and supportive policy frameworks. Offshore oil platforms are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and their decarbonization is essential for aligning the oil and gas industry with global climate goals. This paper explores the potential of renewable energy sources, such as offshore wind and solar power, to replace fossil fuel-based energy generation on oil rigs. The integration of hybrid energy systems that combine wind, solar, and energy storage solutions offers a promising path toward continuous and reliable power supply while reducing emissions. Additionally, the implementation of CCS technologies on oil platforms is reviewed, highlighting their role in capturing and storing CO2 emissions, thereby mitigating their environmental impact. Operational efficiency and process optimization are also examined as critical components of decarbonization efforts. By improving energy efficiency, reducing flaring, and enhancing digitalization and automation, oil rigs can significantly lower their carbon footprint. Waste heat recovery is identified as another opportunity to convert excess heat from operations into useful energy, further contributing to emission reductions. The paper also emphasizes the importance of policy and regulatory support in driving decarbonization initiatives. Effective regulatory frameworks, economic incentives, and international cooperation are crucial for overcoming the technical, economic, and social challenges associated with decarbonizing oil rig platforms. In conclusion, the decarbonization of oil rig platforms requires a comprehensive and integrated approach that leverages technological innovation, operational improvements, and robust policy support. By addressing the challenges and opportunities outlined in this paper, the oil and gas industry can play a vital role in the global effort to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change.</description>

      <title>Impact of Wall Paint Solar Absorptance on CO2 Emissions in Residential Buildings: A Case Study from Bangkok</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14123958</link>
      <description>Rungroj Wongmahasiri, Tarid Wongvorachan, Chaniporn Thampanichwat, Suphat Bunyarittikit, Buildings. 14(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405321513

                Electricity consumption in buildings is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which drive climate change. Reducing electricity use in residential buildings, which account for approximately 20% of Thailand&#8217;s total electricity consumption, represents a key opportunity for lowering greenhouse gas emissions. The aim of this study was to assess the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions through the use of appropriate solar absorptance in wall paint, conducted via an energy simulation using a representative residential building model from Bangkok. The DOE2.1E program was employed to simulate a standard two-story house commonly found in Thailand, with an approximate floor area of 120 square meters. The window-to-wall ratios were set at 10% and 20%, and air conditioning usage was modeled for nighttime hours. External wall paint was assigned varying solar absorption coefficients, ranging from 10% to 90%. Greenhouse gas emissions were calculated by multiplying the simulated annual electricity consumption by the emission factor, expressed in kgCO2eq/kWh, provided by the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization. The results indicated that adjusting wall paint solar absorptance from 10% to 90% led to a 10% variation in both energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, potentially reducing CO2 emissions by approximately 411&#8211;456 kgCO2eq per house per year. Therefore, implementing regulations that mandate the use of wall paints with appropriate solar absorption coefficients could significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to environmental protection efforts in Thailand.</description>

      <description>Timothy Held, Jason Miller, Kyle Sedlacko, Joshua D. Cameron, Scott Morris, Jeong-Seek Kang, Mark G. Turner, Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405424559

                Abstract Pumped thermal energy storage (PTES) offers a cost-effective means to store electrical energy for long duration by utilizing a heat pump cycle to transfer thermal energy from a low temperature reservoir (LTR) to a high temperature reservoir (HTR). The heat pump compressor, which represents a significant driver to the cost, performance and operating characteristics of the PTES system. During charging (&amp;gt;100 MW), traditional compressor scaling charts indicate that the operating conditions needed would be best served by a multistage axial compressor. The conceptual design of a large-scale CO2 axial compressor was completed, including mean-line estimates of the compressor performance at full power conditions. At steady state, full power operation, the isentropic efficiency and mechanical efficiency of the compressor have significant impact on the cycle design and round trip efficiency of the PTES system. The results of the conceptual design were used to refine the PTES cycle design and updated operating conditions provided for further aero design optimization. An important characteristic of the PTES system is its ability to charge at variable rate, which provides significant challenges on compressor operability, especially for a compressor that will be coupled to a fixed-speed synchronous motor. Cycle studies of variable charging rate processes have been conducted, and the impact of compressor operating map characteristics explored. Based on initial modeling studies, single compressor operation can be achieved down to at least 50% of rated power, with further reductions possible depending on the characteristics of the compressor map speedlines.</description>

                Shallow geothermal energy (SGE) is a promising green and sustainable energy source, gaining prominence in light of the dual-carbon target. This study investigated the SGE resources in the Yinchuan area. Suitability zones and the potential of SGE resources were determined based on the comprehensive analysis about thermophysical parameters, hydrogeological conditions, and geological environment. Our findings revealed that the effective thermal conductivity in the Yinchuan area surpasses those of other cities, indicating significant potential for SGE. The thermostat layer depth ranges from 40 to 60 m, with a geothermal gradient between 0.81 and 6.19 &#176;C/100 m. Regions with poor adaptability for a borehole heat exchanger (BHE) are mainly distributed in the western and southern parts of the Yinchuan area, whereas moderately and highly adaptable areas are primarily located in the central and eastern areas, respectively. The total geothermal resource of the BHE in the Yinchuan area amounts to 1.07 &#215; 108 GJ/a, generating significant economic benefits of 1.07 &#215; 109 CNY/a and saving 1.09 &#215; 106 t/a of standard coal annually. This initiative leads to significant reductions in CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions by 2.61 &#215; 106 t/a, 1.86 &#215; 104 t/a, and 6.57 &#215; 103 t/a, respectively. Additionally, it results in potential savings of 0.309 &#215; 109 CNY/a in environmental treatment costs. The methods and models used in this study have potential for similar geothermal surveys in arid and cold regions. The results also contribute essential insights for policy formulation and sustainable development strategies related to shallow geothermal resources in the Yinchuan area.</description>

      <title>Life Cycle Assessment of End-of-Life Tire Disposal Methods and Potential Integration of Recycled Crumb Rubber in Cement Composites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app142411667</link>
      <description>Girts Kolendo, Viktoria Voronova, &#290;irts B&#363;manis, Aleksandrs Korjakins, Di&#257;na Baj&#257;re, Applied Sciences. 14(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405366430

                Globally, 1.5 billion annual tire outputs generate a substantial volume of end-of-life tires (ELTs), creating significant environmental challenges. Despite increased recovery rates, ELT management costs in Europe underscore the need for proactive strategies to mitigate environmental and health risks. This study comprehensively evaluates the environmental impact of disposal methods, including landfilling, incineration, and crumb rubber production, using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) via the OpenLCA software 2.0.2. While incineration is sometimes identified as a disposal method, unprocessed scrap tires have potential applications in civil engineering that can better align with sustainability goals. Detailed ELT composition analysis reveals significant recycling potential, with car and truck tires containing 10&#8211;20% steel fiber content, less than 1&#8211;8% textile fibers, and approximately 80% natural and synthetic rubber content. Recycling 1 ton of ELTs saves an estimated 1.4&#8211;1.6 tons of CO2 Eq. compared to incineration. Mechanical recycling and application of recycled crumb rubber in concrete show significant environmental advantages, reducing mass density by approximately 55% and enhancing ductility by up to 40%, according to material testing results. These properties make crumb rubber particularly suitable for acoustic and resilient applications. Additionally, its elasticity and durability offer effective solutions for shoreline reinforcement, mitigating erosion and providing stability during flooding events. When used as a replacement for river sand in cement composites, crumb rubber contributes to a 24.06% reduction in CO&#8322; emissions, highlighting its potential for environmentally friendly construction.</description>

      <title>Influence of fiber direction on the tribological behavior of carbon-reinforced PEEK at elevated temperature for application in gas turbine engines</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4067410</link>
      <description>Marie-Laurence Cliche, Robert Mone, Andre C. Liberati, Pantcho Stoyanov, Journal of Tribology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405306656

                Abstract The aerospace industry aims for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, requiring gas turbine engines to reduce CO2 emissions. This will impact engine material selection due to harsher operating conditions, limiting traditional metal/alloy use. While fibre-reinforced polymers (FRP) composites are commonly used in the aerospace industry, their use in gas turbine engines is often restricted by the lower operating temperatures of the polymer matrix. However, many studies have demonstrated the tribological potential of FRP in the fan section of the engines, but little attention has been given to the potential of orienting the fibers in the normal (i.e., out-of-plane) direction relative to the wear surface to leverage the anisotropic properties of FRP composites. This study aims to investigate the impact of fiber orientation on the tribological properties of carbon fiber/PEEK (CF-PEEK) at elevated temperatures. Three CF-PEEK samples with different fiber rientations were selected for the purpose of this study (parallel, anti-parallel and normal directions), as well as a fourth sample of pure PEEK. Tribological tests were conducted using a ball-on-disk tribometer at an elevated temperature of 200&#176;C to evaluate wear and friction behavior. The worn surfaces and counterfaces were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS). The findings reveal that CF-PEEK with fibers oriented in the normal direction demonstrates significantly enhanced tribological performance at elevated temperatures, achieving a 95% reduction in the friction coefficient and a 92% decrease in the wear rate compared to pure PEEK. A wear mechanism has been proposed to explain the superior wear resistance of normally oriented fibers in CF-PEEK, linking it to the development of a fiber-based interface during the run-in phase and the formation of a uniform transfer film.</description>

                Sulfidogenic bacteria cause numerous issues in the oil industry since they produce sulfide, corroding steel equipment, reducing oil quality, and worsening the environmental conditions in oil fields. The purpose of this work was to isolate and taxonomically identify the sulfidogenic bacteria responsible for the corrosion of steel equipment at the Karazhanbas oil field (Kazakhstan). In this study, we characterized five sulfidogenic strains of the genera Pseudodesulfovibrio, Oleidesulfovibrio, and Acetobacterium isolated from the formation water of the Karazhanbas oil field (Kazakhstan). Sulfate-reducing strain 9FUST revealed 98.9% similarity of the 16S rRNA gene sequence with the closely related strain &#8216;Pseudodesulfovibrio methanolicus&#8217; 5S69T and was studied in detail to enhance the taxonomic resolution. Strain 9FUST grew optimally at 23&#8211;28 &#176;C, pH 6.5, and 0&#8211;2% (w/v) NaCl. The strain used lactate, pyruvate, methanol, ethanol, fructose, ribose, and H2/CO2 (in the presence of acetate) as carbon and energy sources for sulfate reduction. Iso-C17:1 &#969;11, C15:0, iso-C15:0, and C16:0 were the predominant fatty acids. The genome is 4.20 Mbp with a G + C content of 64.0%. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA&#8211;DNA hybridization values with Pseudodesulfovibrio spp. genomes were 72.5&#8211;91.6% (&lt;95%) and 18.5&#8211;45.0% (&lt;70%), respectively, and supported our conclusion that 9FUST (=VKM B-3654T = KCTC 25498T) belonged to a novel Pseudodesulfovibrio species, for which the name Pseudodesulfovibrio karagichevae sp. nov. is proposed. Pangenome analysis of sixteen Pseudodesulfovibrio species and functional annotation analysis of identified genes revealed complete modules of enzymes of the main metabolic pathways, characteristic of bacteria of this genus, and unique genes highlighting the adaptations of strain 9FUST in carbohydrate metabolism, nutrient uptake, and environmental stress response. Isolation of these strains expands our understanding of the diversity of sulfidogens in oil reservoirs and can be used to test the effectiveness of biocides used in an oil field.</description>

      <title>Impact of solid waste classification on urban ecology and economy in Beijing: A quantitative research</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1080/12265934.2024.2438206</link>

                The challenge of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) management has become a critical barrier to the harmonious development of society. China has implemented MSW classification as a pivotal strategy for fostering ecological civilization. Despite extensive research on waste management, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluations that integrate both socio-economic and environmental impacts of MSW, particularly in the context of urban ecological systems. In response, this paper developed an integrated system dynamics (SD) model to evaluate the impacts of MSW classification on urban ecology and economy in Beijing, China. This model comprises three subsystems: waste generation, socio-economic benefit, and environment-resource benefit subsystem. It incorporates feedback loops, sensitivity tests, and extreme scenario testing, all of which have validated the robustness and consistency of the model. Scenario analysis was conducted to examine benefits and loss of MSW classification under different conditions. Using the MSW classification in Beijing from 2010 to 2019 as a case, the model assesses the socio-economic, environmental, and resource effects of waste classification. The assessment of results indicate a correlation between increasing separation rates of MSW and socio-economic gains. Specifically, as the separation rate rises, the socio-economic benefits shift from negative to positive. At optimal MSW separation rates, these benefits could represent up to 0.78% of Beijing's GDP. Environmentally, the model suggests that greenhouse gas emission reductions (in CO2 equivalent) over the 2010&#8211;2019 period could have varied from 2.4&#8211;3.62 million tons annually. Additionally, our findings reveal that for every 1% increase in MSW separation rate, the yearly potential land savings might range from 1,069.92 m&#178; to 1,276.98 m&#178;. These insights from the SD model underscore the importance of waste classification. They serve as a valuable resource for policymakers, and motivate resident participation in waste classification, highlighting the significant role of waste classification in sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Replacement of 8-Inch Gas Transmission Pipeline With Smartpipe&#174; Composite Liner in Roanoke County, Virginia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/ipc2024-133724</link>

                Abstract This paper provides an overview of Enbridge Gas Transmission and Midstream&#8217;s PHMSA special permitted project to install and use Smartpipe&#174; to retrofit 0.64 miles of an 8-inch diameter, 1965 vintage steel pipeline, known as the Line 3320A-100. The new 6.25-inch internal diameter (ID), 7.6-inch outer diameter (OD) Smartpipe&#174; was inserted through a small segment of the existing 8-inch diameter steel pipeline, which improves pipeline integrity and safety by eliminating corrosion and increasing resistance to third-party damage. Smartpipe&#174; also significantly reduced the environmental impact and disturbance associated with the excavation, earth disturbance, and other activities that would have been necessary with removal of the existing 8-inch diameter steel pipeline and the installation of a new steel pipeline in the right of way (ROW). In addition to an overview of the engineering design and construction of the project, the short- and long-term use case of the Smartpipe technology over traditional materials is explored. Smartpipe&#174; offers a high strength composite pipe liner solution that involves a trenchless installation within the existing steel line to minimize disruption to both operations and the environment. Embedded fibre optics within the Smartpipe&#174; offer real time leak detection monitoring capabilities and ROW activity real time monitoring along the entire length of the pipe. This ESG centric solution not only provides a reduction in carbon footprint when compared to traditional construction methods (open trench pipe replacement and horizontal directional drill replacement) and it is designed to address high consequence and difficult to access areas where operator systems may pass through. Smartpipe&#174; has high pressure capabilities to provide repurposing opportunities for aging, derated and abandoned pipe assets. Smartpipe&#174; is DOE tested for hydrogen use and compatibility with CO2 to provide a bridge to future energy sources. This study serves as a valuable case for industry professionals, offering lessons learned, a PHMSA special permit application template for Smartpipe&#174; replacements as well as education and knowledge on the Smartpipe&#174; technology and installation considerations.</description>

      <title>Completion Design Optimization as a Function of Reservoir Quality in Tight Reservoirs: A Big Data Approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/223954-pa</link>
      <description>Tamer Moussa, Hassan Dehghanpour, SPE Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405367314

                Summary Over the past decade, more than 40,000 multifractured horizontal wells (MFHWs) were completed in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB), making Canada the third largest oil exporter in 2022. However, this process consumed more than 56 billion gallons of water, with more than 30 billion gallons unrecovered&#8212;equivalent to the annual water consumption of a city of 1 million for nearly 5 years. This raises concerns about water use efficiency in fracturing operations. Can big data mining reveal the relationship between reservoir quality, fracturing design parameters, and process efficiency? This research aims to develop a hybrid analytical and machine learning (ML) workflow to optimize completion design as a function of reservoir quality in tight reservoirs. To achieve this objective, we analyze data from more than 14,000 wells in the Montney formation. Using core analysis and well log data, we develop a support vector machine (SVM) to predict permeability and a fuzzy clustering model to estimate fracturability. We categorize Montney&#8217;s lithology through hierarchical clustering. With 3D kriging interpolation, we fill missing data and create high-resolution 3D petrophysical maps, which help derive a reservoir quality index (RQI) map to identify the sweet spots for completing new wells. We introduce a stage placement efficiency (SPE) metric to evaluate fracture stage placements in-line with the RQI. Finally, we develop neural network&#8211;based proxies that predict well performance based on reservoir quality, geomechanical properties, and completion design, incorporating more than 40 completion parameters, the RQI, and historical production data. The results reveal a higher degree of homogeneity in the upper Montney compared to the middle and lower segments. Generally, completion design parameters significantly impact MFHW productivity more than formation characteristics. Applying the proposed proxy to Montney-oil MFHWs could increase fracturing water recovery by 94.4%, reduce injected water volume by 22%, and boost cumulative oil production by 37.9%. The proxy aims to enhance fracturing water efficiency. A 1% reduction in freshwater consumption in the WCSB could save more than 100 million gallons of fresh water and cut CO2 emissions by up to 2,000 tons, equivalent to removing more than 1,000 gasoline cars from Canadian roads.</description>

His initial research interest focused on surface reactivity of heterogeneous catalysts, and later expanded to include electrocatalysis and photoelectrocatalysis for energy harvesting and conversion. Notably, his seminal contributions to the fundamental understanding of CO2 and N2 reduction have led to new advances in designing electrocatalytic systems for sustainable fuels.He remains a leading advocate for reducing our carbon footprint through the development of sustainable fuels. The Department of Physics at DTU has been organizing a summer school for students and young researchers for the last two decades. (1) During my recent participation in the 2024 SurfCat Summer School (Figure 1), I had the opportunity to converse with Prof. Ib Chorkendorff.Figure 1Figure 1. During a discussion with Ib Chorkendorff at the 2024 SurfCat Summer School, Kobaek Strand, Denmark. (Photo Courtesy: P. Kamat)High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlidePK: What were the early motivations that led you to get interested in electrocatalysis research?IC: From a young age, I was deeply interested in energy and energy conversion. This interest dates back to my high school days in the 1970s in Denmark, when car-free Sundays were introduced due to gasoline and oil shortages&#9472;an energy vulnerability that left a lasting impression on me.During my studies, I specialized in surface science, though without focusing specifically on energy, as the crisis had subsided for the time being. While working on my master's degree, I had the opportunity to spend six months at Haldor Topsoe A/S, a Danish catalyst manufacturer. This experience helped me realize what I wanted to pursue as a career. After completing my Ph.D. in surface science of rare earth metals and their alloys, I did my postdoctoral work with John Yates at the University of Pittsburgh, where I earned experience on surface reactions and catalysis.In the early part of my career, I focused on single-crystal surface reactions and thermal catalysis, supported by collaborations with Haldor Topsoe, who encouraged more rigorous teaching of these subjects at DTU. By the turn of the century, I returned to my passion for energy, initiating a project called "Towards a Hydrogen Society", where fuel cells were seen as an efficient energy source.Initially, electrochemistry held little appeal for me, as I associated it mainly with corrosion of automobiles and electroplating, both of which I found uninteresting. However, from an energy perspective, new possibilities opened up, and I began exploring fundamental single-crystal studies, fuel cells, and eventually photoelectrocatalysis. In recent years, my work has focused on energy conversion&#9472;particularly water splitting&#9472;and the challenge of coupling protons directly to CO2 or N2 to produce chemicals and fuels.My approach has generally been based on my background in surface science. I avoided battery research, since much of the activity in that field occurs at buried interfaces that are challenging to access with these methodologies. Nevertheless, I eventually ventured into that area as well, particularly in the context of ammonia synthesis, which involved a lithium-mediated process where complex solid&#8211;electrolyte interface (SEI) layers form. Although I found ways around this challenge, a deeper understanding of the SEI layer remains still desirable.Overall, my journey has been driven by the desire for energy self-sufficiency and a curiosity about the atomic-level processes underlying catalytic reactions.PK: What are the current grand challenges in electrocatalysis research? How does your Center strategize the efforts to address them?IC: The ultimate goal of our center is to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, and the most straightforward way to achieve this is by entirely out-phasing fossil fuels. This approach should take priority over, for example, CO2 sequestration for good, which I fear may serve as an excuse for oil companies to continue with "business as usual". Achieving fossil-free energy is feasible since we have abundant solar and wind resources, even in a northern country like Denmark. Let's electrify everything we can and then concentrate on finding solutions for what cannot be electrified.To manage energy sustainably, we'll need to store it long-term in the form of chemical energy. We will also need to produce chemicals and fuels, the latter primarily for applications like long-haul shipping and aviation, where electrification is less viable. From an electrochemical perspective, this process begins with water splitting to produce hydrogen and oxygen&#9472;an essential step that, despite being established for centuries, still involves a &#8764;30% energy loss. Reducing this loss is crucial. While some argue that energy will be "free" in the future, this is unrealistic; people investing in solar panels and wind turbines will want a return. The negative prices for renewable energy are likely only during a transitional period where we need to create a market for energy conversion which is basically non-existing today.Hydrogen produced from water splitting can support well-established thermal catalysis for manufacturing chemicals and fuels from CO2 and N2. These processes may need to adapt, though, as energy becomes decentralized. For example, while ammonia production today relies on large facilities due to the capital-intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process caused by its high operating pressure, it might make more sense to shift to a decentralized approach since both energy production and fertilizer use are very delocalized.The oxygen generated from water splitting will also be valuable, as it can support biomass combustion in power plants to stabilize intermittent renewable energy sources. This process will produce CO2 at much higher concentration, which we can use as a feedstock for synthesizing organic chemicals and aviation fuel. So, in this context, CO2 capture and storage is relevant. We are asking questions like, "Can we make the conventional processes more efficient or find entirely new routes for energy conversion?" It is naturally also important to ask if it makes any sense&#9472;often we see new approaches where simple energy efficiency calculation rules them out beforehand. We are currently focusing on electrochemical hydrogenation of both CO2 and N2 to create competitive alternatives to conventional thermal processes. Entirely new approaches like photoelectrocatalysis, which captures light energy and directly converts it into fuels or chemicals, remains an attractive concept that we also have pursued. However, we also recognized that it may not be viable within the time frame needed to address climate challenges, so we have reallocated more funding to ammonia synthesis, exploring both thermal and electrochemical approaches. Combining these two approaches may ultimately be the most effective option. This flexibility in funding allows us to make strategic adjustments as we gain new insights and progress.PK: Water electrolyzers have been commercialized for large-scale hydrogen generation. What other electrocatalysis-based technologies are likely to emerge in the near future?IC: In my opinion, good progress has been made in electrochemical CO2. The field has managed to achieve reasonable current densities, though challenges remain with selectivity, stability and energy efficiency. I find N2 hydrogenation particularly interesting, but it is further from the target, as the current density is still an order of magnitude too low, and energy efficiency needs improvements by a factor of at least 3&#8211;4.There are also some more localized solutions that are of interest: For example, we have made a spin-off company, HpNow, that focuses on electrochemical production of hydrogen peroxide. Such decentralized facilities could also be used to upgrade waste streams or for cleaning purposes. However, these applications are more aligned with niche industries rather than addressing the larger-scale challenges.PK: You have co-founded three companies based on the work carried out in your laboratory. What were some of the challenges you encountered in taking the laboratory work to the development of commercial products?IC: First, I'd like to point out that starting companies has often happened more by opportunity than by initial planning. Sometimes, you gain enough insight to see potential, and if Ph.D. students or postdocs are interested in pursuing it, starting a company becomes a possibility. In principle, it's relatively easy to start a company; however, creating one that actually turns a profit, rather than simply burning through investments, is a completely different challenge. The current investment climate makes getting started feasible, but the real hurdle is scaling up to mass production. This stage requires much more capital, and it's often where scientists lose influence and interest. Fortunately, there are others who thrive on this phase and enjoy managing those challenges.Of the three companies I've helped start, two are still healthy and active&#9472;HPNow and Spectroinlets&#9472;while the technology from the third company, RenCat, was recently bought out by Alfa Laval, which I also consider a success. There have also been other startups from our lab, though I'm not directly involved with them as I didn't believe they were viable.PK: What is your advice to young researchers who aspire to engage in renewable energy research?IC: I would say to any young researcher aspiring to make science a career: stay curious and appreciate that, as a university professor, you have the freedom to choose your field of research&#9472;provided you can secure funding for it. Also, you will have great colleagues and meet many interesting and friendly people on your path. Of course, you should also enjoy teaching, as it's an integral part of being a professor. There are also excellent opportunities in industry that can fulfill many of the same goals, though the degree of freedom is naturally not the same.Scientifically, renewable energy research presents many unanswered questions that are essential to solving our pressing global challenges. This field is appealing because it is easy to justify why this type of research is important and how it can contribute to a better world. However, the main driving force should still be curiosity, as that's what propels research forward. You may not achieve your initial goal, but along the way, you might gain deeper insights that contribute to the field, paving the way for future breakthroughs by you or others.Research is far from a straightforward path from A to B. Sometimes, unexpected solutions emerge while trying to answer completely different questions or challenges. For this reason, it's important to stay open-minded and opportunistic, looking beyond the immediate project.Finally, I would encourage the research community to be more rigorous in their approach. Too often, the focus is on the quantity of publications rather than the content and quality. Research quality could be significantly improved if we adhered to the "good old school" standards, where measurement uncertainties were carefully considered and reported. I always say, "seeing something once doesn't mean you've truly seen it." Ideally, I like to see results replicated three times to establish measurement reliability and give a standard deviation. Unfortunately, too often, observations are measured only once and cannot be reproduced. So, tighten up your ship, because, as Richard Feynman famously said, "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool."With that, I wish you good luck out there. Nothing beats luck, but it usually only comes after hard work&#9472;and one must also be capable of recognizing it.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!AuthorPrashant V.

      <title>Development of high performance cement-based composites reinforced with nonwoven fabrics from sustainable raw materials and textile wastes</title>

                (English) Currently there is a growing concern about the sustainability of the construction sector due to its great contribution to climate change. Approximately one third of carbon dioxide emissions are produced by this sector, both during the construction and operational phases of buildings. Another environmental problem is the abundance of waste produced by industrial processes and products at the end of their useful life. In this sense, the use of more sustainable building materials and, in particular, the reduction of the necessary amount of cement is of great interest. This thesis focuses on developing and characterizing sustainable cement-based building materials reinforced with biodegradable nonwoven fabrics or produced from fibers recovered from textile wastes, mainly designed to be applied on thin panels for application on ventilated facades, pavements and reinforcement of masonry structures, as well as for the development of multifunctional sandwich panels for applications on facades or ceilings. The first phase of the research focuses on the preparation and characterization of the nonwoven structures. On the one hand, nonwoven fabrics are prepared from biodegradable fibers such as flax fiber, and on the other hand, nonwoven fabrics are prepared with fibers from post-consumer textile waste, both of a technical nature such as aramid fibers, or from end-of-life textiles from fashion, such as cotton-polyester blends. In a second phase, the preparation and characterization of the reinforced composite materials is carried out. The compounds are characterized mechanically (with the bending-deformation test), microstructurally (with observations from SEM and BSEM) and finally the thermal and fire resistance properties are evaluated. In a third and final phase of the research, comparisons are established between the different reinforcements, evaluating the reinforcement capacities that each of these textiles give to the cement matrix. From the results, it can be concluded that cementitious composite materials reinforced with the nonwoven fabrics developed in this thesis become a suitable material for its application as a construction material. Despite multiple works related to the recovery of textile waste and its applications in composites have been published, there is limited knowledge about the combination of raw materials that we propose in this project, as well as for its possible applications. In particular, there is also limited knowledge on cement-based composites in which the reinforcement is a nonwoven fabric prepared from biodegradable fibers or recovered from textile waste. In this sense, composites reinforced with textile waste represent a great advance in sustainability for the sector, in addition to offering resistance properties that are highly suitable for this type of construction applications. The results will help to develop new sustainable building materials with a high content of raw materials recovered from waste and that, applied in panels for ventilated facades, floors and roofs or for the reinforcement of masonry, will contribute to improve the energy efficiency of buildings already reduce emissions generated for the construction sector. (Espa&#241;ol) Actualmente existe una preocupaci&#243;n creciente por la sostenibilidad del sector de la construcci&#243;n debido a su gran contribuci&#243;n al cambio clim&#225;tico. Aproximadamente un tercio de las emisiones de di&#243;xido de carbono son producidas por este sector, tanto durante la fase de construcci&#243;n como operativa de edificios. Otro problema ambiental es la abundancia de desechos producidos por los procesos industriales y los productos al final de su vida &#250;til. En este sentido, el uso de m&#225;s materiales de construcci&#243;n sostenibles y, en particular, la reducci&#243;n de la cantidad necesaria de cemento es de gran inter&#233;s. Esta tesis se centra en desarrollar y caracterizar materiales de construcci&#243;n sostenibles a base de cemento reforzados con telas no tejidas biodegradables o bien producidas a partir de fibras recuperadas de residuos textiles, principalmente dise&#241;ados para ser aplicados sobre paneles delgados para su aplicaci&#243;n en fachadas ventiladas, pavimentos y refuerzo de estructuras de mamposter&#237;a, as&#237; como para el desarrollo de paneles s&#225;ndwich multifuncionales para aplicaciones en fachadas o techos. La primera fase de la investigaci&#243;n se centra en la preparaci&#243;n y caracterizaci&#243;n de las estructuras no tejidas. Por un lado, se preparan telas no tejidas a partir de fibras biodegradables como es la fibra de lino, y por otro lado se preparan telas no tejidas con fibras procedentes de residuos textiles post-consumo, tanto de car&#225;cter t&#233;cnico como es la fibra de aramida como procedentes de textiles en desuso del &#225;mbito de la moda, como son las mezclas algod&#243;n-poli&#233;ster. En una segunda fase se realiza la preparaci&#243;n y caracterizaci&#243;n de los materiales compuestos reforzados. Los compuestos se caracterizan mec&#225;nicamente (con el ensayo a flexi&#243;n-deformaci&#243;n), microestructuralmente (con observaciones de SEM y BSEM) y finalmente se eval&#250;an las propiedades t&#233;rmicas y de resistencia al fuego. En una tercera y &#250;ltima fase de la investigaci&#243;n se establecen comparativas entre los diferentes refuerzos, observando las propiedades de resistencia que le otorgan cada uno de estos refuerzos textiles a la matriz de cemento. Se concluye que los materiales compuestos cementantes reforzados con telas no tejidas deviene un material apto para su aplicaci&#243;n como material de construcci&#243;n. A pesar de la existencia de m&#250;ltiples trabajos relacionados con la recuperaci&#243;n de residuos textiles y sus aplicaciones en composites, existe un conocimiento limitado sobre la combinaci&#243;n de las materias primas con residuos particulares que proponemos en este proyecto, as&#237; como para sus posibles aplicaciones. Particularmente, tambi&#233;n hay un conocimiento limitado sobre compuestos a base de cemento en los que el refuerzo es una tela no tejida preparada a partir de fibras biodegradables o recuperadas de desechos textiles. En este sentido, los compuestos reforzados con residuos textiles suponen un gran avance en materia de sostenibilidad para el sector, adem&#225;s de ofrecer propiedades de resistencia muy adecuadas para este tipo de aplicaciones en construcci&#243;n. Los resultados ayudar&#225;n a desarrollar nuevos materiales de construcci&#243;n sostenibles con un alto contenido en materias primas recuperadas de residuos y que, aplicados en paneles para fachadas ventiladas, suelos y cubiertas o para el refuerzo de mamposter&#237;a, contribuir&#225; a mejorar la eficiencia energ&#233;tica de los edificios y a reducir las emisiones generadas para el sector de la construcci&#243;n.</description>

      <title>Decarbonisation pathways for &lt;scp&gt;UK&lt;/scp&gt; transport</title>

                Have we run out of road? While other sectors of the UK economy have made some progress in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions1 since 1990, the transport sector, taken to include both air and surface modes as well as domestic and international movements from the UK, has yet to do so (figure 1). In 2019, emissions were 11 per cent above 1990 levels compared to the 53 per cent reduction achieved by the rest of the economic sectors.2 Emissions from transport finally fell below the baseline level in 2020, due to the impacts on travel activity posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, only to bounce back again since. The latest figures (2023) show transport, including international movements, standing at 151 MtCO2e, essentially still at the 1990 baseline. Without some specific policy instruments used over recent decades, the situation would have been even worse. The mandatory CO2 vehicle emissions performance standards for cars and vans since 20094 and the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation since 20085 brought continuous attention to the carbon intensity of the light duty vehicle fleet in use. However, the benefits achieved by these efforts have been more than negated by the cumulative impact of a combination of trends, many of which still prevail today. These include discrepancies between vehicle test-cycle and real-world performance, the growth in the size and weight of new cars, the slow uptake of pure battery electric vehicles, the increase in light goods vehicles (or 'van') traffic, minimal progress in efficiency improvements in heavy goods vehicles, and the immense rise in air passenger demand. "if transport decarbonisation fails, net zero will also fail" Thus, any discussion of UK transport decarbonisation pathways must begin with the hard truth that the sector's entire emissions reduction challenge will have to be achieved in less than half the allotted 60-year period set down by the UK Climate Change Act to achieve 'net zero' (1990-2050). In this next phase, the easier wins already secured in the rest of the economy will no longer be available to compensate for transport's failure. Any limited carbon sequestration options that may come online to allow the UK to still emit greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 (as defines the 'net' aspect of the target) are reserved for aviation in this sector; therefore, all surface transport modes must achieve 'absolute zero' emissions.6 Consequently, accounting for 36 per cent of UK emissions in 2023, if transport decarbonisation fails, net zero will also fail. Moreover, 2030 is the year designated by the UK for its legally-binding nationally determined contribution (NDC) towards meeting the UN goal under the Paris Agreement. This requires at least a 68 per cent fall in territorial emissions7 which translates into a quadrupling of the rate of emissions reductions outside of the power sector.8 A radically different decarbonisation pathway for transport is now an imperative to start to make deep cuts over the next half a decade. But what might this consist of and is it achievable? First, we must understand why the official pathway set out by the UK government needs urgent reorientation. UK pathways are set by the Climate Change Committee (CCC) and are responded to in government strategy documents. The response so far to transport's consistent failure to meet its targets has not, however, been to change the approach to achieving them, but to downscale the ambition for the sector. In July 2021, the Department for Transport (DfT), published its first Transport Decarbonisation Plan (TDP).9 This presented a set of upper and lower pathways for domestic transport, the most ambitious of which went further than the CCC's 'Balanced Pathway'. Just a few months later, these ambitions were downscaled in the Net Zero Strategy (NZS)10 and reduced even further just 18 months later in the Carbon Budget Delivery Plan (CBDP),11 by which time 72 per cent of the potential ambition set out in the TDP had disappeared.12 In May 2024, the CBDP was subject to a legal challenge. This is perhaps no surprise given it was itself the product of a legal challenge to the NZS, which was deemed unlawful on the grounds of not having a robust set of delivery plans and proposals. Another revised plan must now be produced by May 2025 which quantifies and reduces this delivery risk. "One assessment concluded that transport accounts for 70 per cent of all UK emissions not yet covered by any policy at all" Transport has been identified as the sector with the largest gap between polices that are firmly in place and the decarbonisation required to meet the CCC's fifth carbon budget (to 2032). One assessment concluded that transport accounts for 70 per cent of all UK emissions not yet covered by any policy at all.13 This equates to 97 MtCO2e of cumulative carbon savings between 2024 and 2032, to be achieved through measures not yet in consultation or even suggested as an ambition, whilst also assuming that all of the confirmed policies reach their full potential. In separate analysis, Marsden compared the CBDP and the CCC sixth carbon budget (to 2037) and found a 182MtC cumulative overshoot for the domestic sector alone, even if the ambitious zero-emissions vehicle mandate (ZEV &#8211; see below) and some other confirmed small behaviour change initiatives are fully realised.14 Marsden stresses that this is equivalent to 10 years' worth of road-travel carbon reductions resulting from the activity suppressed during the Covid-19 lockdowns. Both analyses add to a substantial body of work that has consistently found confirmed policies to be grossly inadequate compared to a carbon budget apportioned to local, regional, sub-national and national UK contexts. It is striking that, despite adopting different methodologies, carbon budget periods, geographical and temporal scales and system boundaries, these studies still arrive at essentially the same unequivocally consistent conclusions: car use will have to be massively reduced even with ambitious electrification. Hopkinson et al's comparison of a set of distinct modelling analyses prior to 2020 found an average total car mileage reduction of at least 20 per cent below ~2019 levels would be necessary by 2030.15 Given that around half the time has already elapsed since the baseline year used by these studies, but car mileage remains only slightly lower and EV uptake slower than expected,16 we can assume that this would now translate into at least a 50 per cent drop. Given this imperative to achieve such dramatic reductions in car CO2 emissions in the near term, the remainder of this paper considers what a transport decarbonisation pathway would look like if this level of demand reduction was included in the revised UK strategy to be adopted by May 2025. The aggressive favouring of electrification of passenger cars as the central solution is already adopted in UK policy, as in most developed economies. The ZEV, requiring vehicle manufacturers to sell an increasing proportion of electric vehicles (EVs) each year, ratcheting up to 100 per cent by 2035, accounts for 80 per cent (113 MtCO2e) of the domestic transport sector's confirmed policy to 2032.17 In the first year of application, manufacturers are already requesting more support to help reach their targets. Consequently, the size of the aforementioned policy gap is a likely underestimate as it assumes savings from confirmed policies would be delivered in full on a cumulative basis. Planning for underachievement until such times as the sales of EVs are firmly on the required trajectory would be an application of the precautionary principle that has been absent from the governance of transport decarbonisation, despite its track record of delivery failure. "SUVs could represent 75 per cent of new registrations in 2027" Given the ZEV already represents the fastest possible rate of EV uptake deemed commercially, practically and politically achievable,18 any remaining technological improvements must be secured from the non-battery-electric-vehicle car fleet. Success depends on the rate of new car efficiency improvements between now and when they are banned from sale,19 as well as the overall scrappage rate. Having reduced slightly year-on-year for over a decade, average tailpipe emissions from petrol, diesel and non-plug-in hybrid vehicles began increasing from around 2017, although petrol variants have recently stabilised.20 In large part this is due to the increasing size and weight of cars. The SUV ('sports utility vehicle') is now the most popular passenger vehicle, making up 60 per cent of UK new car registrations in 2023. This is up from 'just' 50 per cent in 2021 and, if this trend continues, would mean SUVs could represent 75 per cent of new registrations in 2027.21 More than four-fifths of these are petrol, diesel, hybrids or plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) which, on average, produce 20 per cent more emissions than an average medium-sized car. This amounts to significant additional emissions over the next 15 or more years, as these cars remain a high proportion of the fleet, particularly as new cars are being seen to last longer in use.22 EVs are included in the trend towards increased size and weight, and their larger energy demands may prevent the renewable electricity system from expanding at the pace assumed in many models.23 There are also wider material impacts involved in this 'mobesity' epidemic, including land use, health, safety and monetary resources.24 So, one clear option on the 'supply side' is to begin restricting the sale of the most carbon-intensive cars immediately. Nowhere has yet to restrict these vehicles from entering a fleet through regulation. However, there are attempts to disincentivise their uptake, such France and Norway's weight-based motoring taxes, or Paris where parking fees for SUVs have recently tripled. The more that the size and weight of cars can be reduced, the less people will have to have their car use constrained through pricing or physical restrictions, although the latter would still be necessary according to modelled scenarios with both of these measures and more.25 When this trade-off was put to members of the Climate Assembly UK (CAUK), 'quickly stop selling the most polluting cars' gained the most first preference votes &#8211; 86 per cent said they were generally in agreement with it, second only to increased investment in public transport.26 Unlike the CAUK recommendation to improve public transport, however, a restriction on new car sales has not entered policy discussions. In the first budget of the recently elected Labour government (October 2024), circulation taxes27 were increased in the first year based on tailpipe emissions, especially for the largest luxury variants.28 But most significantly, unlike the devolved regions of Scotland and Wales, there is as yet no explicit target to reduce car distance travelled in accordance with carbon budget constraints. Labour's first budget showed little indication that this is being considered, having prolonged a freeze in fuel duty escalations and maintained a five pence per litre reduction, even at a time when fuel costs are relatively low. All of this is not to say that there is no attention at all on modal shift. DfT's transport decarbonisation plan contained nearly 80 'commitments', including reiteration of targets for buses and active travel (to have 50 per cent of trips in towns and cities walked, wheeled, or cycled by 2030). These are already off track, but have nevertheless been adopted by the new administration. There are, however, two major flaws with the dominant approach to mode shift. "on their own, improvements in public transport patronage, walking and cycling will only substitute for car trips at the very margins of what is required" The first is that, on their own, improvements in public transport patronage, walking and cycling will only substitute for car trips at the very margins of what is required. Places with high levels of cycling tend to have low levels of public transport (eg Copenhagen and Amsterdam) and vice versa (eg Vienna, Zurich, Madrid and London).29 Very strong evidence shows that effective reductions in car travel happen only when improvements to alternatives are coupled with restrictions to car use with pricing, road closures and parking restrictions.30 The few examples of places that have successfully reduced car use have implemented some form of charging measure, such as a congestion charge, low emissions zone or workplace parking levy.31 Even where public transport has been made free at the point of use, or fares markedly lowered, car trip substitution has been found to be minimal, with most coming from trips that had been previously walked or cycled.32 The second major flaw is the focus on the share of car trips rather than car miles that could theoretically be shifted to alternative modes. In an extensive analysis breaking down the source of emissions from personal transport across different distance bands and modes of transport (including air), Wadud et al present the astounding statistic that only 2.7 per cent of UK personal travel journeys are for long distance travel (&gt;50 miles one-way), but they account for 61.3 per cent of the miles and 69.3 per cent of the CO2e emissions from passenger travel.33 Yet, virtually all attention on demand management is on the large proportion of short car trips (eg 53 per cent &lt; four miles). Such statistics are repeated often and with vigour to claim huge opportunity for carbon reductions through mode shift. Wadud et al's analysis, however, shows that even if all the 74 per cent of car trips under eight miles were switched to zero-emissions active modes, this would only reduce emissions from the total transport sector by 9.3 per cent. By contrast, if all the car trips over 50 miles were shifted to rail, representing less than 2 per cent of all trips undertaken, the sector's emissions would reduce by 5.2 per cent. "The policy focus probably needs to be somewhere between these very short and the longest trips, targeting medium distance trips" In addition to a lack of concurrent car restraint measures, the above statistics explain why so called 'good practice' largely falls down when examined from a decarbonisation perspective. For instance, 'Dutch levels of cycling' &#8211; where alternatives to the car for local journeys, particularly cycling, appear to be the default &#8211; are often cited as a key aspiration to contribute to climate objectives. 29 per cent of all trips in the Netherlands are by bicycle, compared to less than 2 per cent in the UK. Yet, average per capita annual car driver mileage in the Netherlands in 2019 was almost double that of England.34 Consequently, despite the fact that UK residents fly more on average, per capita average carbon emissions from transport are almost equivalent in the two countries (figure 2). Put simply, this is due to a lack of restrictions or disincentives to own and use cars in the Netherlands, coupled with the distances travelled on longer journeys, especially for leisure and business. On the face of it, it should be possible to target a small percentage of longer car trips much more rapidly than it would be to reach three quarters of them that are short. This would involve a reorientation of focus away from the relatively short distance commute trips, towards discretionary leisure activities and family visits. These are not only more challenging to provide public transport services for, given their fragmented temporal and spatial patterning, but are more politically sensitive. There is also very little evidence on what works in this domain. During the summer of 2022, unlimited travel on regional rail, trams and buses was offered in Germany for nine euros a month. Almost half the population took up this opportunity and rail patronage was significantly increased, especially in rural areas and at weekends. However, Quinio36 found that the trips were largely additional rather than substitutions for car use. It is unclear, though, what would have happened if the scheme had been sustained over a longer period, or if it had been coupled with an increase in the price of car use. The policy focus probably needs to be somewhere between these very short and the longest trips, targeting medium distance trips (between 10 and 30km) that are too long for active travel but are still undertaken on a regular basis.37 These would require investment in rapid transit systems including trams, express buses and rail. E-bikes could be a new and important mode. Philips et al. use spatial micro-simulation to estimate the maximum capability to reduce emissions by substituting private car travel for e-bike in England.38 They estimate this capacity would translate into a reduction of 16 MTCO2 over and above conventional walking and cycling, greatest in rural areas and the urban fringe. This would require a shift in investment towards long distance cycle networks and bike sharing schemes, away from urban centres where they tend to be focused today. However, once again the real-world evidence is revealing that, in the absence of strong car-restraint policies, e-bikes may tend to substitute for conventional bike use rather than the car for many journeys, particularly leisure.39 "Average car occupancy has fallen over the past decade" The attempt to alter some of the longer distance trips to become medium or shorter distance trips through destination shifting is also part of the solution, including for leisure trips. As Mitchell et al emphasise: "Long-term development planning cannot solve the carbon problem given the imperative for action before the end of the decade. However, it does have to be ready with projects and proposals which align with the actions which will have been taken to accelerate decarbonisation."40 Another route to car use reduction, aside from mode switching, is to increase occupancy of cars. Average car occupancy has fallen over the past decade from an average of 1.6 to 1.5 people per vehicle.41 At the same time, the number of cars per capita has increased, meaning that each car is being utilised less and less.42 34 per cent of cars do not go out on any given day and only 14 per cent of all cars in the fleet are on the move during the busiest evening weekday peak hour (pre-Covid-19).43 Transport policy is delivering neither on its economic nor its environmental promise. Despite the transport sector's consistent track record of failing to meet its decarbonisation targets, the approach to the problem remains the same as it has always been: to swap out the fossil fuels in the system with electricity or some form of alternative, including synthetic, liquid fuels. Yet, we are left with little doubt that for transport to pull its weight towards the 2030 nationally binding contribution, and beyond, we need a wholescale shift in what is deemed important to focus on. On the supply side, the focus on EVs must be rebalanced with a renewed focus on the tailpipe emissions of the approximately eight million new ICE vehicles that will still be sold into the UK market by 2030 and will still be in circulation until well into the 2040s. This requires immediate restrictions on the size and weight of cars that can be sold into the UK car market. Without this, much deeper cuts in car use will be required. The weight of EVs as well as ICEs must also be considered as a target for policy, given the system-wide energy demand implications of the larger battery requirements. "There must be a focus on where the carbon is actually generated and what holds car ownership and use in place" On the demand side, almost all attention to 'behaviour change' and mode shift in policy will result in marginal carbon savings at best. There is an urgent need for the dominant thinking about how to reduce car use needs to be turned on its head. Reductions in car use have and will only materialise if improvements to the alternatives are coupled with restrictions in the form of parking, pricing or road space reallocation. There is no alternative to this. The evidence is clear that even making a public transport system free will not make a dent in car use on its own. Secondly, the conventional focus on short, mainly urban trips, often narrowly focused on the commute and the journey to school, will only serve to maintain the status quo if longer distance car trips are not also meaningfully discouraged and catered for by alternative means, including encouraging shorter trips through destination shifting. There must be a focus on where the carbon is actually generated and what holds car ownership and use in place. Therefore, we cannot decarbonise transport without making changes in these predominantly leisure and family-oriented activities. The reality is, there are no good examples of where these longer-range car trips have been shifted to other modes or reconfigured to become shorter journeys at scale. This is where the new frontier is for transport decarbonisation over the next decade. Given the scale of this challenge, planning for failure and exploring the synergies between concurrent adaptation and mitigation options, to create both a flexible, resilient as well as lower carbon system, would seem to be the only true meaningful pathway around which to plan a new delivery strategy.

      <title>How to reduce your lab's carbon footprint</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1242/jcs.263722</link>

                Although we are all dedicated to conducting high-quality, cutting-edge research in the basic and applied biomedical sciences, it is important to acknowledge the environmental impact of our work. The biomedical research sector is a significant contributor to the production of non-degradable plastics, as well as toxic and chemical waste (Urbina et al., 2015). Additionally, this sector demands substantial energy, not only for experimental work but also for computing, communication and data science activities. We are now facing emerging health and climate challenges, including increased pollution, the pervasive presence of microplastics and a rise in climate-related health issues that stem, in part, from our research. In recognition of our responsibility to future generations, it is imperative that we work actively to minimize our environmental footprint (Freese et al., 2024). Efforts need to be made in all sectors, including the biomedical research sector, to meet the UK's net zero CO2 emissions target by 2050. With this in mind, UK Research and Innovation (UKRI; one of the major funding agencies in the UK) recently co-produced a concordat for the Environmental Sustainability of Research and Innovation Practice (https://wellcome.org/what-we-do/our-work/environmental-sustainability-concordat), hosted by the Wellcome. A number of major funding bodies, such as Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and Wellcome, and universities are signatories. Some UK funding bodies, such as Wellcome and CRUK, have also recently started asking the labs of grant holders to reduce the environmental impact of their research, and we will likely see other funding bodies following suit.Until very recently, most sustainability efforts have been driven by grassroots actions from a few labs (Dobbelaere et al., 2022). However, best sustainability practices are often not widely adopted because they remain for individual labs to develop and implement. This requires a considerable amount of time and knowledge from researchers. In addition, the exchange of best practices is largely through word-of-mouth between interested labs, although online forums and websites are now appearing (Box 1). Additionally, new practices and methods might raise suspicion and resistance if they have not been tested up to the exacting specifications required for high-quality science.Box 1. Online forums and blogsThe Company of Biologists' sustainability initiative. Launched in 2020, this initiative provides blog posts on the topic of sustainability. The Company of Biologists also offers grants to support sustainable conferencing events and a tree-planting scheme for every paper published. https://www.biologists.com/sustainability-hub/The 'lab concious' blog. This site offers advice and tips on sustainability, such as recycling and reuse, and provides information on environmentally friendly lab supplies. It also has a list of useful websites from other green groups. https://www.labconscious.com/blogThe Laboratory Efficiency Assessment Framework (LEAF). Developed by UCL, this provides a framework to implement sustainability practices in research labs, with criteria associated with three levels of sustainability in labs. https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sustainable/take-action/staff-action/leaf/take-part-leafMy Green Lab. A US-based organization that provides a blog, a podcast, information and a program with certification for labs to become more sustainable. https://www.mygreenlab.org/Lab sustainability award from EMBO. EBMO recently launched this award to recognize pioneering progress in sustainability efforts in research. EMBO also publishes articles on sustainability in research. https://www.embo.org/the-embo-communities/embo-lab-sustainability-award/University of Edinburgh sustainability website. The University of Edinburgh provides a comprehensive website offering information, training and advice on sustainable topics in the context of education and research. https://www.ed.ac.uk/sustainabilityThe Sustainable European Laboratories network. This offers information and best practices on sustainability in research in Europe. It aims to support the establishment of green initiatives and influence policymakers and key stakeholders to make a positive impact on lab practices. https://sels-network.orgIt is becoming clear that research labs will be most successful in becoming more sustainable if all stakeholders are involved and supported (Woolston, 2024; Winter et al., 2023). Research institutions, universities and funders have an important role to play here in advising and supporting the research workforce, whether they are office or lab based, on how we can reduce our carbon footprint. At the moment, any efforts in making our workflows more sustainable usually come on top of the current existing workload of research staff. Sustainability workflows also have an upfront cost that needs to be met by funders: for example, although the reuse of lab consumables (such as glass pipettes and flasks) is considered to be more sustainable than using disposable or recyclable consumables, the costs associated with washing and reusing glass flasks or pipettes are often higher than those associated with the use of disposable counterparts (owing to the staff costs involved in running a washing-up facility). This highlights the crucial need for continued funding of core facilities within research institutions. In addition, research labs consume more energy than offices, due to their particular requirements for ventilation, negative pressure and temperature control. Research institutions therefore need to be forward thinking when designing new research buildings to make them more energy efficient (https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/29413.pdf) and mindful of the environment. Overall, all stakeholders &#8211; from those working in the lab to those providing funding and infrastructure &#8211; have an important role to play.The lab users &#8211; postdocs, PhD students, research staff &#8211; who work day-to-day in the lab will have a good idea of what workflows can be changed to reduce the energy used and the waste generated. There could be discussions within a group and/or a committee setup representing the individual groups within an institute or department. The decision-making and implementation process works best when all relevant parties feel engaged. The goals and targets must be clear, measurable and achievable for everyone. Setting targets, monitoring the reduction in energy, plastics or waste and having a reward system helps recognize people's efforts and contributions. It can also motivate people to further reduce their carbon footprint.Collective action and the sense of working towards a common goal can also provide a focal point for a department or institution, bringing people together. Websites and noticeboards hosted by the research institution, unit or department are useful ways to communicate initiatives and information both locally and more widely with labs at other institutions.Although it is important that people in the lab make their research practices more sustainable, there is regular lab turnover such that information or training might get lost. The principal investigator, however, will often have a good overview of the lab's history and a deeper understanding of the health and safety measures in place and how compatible they are with making workflows more sustainable. Even though they might spend less time in the lab, they might notice practices that can be improved. Waste reduction and sustainability should not be done at the expense of safety, but instead should work together to make our research programs more environmentally friendly.Additionally, some researchers and early-career scientists joining the lab might also suffer from eco-anxiety, which can cause mental health issues (Pearson, 2024; Lawrance, 2024) and could affect laboratory practices negatively. Supporting individuals to channel that anxiety and turn it into action towards sustainability goals, within the lab or department, will have a positive impact on the local research community and is a powerful way to look after everyone's mental health.Changing people's habits is difficult. For people to get engaged, the new workflow must be easy to implement. Ideally, the long-term goals and cost-benefits have to be clear. It also helps if there is training, a reward system, and an explicit long-term vision that mobilizes staff.Of course, you might think that if it is only your lab doing this, then the reduction in carbon footprint will be negligible. However, if many labs worldwide start adopting more ecological workflows, the impact will become significant. Below, are some easy tips that can help you and your lab get started: 1.Plan your experiment! The most efficient and sustainable way to carry out an experiment is to design it well, so that it works first time.2.Switch the temperature of the ULT freezer from &#8722;80&#176;C to &#8722;70&#176;C. This saves around 28% energy consumption (https://www.ed.ac.uk/files/atoms/files/efficient_ult_freezer_storage.pdf). Organize your freezers and make an inventory of their contents to minimize the time they are open for when searching for a reagent. Not only will you save energy, you will also save time and reduce frustration! Regularly defrost the freezers so they consume less energy.3.Put your equipment on a timer, so that it switches on and off automatically when possible, and switch off non-sensitive equipment in the evening. Ensure all lab members switch off non-essential equipment when they have finished using it.4.Label bottles (e.g. of solutions) with their contents, the date made and the person who made it. Record any chemicals that are ordered and the date they are received. This helps with managing the chemicals in the lab/institution and facilitates correct waste disposal. Work with your safety office to provide clear and accessible information about waste disposal. Make a list of commonly used lab chemicals and their waste disposal routes and make this list easily accessible to all researchers. A list of chemicals that cannot be disposed of via the sink should be posted in the lab. For some substances, only small volumes of these should be disposed of via sinks and they should be diluted.5.Use glass rather than plastic pipettes and flasks where possible. This significantly reduces the CO2 equivalent footprint (Farley and Nicolet, 2023), and the cost of glass washing is lower than the cost of using single-use plastic, once washing-up facilities are in place.6.Share and fix equipment within your department. Take steps to make equipment accessible to multi-users. The benefits are that the costs for maintenance and repair can be shared. A booking system can facilitate the coordination and tracking of users.7.Inactivate biological material rather than autoclave it. All biological waste is incinerated for biosafety reasons, so autoclaving is often unnecessary. Replacing autoclaving with inactivation where possible saves energy.8.Reuse should always be the top choice, with recycling the second option. Much of the packaging used for life science consumables can be reused, with some providers allowing returns of polystyrene (Winter et al., 2023) and packages for this purpose. Distributors are also moving away from plastic and polystyrene packing, thanks to the community's demands for biodegradable packaging. Insulated packaging is become increasingly eco-friendly. For example, hemp, paper straw and sheep wool are easily recycled but can also be used for other projects.9.Offer an induction to students and laboratory newcomers to explain the laboratory's sustainable practices. Ideally the institution or department will offer this training on a regular basis as there is a fast turnover within academia.10.Adopt a climate-conscious approach to travel and collaborations &#8211; think about where and how often you travel, and what mode of transport you use; find collaborations and networks that are accessible via low-carbon travel. These often work well because you might be able to meet and discuss science in person more frequently or be in the same time zone to setup online discussions. Local collaborations also facilitate the transfer of knowledge and expertise between early career researchers because such interactions can be more spontaneous.The lockdowns during COVID showed us how important communication and social interactions are to humans. It also taught many of us about the power of online discussion and meetings. During the lockdowns, we all participated in virtual meetings that enabled us to remain connected, work together and facilitate knowledge exchange. Since then, virtual and hybrid meetings have become commonplace. However, this shift also highlighted the limitations of online meetings and seminars compared to their in-person counterparts. When attending events online, many distractions can make it challenging to maintain focus. Additionally, engaging with other scientists online does not replicate the valuable and often spontaneous discussions that occur during coffee breaks or while queuing for lunch at in-person events. These spontaneous interactions often spark innovative ideas and foster collaborations, underscoring the irreplaceable nature of face-to-face meetings. Attending meetings is essential for keeping up to date with the advancements of the field and in-person attendance at meetings is particularly important for early-career researchers to build their networks. Nonetheless, when organizing an in-person conference or event, there are many aspects that can be improved to reduce its CO2 carbon footprint.For example, meeting organizers can select food that has a lower environmental impact while respecting people's dietary requirements. To reduce plastic waste, ask the caterers to provide fruit, biscuits and cakes that are freshly made, rather than biscuits and snacks in individual wrapping. Food could also be locally sourced and there could be a significant proportion of vegetarian food. It is important to select minimally processed food, as many highly processed items have non-conventional ingredients to which people might be intolerant or allergic (for example, pea, soya or buckwheat are increasingly common allergens) as well as tending to have a higher carbon footprint.In terms of the scientific program, it is possible to invite a keynote speaker to speak remotely. One can also encourage participants to travel by low-carbon transport, ideally by train. There are also alternatives to traditional in-person meetings. Multi-hub meetings, for example, are a new and interesting meeting model, whereby a meeting is run remotely in different countries with local in-person hubs that foster real interactions (Lowell et al., 2022). To support such incentives, it is possible to raise funding to provide travel awards to participants; EMBO and The Company of Biologists have funds to support greener travel and they are also open to funding innovative ways to make conferences sustainable. Further support, including advice and funding opportunities, can also be found at The Company of Biologists' sustainability hub (Box 1).Improving sustainability within our research workflows will substantially reduce our environmental impact and lower our carbon footprint. Additionally, it has the potential to foster greater inclusivity and enhance the engagement of our research communities. By involving all researchers and funding bodies that provide support for sustainable practices and national standards, our sector can transform biomedical research into a discipline that is significantly and positively sustainable.</description>

      <title>Editorial: Personalized therapy in ARDS, volume II</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2024.1533593</link>
      <description>Denise Battaglini, Claude Gu&#233;rin, Patr&#237;cia R. M. Rocco, Frontiers in Medicine. 11(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405456468

                Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can result from a variety of clinical conditions, causing lung injury either directly through local inflammation or indirectly because of systemic inflammatory mediators [1] ARDS is associated with high morbidity and mortality [2]. Its pathophysiology is complex, involving the activation and dysregulation of multiple overlapping pathways related to injury, inflammation, and coagulation, both in the lung and systemically [3]. Sepsis is the most common cause of ARDS, with pulmonary sepsis (e.g., pneumonia) being the predominant etiology. Non-pulmonary sepsis and non-infectious causes, such as pancreatitis, aspiration of gastric contents, and severe traumatic injuries accompanied by shock and multiple transfusions, also contribute significantly to ARDS cases. Despite decades of experimental research into ARDS biology, these insights have rarely translated into effective therapies [4]. This lack of progress is often attributed to the substantial heterogeneity caused by the nonspecific clinical definition of ARDS [5].Identifying subphenotypes of ARDS-more homogeneous groups within the broader ARDS population-has emerged as a promising approach to unravel the syndrome's clinical and biological complexity, which many believe is a critical barrier to discovering effective treatments.Mechanical ventilation (MV) remains the cornerstone of supportive care for ARDS patients.However, improper MV settings can cause complications, most notably ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [6]. The regional heterogeneity of lung injury, combined with the uneven distribution of mechanical stress during ventilation, results in multiple mechanisms of VILI simultaneously affecting the lungs. While VILI primarily concerns the harmful effects of MV, similar injury pathways can also be triggered by vigorous spontaneous inspiratory efforts, which produce elevated transpulmonary pressures due to highly negative pleural pressures [7]. Furthermore, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, amplified in the injured lung by harmful MV practices, can enter the systemic circulation, exacerbating systemic inflammation and contributing to non-pulmonary organ failure.The recognition of ARDS heterogeneity, encompassing its biological, physiological, and radiological aspects, has led to progress in identifying distinct subphenotypes. A precisionmedicine approach that effectively classifies ARDS into more homogeneous subphenotypes could enhance our understanding of the syndrome's pathophysiological mechanisms and how these vary across patients, ultimately paving the way for more targeted and effective treatments [8]. This editorial highlights key studies from the research topic "Personalized Therapies in ARDS: Volume II," covering personalized MV techniques, ARDS treatments tailored to etiology, sub-phenotyping, and novel pharmacological strategies. ARDS, even within a single etiology such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), remains a heterogeneous syndrome requiring a personalized MV approach [9]. Evidence suggests that lung-protective MV strategies are not adhered to in approximately 69% of cases [10]. This underscores the need for individualized, yet standardized, MV management strategies informed by a comprehensive understanding of the patient's physiology. In this line, Patel et al. conducted a multicenter international randomized clinical trial (RCT) involving 95 ARDS patients to evaluate the feasibility of a physiological model-based decision support system (DSS) for tailoring MV strategies. Patients were randomized to receive either standard care (control) or DSS-guided care (intervention). Although there was no significant difference in average driving pressure between the groups, the intervention arm demonstrated improvements in the oxygenation index and ventilatory ratio during controlled MV mode compared to the control group. Additionally, the DSS led to a significant increase in ventilator adjustments, particularly for pressure settings and respiratory frequency.Importantly, the physiological condition of patients improved when approximately 60% of DSS recommendations were followed, reinforcing the value of personalized yet repeatable MV strategies. These findings highlight the potential of DSS tools to refine MV management, ultimately improving outcomes in ARDS patients through a more tailored approach.The equipment shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic presented extreme challenges for many countries. To address the scarcity of devices, alternative strategies were proposed [11,12]. Despite the global resource limitations, the emphasis on personalized MV strategies remained strong, even in scenarios involving shared ventilation between patients. Achanta et al. explored a ventilator-sharing system through benchtop testing that allowed simultaneous ventilation of two patients using a single mechanical ventilator, coupled with a monitoring system to remotely track pulmonary mechanics. The study extended to a swine translational model of lung injury induced by saline lavage to validate the system's functionality in both bench and in vivo settings. The benchtop testing demonstrated precise delivery of MV parameters. In the animal model, specific target inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes were set, and the system successfully adjusted for differences between the two pigs. For instance, if one animal reached its target volume or pressure before the other, it experienced a prolonged end-inspiratory pause and stopped receiving flow until both targets were met. While the system introduced a relatively individualized approach to MV settings, addressing some limitations of previous designs, it did not allow for self-tests on the shared ventilator or individualized management of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) [13] These limitations restrict its potential for safe application in human clinical settings.Over the past few decades, the primary objective of PEEP usage has evolved from solely improving oxygenation to prioritizing lung protection. An "optimal" PEEP simultaneously enhances alveolar recruitment and gas exchange while preventing overdistension and minimizing hemodynamic compromise. Once PEEP is set, it is important to regularly reassess its impact on cardiopulmonary function [14,15]. Circulatory failure can result from both too low and too high PEEP levels because they can raise pulmonary vascular resistance, hinder pulmonary circulation, and impede right ventricular performance [16]. Xingzheng et al. conducted a prospective paired-design study involving 52 patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS to evaluate the effects of different PEEP levels on cardiovascular function and the incidence of acute cor pulmonale (ACP). The study tested PEEP settings of 5 cmH&#8322;O, 10 cmH&#8322;O, and 15 cmH&#8322;O, while maintaining end-inspiratory plateau pressure &#8804;30 cmH&#8322;O. The incidence of ACP was 25%, with the highest occurrence observed at a PEEP of 15 cmH&#8322;O.As PEEP levels increased from 5 to 10 and 15 cmH&#8322;O, the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO&#8322;)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO&#8322;) ratio improved. However, higher PEEP values were associated with a modest rise in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO&#8322;). At a PEEP of 15 cmH&#8322;O, significant adverse cardiovascular effects were noted, including reduced tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, increased right ventricular end-diastolic area, elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, a 14% reduction in cardiac index, and an 18.1% drop in stroke volume index compared to PEEP settings of 5 or 10 cmH&#8322;O. Additionally, higher PEEP levels led to a marked decline in the end-diastolic volume index and extravascular lung water index. This study highlights the variability in ACP incidence depending on the PEEP setting in ARDS patients. PEEP levels must be carefully individualized based on the patient's cardiovascular function to optimize outcomes. Atakul et al. evaluated a closed-loop oxygen control system in 33 pediatric patients (aged 1 month to 18 years) undergoing invasive MV for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. Patients were randomized to begin with either manual adjustment or a two-hour period of closed-loop oxygen titration. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels were maintained within a predetermined target range using either automated or manual FiO2 adjustments. The closedloop oxygen control demonstrated significant advantages: patients managed with the automated system spent a significantly higher percentage of time within the target SpO2 range compared to manual adjustment (95.7% vs. 65.6%). Additionally, the automated system achieved a higher median SpO2/FiO2 ratio (p=0.001), required a lower median FiO2 (32.1% vs. 40.6%, p=0.001), and significantly reduced the number of manual adjustments (p&lt;0.001).Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is employed in patients with severe ARDS to support gas exchange, and deliver safe MV (Pplat), when other strategies fail to yield sufficient benefits [4]. Observational studies and meta-analysis found that ARDS patients in VV-ECMO significantly improved outcomes and lowered 60-day mortality more than those on traditional MV [17][18][19]. Current guidelines recommend using VV-ECMO for patients with severe ARDS, as defined by the EOLIA trial eligibility criteria, in centers meeting defined organizational standards. A bibliometric analysis by Lu et al. Sepsis-induced ARDS was more commonly linked to pulmonary infections caused by A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae, which were associated with higher mortality rates, worse APACHE II, SOFA, and SAPS II scores, and poorer oxygenation indices compared to ARDS from non-pulmonary infections. Both the PaO2/FiO2 ratio and ROX index were negatively correlated with prognosis.The antioxidant effects of vitamin C therapy may mitigate tissue injury induced by oxidative stress in sepsis. However, in adults with sepsis receiving vasopressor therapy in the ICU, those who received intravenous vitamin C had a higher risk of death or persistent organ dysfunction at 28 days than those who received placebo [20]. Alissa et al., in their review, highlighted the potential benefits of co-administering vitamin C in patients with sepsis and septic shock caused by pneumonia leading to ARDS.In conclusion, the presentation of ARDS varies significantly across three key dimensions: (1) etiological, (2) physiological, and (3) biological. This variability emphasizes that a "typical" ARDS does not exist. The lack of a uniform presentation calls for a personalized medicine approach. Advanced subphenotyping and integrative analyses of these variations may uncover additional treatable traits, paving the way for more targeted therapies.</description>

      <title>Making climate change a national health priority: Australia's first National Health and Climate Strategy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5694/mja2.52552</link>
      <description>Georgia Behrens, Madeleine Skellern, Alice McGushin, Paul Kelly, The Hon Ged Kearney, The Medical Journal of Australia. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405403836

                Climate change poses profound and urgent challenges to the health and wellbeing of people in Australia. With an average of 1.51&#176;C of warming since records began,1 the health impacts of climate change are already being felt across Australia.2 Meanwhile, the health system itself is responsible, either directly or indirectly, for around 5.3% of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.3 There is a clear need for Australia to achieve "healthy, climate-resilient communities, and a sustainable, resilient, high-quality, net zero health system."3 This vision is outlined in Australia's first National Health and Climate Strategy (hereafter, the Strategy), proudly launched in December 2023 by the Honourable Ged Kearney MP, Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care. In this perspective article, we review the Strategy's origins, development, and key features; discuss the challenges that must be tackled in the coming years; and highlight the leadership role that health professionals can play in the response to climate change. The National Health and Climate Strategy is built on decades of outstanding Australian work on climate change and human health. Australians have been at the forefront of climate and health research for more than thirty years, and have been pioneers in drawing the global health community's collective attention to the impacts of climate change on human health and wellbeing. We acknowledge the many individuals and organisations who have persistently advocated for human and planetary health for over a decade, and welcome their ongoing contributions and leadership in this space.4, 5 Consultation also highlighted the need to enable and embrace leadership on climate and health policy by First Nations people. Stakeholders spoke of the opportunities inherent in holistic partnerships with First Nations communities to improve health, reduce emissions and foster climate resilience. They also highlighted that First Nations peoples' deep and nuanced knowledge &#8212; developed over tens of thousands of years of close observation and sustained custodianship of Country &#8212; is not only crucial in addressing the impacts of climate change on First Nations peoples' health, but also can improve health and build climate resilience for all people in Australia. At the heart of the Strategy is an ambitious agenda to transform Australia's health system into one that is sustainable and climate resilient while improving care quality and health outcomes. The Australian Government recognises that insights and leadership from health professionals will be crucial to achieving this agenda. On health system decarbonisation, at the time of writing the Australian Government was working to publish baseline emissions estimates for the Australian health system, and to develop a net zero implementation guide for the Australian health system in collaboration with the Monash Sustainable Development Institute and state, territory and local health service partners. In the future, a key focus in our emissions reduction efforts will be supporting the provision of appropriate care and tackling unwarranted variations in care delivery. This will help to ensure that clinical care is of benefit to patients, and to avoid over-investigation, overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The Strategy will also guide work to design interventions &#8212; in close collaboration with health professionals and consumers &#8212; that reduce emissions while maintaining or improving care quality. Fortunately, improving care quality and reducing emissions often go hand in hand. For example, improving objective diagnosis of asthma, education on inhaler technique, and increasing use of preventive inhalers can help to improve health outcomes while reducing emissions from respiratory inhalers containing greenhouse gases.6 On health system resilience, the Strategy recognises the need to build capacity to anticipate, understand, plan for, and respond to escalating climate impacts on health, wellbeing, and delivery of care. At a national level, this will involve an in-depth consideration of climate impacts on health and health systems as part of the National Climate Risk Assessment, and development of a Health National Adaptation Plan to provide an overarching framework for nationally consistent health-related adaptation. The Australian Government is also developing guidance and tools to support health system climate risk assessments and adaptation planning at a local level. In addition, a voluntary pilot of new safety and quality standards on environmental sustainability and climate resilience for health service organisations is currently being administered by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality Health Care.7 The pilot aims to help embed the principles of environmental sustainability and climate resilience in care delivery and governance, and will inform the next edition of the National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards, which is due for release in 2027. Crucially, the Strategy reaches beyond the traditional confines of the health system, and seeks to promote health, sustainability and climate resilience across a variety of health-determining sectors. Many of the negative impacts of climate change on health will occur via impacts on the wider determinants of health, so it is critical that policies to ameliorate health impacts encompass these upstream drivers. Further, as measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from sectors beyond the health system will have significant health co-benefits, there is an important role for the health sector to ensure these co-benefits are considered in policy and decision making. We hope the Strategy will provide a platform from which to ensure that the health co-benefits of emissions-reducing policies are considered and accounted for in the years ahead. The Strategy's Health in All Policies approach is embodied in a wide range of cross-government initiatives at the intersection of climate change and human health planned for the years ahead. For example, in recognition that housing is a key determinant of health and wellbeing, the Strategy includes a commitment to consider the health benefits of climate-resilient housing in developing the National Housing and Homelessness Plan. Given that population health would be improved markedly by widespread uptake of more environmentally sustainable diets,8 work is underway with the National Health and Medical Research Council to consider sustainability in the updated Australian Dietary Guidelines. The built environment is an important source of health systems emissions, and also a strong mediator of climate impacts on health, so the Strategy will promote the consideration of health and climate resilience in future updates to the National Construction Code. In her speech launching the Strategy at the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28), Assistant Minister Kearney noted that its release, "highlights a beginning, and ahead of us lies the journey of delivering its ambitious program of work."9 In 2024, the National Health, Sustainability and Climate Unit has taken some of the first steps on that journey. Work has commenced on 31 of the 49 actions within the Strategy, with 12 of those 31 actions completed or in the final stages of completion. Planning has also commenced to deliver a further 14 actions. In addition to publishing baseline health system emissions estimates, the Australian Government will shortly be publishing new academic research about opportunities to reduce waste and make food more sustainable in the Australian health system. We have also been working with industry, clinicians, patients and other stakeholders to reduce emissions from respiratory inhalers and anaesthetic gases. Several state health systems have already shown leadership by removing the high emissions anaesthetic gas desflurane from their medicines formularies, while organisations such as Asthma Australia and the National Asthma Council have laid the groundwork for optimising asthma inhaler use for better asthma and climate outcomes, including with the National Sustainable Asthma Care Roadmap.10 Meanwhile, the interim Australian Centre for Disease Control, the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare, and the Council of Presidents of Medical Colleges have released a joint statement in which they agreed to work together to develop low-emissions models of care, and to mobilise and support the health workforce to lead the health system response to climate change.11 In implementing the Strategy, we expect to encounter challenges. These challenges include the need to resist siloed thinking and working to make the Strategy's Health in All Policies approach a practical reality. To help achieve this, we have established governance structures that will support multidisciplinary, cross-portfolio collaboration to deliver the Strategy's vision. Another key challenge will be achieving an appropriate level of national and international consistency, while also balancing the unique needs and circumstances of different jurisdictions. Many states, territories and local governments have led the way in health system decarbonisation and climate resilience to date. In implementing the Strategy, we will be looking to learn from and build on their innovation and progress, and seeking to add value to existing approaches. A key domain for Commonwealth leadership will be supporting international collaboration, particularly in areas that require changes to global supply chains and manufacturing practices. On Earth Day this year, the Australian Government announced that it has joined a collaboration with the United States and United Kingdom to align health system procurement standards to support decarbonisation.12 Commitment to this collaboration was reiterated at COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan.13 Australia is also engaged with efforts to develop new international standards for measuring the environmental impacts of health technology products. Frontline clinicians were instrumental in the Strategy's development, and will be even more crucial in its implementation. A net zero, climate-resilient health system must have as its bedrock a motivated, innovative, and upskilled workforce, that can translate the Strategy's vision and objectives into reality on the ground. Achieving such transformative change will require effective coupling of "top-down", government-led initiatives with "bottom-up" innovation and reform. The Strategy highlights a few examples of clinician-led initiatives that have already achieved exceptional outcomes for patients and the planet, and embody the creativity, care and collaboration that will be needed in the years ahead. For example, a team in the Royal Melbourne Hospital Emergency Department implemented a campaign to reduce unnecessary arterial blood gas and coagulation profile testing, which resulted in over 1200 unnecessary blood tests being avoided each month, with annual cost savings of $240 000 and emissions reductions of 900 kg carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e).3 We heard about dozens of inspiring frontline initiatives &#8212; and even more exciting ideas &#8212; such as this throughout Strategy consultations, and aim to support those on the frontlines to consolidate and expand their outstanding work. We have been impressed and inspired by clinicians' incredible passion for addressing climate change, and will work to support their longstanding, vital leadership towards a net zero, climate-resilient health system in the years ahead. The National Health and Climate Strategy sets an ambitious strategic direction for climate change and health policy in Australia. The Australian Government will lead the implementation of the Strategy over the next five years, and continue to pursue the Strategy's vision of "healthy, climate-resilient communities, and a sustainable, resilient, high-quality, net zero health system" over the coming decades. This work is a shared responsibility of every health professional and every part of the health system. We look forward to working collaboratively with stakeholders, including frontline health practitioners, to realise this vision in the years ahead.

      <description>Luc&#237;a Bel&#233;n Barandiar&#225;n Villegas, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405383325

                (English) To address the impacts of climate change, several measures have been suggested among which utilizing renewable energy sources such as geothermal energy and implementing technologies such as hydrogen storage or CCUS. Some of these solutions imply the injection of fluids into fractured rock masses (e.g. depleted O&amp;G reservoirs) with the subsequent change in local stress conditions. This alteration may lead to the initiation of micro-seismic events by reactivating existing faults or the generation of new fractures, with the risk of ultimately establishing pathways for fluid leakage. Additionally, depleted reservoirs contain multiphase and multicomponent fluids that could react chemically with the new injection fluids. Therefore, the accurate prediction of operation conditions demands advanced geomechanical software capable of evaluating the viability and safety of potential extraction or storage locations. In this context, the main objective of this thesis is to develop a thermo-hydro-mechanical multiphase model in fractured porous medium with the Finite Element Method using zero-thickness interface elements to model discrete discontinuities. The main assumptions of the model are: the small strain theory, the system composition with two fluid phases (liquid and gas), two species (water and dry gas) and one solid phase. The gas phase follows the ideal gas law and the liquid phase evaporation is considered. The main variables are: displacements, phase pressures and temperature. The formulation takes into account: the equilibrium equation, the mass balance equation of the water species, the mass balance equation of the gas species and the balance of energy. The formulation of the discontinuities considers similar assumptions as the porous medium and takes into account a reduction factor of the water retention curve parameters based on the mechanical opening of the fracture. The model has been implemented and validated with academic verification examples in a FE code. However, some limitations were observed related to the time integration scheme, the treatment of storage terms of the governing equations and the mass flow. This issues have motivated the following new developments: new mass-conservative approach for diffusion equations using FE formulations, a new physically-based exponential model which considers the pore size or aperture distribution in case of the porous medium or discontinuities, respectively, and a new damage-frictional law which properly models discontinuity closure. (Catal&#224;) Per mitigar les conseq&#252;&#232;ncies del canvi clim&#224;tic s'han proposat diverses mesures, entre les quals es troben l'&#250;s d'energies renovables com la geot&#232;rmia i el desenvolupament de tecnologies com l'emmagatzematge d'hidrogen o CO&#8322;, que requereixen la injecci&#243; de fluids dins de massissos rocosos fracturats (com els reservoris abandonats), cosa que suposa un canvi en l'estat tensional d'aquests. Aquesta alteraci&#243; pot ocasionar el desencadenament d'esdeveniments micro-s&#237;simics mitjan&#231;ant la reactivaci&#243; de falles geol&#242;giques o la creaci&#243; de noves fractures que, en &#250;ltima inst&#224;ncia, formarien camins preferencials per a la filtraci&#243; dels fluids. A m&#233;s, els reservoris abandonats contenen fluids multifase amb m&#233;s d'una esp&#232;cie que podrien reaccionar qu&#237;micament amb els nous fluids injectats. Per tant, la predicci&#243; precisa de les condicions d'operaci&#243; requereix una an&#224;lisi profunda de la problem&#224;tica, aix&#237; com disposar d'un programari geomec&#224;nic avan&#231;at capa&#231; d'avaluar la viabilitat i la seguretat dels possibles llocs d'extracci&#243; o emmagatzematge. En aquest context, l'objectiu principal d'aquesta tesi &#233;s el desenvolupament d'un model termo-hidro-mec&#224;nic (THM) acoblat multifase en un medi por&#243;s fracturat mitjan&#231;ant el m&#232;tode dels Elements Finits emprant elements junta de gruix nul de doble node per representar les discontinu&#239;tats. Les principals hip&#242;tesis del model s&#243;n: la teoria de petites deformacions, un sistema compost per dues fases fluides (l&#237;quida i gasosa), dues esp&#232;cies (aigua i gas) i una fase s&#242;lida; la fase gasosa es comporta d'acord amb la llei dels gasos ideals i es considera l'evaporaci&#243; de la fase l&#237;quida. Les variables prim&#224;ries s&#243;n: despla&#231;aments, pressions de fase i temperatura. La formulaci&#243; contempla: l'equaci&#243; d'equilibri, l'equaci&#243; de balan&#231; de massa de l'esp&#232;cie aigua, l'equaci&#243; de balan&#231; de massa de l'esp&#232;cie gas i el balan&#231; d'energia. La formulaci&#243; de les discontinu&#239;tats considera les mateixes hip&#242;tesis que el medi por&#243;s i pren en compte un factor de reducci&#243; dels par&#224;metres de la corba de retenci&#243; basat en l'obertura mec&#224;nica de la fractura. El model ha estat implementat i validat amb exemples de verificaci&#243; acad&#232;mics en un codi 3D d'Elements Finits. No obstant aix&#242;, durant la fase de validaci&#243; s'han trobat algunes limitacions del model, relacionades amb l'esquema d'integraci&#243; temporal, pel que fa al tractament dels termes d'emmagatzematge de les equacions de govern i els fluxos de masa. Aquestes limitacions han motivat els seg&#252;ents nous desenvolupaments: una nova formulaci&#243; que conserva la massa aplicada a les equacions de difusi&#243; en el medi por&#243;s i a les discontinu&#239;tats, una nova corba de retenci&#243; de tipus exponencial que pren com a punt de partida la porosimetria en el cas del medi por&#243;s i la distribuci&#243; d'obertures a les discontinu&#239;tats, i, finalment, una nova llei constitutiva cohesiva-friccional per a les juntes que permet la modelaci&#243; del tancament en desc&#224;rrega. (Espa&#241;ol) Para mitigar las consecuencias del cambio clim&#225;tico se han propuesto diversas medidas, entre las cuales se encuentran el uso de energ&#237;as renovables como la geotermia y el desarrollo de tecnolog&#237;as como el almacenamiento de hidr&#243;geno o CO2, que requieren la inyecci&#243;n de fluidos dentro de macizos rocosos fracturados (como los reservorios abandonados), lo cual supone un cambio en el estado tensional del mismo. Dicha alteraci&#243;n puede ocasionar el desencadenamiento de eventos micro-s&#237;smicos mediante la reactivaci&#243;n de fallas geol&#243;gicas o la creaci&#243;n de nuevas fracturas que en &#250;ltima instancia formar&#237;an caminos preferenciales para la filtraci&#243;n de los fluidos. Adem&#225;s, los reservorios abandonados contienen fluidos multifase con m&#225;s de una especie que podr&#237;an reaccionar qu&#237;micamente con los nuevos fluidos inyectados. Por lo tanto, la predicci&#243;n precisa de las condiciones de operaci&#243;n requiere un an&#225;lisis profundo de la problem&#225;tica, as&#237; como disponer un software geomec&#225;nico avanzado capaz de evaluar la viabilidad y la seguridad de los posibles lugares de extracci&#243;n o almacenamiento. En este contexto, el objetivo principal de esta tesis es el desarrollo de un modelo termo-hidro-mec&#225;nico (THM) acoplado multifase en un medio poroso fracturado mediante el m&#233;todo de los Elementos Finitos empleando elementos junta de espesor nulo con doble nodo para representar las discontinuidades. Las principales hip&#243;tesis del modelo son: la teor&#237;a de peque&#241;as deformaciones, un sistema compuesto por dos fases fluidas (l&#237;quida y gaseosa), dos especies (agua y gas seco) y una fase s&#243;lida, la fase gaseosa se comporta de acuerdo a la ley de los gases ideales y se considera la evaporaci&#243;n de la fase l&#237;quida. Las variables primarias son: desplazamientos, presiones de fase y temperatura. La formulaci&#243;n contempla: la ecuaci&#243;n de equilibrio, la ecuaci&#243;n de balance de masa de la especie agua, la ecuaci&#243;n de balance de masa de la especie gas y el balance de energ&#237;a. La formulaci&#243;n de las discontinuidades considera las mismas hip&#243;tesis que el medio poroso y toma en cuenta un factor de reducci&#243;n de los par&#225;metros de la curva de retenci&#243;n basado en la apertura mec&#225;nica de la fractura. El modelo ha sido implementado y validado con ejemplos de verificaci&#243;n acad&#233;micos en un c&#243;digo 3D de Elementos Finitos. Sin embargo, durante la fase de validaci&#243;n se han encontrado algunas limitaciones del al modelo, relacionadas con el esquema de integraci&#243;n temporal, en cuanto al tratamiento de los t&#233;rminos de almacenamiento de las ecuaciones de gobierno y los flujos m&#225;sicos. Estas limitaciones han motivado los siguientes nuevos desarrollos: una nueva formulaci&#243;n de conservaci&#243;n de la masa aplicada a ecuaciones de difusi&#243;n en el medio poroso y en las discontinuidades, una nueva curva de retenci&#243;n de tipo exponencial que toma como punto de partida la porosimetr&#237;a en el caso del medio poroso y la distribuci&#243;n de aperturas en las discontinuidades, y, por &#250;ltimo, una nueva ley constitutiva cohesivo-friccional para las juntas que permite la modelaci&#243;n del cierre en descarga.</description>

Biomacromolecules is proud to support efforts toward tackling diseases such as cancers. In this year's iteration of the World Cancer Day Collection (https://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/world-cancer-day-2024), the journal nominated breast cancer-tackling research on hydrogels based on elastin-like recombinamer (ELR) hydrogels as suitable biomaterials to develop more predictive breast cancer models, copolymer nanoparticles from original thermoresponsive block copolymers containing lipid-based segments which demonstrate increased cytotoxicity and apoptosis or necrosis induction in breast cancer cells, as well as immunological studies on biopolymer nonsmall-molecule inhibitor therapeutics. (5&#8722;7) World Microbiome Day 2024The scope of Biomacromolecules covers both naturally occurring biopolymers as well as synthetic polymers introduced to a biological environment. Celebrating World Microbiome Day 2024 (https://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/world-microbiome-day-2024), Biomacromolecules nominated articles showcasing: phage protection during cryopreservation, highlighting that a particular benefit of a polymeric cryopreservation formulation is that the polymers do not function as carbon sources for the phage hosts (bacteria) and hence do not interfere with post-thaw measurements; (8) a comprehensive analysis of the biodegradation of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and chemically modified PHB with different chemical and crystal structures in a soil environment; (9) and wound healing enhanced by a cross-linked macromolecular network based on gelatin loaded with metabolites from Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG that can accelerate wound healing by mitigating infections induced by pathogenic bacteria, accompanied by a reduction in the expression of key proinflammatory cytokines. (10) Peptide Conjugation and DeliveryPeptide conjugation methodology has become crucial in the fields of drug delivery, vaccine development, and biotechnology; from coacervates to nanoparticles, polymer research is driving forward methodology of drug delivery in leaps and bounds.Bioconjugate Chemistry and Biomacromolecules showcased the state of the art in peptide conjugation methodology in a joint Collection (https://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/peptide-delivery). We continue to welcome research at the interface between peptide conjugation and polymer science, focused on improving biocompatibility, stability, and functionality of bioconjugates toward improving therapeutic applications. (11) Some additional featured articles included demonstrations of complex coacervate core micelles as a promising strategy for efficient enzyme delivery systems after increasing the net charge of enzymes through genetic engineering, and cyclic peptide self-assembled nanotubes demonstrated to improve in vitro cell uptake and in vivo pharmacokinetic/biodistribution behavior compared to equivalent covalent molecular bottle-brush polymers. (12,13) 2024 Nobel Prizes in Medicine, Chemistry, and PhysicsFrom microRNAs to artificial intelligence in protein design and prediction, this was an exciting year for those who love biological chemistry. ACS Publications posted two Collections to celebrate both the 2024 Nobel Prize in Medicine (https://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/nobel-prize-medicine-2024), and the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, focused Protein Design and Prediction (https://pubs.acs.org/page/vi/nobel-prize-medicine-2024).Biomacromolecules is delighted to be able to support researchers from across nearly all these prize-winning fields and offered publications to the above Collections on bone regeneration through microRNA-based regulation, as well as computational hydrogel design, and a Perspective on the applications of machine learning to biopolymer data.

(American Chemical Society) This work presents a comprehensive anal. of the biodegrdn. of polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and chem. modified PHB with different chem. and crystal structures in a soil environment. A polymer modification reaction was performed during prepn. of the chem. modified PHB films, utilizing 2,5-dimethyl-2,5-di(tert-butylperoxy)-hexane as a free-radical initiator and maleic anhydride. Films of neat PHB and chem. modified PHB were prepd. by extrusion and thermocompression. The biol. agent employed was natural mixed microflora in the form of garden soil. The course and extent of biodegrdn. of the films was investigated by applying various techniques, as follows: a respirometry test to det. the prodn. of carbon dioxide through microbial degrdn.; SEM (SEM); optical microscopy; fluorescence microscopy; differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Next-generation sequencing was carried out to study the microbial community involved in biodegrdn. of the films. Findings from the respirometry test indicated that biodegrdn. of the extruded and chem. modified PHB followed a multistage (2-3) course, which varied according to the spatial distribution of amorphous and cryst. regions and their spherulitic morphol. SEM and polarized optical microscopy (POM) confirmed that the rate of biodegrdn. depended on the availability of the amorphous phase in the interspherulitic region and the width of the interlamellar region in the first stage, while dependence on the size of spherulites and thickness of spherulitic lamellae was evident in the second stage. X-ray diffraction revealed that orthorhombic &#945;-form crystals with helical chain conformation degraded concurrently with &#946;-form crystals with planar zigzag conformation. The nucleation of PHB crystals after 90 days of biodegrdn. was identified by DSC and POM, a phenomenon which impeded biodegrdn. Fluorescence microscopy evidenced that the crystal structure of PHB affected the physiol. behavior of soil microorganisms in contact with the surfaces of the films. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3sXitVynurjJ&amp;md5=97522dedf8a0320f182edd92109bcfe510Han, Y.; Yin, Z.; Wang, Y.; Jiang, Y.; Chen, J.; Miao, Z.; He, F.; Cheng, R.; Tan, L.; Li, K.

(American Chemical Society) Encapsulation of proteins can have advantages for their protection, stability, and delivery purposes. One of the options to encapsulate proteins is to incorporate them in complex coacervate core micelles (C3Ms). This can easily be achieved by mixing aq. solns. of the protein and an oppositely charged neutral-hydrophilic diblock copolymer. However, protein-contg. C3Ms often suffer from salt-inducible disintegration due to the low charge d. of proteins. The aim of this study is to improve the salt stability of protein-contg. C3Ms by increasing the net charge of the protein by tagging it with a charged polypeptide. As a model protein, we used CotA laccase and generated variants with 10, 20, 30, and 40 glutamic acids attached at the C-terminus of CotA using genetic engineering. Micelles were obtained by mixing the five CotA variants with poly(N-methyl-2-vinyl-pyridinium)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PM2VP128-b-PEO477) at pH 10.8. Hydrodynamic radii of the micelles of approx. 31, 27, and 23 nm for native CotA, CotA-E20, and CotA-E40, resp., were detd. using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). The encapsulation efficiency was not affected using enzymes with a polyglutamic acid tail but resulted in more micelles with a smaller no. of enzyme mols. per micelle. Furthermore, it was shown that the addn. of a polyglutamic acid tail to CotA indeed resulted in improved salt stability of enzyme-contg. C3Ms. Interestingly, the polyglutamic acid CotA variants showed an enhanced enzyme activity. This study demonstrates that increasing the net charge of enzymes through genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve the practical applicability of C3Ms as enzyme delivery systems. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB38Xht1yrsLw%253D&amp;md5=9d2c5ccf68e96917916a97e79653147413Kerr, A.; Sagita, E.; Mansfield, E.

(American Chemical Society) A review. This Perspective outlines recent progress and future directions for using machine learning (ML), a data-driven method, to address crit. questions in the design, synthesis, processing, and characterization of biomacromols. The achievement of these tasks requires the navigation of vast and complex chem. and biol. spaces, difficult to accomplish with reasonable speed. Using modern algorithms and supercomputers, quantum physics methods are able to examine systems contg. a few hundred interacting species and det. the probability of finding them in a particular region of phase space, thereby anticipating their properties. Likewise, modern approaches in chem. and biomol. simulation, supported by high performance computing, have culminated in producing data sets of escalating size and intrinsically high complexity. Hence, using ML to ext. relevant information from these fields is of paramount importance to advance our understanding of chem. and biomol. systems. At the heart of ML approaches lie statistical algorithms, which by evaluating a portion of a given data set, identify, learn, and manipulate the underlying rules that govern the whole data set. The assembly of a quality model to represent the data followed by the predictions and elimination of error sources are the key steps in ML. In addn. to a growing infrastructure of ML tools to address complex problems, an increasing no. of aspects related to our understanding of the fundamental properties of biomacromols. are exposed to ML. These fields, including those residing at the interface of polymer science and biol. (i.e., structure detn., de novo design, folding, and dynamics), strive to adopt and take advantage of the transformative power offered by approaches in the ML domain, which clearly has the potential of accelerating research in the field of biomacromols. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB38XivF2msLY%253D&amp;md5=743ea583851ace62a6511d8fe297fa4bCited By Click to copy section linkSection link copied!This article has not yet been cited by other publications.Download PDFFiguresReferences Get e-AlertsGet e-AlertsBiomacromoleculesCite this: Biomacromolecules 2024, XXXX, XXX, XXX-XXXClick to copy citationCitation copied!https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.4c01672Published December 16, 2024 Publication History Received 29 November 2024Published online 16 December 2024Published 2024 by American Chemical Society.

This study demonstrates that increasing the net charge of enzymes through genetic engineering is a promising strategy to improve the practical applicability of C3Ms as enzyme delivery systems. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB38Xht1yrsLw%253D&amp;md5=9d2c5ccf68e96917916a97e79653147413Kerr, A.; Sagita, E.; Mansfield, E.

(American Chemical Society) A review. This Perspective outlines recent progress and future directions for using machine learning (ML), a data-driven method, to address crit. questions in the design, synthesis, processing, and characterization of biomacromols. The achievement of these tasks requires the navigation of vast and complex chem. and biol. spaces, difficult to accomplish with reasonable speed. Using modern algorithms and supercomputers, quantum physics methods are able to examine systems contg. a few hundred interacting species and det. the probability of finding them in a particular region of phase space, thereby anticipating their properties. Likewise, modern approaches in chem. and biomol. simulation, supported by high performance computing, have culminated in producing data sets of escalating size and intrinsically high complexity. Hence, using ML to ext. relevant information from these fields is of paramount importance to advance our understanding of chem. and biomol. systems. At the heart of ML approaches lie statistical algorithms, which by evaluating a portion of a given data set, identify, learn, and manipulate the underlying rules that govern the whole data set. The assembly of a quality model to represent the data followed by the predictions and elimination of error sources are the key steps in ML. In addn. to a growing infrastructure of ML tools to address complex problems, an increasing no. of aspects related to our understanding of the fundamental properties of biomacromols. are exposed to ML. These fields, including those residing at the interface of polymer science and biol. (i.e., structure detn., de novo design, folding, and dynamics), strive to adopt and take advantage of the transformative power offered by approaches in the ML domain, which clearly has the potential of accelerating research in the field of biomacromols. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB38XivF2msLY%253D&amp;md5=743ea583851ace62a6511d8fe297fa4b</description>
