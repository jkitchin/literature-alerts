                Abstract Silicon-based porous nanocomposites are considered promising as electrode materials for the photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. However, the high cost of raw materials and tedious processing for building nanostructures may not be conducive to large-scale industrial applications in terms of cost. Herein, we would like to introduce a porous structure prepared by Fenton reaction-assisted chemical etching of low-cost commercial silicon powder in the mixed solution of hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen peroxide. These porous particles are further decorated with silver nanoparticles to explore their feasibility for photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. As shown by experimental results, this silicon-based nanocomposite is capable of catalyzing the conversion of carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide. The low cost of commercial silicon powder (~$3000/ton) compared with that of silicon wafers also renders this method potential and feasible for large-scale production of silicon-based porous materials.</description>

      <title>Review article: Application of integrated electrodes materials for enhancing the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide</title>

                Carbon dioxide, a "greenhouse gas" resulted from industrial fossil fuels combustion, is a major driver of global warming and climate change. Several works have been pursued to reduce atmospheric concentrations of CO2. The most attractive and feasible approach to address this issue and maintain sustainable energy development for generations is carbon capture and storage or sequestration (CCS) via electrochemical reduction. Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2R) is an integrated step of CO2 capture and electrochemical CO2 conversion, using water and electricity to convert CO2 into fuels and valuable chemicals, especially formic acid. Multiple benefits of CO2 Electrochemical conversion include the ability to regulate reaction rates or selectivity finely through the applied voltage, modularity of electrolytic cells that allows extensive scalability, and effective integration with intermittent renewable energy sources. The efficiency of ECO2R processes can be improved through (i) electrode structure and modification, (ii) electrolytic cell (reactor), (iii) electrolyte selection and pH control, and (iv) operating conditions (pressure and temperature). However, finding suitable electrodes with high selectivity for formic acid formation remains the biggest challenge at the fundamental level. This article provides an overview of recent research on ECO2R electrodes, focusing on the application of different types of integrated electrodes (e.g., metals, metal oxides, alloys) and the effect of adding promoters or/and carbon supports. The synergistic effect of different materials, promoters, and carbon supports in the electrodes is essential for the enhancement of the ECO2R performance.</description>

      <title>Review electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide into formic acid in various reactors using carbon-based catalyst</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0194299</link>

                Climate change as an effect of global warming is an environmental problem that is currently a concern of many parties. The global warming is mainly triggered by emission of CO2 into the atmosphere due to human activities such as usage of fossil fuels as the energy source. Therefore, the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy as well as technology to capture and utilize the CO2 are highly necessary. The electrochemical conversion of CO2 to produce various products, such as formic acid has advantages, due to mild reaction condition, the process is controllable, use minimal chemicals, and the application is relatively easy to scale-up. Formic acid has potential as a source of hydrogen carrier and can replace fossil-based fuels. Products from electroreduction of CO2 depend on electrons transferred during the reaction, which are generated by the configuration of electrode/electrocatalyst, applied potential, and electrolyte. In addition, the type of reactor system or electrolytic cell also plays an important role in the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Carbon-based materials have potential as electrocatalysts for electroreduction of CO2 because of the porous structure, acid-base resistance, stability at high temperature, abundant availability in nature, and environmentally friendly. This mini review will discuss the electroreduction of CO2 in various electrochemical reactor systems using carbon-based electrocatalyst to produce formic acid using the SWOT analysis method.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Formate Synthesis: Integrating Ethylene Glycol Oxidation with Carbon Dioxide Electrocatalysis Using Redox-Stabilized Earth-Abundant Electrodes</title>

                Carbon dioxide electroreduction (CO2ER) coupled with water oxidation (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) presents a promising solution for effectively mitigating global warming. However, this process is compromised by the sluggish OER, which yields only undesirable O2. Here, we couple selective CO2ER with partial ethylene glycol oxidation (EGO) to concurrently produce formate in both half-reactions. The enhancement of active sites and optimization of formate selectivity are the principal objectives during the design of both electrodes. For CO2ER, redox stabilization of Sn-based cathodes is investigated via Pb doping, thus ultimately improving the Faradaic efficiency from 68% to &#8764;89%. To replace OER with EGO, we employed CuO@Ni(OH)2 on copper foam, reducing the applied potential by 200 mV at 50 mA/cm2. Finally, an EGO-coupled CO2 electrolyzer achieves 10 mA/cm2 at an overall cell voltage 180 mV lower than that of a conventional CO2 electrolyzer. This study showcases the integration of divergent electrochemical processes for concurrent electrosynthesis without precious metals to achieve cost-effective and sustainable formate production from CO2 and plastic waste.</description>

      <title>Accelerated screening of gas diffusion electrodes for carbon dioxide reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-m8dtd</link>

                The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to chemicals and fuels is expected to be a key sustainability technology. Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction technologies are challenged by several factors, including the limited solubility of carbon dioxide in aqueous electrolyte as well as the difficulty in utilizing polymer electrolytes. These considerations have driven systems designs to incorporate gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) to bring the electrocatalyst in contact with both a gaseous reactant/product stream as well as a liquid electrolyte. GDE optimization typically results from manual tuning by select experts. Automated preparation and operation of GDE cells could be a watershed for the systematic study of, and ultimately the development of a materials acceleration platform (MAP) for, catalyst discovery and system optimization. Toward this end, we present the automated GDE (AutoGDE) testing system. Given a catalyst-coated GDE, AutoGDE automates the insertion of the GDE into an electrochemical cell, the liquid and gas handling, the quantification of gaseous reaction products via online mass spectroscopy, and the archiving of the liquid electrolyte for subsequent analysis.</description>

      <title>Synergistic promotion for the performance of photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction by vacancy engineering and N-doped carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2024.127063</link>

                The structural devise of photocatalytic materials are closely related to the separation of photogenerated carriers and the transport of charge, which is crucial to enhance the performance of photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Here, a photocatalyst (CdS-SV@Co@NCNT) has been successfully prepared by growing cadmium sulfide nanoparticles with sulfur vacancies on N-doped carbon nanotubes through a simple solvothermal method. The intrinsic electronic structure is regulated by sulfur vacancies to promote photocatalytic activity. Meanwhile, a larger specific surface area of Co@NCNT could expose more reaction sites and shorten the transfer distance of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, the combination with Co@NCNT could effectively suppress the photocorrosion of CdS. The possible photocatalytic CO2RR path is further speculated by in-situ infrared test results, in which CO2 molecules adsorbed on sulfur vacancies preferentially generate important intermediate COOH*, which is then reduced to CO and CH4. Therefore, it exhibits a high CO yield of 263.3 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 and trace of CH4 while showing excellent stability. This research provides a novel idea for designing the photocatalysts with highly active and stability for CO2RR.</description>

      <title>1 nm Tin Oxide Cluster for the Electrochemical Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Formate at Low Overpotential</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1155/2024/1367542</link>
      <description>Hyungrae Kim, Kang-Hyuk Lee, Chan Woo Lee, International Journal of Energy Research. 2024(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392683413

                Due to its cost-effectiveness and high product selectivity, tin oxide has been regarded as a promising catalyst for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to formate. However, formate production is hindered by the high overpotential; there is a need to reduce the overpotential to enhance energy efficiency and lower electricity cost for the implementation of carbon utilization technology. Here, we report a facile synthesis method for 1 nm-sized SnO2 cluster catalysts, which can be used for CO2-to-formate conversion. SnO2 clusters were prepared through impregnation of porous carbon with a tin precursor solution. The SnO2 clusters showed a low overpotential, generating a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a potential of -0.34 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH. They also achieved high Faradaic efficiencies of 90.5% and 81.5% at 200 and 300 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Their electrocatalytic performance was strongly dependent on the annealing conditions, which affected the particle size, electrochemical active surface area, and metal oxidation state. This paper presents a versatile method for synthesizing metal oxide cluster catalysts, apart from providing insights into the catalytic activity for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to formate.</description>

                The electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CRR, which can convert CO2 into useful compounds at room temperature and ambient pressure by using electricity derived from renewable energy source), has been attracting attention in recent years. This is because it can convert CO2 into useful compounds, which is pertinent to establishing a next&#8208;generation recycling&#8208;oriented energy society. However, further improvement of the electrocatalyst is required to improve its activity, selectivity, and durability. Among these, copper (Cu) can synthesize various hydrocarbons from CO2 and has been the most studied electrocatalyst for the CRR over many years. In particular, regarding ligand&#8208;protected Cu particles for the CRR, the size, shape, and ligands of Cu particles prepared by chemical reduction can be precisely controlled. In this review, we summarize previous research on the size&#8208;dependence of the CRR by using Cu particles (nanoparticles and nanoclusters) prepared by liquid&#8208;phase reduction, and discuss the current status of these studies for researchers on the electrochemical CRR.</description>

                The effect of carbon dioxide on the reaction of bromantane synthesis by reductive amination using carbon monoxide as a reducing agent has been studied. A nonlinear dependence of the yield of the target product on the ratio of gases was observed. It was found that, depending on the conditions, carbon dioxide could both decrease and increase the yield of bromantane.</description>

                This study aims at identifying the carbon dioxide reduction (CDR) potential of large-scale and multi-purpose afforestation/reforestation at the global level with special emphasis on the Mid-Latitude Region (MLR). Applying a combined remote sensing/GIS approach coupled with biophysical forest and disturbance modeling under various climate change scenarios, we identify potential afforestation locations, inter-alia on abandoned agricultural land and on areas burnt from wild land fires. With the help of IIASA&amp;#8217;s biophysical global forestry model (G4M), we calculate the associated land-based CDR potentials through carbon sequestration in afforested biomass and through climate risk-resilient and sustainable forest management dedicated to the supply of bioenergy plants coupled with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) facilities. Finally, three promising scenarios have been identified including I) afforestation; II) reforestation; and III) BECCS. In all scenarios, priority is put on sustainable forest management and nature/biodiversity conservation. Forest modeling results have been combined with recent data sets which have been overlayed in order to provide a unique basis to estimate the land-based CDR technologies&amp;#8217; potential to mitigate climate change and contribute to reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement. In the case of afforestation, preliminary results indicate a total potential afforestation area greater than 1 billion ha. &amp;#160;The largest area potential for afforestation have been identified in the USA. Given the higher productivity (combined with large area available), Brazil is the country with the highest total CDR potential of close to 500 MtC/yr.</description>

                This study evaluates the electrochemical performance of Gd0.1Ce0.9O1.95 (GDC10) cathodes infiltrated with bimetallic Ni-Co and Ni-Cu alloy electrocatalysts for CO2 electroreduction in solid oxide electrolyzer cells (SOECs). The electrochemical reduction performance of SOECs with cathodes infiltrated with Ni-Co and Ni-Cu alloys were compared to the performance of SOECs having cathodes infiltrated with Ni, Co, and Cu. Electrochemical performance was evaluated at 750, 800, and 850&#176;C. Cells with Co, Ni0.50Co0.50, Ni0.75Co0.25, and Ni infiltrated cathodes displayed a relatively similar CO2 electroreduction performance; however, SOECs having Co infiltrated cathodes had a slightly better catalytic performance towards CO2 reduction as demonstrated by their lower polarization resistance (Rp) values of 8.54, 4.03, and 1.25 &#937;&#183;cm2 when measured under open circuit voltage (OCV) at 750, 800, and 850&#176;C, respectively. Cells having Co, Ni0.50Co0.50, Ni0.75Co0.25, and Ni infiltrated cathodes showed a stable long-term CO2 electroreduction performance with Faradaic efficiency values approaching 100% when tested under 0.20 A&#183;cm&#8722;2 for 48 hours and at 750&#176;C. Results indicate that SOECs with Ni infiltrated cathodes possessed better short- and long-term CO2 electroreduction performance compared to SOECs featuring cathodes infiltrated with Cu, Ni0.25Cu0.75, and Ni0.50Cu0.50. Increasing Ni percentage within the Ni-Cu alloy structure had a positive impact on the electrochemical performance as cells with Ni0.50Cu0.50 infiltrated cathodes showed relatively close voltage values to those of cells with Ni infiltrated cathodes during short-term galvanostatic tests. Although the SOEC with Ni0.50Cu0.50 infiltrated cathode experienced performance degradation throughout the long-term test period, it demonstrated better electroreduction performance having Faradaic efficiency values approaching 100% compared to cells with Cu and Ni0.25Cu0.75 infiltrated cathodes when evaluated under 0.20 A&#183;cm&#8722;2 for 48 hours and at 750&#176;C.</description>

      <title>Amorphous ZnSnOx Hollow Spheres Enable Highly Efficient CO2 Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202301694</link>

                Carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorption and electron transport play an important role in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we have demonstrated a new class of diverse hollow ZnSnOx (ZSO) through the amorphization of hydroxides to enhance CO2 adsorption and accelerate electron transport. The amorphization is occurred by calcination process, as indicated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectra. In particular, the ZnSnOx hollow spheres (ZSO HSs) achieve a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of HCOOH up to 92.7% at best, outperforming the commercial ZSO (Comm. ZSO, 83.9%). ZSO HSs also exhibit durable stability with negligible activity decay after 10 h of successive electrolysis. In&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance infrared absorption spectroscopy further reveals strong adsorption of CO2 and rapid intermediate configuration transformation in amorphous ZSO HSs. This work demonstrates the practical application of ZSO for CO2RR and provides a new insight to create efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>CuSnBi Catalyst Grown on Copper Foam by Co-Electrodeposition for Efficient Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 to Formate</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14030191</link>

                Effective electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to formate under mild conditions helps mitigate the energy crisis but requires the use of high-performance catalysts. The addition of a third metal to the binary metal catalyst may further promote the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to formate. Herein, we provided a co-electrodeposition method to grow CuSnBi catalysts on pretreated copper foam and discussed the effects of both pH value and molar ratio of metal ions (Cu2+, Sn2+, and Bi3+) in the electrodeposition solution on the electrocatalytic performance of CO2 to HCOO&#8722;. When the pH value of the electrodeposition solution was 8.5 and the molar ratio of Cu2+, Sn2+, and Bi3+ was 1:1:1, the electrode showed the highest FEHCOO&#8722; of 91.79% and the formate partial current density of 36.6 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.12 VRHE. Furthermore, the electrode kept stable for 20 h at &#8722;1.12 VRHE, and FEHCOO&#8722; was always beyond 85% during the electrolysis process, which is excellent compared to the previously reported ternary metal catalytic electrodes. This work highlights the vital impact of changes (pH value and molar ratio of metal ions) in electrodeposition liquid on catalytic electrodes and their catalytic performance, and refreshing the electrolyte is essential to maintain the activity and selectivity during the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to HCOO&#8722;.</description>

      <title>Introduction of sulfur in Bi2O3 to boost water activation for enhancing the reduction of CO2 to formate</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234298</link>
      <description>Qiuyu Zheng, Sheng Luan, Yun Feng, Shi&#8208;Wen Lv, Yi Zhang, Yanqing Cong, Journal of Power Sources. 601(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392528082

                The reduction of carbon dioxide to produce valuable chemicals offers a sustainable approach towards achieving carbon neutralization. However, the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (ECO2RR) using clean electricity faces challenges in terms of high product faradaic efficiency (FE), current density, and stability. In this study, we prepared a S&#8211;Bi2O3 nanosheets (NS) catalyst through in-situ structural reconstruction. The S&#8211;Bi2O3 NS catalyst exhibited a peak formate FE of 92.05 % at &#8722;0.9 V and a high formate formation rate of 497.80 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;1.3 V. The significant improvement in selectivity and activity is attributed to the sulfur modification on Bi2O3 NS catalyst. The sulfur doping enhances the dissociation of water into H* species, facilitating the formation of HCOO* intermediate and promoting formate production. This work presents a simple and effective strategy for developing highly selective Bi-based electrocatalysts for efficient formate production.</description>

      <title>Transformational Sorbent Materials for a Substantial Reduction in the Energy&amp;#x0D; Requirement for Direct Air Capture of CO2</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2172/2315076</link>

                InnoSepra&#8217;s project, &#8220;Transformational Sorbent Materials for a Substantial Reduction in the Energy Requirement for Direct Air Capture of CO2,&#8221; utilized computational tools, materials characterization, and lab scale testing to optimize previously identified materials to determine their performance under direct air capture conditions. InnoSepra utilized the test results to determine the energy required for regeneration and to develop a high-level process design/analysis to demonstrate the application of developed materials for direct air capture which could be utilized for future techno-economic and life-cycle analyses to fully assess the potential of the materials for direct air capture. InnoSepra also updated the State Point Data Table and completed the environmental, health, and safety (EH&amp;S) Risk Assessment. The overall objective of this project was to demonstrate that the proposed transformational materials can lead to a substantial reduction in the energy requirement for direct capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) from air compared to current state-of-the-art direct air capture processes. An assessment of the production of large quantities of the proposed materials was made for a potential future commercial implementation of these materials for direct air capture. The ultimate goals of the Project were to confirm the expected performance at the lab scale and to provide sufficient data to enable the development of a preliminary technical analysis to confirm the projected energy savings of at least 50% compared to current state-of-the-art technologies for direct air capture based on absorption and adsorption. During the project execution, InnoSepra demonstrated that Direct Air Capture with physical sorbents developed/identified during this project has the potential for a significant reduction in the energy required for capture and, when fully developed, the technology has the potential for an energy requirement below 4 GJ/MT of CO2. The starting TRL for major unit operations, moisture removal, and CO2 capture, was 2, and the end of the project TRL for these unit operations was 3-4. The technology uses near-commercial sorbents and the production of these materials for commercial-scale demonstration can be done in 2-3 years. The materials also have a long life (&gt;5 years) and pose little or no EH&amp;S issues.</description>
