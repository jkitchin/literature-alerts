                Abstract High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) exhibit distinctive catalytic properties owing to their diverse elemental compositions, garnering considerable attention across various applications. However, the preparation of HEO nanoparticles with different spatial structures remains challenging due to their inherent structural instability. Herein, ultrasmall high&#8208;entropy oxide nanoparticles (less than 5 nm) with different spatial structures are synthesized on carbon supports via the rapid thermal shock treatment. The low&#8208;symmetry HEO, BiSbInCdSn&#8208;O 4 , demonstrates exceptional performance for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reaction (eCO 2 RR), including a lower overpotential, high Faraday efficiency across a wide electrochemical range (&#8722;0.3 to &#8722;1.6 V), and sustained stability for over100 h. In the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, BiSbInCdSn&#8208;O 4 achieves a current density of 350 mA cm &#8722;2 while maintaining good stability for 24 h. Both experimental observations and theoretical calculations reveal that the electron donor&#8211;acceptor interactions between bismuth and indium sites in BiSbInCdSn&#8208;O 4 enable the electron delocalization to facilitate the efficient adsorption of CO 2 and hydrogenation reactions. Thus, the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step is reduced to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability. This study elucidates that the spatial structure of metal sites in HEOs is able to regulate CO 2 adsorption status for eCO 2 RR, paving the way for the rational design of efficient HEO catalysts.</description>

      <title>Highly selective conversion of carbon dioxide to methane by copper single atom electrocatalysts</title>

                Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction into high&#8208;value chemicals is one of the important solutions to the greenhouse effect and energy crisis. However, the slow kinetic process of eight electrons requires the development of efficient catalysts to improve the yields. Single atom catalysts (SACs) with high activity and selectivity have become an emerging research frontier in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Herein, a catalyst comprised of Cu single atoms loaded on carbon substrate (Cu&#8208;NC) is developed for highly selective electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane (CH4). The optimal catalyst (Cu&#8208;NC&#8208;1&#8208;4) exhibits a faradaic efficiency (FE) of over 50% for CH4 within a wide potential window from &#8208;1.3 V to &#8208;1.8 V (vs. RHE) and the highest FE of CH4 is up to 67.22% at &#8208;1.6 V (vs. RHE). Meanwhile, the product selectivity of CH4 among all the carbon products reaches 93.00%, and the activity decay can be negligible via the 70&#8208;hour&#8208;stability&#8208;test. The existence of atomic dispersed Cu&#8208;N3 sites was verified by high&#8208;angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) and X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the effective adsorption of the key intermediate *CO on Cu&#8208;N3 sites prompts the generation of CH4.</description>

      <title>A Strongly Coupled Metal/Hydroxide Heterostructure Cascades Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate Reduction Reactions toward Efficient Urea Electrosynthesis</title>

                The direct coupling of nitrate ions and carbon dioxide for urea synthesis presents an appealing alternative to the Bosch-Meiser process in industry. The simultaneous activation of carbon dioxide and nitrate, however, as well as efficient C-N coupling on single active site, poses significant challenges. Here, we propose a novel metal/hydroxide heterostructure strategy based on synthesizing an Ag-CuNi(OH)2 composite to cascade carbon dioxide and nitrate reduction reactions for urea electrosynthesis. The strongly coupled metal/hydroxide heterostructure interface integrates two distinct sites for carbon dioxide and nitrate activation, and facilitates the coupling of *CO (on silver, where * denotes an active site) and *NH2 (on hydroxide) for urea formation. Moreover, the strongly coupled interface optimizes the water splitting process and facilitates the supply of active hydrogen atoms, thereby expediting the deoxyreduction processes essential for urea formation. Consequently, our Ag-CuNi(OH)2 composite delivers a high urea yield rate of 25.6 mmol gcat.-1 h-1 and high urea Faradaic efficiency of 46.1%, as well as excellent cycling stability. This work provides new insights into the design of dual-site catalysts for C-N coupling, considering their role on the interface.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Salts on the CO2 Reduction Product Distribution in an Aprotic Electrolyte</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cphc.202400589</link>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction in non&#8208;aqueous solvents is promising due to the increased CO2 solubility of organic&#8208;based electrolytes compared to aqueous electrolytes. Here the effect of nine different salts in propylene carbonate (PC) on the CO2 reduction product distribution of polycrystalline Cu is investigated. Three different cations (tetraethylammonium (TEA), tetrabutylammonium (TBA), and tetrahexylammonium (THA)) and three different anions (chloride (Cl), tetrafluoroborate (BF4), and hexafluorophosphate (PF6)) were used. Chronoamperometry and in&#8208;situ FTIR measurements show that the size of the cation has a crucial role in the selectivity. A more hydrophobic surface is obtained when employing a larger cation with a weaker hydration shell. This stabilizes the CO2&#8208;&#183; radical and promotes the formation of ethylene. CO2 reduction in 0.7 M THACl/PC shows the highest hydrocarbon formation. Lastly, we hypothesize that the hydrocarbon formation pathway is not through C&#8208;C coupling, as the CO solubility in PC is very high, but through the dimerization of the COH intermediate.</description>

                Electrochemical water splitting and CO2 reduction are important processes to produce hydrogen and low&#8211;carbon fuels as renewable energy sources. Here, nanostructured MnMoO4, prepared by the reflux precipitation method, was investigated as a trifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting and CO2 reduction reactions. Using a combination of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results, a direct band gap of 3.05 eV was obtained experimentally for the prepared MnMoO4. An overpotential of 0.36 V at a current density of 5 mA cm-2 and a Tafel slope of 58 mV dec-1 were obtained for the oxygen evolution reaction. At a current density of 3 mA cm-2, overpotentials of 0.39 V and 0.58 V were achieved in the absence and presence of CO2 bubbling into a 0.1 M KOH solution, respectively, emphasizing the poisoning effect of CO2 reduction intermediates for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Based on the obtained results, MnMoO4 could be a promising electrocatalyst for water splitting and CO2 reduction reactions.</description>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECR) is a promising pathway to producing valuable chemicals and fuels. Despite extensive studies reported, improving CO2 adsorption for local CO2 enrichment or water dissociation to generate sufficient H* is still not enough to achieve industrial&#8208;relevant current densities. Herein, we report a &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; catalyst, defective Bi nanosheets modified by CrOx (Bi&#8208;CrOx), to simultaneously promote CO2 adsorption and water dissociation, thereby enhancing the activity and selectivity of ECR to formate. The Bi&#8208;CrOx exhibits an excellent Faradic efficiency (&#8776; 100 %) in a wide potential range from &#8210;0.4 to &#8210;0.9 V. In addition, it achieves a remarkable formate partial current density of 687 mA cm&#8210;2 at a moderate potential of &#8210;0.9 V without iR compensation, the highest value at &#8210;0.9 V reported so far. Control experiments and theoretical simulations revealed that the defective Bi facilitates CO2 adsorption/activation while the CrOx accounts for enhancing the protonation process via accelerating H2O dissociation. This work presents a pathway to boosting formate production through tuning CO2 and H2O species at the same time.</description>

      <title>Structure Sensitivity and Catalyst Restructuring for CO2 Electro-reduction on Copper</title>

                Cu is the most promising metal catalyst for CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to multi-carbon products, but the structure sensitivity of the reaction and the stability versus restructuring of the catalyst surface under reaction conditions are still controversial. Here, atomic scale simulations of surface energies and reaction pathway kinetics supported by experimental evidence unveil that CO2RR does not take place on perfect planar Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces but rather on steps or kinks defects, and that these planar surfaces tend to restructure in reaction conditions to the active stepped surfaces. By combining basin hopping global sampling and grand canonical density functional theory, we show that the extremely low CO coverage on (111) and (100) surfaces, originating from sluggish CO2 conversion and unfavorable CO binding, limits the ability of these surfaces to reduce CO2 to multi-carbon products. Steps and kinks at surfaces, despite the lack of decrease in C-C coupling barriers on these sites, exhibit a significant increase in activity arising from beneficial CO2 activation and higher CO coverage. Notably, the square motifs adjacent to defects, not the defects themselves, are the active sites for CO2RR via synergistic effect. In addition, the strong binding of CO on defective sites acts as a thermodynamic driving force for the restructuring of planar surfaces to active stepped terminations under reactive conditions. We evaluate these mechanisms against experiments of CO2RR on UHV-prepared ultraclean Cu surfaces. Overall, our findings highlight the structural sensitivity in steering CO2RR and elucidate the origin of in situ restructuring of Cu catalysts during the reaction. We furthermore feature that the active sites for CO2RR are created under reaction conditions.</description>

                Atomically precise copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) exhibit significant potential as catalysts for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. However, the range of products achievable with these NCs has been somewhat constrained. This study introduces an innovative design strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of Cu NCs by engineering their active sites. We achieve this by creating defects on a cubic Cu58 NC through the partial dislocation of Cu atoms at its vertices, leading to the ligand vacancies that exposes multiple Cu sites. Additionally, the dislocation of Cu atoms finely tunes the inner cationic geometries through altered cuprophilic interactions, resulting in discernable changes in their edges and vertices. When tested, these unique arrangements of Cu(I) atoms within the cluster prove effective in determining product specificities during electrochemical CO2 reduction. Density functional theory calculations correlate the product selectivity toward CH3OH for [Cu58H20(SPr)36(PPh3)7]2+ (Pr = CH2CH2CH3) NC to the enhanced edge Cu reactivity in binding CO and CHO intermediates, compared to [Cu58H20(SPr)36(PPh3)8]2+ and [Cu58H20(SEt)36(PPh3)6]2+ (Et = CH2CH3) NCs. This work underscores the potential of tailored structural designs of atomically precise nanocatalysts in steering electrochemical CO2 reduction toward unconventional products.</description>

                Although gapped grain boundaries have often been observed in bulk and nanosized materials, and their crucial roles in some physical and chemical processes have been confirmed, their acquisition at ultrasmall nanoscale presents a significant challenge. To date, they had not been reported in metal nanoparticles smaller than 2 nm owing to the difficulty in characterization and the high instability of grain boundary (GB) atoms. Herein, we have successfully developed a synthesis method for producing a novel chiral nanocluster Au78(TBBT)40 (TBBT = 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylphenylthiol) with a 26&#8208;atom gapped and rotated GB. This nanocluster was precisely characterized using single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray crystallography and mass spectrometry. Additionally, an offset atomic defect linked to the peripheral Au(TBBT)2 staple was found in the structure. Comparing it to similarly face&#8208;centered cubic&#8208;structured Au36(TBBT)24, Au44(TBBT)28, Au52(TBBT)32, Au92(TBBT)44, and ~5 nm nanocrystals, the bridging Au78(TBBT)40 nanocluster exhibits higher catalytic activity in the reduction of CO2 to CO. This enhanced activity is well interpreted using density functional theory calculations and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, highlighting the influence of GBs and point defects on the properties of metal nanoclusters.</description>

      <title>Carbonated Water for Acceleration of Oil Production, Reduction of Water Production and Improvement of CO2-Storage Capacity</title>

                Carbon Dioxide (CO2) capture, storage and its utilization can be used to decrease Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions (Hong 2022). Alteration of the wettability of oil reservoirs has the potential to improve the oil recovery (Sheng, 2010). Wettability is defined the tendency of a fluid to adhere to a solid surface in the presence of other immiscible fluids (Craig, 1971). In multiphase flow in oil reservoirs, wettability is important for phase distribution and flow properties. In fractured reservoirs, wettability alteration will improve the spontaneous imbibition of water and thereby improve the oil recovery (Sheng, 2010; Fjelde and Asen, 2009). In spontaneous imbibition experiments, carbonated water (CW, water saturated with CO2) at oil reservoir conditions has been found to improve the spontaneous imbibition of water in fractured chalk models and improve the oil production (Fjelde et al., 2011). Sandstone rocks can also contain carbonate minerals (e.g. Pan et al., 2016). In addition, clay minerals in sandstone rocks are often more oil-wet than the other non-carbonate minerals. The surface area of clay minerals can be high in sandstone rocks, and these surfaces are very important for the wettability on core scale and reservoir scale. The flow properties in oil reservoirs depends on the saturation functions (relative permeability and capillary pressure) (Dake, 1978). Mineral composition and mineral distribution will together with the fluid compositions and conditions (temperature, pressure) determine these functions. Alteration of wettability for non-fractured oil reservoirs to more water-wet has also the potential to accelerate the oil production due to improvement of the relative permeability of oil (Collins and Melrose, 1983; Clementz 1976; 1977; 1982; Lager et al., 2007). Alteration of the wettability to more water-wet may have the potential to reduce the mobility ratio and thereby improve the volumetric sweep of the reservoir. The water production will be less at more water-wet conditions, because the relative permeability of water is low and higher volumetric sweep efficiency will the delay the water breakthrough. Alteration of wettability to more water-wet will therefore reduce the water production. Increase in relative permeability for oil and decrease in the relative permeability for water will give a shorter production period. Shorter production period and less water production will also reduce the environmental impact. Surface Complexation Modeling (SCM) with the geochemistry solver, PHREEQC has been used to estimate the wettability preferences of the minerals and rocks (Mehdiyev et al. 2022). The wettability preferences were estimated by calculating Bond Products defined as the product of the mole fraction of oppositely charged oil and mineral surfaces. It was shown that the SCM technique can predict the tendency for wettability alteration of the individual minerals and reservoir rocks during injection of CW using the different rock, brine and Stock Tank Oil (STO) compositions.</description>

                A three-compartment electrolyzer has been developed for the electro-reduction of CO2 to CO in an organic electrolyte, with NaOH and Cl2 produced as byproducts. In order to improve the performance of the electrolyzer, we have prepared an Au/Cu alloy electrode using a novel non-cyanide electroplating method with high porosity. By expanding the specific surface area of the cathode, and providing a large number of active sites for CO2 electro-reduction, the cathodic current density reaches to 92.7 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, and the Faradaic efficiency of CO formation remains stable at 94.0 %. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations analysis identified that alloying tune the electronic structure of the Au and Cu surface, resulting in promoting the activation of CO2.</description>

      <title>External Photosensitizer Free Function-Integrated Cu(II)-Complex Catalyzed Photo Driven CO2 Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-vrv83</link>
      <description>Soumadip Das, Aritra Roy, Navonil Chakrabarti, Narottam Mukhopadhyay, Aniruddha Sarkar, Sayam Sen Gupta, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402134791

                Developing a function-integrated catalyst from earth-abundant elements, capable of efficient light harvesting and electron transfer, is crucial for enhancing the efficacy of CO2 transformation, a critical step in environmental cleanup and advancing clean energy prospects. Traditional approaches relying on external photosensitizers, comprising of 4d/5d metal complexes, often face challenges in intermolecular electron transfer, and attachment of photosensitizing arms to the catalyst increases dependency on intramolecular electron transfer kinetics, underscoring the need for a more integrated solution. We report a new Cu(II) complex, K[CuNDPA] (1[K(18-crown-6)]), bearing a dipyrrin amide-based trianionic tetradentate ligand, NDPA (H3L), which is capable of harnessing light energy, despite having a paramagnetic Cu(II) center, without any external photosensitizer and photocatalytically reducing CO2 to CO in acetonitrile: water (19:1 v/v) with a TON as high as 1132, a TOF of 566 h-1 and a selectivity of 99%. This complex also shows hemilability in the presence of water, which not only plays a role in a proton relay mechanism but also helps stabilize a crucial Cu(I)-NDPA intermediate. The hemilability was justified by the formation of N3O (2) and N2O2 (3) coordinated congeners of the N4 bound complex 1. The overall mechanism was further investigated via spectroscopic techniques like EPR, UV-vis, and Spectroelectrochemistry, culminating in the justification of a single electron-reduced Cu(I)NDPA species as a proposed intermediate. In the next step, the binding of CO2 to Cu(I) complex and subsequent electron transfer to form Cu(II)-CO2&#8226;&#8254; was indirectly probed by a radical trapping experiment via the addition of p-methoxy-2,6-ditertbutylphenol that led to the formation of a phenoxyl radical. This work opens new strategies for designing earth-abundant robust molecular catalysts that can function as photocatalysts without the aid of any external photosensitizers.</description>

                Abstract Bioelectrochemical synthesis is emerging as an eco-friendly method for CO2 fixation. These systems typically rely on electrochemically regenerated NAD(P)H to provide the necessary reducing equivalents for formate dehydrogenase (FDH) to convert CO2 into formate. However, the efficiency of these systems is currently unsatisfactory due to the unfavorable dynamics of the CO2-to-formate conversion by FDH. In this study, we developed a one-pot cooperative bioelectrochemical system featuring a rhodium-based catalyst [Cp*Rh(bpy)Cl]2+ (RhIII-complex or [RhIII-H2O]2+) working cooperatively with enzymatic cascades of acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS), acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ACDH), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), formolase (FLS), and d-fructose-6-phosphate aldolase mutant FSAA129S to convert CO2 into several C2+ chemicals. The bifunctional RhIII-complex concurrently catalyzes the reduction of CO2 to formate at a rate of 15.8 mM/h and NADH regeneration at a rate of 0.24 mM/min. The formation of formate is 83.2 times faster than using one of the best aerobic FDH from Clostridium ljungdahlii (ClFDH), resulting in a 3.6 times enhanced methanol production rate of 0.43 mM/h in the bioelectroenzymatic system (RhIII-complex-ACS-ACDH-ADH) compared to that of 0.12 mM/h in tandem enzymatic system (ClFDH-ACS-ACDH-ADH). Bifunctional RhIII-complex also works cooperatively with tandem enzymatic cascades to produce dihydroxyacetone (C3) and L-erythrulose (C4) at the yield of 2.63 mM, and 1.93 mM, respectively. This study leveraged the synthetic capabilities of both electrochemical catalysis and enzymatic catalysis, offering an alternative for electroenzymatic CO2 reduction to yield value-added compounds with enhanced productivity.</description>

                Climate warming has become a global environmental problem, more and more governments and people's attention. At present, most scientists generally agree that carbon dioxide released by human activities is the most important greenhouse gas causing global warming. Reducing carbon dioxide emissions from coal burning is an important measure to reduce global warming. This paper analyzes the significance of CCUS and CO2 transport, explores the CO2 transport mode, studies and discusses the methodological issues, and summarizes the types of CO2 emission reduction technologies.</description>

                It is important to improve the separation ability of photogenerated electrons and the adsorption capacity of carbon dioxide (CO2) for efficient photoreduction of CO2. Here, we synthesized ZnCdS quantum dots (ZCS-QDs) and cerium dioxide nanosheets (CeO2) using the solvothermal method and calcination method. We combined CeO2 and ZCS-QDs to effectively enhance the charge separation efficiency, and the lifetime of photogenerated electrons was increased 4.5 times. The CO evolution rate of the optimized composite (ZCS-QDs/CeO2) was up to 495.8 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, and it had 100% product selectivity. In addition, the stability remained high after five cycles. The CO2 adsorption capacity of the catalyst surface was observed by in situ FTIR. The test results showed that improving CO2 capture ability and promoting photogenic electron separation had positive effects on enhancing photoreduction of CO2. This study provides a reference for constructing a zero-dimensional&#8211;two-dimensional (0D&#8211;2D) heterojunction and explores potential CO2 reduction reaction mechanisms.</description>

                This study introduces a novel multi-objective model that addresses emission costs, large-scale user operational expenses, and the efficiency of the electric storage system within an integrated energy hub encompassing heating, water, power, and gas sources. A key objective of this model is to maximize the performance of the electrical storage system. The study employs the epsilon-constraint method to construct the Pareto front, aiming to balance profitability and emission reduction from virtual power plant units. The final decision-making process utilizes a fuzzy decision-making technique. Additionally, demand response program (DRP) is incorporated to optimize peak-hour demand and align the load profile with defined objectives. The proposed approach is evaluated across various operational scenarios within a sample system, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential benefits in terms of cost reduction and environmental impact mitigation. Focusing on environmental impact, the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are also lower under the DRP scenario, amounting to 10253.92 kg without DRP versus 10127.74 kg with DRP. This reduction in emissions aligns with sustainable energy management goals, showcasing DRP's capability to mitigate environmental impacts associated with energy generation and consumption. The percentage improvements in total costs and emissions further highlight the advantages of employing DRP. The reductions in total costs range from approximately 1.2%&#8211;1.4%, demonstrating cost savings across different cost categories. Similarly, the decrease in CO2 emissions by approximately 1.2% underscores DRP's role in promoting environmentally friendly energy practices.</description>

                Indonesia signed the Paris Agreement in 2016, thus actively contributing to tackling climate change has an obligation to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The main factor of global climate change is the increase of GHG, especially carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). PT X is committed to supporting Net Zero Emission 2060 by encouraging programs that have a good impact on the environment and Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's) 13 and supporting the government in handling the climate crisis. The ranking of alternatives is carried out using two structured methods, quantitative analysis using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), considering environmental, economic, and social aspects. used to help make decisions for the implementation of carbon mitigation mechanisms. From the observation of the previous implementation, carbon emissions in the production process were quite high. So it is necessary to make effective carbon mitigation efforts. There are three criteria that influence action decisions, namely environmental criteria, economic criteria and social criteria. The results of the weight value of each criterion are that the environment has the highest weight (0.61), followed by economic criteria (0.20) and social criteria (0.19) from these values indicate that environmental criteria are the most important criteria in decision making. The ranking results show that the Piston Modification Program and the Diesel Engine to Gas Engine Replacement Program are optimal options for short-term implementation. The Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) program should be considered for long-term investment, with the potential for large emission reductions and long-term cost savings.</description>

      <title>Small States, Big Impact: A Review of Rising Greenhouse Gases Emission from the Energy Sector in India</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3233/jcc240022</link>

                Emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) are a prime concern that needs our attention, not only in megapolitan states but also in developing small states. The increase in GHGs-emission could lead to severe climate change scenarios and global warming. In India, it is measured that the energy sector (68.7%) accounts for a significant GHGs-emission, followed by agriculture (19.6%), industry (6.0%), land use change and forestry (3.8%), and waste sector (1.9%). This article aims to investigate temporal changes and trends in greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions in the energy sector of India. We have used GHGs-emission as Carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent and compared the top per capita emitting states versus their total emissions and vice versa. Most of this increase has occurred in small states, where urbanisation, population growth, and economic expansion have been significant factors. Odisha and Maharashtra were listed as top-emitting states releasing more than 240 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e), mainly through industrial energy and electricity-related emissions, respectively, followed by Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal. In contrast, Chhattisgarh was recorded as the top per-capita emitting state, followed by Odisha. Among all the states studied, Lakshadweep has shown a significant trend in GHGs per capita reduction, while the other shows an increasing trend due to a lack of robust and effective legislation. This review will help to seek the attention of policymakers and the government towards the increasing emissions from the small states which are emerging in day to day life.</description>

      <title>Hydrocarbons, Hydrogen, and Organic Acids Generation by Ball Milling and Batch Incubation of Sedimentary Rocks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2024.106160</link>
      <description>Alexander Arthur Haluska, Eva Blendinger, Hermann R&#252;gner, Daniel B&#252;chner, Jan&#8208;Peter Duda, Volker Thiel, M. Blumenberg, Christian Ostertag-Henning, Steffen K&#252;mmel, Peter Grathwohl, Applied Geochemistry. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402183828

                Pulverized rock samples are widely used in laboratory experiments, e.g., to assess microbial or abiotic processes in batch incubation tests. However, it is unclear if ball-milled samples accurately reflect in-situ conditions and if observed processes are affected by by-products artificially generated during the sample preparation procedure. As such, this study examined the effects of dry ball milling on the release of gases, which include C1-C4 hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen (H2), and low molecular weight organic acids (LMWOAs) from different sedimentary rocks. The experiments involved pulverization using a gas-tight zirconium oxide planetary ball mill followed by wet and dry batch incubation and thermal desorption up to 200 o C. During milling, all sedimentary rocks, except a low organic carbon sandstone sample, yielded methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), butane (C4H10), H2, CO2, and unsaturated hydrocarbons, e.g., ethene (C2H4). Sandstones only yielded H2, CH4, and CO2. Stable carbon isotope signatures of these products are similar to thermogenic gases. The gases were also detected in subsequent wet incubation experiments (after gases from milling had been removed). Additionally, formate, acetate, and citrate, were detected in all samples except for sandstone. Pyruvate, malate, and succinate were also detected in some samples. Thermal desorption products of powdered limestone, shale, and pyrite concretion samples included organic acids, such as acetate and formate, which were higher in milled samples than in crushed particles (&#8764;1 mm). The original geological thermal maturity of the studied sedimentary rock samples was low (below "oil window") and, thus, considerably below "gas window", suggesting that most of the detected gases were generated during ball milling. H2 generated during ball milling may be derived from the reduction of water from fluid inclusion or phyllosilicates, involving the formation of reactive mineral surfaces or radicals. Notably, the concentrations of gaseous hydrocarbons derived from milling are relatively high and comparable to "wet" gases. At the same time, these data indicate that substantial amounts of gases and LWMOAs might be artificially generated during laboratory batch experiments with milled samples. Hence, ball milled rock samples must be used with caution if assessing (bio-)geochemical processes for natural environments.</description>

      <title>Integration of fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag into palm oil fuel ash based geopolymer concrete: a review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54113/j.sust.2024.000050</link>
      <description>Ying Yi Tan, Hanizam Awang, Noor Haida Mohd Kaus, Sustainable Structures. 4(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402226535

                The construction industry significantly depends on concrete due to its mechanical attributes and economy efficiency. The increase demand for building materials, particularly concrete, has resulted in overproduction of ordinary portland cement (OPC) and consequent significant release of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. For addressing these issues, alternative innovative and sustainable materials, such as geopolymer concrete, which utilised waste materials as binding agents have been introduced, leading to a reduction in CO2 emissions. Palm oil fuel ash (POFA) contains abundant silicates and aluminates, making it well-suited for use as binder in geopolymer concrete. On the other hand, POFA geopolymer concrete with high volume exhibits reduced early strength development, decreased workability, and an extended setting time. Therefore, this review paper emphasizes the need of including fly ash (FA) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) into POFA-based geopolymer concrete. A notable result of the review is that the inclusion of aluminium oxide and iron (III) oxide in FA improves the chloride binding capability, resulting to a dense microstructure with high strength. In addition, the presence of calcium oxide in FA and GGBS enhances the creation of C-S-H, N-A-S-H, and C-A-S-H gels, resulting in a decrease in porosity and an enhancement of the fresh and mechanical characteristics. Furthermore, the use of FA improves the insulation and thermal efficiency of the geopolymer concrete. Therefore, integration of FA and GGBS in POFA geopolymer may enhanced the mechanical and durability qualities. Further study is required to optimize the composition of POFA, FA and GGBS in the mix, and researching new, cost-effective alkaline activators obtained from waste products offers another avenue for boosting the efficiency of geopolymer synthesis.</description>

                Solving the world-class problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere and potential utilization of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), the article provides an overview of technologies for injecting CO 2 into the oil and gas reservoirs to enhance oil recovery and stimulate oil production. Two main methods of carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) injection are proposed and described in detail. These are the Huff and Puff method, which involves the injection of CO&#8322; into production wells, and CO&#8322; injection into injection wells. The technology of injecting carbon dioxide into production wells has a number of advantages, such as the lack of capital costs and low operating costs, quick effect manifested in increased oil rates and efficient use of CO 2 . The general principle of the technology is the controlled supply of carbon dioxide through the mouth of a shut-in production well into the bottomhole formation zone. The efficiency of the technology is achieved primarily through the reduction of oil viscosity and volumetric expansion of oil, the decrease of interfacial tension, and the reduction of relative phase permeability by water. Consequently, residual oil saturation is reduced by the increase in the amount of trapped gas. The second technology for injecting carbon dioxide into injection wells to achieve a positive technological effect requires a larger volume of injection agent and a longer period for evaluation of the effect. The efficiency of the technology and the increase in the oil displacement ratio are achieved through the distribution of large volumes of injected carbon dioxide through low-permeability reservoir channels and involvement of residual oil. The article presents the necessary conditions and main stages of CO 2 injection process organization using the proposed technologies, and describes the composition of the required equipment. Special attention is paid to the necessity of using inhibitors to protect downhole equipment, as well as to the selection of suitable inhibitors, taking into account their physical and chemical characteristics, compatibility with other reagents and reservoir properties. The authors of the article have conducted an expert survey of the market for the availability of specialized equipment in Russia and the services of domestic manufacturers in the field of gas injection technologies. The conclusion of the article highlights the importance of CO 2 injection careful planning and monitoring, as well as the potential of gas-enhanced methods to improve production and reduce environmental impact.</description>

      <title>Carbon Sequestration Through Forestry: A Differential Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.58496/bjm/2023/017</link>
      <description>Shahreen Kasim, Mona Ghassan Younis, Deleted Journal. 2023(None)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4402209479

                Carbon sequestration through forestry represents a promising approach to partially counteract anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change. Tree growth naturally removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, storing it as biomass. Sustainably managed forests can effectively function as carbon sinks. However, determining optimal forestry policies involves balancing complex ecological dynamics with economic constraints. This study develops differential equation models quantitatively capturing forest growth, timber harvesting, and carbon sequestration dynamics. Logistic models are first adapted to simulate biomass accumulation of representative tree species. Lifecycle growth patterns spanning juvenile to mature phases are incorporated, along with climate effects. Biomass levels are proportionally related to carbon dioxide removal rates from the atmosphere. Deforestation impacts are analyzed by incorporating harvesting-induced biomass reductions. Sustainability constraints are implemented to ensure minimum viable tree densities across harvest rotations. Optimization techniques then identify management guidelines maximizing economic returns given ecological stability considerations. The goal is providing quantitative insights into rotation lengths, planting densities, and allowable cuts upholding both climate change mitigation and commercial demands. Findings can inform science-based forestry policies to leverage forests as sustainable natural carbon sinks.</description>

      <title>Carbon Dioxide Absorption And Channelling In Closed Circuit Rebreather Scrubbers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.34719/conf8104</link>
      <description>Shona Cunningham, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402232145

                "Closed Circuit Rebreathers (CCRs) are a type of Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA) used predominantly by the diving community. CCR technologies have become prevalent within the commercial, military and technical diving communities over recent years. CCRs work by recycling breathing gas, by-passing the gas through a carbon dioxide (CO2)chemical scrubber and topping the resultant scrubbed gas up with pure oxygen to maintain the oxygen content at a level which supports life. One of the main dangers currently faced by divers using this equipment is the risk of CO2 poisoning if the scrubber fails. This failure occurs due to CO2 breakthrough - where breakthrough is defined as the time until the canister effluent passes through the chemical absorbent unscrubbed. There are a variety of reasons for CO2 breakthrough, and not all of the reasons can be identified by the operator. A better understanding of CO2 absorption within CCRs would lead to a reduction in failures. There are a variety of potential causes of CO2 breakthrough, where breakthrough is defined as the time until the canister effluent passes through the chemical absorbent unscrubbed. Not all of the causes can be compensated for by the operator. A transient computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model investigating the kinetics of flow and CO2 absorption focusing on the chemical reaction between the absorbent soda lime and CO2 is presented in the thesis. It presents the first reported mixture model theory simulation of the CCR scrubber using Ansys CFX 13.0. An extensive review of the design of CCRs, their applications and current modelling techniques identified a need to enhance the simulation of CCRs using the mixture model theory to simulate the chemical reactions occurring within the scrubber system of the CCR. The application of CFD techniques on CCRs allows the in depth analysis of the reaction between soda lime and CO2 using the graphical display provided by the simulated model. The simulation studies undertaken present a transient model with the ability to investigate seven key parameters affecting scrubber performance; geometry, wall temperature, inlet velocity, pressure, CO2 absorption, granule size and material selection. Analyses of the results demonstrate the sensitivity of the parameters to their behaviour on CO2 breakthrough. Due to the requirement of strong coupling between the phases of CO2 and soda lime, the mixture model is the best suited model for the liquid-particle mixture. Analysis of mesh size, mesh type and inflation are made to independently characterise the accuracy of the presented model by means of convergence before further comparisons with experimental data. The importance of mesh refinement is demonstrated as well as the contribution of inflation and grid independence to the accuracy of the model. A versatile model simulating chemical reactions within a CCR canister for different geometrical scrubber designs has been shown to be capable of analysing the design parameters of interest. A CCR scrubber model will bring new learning into the kinetics of CO2 absorption. It may also further the technology of monitoring scrubber duration in real time for a user. Data collected from a user may be fed into the system to allow a visual analysis of the scrubber. The first section of this thesis describes the operational requirements of the CCR system and in order to validate the CFD model, an experimental program was designed where an experimental test rig was manufactured to undertake experiments to study the impact of CO2 breakthrough of various parameters. The system incorporated CO2, O2, humidity and temperature sensors where the rig tested the scrubber&#8217;s capacity to absorb CO2 which is pumped in a controlled environment to benchmark the initial designs against existing literature. A review of the state of the art identified five feasible parameters important to scrubber kinetics; (i) geometry, (ii) material selection, (iii) inlet gas velocity, (iv) granule size and (v) packaging of the granules. These results gave an indication to the scrubber&#8217;s capacity to absorb CO2. CO2 absorption can be further inferred by placing thermocouples at various places within the canister and using relationship between the reaction and temperature to give an indication of absorption within the scrubber. As the chemical reaction occurs, the temperature rises and water vapour is produced. Through measuring both temperature and humidity, it was found that temperature gave the most consistent indication of CO2&gt; absorption rather than humidity as the higher the humidity levels, the more erratic the humidity results became. The result of the experimental testing is a body of data benchmarked off current literature for validation which is used to compare with a transient CFD model to further the knowledge of CO2 absorption. The development of a CFD model for the CCR scrubber allows the simulation to assist in future designs of CCR system. It allows the simulation of alternative scrubber geometries which may be subjected to external parameters to assess their performance. The advantage to implementing a design through CFD allows the user to simulate alternative CCR scrubber designs before incorporating a manufacturing cost to assess the performance of a given design. This reduces cost, time and can assist the decision of manufacturing a given CCR scrubber. The results demonstrate that the CFD simulation using the mixture model theory is sufficiently reliable to simulate the reaction between CO and soda lime in CCR scrubbers."</description>

                Global climate change caused by carbon dioxide emissions has become a hot topic globally. It is of great significance to study how low-carbon landscapes can reduce carbon emissions and improve the ecological environment. In this study, CiteSpace software was used to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the research field. The analysis data were based on 2910 studies published in the research field from 2002 to 2023. By analyzing the number of publications in the research field, cooperation networks, keywords, etc., the research status, processes, and hotspots of low-carbon landscapes were systematically reviewed. The results show the following: (1) Between 2002 and 2023, low-carbon landscape research developed rapidly, gradually becoming a multidisciplinary field. A large number of studies were conducted by relevant institutions and scholars from 106 countries. (2) The research focuses on carbon emission reduction, renewable energy, life cycle assessment, etc. The research mainly goes through the following stages: theoretical research on low-carbon technology, the application of low-carbon technology, and the development of the low-carbon economy. (3) Research frontiers focus on low-carbon landscape emission-reduction technologies, low-carbon landscape research methods, and the development and application of low-carbon materials. This study deeply analyzes the research process of low-carbon landscapes and puts forward a research direction for low-carbon landscapes in future urban development, such as economic benefit assessments, ecosystem restoration and protection, social participation, and policy support, in order to provide a reference for low-carbon landscape research.</description>

      <title>Carbon dioxide emission equivalent calculation and inter-sectoral transfer pattern of different water use terminals in China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.143561</link>
      <description>Yun-Jeong Ji, Qiting Zuo, Zhizhuo Zhang, Qingsong Wu, Journal of Cleaner Production. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402200396

                In the context of global climate change, all industries have put forward the requirements for carbon emission reduction. The effective use of water resources is the key to achieving carbon emission reduction, so it is particularly important to review the carbon dioxide emission equivalents of water resource utilization behaviors (CEE-WRUBs) of water users. However, existing research on CEE-WRUBs across various water sectors remains inadequate. Therefore, this study integrates the enhanced CEEA method, LMDI decomposition model, and IOA method to analyze CEE-WRUBs across diverse water use terminals. Then seeks their main driving factors and their transfer pattern among different industries, which are crucial to the realization of the global carbon neutrality objective. The results showed that: (1) China's CEE-WRUBs show a significant downward trend. Industrial water use emerges as the primary source of CEE, but the CEE-WRUBs of most industrial water terminals show a fluctuating downward trend. Grains' water use behavior (WRUBs) absorbed the largest CEE, reaching 14,698 Mt in 2020. (2) the water efficiency effect emerges as the predominant driver behind the increase in CEE-WRUBs most of the time, and holding a prominent position. The carbon emission intensity effect primarily steers the reduction of CEE-WRUBs. (3) the largest net outflow sector of WRUBs embodied carbon in 2007-2020 was transformed from basic material heavy industry (-153.54 Mt in 2007) to agriculture (-128.26 Mt in 2020). Most of the WRUBs embodied carbon of agriculture flows into light industry, while most of the WRUBs embodied carbon of basic material heavy industry flows into finishing heavy industry and construction. The methods and results of this study provide a potential reference for investigating the regional water-carbon relationship and advancing the global carbon neutrality objective.</description>

      <title>Should electric vehicle purchase subsidies be linked with scrappage requirements?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/pam.22639</link>
      <description>Kevin Ankney, Benjamin Leard, Journal of Policy Analysis and Management. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402239004

                Abstract We build a vehicle purchase and disposal model to analyze a policy that links a new electric vehicle (EV) purchase subsidy with a used gasoline vehicle scrappage requirement. We evaluate the policy based on changes in sales, scrappage, subsidy dollars spent, and emissions reductions. We find that linking a purchase subsidy with a scrappage requirement is expected to result in fewer new EV sales and carbon dioxide emissions reductions relative to a policy without linking. Our modeling reveals that these effects are due to trade&#8208;in vehicle eligibility requirements and opportunity costs lowering additional participation in the linked policy. However, the linked policy significantly increases used vehicle scrappage and is more progressive than the unlinked policy. We find that emissions reductions due to additional scrappage are sensitive to how remaining miles of scrapped vehicles are replaced.</description>

The reduction of carbon dioxide with molecular hydrogen in the presence of Fe,Cr-containing catalysts supported on Sibunit carbon material at 400C and pressures of 0,1 and 8,5 MPa was studied. Selective formation of carbon monoxide is possible over the catalysts with the ratio Fe: Cr = 1-5. C-C hydrocarbons with a predominance of methane are formed along with CO at decreasing chromium content in the catalyst (5Fe-0,25Cr/C sample). It was shown by transmission electron microscopy that the main phase in 5Fe-5Cr/C catalyst is iron chromite FeCrO (spinel structural type), which prevents the reduction of iron and the formation of its carbides, which, in turn, provide the formation of hydrocarbons upon the interaction of CO and H.</description>

      <title>Clostridium autoethanogenum alters cofactor synthesis, redox metabolism, and lysine-acetylation in response to elevated H2:CO feedstock ratios for enhancing carbon capture efficiency</title>

Brown, Robert L. Hettich, Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts. 17(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402179496

                Abstract Background Clostridium autoethanogenum is an acetogenic bacterium that autotrophically converts carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) gases into bioproducts and fuels via the Wood&#8211;Ljungdahl pathway (WLP). To facilitate overall carbon capture efficiency, the reaction stoichiometry requires supplementation of hydrogen at an increased ratio of H 2 :CO to maximize CO 2 utilization; however, the molecular details and thus the ability to understand the mechanism of this supplementation are largely unknown. Results In order to elucidate the microbial physiology and fermentation where at least 75% of the carbon in ethanol comes from CO 2 , we established controlled chemostats that facilitated a novel and high (11:1) H 2 :CO uptake ratio. We compared and contrasted proteomic and metabolomics profiles to replicate continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) at the same growth rate from a lower (5:1) H 2 :CO condition where ~ 50% of the carbon in ethanol is derived from CO 2 . Our hypothesis was that major changes would be observed in the hydrogenases and/or redox-related proteins and the WLP to compensate for the elevated hydrogen feed gas. Our analyses did reveal protein abundance differences between the two conditions largely related to reduction&#8211;oxidation (redox) pathways and cofactor biosynthesis, but the changes were more minor than we would have expected. While the Wood&#8211;Ljungdahl pathway proteins remained consistent across the conditions, other post-translational regulatory processes, such as lysine-acetylation, were observed and appeared to be more important for fine-tuning this carbon metabolism pathway. Metabolomic analyses showed that the increase in H 2 :CO ratio drives the organism to higher carbon dioxide utilization resulting in lower carbon storages and accumulated fatty acid metabolite levels. Conclusions This research delves into the intricate dynamics of carbon fixation in C. autoethanogenum , examining the influence of highly elevated H 2 :CO ratios on metabolic processes and product outcomes. The study underscores the significance of optimizing gas feed composition for enhanced industrial efficiency, shedding light on potential mechanisms, such as post-translational modifications (PTMs), to fine-tune enzymatic activities and improve desired product yields.</description>

      <title>Building energy consumption analysis and measures: a case study from an administration building in Chengdu, China</title>

                Abstract With the peak of carbon dioxide emissions and carbon neutrality, China is placing greater emphasis on energy expenditure. Office buildings occupy a prominent position in building energy consumption, which is one of the main energy consumption areas. Taking an administration building in Chengdu as an example, this article simulates the building energy consumption based on Design Builder software, examines the variables influencing energy consumption, and suggests energy-saving strategies combined with fresh ideas for sustainable architectural design. The results showed that the modeling building was a high-energy-consuming building, with an energy consumption of 724,857.59 kWh, and a unit area energy consumption of 288.17 kWh/m 2 in Chengdu. For energy conservation and emission reduction, this article proposes the following three energy-saving measures. The first is to apply heat recovery technology for air conditioning systems. The second is photovoltaic glass, which provides partial electricity demand for buildings and reduces dependence on traditional energy sources. The third is roof greening, which utilizes the plants to purify the air and beautify the environment. The results showed that the heat recovery technology in air conditioning systems reduced the total energy consumption of buildings from 642144.04 kWh/m 2 to 502937.83 kWh/m 2 , photovoltaic glass reduced 552243.87 kWh/m 2 , and roof greening reduced to 635947.35 kWh/m 2 . All of these have good energy-saving and emission reduction effects. The above three strategies not only help reduce building energy consumption, but also provide substantial support for China to achieve carbon neutrality.</description>

                Industrialization and urbanization are amongst the major sources of air pollution. Though high-performance nanomaterials offer compelling advances for air filtration and purification. In this work, several nanomaterials were tested for their ability to remove particulates (PM2.5 and PM10) and VOCs, while evaluating the wear and tear of each material. Pressure had no effect on PM2.5 capture efficiency which was 80% using activated carbon, while carbon nanotubes were more efficient in PM10 capture despite greater pressure drop. Graphene oxide was very effective in the abatement of volatile organic compounds, which was not the case for titanium dioxide which performed as good as activated carbon in the capture of PM2.5 particles but with a pressure drop of the same magnitude. Silver nanoparticles were the most effective in a percent capture of PM10 particles at low pressure drop. Yeoman&#8217;s zinc was effective in re-absorbing volatile organic compounds from the dust. The PEI-coated and electro spun nanofibers are capable of capturing PM2.5 and PM10 particles respectively, and at relatively low-pressure reductions. Results from durability studies demonstrated that TiO2 and silver nanoparticles exhibited superior efficiency retention throughout numerous cycles, but PEI-coated nanofibers saw substantial efficiency degradation</description>

      <title>Adsorption of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on Transition Metal-Doped Cu Clusters: A DFT Study</title>

                Activation of CO2 is the first step towards its reduction to more useful chemicals. Electrochemical CO2 reduction reactions can lead to high value-added chemical and materials production while helping decrease anthropogenic CO2 emissions. In studies, it was found that copper metal clusters can reduce CO2 to more than thirty different hydrocarbons and oxygenates, yet they lack the required selectivity. Density functional theory (DFT)-based studies are carried out on copper clusters, doped clusters, nano-structures and Cu-based alloy catalysts to assess the activity and selectivity of CO2 reduction to generate carbon monoxide (CO), formic acid (HCOOH), formaldehyde (H2C=O), methanol (CH3OH) and methane (CH4 ). In this chapter, we will discuss the effect of the adsorption of CO2 on (Sc, Ti, V) metaldoped clusters. DFT studies carried out for these clusters showed a high CO2 adsorption energy, a low activation barrier for its dissociation, and a facile regeneration of the clusters. The reaction energies (dopant-dependent), the mechanisms for reaction, dissociation barriers for CO2, and less desorption energies (dopant dependent) for carbon monoxide (CO) during the activation of CO2 with Cu3X clusters (X= first row transition metals) are discussed in the chapter. C6Li6 is not capable of capturing CO2 molecules but is effective in their storage. The interaction of CO2with superalkalis such as FLi2 , OLi3 , and NLi4 and non-metallic superalkalis such as F2H3 , O2H5, and N2H7 is also included due to its applications.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Synergistic Drivers of CO2 and NOX Emissions from Thermal Power Generating Units in Beijing&#8211;Tianjin&#8211;Hebei Region, 2010&#8211;2020</title>

                Synergistic control of the emissions of air pollutants and CO2 is critical to the dual challenges of air quality improvement and climate change in China. Based on the emission inventories of thermal power units in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, this study analyzes the CO2 and NOX emission characteristics of these units, and identifies and quantifies the synergistic drivers affecting these emission trends. The inventory data show that, between 2010 and 2020, NOX emissions were reduced by 86.1%, while CO2 emissions were reduced by only 29.8%. Although significant progress has been made in reducing NOX emissions through measures such as end-of-pipe treatment, controlling CO2 emissions remains a difficult task. The index decomposition analysis reveals that economic growth is the main driver of CO2 and NOX emission growth, energy intensity reduction is the main driver of CO2 emission reduction, and end-of-pipe treatment is the main driver of NOX emission reduction. Currently, coal occupies about 87% of the energy consumption of thermal power units in the Beijing&#8211;Tianjin&#8211;Hebei region, and remains the main type of energy for synergistic emissions, and the potential for emission reduction in the energy structure remains huge. For NOX emissions, it is expected that 90% of the reduction potential can be achieved through energy restructuring and end-of-pipe treatment. In conclusion, this high-precision unit-by-unit emission study confirms the effectiveness of the control policy for thermal power units in the region and provides some scientific reference for future policy formulation.</description>

Metal - hyper-cross-linked polystyrene (HCP) composites active in the hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons were obtained by impregnation of HCP with palladium and rhodium compounds in supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO) followed by their reduction to the metallic state with molecular hydrogen. The influence of the conditions for the preparation of composites on their activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of diphenylacetylene (DFA) was evaluated. The adsorption of palladium hexafluoroacetylacetonate on HCP from the SC-CO medium was studied for the first time using supercritical fluid chromatography; it is shown that the adsorption equilibrium is described by the Langmuir equation.</description>

      <title>Time-Resolved Infrared Spectroscopic Evidence for Interfacial pH-Dependent Kinetics of Formate Evolution on Cu Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c03521</link>

                By deployment of rapid-scan (second time scale) electrochemical FT-IR reflection&#8211;absorption spectroscopy, we studied the reduction of CO2 in 0.1 M Na2SO4 in deuterated water at a pD of 3.7. We report on the impact of dynamic changes in the bicarbonate equilibrium concentration in the vicinity of a polycrystalline Cu electrode, induced by step changes in applied electrode potential. We correlate these changes in interfacial composition and concentrations of dissolved species to the formation rate of formate, and provide evidence for the following conclusions: (i) the kinetics for the conversion of dissolved CO2 to formate (formic acid) are fast, (ii) bicarbonate is also converted to formate, but with less favorable kinetics, and (iii) carbonate does not yield any formate. These results reveal that formate formation requires (mildly) acidic conditions at the interface for CO2 to undergo a proton-coupled conversion step, and we postulate that bicarbonate reduction to formate is driven by catalytic hydrogenation via in situ formed H2. Interestingly CO was not observed, suggesting that the kinetics of the CO2 to CO reaction are significantly less favorable than formate formation under the experimental conditions (pH and applied potential). We also analyzed the feasibility of pulsed electrolysis to enhance the (average) rate of formation of formate. While a short positive potential pulse enhances the CO2 concentration, this also leads to the formation of basic copper carbonates, resulting in electrode deactivation. These observations demonstrate the potential of rapid-scan EC-IRRAS to elucidate the mechanisms and kinetics of electrochemical reactions, offering valuable insights for optimizing catalyst and electrolyte performance and advancing CO2 reduction technologies.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Primary and Secondary Emission Mitigation Measures for Small-Scale Wood Chip Combustion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17174403</link>

                The objective of this study is to systematically investigate not only the influence of different additive types&#8212;beyond the much-considered case of aluminum-silicate-based additives&#8212;but also to carry out an additional comparison between primary and secondary emission mitigation measures during small-scale wood-chip combustion. Hence, combustion trials are realized within a 33-kW combustion plant. Pine wood chips additivated with 1.0 wt%a.r. of four additives have shown promising emission reduction effects in the past; namely kaolin (i.e., aluminum-silicate-based), anorthite (i.e., aluminum-silicate- and calcium-based), aluminum hydroxide (i.e., aluminum-based), and titanium dioxide (i.e., titanium-based). In addition to the primary mitigation measure (i.e., (fuel) additivation), an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) as a common secondary mitigation measure for total particulate matter (TPM) reduction is used for comparison. In addition to standard analyses (e.g., gravimetric determination of TPM emissions), an extended methodology (e.g., characterization of the elemental composition and ultrafine particle fraction of TPM emissions) is applied. The results show that the additivation of wood chips with kaolin and anorthite can lead to an operation of the combustion plant in compliance with the German legal TPM limit values by undercutting the absolute emission level achievable by the ESP. Additionally, kaolin and anorthite achieve significant reductions in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, while kaolin simultaneously, and similarly to ESP, also leads to a shift in the particle size number distribution of PM emissions towards coarser particles. All additives show a significant reduction of potassium (K) emissions by the formation of high-temperature stable K compounds in the resulting ashes.</description>

                The implementation of energy-saving measures has a substantial and beneficial impact on the preservation of energy resources as well as the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. This study focuses on the design and experimental analysis of a water-to-air heat recovery system aimed at capturing waste heat from wastewater and transferring it to a fresh cold air stream using heat pipe technology. The research problem addressed in this study is the efficient recovery of low-grade thermal energy from wastewater, which is often underutilized. The prototype heat recovery unit was designed, manufactured, and tested in the laboratory to assess its performance across various operating conditions. The experimental setup included a system where the primary agent, hot water, was heated to 60 &#176;C and circulated through the evaporator section of the heat recovery unit, while the secondary agent, fresh air, was forced through the condenser section. The system&#8217;s performance was evaluated under different air velocities, ranging from 3.5 m/s to 4.5 m/s, corresponding to airflow rates of 207.1 m3/h and 268.6 m3/h, respectively. The study employed analytical methods alongside empirical testing to determine the effectiveness of the heat recovery system, with the global heat transfer coefficient calculated for different scenarios. The efficiency of the system varied between 25% and 51.6%, depending on the temperature and speed of the fresh air stream. The most significant temperature difference observed between the inflow and outflow of the fresh air stream was 16.8 &#176;C, resulting in a thermal output of 1553 W. Additionally, the average (mean) overall heat transfer coefficient of the unit was calculated to be 49 W/m2 K, which aligns with values reported in the literature for similar systems. The results demonstrate the potential of the designed system for practical applications in energy conservation and carbon emission reduction.</description>

      <title>Life Cycle Assessment of CO2-Based and Conventional Methanol Production Pathways in Thailand</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12091868</link>
      <description>Adeel Rafiq, Ahsan Farooq, Shabbir H. Gheewala, Processes. 12(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402130289

                Methanol production through carbon capture and utilization technologies offers promising alternatives to traditional natural-gas-based methods, potentially mitigating climate change impacts and improving resource efficiency. This study evaluates four methanol production pathways: CO2 hydrogenation, tri-reforming of methane, electrochemical CO2 reduction, and co-electrolysis of CO2 and water. The analysis covers 19 scenarios, combining three electricity mixes (100% Thai grid mix, 50% Thai grid mix and 50% renewable energy, and 100% renewable energy) with two hydrogen production technologies (alkaline water electrolysis and grey hydrogen). Environmental life cycle assessment results showed that most pathways perform well when using the 100% renewable energy with co-electrolysis (CE-100%) showing the most substantial reductions across all impact categories as compared conventional methanol production. Electrochemical reduction demonstrated the poorest environmental performance for all scenarios. In Thailand, implementing the CE-100% pathway could potentially yield 12.4 million tonnes of methanol annually from the cement industry&#8217;s CO2 emissions, with an estimated value of approximately USD 5.4 billion, while reducing emissions from the industrial processes and product use (IPPU) sector by 75%. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers, supporting Thailand&#8217;s transition towards sustainable methanol production and broader climate goals.</description>

      <description>Ji Yeon Hong, Ga Ram Ahn, Hyun Jung Kim, Joon Seok, Kui Young Park, Skin Research and Technology. 30(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402133220

                Abstract Background Acne vulgaris poses a significant dermatological challenge, necessitating alternative treatments due to limitations and side effects associated with current therapies. This pilot clinical trial investigated the feasibility and efficacy of precision cryotherapy for acne vulgaris. Methods A total of 20 volunteers underwent targeted precision cryotherapy using a carbon dioxide&#8208;based device. Treatment outcomes were assessed using various parameters, including Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score, acne lesion count, erythema index (EI), global evaluation score, and participant satisfaction. Safety monitoring included adverse event reporting and physical examination. Results Precision cryotherapy demonstrated a significant reduction (90.25%) in the acne lesion count by week 4, with clinical improvement indicated by IGA score reduction ( p &lt; 0.001). The EI showed notable improvements at weeks 1, 2, and 4. The global evaluation score demonstrated a 75%&#8211;100% clinical improvement at Visit 4. Participants reported high satisfaction (6.75 &#177; 0.79) with the procedure. No adverse event or discomfort was reported. Conclusion Precision cryotherapy effectively improved acne lesions, which was safe and satisfactory for participants. These findings suggest its potential as an alternative therapeutic modality, especially for populations with limited treatment options. Further research is needed to validate the results and explore underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Heat transport in SiCOH thin films: an experimental and molecular dynamics study</title>

                Abstract Carbon-doped silicon dioxide (SiCOH) film is currently regarded as one of the most promising low-k materials in the integrated circuits (ICs) industry for advanced technology nodes. However, there have been limited studies on the thermal properties of SiCOH compared to its electrical and mechanical properties. In this study, we investigate the thermal conductivity of SiCOH thin films through molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and experimental characterizations. Our findings indicate that the size effect on thermal conductivity at 300 K is negligible when the thickness of SiCOH film is less than 20 nm. Additionally, we observe a contrasting temperature dependence law for the thermal conductivity of SiCOH thin films compared to crystal SiO2 thin films. Furthermore, we demonstrate a significant decrease in thermal conductivity with increasing porosity in SiCOH films; specifically, an increase in porosity from 5.35% to 42.77% results in a 60% reduction in thermal conductivity. Moreover, we validate our simulation results by characterizing the thermal conductivity of SiCOH using 3&#969; method.&amp;#xD;</description>

                This paper presents projections on the reduction of CO2 emissions through the implementation of off-grid PV systems on 33 farms located in rural areas of the Departamento del Magdalena, where horticultural activities are performed by small local producers. To achieve this, the emission reduction was estimated for a period of 25 years using the installed PV peak power on each farm, data from the Global Solar Atlas, the emission factor in Colombia for electricity generation and information established in the harmonization project of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). In order to compare the estimations, temperature and solar irradiance data were obtained from 10 farms near the installations, located in 8 municipalities within the department. With these data and through mathematical modeling, the energy generated by each PV system and the projection of non-emitted CO2 emissions were calculated. The results obtained demonstrated that, in both cases, the projections for emission reduction are similar, highlighting that the municipalities of Ci&#233;naga and Sitio Nuevo contribute the highest amount of saved CO2 due to the projections of higher energy production in these locations.</description>

      <description>Zakaria Hamdi, W. C. Cheong, Mahmood Bataee, Behzad Partoon, No host. 208(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402144822

                Abstract The Hydrate-based CO2 Storage/Sequestration technique has the potential to contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 by enabling efficient and safe storage of CO2. This paper explores the potential of CO2 storage through gas hydrate formation in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, an innovative approach to mitigating climate change by reducing atmospheric CO2 levels. The current applications and potentials of gas hydrates are examined, highlighting their role in energy production, CO2 reduction via oceanic injection, energy storage, and other uses. Geological considerations are analyzed, emphasizing the self-sealing potential of CO2 hydrates, the mechanisms of CO2 sequestration through hydrate formation, and the impact of hydrate presence on reservoir permeability. Simulation studies provide insights into the feasibility and efficiency of this method. Various approaches for CO2 hydrate sequestration are discussed, outlining the practical steps and technological requirements involved. The environmental implications and potential challenges of CO2 hydrate sequestration are evaluated, considering the ecological impacts and long-term sustainability. This comprehensive review suggests that while CO2 storage through gas hydrate formation in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs holds significant promise, it necessitates further research and technological advancements to address the identified challenges and fully realize its potential as a viable climate mitigation strategy.</description>

      <title>Study of NO and CO Formation Pathways in Jet Flames with CH4/H2 Fuel Blends</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17174382</link>

                The existing natural gas transportation pipelines can withstand a hydrogen content of 0 to 50%, but further research is still needed on the pathways of NO and CO production under moderate or intense low oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion within this range of hydrogen blending. In this paper, we present a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of hydrogen-doped jet flame combustion in a jet in a hot coflow (JHC) burner. We conducted an in-depth study of the mechanisms by which NO and CO are produced at different locations within hydrogen-doped flames. Additionally, we established a chemical reaction network (CRN) model specifically for the JHC burner and calculated the detailed influence of hydrogen content on the mechanisms of NO and CO formation. The findings indicate that an increase in hydrogen content leads to an expansion of the main NO production region and a contraction of the main NO consumption region within the jet flame. This phenomenon is accompanied by a decline in the sub-reaction rates associated with both the prompt route and NO-reburning pathway via CHi=0&#8211;3 radicals, alongside an increase in N2O and thermal NO production rates. Consequently, this results in an overall enhancement of NO production and a reduction in NO consumption. In the context of MILD combustion, CO production primarily arises from the reduction of CO2 through the reaction CH2(S) + CO2 &#8660; CO + CH2O, the introduction of hydrogen into the system exerts an inhibitory effect on this reduction reaction while simultaneously enhancing the CO oxidation reaction, OH + CO &#8660; H + CO2, this dual influence ultimately results in a reduction of CO production.</description>

                Aim. To identify specific features of production and use of transportation biofuels in selected developing countries, as well as to assess the potential of bioethanol industry development in the Russian Federation (RF). Objectives . To generalize the experience of production and use of transport biofuels in Brazil, China and Indonesia; to determine the specifics of biofuel industry development in the mentioned developing countries. Methods. The methods of system analysis, comparative analysis, method of expert evaluations, mathematical, statistical methods were applied in the process of research. Results. The specificity of biofuel industry development in Brazil, China and Indonesia is shown. The production and use of transportation biofuels in these countries is carried out within the framework of a systemic state policy focused on diversification of energy consumption, promotion of renewable energy sources, reduction of pollutant emissions and stimulation of economic growth. Opportunities and risks for the development of production and use of transportation biofuels have been identified. The opportunities include, first of all, the formation of additional demand for agricultural products (including waste) and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from the transport sector. At the same time, the production of first-generation transportation biofuels can negatively affect food security, reorienting agricultural producers from the production of &#8220;food&#8221; to the production of &#8220;raw materials for the energy sector&#8221;, and natural ecosystems, contributing to the involvement of new land plots in agricultural turnover. Conclusions. System analysis of the accumulated experience of production and use of transport biofuels in Brazil, China and Indonesia indicates the promising development of bioethanol industry in Russia. At the same time, the realization of this direction should not contribute to the strengthening of anthropogenic impact on the environment and adversely affect the availability of food.</description>

      <title>Molecular Composition of Exogenous Dissolved Organic Matter Regulates Dissimilatory Iron Reduction and Carbon Emissions in Paddy Soil</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202409.0323.v1</link>
      <description>Li Wang, X. Liu, Yuchen Shu, Gang Li, Cen Sun, Davey L. Jones, Yong&#8208;Guan Zhu, Xianyong Lin, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402288064

                Soil carbon (C) cycling under anoxic conditions is mechanistically linked to dissimilatory iron (Fe) reduction, which could be regulated by exogenous dissolved organic matter (DOM). However, the impact of complex exogenous DOM on soil microbial activity and C-Fe coupling in paddy soils remains underexplored. With a 100-day microcosm experiment, we determined that the molecular composition of DOM derived from organic fertilizers and biochar on paddy soil affects soil microbial community, Fe reduction, and C emissions. Our results indicated that biochar-DOM significantly promoted Fe reduction and accelerated CH4 and CO2 emissions, and organic manure-DOM increased soil CO2 emissions, which was closely related to the molecular composition of exogenous DOM. DOM molecules with high aromaticity (AImod) and high DBE, including lignins-vascular plant-derived polyphenols, lignins-polycyclic aromatics (PA), and condensed aromatics-PA, promoted soil Fe reduction and CH4 emissions by enriching soil Fe-reducing bacteria (FeRB), reducing methanotrophs, and facilitating r-strategists at the early stage of incubation. Conversely, DOMs with low AImod, low DBE and high H/C, such as lignins-highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and proteins-aliphatic compounds, enhanced CO2 emissions by facilitating recalcitrant C degradation and CH4 oxidation at the late stage of incubation. In conclusion, our study highlights the importance of the molecular composition of DOMs derived from organic amendments in regulating soil Fe reduction and C emissions. The findings offer novel insights into the effective utilization of agricultural resources and the mitigation of soil C emissions.</description>

                The European decarbonization goals and requirement for energy independence are mostly relying on intermittent renewable energy sources for electrification. A numerical model was developed to simulate the operation of a steam generator, allowing a study of the potential impacts of retrofitting existing coal-fired power plants to operate with biomass or coal&#8211;biomass mixtures on combustion parameters and CO2 emissions. The results obtained using the operational parameters of the Sines power plant indicate that a mixture of 25% coal and 75% pine sawdust allow operation at &#955; = 1.8, demonstrating that a small amount of coal allows operation near the coal combustion parameters (&#955; = 1.9). These conditions have the drawback of a reduction of 8.7% in adiabatic flame temperature but a significant reduction of 57.5% in CO2 emissions, considering the biomass as carbon-neutral.</description>

                Currently most research is focused CO2 storage into methane hydrate reservoirs because economic incentives from procuring methane gas. The main objectives of CO2 injection into methane hydrate are the simultaneous CO2 storage and CH4 recovery. Despite its prospects, CO2&#8211;CH4 hydrate replacement is facing efficiency challenges, when mixed gas hydrate forms a mass barrier that inhibits further injection of CO2 gas or production of CH4 gas. Therefore, further research is encouraged to explore chemical and mechanical approaches to enhance the gas replacement process. Till date, only one CO2&#8211;CH4 hydrate replacement field-scale demonstration project has been carried out in I&#289;nik Sikumi gas hydrate field in Alaska North Slope, United States. The demonstration project concluded injecting mixed gas (N2 and CO2) has resulted in 70% N2 and 40% CO2 recovery, revealing the reservoir preferential CO2 retention. However, further large-scale demonstration projects are required to assess process efficiencies and economic viability. This chapter discusses conventional and hydrate-based CO2 storage pathways. Injecting CO2 in saline aquifers and hydrocarbon-bearing formation for enhance oil and gas recover are common practices for CO2 storage and utilization. Currently hydrate-based CO2 pathways are of great interest because their development and maturation would lead to significant increments in local and global CO2 sequestration capabilities in terms of increasing storage capacity available for meeting emission reduction goals for carbon neutral future. Hydrate-based CO2 storage methods involve injection of CO2 into permafrost environments, injection into deep ocean, injection beneath marine sediments, and lastly injection into methane hydrate-bearing sediment.</description>

      <title>Successful Story in Offshore EOR Full Field Development (Shengli - CB22F), Production Increase, Energy Savings!</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/220656-ms</link>
      <description>Dorian Rotier, Jianhua Gong, Li Bi, Li Chen, Guillaume Dupuis, Marine Cognet, M. Tizzotti, Chenghao Zhu, Flavien Gathier, Marie&#8208;Paule Lefranc, No host. 17(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402144821

                Abstract This paper presents the implementation of chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR) on the offshore platform CB22F, detailing its impact over three years and proposing improvements for future deployments. It discusses the project's effects, such as increased oil production, reduced water cut, and lowered CO2 emissions, while sharing insights for optimizing future CEOR designs on two newly sanctioned platforms. The CEOR strategy on CB22F has shown significant outcomes, demonstrated by an increase in oil production, a reduction in water cut, and a decrease in CO2 emissions. Oil production increased by 663 of barrels per day (b/d), the water cut decreased from 90% to 80.5%, reducing the volumes of water handled. This decrease in water cut lowered energy consumption for water pumping and chemical treatment costs for produced water, leading to a reduction in cost and CO2 emissions to produce one barrel of oil. The test area began showing positive effects by June 2021, with a significant decrease in water content in produced fluids in 2022 and a rapid increase in oil output. By the end of March 2024, the water cut stabilized around 80.5%, and the cumulative oil increase from the 44 effective production wells reached 3,800,000 barrels, corresponding to a 4.27% increase in oil recovery. This cumulative increase translates to 28.9 tons of oil per ton of polymer injected, indicating the project's economic viability. Building on the success of CB22F, CEOR will be implemented on two newly sanctioned platforms with designs incorporating improvements learned from CB22F's experience. Bulk polymer delivery via pneumatic transfer will mitigate hoisting risks, improve occupational health, increase offshore storage capacity, and reduce delivery rotations, thus decreasing CO2 emissions associated with logistic operations. An integrated injection system will involve a centralized polymer injection system on the main platform, facilitating efficient distribution to both main and satellite platforms. The introduction of new Conical Pressure Reducer (CPR) skids, equipped with low shear valves, will regulate injection pressure, and adapt the polymer concentration for individual wells, minimizing polymer degradation and footprint compared to conventional methods. To address higher polymer/surfactant concentrations in produced fluids, concerns regarding emulsification are being managed through the development of new, high-efficiency water clarifiers. These improvements, guided by CB22F's experience, are expected to further optimize CEOR performance and efficiency on future platforms. This paper provides insights for engineers by demonstrating a successful CEOR implementation with concrete results and data, sharing practical improvements for future CEOR designs on offshore platforms, addressing potential challenges, and proposing viable solutions. Additionally, it contributes to knowledge on CO2 reduction strategies in oil and gas production, highlighting the environmental benefits alongside the financial gains. The reduction in CO2 emissions per barrel of oil produced underscores the broader impact of the project beyond immediate financial gains, contributing to the long-term sustainability of oil production operations.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis and optimal allocation of virtual inertia from grid&#8208;forming and grid&#8208;following controlled ESSs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1049/rpg2.13085</link>
      <description>Naixuan Zhu, Pengfei Hu, Chongxi Jiang, Yanxue Yu, Daozhuo Jiang, IET Renewable Power Generation. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402138599

                Abstract A broad consensus of neutralizing the carbon dioxide emissions facilitates the transition to the renewable energy power system. Meanwhile, the concerns about the volatility of renewable energies are growing as the rotational inertia of power system becomes inadequate. To maintain the frequency stability of power system, some studies for configuring inertia energy storage systems (ESSs) are carried out, mainly focusing on the allocation of virtual inertia from grid&#8208;forming ESS. In contrast, the allocation of virtual inertia from grid&#8208;following ESS has not been well elaborated and the differences in virtual inertia provided by these two modes are yet to be revealed. Based on &#8208;norm and Kron reduction, firstly, the state&#8208;space model of post&#8208;disturbance system is established, together with the transient performance evaluation. Then the inertia characteristics of both grid&#8208;forming and grid&#8208;following devices are formulated, followed by the unified gradient descent optimization method for allocating virtual inertia. A modified IEEE 39&#8208;bus system and its time&#8208;domain simulations help in the verification of the contribution of this paper. Through the comparative analysis of corresponding optimal results, the conclusions from two aspects are drawn: in terms of transient frequency support, the grid&#8208;forming devices can provide no less than better inertia support; with the higher power capacity and similar energy capacity, the grid&#8208;forming devices can relieve the response pressure of other generators by approximately .</description>

                The reaction of aluminum bis-formate acenaphthene-1,2-diimine complex [(ArBIG-bian)Al(&#956;-OC(H)O)2Li(Thf)2] (I) (ArBIG-bian = 1,2-bis[(2,6-dibenzhydryl-4-methylphenyl)imino]acenaphthene), prepared by binding carbon dioxide by aluminum diimine hydride [(ArBIG-bian)Al(H)2]&#8211;[Li(Thf)4]+, with borane dimethyl sulfide and ammonia was studied. The reaction of I with BH3&#8729;SMe2 (1 : 1) in toluene affords the product of hydroboration of one formate group [(ArBIG-bian)Al(&#956;-OC(H)O)(OB(H)OCH3)Li(Thf)]2 (II), while the reaction of I with BH3&#8729;SMe2 (1 : 2) is accompanied by reduction of both formate groups and gives complex [(ArBIG-bian)Al(OBOCH3)2OLi2(Thf)2BH4]2 (III), methoxyboroxine (CH3OBO)3 and, presumably, compound [(ArBIG-bian)AlOCH3]. The reaction of I with one equivalent of ammonia in THF gives adduct [(ArBIG-bian)Al(NH3)(&#956;-OC(H)O)2Li(Thf)2] (IV), in which ammonia is coordinated to the aluminum atom, while the key bonds in I have not undergone ammonolysis. Compounds II&#8211;IV were characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and X-ray diffraction (CCDC no. 2255017 (II), 2255018 (III), 2255019 (IV)).</description>

      <title>Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction in Deep Eutectic Solvent: Effect of Water and Organic Diluents</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c04707</link>
      <description>Jianhua Tong, Miao Wang, Xiangdong Qiu, Shizhen Li, Hangqi Yang, Chuang Peng, ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp; Engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402146476

                Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are promising media for CO2 electroreduction because of their high CO2 solubility, low cost, and eco-friendliness. However, the high viscosity and poor ionic conductivity severely limit their applications. In this study, low-viscosity polar aprotic solvents, propylene carbonate (PC) and sulfolane (SL), were used as diluents in Ethaline (ChCl:2EG) to prepare mixed electrolytes for electrochemical CO2 reduction. Raman and infrared spectra indicate that PC and SL can participate in the eutectic network of Ethaline through intermolecular hydrogen bonding, thereby decreasing the viscosity. The current density of the Ag cathode increases from 1.7 to 8.0 and 5.3 mA/cm2 with the addition of PC and SL, respectively. The two diluents also result in improved CO faradaic efficiency (FECO) and suppressed HER because the C&#9552;O and S&#9552;O bonds in the molecular frameworks of PC and SL can disrupt the hydrogen bonds of accumulated water molecules during electrolysis. At &#8722;2.0 V, FECO increases from 63% to over 90% upon the addition of PC and SL. This study provides new insights into the design of high-performance DES electrolytes for CO2 electroreduction.</description>

      <title>The Synergistic Effect of CeO2 and Micron-Cu Enhances the Hydrogenation of CO2 to CO</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12091912</link>

                The catalytic applications of micron Cu powder are limited due to its large particle size and small specific surface area. Modifying micro-Cu powder to achieve a high catalytic performance is a challenge in the application of micron copper. In this work, micro-Cu was used to synthesize a CeO2&#8211;Cu catalyst, and the phase composition and surface pore structure were analyzed using XRD, BET, etc. The CO2 hydrogenation performance of the CeO2&#8211;Cu catalyst was analyzed in comparison with CeO2 and Cu, and we found that the CeO2&#8211;Cu catalyst exhibited a synergistic effect between Cu and cerium, resulting in a much higher hydrogenation performance at 500 &#176;C than CeO2 or Cu alone. H2-TPR and TEM characterization revealed that the CeO2&#8211;Cu catalyst formed interfacial interactions with a relatively large Ce&#8211;Cu interface, where cerium oxide could promote the reduction of CuO and lower the reduction temperature. Additionally, cerium oxide formed a confinement structure for Cu, and the CeO2&#8211;Cu catalyst exhibited a higher oxygen vacancy concentration, thereby promoting the CO2 hydrogenation performance. Cu&#8211;CeO2 interaction provides valuable insights into the catalytic application of micron Cu powder.</description>

                Direct Air Capture (DAC) is a rapidly evolving technology that extracts CO2 directly from ambient air. This study presents a comprehensive performance evaluation of integrating DAC in HVAC systems, which can reduce indoor CO2 concentration and improve energy efficiency of HVAC systems. The DAC equipment is modeled in Modelica based on isotherm and thermodynamic equations, and pressure drop curves of the CO2 sorbent described in literature. The model is validated with data from the literature, and then integrated into a typical HVAC system available in Modelica Buildings library. The HVAC system is a Variable Air Volume (VAV) with reheater system for a one-floor office building with standard ASHRAE 2006 control sequences. Demand control ventilation strategies are designed to reduce the outdoor air flowrates when indoor CO2 concentrations are lower than the threshold, which is to maximize the benefits of integrating DAC. Four cases are proposed to assess the impacts of integrating DAC and DCV in HVAC systems in 8 different ASHRAE climate zones in the USA. The results show that by integrating DAC unit into the HVAC system, the average indoor CO2 concentration can be significantly reduced by over 45% against the baseline without a DAC unit. By integrating DCV, 0.39-21.66% of annual energy savings and 226-9539 kg carbon emissions reduction are observed across different climate zones. The highest energy savings are found to be achieved with cold climatic conditions while the lowest energy savings occur with favorable weather.</description>

                ConspectusCarbon dioxide (CO2) is recognized as a greenhouse gas and a common waste product. Simultaneously, it serves as an advantageous and commercially available C1 building block to generate valuable chemicals. Particularly, carboxylation with CO2 is considered a significant method for the direct and sustainable production of important carboxylic acids. However, the utilization of CO2 is challenging owing to its thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness. Recently, organic electrosynthesis has emerged as a promising approach that utilizes electrons or holes as environmentally friendly redox reagents to produce reactive intermediates in a controlled and selective manner. This technique holds great potential for the CO2 utilization.Since 2015, our group has been dedicated to exploring the utilization of CO2 in organic synthesis with a particular focus on electrochemical carboxylation. Despite the significant advancements made in this area, there are still many challenges, including the activation of inert substrates, regulation of selectivity, diversity in electrolysis modes, and activation strategies. Over the past 7 years, our team, with many great experts, has presented findings on electrochemical carboxylation with CO2 under mild conditions. In this context, we primarily highlight our contributions to selective electrocarboxylations, encompassing new reaction systems, selectivity control methods, and activation approaches.We commenced our research by establishing a Ni-catalyzed electrochemical carboxylation of unactivated aryl halides and alkyl bromides in conjunction with a useful paired anodic reaction. This approach eliminates the need for sacrificial anodes, rendering the carboxylation process sustainable. To further utilize the widely existing yet cost-effective alkyl chlorides, we have developed a deep electroreductive system to achieve carboxylation of unactivated alkyl chlorides and poly(vinyl chloride), allowing the direct modification and upgrading of waste polymers.Through precise adjustment of the electroreductive conditions, we successfully demonstrated the dicarboxylation of both strained carbocycles and acyclic polyarylethanes with CO2 via C&#8211;C bond cleavage. Furthermore, we have realized the dicarboxylative cyclization of unactivated skipped dienes to produce the valuable ring-tethered adipic acids through single-electron reduction of CO2 to the CO2 radical anion (CO2&#8226;&#8211;). In terms of the asymmetric carboxylation, Guo's and our groups have recently achieved the nickel-catalyzed enantioselective electroreductive carboxylation reaction using racemic propargylic carbonates and CO2, paving the way for the synthesis of enantioenriched propargylic carboxylic acids.In addition to the aforementioned advancements, Lin's and our groups have also developed new electrolysis modes to achieve regiodivergent C&#8211;H carboxylation of N-heteroarenes dictated by electrochemical reactors. The choice of reactors plays a crucial role in determining whether the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reagents are formed anodically, consequently influencing the carboxylation pathways of N-heteroarene radical anions in the distinct electrolyzed environments.</description>

      <title>Cu promoted Ni-Ca dual functional materials for integrated CO2 capture and utilization in O2-containing flue gas: Eliminating the delay in the utilization stage</title>

                Integrating CO2 capture and utilization by dry reforming methane (ICCU-DRM) technology is promising in concentrating and utilizing diluted CO2 from flue gas, which depends on developing Dual Functional Materials (DFMs) with adsorption and catalytic sites. Ni-Ca materials are widely applied in ICCU-DRM due to their excellent catalytic and CO2 adsorption properties. Nevertheless, the challenge remains that oxygen in the actual flue gas would oxidize the active Ni, leading to a delay in the DRM stage. In this work, Cu-promoted, ZrO2-stabilized Ni-Ca based DFMs were developed, which suppressed the delay and enhanced the performance of the DRM reaction. Attribute to the excellent reducing properties, Cu could be rapidly reduced in the CH4 atmosphere and further promote the reduction of NiO to the catalytically active Ni monomers by activating methane to generate reactive hydrogen (H*). What's more, attributed to the disappearance of delay times, it is accompanied by a satisfying yield distribution with a 0.11 decrease in H2/CO ratio and an improvement in conversion, especially CH4 conversion with an increase of more than 10%. In addition, the bifunctional material also exhibits favorable cycling stability due to the stabilizers.</description>

                Acidic CO2 electrolysis offers a promising strategy to achieve high carbon utilization and high energy efficiency. However, challenges remain in suppressing the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and improving product selectivity. High concentrations of potassium ions (K+) can suppress HER and accelerate CO2 reduction, but they still inevitably suffer from salt precipitation problems. In this study, we demonstrate that the sulfonate&#8208;based polyelectrolyte, polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), enables to reconstruct the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface to significantly enhance the acidic CO2 electrolysis. Mechanistic studies reveal that PSS induces high local K+ concentrations through electrostatic interaction between PSS anions and K+. In situ spectroscopy reveals that PSS reshapes the interfacial hydrogen&#8211;bond (H&#8211;bond) network, which is attributed to the H&#8211;bonds between PSS anions and hydrated proton as well as the steric hindrance of the additive molecules. This greatly weakens proton transfer kinetics and leads to the suppression of undesirable HER. As a result, a Faradaic efficiency of 93.9% for CO can be achieved at 250 mA cm&#8211;2, simultaneous with a high single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency of 72.2% on commercial Ag catalysts in acid. This study highlights the important role of the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface induced by polyelectrolyte additives in promoting electrocatalytic reactions.</description>

      <title>Cu single-atom electrocatalyst on nitrogen-containing graphdiyne for CO2 electroreduction to CH4</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/s1872-2067(24)60106-3</link>
      <description>Hao Dai, Tao Song, Xian Yue, Shuting Wei, Fuzhi Li, Yanchao Xu, Sai Shu, Zhen Cui, Li Wang, Jun Gu, Lele Duan, CHINESE JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS (CHINESE VERSION). 64(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402122113

                Developing Cu single-atom catalysts (SACs) with well-defined active sites is highly desirable for producing CH4 in the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction and understanding the structure-property relationship. Herein, a new graphdiyne analogue with uniformly distributed N2-bidentate (note that N2-bidentate site = N^N-bidentate site; N2 &#8800; dinitrogen gas in this work) sites are synthesized. Due to the strong interaction between Cu and the N2-bidentate site, a Cu SAC with isolated undercoordinated Cu-N2 sites (Cu1.0/N2-GDY) is obtained, with the Cu loading of 1.0 wt%. Cu1.0/N2-GDY exhibits the highest Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 80.6% for CH4 in electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 at &#8722;0.96 V vs. RHE, and the partial current density of CH4 is 160 mA cm&#8722;2. The selectivity for CH4 is maintained above 70% when the total current density is 100 to 300 mA cm&#8722;2. More remarkably, the Cu1.0/N2-GDY achieves a mass activity of 53.2 A/mgCu toward CH4 under &#8722;1.18 V vs. RHE. In situ electrochemical spectroscopic studies reveal that undercoordinated Cu-N2 sites are more favorable in generating key *COOH and *CHO intermediate than Cu nanoparticle counterparts. This work provides an effective pathway to produce SACs with undercoordinated Metal-N2 sites toward efficient electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Elevated CO2 and a Nitrogen Supply on the Growth of Faba Beans (Vicia faba L.) and the Nitrogen-Related Soil Bacterial Community</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/plants13172483</link>
      <description>Xingshui Dong, Hui Lin, Li Wang, Songmei Shi, Zhihui Wang, Sharifullah Sharifi, Junwei Ma, Xinhua He, Plants. 13(17)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402278435

                Ecosystems that experience elevated CO2 (eCO2) are crucial interfaces where intricate interactions between plants and microbes occur. This study addressed the impact of eCO2 and a N supply on faba bean (Vicia faba L.) growth and the soil microbial community in auto-controlled growth chambers. In doing so, two ambient CO2 concentrations (aCO2, daytime/nighttime = 410/460 ppm; eCO2, 550/610 ppm) and two N supplement levels (without a N supply&#8212;N0&#8212;and 100 mg N as urea per kg of soil&#8212;N100) were applied. The results indicated that eCO2 mitigated the inhibitory effects of a N deficiency on legume photosynthesis and affected the CO2 assimilation efficiency, in addition to causing reduced nodulation. While the N addition counteracted the reductions in the N concentrations across the faba beans&#8217; aboveground and belowground plant tissues under eCO2, the CO2 concentrations did not significantly alter the soil NH4+-N or NO3&#8722;-N responses to a N supply. Notably, under both aCO2 and eCO2, a N supply significantly increased the relative abundance of Nitrososphaeraceae and Nitrosomonadaceae, while eCO2 specifically reduced the Rhizobiaceae abundance with no significant changes under aCO2. A redundancy analysis (RDA) highlighted that the soil pH (p &lt; 0.01) had the most important influence on the soil microbial community. Co-occurrence networks indicated that the eCO2 conditions mitigated the impact of a N supply on the reduced structural complexity of the soil microbial communities. These findings suggest that a combination of eCO2 and a N supply to crops can provide potential benefits for managing future climate change impacts on crop production.</description>

      <title>Thunderstorm&#8208;related respiratory symptoms: An old story with a new ending?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/all.16308</link>
      <description>Francis Thien, Isabella Annesi&#8208;Maesano, Gennaro D&#8217;Amato, Allergy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402136228

                On November 21, 2016, the world was shaken by a catastrophic epidemic thunderstorm asthma event which overtook the Melbourne, a city of over 5 million people in south-eastern Australia. Following heavy early seasonal spring rains which allowed a lush growth of vegetation, a 10 day long hot dry spell in late spring was broken by a cool change and thunderstorms crossing over the city at 6 pm. A large proportion of the unsuspecting population was mainly outdoors, enjoying the beaches to cool off, or commuting on the way home from work. Within hours, hospital emergency departments were inundated as thousands of people presented with symptoms of respiratory distress and ambulances were overwhelmed with distress calls for help. The official figures of 3365 excess public hospital emergency department presentations with respiratory-related cases and 476 excess asthma-related hospital admissions (a 7-fold and 10-fold increase above average respectively) underestimate the thousands of others who presented to general practitioners and community pharmacies seeking relief.1 This dramatic event brought into sharp relief the story of thunderstorm-related respiratory symptoms which have been described globally now for over 40 years. Initially reported in the United Kingdom in 1983, dozens of events have been reported in diverse geographical regions including Canada, USA, Italy, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, Northern China, Australia and New Zealand.2 The Melbourne 2016 event was the deadliest by far with 10 fatalities, with 5 fatalities reported subsequently in Kuwait in 2016, and previously reported events (in UK and Australia) with single fatalities (Table 1). What have we learnt and how can we be better prepared to prevent or mitigate the risk of future events? These thunderstorm respiratory events arise from a common complex interaction of environmental and individual susceptibility factors. Main environmental factors include high concentrations of an aeroallergen and the presence of thunderstorms. Allergens which have been described include various mould species (Didymella exitalis, Myxomycetes and Alternaria sp.), weed (Parietaria/Urticaceae sp. and Amaranthaceae sp.), mugwort (Artemisia sp.), olive tree (Olea europaea) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne) pollens.3 Thunderstorm characteristics include outflows with colder air associated with the down draft from the thunderstorm, sweeping up pollen grains and particles and then concentrating them in a shallow band of air bringing atmospheric aeroallergens to ground level. For ryegrass pollen triggered events, evidence suggests thunderstorm moisture and rainwater ruptures ryegrass pollen grains by osmotic shock, releasing fine (&lt;2.5 &#956;m) allergen-bearing starch-granules respirable to the lower airways. This allows bypass of the usual upper airway filter and trigger acute bronchospasm via a putative direct lower airway allergen challenge, even in those not previously known to be asthmatic. Individual risk factors include prior allergen sensitization and exposure, with the presence of rhinitis being both a marker of allergic sensitization as well as a risk factor for latent and undiagnosed asthma. In those with diagnosed current asthma, low adherence to preventive inhaled steroids increases thunderstorm asthma risk. Other factors more recently identified include Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score &gt;1.5, ryegrass pollen specific IgE &gt; 10.1 kU/L, raised eosinophil counts, and raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level.4 The effect of climate change on allergenic pollen and weather patterns and their impact on health and healthcare services is a burgeoning area of concern. Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and temperatures have important effects on plants, their pollen production, and the consequent burden of atmospheric allergens.5 Seasonal variations and increases in temperature affect the timing of the pollen season for some plants, including starting pollen release earlier and lasting longer. In addition, significant increases in pollen allergenicity have been reported as associated with increasing CO2 and temperature. Climate change can also increase the likelihood of extreme weather events, such as thunderstorms and unseasonal rainfall promoting luxuriant plant growth, alternating with hot dry spells promoting pollen release.5 Air pollution that is also influenced by climate change significantly exacerbates the risk and severity of thunderstorm asthma by interacting with pollen, enhancing respiratory sensitivity, and contributing to a pro-inflammatory state in the lungs.2 Understanding this relationship is crucial for preventing and managing thunderstorm asthma, particularly in urban areas where pollution levels are high. Improved understanding of these risk factors for thunderstorm asthma leads to consideration of the following preventive strategies at the individual, public health and environmental level. For individuals with asthma, access and adherence to an inhaled steroid/fast onset long-acting bronchodilator (ICS/LABA) medication (such as a budesonide and formoterol combination inhaler) during the pollen season should be promoted. Those with allergic rhinitis need to be treated with preventive therapy such as intranasal steroids, with consideration of, and access to ICS/LABA inhalers especially if there are any respiratory symptoms suggestive of latent or undiagnosed asthma. Allergen specific immunotherapy (if available) can also be considered as primary or secondary preventive risk reduction strategies.6 At the public health level, pollen monitoring can facilitate pollen forecasting and warning systems, to allow pollen sensitive individuals to stay indoors and avoid exposure to harmful pollen levels. In the Australian state of Victoria, following the Melbourne 2016 event, a thunderstorm asthma forecasting system during the pollen season has been implemented which combines meteorological and grass pollen forecasts to produce daily forecasts of low, moderate, or high thunderstorm asthma risk. During high-risk days with high airborne pollen concentrations (&gt;50 pollen grains/m3) and severe thunderstorms with strong winds, public health messages are promoted through public and social media to stay indoors, and for those at risk with asthma and allergic rhinitis to have available and take their inhaled/intranasal medication. Health services are also put on alert for thunderstorm asthma outbreak response preparedness. These strategies need to be tailored for particular geographical regions' health system resources and thunderstorm asthma risk profile (Figure 1). Lastly, climate change is a global health concern at multiple levels. There is an urgent need to adapt to and mitigate the effects of climate change on human health. Emissions reduction and air quality improvement (through reducing fossil fuel use and increasing environmental biodiversity and green spaces) and promoting sustainable agricultural practices will help to reduce the impact of climate change.7 The paradigm and catastrophic potential of epidemic thunderstorm asthma emphasises the need to take urgent action in order to write a new ending to an old story.

                There are environmental impacts associated with the construction of necessary infrastructures. Concrete is the most used construction material. To reduce the environmental impact of construction, we can use alternatives to Portland cement and recycled aggregates in concrete production. This study used non-reactive electric arc furnace slag (EAFS) and alkali-activated concrete (AASC). The goal was to reduce CO2 emissions while maintaining desired mechanical and durability properties. Tests showed that the mix designs had excellent properties. Full substitution of aggregates resulted in compressive strength of 47 MPa at 28 days, but a 6% reduction compared to AASC with natural aggregates. This pattern is repeated for other mechanical properties. Substituting all aggregates led to a 30% reduction in water absorption performance compared to AASC with natural aggregates. Choosing sustainable and eco-friendly concrete types can reduce a structure's environmental impact and carbon footprint. This is crucial for a more sustainable future.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Speed Limit Change on Emissions: A Systematic Review of Literature</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16177712</link>

                In the pursuit of sustainable mobility and the decarbonization of transport systems, public authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the impact of travel speed on emissions within both low-speed and high-speed environments. This study critically examines the evidence concerning emission impacts associated with speed limit changes in different traffic environments by conducting a systematic review of the literature in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 25 studies that met the eligibility criteria were assessed. The results reveal mixed evidence for reducing emissions through speed limit reductions in low-speed areas. However, emerging evidence suggests that reduced urban speeds may abate emissions through enhanced traffic flow and a shift in modal preferences away from personal vehicle use. Additionally, in urban areas, minor observed emission reduction per vehicle can add up to large overall reductions due to the high number of vehicles. In high-speed contexts, the evidence is much clearer, showing that reduced speed limits correlate with significant reductions in NOx, CO2, and particulate matter emissions. The extent of these reductions is highly variable and contingent upon the specific speed limits or limit reductions, the local context, the vehicle type, and the baseline types and levels of pollutants. Notably, there is a lack of research on the effects of speed on emissions, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), highlighting a critical area for future investigation. The findings of this study underscore the potential environmental benefits of speed management policies and advocate for the promotion of smoother and less aggressive driving behavior to mitigate emissions and enhance sustainable mobility in both low-speed and high-speed settings.</description>

      <title>Simulating soil atmosphere exchanges and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fluxes for a restored peatland</title>

                Abstract. Restoration of drained and extracted peatlands can potentially return them to carbon (C) sinks, thus acting as significant climate change mitigation. However, whether the restored sites will remain C sinks or switch to sources with a changing climate is unknown. Therefore, we adapted the CoupModel to simulate soil atmosphere exchanges and the associated ecosystem CO2 fluxes of a restored bog. The study site was a peatland in eastern Canada that was extracted for eight years before restoration. The model outputs were first evaluated against three years (representing 14&#8211;16 years post restoration) of eddy covariance measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), surface energy fluxes, soil temperature profiles, and water table depth data. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the response of the simulated CO2 fluxes to the thickness of the newly grown mosses. The validated model was then used to assess the sensitivity of changes in climate forcing. CoupModel reproduced the measured surface energy fluxes and showed high agreement with the observed soil temperature, water table depth, and NEE data. The simulated NEE varied slightly when changing the thickness of newly grown mosses and acrotelm from 0.2 to 0.4 m but showed significantly less uptake for a 1 m thickness. The simulated NEE was -95 &#177; 19 g C m-2 yr-1 over the three evaluation years, and -101 &#177; 64 g C m-2 yr-1, ranging from -219 to +54 g C m-2 yr-1 with an extended 28-year climate data. After 14 years of restoration, the peatland has a mean C uptake rate similar to pristine sites, but with a much larger interannual variability, and under dry years, the restored peatland can switch back to a temporary C source. The model predicts a moderate reduction of CO2 uptake, but still a reasonable sink under future climate change conditions if the peatland is ecologically and hydrologically restored. The ability of CoupModel to simulate the CO2 dynamics and its thermal-hydro drivers for restored peatlands has important implications for emission accounting and climate-smart management of drained peatlands.</description>

      <title>How Clean Can We Get? Technological Change and Renewable Energy Use in Mexico, A General Equilibrium Perspective</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.56476/jed.v49i1.11</link>
      <description>Roy Boyd, Alejandra Elizondo, Mar&#237;a Eugenia Ibarrar&#225;n Viniegra, No host. 49(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402184427

                This study explores the impact of technological change and renewable energy adoption on Mexico's economy using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. As global concerns about climate change intensify, reducing carbon emissions has become a priority, but traditional CGE models often predict significant economic costs associated with fossil fuel restrictions. In this analysis, we modify the conventional CGE framework to incorporate increasing returns to scale and endogenously modeled technological change, reflecting the real-world diffusion of renewable energy technologies in developing countries like Mexico. By accounting for these factors, our model demonstrates that a combined policy of carbon taxation and renewable energy subsidies can achieve significant CO2 reductions without negatively impacting economic welfare. However, while the environmental benefits&#8212;such as reduced emissions of particulates, SO2, and NOx&#8212;are substantial, the overall welfare gains remain modest, and the policy's success depends on effective government implementation and potential trade impacts. These findings offer valuable insights for policymakers in Mexico and other developing nations seeking to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability through strategic carbon emission reduction policies.</description>

      <title>Regional-Scale Assessment of the Potential for Shallow Geothermal Energy Development Using Vertical Ground Source Heat Pumps</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17174363</link>
      <description>Peng Yu, Yufeng Xu, Honghua Liu, Xinyu Liu, Jiani Fu, Meijun Xu, Debao Zhou, Energies. 17(17)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402127745

                Shallow geothermal energy (SGE) is a widely prevalent geological resource underground, and its utilization offer significant energy conservation and emission reduction benefits, contributing to the achievement of carbon neutrality goals. Assessing the development potential of regional SGE can ensure sustainable development of these resources and prevent adverse effects induced by overexploitation. Jiangsu Province, a developed region in the eastern coastal area of China, has a strong demand for cooling and heating in urban buildings. The primary form of utilizing SGE in this area is through vertical ground source heat pumps (VGSHP). Based on the analysis of the impact of regional geological conditions on the development of SGE, this study specifically evaluated the suitability of developing SGE through VGSHP. After excluding areas unsuitable for development, the heat exchange capacity, heating or cooling area per unit area, and energy conservation and emission reduction benefits of VGSHP were calculated. The results indicate that the area suitable and moderately suitable for developing SGE through VGSHP in Jiangsu Province amounts to 76,453 km2. The total heat exchange capacity for summer is 1.21 &#215; 109 kW, which can provide cooling for an area of 1.21 &#215; 1010 m2. The total heat exchange capacity for winter is 8.70 &#215; 108 kW, which can provide heating for an area of 1.09 &#215; 1010 m2. The annual available resource amount is 2.68 &#215; 1012 kWh, equivalent to 3.30 &#215; 108 tons of standard coal, and a CO2 reduction of 7.86 &#215; 108 tons.</description>

                The development of novel materials based on renewable materials with beneficial properties that assist with energy efficiency and conservation has been encouraged by increasing consciousness of environmental issues. This research intends to use sustainable cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) obtained from oil palm empty fruit bunches (OPEFB) as reinforcement to enhance the properties of rigid polyurethane foam (RPUF). RPUF reinforcement with varied CNC concentrations (0.25&#8211;1 wt%) was examined by foaming behavior, surface morphology, mechanical properties, thermal insulation properties, dimensional stability, efficiency energy study, and CO2 reduction through their thermal conductivity values. The results achieved an optimal improvement of mechanical properties of the RPUF composite by around 23.53% compared to RPUF control, at the addition of 0.5 wt% of CNC concentration while maintaining the density of 37&#8211;39 kg/m3. Further, incorporating CNC improved thermal insulating performance by 9.95%, as reflected by decreased thermal conductivity from 0.0292 W/mK to 0.0269 W/mK and decreased cell size by 28.12%. Finally, based on the energy and cost efficiency studies, RPUF-CNC composites offer up to 0.78 kWh/m2 and 0.031 kWh/m2 compared to conventional wall materials made of concrete and wood, respectively. Furthermore, it contributed to reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 110 and 7.2 kg CO2/year compared to concrete and wood, respectively. This work demonstrates the promising use of eco-friendly building insulation materials to mitigate the energy and environmental crisis.</description>

      <title>CHLORIDE-INDUCED CORROSION OF STEEL REBARS IN CONCRETE WITH LOW BINDER CONTENT</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.18552/2024/scmt/136</link>

                To enhance sustainability in the construction sector and reduce CO2 emissions, low-binder concretes arise as an alternative. In this scenario, the use of limestone filler as cement replacement, which is available in a large scale, becomes a suitable alternative. This study evaluates the impact of replacing 30% and 60% of Portland cement by limestone filler on compressive strength, chlorides transport and corrosion propagation in concrete mixtures. The findings reveal that the concretes with low binder contents meet the minimum compressive strength for concrete structures recommended by Brazilian standard. Nevertheless, the reduction in Portland cement content promoted a lower concrete pH and decreased C3A content. This led to higher diffusion coefficients but did not mean a higher content of chlorides accumulated into concrete for C250, which means that, chloride diffusion coefficient needs to be analysed together with other variables and that the performance of low-binder content concretes can be equivalent or even superior in some properties.</description>

      <title>Stakeholder Insights: A Socio-Agronomic Study on Varietal Innovation Adoption, Preferences, and Sustainability in the Arracacha Crop (Arracacia xanthorrhiza B.)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy14091981</link>
      <description>Diego Alberto Navarro-Ni&#241;o, Jorge Enrique Villamil Carvajal, Sonia Mercedes Polo-Murcia, Agronomy. 14(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402134117

                Arracacha, a root crop indigenous to the Andean region of South America, holds significant agronomic and socio-economic importance in Colombia. The study aims to evaluate the impacts of adopting the &#8216;Agrosavia La 22&#8217; variety on agricultural sustainability and productivity, encompassing economic, environmental, and social dimensions. Additionally, it analyzes the preferences of farmers and other stakeholders regarding the sustainability of the introduced technological innovations. Conducted over three years (2021&#8211;2023), the study offers comprehensive insights into adoption trends and stakeholder perceptions. Utilizing the Ambitec-Agro methodology, the research assesses the environmental, social, and economic impacts of &#8216;Agrosavia La 22&#8217;. Data collection involved field observations and interviews with farmers and key actors in the arracacha supply chain. Results indicate a substantial increase in the cultivated area from 1500 hectares in 2021 to 2650 hectares in 2023, with the proportion of total cultivated area rising from 47.6% to 84.1%. Economically, &#8216;Agrosavia La 22&#8217; demonstrated significant input cost savings, reducing costs by USD 347 per hectare by 2023 and enhancing producer surplus from USD 30.95 to USD 651.16 per hectare. Yield comparisons show higher median yields for &#8216;Agrosavia La 22&#8217; (20 t ha&#8722;1 in 2023) compared to traditional varieties (12.5 t ha&#8722;1). Socially, there was a marked improvement in farmers&#8217; income perceptions, and environmentally, there was a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (324.05 kg CO2-eq ha&#8722;1) due to optimized fertilizer and pesticide applications. Eco-efficiency (EE) analysis shows that &#8216;Agrosavia La 22&#8217; consistently demonstrated positive EE values, indicating economic viability alongside lower GHG emissions. In 2021, its EE stood at 2.2 USD/kg CO2-eq, increasing to 27.75 USD/kg CO2-eq by 2023, reflecting substantial economic gains relative to environmental impact. Conversely, the traditional variety initially exhibited lower EE due to high GHG emissions. Challenges such as soil quality decline and market price volatility were noted. Overall, the findings underscore the economic, social, and environmental benefits of &#8216;Agrosavia La 22&#8217;. Furthermore, the methodology used in this study can be applied to the evaluation of other varietal innovations in developing countries with limited resources for assessing agricultural technology impacts.</description>

      <title>Preparation of Metallized Pellets for Steelmaking by Hydrogen Cooling Reduction with Different Cooling Rates</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17174362</link>
      <description>Guanwen Luo, Zhiwei Peng, Kewei Gao, Wanlong Fan, Ran Tian, Lingyun Yi, Mingjun Rao, Materials. 17(17)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402171348

                To utilize the sensible heat of hot roasted iron ore pellets with no CO2 emission in the production of metallized pellets for direct steelmaking, the pellets were reduced in H2 during their cooling process with variable cooling rates. When the cooling rate decreased from 5.2 &#176;C/min to 2.0 &#176;C/min, the total iron content, reduction degree, and iron metallization degree of the pellets increased continuously from 74.0 wt%, 52%, and 31.1% to 84.9 wt%, 93.4%, and 89.2%, respectively. However, the compressive strength of the pellets increased initially from 2100 N/p to 2436 N/p and then decreased considerably to 841 N/p. As the cooling rate decreased, more Fe2O3 was reduced to Fe with diminishing FeO and Fe2SiO4. The porosity of the pellets increased from 23.9% to 54.3%, with higher distribution uniformity of pores. The morphology of metallic iron particles also transited from a layered form to a spherical form and lastly to a porous reticular form. Meanwhile, the metallic iron particles in the pellets grew evidently with more uniform distributions. When the cooling rate was 3.7 &#176;C/min, the resulting metallized pellets had the reduction degree of 74.2%, iron metallization degree of 66.9%, and the highest compressive strength of 2436 N/p, in association with the spherical morphology and relatively large size of metallic iron particles.</description>

      <title>Successful bevacizumab therapy in a 25-year-old patient with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.12890/2024_004840</link>
      <description>Gita Dambrova, Zaiga Kravale, Dace &#381;enti&#326;a, A. Krumina, European Journal of Case Reports in Internal Medicine. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402311660

                Background: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a chronic condition caused primarily by human papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11, leading to recurrent growths in the respiratory tract. These types of papilloma can cause significant morbidity due to airway obstruction, often requiring frequent surgical interventions. Traditional treatments, including surgical removal and adjunctive therapies like antivirals and immune modulators, often fail to prevent recurrence, impacting the patient&#8217;s quality of life. Case description: This report presents a 25-year-old female with a long-standing history of RRP, diagnosed at age 2. Despite numerous interventions, including CO2 laser ablations, interferon therapy, HPV vaccination, and a laryngotomy with tracheal reconstruction, the patient continued to experience severe airway obstruction requiring frequent surgeries. In 2023, intravenous therapy with bevacizumab, vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor was introduced, leading to a significant reduction in the frequency of surgical interventions from 8 to 4 per year. This reduction improved the patient&#8217;s respiratory function and quality of life, highlighting bevacizumab&#8217;s therapeutic potential. Conclusion: The case underscores the debilitating nature of RRP and the challenges of its management. Bevacizumab, by targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has shown promise in reducing papilloma growth and the need for frequent surgeries. This case supports the inclusion of bevacizumab as an adjunctive therapy in RRP treatment, warranting further research to confirm its long-term efficacy and safety.</description>

      <title>The Mechanism of Sodium Sulfate Coupled with Anaerobic Methane Oxidation Mitigating Methane Production in Beef Cattle</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms12091825</link>
      <description>Xiaowen Zhu, Zhiyu Zhou, Yang Cheng, Ziqi Deng, Hao Wu, Luiz Gustavo Nussio, Zhenming Zhou, Qingxiang Meng, Microorganisms. 12(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402186927

                The aim of this experiment is to explore the effect of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) on methane reduction in the rumen, and its impact on anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME). Using mixed rumen fluid from four Angus cattle fistulas, this study conducted an in vitro fermentation. Adding Na2SO4 to the fermentation substrate resulted in sulfur concentrations in the substrate of 0.4%, 0.6%, 0.8%, 1.0%, 1.2%, 1.4%, 1.6%, 1.8%, 2.0%, 2.2%, and 2.4%. The gas production rate and methane yield were measured using an in vitro gas production method. Subsequently, the fermentation fluid was collected to determine the fermentation parameters. The presence of ANME in the fermentation broth, as well as the relationship between the number of bacteria, archaea, sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), ANME, and the amount of Na2SO4 added to the substrate, were measured using qPCR. The results showed that: (1) the addition of Na2SO4 could significantly reduce CH4 production and was negatively correlated with CO2 production; (2) ANME-1 and ANME-2c did exist in the fermentation broth; (3) the total number of archaea, SRB, ANME-1, and ANME-2c increased with the elevation of Na2SO4. The above results indicated that Na2SO4 could mitigate methane production via sulfate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation (S-DAMO) in the rumen. In the future management of beef cattle, including sodium sulfate in their diet can stimulate S-DAMO activity, thereby promoting a reduction in methane emissions.</description>

                China is undergoing a significant transition as it modernizes its energy consumption system and changes its approach to economic development. However, this transformation comes at the expense of environmental quality. The utilization of technological innovation has emerged as a significant catalyst for China's pursuit of environmentally conscious and sustainable development. Accordingly, this study utilizes panel data from 30 Chinese provinces spanning the years 1997-2021. The research employs the MMQR and BSQR to conduct an empirical analysis to find the influence of energy consumption (EC) and technological innovation (TI) on environmental degradation (ED). The findings of the research indicate that EC is a prominent manifestation of ED, while TI contributes negatively to ED. The inclusion of an interaction term suggests that the relationship between TI and ED can be influenced by the extent to which energy conservation and emission reduction are improved. The study's conclusion revealed that economic growth, population, and industrial structure are positively associated with CO2 emissions in China. This study offers a set of recommendations for policymakers to formulate policies related to environmental quality.</description>

      <title>Cradle to gate life-cycle assessment of battery grade nickel sulphate production through high-pressure acid leaching</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.175902</link>
      <description>Georgios Bartzas, Kostas Komnitsas, The Science of The Total Environment. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402127330

                The rising global demand for high-purity nickel (Ni) sulphate, primarily used in lithium-ion batteries, is largely met by processing Indonesian laterite ores via hydrometallurgy. However, this supply chain is associated with significant environmental challenges and lack of transparent industrial data. This study uses a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to quantify the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use associated with the production of mixed hydroxide precipitate (MHP) from low-grade Indonesian laterites via high-pressure acid leaching (HPAL), which is then refined in China for the production of battery-grade nickel sulphate hexahydrate (NiSO4&#183;6H2O, NSH). Fifteen impact categories are analyzed using established impact assessment and allocation (mass and economic) methods. The analysis reveals that feed preparation/HPAL and purification are the stages that contribute most to environmental impacts and in particular to global warming potential (GWP). Mass allocation results in higher environmental impacts, with 36.8 kg CO2-eq per 1 kg of Ni in NSH for GWP, compared to 33.8 kg CO2-eq per 1 kg of Ni in NSH when economic allocation is used. Sensitivity analysis shows a potential reduction (up to 13 %) in key impact categories if production of NSH is fully integrated in Indonesia or a greener electricity mix is used. Overall, our results indicate that the production of MHP in Indonesia and its refinement to NSH in China has a GWP about two times higher than the global average. Given the limited number of LCA studies for the production of battery-grade nickel, this study highlights major environmental concerns for the NSH production process from Indonesian laterites and identifies opportunities for improvement, towards a more sustainable global battery supply chain.</description>

      <title>Determinants of Hotel Business Success in Rural Areas of the Western Balkan Countries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16177704</link>
      <description>Miroslav Pimi&#263;, Zoran Simonovi&#263;, Nikola Radivojevi&#263;, Iuliana Nicolae, Nikola &#262;ur&#269;i&#263;, Sustainability. 16(17)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402283450

                This paper examines the impact of ten microeconomic factors on hotel business success. This research encompassed a sample of 115 small, family-operated hotels situated in rural regions of the Western Balkan countries (WBC). This research was based on the assumption that factors such as the size of the hotel, age, solvency, liquidity, labour productivity, capital productivity, CSR, and reduction of CO2 emissions exhibit a positive influence on business success, whereas leverage, indebtedness, and energy consumption have a negative effect on the business success of hotels. The findings revealed that business success from the previous period, size, liquidity, and CSR exhibit a positive influence on business success, whereas leverage, capital productivity, and indebtedness demonstrate a negative effect. Conversely, the age of the hotel and labour productivity were not found to significantly influence business success, as did energy consumption. In the context of sustainable development, a positive CSR impact means that tourists value this behaviour of the hotel, while a lack of a statistically significant impact of energy consumption implies either that hotels do not implement efficient measures of energy efficiency or that energy efficiency may not be a crucial factor in attracting guests or influencing their loyalty. The findings also show that labour productivity expressed conventionally does not have a statistically significant impact on hotel business success. However, when expressed in a way that respects the concept of sustainable development and CSR, workforce productivity is a significant factor in hotel business success. Due to the problem of multicollinearity, the influence of CO2 emissions was not examined. The findings suggest the following two groups of key measures: 1. Policymakers must work on ensuring more favourable conditions under which hotels can borrow, as well as on ensuring adequate infrastructure; 2. They must work on improving the strategy for maintaining liquidity to avoid the high costs of short-term loans and increasing size in order to further utilise economies of scale. These two microeconomic factors have the greatest impact on the business success of hotels.</description>

      <title>Life-Cycle Assessment and Environmental Costs of Cement-Based Materials Manufactured with Mixed Recycled Aggregate and Biomass Ash</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17174357</link>
      <description>Francisco Agrela, Manuel Rosales, M&#243;nica L&#243;pez-Alonso, Javier Ord&#243;&#241;ez, Gloria M. Cuenca-Moyano, Materials. 17(17)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402191586

                The development of new building elements, such as concrete and mortar with sustainable materials, which produce a lower carbon footprint, is an achievable milestone in the short term. The need to reduce the environmental impact of the production of cement-based materials is of vital importance. This work focuses on the evaluation of the life-cycle assessment, production costs, mechanical performance, and durability of three mortars and three concrete mixtures in which mixed recycled aggregates (MRAs) and biomass bottom ash from olive waste (oBBA) were included to replace cement and aggregates. Powdered MRA and oBBA were also applied as complementary cementitious materials with a reduced environmental footprint. Chemical and physical tests were performed on the materials, and mechanical performance properties, life-cycle assessment, and life-cycle cost analysis were applied to demonstrate the technical and environmental benefits of using these materials in mortar and concrete mixtures. This research showed that the application of MRA and oBBA produced a small reduction in mechanical strength but a significant benefit in terms of life-cycle population and environmental costs. The results demonstrated that finding long-term mechanical strength decreases between 2.7% and 14% for mortar mixes and between 1.7% and 10.4% for concrete mixes. Although there were small reductions in mechanical performance, the savings in environmental and monetary terms make the feasibility of manufacturing these cement-based materials feasible and interesting for both society and the business world. CO2 emissions are reduced by 25% for mortar mixes and 12% for concrete mixes with recycled materials, and it is possible to reduce the cost per cubic meter of mortar production by 20%, and the savings in the cost of production of a cubic meter of concrete is 13.8%.</description>

                Today, economic development is inseparably linked with global environmental problems. So, the search for their solutions without adverse influence on economic growth became relevant. The energy transition can ambiguously affect the pace and dynamics of economic growth. The purpose of this work is to identify the influence of the dynamics of investment in renewable energy on economic growth for groups of developed and developing countries and verification of the following hypotheses: for developing countries, the growth of investments in the renewable energy stimulates economic growth. For developed countries, the growth of investments in the renewable energy inhibits economic growth. Research results: with an increase in the share of income invested in the capital of renewable energy by 1% in developed countries the rate of economic growth will decrease by 0.0001%; while in developing countries &#8212; will increase by 0.0001%. The indicated reduction in the rate of economic growth for developed countries can be considered as a &#8220;payment&#8221; for the preference of the future state of ecology before the current receipt of additional release. As for developing countries, the energy transition positively affects the pace of economic growth. The fourth energy transition is a solution for global environmental problems caused by the CO2 emissions. The fourth energy transition based on the expansion of renewable energy sources and the displacement of fossil fuel is necessary since it is important for sustainable development of current and future generations.</description>

                ABSTRACT Talinum fruticosum is a species confirmed to occur in the semi-arid region, considered an unconventional food plant with a high protein content and tolerant to temporary periods of water restriction. This study aimed to evaluate water deficit as a strategy for growing Talinum fruticosum, covering physiological and biochemical aspects. The experimental design adopted was entirely randomized, using six treatments and eight replications. The treatments were defined as water availability (WA) 0 (no water replenishment), 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100%, conducted in a greenhouse, with water replenishment every 7 days. After 21 days, the centesimal composition, water relations, gas exchange, and biochemical aspects were evaluated. The energy value of the dry biomass of T. fruticosum leaves was directly influenced by the water content in the soil, and the water deficit led to an increase in protein. Water restriction compromised the species' water status and performance, mainly limiting gas exchange by reducing the water content in the soil, compromising CO2 gain. It also led to increased biomolecules, with the highest contents seen in the treatments without water replacement (0%) and for 20% WA. Therefore, reducing the WA to 40% could be a strategy adopted to increase the protein content in the leaves of T. fruticosum, promoting an increase in the centesimal composition of proteins, a reduction in gas exchange, and an increase in the content of biomolecules.</description>

                The multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) alcohols produced by electrochemical CO2 reduction, such as ethanol and n&#8208;propanol, are considered as indispensable liquid energy carriers. In most C&#8211;C coupling cases, however, the concomitant gaseous C2H4 product results in the low selectivity of C2+ alcohols. Here, we report rational construction of mesostructured CuO electrocatalysts, specifically mesoporous CuO (m&#8208;CuO) and cylindrical CuO (c&#8208;CuO), enables selective distribution of C2+ products. The m&#8208;CuO and c&#8208;CuO showed similar selectivity towards total C2+ products (&#8805;76%), but the corresponding predominant products were C2+ alcohols (55%) and C2H4 (52%), respectively. The ordered mesostructure not only induced the surface hydrophobicity, but selectively tailored the adsorption configuration of *CO intermediate: m&#8208;CuO preferred bridged adsorption, whereas c&#8208;CuO favored top adsorption as revealed by in situ spectroscopies. Computational calculations unraveled that bridged *CO adsorbate is prone to deep protonation into *OCH3 intermediate, thus accelerating the coupling of *CO and *OCH3 intermediates to generate C2+ alcohols; by contrast, top *CO adsorbate is apt to undergo the favorable conventional C&#8211;C coupling process to produce C2H4. This work illustrates selective C2+ products distribution via mesostructure manipulation, and paves new path into the design of efficient electrocatalysts with tunable adsorption configuration of key intermediates for targeted products.</description>

                ABSTRACT Arugula is a vegetable with considerable prominence in the commercial sector, so knowing the ideal dose of fertigation and the effects of soil salinity on its agronomic characteristics is essential for good production. The aim of the study was to evaluate the morphological and physiological aspects of arugula, cultivar Broadleaf, at different levels of soil salinity and doses of fertilization via fertigation. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse during two consecutive growing cycles, from May to June and from July to August 2021. The experimental design used was randomized blocks, arranged in a 4 x 3 factorial scheme, with four replicates. Treatments consisted of four levels of electrical conductivity of the saturated extract (ECse = 0.57, 1.3, 2.3, and 3.3 dS m-1) and three doses of fertilization via fertigation (F1= 100%, F2= 50%, and F3= 25% of the recommended NPK doses). The variables analyzed were: plant height (cm), number of leaves, leaf area (m2 plant-1), shoot fresh mass and shoot dry mass (g plant-1), leaf water percentage, SPAD, and gas exchange (photosynthesis, transpiration, stomatal conductance, and internal CO2 concentration). There was a reduction in arugula growth in soil with ECse above 2.1 dS m-1. Fertigation using the full dose of fertilizer recommended for arugula cultivation proved to be an effective strategy for increasing both biomass production and physiological activity.</description>

      <title>Environmental issue of sustainable textile industry: Examples of good manufacturing practices</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5937/ct_iti24060z</link>
      <description>Darja B. &#381;arkovi&#263;, Marija Vu&#269;i&#263;evi&#263;, Milica Vlahovi&#263;, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402323931

                Growing impact on the environment and the rising demand for water, energy and raw materials that has resulted from the worldwide expansion of industry, put the principles of sustainability and cleaner production in a front line, as emergent activity. The textile industry consumes a high amount of energy and generates an enormous quantity of wastewater-worldwide, it generates 20 % of industrial wastewater and 8 % of greenhouse gas (GHG), while cotton production uses large amounts of pesticides, water and fertilizers. Many aspects of sustainable textile industry are not related only to production process itself (product quality and its market price, production process, supply of raw materials and its costs), but also to nus products, energy and water consumption, equipment service time, occupational health, and environmental issue. Thus, successful companies in textile production are driven by the basic principles of sustainable development and implementation of good manufacturing practice and cleaner production principles. This paper presents main principles of environmental protection in textile industry to be adopted toward sustainable production; these principles consider minimization of water, energy, virgin raw materials and chemicals usage, which results in reduction of the CO2 emissions, toward climate neutral production and business. Described company increases the share of sustainable/renewable materials and recycled materials, by accomplishing its own sustainability goals concerning environmental issue.</description>

                The power generation sector significantly contributes to climate change. Mitigation efforts are crucial to adhering to the global commitment to limit temperature increases below 2&#176;C. One potential solution is retrofitting existing power plants with technologies that integrate renewable energy. This study explores the integration of solar energy into the operational processes of a coal-fired power plant in Central Kalimantan, replacing the extraction steam turbine in the high-pressure feed water heater No. 7. Using STEAG EBSILON for simulation, this research evaluates the power plant's performance before and after retrofitting in both power-boost (PB) and fuel-save (FS) modes under varying load conditions. The results demonstrate that thermal efficiency in both PB and FS modes increased by up to 2% compared to the base scenario. Specific fuel consumption decreased by 15.05 g/kWh in PB mode and 15.75 g/kWh in FS mode, leading to a reduction in coal consumption and CO2 emissions by 4.69% and 4.94% respectively. Additionally, the study observed that the solar percentage and solar-to-electricity efficiency increased as the load decreased. In FS mode, the solar electricity proportions at VWO, 100%, 75%, and 50% load rates were 5.23%, 5.53%, 7.76%, and 11.92%, respectively. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for solar electricity was calculated to be 431.82 IDR/kWh, with an expected investment return period of 5.87 years.</description>

      <title>Environmental Benefits of Circular Ethylene Production from Polymer Waste</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c04241</link>

                The linear nature of the current plastics economy and increasing demand for polymers poses a pressing global problem. In this work, we explore the environmental and economic performance of a circular alternative for polymer production through chemical plastic recycling following the waste-to-methanol-to-olefins (WMO) route. We assess the life-cycle environmental impacts and techno-economic feasibility of this novel circular production route (CPR) in 2020 and 2050, and compare them to the existing linear production route (LPR), deploying naphtha steam cracking for olefin production, and a mix of landfill and incineration as end-of-life treatment. Our results showcase that CPR could enable significant impact reductions, notably in 2050 assuming a low-carbon electricity mix based on renewables. However, the shift from linear to circular comes with burden-shifting, increasing the impacts relative to LPR on five environmental indicators in 2020 (i.e., terrestrial and freshwater eutrophication, particulate matter formation, acidification, and metal/mineral resources use). From the techno-economic viewpoint, we found that ethylene from waste polymers could become competitive with fossil ethylene when deployed at large scale. Moreover, it is significantly cheaper than its green analogs, which deploy methanol-to-olefins with green methanol from captured CO2 and electrolytic H2, showcasing the potential of implementing high-readiness level technologies to close the loop for polymers.</description>

                The fast fashion industry has a significant impact on the environment at every stage of the product life cycle. There is a lack of research in the literature on the impact of fast fashion on the environment through logistics and transport. In this area, the greatest environmental impact is caused by air emissions, which is very important from the point of view of climate change. Therefore, this article deals with the analysis of the carbon footprint resulting from the fast fashion logistics process. The identification and assessment of fast fashion companies&amp;#039; sustainability efforts in the area of transport-related emissions and sustainable transformation strategies was conducted using a case study method for selected brands (H&amp;amp;M Group; Inditex, Shein). The study uses secondary data available in non-financial reports from 2023. After analyzing the data and content in non-financial reports on transport-related emissions, sev-eral important conclusions emerge. As a dominant practice, companies emphasize their reliance on external frameworks and standards, in particular the Global Reporting Initiative and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Companies prioritize reducing emissions from significant factors, such as production processes. The data disclosed in the reports (scope 1, 2, 3) are not clearly formulated, but they can be used to calculate the level of CO2 emission reduction/increase. The ar-ticle contains recommendations for companies to improve their reporting by including additional indicators expressing the efficiency of transport-related emissions.</description>

                Importance Impaired exercise capacity is a cardinal manifestation of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). The Phase 3 Trial to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Aficamten Compared to Placebo in Adults With Symptomatic Obstructive HCM (SEQUOIA-HCM) is a pivotal study characterizing the treatment effect of aficamten, a next-in-class cardiac myosin inhibitor, on a comprehensive set of exercise performance and clinical measures. Objective To evaluate the effect of aficamten on exercise performance using cardiopulmonary exercise testing with a novel integrated measure of maximal and submaximal exercise performance and evaluate other exercise measures and clinical correlates. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a prespecified analysis from SEQUOIA-HCM, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Patients were recruited from 101 sites in 14 countries (North America, Europe, Israel, and China). Individuals with symptomatic obstructive HCM with objective exertional intolerance (peak oxygen uptake [pVO 2 ] &#8804;90% predicted) were included in the analysis. Data were analyzed from January to March 2024. Interventions Randomized 1:1 to aficamten (5-20 mg daily) or matching placebo for 24 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was change from baseline to week 24 in integrated exercise performance, defined as the 2-component z score of pVO 2 and ventilatory efficiency throughout exercise (minute ventilation [VE]/carbon dioxide output [VCO 2 ] slope). Response rates for achieving clinically meaningful thresholds for change in pVO 2 and correlations with clinical measures of treatment effect (health status, echocardiographic/cardiac biomarkers) were also assessed. Results Among 282 randomized patients (mean [SD] age, 59.1 [12.9] years; 115 female [40.8%], 167 male [59.2%]), 263 (93.3%) had core laboratory&#8211;validated exercise testing at baseline and week 24. Integrated composite exercise performance improved in the aficamten group (mean [SD] z score, 0.17 [0.51]) from baseline to week 24, whereas the placebo group deteriorated (mean [SD] z score, &#8722;0.19 [0.45]), yielding a placebo-corrected improvement of 0.35 (95% CI, 0.25-0.46; P &amp;amp;lt;.001). Further, aficamten treatment demonstrated significant improvements in total workload, circulatory power, exercise duration, heart rate reserve, peak heart rate, ventilatory efficiency, ventilatory power, and anaerobic threshold (all P &amp;amp;lt;.001). In the aficamten group, large improvements (&#8805;3.0 mL/kg per minute) in pVO 2 were more common than large reductions (32% and 2%, respectively) compared with placebo (16% and 11%, respectively). Improvements in both components of the primary outcome, pVO 2 and VE/VCO 2 slope throughout exercise, were significantly correlated with improvements in symptom burden and hemodynamics (all P &amp;amp;lt;.05). Conclusions and Relevance This prespecified analysis of the SEQUOIA-HCM randomized clinical trial found that aficamten treatment improved a broad range of exercise performance measures. These findings offer valuable insight into the therapeutic effects of aficamten. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05186818</description>

                The heavy metal and soluble salt content in municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWI FA) negatively affects the leaching safety of cementitious material, thereby impacting their corrosion resistance and durability. In this study, an MSWI FA washing pretreatment was conducted to obtain WFA1, and a low-carbon, low-cost cementitious material (FBM) was prepared in combination with bottom ash (BA). The optimal ratio parameters determined through orthogonal experiments were a mass ratio of 51% blast furnace slag (BFS), 17% BA, 20% WFA1, and 12% flue gas desulfurized gypsum (FGDG). The FBM containing WFA1 exhibited strong macroscopic performance, with a compressive strength of 37.42 MPa for FB2 at 28 days. The leaching concentrations of Pb, Zn, As, and Cd met the standards for underground Class II water quality. The leaching concentrations of Cl&#8211; and SO42&#8211; were in the ranges of 90&#8211;200 mg/L and 20&#8211;100 mg/L, respectively. The reduction in the BFS/BA ratio led to decreased polymerization degree (RBO=0.310) and chain length (MCL=2.627) of C&#8211;(A)&#8211;S&#8211;H gel, along with a decrease in Al [VI] content in ettringite (22.63%). Furthermore, Cl&#8211; played a stronger role than SO42&#8211; in the generation of Friedel's salt. The economic benefit of producing one ton of FB2 was calculated to be 38.60 USD, with CO2 emission of only 10.97 kg. The ultimate aim of this study was for waste-generating enterprises to achieve internal synergy in the disposal of solid and hazardous waste, thereby creating a "zero-waste company and group."</description>

                The fast fashion industry significantly impacts the environment at every stage of, a product&#8217;s life cycle. The transport of products to wholesalers and stores, as one of the stages of the product life cycle, is often overlooked during the analysis of their carbon footprint. Therefore, research is needed on the impact of fast fashion on the environment through its logistics and transport, especially in relation to air emissions. This article attempts to determine how extensively fast fashion companies disclose the impact of their transport operations on their overall corporate carbon footprint, determine the proportion of total emissions attributed to transport, and evaluate the effectiveness of companies&#8217; efforts to mitigate their transport-related environmental impact. This research used a case study method on selected brands (H&amp;M Group, Inditex, Shein), using secondary data available in non-financial reports for 2023. As a result of the analysis of their non-financial reports on transport emissions, several key findings have been presented. Companies predominantly rely on external frameworks and standards, particularly the Global Reporting Initiative. However, the level of detail of the data presented varies. The priority for the surveyed companies is to reduce emissions from significant sources, such as production processes. The data disclosed in the reports (scope 1, 2, 3) must be clearly formulated and can be used to calculate the level of their CO2 emission reduction or increase. Companies should improve their environmental reporting by including indicators of their transport-related emissions. This approach provides a comprehensive view of their environmental impact, highlighting absolute values and efficiency metrics.</description>

      <title>Effects of Different Straw Return Modes on Soil Carbon, Nitrogen, and Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the Semiarid Maize Field</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/plants13172503</link>
      <description>Hua Lu, Zhenxing Yang, Wenqian Li, Yidong Zhao, Jie Xia, Wenyi Dong, Baoqing Chen, Plants. 13(17)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402316776

                Returning straw to the field is a crucial practice for enhancing soil quality and increasing efficient use of secondary crop products. However, maize straw has a higher carbon-to-nitrogen ratio compared to other crops. This can result in crop nitrogen loss when the straw is returned to the field. Therefore, it is crucial to explore how different methods of straw return affect maize (Zea mays L.) farmland. In this study, a field experiment was performed with three treatments (I, no straw returned, CK; II, direct straw return, SR; and III, straw returned in deep furrows, ISR) to explore the effects of the different straw return modes on soil carbon and nitrogen content and greenhouse gas emissions. The results indicated that the SR and ISR treatments increased the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content in the topsoil (0&#8211;15 cm). Additionally, the ISR treatment boosted the contents of total nitrogen (TN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3&#8722;-N), ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), and DOC in the subsurface soil (15&#8211;30 cm) compared with CK. When it comes to greenhouse gas emissions, the ISR treatment led to an increase in CO2 emissions. However, SR and ISR reduced N2O emissions, with ISR showing a more pronounced reduction. The ISR treatment significantly increased leaf and grain biomass compared to CK and SR. The correlation analyses showed that the yield was positively correlated with soil DOC, and soil greenhouse gas emission was correlated with soil NO3&#8722;-N. The ISR technology has great potential in sequestering soil organic matter, improving soil fertility, and realizing sustainable agricultural development.</description>

      <title>Exogenous Melatonin Alleviates Osmotic Stress by Enhancing Antioxidant Metabolism, Photosynthetic Maintenance, and Hormone Homeostasis in Forage Oat (Avena sativa) Seedlings</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/grasses3030014</link>
      <description>Jingbo Yu, Xingyu Luo, Qin Zhou, Zhou Li, Shiyong Chen, Grasses. 3(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402185347

                Melatonin (MT) is a multifunctional hormone that enhances crop resilience against various abiotic stresses. However, its regulatory mechanism of osmotic tolerance in forage oats (Avena sativa) plants under water-limited scenarios is still unclear. This study aimed to delineate the impact of MT pretreatment on the morphological, physiological, and biochemical functions of oat seedlings under osmotic stress. Our findings demonstrated that exogenous treatment of MT noticeably elevated leaf area while decreasing the root/shoot ratio of oat seedlings subjected to osmotic stress. Osmotic-induced 38.22% or 48.37% decrease in relative water content could be significantly alleviated by MT pretreatment on day 7 or day 14, respectively. MT treatment also significantly mitigated osmotic-induced decreases in photosynthetic parameters including net photosynthetic rate, stomatic conductance, and intercellular CO2 concentration as well as various chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, which could contribute to enhanced accumulations of free proline and soluble sugars in seedlings after being subjected to a prolonged duration of osmotic stress. Furthermore, MT markedly improved antioxidant enzyme activities including superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, and peroxidase along with the accumulation of ascorbic acid contributing to a significant reduction in reactive oxygen species under osmotic stress. In addition, the MT application induced a 978.12%, 33.54%, or 30.59% increase in endogenous MT, indole acetic acid, or gibberellic acid content under osmotic stress but did not affect the accumulation of abscisic acid. These findings suggest that an optimal concentration of MT (100 &#956;mol&#183;L&#8722;1) could relieve osmotic stress via improvement in osmotic adjustment, the enzymatic antioxidant defense system, and endogenous hormonal balance, thereby contributing to enhanced photosynthetic functions and growth of oat seedlings under water-limited conditions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Oil Recovery Techniques in Low Permeability Unconventional Shale Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3997/1365-2397.fb2024078</link>
      <description>H. Kazemi, Luis E. Zerpa, Ilker Ozan Uzun, Kaveh Amini, Asm Kamruzzaman, First Break. 42(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402202824

                Oil and gas production from very low permeability shale reservoirs became a reality in the 1990s when Mitchel Energy developed novel fracking techniques, but the road ahead was very challenging until around 2008 when oil and gas production from low permeability shale reservoirs became a significant component of total oil and gas production in the US The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that in 2023, about 3.04 billion barrels (or about 8.32 million barrels per day) of crude oil were produced directly from tight-oil resources in the United States. This was equal to about 64% of total US crude oil production in 2023. Also, the current ultimate amount of oil production from such reservoirs is in the range of 3 to 8% of the in-place oil. Furthermore, the production rates from such reservoirs decline rapidly; thus, there is a compelling need for techniques to produce at least some of the enormous amounts of the remaining reservoir oil. The classical waterflooding or gas flooding used in conventional reservoirs is not plausible in unconventional shale reservoirs because the injection fluid displacement velocities are extremely small which prohibits oil displacement through any injection-production well pattern. Therefore, creative and imaginative approaches are needed to increase oil production without relying on injecting large quantities of water or gas to produce additional incremental oil. The current techniques include two vastly different cyclic injection-production methods&#8212;known as the huff-n-puff process. The first method involves injecting either CO2 or rich gas in a multi-stage, hydraulically fractured, production well and soaking for a few days, then producing the same well which generally would yield substantially increased oil flow rates. The second method involves injecting low concentrations of aqueous solutions containing surfactants or mutual solvents. This method is also applied as a huff-n-puff process similar to the gas injection huff-n-puff process. The gas injection huff-n-puff process requires expensive high-pressure injection compressors while solvent injection huff-n-puff requires simpler and less expensive water injection pumps. The mechanism of oil mobilisation by gas injection is generally due to mass transfer across gas-oil interface by molecular diffusion resulting in oil swelling, miscibility, viscosity reduction, and favourable shift in residual oil saturation in the oil relative permeability function. On the other hand oil mobilisation by surfactant solutions or mutual solvents includes reduction of the oil-water interfacial tension in the surfactant case, wettability alteration by surfactant and mutual solvents, and shift in residual oil saturation in the relative permeability function. Additionally, using a brine containing a mutual solvent or a surfactant results in substantial additional oil recovery first by cleaning the micro- and macro-fracture flow paths in the stimulated reservoir volume followed by changes in IFT, wettability, and irreducible oil solubilisation. In this paper we will present laboratory results, mathematical modelling concepts, and field results to illustrate each of the above processes.</description>

      <title>Do Different Amounts of Exogenous Surfactant Differently Influence Cerebrovascular Instability in a Consecutive Group of Preterm Babies? Preliminary Results from a Single-Center Experience</title>

                Background: Thirty years ago, the first attempt by Saliba and colleagues was made to reduce the negative effects (hypercarbia) of exogenous surfactant (ES) by slowing its administration. Sixteen years later, we observed the first less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) attempt by Kribs and colleagues. Many studies, since that time, have tried to minimize the invasiveness of ES and subsequent cerebral blood flow perturbations through studies using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). We sought to address this medical challenge by identifying a less problematic modality of ES administration by delivering multiple aliquots of ES instead of a single one, as typically performed. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that a different way of administering ES using more aliquots could be a safe alternative that should be assessed in further studies. Methods: Patients between 26 + 0 and 35 + 6 weeks of gestational age (GA) requiring ES administration were enrolled (April 2023&#8211;February 2024). Differently fractioned doses were delivered according to an arbitrary standard dosage (0.3 mL per aliquot in babies &lt; 29 weeks; 0.6 mL in babies &#8805; 29 weeks), while NIRS and transcutaneous CO2 (tCO2) monitoring were always performed. ES&#8217;s effectiveness was assessed based on the reduction in the Oxygen Saturation Index (OSI) after administration. Persistent desaturation, bradycardia, and airway obstruction were defined as adverse effects and used to evaluate safety during ES administration, as well as variability in NIRS-rSO2 values and tCO2. Results: Twenty-four patients were enrolled with a median GA of 29 weeks (IQR 4.5) and BW of 1223 &#177; 560 g. In addition, 50% of the cohort received fewer than three aliquots, whereas the other 50% received more than three. Monitoring was started before the procedure and continued 30&#8242; after the last ES aliquot administration. The variability in NIRS-SpO2 values was significantly higher in the group (p = 0.007) with a lower number of aliquots administered. Similarly, increased NIRS-rSO2 values (p = 0.003) and increased tCO2 levels (p = 0.005) were observed in infants who underwent an ES split after the administration of a low number of aliquots. Conclusions: Our data obtained from the group with &gt; 3 fractionated doses of ES seem to justify the preparation of a more robust study, as the combination of reduced NIRS variability and reduced tCO2 maximum levels is consistent with more stable cerebral blood flow during the challenging time of ES administration.</description>
