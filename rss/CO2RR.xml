                Silver is one of the most studied electrode materials for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide, a product with many industrial applications. There is a growing number of reports in which silver is implemented in gas diffusion electrodes as part of a large-scale device to develop commercially relevant technology. Electrochemical models are expected to guide the design and operation toward cost-efficient devices. Despite decades of investigations, there are still uncertainties in the way this reaction should be modeled due to the absence of scientific consensus regarding the reaction mechanism and the nature of the rate-determining step. We review previously reported studies to draw converging conclusions on the value of the Tafel slope and existing species at the electrode surface. We also list conflicting experimental observations and provide leads to tackling these remaining questions.</description>

      <title>Supported tetra-atom clusters on g-CN as catalysts for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to formate: A computational study</title>

                Single-cluster catalysts (SCCs) have emerged as highly efficient catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), providing a promising avenue to solve the carbon dilemma. Based on density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigated the capability of 12 tetra-atom transitional-metal clusters anchored on g-CN (TM4@g-CN) for CO2RR and found that all clusters have good stability on the substrate. Notably, the charge variation of the top metal atom (TM4) of six SCCs is close to zero which makes them readily donate electrons to the adsorbate CO2 and subsequent reaction intermediates. Our results demonstrate that CO2 can be efficiently reduced to HCOOH on Ni4, Cu4, and Au4@g-CN with low limiting potentials of &#8722;0.21, &#8722;0.22, and &#8722;0.19 V, respectively, outperforming the corresponding single-atom counterparts. Both &#916;G(&#8727;CO2) and &#916;G(&#8727;OCHO/&#8727;COOH) exhibit a volcano relationship with the reaction activity, and the TM4 serves as electron reservoirs throughout the entire reaction process. This work offers valuable insights for the advancement of cost-effective supported single cluster catalysts.</description>

      <title>Density Functional Study of Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction in Fourth-Period Transition Metal&#8211;Tetrahydroxyquinone Organic Framework</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29102320</link>
      <description>Yufeng Wen, Xianshi Zeng, Yanan Xiao, Rong Wen, Kai Xiong, Zhangli Lai, Molecules/Molecules online/Molecules annual. 29(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396928519

                This study investigates the utilisation of organometallic network frameworks composed of fourth-period transition metals and tetrahydroxyquinone (THQ) in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed in analysing binding energies, as well as the stabilities of metal atoms within the THQ frameworks, for transition metal TM-THQs ranging from Y to Cd. The findings demonstrate how metal atoms could be effectively dispersed and held within the THQ frameworks due to sufficiently high binding energies. Most TM-THQ frameworks exhibited favourable selectivity towards CO2 reduction, except for Tc and Ru, which experienced competition from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and required solution environments with pH values greater than 5.716 and 8.819, respectively, to exhibit CO2RR selectivity. Notably, the primary product of Y, Ag, and Cd was HCOOH; Mo produced HCHO; Pd yielded CO; and Zr, Nb, Tc, Ru, and Rh predominantly generated CH4. Among the studied frameworks, Zr-THQ displayed values of 1.212 V and 1.043 V, corresponding to the highest limiting potential and overpotential, respectively, while other metal&#8211;organic frameworks displayed relatively low ranges of overpotentials from 0.179 V to 0.949 V. Consequently, it is predicted that the TM-THQ framework constructed using a fourth-period transition metal and tetrahydroxyquinone exhibits robust electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 catalytic activity.</description>

      <title>Expert insights into future trajectories: assessing cost reductions and scalability of carbon dioxide removal technologies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2024.1331901</link>
      <description>Meinrad Abegg, Zeynep Clulow, Lucrezia Nava, David Reiner, Frontiers in climate. 6(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398174566

                Introduction To achieve net-zero targets, it is essential to evaluate and model the costs and scalability of emerging carbon dioxide removal technologies like direct air capture with CO2 storage (DACCS) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Yet such efforts are often impeded by varying assessments of the climate impact and potential contributions of these technologies. This study explores the future costs and scalability of DACCS and BECCS to advance net-zero goals. Methods We analyze expert opinions on these technologies&#8217; potential costs and deployment scales for 2030, 2040, and 2050. Data was collected from 34 experts, comprising 21 DACCS and 13 BECCS specialists. They provided 90% confidence interval estimates and &#8216;best estimates&#8217; for future costs and deployment under two International Energy Agency (IEA) policy scenarios&#8212;Stated Policies (STEPS) and Net Zero Emissions by 2050 (NZE). Results We find that BECCS costs start at a lower level but decrease more slowly, whereas DACCS costs decline more steeply from a higher initial cost. However, DACCS estimates varied significantly among experts, showing no convergence over time. Regarding potential scalability, both technologies are associated with substantially higher deployment under the NZE scenario. Yet the combined estimated capacity of DACCS and BECCS by 2050 is only about a quarter of the CO2 removals projected by the IEA for its NZE scenario (1.9 GtCO2). Discussion This study provides valuable insights into the future of DACCS and BECCS technologies in Europe, especially since our experts expect that DACCS and BECCS costs will be even higher (and deployment scales lower) than those predicted by recent IEA tracking, opening future research directions.</description>

      <title>Experimental screening of intermetallic alloys for electrochemical CO2 reduction</title>

                In this study, we experimentally screen a promising class of intermetallic alloys for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 toward hydrocarbon products. Based on previous DFT-based screening papers, combinations of strongly CO-binding metals such as iron, cobalt, and nickel with weakly CO-binding metals such as gallium, aluminium or zinc were selected as potentially promising catalytic materials. Despite the challenging production of these alloys, we report a general two-step synthesis method for intermetallic alloys and discuss the specific synthesis conditions that must be taken into account when synthesising these materials. After their synthesis, we use a recently developed differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) setup to rapidly quantify the CO2 reduction products over a range of potentials. Almost all newly developed intermetallic catalysts are shown to produce methane and ethylene, while the CoSn catalyst showed higher selectivity towards formate production. However, all tested catalysts mostly produced hydrogen and only reduce CO2 to a small extent, despite the favourable computational screening results. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy and outline a more holistic approach for linking future DFT studies with experiments.</description>

      <title>Scenario Analysis of CO2 Reduction Potentials from a Carbon Neutral Perspective</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16104274</link>
      <description>Wensheng Wang, Yuting Jia, Sustainability. 16(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398138737

                As a major emitter of CO2, China needs to take responsibility for slowing down global warming. In this paper, the potential carbon emission intensity of provinces is firstly calculated using the non-radial directional distance function under the group- and meta-frontier techniques, and then six scenarios based on two factors (economic development and carbon intensity) are set up to estimate the emission reduction potential of China and each province. Considering the goal of carbon neutrality, the calculation of CO2 emission reduction potential quantifies the amount of emissions that can be reduced and the amount of emissions that should be balanced. Additionally, the degree of difficulty in achieving abatement potential is also calculated. The findings are as follows: First, assuming that the economic growth rate is reduced to 4.4% (achieving the second &#8220;100-year goal&#8221;) and each province adopts the most advanced low-carbon technologies, China could reduce carbon emissions by 5970.56 Mt compared to 2019 levels. To achieve net-zero emissions, the remaining 3824.2 Mt of carbon emissions should be removed by carbon reduction technologies. Second, the effect of slowing down economic growth and decreasing carbon intensity varies greatly among provinces. Hebei and Shandong should be prioritized as they have the greatest potential for emission reductions under both scenarios. Third, it is more difficult for Beijing, Shanghai, Hubei, Hunan, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Chongqing, and Sichuan to achieve the abatement potential and they require more effort to reduce the same amount of carbon emissions compared to other provinces. The study provides a reference for achieving carbon neutrality and helps provinces to develop differentiated emission reduction strategies.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insight into Electrocatalytic Co2 Reduction to Formate by the Iron(I) Porphyrin Complex</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4830504</link>
      <description>Yaqing Wang, Wenzhen Lai, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396981813

                Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into value-added chemicals has been considered as a promising pathway to alleviate the energy crisis and global warming. Iron porphyrins have been extensively studied for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and are well documented to promote CO2-to-CO conversion. However, the mechanism of CO2-to-HCOO- conversion by Fe porphyrin remains unclear. Here, by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigated the detailed mechanism of a novel Fe porphyrin catalyst for CO2 reduction to HCOO- in its Fe(I) state. Our results demonstrated that the reduction of CO2 to HCOO- proceeds through the C-protonation of an FeII-OCO&#183;- complex rather than through the hydrolysis of an FeIII-COOH complex or CO2 insertion in an Fe-H bond. Moreover, the FeIII-COOH complex is not a stable intermediate. The protonation of its hydroxyl group with concomitant C-OH bond cleavage to produce CO is thermodynamically and kinetically unfeasible. Instead, the FeIII-COOH complex can undergo a coordination switch followed by a conformational change to form the active FeII-OCO&#183;- complex for production of HCOO-. Moreover, the single-electron reduction of FeIII-COOH gives FeII-COOH, which leads to formation of CO rather than HCOO-. The insights gained from this work may be useful for designing the electrocatalysts for selective CO2 reduction to formate.</description>

      <title>Marginal abatement cost curves for CO2 emission reduction from shipping to 2050</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.martra.2024.100112</link>
      <description>Tore Longva, Magnus S. Eide, &#216;yvind Endresen, &#216;yvind Sekkes&#230;ter, Henrik Helgesen, Nikolai Hydle Rivedal, Maritime transport research. 6(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398155118

                The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has stated an ambition to achieve net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 and new regulations are under development to achieve this. To inform decisions on GHG regulations, this study has modeled the CO2 emission abatement potentials and costs towards 2050 for all ships above 400 gross tons. We explore CO2 reduction pathways based on marginal abatement cost curves (MACC) for 2030, 2040 and 2050. MACC is an important tool to assess the potential impact of regulations and can inform current policy debates as well as ship owners that need to develop their decarbonization strategies. Compared to previous work, we provide global MACCs taking into account the latest technologies and cost development, including alternative fuels. The updated MACC is based on more than 50 state-of-the-art abatement measures, 10 fuel systems and 8 fuels. The results indicate that the revised IMO GHG strategy ambition of 20&#8211;30 % GHG emission reduction in 2030, relative to 2008, can be reached at a marginal cost of 50&#8211;100 USD/tCO2; 70&#8211;80 % emission reduction in 2040 can be achieved at 230&#8211;240 USD/tCO2 and net-zero emissions in 2050 at a marginal cost of 300 USD/tCO2. The two inputs which have the highest impact on the results are the future cost of carbon-neutral fuels and growth in seaborne trade.</description>

      <title>Building of rich (111) grain boundary in copper for syngas in electrochemical CO2 reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.124212</link>
      <description>Xiao Bai, Jingmin Ge, Heying Yang, Hua Tian, Xueqi Liu, Shiying Li, Zhikun Peng, Yaxi Li, Jiahao Wang, Hongpo Liu, Qun Xu, Applied catalysis. B, Environmental. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4397048659

                Building of grain boundary (GB) in Cu-based catalysts has been demonstrated to be an efficient strategy to control the product selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). However, the fabrication and modulation of GBs in Cu are still challenging. In this study, a series of bare Cu catalysts with controllable density of Cu(111) GBs were investigated systematically for eCO2RR. These catalysts exhibit superior eCO2RR performance for syngas production with a high FE of ~80% and tunable H2/CO ratio of 0.46&#8722;2.78. Three-dimensional wormlike Cu with abundant (111) GBs displays a stable H2/CO ratio of ~0.5 over a wide potential range from &#8722;0.9 to &#8722;1.2 V (vs. RHE). In situ Raman and ATR-SEIRAS spectroscopy combined with DFT calculations reveal that Cu(111) GBs enhance the adsorption of CO2, lower the energy barriers of CO2 to &#8270;COOH and &#8270;CO, further highlighting the potential to control syngas production with desirable proportion over Cu-based catalysts.</description>

                Hydrogen (H2), a relatively underexplored reductant in ferromanganese (FeMn) production, offers an attractive avenue for mitigating gaseous carbon (C) emissions. The reduction behaviour of South African Nchwaning manganese (Mn) ore using gaseous CO/CO2, H2/H2O, and H2 atmospheres was investigated experimentally in the temperature variation of 700, 800, and 900 &#176;C. The effect of different gas compositions and temperatures was studied using a vertical thermogravimetric (TG) tube furnace. During pre-reduction, two parallel reactions occurred, namely the reduction of higher Mn- and iron (Fe) -oxides, and the decomposition of carbonates. After each test, decrepitation, chemical composition, phase transformation, and porosity were characterised. Using the rate of mass loss, a kinetic model was obtained to predict kinetic constants. The oxidation state of the higher Mn- and Fe-oxides was lowered during CO/CO2 and H2/H2O pre-reduction. Only during pure H2 pre-reduction was Fe2+ reduced to its metallic state, Fe0. The majority of carbonates decomposed in the presence of the CO/CO2 atmosphere at 900 &#176;C, whereas in the presence of H2 in the reducing atmosphere carbonates decomposed at a higher rate and at lower temperatures. Additionally, the extent and rate of mass loss were expedited by increasing the temperature, employing H2-containing atmospheres, and lowering the oxygen partial pressure (pO2) of the H2-containing atmospheres. No significant trends were observed in ore decrepitation and porosity across various atmospheres and temperatures, except for decrepitation in the water vapour-containing atmosphere. The utilisation of a pure H2 atmosphere has a significant ability for pre-reducing manganese ores with carbonate content by expediting carbonate decomposition and promoting Fe-oxide metallisation, thereby enhancing the efficiency of ore treatment in metallurgical applications.</description>

                How to achieve CO2 electroreduction in high efficiency is a current challenge with the mechanism not well understood yet. The metal&#8208;organic cages with multiple metal sites, tunable active centers, and well&#8208;defined microenvironments may provide a promising catalyst model. Here, we report self&#8208;assembly of Ag4L4 type cuboctahedral cages from coordination dynamic Ag+ ion and triangular imidazolyl ligand 1,3,5&#8208;tris(1&#8208;benzylbenzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzene (Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;X, X= NO3, ClO4, BF4) via anion template effect. Notably, Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;NO3 achieves the highest CO faradaic efficiency in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes of 86.1%(acidic), 94.1%(neutral) and 95.3% (alkaline), much higher than those of Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;ClO4 and Ag&#8208;MOC&#8208;BF4 with just different counter anions. In situ attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy observes formation of vital intermediate *COOH for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The density functional theory calculations suggest that the adsorption of CO2 on unsaturated Ag&#8208;site is stabilized by C&#8208;H&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;O hydrogen&#8208;bonding of CO2 in a microenvironment surrounded by three benzimidazole rings, and the activation of CO2 is dependent on the coordination dynamics of Ag&#8208;centers modulated by the hosted anions through Ag&#8901;&#8901;&#8901;X interactions. This work offers a supramolecular electrocatalytic strategy based on Ag&#8208;coordination geometry and host&#8208;guest interaction regulation of MOCs as high&#8208;efficient electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction to CO which is a key intermediate in chemical industry process.</description>

      <title>Current advances on low dimensional nanohybrids electrocatalysts toward scale-up electrochemical CO2 reduction: A review</title>

      <description>A. Arifutzzaman, Mohamed Kheireddine Aroua, Munawar Khalil, Journal of CO2 utilization. 83(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398147973

                Due to the industrial revolution the emission of CO2 in the air reached to a noticeable degree (&#8764; 419.51 ppm) and continuous increase leading to effects effect adversely in the global climate. The utilization of captured CO2 through its electrochemical reduction into valuable fuels or chemicals has emerged as a promising technology to address climate change. Thus, among the various approaches electrochemical CO2 reduction is being progressively implemented for the conversion of CO2 into valuable fuels or chemicals. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art of such processes is lacking with respect to performance targets for scaling-up these technologies to industrial levels such as high current density (&gt;200 mA/cm2) as well as stability for &#8764;30000 hours. Unluckily, in most of reported research these criteria found much lower. Distinctive properties of the electrocatalyst materials determine the selective, effective, and stable electrocatalysts of CO2 reduction to industrial scale. The gap between the reported and targeted performance stems from the available electrocatalyst materials that dictate the selectivity, efficiency, and stability of the electrochemical reduction of CO2. In this review, we summarize recent progress made on the modification of low dimensional (LD) nanomaterials and their nanohybrids for the electrochemical reduction of CO2. Particular focus is placed on highlighting common challenges faced by these electrocatalysts, spanning recent advances on modified LD nanomaterials of CNTs, Graphene and MXenes. We further highlight areas that require additional attention in order for such catalyst materials to meet the required targets to enable the scale-up of CO2 electroreduction to the industrial scale.</description>

      <title>Crystalline CdS/amorphous Cd(OH)2 Composite for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to CO in a Wide Potential Window</title>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising method for converting atmospheric CO2 into valuable low&#8208;carbon chemicals. In this study, a crystalline cadmium sulfide/amorphous cadmium hydroxide composite was successfully deposited on the carbon paper substrate surface by in&#8208;situ chemical bath deposition (named as c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrodes) for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce CO. The c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode exhibited high CO Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;90%) under a wide potential window of 1.0 V, with the highest value reaching ~100% at the applied potential ranging from &#8722;2.16 V to &#8722;2.46 V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), superior to the crystalline counterpart c&#8208;CdS/CP and c&#8208;CdS/c&#8208;Cd(OH)2@CP electrodes. Meanwhile, the CO partial current density reached up to 154.7 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.76 V vs. Fc/Fc+ on the c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode. The excellent performance of this electrode was mainly ascribed to its special three&#8208;dimensional structure and the introduction of a&#8208;Cd(OH)2. These structures could provide more active sites, accelerate the charge transfer, and enhance adsorption of *COOH intermediates, thereby improving the CO selectivity. Moreover, the electrolytes consisting of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and acetonitrile also enhanced the reaction kinetics of electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO.</description>

                The rational design of copper (Cu)-based catalysts with different oxidation states is essential to achieve highly selective and efficient CO2 electroreduction. However, the effect of different oxide states of Cu-based catalysts has rarely been studied. Herein, the reaction mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation into CO on Cu-based catalysts with different oxidation states, such as Cu(1 1 1), Cu2O(1 1 1) and CuO(1 1 1), was studied using the density functional theory. The most favored pathway for CO production and the rate-controlling step on the three catalyst models were determined. The results show that, Cu2O (1 1 1) shows the best catalytic activity among the three catalysts due to the lowest activation barrier. The electronic structure analysis shows that Cu2O has the proper electronic structure to activate CO2 which is further reduced to CO. This work provides an important insight on the effect of oxidation state of Cu-based catalysts on the reduction of CO2 to CO.</description>

      <title>Theoretical performance optimization of enzymatic electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate: Voltage, concentration, temperature, pressure, and flow rate</title>

      <description>Daniel Moreno, Journal of CO2 utilization. 83(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398185242

                Formic acid (FA) is a notable fuel product due to its atom economy, low activation energy, and applications in flow cells and hydrogen storage. While metal catalysts are typically used, selectivity remains a challenge. Here, an enzymatic catalyst is employed to selectively convert CO2 to FA as formate. This study documents the development of a computational model to examine the conversion of CO2 to formate under a wide range of conditions. The model examines the electrochemical reduction of a charge carrier, ethyl viologen (EV), and its subsequent use in an enzymatic catalyst to convert CO2 and protons in solution to formate. The model was first developed for a small-scale batch reactor, then later expanded to a dual-cell flow system, where the reduction of EV and production of formate are kept in separated cells, and flow rate is introduced as an additional variable parameter. While no studies have directly used all parameters addressed in the computations presented here, many of the conditions selected align with what has previously been used in experiments, and similar production rates and efficiencies are obtained. The most challenging parameters to study were charge carrier concentration and applied voltage, which showed optimal ranges in the cases studied for the batch and flow cell. While the study gives guidance toward which conditions would be favored experimentally to increase production rate and efficiency experimental studies should nonetheless be run at suggested optimal conditions to better adapt parameters made in both models.</description>

                Membrane reactor processes can be used to overcome the constraints of the chemical rate equilibrium of methanol (MeOH) synthesis products. In this thermodynamics-limited work, three different selective sulfonated poly(ether ether ketones) (SPEEK) membranes were applied in an engineered unit operation with a commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 surface catalyst for several CO2/CO-involving chemistries. A detailed mathematical model with micro-kinetics was developed, optimised and utilised to assess the vessel with barrier by using CERRES (Chemical Reaction and Reactor Engineering Simulations). Scaled separation tests were described by the integrated reference values of permeance. The permeability for all compound molecules (H2, H2O, CO, CO2, MeOH&#8230;) was determined by adjusting parameters to account for the experimental gas composition on the permeate, interface and retention segment side after reduction. The specific kinetic characteristics of the mechanism of elementary step reactions were analysed in fixed bed design. A comparison of the estimated data prediction for the packed system with related definite numbers showed excellent statistical agreement. Similarly, a very good reliability was obtained between the results for 3 SPEEK membrane cases. Thus, the defined particular evaluations of derived theoretical expressions were benchmarked accurately. Although (validated) performance, i.e. the yield of MeOH, was overestimated, discrepancy was not so large so as to simulate behaviour verily. The (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (polyamide) over a SPEEK layer performed best for intensification. Herein, the pressurised (&gt;50 bar) CO2 hydrogenation pathway was not only shifted by in situ removal as a proof of concept, but also modelled intrinsically, considering transport phenomena resistances, adsorption and desorption as well. The storage of hydrogen can benefit from MeOH production reengineering.</description>

                The chapter provides significant and insightful methodological developments and strategies in the field of applied nanotechnology in particular applications in catalysis, pollution and energy. Owing to detrimental climate change and depletion of fossil fuels, we explore novel nanomaterial i.e., 'smart' metal-metal oxides and palladium-based electrocatalysts to achieve the requirements of sustainable and renewable resources. In the last decade, researchers have been engaged in the development of new and fundamental chemistries that will transform the field of nanotechnology and humans. In this view, the concept of green chemistry was coined in the early 1990s and was regarded as the engine in the development of new green nanomaterial. This transition is driving the investigation of green chemistry to mitigate environmental problems, replace traditional methods with novel designs and ultimately replace unsustainable chemistries. With this consideration, the preparation of catalytically active bio-inspired Ni/MgO and Cu/Cu2O/CuO/ZnO and Pd-based Pd-NiO/C, Pd/C and Pd-Cu/Cu2O/CuO/Zn using plant biological entities and waste materials as an eco-friendly, green route are explored. This chapter highlights the mechanism of interaction whilst exploring in-depth the leading edge of green-prepared nanomaterials in storage and energy conversion. This comprises studying the electrochemical phenomena of nanostructured materials, electrocatalysis, activity, stability, vital processes of polarisation resistance and diffusion-controlled systems at the nanostructured electrode surface through catalysis. A short overview and use of nanostructured material in energy spheres such as carbon dioxide electrochemical systems to produce energy fuels are also covered.</description>

      <title>Water-induced Selectivity Switching and Steric Control of Activity in Photochemical CO2 Reduction Catalyzed by RhCp*(bpy) Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-t3ltd</link>

                Photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) was investigated in either organic or aqueous/organic media by employing three newly synthesized water-soluble Rh(Cp*)(n,n&#8217;-dihydroxy-2,2&#8217;-bipyridine) (n = 4, 5, or 6) in the presence of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH) and triethanolamine (TEOA). Through studying the electron-donating effects of two hydroxyl groups introduced to the bipyridyl ligand, we found that the hydroxyl group positions of the catalyst greatly affect both the catalytic efficiency and selectivity in CO2 reduction. More importantly, the HCOOH selectivity shows a dramatic increase from 14% to 83% upon switching the solvent media from pure organic to aqueous/organic mixture, where the H2 selectivity shows a reverse phenomenon. The enhanced HCOOH selectivity and the drastic decrease in the apparent H2 yield are well rationalized by the fact that the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation by the evolved H2 simultaneously proceeds as a dark catalytic reaction, which was also separately investigated under the dark conditions. Our DFT studies unveil that the exceptionally large structural strain given by the steric contacts between the 6,6&#8217;-dihydroxyl groups and the Cp* moiety plays a significant role in bringing about an outstanding catalytic performance of the 6,6&#8217;-subsituted derivative. The intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations on the hydride transfer steps leading to generate formate together the heterolytic H2 cleavage steps leading to afford the key hydridorhodium intermediates afford the results useful to interpret the observed phenomena. This study represents the first report on the water-induced high selectivity in CO2-to-HCOOH conversion, shedding a new light on the strategy to control the efficiency and selectivity in CO2 reduction.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Origin of Graphene Anchored Single Palladium Atom for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Syngas with Tunable CO/H2 Ratios</title>

                Pd based catalysts are rare metal&#8208;based catalyst to yield tunable CO/H2 ratios for Fischer&#8208;Tropsch synthesis. How to achieve the co&#8208;production of CO and H2 with as little Pd as possible is extremely meaningful for Cn industry. Recent experiment revealed single Pd atom anchored on graphene exhibits high activity for CO2 electroreduction to syngas, yet the origin of activity and controllable CO/H2 ratios, especially the exact Pd coordination structure, remains elusive. Here we employ grand&#8208;canonical density functional theory to show that Pd&#8208;N1, rather than the commonly accepted Pd&#8208;N4, serves as the active center, and the charge&#8208;carrying capability is an effective descriptor. The site with more Pd&#8209;C coordination can better submerge in graphene's delocalized &#960; electrons for higher charge&#8208;carrying capacity to carry excess charges that occupy Pd 4dz2 orbital and promote electron injection. Importantly, the tunable CO/H2 ratio can be explained with difference in charge&#8208;carrying capability of transition state for *COOH and *H2 formation. This work solves the puzzle of coordinating structure of Pd active site and demonstrates the important role of charge&#8208;carrying capability in electrochemical process, which shall provide a reference for further exploration of efficient electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Financial Efficiency and Renewable Energy Consumption on CO2 Emissions Reduction in GCC Economies: A Panel Data Quantile Regression Approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202405.0997.v1</link>

                As prominent oil producers, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have played a significant role in the global energy market. However, as the world's attention increasingly shifts towards environmental sustainability, understanding the implications of the GCC's economic activities on CO2 emissions becomes indispensable. This research paper investigates the relationship between specific economic indicators and their impact on CO2 emissions in the GCC from 2001 to 2021. The study employs quantile regression, a powerful statistical method that estimates the conditional quantiles of a response variable given a set of predictor variables. The findings reveal several important insights: Financial institution efficiency is significant and negative at a 1% level at the lower (10th) -83537.3 and the higher quantile (90th) -549002.3. The relationship between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions varies across quantiles, highlighting the complexity of the growth-environment nexus. Total patents exhibit a positive and significant relationship with emissions, underscoring the importance of directing innovation towards environmentally sustainable solutions. Renewable energy consumption displays a nuanced relationship with CO2 emissions, with a stronger negative impact observed at higher consumption levels. This underscores the potential of renewable energy to mitigate emissions when integrated at scale. The study's outcomes hold crucial policy implications for the GCC countries as they seek to align economic growth with environmental sustainability. The findings emphasize the importance of fostering financial institution efficiency, promoting green innovation, and expanding renewable energy sources to reduce emissions</description>

      <title>Charting a path to low-carbon leadership: unlocking up to 90% emissions reductions in greenfield LNG</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23278</link>

                The liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry stands at the cusp of a transformation driven by the climate imperative. Focussing on the Middle Arm Industrial Precinct, this paper shows how carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are being reduced in a proposed world-class LNG project by assessing, screening and selecting known technologies using a Marginal Abatement philosophy linked to key emissions drivers. (1) We propose a new breed of electrified LNG facilities that could deliver an up to 90% reduction in CO2 intensity. (2) We show that through developing strategic partnerships in upstream renewable power, hydrogen supply, and enabled downstream carbon capture and storage (CCS), the significant low carbon energy requirements of an LNG facility can be delivered. (3) We discuss a Marginal Abatement assessment strategy which ensures a pathway to viable lowest cost opportunities selected in an &#8216;Avoid &amp; Mitigate&#8217; first approach. This proposed strategy ensures that CO2 emission reduction opportunities are assessed and selected consistently to determine both a lifecycle cost ($) and volume (tons CO2e) of emission reduction. These innovative strategies collectively articulate a roadmap for a low carbon future for LNG and other heavy industrial industries, underlining Australia&#8217;s potential to become a leading provider of low-carbon natural resources.</description>

      <title>Can Australia become APAC&#8217;s CCS hub of choice?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23228</link>
      <description>Stephanie Chiang, No host. 64(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396975322

                Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is critical in Australia for future production of lower-carbon natural gas for domestic use and international export. There may also be targeted applications in other sectors, such as electricity, industrial heat generation and manufacturing, but only a small portion of the country&#8217;s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are likely to be addressed with carbon capture. That leaves significant CO2 storage potential untapped. Wood Mackenzie&#8217;s analysis suggests that Australia&#8217;s CCS opportunity lies less in the reduction of domestic emissions, and more in enabling other countries&#8217; net zero ambitions. This involves building hubs to transport and store CO2 at scale, using Australia&#8217;s vast geological resources. Such hubs are major capital projects and typically require billions of dollars of investment. However, supporting CO2 storage hubs with public funding may feel like a bitter policy pill to swallow, if there is not a large Australian emissions reduction number on the other side of it. So, why should Australia put its money towards this, and fast? In this paper, we will size the economic opportunity, benchmark Australia&#8217;s competitiveness with other aspiring hubs in the region and assess the amount of investment and policies required to get there.</description>

      <title>Effect of Calcium Peroxide on the Food Waste Composting Process</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.59324/ejtas.2024.2(3).04</link>
      <description>Wafula Gerald Nalume, S. A. Seif, Lena Omina Obel, European journal of theoretical and applied sciences. 2(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396978636

                Aerobic composting acknowledged as a crucial technology in the management of food waste, offers a potential approach to sustainable production practices by producing top-notch organic fertilizers and soil conditioners. Nevertheless, the natural process of composting contributes to environmental pollution by releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. This study examines the effectiveness of adding calcium peroxide to the composting process to improve the availability of oxygen, reduce CO2 emissions, and enhance the quality of the final products. The study involved conducting experimental trials using different doses of calcium peroxide (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) to evaluate its effect on reducing CO2 levels. The results demonstrate a substantial decrease in CO2 emissions, where concentrations of 20% lead to a reduction of 36.82%while in 5%, 10%, and 15% the reductions were 19.15%,26.36%, and 36.32%, respectively. In addition, the inclusion of calcium peroxide raises the pH of food waste samples and introduces calcium ions (Ca2+) into the end product. The results emphasize the significance of dealing with carbon emissions in composting procedures to adhere to Sustainable Development Goals 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 13 (climate action), thus progressing towards more sustainable waste management techniques.</description>

      <title>Spiral-Pipe Gas Anaerobic Digester</title>

                The reduction of carbon dioxide to methane using hydrogen is an important process in biogas production. However, designing gas anaerobic digesters (GADs) based on this reaction presents several challenges. In this study, we developed an innovative spiral-pipe gas anaerobic digester (SGAD) to increase the displacement distance between the bubbles, thus prolonging the gas retention time and facilitating the reduction of CO2 to CH4 via H2. The process was successfully demonstrated by using a CO2/H2 ratio of 1:3 and a gas-feeding rate of 3.9 L Lr&#8211;1 d&#8211;1. During the experiment, more than 98% of the CO2 and 96% of the H2 were consumed, resulting in biogas containing ca. 86&#8211;96% CH4. Additionally, we applied our proposed evaluation methodology for assessing GAD performance to evaluate the performance of the SGAD. This methodology serves as a reference for evaluating and designing GAD systems. The innovative design of the SGAD and the corresponding evaluation methodology offer new insights into the design of reactors.</description>

                This work presents an experimental proof-of-concept study for a three-stage pyrolysis-catalytic dry reforming process for recovering valuable chemicals from waste plastics. It is demonstrated that depending upon the catalysts, process parameters and reactor configuration, plastic waste and carbon dioxide can be converted into a diverse array of valuable chemicals which can be used as secondary feedstocks in the chemical or petrochemical industry, thus decreasing dependency on fossil resources and contributing to waste reduction. For this work, waste polypropylene was thermally pyrolyzed and the emerging vapors were passed over HZSM-5 catalyst to obtain BTEX-rich pyrolysis oil and pyrolysis gases containing mainly C1 to C4 hydrocarbons. The gaseous products were separated, mixed with CO2 and passed over Ni-silicalite-1 catalyst to obtain syngas, thus upgrading the pyrolysis gases and contributing to CO2 reduction. This study may provide new insights towards the development of processes for the chemical recycling of waste plastics and CO2.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of hydrogen production pathways for emethanol synthesis to decarbonise industry</title>

                Methane pyrolysis and water electrolysis offer alternative hydrogen pathways to methane reforming that utilise renewable power and avoid generating carbon dioxide (CO2). On a scope 1 and 2 basis, both technologies have the potential to generate carbon neutral emethanol fuel when combined with biogenic CO2. However, pyrolysis requires significantly less energy and has a lower capital expenditure (CAPEX). Being a more nascent technology, it also has upside potential for cost reductions and valorisation of the solid carbon by-product can yield lower hydrogen costs than the incumbent technology, however, limited demand from existing markets is a potential constraint. Industry decarbonisation is constrained due to a lack of available renewables and hydrogen infrastructure. Pyrolysis offers a potential cost-effective use of the available renewable assets in the early stages while the carbon by-product is not a constraint and until sufficient renewable infrastructure is in place to support water electrolysis at a cost-effective scale.</description>

                Carbon dioxide (CO2), emissions, greenhouse gases, and emission units are pivotal concepts shaping the energyclimate policies of many countries, collectively linked by the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS). Understanding this system, i.e. the taxation of CO2 emitters, becomes extremely important from the perspective of the profitability of existing fossil fuel thermal power plants. Montenegro, as the first non-EU country in the region, has implemented an emissions trading system similar to the EU ETS. If other countries do not adopt a specific form of taxing emissions from industries, they will face a cross-border CO2 tax that the EU plans to introduce from 2026. This study focuses on analyzing the challenges arising from carbon dioxide emissions from the only thermal power plant in Montenegro, particularly considering the obligations during the accession to the European Union (EU). There is a substantial need for emission reductions in line with strict EU standards while simultaneously maintaining the sustainability of the energy sector. The paper addresses challenges related to the payment of carbon dioxide emissions, exploring necessary economic mechanisms for calculation and management. The legal regulations governing this area were also analyzed. In fulfilling the obligation arising from the Law on Protection from Adverse Effects of Climate Change, an Emission Monitoring Plan for greenhouse gases was developed for the Pljevlja Thermal Power Plant. By preparing this document, the requirement for obtaining the Greenhouse Gas Emission Permit for the Pljevlja Thermal Power Plant for a period of 10 years was fulfilled. The permit defines the reporting frequency, including the submission of a Verified Greenhouse Gas Emission Report to the Environmental Protection and Nature Agency by March 1st of the current year for the previous year.</description>

      <title>Development of long-distance and large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) value chain using liquefied CO2 ship transportation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23085</link>
      <description>Daein Cha, No host. 64(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396974846

                Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is central to clean energy transition. Globally, potential aggregated carbon dioxide (CO2) storage resource capacity is ~13,000 billion tonnes. Assuming global greenhouse gas emissions of 51 billion tonnes per annum, CO2 storage capacity equates to 250 years of global emissions reduction. While there is significant momentum to deploy CCS technology for meeting Paris Agreement targets, the key challenge for offering CCS to all industrial sectors is that many major CO2 emission sources are located hundreds of kilometres away from geological storage sites. To address this key challenge, there is a need to develop a long-distance and large-scale CCS value chain that utilises liquefied CO2 (LCO2) ship transportation. This paper discusses key technical, commercial, and regulatory considerations that must be addressed in parallel for developing such a CCS value chain. More specifically, it will cover the following: (1) technical &#8211; CO2 liquefaction condition, CO2 supply specification and LCO2 ship parcel size; (2) commercial &#8211; business model (ownership of CO2 retained by emitters or transferred to CCS project proponent), CO2 supply or CCS facility lease terms and conditions; and (3) regulatory &#8211; domestic versus transboundary projects and associated needs for policy and legislative underpinning.</description>

                The exploitation of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a sustainable, plentiful, and harmless C1 source for the catalytic synthesis of enantioenriched carboxylic acids has long been acknowledged as a pivotal task in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present a current-driven nickel-catalyzed reductive carboxylation reaction with CO2 fixation, facilitating the formation of C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) bonds by circumventing the handling of moisture-sensitive organometallic reagents. This electroreductive protocol serves as a practical platform, paving the way for the synthesis of enantioenriched propargylic carboxylic acids (up to 98% enantiomeric excess) from racemic propargylic carbonates and CO2. The efficacy of this transformation is exemplified by its successful utilization in the asymmetric total synthesis of (S)-arundic acid, (R)-PIA, (S)-chizhine D, (S)-cochlearin G, and (S,S)-alexidine, thereby underscoring the potential of asymmetric electrosynthesis to achieve complex molecular architectures sustainably.</description>

                The urban carbon footprint (UCF) is an important tool for assessing an organization&#8217;s ecological impacts and in guiding sustainability efforts. This calculation is usually measured in tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq). Calculations provide important data to determine strategies to reduce the carbon footprint and establish sustainability targets. Various standards and protocols guide UCF calculation, and many organizations aim to make these data transparent to their stakeholders and the public. This study aims to calculate the UCF of Sar&#305;&#231;am Municipality (SM) in the Adana Province of T&#252;rkiye. This study includes the greenhouse gas emission inventories resulting from all activities of the SM main service building, guest house, construction site service building, Cultural Center service building, and additional service buildings between 1 January 2022 and 31 December 2022. The calculations include generator fuel consumption, electricity consumption, the refrigerant gas leaks and refills resulting from these activities, the fuel consumed in vehicles owned by the company or whose fuel consumption is under company control, emissions originating from personal travel, emissions originating from customers and visitors, emissions originating from business travel, purchases, etc. Emissions from products purchased and emissions from waste transportation are included. The findings show that, in 2022, the total UCF of SM was equal to 10,862.46 tons of CO2-eq. The Paris Agreement aims to reduce the per capita emissions to approximately two tons of CO2-eq by 2030. The carbon footprint per employee within the municipality was calculated at 12.43 tons of CO2-eq, as derived from the analyzed data. The results reveal the importance of implementing sustainable practices and strategies within SM, such as energy efficiency measures, waste reduction, and the adoption of renewable energy sources, to mitigate its carbon footprint. This study plans to provide a basis for SM&#8217;s reduction efforts by keeping greenhouse gas emissions under control.</description>

      <title>Influence of Carbon Dioxide on Micro-cracking in Calcite: An Atomistic Scale Investigation</title>

                In candidate formations for geological Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite) are ubiquitously presented. The dynamic process of chemically induced alteration on carbonate-rich reservoirs due to the injection of supercritical CO2 holds paramount importance for achieving an economic injectivity and structural integrity of the system. How carbonate rocks undergo deterioration and particularly how microcracks develop in the presence of carbon dioxide remain largely unknown. Here we employ a powerful tool of reactive force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, investigating into the impact of representative CO2 environments on Mode I tensile crack propagation in calcite at micro-scale. Our simulation results demonstrate that (1) both dry and wet CO2 environments favor the tensile crack propagation by lowering the fracture toughness of the pre-existing crack; (2) the wet CO2 environment promotes the growth velocity of the subcritical crack compared to the dry CO2 environment, under the same mechanical loading condition; (3) the interaction between the stressed crack and the CO2-water mixture diffusing into the crack opening leads to a small reduction of the system potential energy at an initial stage of subcritical growth; (4) The crack tip appears to be sharper in both dry CO2 and wet CO2 environments, albeit at a lower stress intensity factor than the vacuum case. The atomistic scale findings provide new insights on the process of subcritical calcite cracking induced by a reactive environment via CO2 injection, prior to the damage-enhanced dissolution phase.</description>

      <title>Study on the Mechanism of Carbon Dioxide Miscible Fracturing Fluid Huff and Puff in Enhanced Oil Recovery</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12051019</link>

                Carbon dioxide (CO2) miscible fracturing huff-and-puff technology now plays a pivotal role in enhancing crude oil recovery rates, particularly in reservoirs with challenging physical properties, strong water sensitivity, high injection pressure, and complex water-injection dynamics. In this study, the oil-increasing mechanism and huff-and-puff effect of CO2 miscible fracturing fluid are investigated through a comprehensive experimental approach. Specifically, experiments on PVT gas injection expansion, minimum miscible pressure, and CO2 miscible fracturing fluid huff and puff are conducted on the G fault block reservoir of the J Oilfield. The experimental findings demonstrate that injecting CO2 into reservoirs leads to an expansion in oil volume, a reduction in viscosity, and an increase in saturation pressure. Crude oil extraction is further enhanced by the addition of solubilizers and viscosity reducers. The use of solubilizers not only increases oil recovery rates but also reduces the minimum miscible pressure required for effective CO2 dispersion. We also found that shut-in times, permeability, and the huff-and-puff method used all have considerable impacts on huff-and-puff recovery rates. This study offers valuable technical insights, supporting the application of CO2 miscible fracturing huff-and-puff technology to enhance oil recovery rates in low-permeability reservoirs.</description>

                The development of synthetic microorganisms that could use one-carbon compounds, such as carbon dioxide, methanol, or formate, has received considerable interest. In this study, we engineered Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to both synthetic methylotrophy and formatotrophy, enabling them to co-utilize methanol or formate with CO2 fixation through a synthetic C1-compound assimilation pathway (MFORG pathway). This pathway consisted of a methanol-formate oxidation module and the reductive glycine pathway. We first assembled the MFORG pathway in P. pastoris using endogenous enzymes, followed by blocking the native methanol assimilation pathway, modularly engineering genes of MFORG pathway, and compartmentalizing the methanol oxidation module. These modifications successfully enabled the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris to utilize both methanol and formate. We then introduced the MFORG pathway from P. pastoris into the model yeast S. cerevisiae, establishing the synthetic methylotrophy and formatotrophy in this organism. The resulting strain could also successfully utilize both methanol and formate with consumption rates of 20 mg/L/h and 36.5 mg/L/h, respectively. The ability of the engineered P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae to co-assimilate CO2 with methanol or formate through the MFORG pathway was also confirmed by 13C-tracer analysis. Finally, production of 5-aminolevulinic acid and lactic acid by co-assimilating methanol and CO2 was demonstrated in the engineered P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae. This work indicates the potential of the MFORG pathway in developing different hosts to use various one-carbon compounds for chemical production.</description>

      <title>Megawatts to methane &#8211; a deep drop in emissions reduction transition for existing regional gas-based ammonia plants</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23066</link>
      <description>Jacob de Boer, No host. 64(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396974925

                Synthetic ammonia production sustains food production for more than half of the world&#8217;s population. Many regional ammonia plants convert all ammonia to ammonium nitrate fertiliser. With these, all carbon in the feed ends up as carbon dioxide (CO2), with around 2 tonnes of CO2 released per tonne of ammonia produced using natural gas. Conveniently, ammonia plants produce a substantial pre-concentrated CO2 stream. Ammonia plants are high-capex, long-life assets that operate for 40+ years. With the energy transition, replacing such assets is very high cost and will dramatically impact the cost of food production. Further, green energy is highly variable, leading to the need for additional supply side assets to stabilise energy supply. This paper outlines a transition approach for a 30% CO2 reduction (also a 43% case) to extend the useful life of these assets while re-using much of the plant, with the ability to turn on/off the green energy with minimal disruption for stable operation. The example plant is based on a typical 750 tpd ammonia gas Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) plant. The approach considers adding and integrating green power and biogas into this plant to reduce net reportable CO2 emissions. Methanation of CO2 has been demonstrated in several projects and is considered key in developing a transition pathway for an existing gas-based plant, extending its operational life and flexibility to operate with varying degrees of variable green energy supply. Further, whilst Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) is used in this case, the approach can be beneficially applied with methanol and other Power-to-X opportunities.</description>

      <title>Emissions reduction in LNG production facilities through emerging post-combustion carbon capture and storage technologies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23150</link>
      <description>David T. Kearns, No host. 64(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396974666

                The liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector relies extensively on gas turbines for on-site power generation and to drive refrigeration compressors. They provide an efficient and reliable energy source for LNG operations in remote locations. With upcoming changes to the Safeguard Mechanism in Australia, there is an increased focus on Scope 1 emissions, so management and targeted reduction are a priority to reduce liabilities. Despite technology advancements, gas turbines remain one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in LNG production facilities. Also, in Australia, many facilities are not grid-connected, meaning that displacement of Scope 1 emissions through renewable electricity sourcing is a challenge. To develop deeper cuts in Scope 1 emissions, one solution is to deploy post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) on existing gas turbines, with the potential to reduce associated emissions by over 90%. Globally, a number of LNG facilities are already deploying CCS to permanently store reservoir CO2 from the LNG processing trains. Several Australian LNG facilities are located in close proximity to potential CO2 storage reservoirs, meaning that a coordinated approach to both reservoir and post-combustion CO2 should be considered when sizing pipelines, shipping systems and storage wells to optimise and leverage the required investment. This paper outlines the technological, economic and policy aspects of integrating both reservoir post-combustion CCS on LNG facilities, including barriers and opportunities for deployment. It will discuss new developments and enablers for CCS to be more widely deployed at LNG production sites.</description>

      <title>Defining the geomechanical operating limits for subsurface CO2 storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23126</link>
      <description>Simon Holford, Mojtaba Rajabi, Scott D. Mildren, Robert G. King, Adam Bailey, No host. 64(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396977325

                Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical component of proposed pathways to limit global warming, though considerable upscaling is required to meet emissions reduction targets. Quantifying and managing the risks of fault reactivation is a leading barrier to scaling global CCS projects from current levels of ~40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide(CO2) per year (to target levels of several gigatonnes of CO2 per year), because CO2 injection into reservoirs can result in increased pore-fluid pressure and temperature changes, which can reduce the strength of rocks and faults and induce brittle failure. This can result in induced seismicity, whilst hydraulic fracturing of seals could provide pathways for CO2 leakage. Consequently, identifying favourable geomechanical conditions (typically determined through data on pre-injection rock stress, mechanical and elastic properties, and pore-fluid pressures) to minimise deformation of reservoirs and seals represents a key challenge in the selection of safe and effective sites for CCS projects. Critically, however, such geomechanical data are typically spatially limited (i.e. restricted to wells) and mainly consist of pre-injection crustal stress orientation measurements, rather than a full 3D description of the stress tensor and related geomechanical properties. This paper reviews some key geomechanical issues and knowledge gaps (particularly those associated with data availability and limitations) that need to be understood to enable successful reservoir and seal management for CCS projects. We also highlight recent advances in multi-scale and dimensional geomechanical modelling approaches that can be used to assess sites for the secure storage of CO2 as well as other gases, including hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Securing the Australian CCS project rollout by improving aspects of the GHG storage legislation: a discussion paper</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23193</link>
      <description>Geoffrey O&#8217;Brien, S G. S Morton, David Bason, No host. 64(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396974849

                The respective Federal petroleum and greenhouse-gas (GHG) storage legislation was examined in detail to understand the interactions between the technical requirements in the legislation, the overarching emissions-policy framework and the existing and likely future technical capabilities of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry. Key elements of the GHG legislation were then stress-tested using CCS project examples to determine applicability. The number of CCS projects required to meet the nation&#8217;s emission reduction targets over the next 5&#8211;25 years is high (probably between 20&#8211;40 projects of 4 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa)), but the existing 8&#8211;10 year approvals timeline provides only a maximum of 2.5 full project cycles to undertake 20&#8211;40 projects, a goal not considered possible without substantial regulatory reform. Opportunities for improvement should focus on facilitating a robust and rapid CCS project rollout and could include the following: changing the legislation to facilitate the accelerated utilisation of depleted petroleum fields to storage facilities, including allowing the progressive expansion of the awarded injection licence (IL); changing the concept of containment to emphasise carbon dioxide (CO2) plume management via assessing risk and potential impacts, not by artificial constraints into GHG permits and licences; including unitisation and combination pathways in the GHG legislation; &#8216;CO2 plume&#8217; is not defined in legislation, even though the spatial location of a plume is central to numerous approvals, such as declaration of storage, demonstrating containment and all measurement, monitoring and verification (MMV) programs; developing a framework to manage future CCS project interactions at a basin scale, as is undertaken in groundwater management onshore.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of abrasive SC-CO2 jet for horizontal well cavity completion in deep coal seams: Insights from a fluid-thermal-structural coupling model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2024.123457</link>
      <description>Jianxiang Chen, Ruiyue Yang, Jiawen Li, Zhongwei Huang, Wenhao He, Xiaozhou Qin, Applied thermal engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398185509

                Deep coal seams hold significant potential for coalbed methane (CBM) development and also offer advantageous formations for CO2 geological storage (CGS). However, deep coal seams in China often face challenges of low permeability and high in-situ stress, rendering conventional reservoir stimulation methods less effective. To overcome these challenges, we proposed an innovative method for horizontal well cavity completion in deep coal seams by using the abrasive supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) jet. The approach utilized the SC-CO2 jet to create multiple cavities in horizontal wells within the coal seams. It is expected to achieve stress relief, enhance permeability, and enable CO2 geological storage simultaneously. In this paper, we developed a fluid-thermal-structural coupling model to investigate the feasibility of abrasive SC-CO2 jet. The influence of pressure drops, jet temperature and jet distance were investigated. The findings indicated that the performance of abrasive SC-CO2 jets exceeded that of abrasive water jets in several key aspects, including jet velocity, impact strength, and abrasive erosion rate. However, the lower density and viscosity of SC-CO2 resulted in a diminished particle-carrying capacity. Compared to the abrasive water jet, a lower sand ratio or lighter density particles are recommended, when applying SC-CO2 in practice. Increasing jet pressure and temperature both contributed to improved rock breaking efficiency, yet through different mechanisms. An increase in jet pressure could provide more energy and enhanced the density and viscosity of SC-CO2, thereby boosting its particle-carrying capacity and improving the impingement effect. In comparison, the high temperature led to a reduction in both density and viscosity of SC-CO2. Although these changes in physical properties could increase jet velocity, it simultaneously diminished particle-carrying capacity, potentially increasing the risk of sand blockages during application. The flow field of swirling jet is accompanied by the high energy dissipation, impeding the formation of large-diameter cavities. In response, we proposed a design wherein swirling and conical nozzles were alternately arranged on the jetting tool. This scheme leveraged the distinct strengths of each nozzle type, aiming to enhance the efficiency of cavity construction using abrasive SC-CO2 jets.</description>

                Biogas is obtained from the breakdown of biomass by microorganisms and bacteria in the absence of oxygen. Biogas is considered a renewable source of energy, similar to solar energy and wind energy. Biogas can be produced from biomass or bio-waste; thus, it is environmentally friendly. Biogas is obtained in a suspended monoxide decomposition process by anaerobic bacteria or in a fermentation process of decomposable materials such as agricultural manure, sewage, municipal waste, green waste (gardens and parks), plant material and agricultural products. Biogas is a renewable natural energy source that leaves effective effects on nature and industries. This gas is produced from the decomposition of organic materials, including animal manure, food waste and sewage. Fertilizers and waste produce biogas through anaerobic digestion (ie without the presence of oxygen). Biogas is a mixture of gases generated by decaying biodegradable material without the presence of oxygen. Its main contents are 50&#8211;70 % of methane (CH4) by volume, 30&#8211;50 % of carbon dioxide (CO2), and traces of other gases, like hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and water vapor (H2O). CO2, H2S, and water vapor content in biogas may affect the performance and life of the energy conversion devices; consequently, their removal before end-use is essential for improving the quality of biogas. This combination is an ideal option for making renewable energy. The most important advantages of biogas (production of energy, reduction of the amount of discarded waste, reduction of pathogens, conversion of waste containing organic matter into high quality fertilizer, protection of vegetation, soil, water, increasing productivity in the field of livestock and agriculture) and It is also one of the disadvantages of biogas (incomplete and small technologies, containing impurities, the effect of temperature on biogas production, unsuitable for urban and dense areas, not affordable). For economical use of biogas, the fermentation process can be carried out under controlled conditions in a relatively simple device called a digestion reservoir. This review summarizes the current state-of-the-art and presents future perspectives related to the anaerobic digestion process for biogas production. Moreover, a historical retrospective of biogas sector from the early years of its development till its recent advancements give an outlook of the opportunities that are opening up for process optimization.</description>

                Abstract The accelerating climate warming requires fast methods to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Here, we converted carbon dioxide into titanium carbide using four magnetrons which were sequentially operated to emit microwave on titanium swarf. Carbon dioxide molecules dissociated in the plasma to react with ionized titanium atoms to form a stable titanium carbide product, using a microwave frequency is 2.3 gigahertz and 800 watts electrical power for each magnetron. Results show a reduction of carbon dioxide concentration from 2000 to 385 ppm within 30 s. Titanium carbide could be further functionalized as a three-dimensional printed gas sensor.</description>

                For over 50 years Gippsland Basin Joint Venture (GBJV) has been producing oil and gas from the Gippsland Basin. Through hard work, challenging the status quo and innovation, the business, the operation and the people have been on a transformational journey. You may have heard about our conventional expansion opportunities, Kipper-Tuna-Turrum development and Longford Gas Conditioning Plant, but have you heard about how GBJV is progressing carbon dioxide (CO2) to sales with BOC and Air Liquide or how the team has reduced flare by 46% since 2018? Have you heard how the team increased Longford&#8217;s capacity by 11% in 2022 to deliver the highest gas production since 2017 to meet market demand. Or about how we are transforming the operation through our Gippsland Asset Streamlining Project, where we will no longer have a Crude Stabilisation Plant or a Gas Plant 1 at Longford? We continue to focus on our reliable gas operation through upcoming projects such as Hastings Generation Project, and Kipper Compression Project while also pursuing meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions such as South East Australia Carbon Capture and Storage Project in the Gippsland Basin. Our transformation to a &#8216;Modern Australian Gas Business&#8217; has not only meant change for our facilities but also change for our people in how we work and the culture we have built. Every day, our teams work to supply essential energy to Australian homes and businesses while also being on a transformational journey to improve the sustainability of our operation and contribute to the energy transition.</description>

      <title>The pressure of coal consumption on China's carbon dioxide emissions: A spatial and temporal perspective</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apr.2024.102188</link>
      <description>Xiaoxuan Kao, Yang Liu, Wensheng Wang, Qianyun Wen, Pan Zhang, Atmospheric pollution research. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398147550

                As the world's largest coal consumer, China is facing the dual challenge of implementing strict coal reduction policies while heavily relying on coal. It is crucial to comprehend the pressures exerted on carbon dioxide emissions from coal consumption as China strives to transition towards a carbon-neutral era. This study defines and classifies the pressure of carbon dioxide emissions resulting from coal consumption, referred to as "carbon-coal pressure", in 30 provinces (including municipalities and autonomous regions) from 1997 to 2019. This classification enriches the study of the pressure on carbon dioxide emissions by specific energy types. By calculating the centre of gravity of the carbon-coal pressure and its evolution trends, the spatial pattern of the carbon-coal pressure and the evolution characteristics of the centre of gravity of the pressure are revealed. The results demonstrate that, despite the continuous growth in total coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in China, the carbon-coal pressure index exhibits a decreasing trend in certain regions, with significant inter-regional differences. Most provinces fall into the high-pressure and higher-pressure categories. The number of high-pressure provinces has decreased by 33% from 18 to 8, while the number of low-pressure provinces has risen from 0 to 1, and both higher and medium pressure types have increased. The overall stress index decreases from 0.79 to 0.7. The pressure centre displays a similar spatial trend to the overall changes in coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions centre, albeit with a smaller magnitude of change. Beijing stands out as the only province with low pressure.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive overview of determinations and analyses on the thermophysical properties of hydrates and hydrate-bearing sediments</title>

      <description>Xiangming Xiao, Qian Hu, Mingyang Li, Yunfeng Wang, Qing Chen, Gas science and engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398185018

                Gas hydrates offer novel perspectives to achieve the reduction in substantial emissions of carbon dioxide and the recovery of abundant methane. This is attributed to the potential of carbon dioxide hydrates to efficiently sequestrate carbon dioxide in the form of solid phase, while abundant methane could be recovered through the dissociation of natural gas hydrates in hydrate deposits. Considering that the formation and dissociation characteristics of hydrates are in closely related with their performances of heat transfer and thermodynamic conditions, the efficiencies of sequestration and recovery can be influenced by the thermophysical properties of hydrates. Besides, carbon dioxide hydrates being stably formed in seabed sediments is a potential sequestration scheme of carbon dioxide, and abundant natural gas hydrates are found to be deposited in marine sediments. Therefore, this work is focused on hydrates and hydrate-bearing sediments, and comprehensively reviews their significant thermophysical properties including phase equilibrium data, dissociation enthalpy, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity and specific heat capacity. Specifically, the principles of determination methods are clearly clarified, and strengths and weaknesses of various methods in accuracy and convenience are compared; Specific values of thermophysical properties are presented, and the variation characteristics of values are also analyzed based on different influencing factors. Additionally, the associated prospects are proposed.</description>

      <title>Biochar Enriched Concrete for Carbon Sequestration</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.22214/ijraset.2024.62307</link>
      <description>Vikram R. Tirpude, International journal for research in applied science and engineering technology. 12(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398155283

                Abstract: In upcoming years , a lot of construction is going to happen leading to more cement consumption and more GHG&#8217;s emissions by default as an embodied carbon. Reduction of cement consumption is possible by partially repacing it with biochar which is a by-product of pyrolysis of biomass or adding it as an additive in cement mortar and concrete for carbon sequestration. Biochar is effective in carbon sequestration activity and results in high water and carbon dioxide holding capacity. Increase in biochar lead to increase in carbon sequestration . As pozzolanic activity lead to strength gaining characteristics and durability of concrete, this study focusses on investigating pozzolanic activity of biochar. Biomass considered in this study were walnut shells and pretreatment was done with 0.1 N HCl and and pozzolanic activity is checked by chapelle test by observing Ca(OH)2 fixation during the titration. It was observed that increase in temperature or Normality of HCl in pretreatment does not enhance pozzolanic activity of biochar . Hence pretreatment with 0.1 N HCl at room temperature for an hour is sufficient to enhance the pozzolanic activity of biochar with much high carbon dioxide sorption as compared to usual concrete without compromising with the strength of concrete. This study reclaims the potential use of biochar in concrete is reliable for carbon sequestration.</description>

      <title>Decarbonisation &#8211; how are we tracking against plans</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23037</link>

                Globally many countries have committed to reducing carbon dioxide emissions and their dependence on fossil fuels with most large emitting countries now committing to &#8216;net-zero&#8217; targets sometime in the second half of this century and earlier intermediate targets in 2030. With only 6 years to go until the deadline to meet 2030 emission reduction targets, what is the verdict? How are Australian and global emission reduction projects tracking? World electricity demand in 2022 was 28,500 TWh with 39.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted in the same year as a result. The global energy mix hasn&#8217;t changed much: fossil fuel consumption as a percentage of primary energy in 2022 remained steady at 82% and in July 2023 the International Energy Agency projected 2023 oil demand to be 102.1 million barrels a day, an all-time high. This paper will take a look at decarbonisation efforts around the world and provide an overview of what was targeted in previous years and compare it with what has actually been achieved. How far are we truly on the road to decarbonisation? Are decarbonisation initiatives including carbon capture, utilisation and storage, hydrogen projects, solar and wind farms providing the intended results? Incorporating recent key regulatory initiatives from governments around the world including the US, Australia and the EU, this paper will outline progress to date and attempt to show possible paths going forward in answering the question whether it is possible to achieve the proposed emission reduction targets in 6 years.</description>

                Purpose &#8211; Addressing the imperative of sustainable development and environmental conservation, this study investigates the intricate relationship between carbon dioxide emissions and annual fossil fuel subsidies in Slovenia and North Macedonia. Methodology/Approach &#8211; Utilizing regression analysis aligned with the indicators of the twelfth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG), we discern trends in sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and total suspended particulate matter emissions. Findings &#8211; For every billion dollars in subsidies, North Macedonia experiences an average annual reduction of 40.073 kilotons in carbon dioxide emissions, while Slovenia sees an increase of 6.999.431 kilotons per year. The results point out the negative impact fossil fuel subsidies have on the environment by making fossil fuels more affordable, thus warranting further regulation by lowering or eliminating this type of subsidy. Implications &#8211; The implications address the need for research advancement and enhanced SDG reporting in North Macedonia, coupled with a demand for improved environmental indicators in Slovenia. Policymakers can leverage these findings for air pollution regulation, and managers can champion socially responsible practices for a green economy. Originality/Value &#8211; This study fills a critical gap in the literature regarding cross-country comparisons in this area, identified through a Scopus database search.</description>

                Two structurally distinct and biologically privileged succinimide and isoindole heteroarenes bearing benzothiadiazinedioxide motif-centered hybrid conjugates are proficiently achieved through Rh(III)-catalyzed sequential C(sp2)&#8211;H bond activation, ortho-alkenylation and finally cascade intramolecular cyclization. The significant feature of this developed protocol is that the resulting diversely decorated heterocycles contain a quaternary carbon center and this has been coursed through atypical [4 + 1] annulation ignoring the prevalent [4 + 2]-cyclization pathway and interestingly the applied coupling partners (e.g., maleimide, maleate, and styrene) to materialize the protocol functioned only as C1 synthon. Furthermore, the selective reduction strategy enables to modify the hybrid conjugate of succinimide and benzothiazine dioxide to benzothiazine dioxide-based spirocyclic isoindolopyrrolidinedione skeleton following preferential reduction of one carbonyl group of imide functionality. Overall this methodology emerges to be easily handled, versatile, time-efficient, and manifests relatively unfamiliar spiro-cyclization and good functional group tolerance so easy to grab a library of the entirely new variant of decorated hybrid spiro-heterocyclic scaffolds.</description>

      <title>Study on carbon emissions towards flange connection joints of assembled steel structures</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s44242-024-00036-8</link>
      <description>Jianpeng Guo, Yanxia Zhang, Ming-zhao Zheng, Xi Zhao, Bobo Wu, Low-carbon materials and green construction. 2(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4397293942

                Abstract In order to comply with the trend of global climate change, countries are gradually promoting energy conservation and emission reduction, and prefabricated buildings have become one of the main paths for the construction industry to develop towards carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. This paper takes the box-shaped column flange connection achieved by plug welding-core sleeve in the dormitory building of Tongzhou Campus of the Affiliated High School of Capital Normal University in China as the research object. Based on the consumption quota of prefabricated construction projects and the actual project quantity, the carbon emissions of steel structure column connection joints at different phases are calculated by the emission factor method, and it is proposed that the production consumption of building materials plays a key role in energy conservation and emission reduction. This paper concludes that the box-shaped column flange connection achieved by plug welding-core sleeve in the construction phase of an assembled steel building emits 49.5% less carbon dioxide than a conventional full fusion-welded joint. And the reason for the high carbon emissions of the latter is mainly from the amount of materials and machinery required for full penetration welding. It further affirms the green and environmental protection effect of the assembled steel structure plug welding-core sleeve flange connection joint in actual projects, and provides a reference for related research.</description>

                Abstract The unavoidable and unpredictable surface reconstruction of metallic copper (Cu) during the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction process is a double&#8208;edged sword affecting the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added hydrocarbon products. It is crucial to control the surface facet reconstruction and regulate the targeted facets/facet interfaces, and further understand the mechanism between activity/selectivity and the reconstructed structure of Cu for CO 2 reduction. Based on the current catalyst design methods, a facile strategy combining chemical reduction and electro&#8208;reduction is proposed to achieve specified Cu(111) facets and the Cu(110)/(111) interfaces in reconstructed Cu derived from cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O). The surface facet reconstruction significantly boosted the electrocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C 2+ ) products comparing to the unmodified catalyst. Theoretical and experimental analyses show that the Cu(110)/(111)s interface between Cu(110) and a small amount of Cu(111) can tailor the reaction routes and lower the reaction energy barrier of C&#8211;C coupling to ethylene (C 2 H 4 ). The work will guide the surface facets reconstruction strategy for Cu&#8208;based CO 2 electrocatalysts, providing a promising paradigm to understand the structural variation in catalysts.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the Co-Production between the Rice Husk and the Pulp of the Cashew Apple Produced in the Natural Region of Casamance</title>

                Anaerobic digestion or anaerobic digestion is a biological process of degradation of organic matter in an anaerobic environment. It involves the degradation and stabilization of complex organic matter by a consortium of micro-organisms leading to methane-rich biogas that can be used as an alternative energy to fossil fuels. In addition, the use of biogas allows for the preservation of the environment and the sustainable development of rural areas and landlocked regions, as well as the diversification of energy resources, but also contributes to the development of agriculture through the production of organic fertilizer. In 2018, Senegal was ranked as the 15th world exporter of cashew nuts with a production of around 18,000 tons per year according to a study by PADEC (Support Program for the Development of Casamance). Four regions mainly invest in it: Kolda, Ziguinchor, Se&#769;dhiou, and Fatick. However, in the natural region of Casamance ( Kolda, Ziguinchor, and Se&#769;dhiou), each year, after the cashew nut campaign, more than 342,000 tons of cashew apples, pressed or not, are rejected without any recovery, thus degrading in the environment. In addition, rice is traditionally grown in Casamance and in some Diola circles, it had become one of the criteria of wealth, which explains why it occupied most of the cultivated areas and each year thousands of tons of rice husk are burned for elimination/reduction without any recovery. These immense annual productions of waste, without any recovery, in a context dominated by a deficit in cooking and lighting energy constitutes a form of energy resilience and motivates us to study the co-digestion of the rice husk (with a report of C/N equal to 101.317) on cashew apple pulp (having a C/N ratio of 23.201 ). The study of the co-digestion of rice husk and apple pulp at the laboratory scale with the inoculum reveals, that the co-digestion with pH correction contains 39.40% methane and 51.50% carbon dioxide after 49 days of production and 64.04% methane (CH 4 ) and 25.86% carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) on the 96th day. For co-digestion without adjustment, production stopped on the 49th day with a production of 23.68% methane and 45.65% carbon dioxide.</description>

      <title>From carrot to stick &#8211; the impact of a changing landscape of CCS policy and funding in Australia since 1999</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23167</link>
      <description>Rebecca Johnstone, No host. 64(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396974706

                Since 1999 successive Australian Commonwealth governments have provided direct funding for carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) projects, notably the carbon capture and storage (CCS) Flagships Fund (Rudd government, 2009). The most recent CCUS Hubs and Technologies Fund (Morrison government, 2022) was later revoked (Albanese government, 2022) marking a shift from direct funding (&#8216;carrot&#8217;) to emission reduction through a strengthening of the Safeguard Mechanism, the introduction of a 43% emissions reduction target by 2030, and the establishment of the Net Zero Authority (&#8216;stick&#8217;). Reports such as the &#8216;Net Zero Mobilisation Report&#8217;, have delineated the need for, and size of, the role of CCUS in Australia, especially for hard-to-abate sectors and the report states &#8216;private investment in a CCUS industry requires targeted government support&#8217; i.e. funding. As government focus moves from direct funding support for CCS to CCU and direct air capture (DAC), the development of underground geological storage of carbon dioxide will be largely left to fossil fuel emitters, especially large liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies, reflected in current Western Australian government policy (Cook government, 2023) to develop CCS strategy as part of the LNG Jobs Taskforce. The only current exception is CarbonNet, operated by the Victorian government and one of the early CCS Flagship funded projects.</description>

      <title>ETE-SRSP: An Enhanced Optimization of Tramp Ship Routing and Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse12050817</link>
      <description>Xiaohu Huang, Yuhan Liu, Mei Sha, Bing Han, Dezhi Han, Han Liu, Journal of marine science and engineering. 12(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396929827

                In the contemporary tramp shipping industry, route optimization and scheduling are directly linked to enhancements in operations, economics, and the environment, making them key factors for the effective management of maritime transportation. To enhance effective ship-to-cargo matching and the refinement of maritime transportation itineraries, this paper introduces a time efficiency and carbon dioxide emission multi-objective optimization algorithm named ETE-SRSP (efficiency&#8211;time&#8211;emission multi-optimization algorithm). ETE-SRSP incorporates several factors, including the initial positions of ships, time windows for loading and unloading operations, and varying sailing speeds. Within the ETE-SRSP framework, pioneering an approach that integrates ballast and laden sailing velocities as decisional parameters, it employs a multi-objective optimization technique to investigate the intricate interplay between temporal efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, the model&#8217;s proficiency in mitigating emissions and managing costs is clearly demonstrated through the optimization of these objectives, thereby offering a robust framework for decision support. The experimental results show that the optimal sailing speeds derived from the ETE-SRSP, under typical time-weight scenarios, can achieve an optimal balance between emission reduction and cost control. In summary, this study underscores the optimization strategy&#8217;s potential to effectively address the maritime sector&#8217;s need for economic growth and ecological conservation, showcasing its practical value in the industry.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Evolution Trend of China&#8217;s Digital Carbon Footprint: A Simulation Based on System Dynamics Approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16104230</link>
      <description>Ruiheng Xu, Kaiwen Ji, Zichen Yuan, Cheng Wang, Yihan Xia, Sustainability. 16(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4397002348

                The rapid growth of the digital economy has heightened concerns over its environmental impacts, particularly in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. In contrast to previous studies that focus on the positive effects of digital technology on reducing carbon emissions, this paper provides a detailed analysis of the various factors that influence digital economy carbon emissions and their interrelationships, using the system dynamics method to simulate and predict China&#8217;s future digital economy carbon emission baseline from 2016 to 2046. Four different scenarios were established by adjusting parameters for the percentage of the digital economy, e-waste growth rate, and data center power consumption. The simulation results indicate the following: (1) The baseline scenario shows China&#8217;s digital economy carbon emissions peaking at 1.9045 billion tons in 2041 after an initial increase and subsequent decrease. (2) Single-policy simulations indicate that changing the digital economy&#8217;s scale and e-waste growth independently leads to peak emissions of 1.9205 billion tons and 1.5525 billion tons, respectively. Adjusting data center power consumption has a greater impact, increasing the peak emissions to 2.1675 billion tons, a 13.82% rise from the baseline. (3) Under the comprehensive regulation scenario, emissions peak in 2040 at 2.0813 billion tons, considering the interactions between the digital economy, data center power, and e-waste. Based on the findings, we recommend fostering innovation in the digital industry, enhancing the e-waste treatment process, strategically developing digital infrastructure, and exploring effective carbon reduction strategies for the digital economy aimed at supporting China in achieving its dual-carbon goals.</description>

      <title>Monitor and reduce emissions to meet compliance and sustainability goals</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23218</link>
      <description>Nicolas Castelijns, No host. 64(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396975294

                In today&#8217;s climate-conscious world, companies across the globe continue to push to optimise energy use and reduce or eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions. Investments aimed at emission monitoring and reduction are driven by the need to optimise consumption of electricity, gas, oil, and water to meet emissions reduction targets and sustainability goals. Tracking and reducing emissions can improve process uptime through predictive maintenance and reduce product losses across the process. Methane emissions are in particular focus as methane is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated that a third of methane emissions in North America come from the industrial sector, and similar figures come from the European Commission. It is no wonder that government and industry are laser-focussed on improving their approach to the reduction of methane emissions. As companies drive their own corporate standards to achieve net zero emissions, there is also a need to comply with existing and upcoming governmental emissions standards and regulations, and report emissions on a periodic basis. The trend to move fugitive emissions monitoring from periodic to continuous provides operators with a greater insight into emissions sources which drives efficiencies through the reduction of lost product and a more predictive approach to maintenance. Investors are increasingly focussed on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting and favouring companies that can demonstrate strong ESG performance. Fugitive emission leaks can translate into billions of dollars of lost productivity annually, and serious occupational accidents.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Economic Assessments for Post-Combustion Co2 Capture in Natural Gas Combined Cycle with Waste Heat Recovery</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4835058</link>
      <description>Yi Yuan, Lei Wang, Xiaotao Bi, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398152803

                This paper reports a system integration study on natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) with CO2 capture. When the alkali-based CO2 capture system is integrated into a typical NGCC power plant with 134.53 MW net power generation, the extracted steam for desorption unit and additional power for solid circulation lead to 12.05% thermal efficiency reduction. To fully recover the low-level heat of the CO2 capture system, a new integration configuration for NGCC with CO2 capture is proposed by adding an absorption heat transformer. In comparison, the new integrated system fully recovers the low-level heat of the CO2 capture system by sacrificing a portion of power generation. As a result, it provides 110.22 MW extra heat output in trade for a reduction of 21.07 MW power generation. Economic analysis shows that the cost of electricity and cost of avoided CO2 of the new integrated system are reduced by 8.26 $/MWh and 34.74 $/t CO2, respectively, due to the extra economic benefits by heat output.</description>

      <title>Second Coordination Sphere Effects in an Earth-Abundant Monometallic Complex as Catalyst Dictate Highly Selective Photochemical Conversion of CO2 to HCOOH</title>

      <description>Hemlata Agarwala, Vincent Artero, Marc Fontecave, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396914965

                Photochemical reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) using molecular transition metal complexes as catalysts has been previously documented to proceed via either of the two mechanisms: CO2 insertion into metal hydride bonds, or hydrogenation of CO2. We present herein photoreduction of CO2 to HCOOH that adopts both these pathways by a single monometallic molecular catalyst featuring earth-abundant cobalt - a characteristic not observed in other molecular catalysts for CO2 photoreduction to date. This dual functionality stems from distinctly different, active forms of the catalyst, at different temporal stages of irradiation. We employ in situ NMR spectroscopy to monitor potential catalytic intermediates at various time points of irradiation by visible light. These observed states align with the kinetic profiles of product evolution, proving instrumental in revealing the catalyst's unique behavior. We advocate for the integration of such in situ NMR monitoring in future studies as it provides a valuable tool for an informed design of photochemical CO2 reduction by molecular catalysts.</description>

                Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are the primary drivers of global climate change. Human activities, particularly those related to energy production, transportation, and industry, have long contributed to the escalating levels of GHGs in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Recognizing the significance of this issue, universities, including Thammasat University, play a vital role in Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions research and education, carrying a responsibility to address the matter. This study is aimed aims to assess the greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation measures at Thammasat University (Lampang campus), Thailand. The emissions are categorized into 3 types: (1) direct GHG emissions; (2) energy-related indirect GHG emissions; and (3) other indirect GHG emissions. Activity data from the years 2019 to 2022 was used for the calculations, resulting in GHG emissions of 1051.70, 778.28, 558.64, and 1034.531 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Among these emissions, energy-related indirect GHG emissions from electricity purchases represent the majority, accounting for approximately 78.55% of the total emissions. Consequently, implementing mitigation strategies, such as solar panel installations and solid waste reduction (combined scenario), has the potential to reduce GHG emissions by up to 57.78%. Furthermore, the university should actively promote GHG emissions reduction through the enactment of energy-saving policies and the adoption of energy-efficient technologies to reduce reliance on energy purchases.</description>

                Abstract: In the ever-evolving realm of urban transportation, the fusion of technological advancements and ubiquitous mobile connectivity has sparked a paradigm shift in how cities are navi- gated. This shift has led to innovative approaches in ridesharing and crowdsourcing, offering promising solutions to tackle traffic congestion, reduce emissions, and prioritize travel needs in urbanareas. Unlike traditional carpooling methods, where arrange-ments are made in advance, ridesharing in smart cities operates on real-time matching of drivers and riders, with priority given to factors such as destination and purpose.This study delves into the intricate dynamics of ridesharing and crowdsourcing for smart city transportation, investigating the complex interplay between technology and social factors.Additionally, it considers aspects of security, policy, and pricing strategies to ensure a seamlessand equitable experience for all stakeholders.Drawing insights from comprehensive case studies and practical implementations, this exploration highlights the advantages of ridesharing and crowdsourcing, including the reduction of carbon dioxide emis- sions and the prioritization of travel needs based on purpose. It offers guidance for stakeholders navigating the complexities and embracing the transformative potential of these innovative solutions in shaping the future of urban mobility.</description>

                Abstract Modelling of the co-electrolysis process requires understanding of the underlying reaction pathways under H2/H2O/CO/CO2-atmospheres. These include the electrochemical steam reduction/hydrogen oxidation, the electrochemical CO2 reduction/CO oxidation and their coupling via the catalytic (reverse) water gas shift reaction ((R)WGS). The assumption of a very fast RWGS and therefore neglectable electrochemical CO2 conversion is commonly used to model the co-electrolysis process. In contrast, previous studies on Ni/GDC fuel electrodes suggest that the electrochemical conversion of CO / CO2 can be present in H2/H2O/CO/CO2-atmospheres. To deconvolute surface-related and non-surface-related processes in the impedance response we present results from a complex variation of operating parameters for process identification by the use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the subsequent impedance analysis by the distribution of relaxation times. A physically meaningful equivalent circuit model, based on a single channel transmission line, is then derived. The model enables quantification of the surface reaction resistance under varied C/H-ratios. From a kinetic analysis it is shown that the electrochemical H2/H2O conversion is dominant for y_CO+y_(CO_2 )&#8804; 50% and electrochemical CO/CO2-conversion onsets from y_CO+y_(CO_2 )&#8805; 60%.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the potential of optimized PCM-wallboards for reducing energy consumption and CO2 emission in buildings</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2024.114320</link>

                Phase Change Materials (PCMs) in building envelopes have the potential to reduce building energy consumption. The effectiveness of PCMs is influenced by their thermophysical properties, such as melting temperature and transition range, which affect their year-round utilization and overall energy impact. It is therefore important to identify PCM properties that are suitable for each climate. This study aims to identify the optimal melting temperature and transition range that minimize energy consumption across 16 U.S. cities using DOE reference buildings. In addition, to assess the realistic CO2 reduction potential of optimal PCMs, we utilize dynamic CO2 emission factors for electricity generation. The results highlight that improperly selected PCM can lead to increased energy consumption or CO2 emissions. It was also found that the optimal PCM transition range varies with outdoor temperature fluctuations. Optimal PCMs can lead to substantial energy savings&#8212;up to 18.7%, and significant CO2 reductions&#8212;up to 15% for electricity and 38% for natural gas. The results and findings support the deployment of PCM-wallboards with the optimal PCM properties tailored to the target location and climate, which enhance energy performance and contribute to buildings sustainability.</description>

                In an exploration of environmental concerns, this groundbreaking research delves into the relationship between GDP per capita, coal rents, forest rents, mineral rents, oil rents, natural gas rents, fossil fuels, renewables, environmental tax and environment-related technologies on CO2 emissions in 30 highly emitting countries from 1995 to 2021 using instrumental-variables regression Two-Stage least squares (IV-2SLS) regression and two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimates. Our results indicate a significant positive relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions across all quantiles, showcasing an EKC with diminishing marginal effects. Coal rents exhibit a statistically significant negative relationship with emissions, particularly in higher quantiles, and mineral rents show a negative association with CO2 emissions in lower and middle quantiles, reinforcing the idea of resource management in emissions reduction. Fossil fuels exert a considerable adverse impact on emissions, with a rising effect in progressive quantiles. Conversely, renewable energy significantly curtails CO2 emissions, with higher impacts in lower quantiles. Environmental tax also mitigates CO2 emissions. Environment-related technologies play a pivotal role in emission reduction, particularly in lower and middle quantiles, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, highlighting the importance of tailoring interventions to different emission levels and leveraging diverse strategies for sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Influence of Supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Fracturing Fluid on the Permeability of Shale Reservoir and Mechanism Analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c09728</link>

                Reduction of the reservoir permeability during supercritical CO2 fracturing caused significant reservoir damage, which directly affects the crude oil recovery rate. This investigation explored a novel thickener for supercritical CO2 fracturing fluid, this CO2 thickener not only effectively improves the viscosity and rheological properties of CO2 fracturing fluid but also contributes to reduce reservoir damage and improve permeability. The research results indicated that the synthesized CO2 thickener (3 wt %) can increase the apparent viscosity of supercritical CO2 fracturing fluid to 7 mPa&#183;s, and a 9% matrix permeability damage rate and a 0.5 mD permeability decrease value are shown in a 3% CO2 fracturing fluid. However, 3 wt % of commercial CO2 thickener only increases the apparent viscosity of supercritical CO2 fracturing fluid to 3 mPa&#183;s, while the reservoir damage rate increases to 13%. Two thickeners exhibit completely different damage capabilities to the reservoir, and the synthesized CO2 thickener shows excellent characteristics of reducing reservoir permeability and is also conducive to protecting shale reservoirs. Furthermore, supercritical CO2 fracturing fluid containing synthetic thickeners has better temperature and shear resistance compared with commercial thickeners. This may be because the synthesized thickener and the micro grid formed by supercritical CO2 reduce the adsorption in shale crevices, but a large amount of commercial thickeners can adsorb on the surface of shale.</description>

      <title>Mesomorphology of clathrate hydrates from molecular ordering</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0200516</link>
      <description>Carlos L. Bassani, Michael Engel, Amadeu K. Sum, Journal of chemical physics online/&#152;The &#156;Journal of chemical physics/Journal of chemical physics. 160(19)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398132031

                Clathrate hydrates are crystals formed by guest molecules that stabilize cages of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Whereas thermodynamic equilibrium is well described via the van der Waals and Platteeuw approach, the increasing concerns with global warming and energy transition require extending the knowledge to non-equilibrium conditions in multiphase, sheared systems, in a multiscale framework. Potential macro-applications concern the storage of carbon dioxide in the form of clathrates, and the reduction of hydrate inhibition additives currently required in hydrocarbon production. We evidence porous mesomorphologies as key to bridging the molecular scales to macro-applications of low solubility guests. We discuss the coupling of molecular ordering with the mesoscales, including (i) the emergence of porous patterns as a combined factor from the walk over the free energy landscape and 3D competitive nucleation and growth and (ii) the role of molecular attachment rates in crystallization&#8211;diffusion models that allow predicting the timescale of pore sealing. This is a perspective study that discusses the use of discrete models (molecular dynamics) to build continuum models (phase field models, crystallization laws, and transport phenomena) to predict multiscale manifestations at a feasible computational cost. Several advances in correlated fields (ice, polymers, alloys, and nanoparticles) are discussed in the scenario of clathrate hydrates, as well as the challenges and necessary developments to push the field forward.</description>

                In light of growing environmental concerns, the reduction of CO2 emissions is increasingly vital. Particularly in the construction industry, a major contributor to global carbon emissions, addressing this issue is critical for environmental sustainability and mitigating the accelerating impacts of climate change. This study proposes the Optimal Green Design Model for Mega Structures (OGDMM) to optimise CO2 emissions, cost-effectiveness, and serviceability in highrise buildings with mega structures. The OGDMM examines the impact of each material and structural design of main members on these three critical aspects. Analytical results for high-rise buildings (120&#8211;200 m, slenderness ratio: 2.0&#8211;8.0) demonstrate that OGDMM can reduce CO2 emissions and costs by an average of 4.67% and 3.97%, respectively, without compromising serviceability. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, this study introduces five new evaluation indicators encompassing environmental, economic, and serviceability performances of high-rise buildings. Based on these criteria, optimised structural designs for high-rise buildings are classified into four categories according to slenderness ratio, leading to the formulation of corresponding design guidelines. The model&#8217;s applicability is further validated through its application to a 270-m-tall high-rise building in Korea, showing reductions in CO2 emissions and costs by 8.99% and 18.50%, respectively, while maintaining structural serviceability.</description>

                Previous studies on future scenarios identified two key effects of increasing CO2 on the African summer monsoon (ASM): Rising CO2 leads to an enhancement in moisture supply, favoring an increase in ASM precipitation (the thermodynamic effect). However, it also results in a weakening in mean atmospheric flow, thus facilitating a dryness across the ASM region (the dynamic effect). Therefore, the ultimate change in ASM precipitation stems from the balance of both the thermodynamic and dynamic effects. This study further examines the impact of rising CO2 on ASM rainfall, by taking into account various climate states. Our results suggest that an increase in CO2 during warm interglacial periods has a stronger influence from thermodynamic factors than from dynamic factors, resulting in an enhancement in ASM rainfall. In contrast, if CO2 increases under cold glacial climate backgrounds, its dynamic impact dominates a reduction of rainfall in the ASM region.</description>

                Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is increasingly being recognized as an effective and promising technology to reutilize CO2 and convert it into high value-added products, which presents a viable pathway to actualize carbon neutrality. Owing to the distinct affinity of copper (Cu) to the key intermediates of CO2RR, Cu-based electrocatalysts are emerging as highly promising catalysts for producing multi-carbon (C2/2+) products through CO2RR. Notably, the deliberate design and advancement of Cu-based catalysts stand as pivotal factors in actualizing efficient and selective electrochemical reduction of CO2. In this review, we first elucidate the reaction pathways of Cu-based electrocatalysts for the synthesis of C2/2+ products. Then, various strategies toward the regulation of the structure of Cu-based catalysts are summarized, aiming to disclose the "structure-performance relationship". Meanwhile, the important advances regarding the catalyst/electrolyte interface engineering as well as the electrolyte optimization toward improved C2/2+ production are also included. Lastly, the review concludes by critically summarizing both findings and perspectives and how this promising field might advance in the future.</description>

                Methanol is emerging as a highly versatile energy carrier, presenting a wide range of applications in transportation and industrial processes, offering viable alternatives to hydrogen-focused strategies. Its role within the "Methanol Economy" and as an energy reservoir highlights its potential as both a transitional fuel and a crucial chemical feedstock. Beyond its function as a fuel, methanol contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts and environmental risk mitigation. Advancements in fuel cell technologies further strengthen methanol's position in clean energy solutions, positioning it as an essential component in constructing a sustainable energy framework. The methanol production process involves diverse pathways and technologies, each with distinct advantages and challenges. These pathways include natural gas reforming, coal and biomass gasification, and carbon dioxide hydrogenation. Catalytic processes, notably employing copper-based catalysts like Cu/ZnO/Al2O3, play a pivotal role despite persistent challenges such as thermal stability and selectivity. Catalyst promoters such as Au, ZrO2, and alkali metals significantly enhance catalyst performance. Various reactor technologies, including gas-phase and liquid-phase systems, efficiently manage synthesis reactions while optimizing efficiency and selectivity. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of different methanol production processes, the catalysts and promoters utilized, and various reactor technologies employed in this process.</description>

      <title>IMPACT OF SHADING DEVICES ON COOLING LOAD IN EDUCATIONAL BUILDINGS</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3992/jgb.19.2.223</link>
      <description>Sofiane Rahmouni, Antar Si Mohammed, Journal of green building. 19(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396933488

                ABSTRACT This paper examines the influence of shading devices in non-residential buildings on enhancing cooling loads, mitigating environmental impact, and reducing energy consumption in semi-arid climates. The focus is on educational buildings as part of Algeria's national strategy to enhance sustainability and decrease energy usage. To achieve this, a comparative analysis was conducted, encompassing both numerical and experimental assessments of the effects of four indoor shading techniques and three outdoor shading techniques. Subsequently, the impact of the optimal shading combination on four main orientations was evaluated using dynamic building simulation software. The outcomes demonstrate that the optimal combination of shading devices substantially affects cooling loads, leading to noteworthy energy savings and a reduction in CO2 emissions. Notably, these savings can reach up to 7% in cooling load reduction and up to 32% in energy and CO2 emission reductions. Furthermore, the study concludes that distinct design considerations should be tailored to climate attributes and building orientations to achieve maximal cooling load reductions. This research enriches the existing knowledge concerning the optimization of shading devices for educational buildings with a focus on cooling load reduction. The findings emphasize the necessity for architects, builders, and proprietors to incorporate passive design alternatives that align optimally with energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and overall building sustainability.</description>

                A Cu/Co tandem catalysis protocol was developed to conduct the hydroformylation of olefins using CO2/H2 and PMHS (polymethylhydrosiloxane) as a readily available and environmentally friendly hydride source. This methodology was performed via a two-step approach consisting of the copper-catalyzed reduction of CO2 by hydrosilane and subsequent cobalt-promoted hydroformylation with H2 and the in situ formed CO. The optimized triphos oxide ligand, which presumably facilitates the migratory insertion of CO gives moderate to excellent yields for both terminal and internal alkenes. This earth-abundant metal catalysis provides a reliable and efficient way to afford useful aldehydes in industry using silicon by-product PMHS as hydrogen source and renewable CO2 as carbonyl source.</description>

                Growing trend of air pollution has become one of the familiar environmental hazards for the society. It is a mixture of toxic compounds emerging from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Depending on the source and rate of emission the components of air pollution change dramatically. The primary human-made sources of air pollution may include vehicle emissions, natural gas to heat homes, fuel oils, and by-products of manufacturing and power generation and fumes from chemical production. In addition to that, various hazardous substances such as methane and other gases are released by decomposing organic matter in soils, and other gases include ash and smoke from volcanic eruptions, which are frequently caused by humans. Various reports around the world have consistently demonstrated that air pollution is a significant adaptable risk factor for enhanced mortality. Air pollutants can harm the health of humans, animals, plants, and buildings. The pollutants are in the form of gases, solid particles, or liquid droplets. Ozone (O3), nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2) are some of the gaseous pollutants that contribute to air pollution. The pollution is now the leading environmental cause of premature death. Cardiovascular events such as acute ischemic account for the majority of the additional mortality caused by air pollution. Aside from increased mortality, air contamination is linked to significant reductions in worker productivity. Exposure to air pollution has a wide range of negative consequences on people's health. The effects of air pollution can be divided into short-term and long-term effects. The discomfort, such as irritation to the nose, eyes, throat or skin, as well as infections like bronchitis are short-term symptoms that are transient. It can also cause headaches, nausea and dizziness. The long-term effects of pollution can last for years and cause various respiratory diseases. Long-term damage to people's nerves, brains, kidneys, liver, and other organs, birth defects are the consequences of air pollution (Brook et al. 2004; Newby et al. 2015; Zivin and Neidell 2018; Hamanaka and Mutlu 2018).</description>

      <title>Changes in Mean Seasonal Carbon Cycle Due to Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.20.594964</link>

                Through photosynthesis, forests absorb annually massive amounts of atmospheric CO2. However, they also release CO2 back through respiration. The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) determines how much carbon forests store or release. The mean seasonal cycle (MSC) is an interesting metric that associate phenology and carbon (C) partitioning-allocation within forest stands. Here we applied the 3D-CMCC-FEM model and analyzed its capability to represent the main C-fluxes, by validating the model against observed data, questioning if the sink/source mean seasonality is influenced under two scenarios of climate change, in five European forest sites. We found the model showing under current climate conditions robust predictive abilities in estimating NEE. The analysis also reveals a consistent reduction of the forest's capabilities to act as a C-sink under climate change and stand-ageing at all sites. Such a reduction is modelled despite the number of annual days of C-sink in evergreen increasing over the years, indicating a consistent downward trend. Similarly, deciduous forests, despite maintaining a relatively stable number of C-sink days throughout the year and over the century, show a reduction in the overall annual C-sink capacity. Overall both types of forests at all sites show a consistent reduction in their future mitigating potential.</description>

      <title>A holistic life cycle assessment of steel bridge deck pavement</title>

                Transportation serves as a cornerstone of economic development and is a significant contributor to carbon emissions. This study established a life cycle assessment model that incorporates refined carbon emission calculation parameters, streamlining the computation process while maintaining precision. A case study was conducted to quantify the life-cycle CO2 emissions of steel bridge deck pavements, a pivotal component within the transport network. The study suggests using the average annual CO2 emissions as a metric to gauge the carbon emission potential of steel bridge deck pavements with different service lives. This study addresses a void in the existing work by standardizing the grading of typical pavement diseases and quantifying the carbon emissions of the corresponding maintenance measures. It reveals that the pivotal determinant of life-cycle CO2 emissions for steel bridge deck pavements is the service performance of the paving material. Comparative analysis indicates that epoxy asphalt concrete could be deemed a low-carbon material, achieving a 77.6% reduction in life-cycle carbon emissions compared to gussasphalt concrete. Emissions during the maintenance phase constitute 66.7%&#8211;71.4% of the total life-cycle emissions, predominantly due to end-of-life and traffic delay units. The methodology and calculated data presented herein can inform subsequent carbon reduction strategies in transportation and promote the development of resilient infrastructure, thus making a substantial contribution towards carbon neutrality and climate change mitigation.</description>

      <title>Methane production and oxidation&#8212;A review on the pmoA and mcrA genes abundance for understanding the functional potentials of the agricultural soil</title>

                Global efforts to avert climate change cannot be successfully addressed without tackling the emission of methane from soil and other ecosystems. Methane is a greenhouse gas that retains heat in the atmosphere and causes global warming. Its production is the last step of organic matter decomposition and is produced by methanogenic archaea bearing the functional gene &#8211; mcrA (Methyl-coenzyme M reductase). Methane production involves the reduction of acetate or carbon dioxide in a microaerophilic or anaerobic environment under the catalytic actions of methyl coenzyme M to generate methane. On the other hand, methane oxidizing bacteria, also known as methanotrophs, through the catalytic actions of the pmoA gene (particulate methane monooxygenase), oxidize methane and reduce its emission to the atmosphere. In essence, production and consumption of methane both happen within the soil. Methanotrophs and methanogenic microbes inhabit the same soil environment. In fact, a shift in the balance between methanogens and methanotrophs activities and abundance could influence either increase in soil methane emission and control or the corresponding effects on global warming. In this review we highlight recent advances on the drivers of methane flux, pmoA and mcrA genes abundance, methane emission and control, linking microbial functional genes abundance to soil function, and examining methods for studying the abundance of pmoA and mcrA genes in the soil. We also highlight gaps that need to be filled and the impact of the mcrA to pmoA gene ratio in driving the methane emission rate in the soil. We also discussed the various abiotic factors that control pmoA and mcrA gene abundance</description>

                Abstract. The escalating climate crisis requires rapid action to reduce the concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases and lower global surface temperatures. Methane will play a critical role in near-term warming due to its high radiative forcing and short atmospheric lifetime. Methane emissions have accelerated in recent years, and there is significant risk and uncertainty associated with the future growth in natural emissions. The largest natural sink of methane occurs through oxidation reactions with atmospheric hydroxyl and chlorine radicals. Enhanced atmospheric oxidation could be a potential approach to remove atmospheric methane. One method proposes the addition of iron salt aerosol (ISA) to the atmosphere, mimicking a natural process proposed to occur when mineral dust mixes with chloride from sea spray to form iron chlorides, which are photolyzed by sunlight to produce chlorine radicals. Under the right conditions, lofting ISA into the atmosphere could potentially reduce atmospheric methane concentrations and lower global surface temperatures. Recognizing that potential atmospheric methane removal must only be considered an additive measure &#8211; in addition to, not replacing, crucial anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission reductions and carbon dioxide removal &#8211; roadmaps can be a valuable tool to organize and streamline interdisciplinary and multifaceted research to efficiently move towards understanding whether an approach may be viable and socially acceptable or if it is nonviable and further research should be deprioritized. Here we present a 5-year research roadmap to explore whether ISA enhancement of the chlorine radical sink could be a viable and socially acceptable atmospheric methane removal approach.</description>

      <title>Metal active sites regulation in copper phthalocyanine/bismuth vanadate Z-scheme heterojunction by electron-withdrawing substituent for selective CO2 photoreduction in pure water</title>

                Here, a Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst by integration of copper phthalocyanine with carboxyl grafting (CuTcPc) and BiVO4 nanosheets (BVO) via the hydroxyl induced assembly strategy has been developed for selective CO2 photoreduction. The optimal CuTcPc/BVO catalyst delivers a 21-fold increments in CO yields compared with pristine BVO and 91 % selectivity towards CO2 reduction, coupled with nearly stoichiometric O2 in pure water. As unraveled by experimental results and theoretical simulations, the remarkably improved photoactivity is attributed to the complementary light absorption of BVO and CuTcPc, the enhanced charge transfer and separation due to the formation of Z-scheme heterojunction and most importantly the preferable CO2 adsorption and activation brought by the adjusted local coordination and electronic environment of central Cu-N4 sites by electron-withdrawing substituents. This study provides a feasible avenue to manipulate the active sites from the perspective of functional substitute tailoring on metal phthalocyanine over novel BiVO4-based Z-scheme heterojunctions for artificial photosynthesis.</description>

      <title>CO2 capture through direct-contact condensation in a spray ejector condenser and T- junction separator</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icheatmasstransfer.2024.107596</link>
      <description>Milad Amiri, Micha&#322; Klugmann, Jaros&#322;aw Mikielewicz, Pawe&#322; Zi&#243;&#322;kowski, Dariusz Mikielewicz, International communications in heat and mass transfer. 156(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398190234

                The design principle underlying the steam condensation and CO2 purification in a gas power plant with a focus on reducing CO2 emissions encompasses the deployment of a spray ejector condenser (SEC) and separator. This innovative system facilitates direct-contact condensation of steam with non-condensable gas (CO2) by interacting with a spray of subcooled water, seamlessly integrated with a T-junction separator mechanism aimed at yielding pure CO2. Because of decreased convective heat transfer and heightened diffusion resistance between the subcooled water and steam phases caused by CO2, the research examined the effects of various thermophysical parameters of the injected water, specifically temperature (20&#8211;40 &#176;C) and pressure (12&#8211;16 bar) along with steam mass flow rates (2.2&#8211;4.6 gs) to improve heat transfer rates within the SEC. The SEC utilizes a Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase model, wherein water is considered the continuous phase while the mixture of steam and CO2 constitutes the dispersed phase. Turbulence within the ejector is represented applying standard k-&#949; model. Furthermore, the separator employs turbulence and operates in three dimensions using the control volume method. The simulation of turbulent two-phase flow in the gas-liquid T-junction separator is conducted utilizing standard k-&#949; turbulence model and a mixture model. The results imply that the maximum temperature difference (&#916;T) between inlet and outlet of SEC is observed when the steam mass flow rate is 2.2 (g/s) without CO2, while the presence of CO2 leads to a reduction in &#916;T. Additionally, the performance of the SEC is notably affected by the optimal settings of water temperature and pressure, where lower coolant water temperatures (20&#176;C) and higher water pressures (16 bar) contribute to improved condensation performance. Furthermore, the study explores the decrease in separation efficiency associated with elevated inlet mass flow rate, attributed to maldistribution in the vertical impact T-junction separator.</description>

                Considering the alarming frequency of coal mine gas disasters globally, there is an urgent need to develop efficient gas control technologies to ensure mining safety. This study focuses on the problem of high peak gas emission restriction in the process of coal roadway tunneling in outburst coal seams, taking the No. 15 outburst coal seam of the Pingshu Coal Mine as the research object. Based on coal sample testing analysis and the application of CO2 gas fracturing (CO2-Frac) in coal mines, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted on pore-fracture structure alteration and homogenization gas emission effect induced by CO2-Frac, providing technical solutions for coal mine safety production. The results are as follows: (1) CO2-Frac induces fracture propagation and the development of three types of fracture structures: Tri-Wing Fracture, Damage Markers, and Coal Matrix Fragmentation. (2) Following CO2-Frac at 150 MPa, the pore volume and average diameter of pores in the 100&#8211;10,000 nm range increased by 128% and 61%, respectively, compared to the pre-CO2-Frac state. (3) During the excavation period, continuous monitoring of the airflow for 3 days showed a significant homogenization of gas emission, with a maximum value of 0.450% and a variance value of 0.0031, indicating a reduction of 31% and 68%, respectively. These results reveal several key findings: The pore-fracture structure alteration enhances gas diffusion and permeation, providing high-speed pathways for gas migration, resulting in a substantial increase in gas extraction efficiency. During coal cutting, the modified coal exhibits homogenized gas emission, eliminating the high peak phenomenon and achieving safe and efficient mining. These findings demonstrate that CO2-Frac has broad potential in gas emission homogenization for widespread application in coal mines with similar gas geological conditions.</description>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been widely studied as a promising means to convert anthropogenic CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels. In this process, the alkali metal ions present in the electrolyte are known to significantly influence the CO2RR activity and selectivity. In this study, we report a strategy for preparing efficient electrocatalysts by introducing a cation&#8208;relaying ligand, namely 6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA), into atom&#8208;precise Au25 nanoclusters (NCs). The CO2RR activity of the synthesized Au25(MHA)18 NCs was compared with that of Au25(HT)18 NCs (HT = 1&#8208;hexanethiolate). While both NCs selectively produced CO over H2, the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity of the Au25(MHA)18 NCs was significantly higher than that of the Au25(HT)18 NCs when the catholyte pH was higher than the pKa of MHA, demonstrating the cation&#8208;relaying effect of the anionic terminal group. Mechanistic investigations into the CO2RR occurring on the Au25 NCs in the presence of different catholyte cations and concentrations revealed that the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activities of these Au25 NCs increased in the order Li+ &lt; Na+ &lt; K+ &lt; Cs+, and are gated by the cation&#8208;coupled electron transfer step. These results were confirmed by the Nernstian shifts of the polarization curves at different cation concentrations.</description>

                Epicardial (Epi) access is commonly required during ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation. Conventional Epi (ConvEpi) access targets a "dry" pericardial space presenting technical challenges and risk of complications. Recently, intentional puncture of coronary venous (CV) branches with Epi carbon dioxide insufflation (EpiCO2) has been described as a technique to improve Epi access. The safety of this technique relative to conventional methods remains unproven. To compare the feasibility and safety of EpiCO2 to ConvEpi access. All patients at a high-volume center undergoing Epi access between 1/2021 and 12/2023 were included and grouped according to ConvEpi or EpiCO2 approaches. Access technique was according to the discretion of the operator. Epi access was attempted in 153 cases by 17 different operators (80 ConvEpi vs 73 EpiCO2). There was no difference in success rate whether ConvEpi or EpiCO2 approach was used (76 [95%] vs 67 [91.8%], p=0.4). Total Epi access time was shorter in the ConvEpi group compared to the EpiCO2 group (16.3&#177;11.6min vs 26.9&#177;12.7min, p&lt;0.001), though total procedure duration was similar. Major Epi-access related complications occurred in only the ConvEpi group (6 [7.5%] ConvEpi vs 0 [0%] EpiCo2, p=0.02). Bleeding &#8805; 80 mL was more frequently observed following ConvEpi access (14 [17.5%] vs 4 [5.5%], p=0.02). After adjusting for age, repeat Epi access and antithrombotic therapy, EpiCO2 was associated with a reduction in bleeding &#8805; 80 mL (OR=0.27, 95%CI 0.08 &#8211; 0.89, p=0.03). EpiCO2 access is associated with lower rates of major complication and bleeding when compared to ConvEpi access.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Overview of Network Slicing for Improving the Energy Efficiency of Fifth-Generation Networks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/s24103242</link>
      <description>Josip L&#246;rincz, Amar Kukuruzovi&#263;, Zoran Bla&#382;evi&#263;, Sensors. 24(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398140924

                The introduction of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks leads to an increase in energy consumption and higher operational costs for mobile network operators (MNOs). Consequently, the optimization of 5G networks&#8217; energy efficiency is crucial, both in terms of reducing MNO costs and in terms of the negative environmental impact. However, many aspects of the 5G mobile network technology itself have been standardized, including the 5G network slicing concept. This enables the creation of multiple independent logical 5G networks within the same physical infrastructure. Since the only necessary resources in 5G networks need to be used for the realization of a specific 5G network slice, the question of whether the implementation of 5G network slicing can contribute to the improvement of 5G and future sixth-generation networks&#8217; energy efficiency arises. To tackle this question, this review paper analyzes 5G network slicing and the energy demand of different network slicing use cases and mobile virtual network operator realizations based on network slicing. The paper also overviews standardized key performance indicators for the assessment of 5G network slices&#8217; energy efficiency and discusses energy efficiency in 5G network slicing lifecycle management. In particular, to show how efficient network slicing can optimize the energy consumption of 5G networks, versatile 5G network slicing use case scenarios, approaches, and resource allocation concepts in the space, time, and frequency domains have been discussed, including artificial intelligence-based implementations of network slicing. The results of the comprehensive discussion indicate that the different implementations and approaches to network slicing pave the way for possible further reductions in 5G MNO energy costs and carbon dioxide emissions in the future.</description>

                The reduction of carbon emissions has become a critical global issue, and the use of monoethanolamine (MEA) solution for CO2 absorption is prevalent in industry. To elucidate the mass transfer mechanisms in reactive multiphase flow, we employed high-speed photography and digital image processing to examine the dynamics and mass transfer behavior of CO2 bubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell. The results indicate that as the MEA solution concentration increases, oscillations during bubble ascent diminish, and the terminal velocity decreases. Based on changes in the mass transfer coefficient, the reaction process can be segmented into a phase of intensified mass transfer, marked by a rapid decrease in bubble equivalent diameter, and a phase of deteriorating mass transfer, where the diameter stabilizes. Additionally, we introduced a dimensionless mathematical model for the Sherwood number based on experimental findings, and its reliability was confirmed.</description>

                This paper investigates the feasibility of iron powder energy generation systems on board a semi-submersible crane vessel. This is done using a design model that integrates design information and a simulated mission profile to determine a hybrid iron powder setup split. This setup is then placed within a set of vessel designs to calculate a base level feasibility looking at the draft, stability, and emissions decrease. For those concepts that were technically feasible, the new hybrid iron powder setup contributed to a reduction of CO2 up to 25-50% and a reduction of NOx emissions between 15-50%, depending on the mission profile.</description>

                As the uncertainty in energy supply increases, engaging various flexible resources in power systems has emerged as an effective strategy to address wind curtailment issues. Existing research insufficiently explores how EAFs can participate in reducing wind curtailment or optimizing flexible power system resources to decrease CO2 emissions from TTPs and enhance wind energy absorption across various timescales. This study introduces a dual timescale, dual-tier scheduling methodology incorporating EAF regulation and wind power modal decomposition. The day-ahead model integrates EAF demand response to decrease wind curtailment, a comprehensive wind power allocation, and a TTP carbon minimization model. The intra-day model employs wind power modal decomposition for optimizing BESSs within WFs and schedules TTPs to minimize CO2 emissions. Implemented through iterative genetic algorithms and CPLEX solver techniques, simulation results from a real-case scenario indicate that incorporating EAF loads reduces wind curtailment by 40.49% and cuts CO2 emissions by 2.5% in the day-ahead phase. Furthermore, by applying modal decomposition, TTPs and BESSs absorb fluctuating wind power components, ensuring maximal wind utilization and substantial CO2 reduction at TTPs. This approach offers vast potential to enhance power system flexibility, advance energy-intensive industries' transition, and foster low-carbon initiatives at TTPs.</description>

      <title>Effect of Sex on Sympatho-inhibitors and Non-inhibitor Phenotypes during Acute Hyperoxia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1152/physiol.2024.39.s1.308</link>
      <description>Jinan Saboune, Charlotte W. Usselman, Margie H. Davenport, Craig D. Steinback, Physiology. 39(S1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398165828

                Acute hyperoxia (i.e., breathing air consisting of 100% oxygen, O 2 ) reduces muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), positioning hyperoxia as a potential anti-hypertensive therapeutic. However, the link between hyperoxia and MSNA has not been established in females. We tested the hypothesis that males would exhibit greater reductions in MSNA during hyperoxia than females. We tested healthy females (n=18, 27&#177;5yr, body mass index [BMI] 23&#177;3kg/m 2 ) and males (n=13, 27&#177;5yr, 25&#177;3kg/m 2 ) of similar age (P=0.99) and BMI (P=0.08). Integrated MSNA, blood pressure, and end-tidal O 2 (ET O2 ) and CO 2 (ET CO2 ) were measured during normal room air breathing (BSL; 3-min) and hyperoxic breathing (100% O 2 ; 3-min). Integrated MSNA was quantified as burst frequency (BF; bursts/min), amplitude (BA; a.u.), and total MSNA (a.u.); blood pressure was quantified as mean arterial pressure (MAP). Baseline MSNA BF was not different between females and males (24&#177;7 vs 23&#177;8 bursts/min, respectively, P=0.68); MAP was lower in females than males (85&#177;7 vs 93&#177;7 mmHg; p&lt;0.01). Hyperoxia increased ET O2 (effect of cond: p&lt;0.01) and reduced ET CO2 (effect of cond: p&lt;0.01) in a manner similar between sexes for ET O2 (sex*cond: P=0.56) whereas ET CO2 decreased more in females than males (sex*cond: P=0.01). Overall, hyperoxia evoked reductions in MSNA BF (effect of cond: P=0.02) but not BA (effect of cond: P=0.80) or total MSNA (effect of cond: P=0.26). Nadir MSNA responses during hyperoxia unveiled sex differences insofar as total MSNA was reduced consistently only in males (sex*cond: P=0.04); within the females we observed the presence of sympatho-inhibitors and non-inhibitors. Whereas female and male inhibitors reduced total MSNA via substantial reductions in BF and non-significant reductions in BA, female non-inhibitors demonstrated limited reductions in BF (P=0.11 vs inhibitors) coupled with increases in BA (p&lt;0.01 vs inhibitors), resulting in no net change in total MSNA (p&lt;0.01 vs inhibitors). Overall, these findings indicate sex differences exist in the sympathetic response to hyperoxia, in marked variability in the female sympathetic response to acute hyperoxia.

                Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to ethanol has been widely researched for potential commercial application. However, it still faces limited selectivity at a large current density. Herein, Mo4+-doped CuS nanosheet-assembled hollow spheres are constructed to address this issue. Mo4+ ion doping modifies the local electronic environments and diversifies the binding sites of CuS, which increases the coverage of linear *COL and produces bridge *COB for subsequent *COL&#8211;*COH coupling toward ethanol production. The optimal Mo9.0%&#8211;CuS can electrocatalyze CO2 to ethanol with a faradaic efficiency of 67.5% and a partial current density of 186.5 mA cm&#8211;2 at &#8722;0.6 V in a flow cell. This work clarifies that doping high valence transition metal ions into Cu-based sulfides can regulate the coverage and configuration of related intermediates for ethanol production during the CO2RR in a flow cell.</description>

      <title>Life Cycle Economic and Environmental Assessment of Producing Synthetic Jet Fuel Using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Biomass Feedstocks</title>

                The aviation industry is responsible for over 2% of global CO2 emissions. Synthetic jet fuels generated from biogenic feedstocks could help reduce life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to petroleum-based fuels. This study assesses three processes for producing synthetic jet fuel via the synthesis of methanol using water and atmospheric CO2 or biomass. A life cycle assessment and cost analysis are conducted to determine GHG emissions, energy demand, land occupation, water depletion, and the cost of producing synthetic jet fuel in Switzerland. The results reveal that the pathway that directly hydrogenates CO2 to methanol exhibits the largest reductions in terms of GHG emission (almost 50%) compared to conventional jet fuel and the lowest production cost (7.86 EUR kgJF&#8211;1); however, its production cost is currently around 7 times higher than the petroleum-based counterpart. Electrical energy was found to be crucial in capturing CO2 and converting water into hydrogen, with the sourcing and processing of the feedstocks contributing to 79% of the electric energy demand. Furthermore, significant variations in synthetic jet fuel cost and GHG emissions were shown when the electricity source varies, such as utilizing grid electricity pertaining to different countries with distinct electricity mixes. Thus, upscaling synthetic jet fuels requires energy-efficient supply chains, sufficient feedstock, large amounts of additional (very) low-carbon energy capacity, suitable climate policy, and comprehensive environmental analyses.</description>

      <title>Utilization of Charcoal Obtained from Woody Biomass in Metallurgical Processes Based on Solid&#8211;Gas Reactions</title>

                The high demand for carbon-based products within pyrometallurgy is placing the industry in an increasingly challenging position to meet stringent requirements. To transition away from fossil carbon carriers, biochar emerges as a sustainable and CO2-neutral alternative, presenting a viable solution without necessitating fundamental adjustments to plant technology, unlike hydrogen as an alternative reducing agent. Prior investigations have underscored the potential of woody biomass pyrolysis products for CO2-neutral metallurgy. Nonetheless, it is imperative to recognize that biochar must meet distinct requirements across various metallurgical processes. This paper conducts a comparative analysis between biochar and petroleum coke using thermogravimetric analyses, surface measurements, reactivity assessments, and scanning electron microscopy. Furthermore, the performance in a furnace for simulating the Waelz process, specifically regarding ZnO reduction, is scrutinized. The results illustrate the optical differences between petroleum coke and biochar and the significantly higher reactivity and specific surface area of biochar. When used in solid&#8211;gas reactors, it is observed that due to its high reactivity, biochar reacts more vigorously and carbon is completely consumed. However, during the reduction of ZnO, only minor differences were monitored, making biochar comparable to petroleum coke. Therefore, under certain constraints, biochar can be considered a potential substitute for metallurgical solid&#8211;gas reactions.</description>

                Abstract Lightweight and multifunctional polymer foams reveal a promising prospect, in terms of reducing energy consumption, and saving materials and resources. Herein, carbon dioxide (CO2) was captured through three amines, such as ethylenediamine (EDA), 1,3-propylenediamine (PDA) and 1,2-cyclohexanediamine (TRK). CO2 then released under heat, used as a foaming agent in the preparation of polyethylene (PE) foams. Cyclodextrin nanosponge (NS) was used as a heterogeneous nucleating agent and a carrier for complex of captured CO2. Evaluation system was developed to control the conditions of combine process, such as thermal and crystallization properties. Results showed that TRK was the proper CO2 capture candidate, with mass ratio of 1:4 for NS and TRK (NS:TRK-CO2(1:4)), and the release temperature of CO2 was 137 &#8451;. Foamed PE composite was prepared by molding process with NS:TRK-CO2(1:4). The optimum cell morphology was obtained with 5 wt% NS:TRK-CO2(1:4), the cell diameter was 116 &#181;m, and the cell density was 7.9&#215;104 cell/cm3. The best fabricated microcellular PE/NS:TRK-CO2(1:4) composite presented excellent mechanical, thermal and sound insulating performance. The maximum tensile strength of the PE composite was 25.48 MPa, and the maximum bending strength was 11.27 MPa. The impact strength was 5.77 KJ&#8226;m-2, more than 1.5 times higher than pure PE. The thermal conductivity was as low as 0.076 W/m&#8226;k, the sound absorption coefficient was 0.737 at 1500 Hz, and the noise reduction coefficient was 0.459.</description>

                2,3-Diaryl propanoic acids are important structures as a result of their widespread presence in numerous bioactive compounds. However, the limitations of existing synthetic techniques include the requirement for costly catalysts and limited substrates. Here, we developed a novel electroreductive arylcarboxylation of alkenes with CO2 based on a radical&#8211;polar crossover pathway assisted by easily accessible dimethyl terephthalate as a reductive mediator. This method will provide an efficient strategy for the synthesis of 2,3-diarylpropanoic acids.</description>

      <title>Modulating Activity and Selectivity of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electroreductions at Au&#8211;Water Interfaces via Engineering Local Cation Condition</title>

                The mechanistic understanding of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) under electrochemical conditions is crucial for optimizing the overall catalytic performance. While electrolyte ions have received considerable attention, it remains unclear how the condition of interfacial cations modulates the CO2RR and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we explore the CO2 activation and Volmer step representing the critical first electron transfer during the CO2RR and HER, respectively. This investigation involves manipulating the cation identity (K+, Li+, and H+) and concentration at Au&#8211;water interfaces, which is carried out via the slow-growth sampling approach integrated with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results demonstrate that the high local alkali metal cation (AM+) concentration facilitates the CO2RR following the order of 2K+ &gt; 1K+ &gt; 2Li+ &gt; 1Li+ &gt; 0AM+, and the highly promoted CO2 activation kinetics originate from the short-range coordination between alkali metal cations and reaction intermediates. However, the interfacial HER behaves very differently with the kinetic order of 1Li+ &gt; 0AM+ &gt; 1K+ &gt; 2Li+ &gt; 2K+, closely related to the interfacial water structures, which are affected by both cation identity and local concentrations. Overall, the activity and selectivity of the CO2RR at the Au&#8211;water interface can be enhanced by increasing the local cation concentration (K+ &gt; Li+). These findings highlight the critical roles of alkali metal cations and reaction microenvironments in modulating interfacial reaction kinetics.</description>

      <title>Selective Electrosynthesis of Ethanol via Asymmetric C&#8211;C Coupling in Tandem CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c01579</link>

                Selective electroreduction of CO2 to ethanol has economic value and environmental significance. However, the activity and selectivity of CO2 reduction toward ethanol are still low due to the sluggish kinetics of C&#8211;C coupling and the intense competition of hydrocarbon production. Herein, we report a layered tandem catalyst consisting of Cu nanosheets with a Cu(111)-oriented surface and Ag nanoparticles, which can effectively shift the selectivity from hydrocarbons to ethanol. The Faradaic efficiency of ethanol was improved from less than 30% on bare Cu(111) to 56.5 &#177; 2.6% on the layered Cu/Ag tandem catalysts, with a partial current density of 356.7 &#177; 9.5 mA cm&#8211;2. In situ Raman spectroscopy results and density functional theory calculations suggest that the high selectivity toward ethanol can be attributed to the asymmetric *CH2&#8211;CO coupling mechanism, which is facilitated by the selective generation of *CH2 species on (111)-facet-exposed Cu nanosheets and the high local CO concentration supplied by the Ag catalyst.</description>

      <title>Measuring Adsorbate Profiles in Heterogeneous Catalytic Reactors by Iso-Potential Operando DRIFTS Applied to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Methanation on Ni</title>

                The development and improvement of catalytic processes require a detailed understanding of catalyst dynamics, reaction mechanisms, and structure&#8211;activity relationships inside catalytic reactors, from the laboratory to production scale. This paper presents the methodology of iso-potential operando DRIFTS for measuring the profiles of surface adsorbates inside catalytic reactors. Iso-potential operando spectroscopy (IPOS) in general and iso-potential operando DRIFTS in particular separate the functionality "catalytic reactor" and "spectroscopic cell" from each other. The catalytic reactor is equipped with a mechanism of spatial sampling and spatial temperature measurement. A small fraction of the reaction mixture is sampled locally in the reactor and transferred continuously into a spectroscopic cell containing a very small amount of the same catalyst as in the reactor. The temperature is set to the same value as is locally measured in the reactor. In this way, the catalyst in the spectroscopic cell is exposed to the same chemical potential as that locally in the catalytic reactor. It is hypothesized that it takes on the same structure, the same surface adsorbates, and shows the same reactivity. IPO DRIFTS is applied to CO2 methanation on Ni/&#947;-Al2O3 catalysts. Two surface adsorbate species, adsorbed carbonyl (*COads) and adsorbed formate (*HCOOads), are detected. The band intensity of *HCOOads decreases along the catalyst bed with the CO2 concentration in the gas phase, identifying surface formate as a kinetically relevant intermediate. This finding is in line with an associative mechanism where CO2 adsorbs on &#947;-Al2O3 forming carbonate or bicarbonate, being rapidly hydrogenated to formate. Formate reduction is the rate-determining step, with all subsequent hydrogenation steps to CH4 being fast. The band intensity of *COads does not change, irrespective of position in the catalyst bed. This invariance of *COads can be interpreted in two ways. *COads could be a spectator species that is present at the catalyst surface but not involved in any kinetically relevant reaction channel. Alternatively, *COads could be formed by rapid dissociative adsorption of CO2 at the surface of the Ni nanoparticles with a high adsorption equilibrium constant, leading to an almost constant *COads coverage within the investigated CO2 conversion range. If the rate-determining step in the reaction sequence to CH4 would then occur after the formation of *COads, e.g., *COads &#8594; *Cads + *Oads or *COads + *Hads &#8594; *HCOads, an almost constant *COads signal would result as well.</description>

                Carbon-based materials with single-atom (SA) transition metals coordinated with nitrogen (M-Nx) have attracted extensive attention due to their superior electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) performance. However, the uncontrolled recombination of metal atoms during the typical high-temperature synthesis process in M-Nx causes deterioration of CO2RR activity. Herein, by using electrospinning, we propose a novel strategy for constructing a highly active and selective SA Fe-modified N-doped porous carbon fiber membrane catalyst (Fe-N-CF). This carbon membrane has an interconnected three-dimensional structure and a hierarchical porous structure, which can not only confine Fe to be single atom as active centers, but also provide a diffusion channel for CO2 molecules. Relying on its special structure and stable mechanical properties, Fe-N-CF is directly used for CO2RR, which presents an excellent selectivity (CO Faradaic efficiency of 97%) and stability. DFT calculations reveals that the synthesized Fe-N4-C can significantly reduce the energy barrier for intermediate COOH* formation and CO desorption. This work highlights the specific advantages of using electrospinning method to prepare the optimal SA catalysts.</description>

                A method for the synthesis of &#947;&#8208;amino sulfones through visible light&#8208;induced oxidative decarboxylation and radical reductive addition is described. Various readily available N&#8208;protected natural amino acids react with aromatic/aliphatic vinyl sulfones to directly produce &#947;&#8208;amino sulfone derivatives. This reaction is also applicable to &#945;&#8208;N(O)&#8208;acids and other aliphatic carboxylic acids, resulting in the corresponding sulfone derivatives. The method operates without the need for sacrificial reducing agents or additional hydrogen atom donors. The sole by&#8208;product is CO2 released from decarboxylation, rendering the process both atom&#8208; and step&#8208;economical.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Ecological Footprint of Argan (Argania spinosa) Derivatives: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Carbon Impact of Argan Oil</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142636</link>

                Argania spinosa, commonly known as the Argan tree, assumes a crucial role in bolstering environmental sustainability by augmenting carbon storage in both biomass and soil. Despite its significant environmental contributions, there exists a conspicuous gap in scientific research and data pertaining to the carbon dynamics associated with Moroccan Argan forest ecosystems and their prized products, particularly Argan oil. To address this research gap, our study meticulously investigates the intricate details of the carbon footprint linked to Argan oil production within the "Argan Biosphere Reserve" in southern Morocco. This innovative research aims to deliver a comprehensive assessment of the carbon footprint within the Argan oil industry, conducting a thorough examination of 10 companies and 16 cooperatives actively involved in production. The foundation of this investigation rests on on-site interviews with leaders of production units, systematically gathering essential data for rigorous analysis. Employing the "Bilan Carbone" tool, we intricately calculated emissions, categorizing them into three scopes. The resulting carbon footprint outcomes were meticulously delineated across three distinct scenarios, shedding light on the nuanced dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions. In the first scenario, encompassing all scopes, including export-related emissions, companies displayed an average carbon footprint of approximately 10.17 kg CO2 eq.l-1, while cooperatives recorded 8.68 kg CO2 eq.l-1. The second scenario, excluding export-related emissions, unveiled companies with an average carbon footprint of 3.71 kg CO2-eq.l-1 and cooperatives with 6.32 kg CO2-eq.l-1. The third Scenario, concentrating solely on scopes 1 and 2, indicated companies with an average estimated carbon footprint of 1.31 kg CO2 eq.l-1, and cooperatives with approximately 3.01 kg CO2 eq.l-1. Delving deeper into the intricacies of emissions by scenario and oil-producing organizations, our findings underscore the substantial impact of electricity consumption on the overall carbon footprint of Argan oil. For companies, electricity consumption contributed between 10.84% (first scenario) and 66.97% (third scenario), while for cooperatives, the range was 26.97% (first scenario) to 75.57% (third scenario). To optimize the carbon footprint, our study recommends strategic interventions such as reducing electricity and butane consumption. Moreover, adopting sustainable practices, including leveraging photovoltaic electricity and synthetic gas from the pyrolysis of Argan byproducts, can significantly curtail the average carbon footprint of companies and cooperatives, charting a trajectory toward environmental sustainability. Specifically, a reduction of 37.05% and 40.75% (second scenario) and an impressive 71.66% and 77.01% (third scenario) for companies and cooperatives, respectively, could be achieved after a 30-year amortization period of photovoltaic panels. These findings not only contribute valuable insights into the environmental impact of Argan oil production but also pave the way for future in-depth studies and the formulation of sustainable pathways to optimize the carbon footprint of this critical industry.</description>

                Ground heat is a renewable energy source that is less affected by atmospheric temperature and maintains a nearly constant temperature throughout the year. Therefore, it can serve as a heat source for hot water and air conditioning systems, resulting in a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to conventional systems. In Japan, the recognition of the use of ground heat is still low, and the prices of ground heat exchangers and geothermal heat pumps tend to be high. In addition, the excavation cost is very high, so it is very important to reduce the construction cost. One cost-saving method is to install a ground heat exchanger in the core material of the earth retaining wall, which has been shown to reduce construction costs by more than 50%. In this study, a numerical program was developed to clarify the performance and characteristics of a ground heat exchanger attached to an H-beam in a "Pre-installation method using the earth retaining wall". Then, the factors influencing the heat extraction performance of two U-Tube heat exchangers connected in series, four U-Tube heat exchangers connected in series and two W-Tube heat exchangers connected in series were investigated. Firstly, the validity of the calculation program was confirmed by comparing the numerical results with the experimental thermal response results. Secondly, numerical simulations were performed using the calculation program, and the following results were obtained. Under the conditions defined in this study, we found that the rate of heat extraction increases as the flow rate of the heat extraction medium increases in all ground heat exchangers. However, it becomes difficult to increase the heat extraction when the flow of the heat extraction medium reaches a turbulent area. All three models confirmed that the H-beam expanded the area where the formation temperature changes and increased the temperature of the heat extraction medium. This led to an enhanced heat extraction performance of the ground heat exchanger. Finally, we compared the heat extraction performance of several ground heat exchangers using the 'coefficient of heat extraction or rejection'. The results showed that the four U-Tube model had the highest performance, followed by the two W-Tube model, and the two U-Tube model had the lowest performance, although the differences were small.</description>

      <title>Influence of Fuel Hydrogen Content and Atomisation Quality on Ultrafine Non-volatile Particulate Matter Emissions in RQL Gas Turbine Technology</title>

                Aircraft engines are a source of harmful non-volatile Particulate Matter (nvPM) emissions, negatively affecting human health and the global environment. To mitigate this, new sources of fuel are being assessed for the commercial aviation sector. Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) show significant promise as replacements to conventional aviation fuels, with the potential to reduce lifecycle CO2 and nvPM emissions because of lower aromatic contents and higher hydrogen content. Towards better understanding of the nvPM emissions from aircraft combustors operating with SAF, this work outlines results from the RAPTOR experimental test campaigns performed at Cardiff University&#8217;s Gas Turbine Research Centre (GTRC). Several aviation fuels of varying physiochemical properties were burned in a non-proprietary Rich-Quench-Lean (RQL) combustor rig. The nvPM emissions were measured using the European nvPM reference system, with data corrected for particle loss in the sampling and measurement system using additional particle size measurement. nvPM emission reductions were achieved for fuels of higher hydrogen content, and system loss correction was required to accurately quantify those reductions. Additionally, independent control of the air supply to the combustor rig allowed the impact of fuel spray quality to be decoupled from AFR, demonstrating that small improvements in spray droplet atomisation predicted from benchmarking fuel spray experiments (~5% reduction in SMD) consistently yielded significant reductions in nvPM emissions, ranging from 5-72% for nvPM EImass, 11-89% for nvPM EInumber, and 1-7% for GMD.</description>

                Increasing energy efficiency will be crucial to achieving the climate goals laid out in European Uniondirectives. This is particularly true for industries whose share of heat and energy consumption,with Poland as an example, is about one-third of the total. This challenge entails implicationsboth for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2, and for maintaining thecompetitiveness of EU industry on the global market. This article presents the basic principlesand application of an Energy Management System &#8211; EMS &#8211; in industrial processes, together withthe monitoring of Key Energy Performance Indicators &#8211; KPIs &#8211; as a tool for making informedinvestment decisions to improve the energy efficiency of companies and industrial processes.

                Portland cement is widely used in the construction industry. Its production contributes to carbon dioxide emissions, urging the need for sustainable alternatives. The present study aims to evaluate the strength, durability, microstructural properties, and cost-effectivity of geopolymer (GP) concrete containing polyethylene (PE) fibers, with fly ash (FA), ground-granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), and calcium magnesium carbonate (CaMg(CO3)2 known as dolomite) as binders. PE fiber used has an ultra-high molecular weight. Six different mixtures were produced with FA, GGBFS, dolomite, and/or PE fiber. The control mix used only FA as a binder without PE fiber. Fresh and mechanical properties, including slump value, compressive strength, and split tensile strength, were determined, and non-destructive tests, such as electrical resistivity and ultrasonic pulse velocity, were conducted. The durability of GP was evaluated through initial surface absorption and capillary suction absorption tests at different curing ages. Microstructural and mineralogical characteristics were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results revealed that the addition of PE fibers and CaMg(CO3)2 reduced the workability of GP by 30.22% in comparison with that of PE fiber along with GGBFS. Compared to the reference mix at 28 days, incorporating 20% GGBFS resulted in the highest improvement of 76.89% and 104.86% in compressive and split tensile strength, respectively. GP sample with 20% GGBFS replacement of FA presented the highest reduction of 44.4&#8211;41.63% for initial and secondary rate of absorption. SEM analysis showed that the addition of GGBFS and CaMg(CO3)2 to fiber-reinforced FA-based geopolymer mixes developed a denser and more homogenous matrix with improved mechanical behavior due to the co-existence of C&#8722;S&#8722;H and aluminosilicate gel. PE fibers improve the toughness properties by helping to absorb energy and bridging cracks. The development of a stronger matrix was characterized by C&#8722;S&#8722;H, calcium aluminate oxide (carbonate) hydroxide (C4AHx) and quartz. A one-way ANOVA analysis and cost analysis demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of partially replacing FA with CaMg(CO3)2 and GGBFS in PE fiber-reinforced GP concrete.</description>

      <title>Growth of Well-Defined Model Catalysts for Electrochemistry: From Surface Science Studies to Electrocatalytic CO2 Conversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2172/2349053</link>
      <description>Xingyi Deng, Dominic Alfonso, Dan C. Sorescu, Douglas R. Kauffman, Trang N. T. Phan, Junseok Lee, Christopher Matranga, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396936445

                We combined ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) surface science techniques, electrochemical measurements, and computational modeling to investigate electrocatalytic systems that are crucial components of the carbon management effort, including oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). Well-defined Model catalysts were grown on substrates in the UHV chamber and characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Selected model electrocatalysts were then tested in electrochemical cells to establish the structure-property relationships in OER and CO2RR. Our results showed that the edge sites of Fe2O3 grown on Au(111) were the most active toward OER and incorporation of Ni at the edge sites (NiFeOx) further boosted their OER activity. We also resolved the size-dependent electrocatalytic CO2-to-CO conversion of the Ag nanoparticle electrocatalysts with average particle diameter between 2 to 6 nm: smaller diameter (&lt; 3 nm) particles favored H2 evolution reaction (HER) due to a high population of Ag edge sites, whereas larger diameter particles favored CO2RR as the population of Ag(100) surface sites grew. We further discovered that electronic interactions between small diameter Ag particles and highly defective carbon supports could break the size-dependent CO2RR selectivity, resulting in highly selective (CO Faradaic Efficiency &gt; 90%) and active Ag nanoparticle electrocatalysts with sizes &lt; 2 nm diameter.</description>

      <description>Yan Cao, Yu Bai, Jiang Du, Biofuels. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398137984

                The main objective of the present study was to compare the catalytic activity of selected limestones (G&#246;yn&#252;k, Dikmen, Polatl&#305; Yolu, K&#305;n&#305;k T&#252;neli and K&#246;serelik) in terms of H2-rich syngas production from biomass gasification. In order to achieve this goal, an ASPEN plus-based model for biomass gasification integrated with carbonation reaction was developed. Tar formation was also considered and the gasification process was carried out based on Gibbs free energy minimization. A combined effect of temperature (600-710 &#176;C), steam/biomass ratio, S/B (0.58-1.58), and limestone/biomass ratio, L/B (0-2.0) on gas composition, H2 yield (HY) and gas yield (GY) was also studied. An increase in both S/B and L/B was beneficial for H2 enrichment. The CO2 content declined sharply from 16.83 vol% to 10.28 vol% with increasing L/B from 0 to 1.5; however, a marginal reduction in CO2 content was observed with further increase in L/B. The highest HY (51.01 g/kg) was produced with Dikmen followed by G&#246;yn&#252;k, Polatl&#305; Yolu, K&#305;n&#305;k T&#252;neli and K&#246;serelik. The results also showed that the limestone samples with high CaO content in general exhibits a better H2 production capacity than limestones with low CaO content. To the best of our knowledge, no simulation study has been presented to compare the catalytic activity of different limestones in terms of H2 production.</description>

                The circular economy has come with momentum to settle in the countries as a new model of economic growth. Thus, sustainable development and the objectives set forth by the United Nations for its achievement and expansion highlight the concern and preoccupation of society for these issues. For this reason, this chapter deals with four specific aspects of the agricultural industry sector, which aim to improve our lives and the sustainability of our planet. These aspects refer to the use of biomass residues and their contribution to the food sector, the generation of biofuel and electricity from biogas for agricultural use, as well as the reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation. Finally, a decrease in cotton production and the use of regenerated cotton by the textile industry will be considered. Based on the theoretical framework, four specific proposals are established to achieve the aggregate global growth requirement posed by Sustainable Development Goal 8, compared to the reduction in the use of CO2, together with the reduction in the use of resources (Goals 6, 7, 9, 12 and 15). These proposals cover aspects such as the reuse of organic and biodegradable wastes, the reuse of water through different irrigation methods and its application based on its components, and the reuse of cotton from existing clothing. All of this provides economic agents, administration, companies, and households with opportunities for reflection and implementation of a more sustainable economic and social model.</description>

                This study offers an in-depth analysis and optimization of a microgrid system powered by renewable sources, designed for the efficient production of hydrogen and dimethyl ether&#8212;key elements in the transition toward sustainable fuel alternatives. The system architecture incorporates solar photovoltaic modules, advanced battery storage solutions, and electrolytic hydrogen production units, with a targeted reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the enhancement of overall energy efficiency. A rigorous economic analysis was conducted utilizing the HYSYS V12 software platform and encompassing capital and operational expenditures alongside profit projections to evaluate the system&#8217;s economic viability. Furthermore, thermal optimization was achieved through heat integration strategies, employing a cascade analysis methodology and optimization via the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS), yielding an 83% decrease in annual utility expenditures. Comparative analysis revealed that the energy requirement of the optimized system was over 50% lower than that of traditional fossil fuel-based reforming processes. A comprehensive assessment of CO2 emissions demonstrated a significant reduction, with the integration of thermal management solutions facilitating a 99.24% decrease in emissions. The outcomes of this study provide critical insights into the engineering of sustainable, low-carbon energy systems, emphasizing the role of renewable energy technologies in advancing fuel science.</description>

      <title>Review on Mercury Control during Co-Firing Coal and Biomass under O2/CO2 Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app14104209</link>
      <description>Qiang Lyu, Fei Xin, Applied sciences. 14(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396964526

                Combining biomass co-firing with oxy-fuel combustion is a promising Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technology. It has the potential to achieve a large-scale reduction in carbon emissions from traditional power plants, making it a powerful tool for addressing global climate change. However, mercury in the fuel can be released into the flue gas during combustion, posing a significant threat to the environment and human health. More importantly, mercury can also cause the fracture of metal equipment via amalgamation, which is a major risk for the system. Therefore, compared to conventional coal-fired power plants, the requirements for the mercury concentration in BECCS systems are much stricter. This article reviews the latest progress in mercury control under oxy-fuel biomass co-firing conditions, clarifies the impact of biomass co-firing on mercury species transformation, reveals the influence mechanisms of various flue gas components on elemental mercury oxidation under oxy-fuel combustion conditions, evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of various mercury removal methods, and finally provides an outlook for mercury control in BECCS systems. Research shows that after biomass co-firing, the concentrations of chlorine and alkali metals in the flue gas increase, which is beneficial for homogeneous and heterogeneous mercury oxidation. The changes in the particulate matter content could affect the transformation of gaseous mercury to particulate mercury. The high concentrations of CO2 and H2O in oxy-fuel flue gas inhibit mercury oxidation, while the effects of NOx and SO2 are dual-sided. Higher concentrations of fly ash in oxy-fuel flue gas are conducive to the removal of Hg0. Additionally, under oxy-fuel conditions, CO2 and metal ions such as Fe2+ can inhibit the re-emission of mercury in WFGD systems. The development of efficient adsorbents and catalysts is the key to achieving deep mercury removal. Fully utilizing the advantages of chlorine, alkali metals, and CO2 in oxy-fuel biomass co-firing flue gas will be the future focus of deep mercury removal from BECCS systems.</description>

      <title>Production of concrete pavements using mixed cements</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.14311/app.2024.47.0066</link>
      <description>Jan Klob&#225;sa, Rudolf Hela, Acta Polytechnica CTU Proceedings. 47(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398171780

                Currently, great importance is attached to the reduction of emissions in industrial production, especially in the production of cement, when it is indicated that during production 1 ton of cement produces approximately 0.6 ton of CO2. Reducing emissions is possible thanks to secondary raw materials, which are produced in large quantities in the Czech Republic volumes for which a suitable use is sought. Some secondary raw materials are suitable for use in concrete mixes, which are used to improve the rheology of the fresh concrete mixture as well as the properties hardened concrete. Currently, there is an effort to eliminate the production of cement, to which its partial replacement by admixtures could also contribute. Therefore it is necessary determine the optimal admixture that could be used to replace part of the cement in concrete mix. A large consumer of concrete mixes are transport structures, where it is possible for some of the cement used to be replaced by an admixture.</description>

      <title>Effects of steam feeding on microwave heating of cellulose with magnetite used as susceptor</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.261</link>

                Microwave heating (MWH) of lignocellulosic biomass with susceptors has attracted attention for H2 production. In this study, H2 is produced from cellulose via MWH at 800 &#176;C in a steam atmosphere with magnetite used as the susceptor. The effects of steam feeding and MWH on the product yields are experimentally investigated in comparison with conventional heating (CH). The H2 and CO2 yields are increased by steam feeding for both MWH and CH because the water&#8211;gas shift reaction occurs. Without steam feeding, MWH enhances H2 and CO production, thereby increasing the maximum energy efficiency. With steam feeding, the steam gasification of C is more predominant for CH than for MWH as the reduction in the C content in the char of CH is higher than that of MWH. MWH reduces the formation of secondary char, and it is therefore expected to overcome issues such as the clogging or blockage of gas lines.</description>

                The goal of increasing fuel efficiency and decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has increased interest in the application of renewable energy sources and the usage of new technologies in the maritime industry. In order to implement the most suitable source, factors such as voyage duration, storage availability, and the condition of existing vessels as well as those that are still under construction should be taken into account. Propeller optimization is proposed as a long-term solution. This paper investigates the environmental aspects of propeller optimization, focusing on its potential to reduce ship vibrations fuel consumption, and, therefore, the ship&#8217;s carbon footprint. The case study presents propeller optimization on a Ro-Ro passenger ship. The data collected during sea trials before and after propeller optimization will be compared. Expected fuel oil consumption will be correlated to the CO2 emission reduction. Besides propeller optimization, the paper performs a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis comparing it with solar and wind power applications on ships.</description>

      <title>Carbon Emission Measurement Method of Regional Power System Based on LSTM-Attention Model</title>

                With the acceleration of the green and low-carbon transformation of the power system, it is very important to calculate and analyze the carbon emissions of the urban power system. In order to effectively grasp the carbon emission distribution of power system and reduce the carbon emission of power system, this paper proposes a systematic carbon emission measurement method for regional power system. Firstly, the quantitative analysis model of driving factors for regional power system carbon emissions is constructed, and the direction and measures of low-carbon transformation and green collaborative development of regional power system are proposed. Secondly, energy consumption scenarios under different constraints are established to support the collaborative control path of CO2. It provides key data and a theoretical basis for the low-carbon development of the power industry. Finally, a systematic carbon emission measurement method based on LSTM-Attention is proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by an example analysis, and the effective path of carbon emission reduction in the future is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Hyperoxia and regional cerebral blood flow: Do brain regions respond differently to high-oxygen gas?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1152/physiol.2024.39.s1.454</link>
      <description>Thomas J. Haley, Jessica Muer, Kaylin D. Didier, Brett Wannebo, Sophie Sanchez, Oliver Wieben, Marlowe W. Eldridge, Physiology. 39(S1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398166454

                Background: Delivery of oxygen-rich gas (hyperoxia) is used to treat medical emergencies as well as to prevent adverse outcomes in certain occupations that are subjected to extreme environmental conditions. While useful for mitigating acute health risks, hyperoxia has been linked to health decrements including systemic vasoconstriction, increased oxidative stress, worsened neurological outcomes, and increased mortality. Notably, hyperoxia has been found to decrease global cerebral blood flow (CBF) in humans by as much as 37%. Reductions in CBF are associated with increased risk of stroke and cognitive impairment- both of which present heterogeneously. To our knowledge, only one study has explored hyperoxia&#8217;s effect on regional CBF and there appeared to be a differential response between regions, but no between-region analysis was performed. If a differential response between regions can be identified, these regions could be monitored more closely for signs of dysfunction or dysregulation. We hypothesized that brain lobes and regions will exhibit a non-uniform reduction in CBF when given 100% oxygen (O 2 ). Methods: Healthy, young adults (n= 15; 7 F; 22 &#177; 4 yr; BMI: 22 &#177; 2) were studied after an 8-hour fast and 24-hour abstinence from caffeine, exercise, or alcohol. Women were studied on days 1-5 of their menstrual cycle and not taking any hormonal contraception. Subjects completed a single magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, 3 Tesla) visit. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI quantified microvascular CBF in six lobes and their 71 subregions during normoxia and again after ~10 min steady-state hyperoxia. Hyperoxia was achieved by breathing 100% O 2 with supplemental carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) to maintain end-tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2 ). The CAT12 toolbox extension for Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) was used to process ASL data. CBF (mL/100g/min) was analyzed as absolute change (&#916;), and relative change (%&#916;). Two-factor and one-factor repeated measures ANOVA were performed to detect significant main effects and region-condition interactions. A Tukey test was used for post-hoc analysis and pairwise comparisons. Significance was set to P&#8804;0.05. Results: Results are mean &#177; SD. Heart rate (HR) and ETCO 2 remained similar from normoxia to hyperoxia, but mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased by 5 &#177; 6 mmHg ( P=0.013). Hyperoxia reduced CBF in all anatomical lobes (Occipital; Parietal; Frontal; Temporal; Brainstem/Cerebellum; Subcortical [ P&#8804;0.001]), but the relative decrease was not different between lobes ( P=0.522; range= 18 &#177; 12% to 21 &#177; 9%). When examining CBF between 71 smaller brain regions, hyperoxia reduced blood flow in all regions ( P&#8804;0.001; range= 15 &#177; 13% to 25 &#177; 13%); ANOVA indicated a region-specific effect ( P&#8804;0.001), however post-hoc analysis did not identify which regions displayed different levels of hypoxic vasoconstriction. Conclusion: These are the first data to systematically examine the regional effects of hyperoxia on CBF. Contrary to our hypothesis, the microvascular CBF reduction to hyperoxia appears uniform across anatomical brain lobes. However, regional analysis indicated that there may be a differential microvascular vasoconstrictor response to hyperoxia between some functional regions of the brain. Funding: NIH R01 HL150361.

      <title>Novel activation method of waste concrete powder for sustainable clinker-free binder</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconcomp.2024.105600</link>
      <description>Aidarus Yonis, Yanchen Oinam, Prabhat Vashistha, Aron Berhanu Degefa, Geta Bekalu Belayneh, Solmoi Park, Sukhoon Pyo, Cement &amp; concrete composites. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398185288

                This study investigates the environmental and mechanical implications of incorporating silica fume into lime-activated thermo-mechanically treated waste concrete powder (TMWCP) to develop a sustainable clinker-free binder. The novel activation method involves thermo-mechanical treatment of WCP, followed by lime and calcium formate chemical activation. The results demonstrated that incorporating silica fume enhanced the pozzolanic reactivity, which led to the formation of C-S-H, pore refinement, and a dramatic increase in compressive strength. For instance, the incorporation of 20% and 25% silica fume exhibited compressive strength of 46 MPa and 43 MPa after 28 days of curing. The developed clinker-free binder with the addition of 20% silica fume demonstrated a reduction in mineral resource consumption of 99.3% and CO2 emissions of 13% and 69.3% compared to the sample without silica fume and ordinary Portland cement, respectively. This study offers a promising avenue for the widespread utilization of WCP as an environmentally friendly clinker-free binder.</description>

                The importance and breadth of applications of the family of quaternary chalcogenides with the formula Cu2ZnSnSxSe(4&#8722;x) (CZTS/Se) where x = 0&#8211;4 are steadily expanding due to the tunable optoelectronic properties of these compounds and the Earth abundance of the elements in their composition. These p-type semiconductors are viewed as a viable alternative to Si, gallium arsenide, CdTe, and CIGS solar cells due to their cost effectiveness, Earth&#8217;s crust abundance, and non-toxic elements. Additionally, CZTS/Se compounds have demonstrated notable capabilities beyond solar cells, such as photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction, solar water splitting, solar seawater desalination, hydrogen production, and use as an antibacterial agent. Various routes have been explored for synthesizing pure CZTS/Se nanomaterials and significant efforts have been dedicated to reducing the occurrence of secondary phases. This review focuses on synthetic approaches for CZTS/Se nanomaterials, with emphasis on controlling the size and morphology of the nanoparticles and their recent application in solar energy harvesting and beyond, highlighting challenges in achieving the desired purity required in all these applications.</description>

      <title>Driving a Deficient Cathodic Environment Using Anode to Control Selectivity for Co2 Electroreduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4829136</link>
      <description>D. S. Kim, Man Ho Han, Jae Yong Park, Hyunchul Kim, Hyeon&#8208;Seok Bang, Seungho Yu, Jae&#8208;Young Choi, Hyung&#8208;Suk Oh, Woong Hee Lee, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396941721

                The anode has not been extensively studied in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) systems because it is believed to have no significant effect on the catalytic selectivity and activity of the cathode. Herein, we report that the anode can indeed influence the catalytic activity of the CO2RR by regulating the transfer of water and ions in a membrane electrode assembly. Despite employing identical cathode conditions, we observed optimal ethylene production at different current densities for distinct anode substrates: carbon paper (CP) and Ti meshes. Based on the results of in situ/operando analysis and transparent cell tests, CP creates an environment deficient in water and cations, thereby promoting local pH effects. Consequently, this leads to a higher valence state of Cu during the CO2RR, resulting in increased catalytic activity for ethylene production. However, in the high-current-density region, the catalytic activity of CP degrades due to the uneven distribution of the reaction. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the reaction environment for CO2RR and offers insights for optimizing the catalytic activity of CO2RR systems.</description>

                In this work, La(FeCuMnMgTi)O3 HEO nanoparticles with a perovskite-type structure are synthesized and used in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The catalyst demonstrates high performance as an electrocatalyst for the CO2RR, with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.5% at a current density of 21.9 mA cm&#8211;2 under &#8722;0.75 V vs a saturated calomel electrode (SCE). Particularly, an FE above 54% is obtained for methyl isopropyl ketone (C5H10O, MIPK) at a partial current density of 16 mA cm&#8211;2, overcoming all previous works. Besides, the as-prepared HEO catalyst displays robust stability in the CO2RR. The excellent catalytic performance of La(FeCuMnMgTi)O3 is ascribed to the synergistic effect between the electronic effects associated with five cations occupying the high-entropy sublattice sites and the oxygen vacancies within the perovskite structure of the HEO. Finally, DFT calculations indicate that Cu plays a vital role in the catalytic activity of the La(FeCuMnMgTi)O3 HEO nanoparticles toward C2+ products.</description>

      <title>Fire Behaviour of Biochar-based Cementitious Composites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomc.2024.100471</link>
      <description>Rhoda Afriyie Mensah, Dong Wang, S. Vigneshwaran, Gabriel Sas, Michael F&#246;rsth, Oisik Das, Composites. Part C, Open access. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398146950

                The study aimed to test the hypothesis that biochar's unique properties, such as its microporous structure, enhance concrete's resilience to high temperatures. Despite expectations of reduced crack formation and enhanced fire resistance, the experimental results revealed limited impact on concrete's fire behaviour. The investigation involved the use of two biochar types, fine and coarse biochar as replacements for cement and aggregates, respectively. Fine biochar exhibited higher water absorption and Young's modulus than coarse biochar, but both resisted ignition at 35 kW/m2 and had peak heat release rates below 40 kW/m2. Incorporating these biochars at varying weight percentages (5, 10, and 20 wt.%) into concrete led to a gradual decline in compressive and tensile strength due to reduced binding ability with increased biochar content. Exposure to 1000 &#176;C compromised mechanical properties across all the samples. However, the biochar concrete maintained standard compressive strength (compared to the control) with up to 20 wt.% biochar as a fine aggregate substitute after exposure to 600&#176;C, and as a cement replacement after exposure to 200&#176;C. This substitution also yielded a significant reduction in CO2 emissions (50 % reduction as the biochar loading amount doubled) from concrete manufacturing, showcasing biochar's potential for sustainable construction practices. Despite not fully supporting the initial hypothesis, the study demonstrated biochar's viability in reducing carbon footprint while maintaining concrete strength under certain fire conditions.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Dynamics: Evaluating the Relationship Between Ship Emissions and Socioeconomic Progress in the Yangtze River Basin from 2007 to 2022</title>

                To investigate the decoupling relationship between inland ship emissions and regional socioeconomic development in the Yangtze River Basin, this study constructed an emissions inventory for inland ships from 2007 to 2022, based on inland shipping freight statistics and ship carbon pollution emission intensity. Additionally, the Petri-Tapio decoupling model was employed to analyze the relationship between ship carbon pollution emissions and per capita GDP. The study concluded that CO2 emissions from inland ships in the Yangtze River Basin increased from 2.418 million tons in 2007 to 10.801 million tons in 2022. In 2021, the emissions of NOx and SOx from inland ships in the Yangtze River Basin accounted for 2.27% and 0.0021%, respectively, of China's anthropogenic emissions. Despite a year-on-year increasing trend in ship emissions within the basin, significant reductions in PM and SO2 emissions were observed post-2018 due to the implementation of emission reduction policies. Furthermore, we found that economically developed areas such as Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang had higher emissions compared to other regions, with regional ship emissions positively correlating with the level of economic activity. Decoupling analysis results indicated that most provinces in the Yangtze River Basin have not effectively decoupled ship carbon pollution emissions from GDP growth. The findings of this study provide support for the Chinese government to formulate stricter ship emission control policies while promoting the growth of the Yangtze River shipping economy.</description>

      <title>Self-Consolidating Paste Systems using Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag and Limestone Powder mineral admixtures</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cscm.2024.e03316</link>
      <description>Muhammad Naveed Aslam Metla, Muhammad Amin, Syed Rizwan, Kaffayatullah Khan, Case studies in construction materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398147837

                This study aims to investigate the blends of supplementary cementitious ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) with limestone powder (LSP) as mineral admixtures to partially replace cement (up to 30%) in self-consolidating paste (SCP) systems made at respective water demands. Besides the control formulation (100% cement), the first set of SCP systems includes GGBFS alone as a partial substitute of cement (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%), whereas the second set contains blends of 10% GGBFS with 10% and 20% LSP. For all the seven formulations (1 control, 4 binary and 2 ternary), tests were performed to determine their water demand, setting times and flow behavior, hydration kinetics, mechanical strengths and microstructural properties. Results showed that the fresh and hardened state properties of SCP systems incorporating GGBFS and LSP led to an increase in strength, hydration kinetics were slightly improved and hence enhancement of strength and microstructure of SCP systems. Reduction in initial and final setting times recorded with increased LSP from 10% to 20% in ternary SCP formulations. Early compressive strength due to LSP increased in ternary SCP systems as compared to binary formulations, which reflected synergy between GGBFS and LSP in SCP systems. Moreover, environmental assessment results indicate a significant reduction in CO2 emissions by substituting cement with GGBFS and LSP. These findings indicate that both GGBFS and LSP can be successfully used in developing high performance and environment friendly self-compacting concrete (SCC).</description>

      <title>Breathing 5% carbon dioxide for 1 minute increases cerebral blood flow during lower body negative pressure</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1152/physiol.2024.39.s1.810</link>
      <description>John W. Harrell, Rachel Beri, Lail Edelsztein, Andrew K Muriithi, Ross D. Pollock, Physiology. 39(S1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398167645

                Objective: Lower body negative pressure (LBNP) is an established surrogate of hypergravity to investigate responses to central hypovolemia, including the reduction in cerebral blood flow. Increased inspired carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) causes cerebrovascular dilation and increases cerebral blood flow. We aimed to determine whether breathing 5% CO 2 for 1 minute increased cerebral blood flow during LBNP. We hypothesized 5% inspired CO 2 would increase cerebral blood flow during LBNP. Methods: We collected data from 15 (9 M/6 F, 31&#177;8 yr, 25.6&#177;3.2 kg/m 2 ) healthy individuals. Subjects breathed room air or a mix of 5% CO 2 , 21% oxygen, balance nitrogen gas for 1 minute prior to initiation of 2 minutes of -60 mmHg LBNP and throughout the duration of LBNP. We allowed a 2-minute wash-out between trials. We measured middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv) with transcranial Doppler ultrasound and continuous, non-invasive blood pressure (MAP) with a finger plethysmograph. We corrected MCAv for MAP and present it as cerebrovascular conductance index (CVCi). We also measure ventilation and gas exchange with a pneumotachometer and gas analyzer. Results: All measured variables were similar prior to the initiation of room air and 5% CO 2 prebreathe ( p &gt; 0.05). Inspired (1&#177;1 vs. 36&#177;1 mmHg) and end-tidal (38&#177;4 vs. 47&#177;3 mmHg) CO 2 were greater during the 5% inspired CO 2 trial ( p &lt; 0.05, main effect of gas). LBNP caused an increase in heart rate, decrease in stroke volume, decrease in cardiac output, and an increase in total peripheral resistance ( p &lt; 0.05, main effect of LBNP). These variables were similar regardless of inspiratory gas. MCAv (40&#177;16 vs. 53&#177;19 cm/s), MAP (94&#177;10 vs. 99&#177;11 mmHg), and CVCi (0.46&#177;0.22 vs 0.56&#177;0.24 cm/s/mmHg) were all greater during the 5% inspired CO 2 trials ( p &lt; 0.05, main effect of gas). Discussion: Breathing a mixture of 5% CO 2 for 1 minute increased cerebral blood flow and blood pressure during a mimic of hypergravity stress. Despite technical challenges of integration into high-performance aircraft, increasing inspired CO 2 could contribute to better tolerance to hypergravity stress.

      <title>Influence of Hf Doping on the Oxygen Behaviors on ZrCo(110) Surface Using First-Principles Calculation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17102424</link>

                ZrCo alloy is easily poisoned by impurity gases such as O2, CO, and CO2, resulting in a deterioration in hydrogen storage performance. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the adsorption and dissociation characteristics of oxygen on the ZrCo(110) surface using first-principles calculations. Previous studies indicated that the anti-disproportionation properties of ZrCo alloy can be significantly improved by Hf substitution, but the effect of Hf doping on the anti-poisoning properties has not been reported. We also examined the effect of Hf doping on the adsorption, dissociation, and diffusion characteristics of oxygen. It is found that on the ZrCo(110) surface, O2 molecules are easily dissociated and then stably adsorbed at the hollow site. Oxygen atoms will fill the surface preferentially and then diffuse inward. The doping of Hf has an insignificant impact on the adsorption or dissociation behavior of oxygen in comparison to the pure ZrCo surface. However, a notable observation is that the doping of Hf resulted in a reduction in the diffusion barrier for oxygen from the surface to the subsurface by 0.61 eV. Consequently, our study suggests that doping Hf is not an advisable strategy for improving the ZrCo(110) surface&#8217;s resistance to O2 poisoning because of improved oxygen permeability.</description>

      <title>Single-Atom Pd Catalyst on a CeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (111) Surface for Methane Oxidation: Activation Barriers and Reaction Pathways</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c00179</link>
      <description>Shalini Tomar, Bhagirath Singh Bhadoria, Hojin Jeong, Jin Hwa Choi, Seung Cheol Lee, Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Journal of physical chemistry. C./Journal of physical chemistry. C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398142427

                Employing density functional theory, we delved into the comprehensive pathways for methane oxidation on the Pd single atom supported with CeO2(111) encompassing sequential methane dehydrogenation, O2 dissociation, and oxidation processes. The introduction of a Pd atom into CeO2(111) led to a reduction in the barrier for CH4 dissociation to 0.50 eV. The methane dehydrogenation proceeded through a series of reactions: CH4 &#8594; CH3 &#8594; CH2 &#8594; CH &#8594; C, with all dehydrogenation steps being exothermic except the CH3 &#8594; CH2 step. The O2 dissociation reaction (O2 &#8594; O* + O*) is thermodynamically exothermic, with a dissociation barrier of 2.12 eV over Pd@CeO2. Subsequently, the generation of CO2 via the C* + O* and CO* + O* reactions is characterized by thermodynamically exothermic processes, with reaction energies of &#8722;1.20 and &#8722;1.01 eV, respectively. On the other hand, water production occurs through O* + H (an exothermic reaction) and OH* + H (an endothermic reaction) with reaction energies of &#8722;0.80 and +0.64 eV, respectively. These findings offer valuable insights into the potential pathways for single-atom catalysis involving transition metals supported on CeO2(111) in methane oxidation for industrial application.</description>

      <title>Effect of Ionomer Content and Ag/C Catalyst Surface Area on the Performance of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electrolysis to CO</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaenm.4c00192</link>

                Carbon-supported silver catalysts have proven high activity and durability in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CO. This work investigates the impact of cathode catalyst layer composition on performance by varying the ionomer content and Ag/C catalysts with differing BET surface areas (33&#8211;455 m2 g&#8211;1). For optimal performance, there is a positive correlation between optimal ionomer binder content and catalyst surface area: 5 wt % PiperION for Ag/CSuper P, 15 wt % PiperION for Ag/CVulcan, and 25 wt % PiperION for Ag/CKetjen. The top-performing cells exhibited remarkably high CO faradaic efficiencies of 93% for 15 wt % Ag/CVulcan, 91% for 5 wt % Piperion Ag/CSuper P, and 90% for 25 wt % Piperion Ag/CKetjen (all at 400 mA cm&#8211;2 with 0.01 M CsOH as anolyte). Long-term measurements at 300 mA cm&#8211;2 over 100 h revealed the lowest FECO loss for Ag/CVulcan, decreasing from 93 to 87%, followed by Ag/CSuper P (91&#8211;79%) and Ag/CKetjen (90&#8211;63%).</description>

      <title>Hybridization State Transition under Working Conditions: Activity Origin of Single-Atom Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c05630</link>
      <description>Yu Cui, Chunjin Ren, Qiang Li, Chongyi Ling, Jinlan Wang, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398169415

                Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely investigated and have emerged as a transformative approach in electrocatalysis. Despite their clear structure, the origin of their exceptional activity remains elusive. Herein, we elucidate a common phenomenon of the hybridization state transition of metal centers, which is responsible for the activity origin across various SACs for different reactions. Focusing on N-doped carbon-supported Ni SAC (NiN4 SAC) for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), our comprehensive computations successfully clarify the hybridization state transition under working conditions and its relation with the activity. This transition, triggered by the reaction intermediates and applied potential, converts the Ni center from the inert dsp2 hybridization state to the active d2sp3 hybridization state. Importantly, the calculated activity and selectivity of the CO2RR over the d2sp3-hybridized Ni center are consistent with the experimental results, offering strong support for the proposed hypothesis. This work suggests a universal principle of electronic structure evolution in SACs that could revolutionize catalyst design, which also introduces a new paradigm for manipulating electronic states to enhance catalytic performance, with implications for various reactions and catalyst platforms.</description>

      <title>The Environmental Benefits of an Automatic Idling Control System of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app14114338</link>

                The transportation sector is regarded as the main culprit in greenhouse gas emission in the urban network, particularly idling vehicles waiting at signalized intersections. Although autonomous vehicles can be a promising technology to tackle vehicle idling, their environmental benefits receive little attention compared with their safety and mobility issues. This study investigated the environmental benefits of autonomous vehicles equipped with an automatic idling control function based on the queue discharge time and traffic signal information transmitted from the traffic signal controller via V2I communication using microscopic mobility and emission simulation models, VISSIM and MOVES, in Haeundae-gu in Busan, Korea. This study found that the function contributes to a significant reduction in CO2 emissions by 23.6% for all-inclusive emission and 94.3% for idling emission, respectively. Moreover, total reduced idling time accounts for 47.6% of the total travel time and 94.3% of the total idling time, respectively. Consequently, the autonomous vehicles equipped with automatic vehicle idling control function under C-ITS can play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption as well in the urban network.</description>

      <title>Engineering Ultrathin CuxS Layer on Planar Sb2S3 Photocathode to Enhance Photoelectrochemical Transformation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202407836</link>

                Sb2S3 has been extensively used as light absorber for photoelectrochemical cell. However, its p&#8208;type nature may result in the formation of Schottky junction with substrates, thus hindering the collection of photogenerated holes. Herein, an ultrathin CuxS layer is successfully engineered as the bottom junction for Sb2S3 for the first time. Capitalizing on its impressive electrical properties and superior optical properties, the CuxS layer exhibits a high work function of 4.90 eV, which causes the upward band bending of p&#8208;type Sb2S3, forming a hole&#8208;transparent structure with ohmic contact. The transparency of the ultrathin CuxS layer enables back&#8208;illumination of the Sb2S3/CuxS platform, facilitating the integration of intricate catalyst layers for photoelectrochemical transformation. When modified with Pt nanoparticles, the photocurrent density reaches &#8722;5.38 mA cm&#8722;2 at 0 V vs. RHE, marking a fourfold increase compared to the photocathode without CuxS layer. When introducing a molecular hybrid TC&#8208;CoPc@carbon black, a remarkable average photocurrent density of &#8722;0.44 mA cm&#8722;2 at the overpotential of 0 V is obtained for CO2 reduction reaction, while the photocurrent density is less than &#8722;0.03 mA cm&#8722;2 without CuxS.</description>

When introducing a molecular hybrid TC&#8208;CoPc@carbon black, a remarkable average photocurrent density of &#8722;0.44 mA cm&#8722;2 at the overpotential of 0 V is obtained for CO2 reduction reaction, while the photocurrent density is less than &#8722;0.03 mA cm&#8722;2 without CuxS.</description>

                ABSTRACT Considering groundwater from the aquifers overlying the bedrock is an important water source for drinking purposes. As such, the investigation of its property is essential. Based on the spatial structure of aquifers in the study area, the aquifers in the Cenozoic strata are divided into three groups. The multivariate statistical approaches are employed to identify the hydrogeochemical processes and hydro-chemical types, and hydrogeochemical inverse modeling is applied to further validate and elucidate the hydrogeochemical process and water&#8211;rock interaction. The results are as follows: (1) The hydro-chemical type of the upper aquifer is dominated by the K + Na-HCO3 type, while others have similar water quality types, which are dominated by the K + Na-Cl type and the K + Na-SO4 type. (2) The saturation index of anhydrite, gypsum, halite, and CO2(g) is below zero in three aquifers, indicating that they are unsaturated. While aragonite, calcite, and dolomite in the middle aquifer remain in the unsaturated&#8211;saturated state. (3) The cation exchange process accelerating the reduction of Ca2+ concentration and the increase of SO42&#8722; concentration occurs in three aquifers, and the dissolution of calcite and dolomite minerals occurs in most cases. This study supports the fundamental evidence for the hydrogeochemical processes and water resource utilization and has a certain practical significance.</description>

      <title>Hyperventilation in Patients with Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS): Effects of Tidal Volume versus Hypocapnia on Heart Rate</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1152/physiol.2024.39.s1.614</link>
      <description>Shaun Ranada, Jacquie Baker, Kavithra Karalasingham, Rashmin Hira, Anthony V. Incognito, Richard J. A. Wilson, Aaron A. Phillips, Physiology. 39(S1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398165407

                Background: Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is a chronic form of orthostatic intolerance that significantly impacts the quality of life and day-to-day functioning of patients. POTS has an estimated prevalence of about 1%, predominantly affecting females of child-bearing age. POTS is characterized by an upright increase in heart rate (HR) of &#8805;30 bpm, without a drop in blood pressure. POTS is associated with chronic (&#8805; 3 months) upright symptoms including light-headedness, blurred vision, and cognitive dysfunction. A large proportion of POTS patients also experience hyperventilation when upright. Hyperventilation reduces arterial carbon dioxide (CO 2 ; hypocapnia) and exacerbates tachycardia in POTS. Whether the HR response is due to increased tidal volume (V T ) per se or the resulting hypocapnia is unclear. Investigating the independent effects of increased V T versus hypocapnia on HR might identify possible therapeutic targets to reduce HR in patients with POTS. Objective: We aimed to characterize the separate effects of hypocapnia and V T on HR in POTS patients. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that hypocapnia and V T will independently increase HR, with hypocapnia causing the greatest increase in HR in patients with POTS. Methods: Twenty female POTS patients (32&#177;10 years) completed supine normocapnic and hypocapnic breathing tests. To assess the effects of hypocapnia on HR, we compared hypocapnic-hyperventilation versus normocapnic-hyperventilation with constant V T . To assess the effects of V T on HR, we compared increased V T breathing versus normal breathing with constant end-tidal CO 2 (ETCO 2 ). Breath-by-breath respiratory (V T , ETCO 2 ) and beat-to-beat hemodynamic parameters (stroke volume [SV], HR) were continuously measured. Data were analyzed with paired t-tests, and are reported as mean &#177; SD. Results: ETCO 2 was lower ( p&lt;0.001) with similar V T during hypocapnia compared to normocapnia. Hypocapnia reduced SV (63.3&#177;11.8 mL vs. 72.4&#177;12.3 mL; p&lt;0.001), and increased HR (99&#177;13 bpm vs. 81&#177;9 bpm; p&lt;0.001). Compared to normal breathing, increased V T ( p&lt;0.001) with constant ETCO 2 led to a smaller reduction in SV (72.4&#177;12.3 mL vs. 76.0&#177;14.3 mL; p=0.04), and increase in HR (81&#177;9 bpm vs. 75&#177;9 bpm; p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Our results suggest that hypocapnia and increased V T independently reduce SV and increase HR in POTS patients. The increase in HR was greater during hypocapnia (+18 bpm) compared to increased V T (+6 bpm). Reducing hypocapnia presents an attractive therapeutic target.

      <title>Economic evaluation of decarbonizing the electricity sector in the Dominican Republic</title>

                This paper presents an in-depth analysis of decarbonizing the electricity sector in the Dominican Republic, pivotal for addressing climate change and fostering economic growth. Employing the robust-decision making methodology, we studied multiple scenarios via computational models, capturing inputs from stakeholders and evaluating each scenario across 1,000 futures to capture deep uncertainty. Four scenarios were examined: baseline, reference, natural gas, and renewable. The renewable scenario emerged as the most advantageous, proposing the replacement of coal-fired power generation with renewable sources, primarily solar and wind, coupled with batteries. A significant investment, averaging US$3.3 billion, is necessary for this shift toward renewable energy; however, these investments are overcompensated by savings in operational costs. Crucially, this transition promises substantial benefits by 2050: an estimated cumulative average net economic gain of US$2.7 billion, an 8% reduction in average generation costs in 2050, the creation of 160,000 direct jobs, and the avoidance of circa 140 million tons of CO2. The findings underscore the feasibility and economic viability of transitioning to a 55% renewable energy generation by 2050. The study offers a critical roadmap for policymakers, highlighting renewable energy expansion, transmission grid strengthening, and strategic coal generation replacement, thus offering a comprehensive blueprint for the nation's energy transition.</description>

      <title>Corrosion Enhancement of PM Processed Magnesium by Turning Native Oxide on Mg Powders into Carbonates</title>

                In addition to its use as a lightweight material, pure magnesium is a promising candidate for prospective bioimplants considering its excellent biocompatible properties. Regardless of what Mg application is used, the ultimate goal is to improve magnesium's mechanical properties and degradation behaviour. Because of the high affinity for oxygen native oxide layer of gas-atomized powders is naturally formed in contact with the atmosphere. S/TEM investigation of the native oxide of the Mg powder particles revealed a nonhomogeneous nano-crystalline MgO layer. MgO is relatively soluble in water and does not provide sufficient corrosion protection. Among various surface treatment methods, conversion of the non-protective magnesium oxide to carbonate products is possible depending on the environmental conditions. This work used a simple experimental method using CO2 and water vapour to achieve surface carbonation of Mg powders. Two carbonated samples and pure magnesium were prepared by direct extrusion. The samples after carbonation retained good mechanical properties and the layer of carbonates had a significant impact on corrosion resistance. 1 day carbonation resulted in transformation of native oxide into amorphous layer and reduction of corrosion rate. Longer carbonation (10 days) revealed layer growth and transformation of native oxide to crystalline nesquehonite structure.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Electrocatalytic Kinetics via Synergy of Co Nanoparticles and Co/Ni&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;C- and N-Doped Porous Carbon</title>

                Transition-metal species embedded in carbon have sparked intense interest in the fields of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, improvement of the electrocatalytic kinetics remains a challenge caused by the synergistic assembly. Here, we propose a biochemical strategy to fabricate the Co nanoparticles (NPs) and Co/Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;C co-embedded N-doped porous carbon (CoNPs&amp;Co/Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;C@NC) catalysts via constructing the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)@yeast precursor. The rich amino groups provide the possibility for the anchorage of Co2+/Ni2+ ions as well as the construction of Co/Ni&#8211;ZIF@yeast through the yeast cell biomineralization effect. The functional design induces the formation of CoNPs and Co/Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;C sites in N-doped carbon as well as regulates the porosity for exposing such sites. Synergy of CoNPs, Co/Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;C, and porous N-doped carbon delivered excellent electrocatalytic kinetics (the ORR Tafel slope of 76.3 mV dec&#8211;1 and the OER Tafel slope of 80.4 mV dec&#8211;1) and a high voltage of 1.15 V at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 for the discharge process in zinc air batteries. It provides an effective strategy to fabricate high-performance catalysts.</description>

      <title>Sulfite&#8208;Assisted Acetate Conversion from CO Electroreduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202400683</link>
      <description>Jingjiao Ma, Tianyang Liu, Shuya Hao, Sun Yan, Zikai Xu, Songtao Yang, Haifeng Shen, Yu Jing, Peng Chen, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398169070

                The efficient acetate conversion from CO electroreduction is challenging due to the poor selectivity at high reaction rate, which requires the competition with H2 and other C2+ (i.e., ethylene, ethanol, n-propanol) reduction products. Electrolyte engineering is one of the efficient strategies to regulate the reaction microenvironment. In this work, the adding of sulfite (SO32-) with high nucleophilicity in KOH electrolytes was demonstrated to enable improving the CO-to-acetate conversion via generating a S-O chemical bond between SO32- and oxygenated *C2 intermediates (i.e., *CO-CO, *CO-COH) compared with that in pure KOH system on both synthesized Cu(200)- and normal commercial Cu(111)-facets-exposed metallic Cu catalysts. As a result, the prepared Cu(200)-facets-exposed metallic Cu catalyst with surface ions modification showed an superior Faradaic efficiency of 63.6% at -0.6 A&#183;cm-2, and extraordinary absolute value of peak partial current density as high as 1.52 A&#183;cm-2 with adding SO32- in KOH electrolytes, compared to the best reported values in both CO and CO2 electroreduction. Our work suggests an attractive strategy to introduce the oxyanion with high nucleophilicity in electrolytes to regulate the microenvironment for industrial-current-density electrosynthesis of acetate from CO electroreduction.</description>

      <title>Feature selection for coal heating level estimation in thermal power plants</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2298/tsci240124124v</link>
      <description>Sanja Vujnovi&#263;, Dejan Cvetinovi&#263;, Vukman Bakic, &#381;eljko Djurovi&#263;, Thermal science/Thermal Science. None(00)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398150914

                Several recently signed environmental agreements and protocols emphasize the global need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a focus on limiting coal consumption due to high NOX and CO2 emissions. However, many countries, including those in the Western Balkans, rely heavily on coal for electricity generation. The outdated thermal power plant infrastructure in these regions poses a major challenge when it comes to meeting modern environmental standards while maintaining efficiency. This study is part of the more comprehensive research which aims to develop an expert system that utilizes existing measurements to estimate key parameters crucial for both energy production and pollution reduction. The focus is on Serbian thermal power plants, particularly plant ?Nikola Tesla? unit B1. One of the critical parameters for optimizing thermal power plant control loops is the heating value of coal, which is challenging to measure in real time due to the coal's varying chemical compositions and caloric values. This paper examines 74 different parameters measured in 59 instances to estimate the hating value of coal at unit B1. Through detailed analysis and feature selection methods, including linear regression, this research aims to identify the most informative parameters for estimating the heating value of coal, which will improve the control system that enables more efficient and environmentally friendly power generation in coal fired thermal power plants.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature thermocatalytic removal of formaldehyde in air using copper manganite spinels</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.119186</link>
      <description>Yongbiao Hua, Kumar Vikrant, Ki&#8211;Hyun Kim, Philippe M. Heynderickx, Danil W. Boukhvalov, Environmental research. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398146958

                The removal of formaldehyde (FA) is vital for indoor air quality management in light of its carcinogenic propensity and adverse environmental impact. A series of copper manganite spinel structures (e.g., CuMn2O4) are prepared using the sol-gel combustion method and treated with reduction or oxidation pretreatment methods at 300&#176;C condition. Accordingly, CuMn2O4-O ("O" suffix for oxidation pre-treatment in air) is identified as the best performer to achieve 100% conversion (XFA) of FA (50 ppm) at 90&#176;C; its performance, if assessed in terms of reaction kinetic rate (r) at XFA =10%, is 5.02E-03 mmol g-1 h-1. The FA removal performance increases systematically with decreases in flow rate, FA concentration, and relative humidity (RH) or with increases in bed mass. The reaction pathways and intermediates of FA catalytic oxidation on CuMn2O4-A are studied with density functional theory simulations, temperature-programmed characterization experiments, and in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. The synergistic combination of large quantities of adsorbed oxygen (OA) species and oxidized metal species (e.g., Cu2+) contribute to the enhanced catalytic performance of CuMn2O4-O to oxidize FA into CO2 with the reaction intermediates of H2CO2 (DOM), HCOO-, and CO. The present study is expected to provide valuable insights into the thermocatalytic oxidation of FA over spinel CuMn2O4 materials and their catalytic performances in relation to the key process variables.</description>

      <title>Two-tier Synergistic Optimization of Integrated Energy Systems Based on Comprehensive Self-Adaptive Operation Strategy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2024.131727</link>
      <description>Jinqiang Huang, Yi Jiang, Guiqiang Li, Energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398147464

                Integrated Energy Systems (IES) play a pivotal role in achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals. However, previous research in IES operation has mainly focused on energy flow constraints, neglecting the impacts of renewable energy output, energy prices, carbon emission, and storage status. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a Comprehensive Self-Adaptive (CSA) operation strategy as a key component of our two-tier synergistic optimization method, optimizing an IES integrated with Concentrated Photovoltaic/Thermal systems. In the upper-tier capacity configuration, the proposed method considers the full life-cycle carbon emissions of equipment. In the lower-tier operational strategy optimization, the CSA operation strategy automatically adjusts energy generation, utilization, and storage by comprehensively evaluating hourly operating costs, hourly carbon emissions, and hourly storage benefits. Compared to traditional operation strategies and other adaptive methods, the newly developed strategy consistently demonstrates superior performance. When contrasted with separate energy systems, IES operating under the CSA operation strategy markedly stands out, achieving a cost savings rate of 25.87%, a CO2 reduction rate of 61.54%, and an electricity matching ratio of 91.24%. Additionally, the paper explores the performance of the CSA operation strategy across various regions, confirming its feasibility and generalizability under diverse load and irradiance conditions.</description>

      <title>Research on the energy efficiency improvement of closed loop wastewater source heat pump with direct-expansion heat exchanger</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2298/tsci231223115l</link>
      <description>Yuanyuan Liu, Tiekun Jia, Wang Jing, Lijun Yang, Jun Zhao, Yirong Wang, Xidong Liang, Thermal science/Thermal Science. None(00)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396928695

                The closed-loop wastewater source heat exchanger (WSHE) has advantages such as being non-clogging and resistant to corrosion, but their heat transfer efficiency is relatively low, therefore it is still not the mainstream form of heat exchanger of wastewater source heat pump (WSHP). A novel CO2 direct-expansion wastewater source heat exchanger (DX-WSHE) is proposed in this paper, aiming to significantly improve the heat transfer rate of the heat exchanger and the energy efficiency of the heat pump system. The direct-expansion heat transfer process is complex, large grid number and long calculation time will be required if calculated by conventional numerical simulation software. Therefore, a three-dimensional transient heat transfer model was developed based on the thermal resistance and capacity model, which offers the advantages of fast computation speed and strong flexibility. The heat transfer and energy efficiency characteristics under different parameters were studied. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the direct-expansion wastewater source heat pump (DX-WSHP) can be increased by 31.0% compared to conventional design, and the heat flux of the direct-expansion wastewater source heat exchanger can be up to 250 W/m for the standard group. Compared with conventional designs, the direct-expansion wastewater source heat pump has excellent heat transfer and energy efficiency capabilities, which is a promising building energy saving and emission reduction technology.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of spent pot-lining to blast furnace tuyere injection</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2024.131890</link>
      <description>Yunpeng Wang, Nan Li, Lei Gao, Haoli Yan, Haoyu Fang, Yan Xin, Linjing Yang, Zhe Shi, Fuel. 371(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398155070

                This study investigated the potential use of spent pot-lining (SPL) as a supplementary fuel in blast furnaces to replace pulverized coal (PC). Based on actual blast furnace operational parameters, a three-dimensional numerical model is established to simulate the complex flow and reaction processes in the tuyere raceway. The impact of the proportion of SPL in the mixed fuel from 0 % to 45 % on the thermochemical characteristics of the mixed fuel combustion is analyzed. The results indicate that with an increase in SPL proportion, the combustion peak temperature (2511 K-2922 K) and the average temperature in the raceway (2014 K-2474 K) of the mixed fuel both increase. However, the combustion rate of the mixed fuel decreases, highlighting the need for a rational design of the mixed fuel ratio to optimize combustion performance. The SPL proportion has minimal influence on the aerodynamic characteristics of the airflow but significantly affects combustion and thermal properties, altering the distribution of gas-phase components. Through linear regression and correlation analysis, linear relationships between SPL proportion and combustion rate, peak temperature in the raceway, and CO and CO2 mass fractions are established. This research holds substantial significance and value in advancing the technology of using industrial waste SPL to replace part of the coal powder as blast furnace injection fuel, promoting the development of green metallurgical technologies, and contributing to global energy conservation and emission reduction.</description>

      <title>Ascorbic Acid Infusion Improves Cerebrovascular Reactivity in Middle-Aged and Older Adults</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1152/physiol.2024.39.s1.2143</link>
      <description>Nicholas Rizzi, Theodore M. DeConne, Faria Sanjana, Elizabeth Habash, Kevin Decker, Joshua C. Hobson, Christopher R. Martens, Physiology. 39(S1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398175485

                Aging is associated with reductions in cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and cerebrovascular conductance (CVC), which may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative disease and stroke. In the peripheral vasculature, increased oxidative stress is linked to vascular dysfunction and is ameliorated following infusion of the antioxidant ascorbic acid (AA). However, oxidative stress&#8217; effect on cerebrovascular function in humans is not entirely understood. PURPOSE: To determine whether oxidative stress reduces CVR and CVC in middle-aged and older adults (MA/O). We hypothesized that AA infusion would increase CVR and CVC in MA/O but not young adults (YA). METHODS: Young (18-29 years) and middle-aged and older (55-79 years) adults were recruited for two identical experimental visits. Each visit consisted of the same measures performed both before and after the infusion of either AA or saline (SAL). Middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCAv) was recorded using a transcranial Doppler ultrasound probe. CVR was tested using a hypercapnia protocol that was achieved with a computer-based gas blender that increased the subjects&#8217; end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PETCO2) 9 mmHg above baseline for a 3-minute period. CVR was defined as the percent change in MCAv during hypercapnia divided by the absolute change in PETCO2. CVC was defined as the percent of CVR normalized for the changes in mean arterial blood pressure. Two-way ANOVAs were used to assess the effects of AA and SAL on CVR and CVC. Fisher&#8217;s LSD tests were used to assess main and interaction effects when necessary. RESULTS: 8 YA (25 + 2 years) and 14 MA/O (65 + 6 years) completed the experimental visits. There was a significant main effect of condition (pre/post) on CVR following SAL infusion (p = 0.016), and a significant age x condition interaction effect on CVR following AA infusion (p = 0.016). There were no significant main or interaction effects on CVC following SAL infusion, but there was a significant age x condition interaction effect on CVC following AA infusion (p = 0.012). Post hoc testing indicated that the difference in CVR following SAL infusion was due to an increase in YA (3.0 + 0.5 %/mmHg pre vs. 3.8 + 1.1 %/mmHg post, p = 0.047), whereas the difference in CVR following AA infusion was due to an increase in MA/O (3.3 + 1.7 %/mmHg pre vs. 4.1 + 1.9 %/mmHg post, p = 0.006). The difference in CVC was indicated to be due to both lower baseline CVC in MA/O (2.3 + 0.4 %/mmHg YA pre vs. 1.3 + 1.1 %/mmHg MA/O pre, p = 0.019) and an increase in CVC in MA/O following AA infusion (1.3 + 1.1 %/mmHg pre vs. 2.0 + 0.5 %/mmHg post, p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: Our main finding is that AA infusion restores CVR and CVC in MA/O, but not YA. This finding suggests that age-related increases in oxidative stress may impair cerebrovascular function.

                In the pursuit of carbon neutrality, state-owned forests are prime candidates for carbon offset projects due to their unique tenure and management characteristics. Employing methodologies endorsed by the International Panel on Climate Change and logistic growth curves, this study assesses the carbon stocks and sequestration potential of established state-owned plantation forests across 31 Chinese provinces from 2023 to 2060, encompassing seven forestry industry groups. This study projects that by 2060, these forests will amass a carbon stock of 558.25 MtC, with the highest stock in Northeast China (122.09 MtC) and the lowest in Northwest China (32.27 MtC), notably showing the highest growth rate at 91.15%. Over the forecast period, they are expected to accumulate a carbon sink of 637.07 MtCO2e, translating to an average annual carbon sink of 17.22 MtCO2e and an average annual carbon sink per unit of 1.41 tons of CO2 per hectare per year. Additionally, state-owned forests have the potential to offset approximately 0.15%&#8211;0.17% of annual carbon emissions, aligning with international climate goals. However, it is essential to note that the conversion of these carbon sinks into tradable carbon credits is subject to specific methodology requirements. Therefore, the future development of carbon offset projects in China&#8217;s state-owned forests should consider the advancement of carbon market mechanisms, including the Chinese Certified Emission Reduction and the introduction of a carbon inclusion mechanism and natural forest methodology, to fully realize their potential contributions to carbon neutrality. In summary, these findings offer valuable insights for shaping the future of carbon offset initiatives within China&#8217;s state-owned forests.</description>

                Microalgae are an excellent carbon concentrators with substantial lipid content. However, biomass production vis-&#224;-vis lipid hyperaccumulation is a major constraint in the biofuel economy. In this regard, Dunaliella salina, an oleaginous, wall less microalga, was grown in graded concentration of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). There was a significant increase in biomass (1.57-fold), photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm = 0.72), and chlorophyll a content in 0.25 mg/L IAA supplemented cultures over the control (stage I). However, supplementation of IAA under nitrogen deprivation (stage II) led to a significant rise in the lipid content (47 % DCW), carbohydrate (18.37 %) and simultaneous reduction in the oxidative status (MDA, H2O2, O2&#183;&#8722;, OH&#183;) over the control. Further, 0.25 mg/L IAA supplemented cultures under nitrogen starvation were undertaken for biomass and lipid characterization. Nile red based flow cytometric analysis revealed an apparent increase in the neutral lipid fluorescence, also validated by 1H- NMR based lipidome, revealing the presence of triacylglycerol (TAG, 4.12&#8211;4.31 ppm). FTIR spectra revealed the increased absorbance at 2926 cm&#8722;1, 1740 cm&#8722;1 and 1025 cm&#8722;1, validating the increased carbohydrate and lipid, while biomass pyrolysis showed 81.42 % decomposition in the active pyrolytic zone as recorded by the TGA/DTG analysis. Interestingly, elemental analysis (CHNS) of the biomass showed an increased carbon and hydrogen %, HHV (19.94 MJ kg&#8722;1), H/C ratio (1.78), and CO2 fixation rate. Thus, the present study opens new avenues for the economic feasibility of bioenergy/biofuel production from microalgal biomass at commercial scale.</description>

The strategy of substituting clinker by supplementary cementitious materials, SCM appears to be the shortest and less capital-intensive path to sustainability. Introducing calcined clays as SCMs in the Russian cement industry will facilitate the production of cements that can be used in all applications. A preliminary analysis of the geology of clays within the Russian Federation shows that several of the clays identified comply with chemical requirements to be used for the production of calcined clays. These clay deposits are very close to the existing cement plants, thus making commercial operation feasible. The combination of calcined clay and limestone becomes a very attractive choice for clinker replacement in cement. Cements containing calcined clay and limestone can reach performance of a pure Portland cement with only 50 % of clinker. The use of calcined clay and limestone as substitutes of clinker induces reductions in carbon emissions in the order of 35-45 % compared to benchmark references, with emission figures estimated within 400-500 kg CO2/ ton of cement. Embracing the LC3 technology could represent an interesting opportunity for cement companies in the Russian Federation to convert their inefficient clinker kilns to clay calciners, and increase cement production with current clinker availability. The Russian Federation has the necessary resources and the potential in technology to become a world leader in the production of LC3 cement.</description>

                Boosting solutions such as turbochargers are one of the popular technologies in the development of IC engines. Turbochargers date back to their usage on aircraft engines in the early nineteenth century and started usage in heavy-duty Caterpillar engines in 1954. Later they were introduced in passenger car applications in the early 1960s and became more popular after the 1990s due to the usage of high-power density engines in passenger cars. Popular technologies in engine air management systems such as variable valve timing (VVT), supercharging, turbocharging and intercooling have significantly improved engine power-to-weight and power-to-displacement ratios. Turbocharging internal combustion engine is widely recognized as one of the best and most cost-effective technologies for the enhanced benefits in power density, low-end torque, fuel consumption (CO2 emissions), transient performance etc. Basis the benefits of fuel efficiency from turbocharging, it is considered as one of the key technologies to adopt for CAFE standards (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) with downsized engines. Globally turbocharging has gained popularity and higher penetration year on year in diesel, gasoline, and bi-fuel /Natural gas engine types. The boosting system has been undergoing upgradation with various add-on features to meet performance and emission needs. The introduction of emission norms like RDE (Real Driving Emission) drives engines to optimise for a reduction in scavenging, maintain &#955; = 1 in full operations and usage of the gas particulate filter to meet the Particulate number (PN) limit. In gasoline engines, there is a need to incorporate advanced combustion technologies like Miller/Atkinson and Low-Pressure Exhaust Gas Recirculation (LPEGR), with lean burn combustion for improved fuel economy. In this chapter, the benefits and challenges of the turbocharger boosting system and its integration into the gasoline engine are described. Additionally, the simpler ways of modelling the engine air management system to help the selection of the right boosting solutions are described.</description>

      <title>Investigation of hybrid power-to-hydrogen/natural gas and hydrogen-to-X system in Cameroon</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2024.05.007</link>
      <description>Husserl Djouodjinang-Fonou, David A. Quansah, Mensah Lena Dzifa, Rahimat Oyiza Yakubu, Armand Fopah&#8208;Lele, Energy reports. 11(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396986143

                In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the capacity to generate energy faces significant hurdles. Despite efforts to integrate renewable energy sources and natural gas power plants into the energy portfolio, the desired reduction in environmental impact and alleviation of energy poverty remain elusive. Hence, exploring a spectrum of hybrid technologies, encompassing storage and hydrogen-based solutions, is imperative to optimize energy production while mitigating harmful emissions. To exemplify this necessity, the 216 MW Kribi gas power plant in Cameroon is the case study. The primary aim is to investigate cutting-edge emissions and energy schemes within the SSA. This paper assessed the minimum complaint load technique and four power-to-fuel options from technical, financial, and environmental perspectives to assess the viability of a natural gas fuel system powered with hydrogen in a hybrid mode. The system generates hydrogen by using water electrolysis, with photovoltaic electricity and gas power plant. This research also assesses process efficiency, storage capacity, annual costs, carbon avoided costs, and production prices for various fuels. Results showed that the LCOE from a photovoltaic solar plant is 0.19$/kWh, with the Power-to-Hydrogen process (76.2% efficiency) being the most efficient, followed by the ammonia and urea processes. The study gives a detailed examination of the hybrid hydrogen natural gas fuel system. According to the annual cost breakdown, the primary costs are associated with the acquisition of electrical energy and electrolyser CAPEX and OPEX, which account for 95% of total costs. Urea is the cheapest mass fuel. However, it costs more in terms of energy. Hydrogen is the most cost-effective source of energy. In terms of energy storage and energy density by volume, the methane resulted as the most suitable solution, while the ammonia resulted as the best H2 storage medium in terms of kg of H2 per m3 of storage (108 kgH2/m3). By substituting the fuel system with 15% H2, the environmental effects are reduced by 1622 tons per year, while carbon capture technology gathered 16,664 tons of CO2 for methanation and urea operations, yielding a total carbon averted cost of 21 $/ton.</description>

      <title>DiagNet-A Hybrid Physics-Data Driven Model for Fractured Reservoir Simulation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/219110-ms</link>
      <description>Billal Maydika Aslam, Bicheng Yan, Knut&#8211;Andreas Lie, Stein Krogstad, Olav M&#248;yner, Xupeng He, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396978316

                Abstract Fractured reservoir simulation is important and applicable to understand many processes related to subsurface geo-energy recovery and storage, such as shale gas/oil, enhanced geothermal systems, and CO2 sequestration in basaltic rocks. However, such simulations are often computationally expensive to capture the high contrast of permeability and pore volume between matrix and fracture. Therefore, a reduced order model (ROM) can be extremely beneficial for fractured reservoir simulation to reduce computational costs for iterative history-matching and reservoir optimization workflows. In this study, we propose a novel ROM that flexibly honors fracture representations, namely DiagNet. In DiagNet, we generate the coarse matrix nodes based on the reservoir outlines, and add extra diagonal connections between non-neighboring matrix nodes if intersecting fractures traverse them, which avoids the inclusion of additional fracture nodes. Since dimensionality reduction methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can facilitate the model parameterization, we adopt PCA to generate quality priors for sampling of the matrix transmissibility and pore volume arrays. Further, the DiagNet models are then calibrated to the well observation data (such as well flow rates and bottom-hole pressures), and a gradient-based optimization method is implemented in a general automatic-differentiable simulator framework to tune the model parameters (e.g., matrix/fracture transmissibilities, pore volumes, and well indices). Our results show that we can perform robust calibration of DiagNet based on the synthetic well observation data from a fine-scale reference simulation model. We have found that it is necessary to incorporate the dominant flow physics (i.e., water breakthrough) from the observation data to improve the training convergence and the prediction accuracy for DiagNet. Further, PCA for parameterization improves the convergence rate of model calibration, as compared to random initialization. Interpretation of the calibrated transmissibility field from DiagNet aligns with high connectivity regions from the fine-scale reference model. As a result, the new DiagNet is interpretable in terms of reservoir connectivity or geology and thus can be used for reservoir history-matching using observation data from the field and the further optimization.</description>

      <title>Contrasting carbon cycle responses to dry (2015 El Ni&#241;o) and wet (2008 La Ni&#241;a) extreme events at an Amazon tropical forest</title>

                Land surface models diverge in their predictions of the Amazon forest's response to climate change-induced droughts, with some showing a catastrophic collapse of forests, while others simulating resilience. Therefore, observations of tropical ecosystem responses to real-world droughts and other extreme events are needed. We report long-term seasonal dynamics of photosynthesis, respiration, net carbon exchange, phenology, and tree demography and characterize the effect of dry and wet events on ecosystem form and function at the Tapaj&#243;s National Forest, Brazil, using over two decades of eddy covariance observations that include the 2015&#8211;2016 El Ni&#241;o drought and La Ni&#241;a 2008&#8211;2009 wet periods. We found strong forest responses to both ENSO events: La Ni&#241;a saw forest net carbon loss from reduced photosynthesis (due to lower incoming radiation from increased cloudiness) even as ecosystem respiration (Reco) was maintained at mean seasonal levels. El Ni&#241;o induced the opposite short-term effect, net carbon gains, despite significant reductions in photosynthesis (from a drought-induced halving of canopy conductance to CO2 and significant losses of leaf area), because drought suppression of Reco losses was even greater. However, long-term responses to the two climate perturbations were very different: transient during La Ni&#241;a &#8211;the forest returned to its "normal" state as soon as the climate did, and long-lasting during El Ni&#241;o &#8211;leaf area loss and associated declines in photosynthetic capacity (Pc) and canopy conductance were exacerbated and extended by feedbacks from higher temperatures and atmospheric evaporative demand and persisted for &#8764;3+ years after normal rainfall resumed. These findings indicate that these forests are more vulnerable to drought than to excess rain, because drought drives significant changes in forest structure (e.g., leaf-abscission and mortality) and ecosystem function (e.g. reduced stomatal conductance). As future Amazonian climate change increases frequencies of hydrological extremes, these mechanisms will determine the long-term fate of tropical forests.</description>

However, highest performance in solar energy conversion can only be achieved, when using optimum absorber layers and advanced contact formation for electronic and chemical passivation, i.e. for the protection of the solid-liquid interface against corrosion as well as impeding interfacial non-radiative recombination. In order to address the surface and interface properties of III-V semiconductor layer structures in relation to their performance, we present the synthesis, theoretical modelling and properties of critical and well-defined interfaces such as GaInP/AlInP [4] or GaInP/GaN [5]. Here, lattice matched n-type GaN or AlInP(100) charge selective contacts are prepared on n-p GaInP(100) top absorbers in highest-efficiency III&#8211;V multijunction solar or photoelectrochemical cells, where the cell performance can be greatly limited by missing electron selectivity and detrimental valance band offsets. Hence, understanding of the atomic and electronic properties of the heterointerfaces, for instance, is crucial for the reduction of photocurrent losses in III&#8211;V multijunction devices. We discuss the essential considerations on the properties of critical interfaces in relation to photoelectrochemical cells from a conceptual and from a theoretical modeling point of view assuming mostly idealized surface conditions. We also address latest progress on the important III-V/Si interface, modifications by fine-tuning of the preparation and describe experimental model experiments on the surface reactivity of III-phosphide surfaces to H2O exposure. These different surface science approaches are then related to photoelectrochemical cells for H2 evolution and CO2 reduction using different III-V based tandem cells and providing highest conversion yields.

                A large number of oceanic metagenomic data and environmental metadata have been published. However, most studies focused on limited ecosystems using different analysis tools, making it challenging to integrate these data into robust results and comprehensive global understanding of marine microbiome. Here, we constructed a systematic and quantitative analysis platform, the Microbiome Atlas/Sino-Hydrosphere for Ocean Ecosystem (MASH-Ocean: https://www.biosino.org/mash-ocean/), by integrating global marine metagenomic data and a unified data processing flow. MASH-Ocean 1.0 comprises 2147 metagenomic samples with five analysis modules: sample view, diversity, function, biogeography, and interaction network. This platform provides convenient and stable support for researchers in microbiology, environmental science, and biogeochemistry, to ensure the integration of omics data generated from hydrosphere ecosystems, to bridge the gap between elusive omics data and biological, ecological, and geological discovery, ultimately to foster the formation of a comprehensive atlas for aquatic environments. Oceans account for approximately 71% of the total surface area of Earth, making them the largest habitats for life on this planet. They contribute to over 90% of the total volume of the biosphere and are responsible for nearly half of the global total primary productivity [1]. It has been estimated that marine ecosystems host a remarkable number of over 1029 bacterial and archaeal cells [2]. These microbes exhibit vast diversity and are ubiquitously distributed across various oceanic environments, including both sea water and subsurface from intertidal zone, euphotic layer, and deep sea. Moreover, they thrive in special geological areas such as hydrothermal vents, cold seep regions, subduction zones, and oceanic crust. Active biogeochemical cycling mediated by these microorganisms through their carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolisms can directly influence the Earth's climate [3]. Therefore, it is critical to understand the diversity, function, and biogeography of marine microbiome. With the ongoing advancements in oceanic sampling technologies and high-throughput sequencing platforms in recent years, scientists have discovered a wide variety of microorganisms with different ecological and geological functions in various marine habitats [4]. Microorganisms inhabiting distinct ecological niches may specifically play key roles in driving certain geochemical cycles and mediating the fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur among sediment, sea water, and atmosphere [3]. Currently, an increasing number of metagenomic studies focusing on various types of oceanic environments have been reported [5]. For example, in sea water, archaea, bacteria, protist, and virus have been found to play significant roles in influencing the release of organic matter, mineralization, and fixation of carbon dioxide [6]. In sediments, the abundance and diversity of microorganisms is much higher than that in marine water bodies and primarily facilitates the anaerobic degradation of organic matter, sulfate reduction, methane production, and oxidation [7]. In summary, the analyses of multiple omics data have revealed a significant presence of microorganisms in oceanic environments that actively participate in the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur elements. Although high-throughput metagenomic sequencing technology has greatly promoted microbiological research, each individual study has employed different analytical processes. These analysis results often show substantial heterogeneity when compared with each other. Only by accumulating and analyzing metagenomic data in a standard way, scientists would be able to reach robust conclusions and generate comparable results. Several platforms, such as Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes (IMG/M) [8] and Marine Metagenomics Portal (MMP) [9], support preliminary analysis of metagenomic or genomic data. Recent developments of online microbiome analysis platforms, for example, Wekemo Bioincloud [10] and MicrobiomeAnalyst [11], have also facilitated researchers in exploring the biological significance of metagenomic samples by providing multiple analysis tools and interactive visualization capabilities. Nevertheless, a gap still exists between elusive omics data and biological, ecological, and geological discovery. Here, we have established an online microbiome platform called the Microbiome Atlas/Sino-Hydrosphere for Ocean Ecosystems (MASH-Ocean, https://www.biosino.org/mash-ocean/), aiming to bridge this gap and achieve standardized, interactive analyses of massive metagenomic data, and to explore the knowledge atlas related to microbial mediated oceanic carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling. MASH-Ocean is a website-based platform (Figure 1A). This platform collects public metagenome data related to global marine environments and assembles and annotates these data with a uniform standard bioinformatic workflow. The current database contains annotations of microbial taxonomic features derived from metagenomic reads and metabolic functional features from assembled metagenomic contigs. These results can be visualized by online users without the well-established knowledge of bioinformatics and omics. Three major advantages of the MASH-Ocean platform are microbial diversity analysis, metabolic feature reconstruction and comparison using selectable metagenomic datasets globally, as well as interactive visualization of global distribution of the selected functional genes or microbial species (Movie S1). All data within MASH-Ocean 1.0 was collected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and the National Omics Data Encyclopedia (NODE) databases (https://www.biosino.org/node/) by September 2020 with a total of 75 keywords (Table S1). Metagenomes were also filtered out manually by their size (below 200 MB), descriptions such as "enriched," "metatranscriptome," and "amplicon," as well as the restricted datasets from DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI). In total, 2147 samples from different marine environments were selected for further analyses to build a basic knowledge pool for MASH-Ocean 1.0 (Figure 1B). Additionally, MASH-Ocean keeps downloading and filtering public oceanic metagenomic data to maintain and update this platform. The second batch of data (September 2023) has been downloaded and is under the analyzing process. The MASH-Ocean 1.0 workflow encompasses both reads-level and contigs-level analyses (Figure 1C,D). Specifically, the platform currently hosts two primary data categories: "clean reads" consisting of 210 billion sequences (totaling 44.2 trillion base pairs) and "contigs" comprising 257 million sequences (totaling 555.3 billion base pairs). For microbial taxonomy analysis, trimmed metagenomic reads were annotated by Kraken2 v2.1.3 [12], and the abundance was estimated by Bracken v2.6.1 [13]. For metabolic feature analysis, the trimmed reads were assembled by MEGAHIT v1.2.9 [14]. The contigs coverage was calculated by mapping the trimmed reads to each contig using BBMap v38.18 [15]. All contigs were subjected to open reading frame (ORF) prediction with Prodigal v2.6.3 [16]. The predicted ORFs were annotated by eggNOG database [17]. On this platform, all samples can be found in "Sample view" section on the website. The table here shows 10 key information of samples. Users can locate specific samples or narrow down the sample pool by providing key information in the navigation panel (Figure 1B). For the fields of Run/Project/Sample ID, we provide a field matching search mode, allowing users to match all complete fields and help them select the appropriate item by typing in part of the string. For the fields of Habitat source, Env Zone, Env Medium, Fraction, and Location, we provide a composite selection method that combines field matching with a drop-down box to provide users with a convenient operation experience. Flexible selections are also supported by providing a drag bar with information of longitude, latitude, and water depth. The selected samples can be displayed on a global topographic map by clicking on the "Display Map" button, located at the top right of the sample table, to easily obtain a panoramic view of sample distribution. MASH-Ocean also provides a comprehensive diversity analysis using taxonomic information produced through the annotation of metagenomic reads. Users can either generate microbial diversity profiles at different taxonomic levels or statistically compare the diversity among different samples by setting up distinct groups. In general, this platform allows users to establish five groups in total to carry out the diversity comparison, with at least three selected samples in each group. The diversity statistical comparison results can be divided into different taxonomic levels, that is, archaea, bacteria, eukaryota, and viruses, each of which contains six ranks including Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species. In total, four types of comparisons are included in the platform (Figure 2A). The first diagram is the taxonomic composition of the selected samples calculated by Kraken2 and Bracken programs. The second analysis is the ranking of taxonomically distinctive members between different groups, which is calculated by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe). The third analysis is the heatmap of beta-diversity distances using Jaccard or Bray-Curtis matrix, and a principal coordinates analysis of all selected samples will also be calculated and displayed by using the beta-diversity distances. The function analysis is designed for the visualization of the presence and abundance of key genes and modules from the major carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolic functional pathways of selected samples. These pathways are critical for global biogeochemical cycling and may therefore influence the Earth's climate. The function analysis module allows users to integrate their own data set with the MASH-Ocean database through three options. One can upload a file with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Orthology (KO) list with the sequencing depth corresponding to those KOs. Users can also upload a file with the predicted ORFs ID and annotated KOs, as well as a sequencing depth file together. The final result will be displayed as a KEGG map, and the relative abundance of metabolic functional genes are shown in red gradient color (Figure 2B). If the number of uploaded or selected samples exceeds three, the relative abundance of metabolic functional genes and further distilled KEGG modules will be displayed in a heatmap for better exhibition. MASH-Ocean contains the function of interactive biogeography visualization and analysis. It supports global distribution display for both microbial species and metabolic functional genes. For microbial species analysis, users can either enter a species name or upload a genome to check their global distribution pattern in all or selected metagenomic data set in MASH-Ocean (Figure 2C). MASH-Ocean also allows users to upload their genomes and will be classified using GTDB-Tk version 2.3.2 [18] for taxonomic assignment. Similarly, for metabolic functional genes, one can select the gene name provided within the website or enter a KO entry and then it will be displayed on the global map on our website. MASH-Ocean also contains the function of interactive network visualization. Six pre-established global microbial co-occurrence networks on the species, genus, family, order, class, and phylum levels were integrated. If users focus on the interaction of one or several specific microbes in the global oceanic microbial network, they can enter the name or taxonomic ranks of the microbe. Then this microbe will be highlighted in the entire network and users can either download the complete network or the network of their focused microbe (Figure 2D). The co-occurrence networks were generated using FastSpar v1.0.0 [19] and iDIRECT [20], and parameters are listed in Table S2. MASH-Ocean takes approximately 10&#8211;50 min to process the diversity analysis module (Figure 2E), depending on the scale of analysis (ranging from 6 to 150 samples). For the function analysis and biogeography module, the time requirements vary due to the time-consuming sequence preprocessing steps. For instance, when annotating metabolic functions in the function analysis module, MASH-Ocean requires around 1 h for one file with size ~50 MB. In contrast, other modes complete this task in less than 5 min. For the biogeography module, MASH-Ocean processes one genome file in approximately 35 min, and a protein sequence file in about 10 min, while other modes complete tasks with similar sample scales in less than 20 s. As the initiative platform for the MASH project in China, MASH-Ocean offers a convenient and stable service to ensure the integration of omics data generated from hydrosphere ecosystems. In comparison to existing omics online servers, such as IMG/M [8], which focused mainly on storage of metagenomic data with limited capabilities in systematic comparison and visualization, while Wekemo Bioincloud [10] or MicrobiomeAnalyst [11] that specifically provided online analysis tools for meta-omics, MASH-Ocean is designed to provide exploratory insights from a big data perspective for researchers through a one-station service. In the future, besides ocean ecosystems, MASH will include other hydrosphere ecosystems such as wetlands, lakes, rivers, and so on. For the MASH-Ocean platform, there are three aspects that will be upgraded in the coming years. First, the data collection process will continue to accommodate more publicly available resources. Second, except for metagenome, we will include published metatranscriptome data in the future version. Third, we also aim to include microbial genomic data to enhance the integrity of MASH-Ocean. Last but not the least, we will further closely cooperate with other databases and online analysis platforms such as the integrated microbiome analysis cloud platform, an eLibrary of Microbial Systematics and Genomics, NODE databases to enlarge and diversify the content of the MASH-Ocean platform.

      <title>Resistance exercise following short term muscle disuse leads to enhanced mitochondrial activity and dynamics</title>

                Introduction: Short-term muscle unloading (~7-10 days) can be usually experienced following injury or hospitalisation, leading to muscle disuse atrophy, muscle weakness and changes in motor control. In such contexts, exercise countermeasures can be employed to overcome these neuromuscular impairments. Surprisingly, the effects of exercise countermeasures following the exposure to muscle unloading has been scarcely investigated. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the functional and molecular adaptations to a 21-day resistance training (RT) program following short term muscle disuse. We hypothesised that a period of resistance exercise following short-term unloading would speed up the recovery on muscle mass and function mostly by an effcient counteraction of the molecular regulators of muscle disuse atrophy consistent with the exercise modality employed. Methods: A 10-day unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) model was applied to eleven healthy young males (22.09 &#177; 2.91 y), followed by a 21-day RT program for the knee extensors performed at 70% of the 1RM (3 times/wk, 9 sessions in total). Data acquisition was performed before the ULLS period, after 10 days of unloading and after 21 days of resistance exercise. Quadriceps femoris isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) was evaluated by dynamometry and quadriceps CSA was assessed by ultrasonography. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, a key component of the citric acid cycle and of the respiratory electron transfer chain) staining was performed on frozen cryosections obtained from VL biopsies, whereas western blot analyses were carried out for several mitochondrial-related proteins and transcriptomics data were obtained by RNA-seq. Results: Following ULLS, QF MVC and CSA decreased (-29.3%, p&lt;0.001, and -4.5%, p&lt;0.05, respectively). After the 21-d of RT, MVC was fully brought back (+42% compared to post-ULLS) whereas QF CSA showed a very marked hypertrophy (+18.6%, p&lt;0.001, compared to post-ULLS). SDH immunoreactivity was not affected by unloading but revealed a significant increase after exercise compared to post ULLS values (~+20%, p&lt;0.001). In addition, mitochondrial dynamics were highly influenced by resistance exercise, as mitochondrial pro-fusion (MFN1, MFN2, OPA1) and fission (DRP1, pDRP1616) proteins were markedly increased in response to RT compared to post-ULLS values (p&lt;0.05). Further, PGC-1a levels showed a trend to decrease after ULLS but even a stronger trend to increase after resistance exercise compared to post-ULLS (p=0.056). Transcriptomics analyses showed that the most differentially expressed genes were identified in the pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation, in which the top regulated genes after resistance training were mitochondrial related genes (CKMT2, UQCRH, ACSS1, MDH1, COX7A2, CYCS, SLC16A1), presenting a marked reduction after ULLS and being significantly enhanced after RT. When compared to baseline, the genes which showed a positive &#8220;rebound effect&#8221; after resistance exercise were mostly related to mitochondrial function (MT-ATP6, MT-CO2, MT-ND3). Noteworthy, among these latter genes, the top upregulated one was APLNR, coding for apelin receptor protein, a positive regulator of inter-myofibrillar mitochondrial content in sarcopenia and ageing. Conclusions: Resistance exercise was effective in recovering muscle mass and function after 10 days of disuse, but it enhanced mitochondrial activity, biogenesis, and dynamics far beyond the expected effects for such exercise modality. In fact, mitochondrial-related genes expression was the most affected by exercise. This suggests that mitochondrial dynamics could play an essential role in the recovery of neuromuscular alterations induced by short term disuse. We put forward the hypothesis that the prior level of physical activity and a prior exposure to short-term muscle disuse could be driving the nature of adaptations to subsequent resistance training.
