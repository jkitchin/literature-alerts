                Abstract Increasing emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere due to the use of fossil fuels and ongoing deforestation are affecting the global climate. To reach the Paris climate agreement, in the coming decades low emission technologies must be developed, which allow for carbon removal on a Gt per year&#8208;scale. In this regard, we propose the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to oxalic acid as a potentially viable pathway for large scale CO 2 utilization and storage. Combined with water oxidation, in principle this transformation does not need stoichiometric amounts of co&#8208;reagents and minimize the necessary electrons for the reduction of carbon dioxide.</description>

      <title>Tuning Strategies of Indium&#8208;Based Catalysts for Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>

                In electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR), indium (In)&#8208;based catalysts with low toxicity and environmental benefits are renowned for their specific high selectivity for formic acid and intrinsic inertia for the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. However, recent studies have reported various products over In&#8208;based catalysts showing comparable or even higher selectivity for carbon monoxide (CO) than for formic acid (HCOOH), puzzling the reaction pathway for CO 2 reduction. This article presents a comprehensive review of recent studies on electrocatalytic CO 2 RR over In&#8208;based catalysts highlighting the formation pathway of specific products. First, the mechanism of electrocatalytic CO 2 RR with the multiple reaction pathways is concluded considering the relationship between reaction intermediates and selectivity. Furthermore, the regulation strategies for multiple product formation are summarized, including crystalline phase engineering, alloying, nanostructuring, and structural modulation of In single atom, where the effect of key intermediates (*COOH, *OOCH, and *OCHO) on product generation is systematically discussed to achieve high selectivity. Finally, the intrinsic regulation mechanisms of these strategies are analyzed and the challenges and opportunities for the development of next&#8208;generation In&#8208;based catalysts are proposed.</description>

                Photocatalysis presents a promising pathway for clean energy generation by leveraging solar energy under environmentally benign conditions with minimal pollutant emissions. However, its widespread application is hindered by low catalytic efficiency, stemming from limited light absorption, rapid recombination of photo-excited electrons, and suboptimal charge carrier potential for target reactions. This review discusses advanced strategies to enhance photocatalytic performance by modulating photocatalytic supports and refining co-catalysts. Techniques such as hydrogenation and extrinsic doping of photocatalytic supports are highlighted for their ability to broaden light absorption and prolong electron lifetimes. Additionally, the strategic design of co-catalysts, including the use of nanoclusters and atomically dispersed catalysts, is emphasized for optimizing charge carrier potential and improving atomic utilization efficiency. This review aims to guide researchers in developing high-performance photocatalysts for clean energy applications, including CO2 reduction and plastic waste photoreforming, thereby contributing to the advancement of sustainable energy technologies.</description>

                To achieve high catalytic activity of artificial photosystems in carbon dioxide reduction or water reduction/oxidation into renewable energy vectors, the use of sacrificial electron do-nors (SEDs) remains mandatory. Despite significant progress in artificial photocatalysis, a detailed understanding of the influence of the SEDs on the reaction mechanism is still lack-ing. We have explored the roles of triethanolamine as SED in the selective CO2 to formic acid photoreduction promoted by various pentamethylcyclopentadienyl rhodium(III)-based porous materials as model catalysts, including polyoxometalate-doped systems. In the pres-ence of anionic polyoxometalates, agglomeration of protonated triethanolamine close to the catalytically active site favours H2 evolution over CO2 reduction, which can be modulated through the degree of confinement imposed by the pores size. Radical trapping experiments and EPR spectroscopy show that triethanolamine-radicals are crucial for a high activity in CO2 reduction. Triethanolamine-radicals act as electron relays in the efficient two-electron activation of the catalyst, regardless whether a homogeneous or a heterogeneous catalyst is used. In contrast, triethylamine-radicals cause deactivation of the one-electron reduced cata-lyst, thus highlighting the effect of different SED-intermediates and underling the im-portance of an appropriate SED.</description>

                Coupling desalination with electrocatalytic reactions is an emerging approach to simultaneously addressing freshwater scarcity and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the salt removal rate in such processes is slow, and the applicable water sources are often limited to those with high salt concentrations. Herein, we show high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic desalination by coupling with electrochemical CO2 reduction using a carbon catalyst. A ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;derived carbon catalyst embedded with Cu nanoparticles delivers a high Faradaic efficiency of 94.3% for CO production at 288 &#956;mol cm&#8208;2 h&#8208;1. The efficient CO2 electroreduction generates high current densities, which drive fast salt ion transfer across ion exchange membranes. The integrated device enables one of the quickest salt removal rates of 1043.49 &#956;g cm&#8208;2 min&#8208;1 among various desalination methods. Drinking water can be obtained with an ion removal rate of 99% when natural seawater is used as the water source.</description>

                The results of a thermodynamic analysis of the course of chemical reactions of the stepwise reduction of manganese from its dioxide by CO gas and the gasification reaction of solid carbon (Bella-Boudoir) are presented. The goals of the work are to obtain eigenexpressions for calculating the numerical values of the Gibbs free energy depending on temperature using tabulated values of the standard enthalpies of formation and entropies of inorganic substances, as well as to construct graphical dependences of the Gibbs energy on temperature using formulas from literary sources and obtained expressions. Numerical values of the boundary temperatures are obtained above which the chemical reactions of the stepwise reduction of manganese from its dioxide by CO gas and the chemical reaction of gasification of solid carbon (Bella-Boudoir) can or cannot thermodynamically proceed. Considering the complete coincidence of the obtained data on the own (obtained) expressions using two (direct and indirect) methods, it is possible to consider with a significant degree of probability the numerical values of the boundary temperature for the reactions of stepwise reduction of manganese from its dioxide and gasification of solid carbon as reliable, which indicates the possibility of the reduction of Mn2O3 from MnO2, Mn3O4 from Mn2O3 and MnO from Mn3O4 by CO gas, the Bell-Boudoir reaction and the impossibility of the reduction of manganese from MnO by CO gas at the temperatures of the actual process in reduction furnaces. This also confirms that CO gas is not a manganese reducer at the last stage of stepwise reduction of MnO according to scheme (B), refuting any theories and assumptions about the possibility of reducing Mn from MnO by CO gas.</description>

Copper-based bimetallic catalysts are particularly appealing for CO2RR due to their unique ability to generate multi-carbon products. While substantial effort has been devoted to developing new catalysts, the evolution of bimetallic systems under operational conditions remains underexplored. In this work, we synthesized a series of CuxNi1&#8722;x nanoparticles and investigated their structural evolution during CO2RR. Due to the higher oxophilicity of Ni compared to Cu, the particles tend to become Ni-enriched at the surface upon air exposure, promoting the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). At negative activation potentials, cathodic corrosion has been observed in CuxNi1&#8722;x nanoparticles, leading to the significant Ni loss and the formation of irregularly shaped Cu nanoparticles with increased defects. This structural evolution, driven by cathodic corrosion, shifts the electrolysis from HER toward CO2 reduction, significantly enhancing the Faradaic efficiency of multi-carbon products (C2+).</description>

      <title>Ligand-Modulated Cu Reconstruction to Steer the Hydride/Hydroxyl Pathway of Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54227/elab.20240010</link>

                Reconstructing metal-organic complexes effectively generates hybrid nanocatalysts for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (eCO2R), but the role of metal-ligand interactions in shaping these hybrids and their influence on the electronic states of the reduced Cu species remain unclear. Herein, we impregnate Cu(II) acetate (Cu(OAc)2) into two Zirconium-based metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with different ligands to in situ construct Cu-based nanocatalysts for eCO2R. We show that Cu-ligand interactions crucially determine the transformation of Cu(OAc)2 during electrolysis, with biphenyl linkers forming agglomerated Cu2O particles and bipyridine linkers yielding highly dispersed Cu crystallites. This ligand-modulated Cu reconstruction diverges eCO2R towards C2 and C1 pathways, with agglomerated Cu2O particles producing C2+ products and smaller Cu crystallites achieving a maximum CH4 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 60.3% &#177; 0.5% at 600 mA/cm2. In situ IR and Raman spectra unveil that larger Cu2O particles accumulate Cu-OH, increasing local alkalinity and *CO coverage, which favors asymmetric C-C coupling to yield C2+ products. Conversely, smaller Cu crystallites undergo rapid consumption of OH- and Cu-OH, decreasing alkalinity and promoting metal hydride (M-H) formation and sequential hydrogenation of *CO toward CH4 production. This study signifies the exploitation of metal-organic filler-host interactions to manipulate catalyst reconstruction for tailoring local environment towards selective eCO2R.</description>

                Halide anion adsorption on transition metals can improve the performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), while the specific reaction mechanisms governing selective CO2RR pathways remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time the distinct pathways for gaseous (CO) and liquid products (formate and ethanol) on the well&#8208;defined Ag&#8208;Cu nanostructures with controlled chlorination, respectively. We show that CO2 conversion to CO on Ag/AgCl can be tuned by adjusting the thickness of AgCl layer, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) near 100% over a broad potential range in a 0.5 M KHCO3 using flow cell. In contrast, the optimized Cl&#8208;Ag/Cu system enables the conversion of CO2 into liquid products including formate and ethanol with a total FE nearing 100%, delivering high current density under similar conditions. In situ infrared experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the lateral adsorbate of *OCHO intermediate facilitates the thermodynamics of both the CO pathway on Cl&#8208;Ag(111) and the formate pathway on Cl&#8208;Ag/Cu(111) by reducing Gibbs free energy barriers of each potential&#8208;limit step. This work uncovers the role of chlorination in the tuning of C&#8208;bound or O&#8208;bound intermediates during CO2RR on Ag&#8208;Cu catalysts, determining the reaction pathway under lateral adsorbate effects.</description>

      <title>Computational Study of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on 2D Graphitic Carbon Nitride Supported Single&#8208;Atom (Al and P) Catalysts (SACs)</title>

                To mitigate the adverse effects of CO2 emissions, CO2 electroreduction to small organic products is a preferable solution and potential catalysts include the single&#8208;atom catalyst (SAC) which comprises individual atoms dispersed on 2D materials. Here, we used aluminium and phosphorus as the active sites for CO2 electroreductions by embedding them on the 2D graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4) nano&#8208;surface. The resulting M&#8208;C3N4 (M = Al and P) SACs were computationally studied for the CO2 electroreduction using density functional theory (DFT) and ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Computations showed that CO2 can be adsorbed to the active sites in forms of a frustrated Lewis pair (Al/N or P/N) or single atom Al or P. The adsorbed CO2 can be converted to various intermediates by gaining proton and electron (H+ + e&#8208;) pairs, a process simulated as electroreduction. While both SACs prefer to produce HCOOH with low potential determining steps (PDSs) and small overpotential values of 0.25 V and 0.08 V for Al&#8208;C3N4 and P&#8208;C3N4 respectively, to produce CH4, P&#8208;C3N4 exhibits a lower potential barrier of 0.9 eV than Al&#8208;C3N4 (1.07~1.17 eV).</description>

      <title>Porous Carbon Nanorods Encapsulating Bismuth Nanoparticles Promote p-Si Nanowire Array for Photoelectrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction to Formate</title>

                Photoelectrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to high value-added chemicals is one of the effective means to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate the energy crisis. In this study, porous carbon nanorods encapsulating bismuth (Bi) nanoparticles were synthesized using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)-assisted spatial confinement and high-temperature carbonization strategy and then modified on silicon nanowires to construct a Si&#8211;Bi@Cx composite photocathode. The presence of the plasmonic metal Bi enhances the light absorption and improves the selectivity of carbon dioxide reduction products as reactive substances. At &#8722;0.9 V vs RHE, the Si&#8211;Bi@C800 photocathode achieves a faradaic efficiency for formic acid (FEHCOOH) of up to 91.23%, with a production rate of 88.5 &#956;mol&#183;h&#8211;1&#183;cm&#8211;2. Further experimental analysis and in situ infrared spectroscopy results showed that the porous carbon nanorods with strong hydrophobicity not only reduce the contact between the electrode and water and inhibit the occurrence of the hydrogen evolution reaction but also accelerate the mass transfer of CO2 molecules and increase the local CO2 concentration. Simultaneously, Bi nanoparticles promote the formation of the *OCHO intermediate and realize the efficient conversion of CO2 to formic acid. This study lays a foundation for constructing active sites on silicon-based semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Embodied Carbon in Concrete: Insights from Indonesia and Comparative Analysis with UK and USA</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48084/etasr.8781</link>
      <description>Militia Keintjem, Riza Suwondo, Lee S. Cunningham, H.A. Razak, Engineering Technology &amp; Applied Science Research. 14(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404979012

                Concrete is the most widely used construction material globally. However, its production, particularly that of cement, is a significant source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, contributing to approximately 8% - 10% of the global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This study aims to analyze and compare the embodied carbon (eCO2) of various concrete strength grades commonly utilized in Indonesia to offer insights for enhancing sustainability in the construction industry. The methodology involved designing concrete mixes according to Indonesian standards and calculating carbon emissions for each component. The findings revealed that the eCO2 in the Indonesian concrete mixes was significantly higher than that reported in the UK and US databases. This higher carbon footprint emerges primarily due to the greater cement content found in the Indonesian mixes. Nevertheless, the current study demonstrated that using fly ash as a supplementary cementitious material can substantially reduce the eCO2, with the mix containing fly ash showing a 42% reduction in emissions compared to the mix without fly ash. This research emphasizes the necessity for the Indonesian construction industry to adopt sustainable practices, including optimized mix designs and the use of low-carbon materials such as fly ash. In doing so, significant reductions in the carbon footprint of concrete can be achieved, contributing to the global efforts to mitigate climate change and to promote sustainability in construction practices.</description>

      <title>A Review of Algae-Based Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (Algae-Based CCUS)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/gases4040024</link>
      <description>Guihe Li, Jia Yao, Gases. 4(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405029254

                Excessive emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2), have garnered worldwide attention due to their significant environmental impacts. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) techniques have emerged as effective solutions to address CO2 emissions. Recently, direct air capture (DAC) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) have been advanced within the CCUS framework as negative emission technologies. BECCS, which involves cultivating biomass for energy production, then capturing and storing the resultant CO2 emissions, offers cost advantages over DAC. Algae-based CCUS is integral to the BECCS framework, leveraging algae&#8217;s biological processes to capture and sequester CO2 while simultaneously contributing to energy production and potentially achieving net negative carbon emissions. Algae&#8217;s high photosynthetic efficiency, rapid growth rates, and ability to grow in non-arable environments provide significant advantages over other BECCS methods. This comprehensive review explores recent innovations in algae-based CCUS technologies, focusing on the mechanisms of carbon capture, utilization, and storage through algae. It highlights advancements in algae cultivation for efficient carbon capture, algae-based biofuel production, and algae-based dual carbon storage materials, as well as key challenges that need to be addressed for further optimization. This review provides valuable insights into the potential of algae-based CCUS as a key component of global carbon reduction strategies.</description>

      <title>CO2&#8208;Promoted Reactions: A Prosperous Strategy for Conversion of Functional Group in Organic Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202401834</link>
      <description>Shouxin Zhang, Chanjuan Xi, ChemCatChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405036530

                Due to its non&#8208;toxic nature, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and natural abundance, carbon dioxide (CO2) is increasingly recognized as a valuable C1 source in organic synthesis. In addition to the building block for molecular construction, the role of CO2 as a promoter or catalyst to enhance reaction rates and selectivity is gaining attention. Acting as a reversible covalent Lewis acid, CO2 can function as an activating group in the transformation of various compounds, such as alcohols and amines, facilitating the dissociation of hydroxyl or activation of amino. It can also modulate the reactivity of nucleophilic reagents, including H2O, N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs), cyanide (CN), and nucleophilic reductants like borohydride (BH4&#8208;). When CO2 interacts with these nucleophiles, it can exhibit Br&#248;nsted acidity or hydrogen&#8208;bond donating capabilities and can also act as a coordinating ligand to transition metals in its carboxylate form (&#8208;CO2&#8208;). In this review, we mainly summarize and classify the synthetic applications and mechanistic insights of CO2&#8208;promoted reactions according to different functional groups and bonding types, which include: CO2&#8208;promoted functional transformation of alcohols; CO2&#8208;promoted functional transformation of amines; CO2&#8211;promoted reactions in protic solvent; CO2&#8208;promoted reactions via adducts of CO2 and nucleophiles; CO2&#8208;promoted reductive reaction.</description>

Human activity, including agricultural one, leadstosignifi cant production of greenhouse gases, among which &#1057;-CO2 occupies a dominant position. Cultivation of sugar beet in the Central Black-Earth Region takes a great quantity of &#1057;-CO2 from atmosphere forming carbohydrate compounds that allows considering sugar beet agrocenosis as a carbon stock. Main agrotechnical methods, though evolving some &#1057;-CO2 quantity, do not able to exceed its absorption by main product. This is the evidence of the fact that, in sugar beet industry, carbonic acid gas emission is somewhat lower than the stock. Maintainance ofhumus state, application of rational fertilizer doses, reduction of organic fertilizers&#8217; mineralization, and plowing of after-harvesting and root residues of sugar beet and preceding crops in soil promotes decrease of carbon dioxide emission from beet agrocenoses.</description>

                Iran ranks among the 20 most polluted countries globally, with a significant portion of carbon dioxide emissions stemming from fossil fuel-burning power plants. While these emissions are often associated with electricity generation, this study focuses on an overlooked source: the electricity distribution system within cities. Operational teams responsible for outage elimination, maintenance, and asset development&#8212;such as transformers and meters&#8212;contribute to emissions by relying on vehicles that navigate congested urban traffic. This research examines economic factors including development coefficients, failure rates, geographic conditions, inflation, and maintenance costs to optimise carbon dioxide emissions in three key sectors: outage elimination, maintenance, and development. Using sensitivity analysis of these parameters from 2016 to 2020, we quantified and proposed reductions in CO2 emissions across these activities. Additionally, a comparison of failure and maintenance rates identifies the processes with lower emissions. The findings provide a framework for optimising urban electricity distribution systems, offering insights into mitigating pollution at the distribution level and improving environmental sustainability in megacities.</description>

                The actual climate crisis is forcing the development of new energy sources that mitigate the negative effects of the climate change. Because of that, the use of fossil fuels is expected to be significantly reduced in the coming decades. In this scenario, the production of renewable fuels that reduce the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) is one of the main world challenges. The present study focuses on synthetic gas production using carbon dioxide from the cement industry, and green hydrogen, simulating the process using Aspen to address the technical and economic viability of the synthetic gas production. Advanced techniques such as the calcium looping and oxycombustion were used to efficiently capture CO2 and generate a renewable fuel with a reduced carbon footprint. Moreover, the integration into the existing infrastructure in Spain optimizes the operational efficiency of the project. A detailed technical-economic analysis was carried out to evaluate the feasibility and associated costs, as well as a sustainability analysis that includes all the production steps from the CO2 capture to the use of synthetic gas, with the aim of quantifying the reductions in GHG. The versatility and adaptability of this research allows adjustments according to market demand and external conditions. Because of that, this research is expected to contribute significantly to sustainable development by providing an innovative solution for carbon capture and clean energy generation.</description>

      <title>Exposure of Primary Human Skin Fibroblasts to Carbon Dioxide-Containing Solution Significantly Reduces TGF-&#946;-Induced Myofibroblast Differentiation In Vitro</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms252313013</link>
      <description>Maxine Fleckner, Niklas K. D&#246;hmen, Katharina Salz, Till Christophers, Joachim Windolf, Christoph V. Suschek, Lisa Oezel, International Journal of Molecular Sciences. 25(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404960390

                Wound healing as a result of a skin injury involves a series of dynamic physiological processes, leading to wound closure, re-epithelialization, and the remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The primary scar formed by the new ECM never fully regains the original tissue&#8217;s strength or flexibility. Moreover, in some cases, due to dysregulated fibroblast activity, proliferation, and differentiation, the normal scarring can be replaced by pathological fibrotic tissue, leading to hypertrophic scars or keloids. These disorders can cause significant physical impairment and psychological stress and represent significant challenges in medical management in the wound-healing process. The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of exogenously applied carbon dioxide (CO2) on fibroblast behavior, focusing on viability, proliferation, migration, and differentiation to myofibroblasts. We found that CO2 exposure for up to 60 min did not significantly affect fibroblast viability, apoptosis rate, or proliferation and migration capacities. However, a notable finding was the significant reduction in &#945;-smooth muscle actin (&#945;-SMA) protein expression, indicative of myofibroblast differentiation inhibition, following CO2 exposure. This effect was specific to CO2 and concentration as well as time-dependent, with longer exposure durations leading to greater reductions in &#945;-SMA expression. Furthermore, the inhibition of myofibroblast differentiation correlated with a statistically significantly reduced glycolytic and mitochondrial energy metabolism, and as a result, with a reduced ATP synthesis rate. This very noticeable decrease in cellular energy levels seemed to be specific to CO2 exposure and could not be observed in the control cultures using nitrogen (N2)-saturated solutions, indicating a unique and hypoxia-independent effect of CO2 on fibroblast metabolism. These findings suggest that exogenously applied CO2 may possess fibroblast differentiation-reducing properties by modulating fibroblast&#8217;s energy metabolism and could offer new therapeutic options in the prevention of scar and keloid development.</description>

                In response to the issues of air pollution, temperature, and noise, this project attempts to create an air quality, temperature, and noise monitoring system using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This system will comprise physical components and a web platform that delivers real-time environmental reports. Users can readily obtain information regarding air quality, temperature, and noise levels via this platform, which takes advantage of the internet's accessibility. This Internet of Things-based device monitors environmental quality in six high-traffic areas in Malang, Indonesia. The system uses various sensors to monitor air quality, temperature, humidity, dust levels, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and noise pollution in real-time. Data was collected during peak traffic hours, demonstrating the direct influence of car emissions on air quality. The findings show that some regions' CO and particulate matter levels surpass safe criteria, notably during peak traffic periods, but CO2, humidity, and noise levels are below acceptable norms. These findings highlight the necessity for urban air pollution reduction initiatives. Additional sensor calibration and communication modifications are recommended to increase system accuracy and dependability. This study gives significant insights for local authorities to manage urban environmental quality and safeguard human health.</description>

      <title>An Assessment of the Performance and Emissions of an Otto Power Generator Group Operating with Wet Ethanol at a High Volumetric Compression Ratio</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17236187</link>

                This work presents an experimental study of the performance and emissions of an internal combustion engine operating in the Otto cycle with a high volumetric compression ratio (17:1). The engine was initially fueled with the standard ethanol used in Brazil, with 7% distilled water (E93W07); we then studied the effects of using different ethanol-in-water mixtures, or &#8216;wet ethanol&#8217;, with 17%, 27%, 37%, and 47% distilled water concentrations. The tests were carried out with power loads of 5.0&#8211;25.0 kW at 5.0 kW intervals and with power loads of 27.5&#8211;35.0 kW at 2.5 kW intervals, whether by adding up the loads or by taking them away. The ignition timing was changed to evaluate each load imposed on the engine to avoid knocking. Specific fuel consumption (SFC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), carbon dioxide emissions (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and total hydrocarbon content (THC), as well as the internal pressure in the cylinder and the heat release rate, were measured, and the results are compared. The results show a reduction in CO and NOx and an increase in THC emissions. However, there were no significant changes in CO2 emissions when the distilled water percentage in ethanol increased. Regarding the brake thermal efficiency, it was observed that it remained approximately constant for all blends, with the same load being applied to the engine shaft, reaching a maximum value of 35%. The results obtained confirm the technical feasibility of operating an internal combustion engine in the Otto cycle with a high volumetric compression ratio using ethanol with up to 47% distilled water without significant loss of performance.</description>

Dependency of the human race on trees for food, timber, fuel wood, fodder, fiber and non-timber products has been in evidence since the pre-historic times. Apart from human utilization, trees are an important part of the ecosystem and help in carbon sequestration, climate change mitigation, converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into oxygen (O2), soil conservation, habitat for wildlife and human recreation. Many of the traditional medicine systems give much importance to the therapeutic potential of medicinal trees. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 80% of the global population relies on such traditional knowledge systems. Severe anthropogenic pressures such as rapid deforestation, change in land use patterns, over-exploitation, invasive species and climate change have resulted in reductions of these plant genetic resources. Biotechnological tools such as plant tissue culture offer an alternative method for successful mass multiplication and clonal propagation of superior and elite tree genotypes. Clonal propagation of trees provides a rapid means for producing planting stock for reforestation, afforestation and plantation programmes and conservation of rare, endangered and threatened plant genetic resources. The present chapter is an attempt at making a comprehensive study on the development of in vitro regeneration protocols of some of the important medicinal tree species and highlighting their significance, challenges in tree micropropagation and future prospects</description>

                Abstract. Developing effective global strategies for climate mitigation requires an independent assessment of green-house gas emission inventory at the urban scale. In the framework of the Dutch Ruisdael Observatory infrastructure project, we have enhanced the Dutch Large-Eddy Simulation (DALES) model to simulate carbon dioxide (CO2) plume emission and three-dimensional dispersion within the turbulent boundary layer. The unique ability to explicitly resolve turbulent structures at the hectometer resolution (100 m) makes DALES particularly suitable for detailed realistic simulations of both singular high-emitting point sources and urban emissions, aligning with the goals of Ruisdael Observatory. The model setup involves a high-resolution simulation (100 m &#215; 100 m) covering the main urban area of the Netherlands (51.5&#176;&#8211;52.5&#176; N, 3.75&#176;&#8211;6.45&#176; E). The model integrates meteorological forcing from the HARMONIE-AROME weather forecasting model, background CO2 levels from the CAMS reanalysis, as well as point source emissions and downscaled area emissions derived from 1 km &#215; 1 km emission inventory from the national registry. The latter are prepared using a sector-specific downscaling workflow, covering major emission categories. Biogenic CO2 exchanges from grasslands and forests are interactively included in the hectometer calculations within the heterogeneous land-surface model of DALES. Our evaluation strategy is twofold, comparing DALES simulations with: (i) the state-of-the art LOTOS-EUROS model simulations and (ii) in-situ Cabauw tower measurements and Ruisdael surface observations of the urban background in the Rotterdam area at Westmaas and Slufter. Our comprehensive statistical analysis confirmed the effectiveness of DALES in modeling the urban-scale CO2 emission distribution and plume dispersion under turbulent conditions, but also revealed potential limitations and areas for further improvement. Thus, our new model framework provides valuable insights into emission transport and dispersion of CO2, in support of emission uncertainty reduction using atmospheric measurements and the development of effective climate policies.</description>

      <title>Ghana's electric vehicle policy: a path to aviation industry decarbonization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.56049/jghie.v24i3.195</link>
      <description>God'sable Sitsofe Koku Aidam, Eunice Akyereko Adjei, Richard Opoku, David Kofi Oppong, William Gyamerah Agyare, Journal of the Ghana Institution of Engineering (JGhIE). 24(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405042661

                The International Energy Agency reports a surge of over 250 million tons in global carbon dioxide emissions from the transportation sector in 2022, reaching close to 8 gigatons, predominantly fuelled by increased passenger and cargo activities post the COVID-19 pandemic. The aviation sector, constituting 3% of human-induced CO2 emissions, played a pivotal role in this surge, highlighting the urgent need for transformative measures. The urgency of decarbonizing the aviation sector, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa is underscored, considering its projected contribution to global carbon emissions and the lack of policies to adopt green technologies in the African aviation industry. The paper delves into the transformative impact of Electric Vehicle (EV) in aviation, highlighting the potential of EV adoption in ground operations and emphasizing the need for a robust charging infrastructure. Drawing insights from global case studies, the paper underscores the feasibility and benefits of EV adoption in the aviation industry. Ghana's EV Policy emerges as a pioneering force in the aviation industry's journey towards decarbonization. By strategically harnessing the policy's momentum and lithium resources, Ghana can position itself as a leader in adopting sustainable technologies, contributing to broader international efforts for a greener future in air travel. The National EV Policy should therefore be actively implemented, fostering a phased transition to EVs in the transportation sector to achieve emission reduction goals by 2045. Collaboration between the government and stakeholders should be strengthened to ensure the successful integration of EVs into Ghana's aviation, aligning with global trends for a sustainable and environmentally friendly aviation sector.</description>

      <title>Effect of Infectious Disease Risk Management on Indoor Environmental Quality in Lecture Rooms: Current Performance and Future Considerations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su162310792</link>
      <description>Adam O&#8217;Donovan, F Delaney, Ta&#239;na Ouvrard, Pierre A. Geoffroy, Paul D. O&#8217;Sullivan, Sustainability. 16(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405184789

                The global COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant and accelerated developments in ventilation practises, where the need to ventilate buildings has been put centre stage. Longer-term ventilation approaches are now more likely to utilise hybrid ventilation strategies to address the challenge of ensuring resilient indoor thermal environments that are carbon neutral while also minimising the risk of long-range airborne infectious spread of viral pathogens. In the short term, there are many existing buildings which may not undergo retrofit for some time, and consequently, risk mitigation strategies have been implemented in these buildings by utilising existing systems. This paper will present an indoor environmental quality evaluation of ten university lecture rooms both before, during and after changes in ventilation management behaviour and systems that were accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate a mean reduction in internal carbon dioxide levels of between 46% and 67% when pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 datasets are compared and between 11% and 62% when pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 datasets are compared. Changes in behaviour and systems have reduced the time spent above thresholds conducive to virus growth by between 8% and 54%, depending on the lecture room. Despite this, a &#8220;rebound&#8221; can be observed in many rooms, with CO2 levels appearing to be trending toward pre-pandemic levels. This work indicates the effect of behavioural and system changes on ventilation and the potential risk for virus spread. The results indicate a need to retrofit existing lecture rooms with more advanced natural or mechanical systems to ensure consistent indoor environmental quality.</description>

      <title>Low-carbon integrated energy system optimization dispatch considering wind and solar uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0231114</link>

                In efforts to mitigate global warming, reducing greenhouse gas emissions represented by carbon dioxide, this paper introduces a stepped carbon trading mechanism for local Integrated Energy Systems (IES) that are not yet engaged in carbon trading markets as a tool for carbon emission rights trading. To minimize both overall system costs and carbon trading expenses, we propose a refined Power-to-Gas (P2G) model that includes a waste heat recovery process. In addition, all gas-fired units within the IES are retrofitted to support low-carbon operations, and a coupled operation mode of carbon capture power plants and P2G is introduced. To manage uncertainties in wind and solar power output, Latin hypercube sampling and K-means clustering methods are employed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling strategy significantly reduces system operating costs while realizing an &#8764;16.2% reduction in carbon emissions.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective cropping pattern optimization and comparative assessment with the food-energy-water nexus</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2166/ws.2024.254</link>
      <description>Volkan Hac&#305;s&#252;leyman, Mehmet &#214;zger, Water Science &amp; Technology Water Supply. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405199172

                ABSTRACT Agriculture is the largest consumer of water, accounting for nearly 70% of global freshwater consumption, and it also uses about 30% of the world's energy. This creates an increasing challenge for the efficient use of water and energy resources while adequately meeting food demand. Therefore, understanding the interrelations between food, energy, and water resources is crucial. In this study, a multi-objective linear programming model was employed to identify alternative scenarios for optimal cropping areas that minimize water use in agriculture and maximize agricultural income. Different weight coefficients were assigned to these objective functions to generate various cropping scenarios. Once the optimal cropping patterns for each scenario were determined, parameters such as water use, energy requirements, agricultural revenue, and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated based on the food-energy-water nexus. The results for each alternative crop pattern scenario were then analyzed. The results indicate that prioritizing the objective of minimizing water use leads to an average reduction of 3.35% in water use, 1.18% in energy demand, and 0.26% in carbon dioxide emissions, while agricultural income increases by an average of 1% compared to the base scenario. Conversely, when maximizing agricultural income is prioritized, there is an average increase of 2.05% in agricultural income.</description>

      <title>A new low carbon scheduling method for source load multi time scale in power systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2896/1/012037</link>
      <description>Fei Zhao, Li Yang, Jiaxi Chen, Jiting Gu, Li Pan, Journal of Physics Conference Series. 2896(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404996816

                Abstract The impact of global climate change caused by carbon dioxide emissions on human production and life is becoming increasingly severe. New energy sources, led by wind and solar power, have become the backbone of reducing carbon emissions. The main focus of this article is to develop advantages such as multi-energy complementarity, efficient integration, flexibility and stability, and low-carbon environmental protection. While meeting the diverse energy needs of the energy consumption side, it is necessary to reasonably allocate resources on the energy supply side and effectively absorb renewable energy. To begin with, this paper develops a multi-time-scale economic dispatch model for a holistic energy system, focusing on collaborative carbon reduction between energy sources and loads. The upper layer serves as a long-term energy scheduling mechanism, dynamically updating electricity prices and conveying them to the lower layer model. The lower layer functions as a short-term energy scheduling component, directing load management according to electricity prices and providing feedback on the load plan to the upper layer model. Both the upper and lower-layer models strive to minimize the overall operational costs as their primary objective. Secondly, the probability distribution of wind and photovoltaic power is discretized using sequence operation theory. The CPLEX is used to solve the above model. Finally, taking a comprehensive energy system as an example, the impact of source load side carbon reduction measures on the system scheduling results under multiple time scales is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Zero-Gap Electrolyzers Accelerate Reconstruction of Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-Derived Catalysts under CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction</title>

                To scale carbon dioxide reduction (CO2R), establishing a structure&#8211;property&#8211;performance relationship of the catalyst under the reaction conditions is a priority. Particularly in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzers, knowledge about the valence state and coordination environment of the catalyst is of value yet limited. We developed an MEA electrolyzer that utilizes X-ray absorption spectroscopy to investigate the structural evolution of Cu2O-derived catalysts under CO2R and compare the same catalysts in a flow cell. Additionally, we study the influence of CO reduction and incorporating Ag on the reconstruction of the catalyst. We find that the strong reduction environment in the MEA and feeding CO leads to reconstruction of Cu2O particles, favoring higher coordination and lower oxidation states, which coincides with a shift in the reaction selectivity from C2+ to hydrogen. Conversely, incorporating small amounts of Ag in the catalyst restricts the reconstruction. These findings advocate for in situ studies in zero-gap electrolyzers.</description>

                Abstract In 2022, shipping was responsible for around 706 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, up 5% from 2020 and back to 2017-2018 levels. To accelerate the energy transition and reduce emissions in this sector, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set ambitious goals requiring all stakeholders&#8217; radical actions. Several solutions have been proposed such as cruise speed reduction, on-board installation of a Carbon Capture and Storage system, use of low/zero carbon fuels in conventional internal combustion engines, and introduction or replacement of the main and auxiliary engines with novel technologies. Thanks to their high energy conversion efficiency, and reduced environmental impact, the interest in fuel cell-based systems for shipping propulsion has been rising in the last few years. In this work, the replacement of fossil fuel-based marine engines with fuel cell technology is analysed from technical and environmental points of view. A preliminary technical assessment, aiming at defining different powertrain configurations, is performed by starting from the characterization of the selected ships, in terms of installed power, navigation routes, and load profiles. The feasibility of the proposed solutions is evaluated by considering the fuel consumption and the emissions avoided with respect to the conventional solutions.</description>

                The main goal of this review paper is to show the advantages and challenges of photovoltaic cells/modules/panels and scintillators towards carbon footprint reduction for ecological safety. Briefly, the various types of solar-driven CO2 conversion processes are shown as a new concept of CO2 reduction. The health toxicity and environmental effects of scintillators, along with risks associated with use and disposal, are presented, taking into consideration inorganic and organic materials. Factors affecting the durability and lifespan of scintillators and the carbon footprint of solar cell production are analysed, considering CO2 emission. Moreover, the technology of recycling photovoltaic modules and scintillators, along with a SWOT analysis of scintillation material toxicity, is presented to find the best solutions for clean technology and ecological safety. Finally, we offer recommendations for the areas where the most significant reductions in CO2 emissions are expected to be implemented in the future of green energy in industry, including ESG strategies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Energy Efficiency in Integrated Electrolyser Stack and Methanation Reactor Systems Through Pinch Analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/reactions5040051</link>
      <description>Miguel Oliveira, Amadeu Borges, Reactions. 5(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405072614

                This study uses the application of Pinch analysis to optimize an integrated electrolyzer and methanation system, a promising approach for producing green hydrogen and synthetic natural gas (SNG). By leveraging renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, electrolysis is used to produce hydrogen, which reacts with captured carbon dioxide in the methanation reactor to form methane. This process not only allows for efficient energy storage but also supports the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. A key focus of this study is the optimization of thermal energy flows within the system, which has not been extensively addressed in the literature. Pinch analysis was applied to identify the critical Pinch point, which revealed the temperature at which the most efficient heat recovery could be achieved. The design of a tailored heat exchanger network led to significant improvements, including a 66.45% reduction in hot utility consumption and an 18.85% reduction in cold utility demand. Overall, the system achieved global energy savings of 31.02%. These results were compared with the existing literature, demonstrating that our approach offers comparable or superior utility savings while addressing challenges, such as the complexity of chemical reactions and system integration. This research highlights the potential for substantial operational cost reductions and increasing sustainability in industrial applications, contributing to the advancement of renewable energy technologies and the decarbonization of energy systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of Urban Spatial Compactness on Carbon Emissions: Heterogeneity at the County Level in the Beijing&#8211;Tianjin&#8211;Hebei Area, China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/land13122104</link>
      <description>Muhan Li, Mingzhang Zuo, S.Q. Chen, Shuang Tang, Tian Chen, Jia Liu, Land. 13(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405073950

                Urban spatial compactness is crucial for reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable urban development. However, the potential of and variations in spatial compactness in county-level carbon reduction have been largely overlooked. Taking the county-level areas in the Beijing&#8211;Tianjin&#8211;Hebei (BTH) region as an example, after reviewing the dimensions, scales, and pathways of the existing research, we quantifies the spatial compactness from 2005 to 2015 in terms of density, morphology, and function. The results reveal that, firstly, BTH county-level areas&#8217; carbon emissions, both per land area (CO2/L) and per capita (CO2/P), have generally risen. Heterogeneity varied across spatial compactness indicators: urban density and functional compactness increased, while morphological compactness showed a minor fluctuation. Second, the correlations with CO2/L were stronger than those with CO2/P, ranking from urban density, functional compactness &gt; morphological compactness. Additionally, the geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) model revealed the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the impact of spatial compactness on carbon emission intensity. The heterogeneity results provide insights into the mechanisms and general patterns of the differences in the factors influencing carbon emissions in four different types of county-level areas, namely, central, eastern, southern, and northwestern, offering policy guidance to promote the reductions in both CO2/L and CO2/P. This study is helpful for proposing urban spatial planning strategies for carbon reduction and formulating differentiated carbon reduction policies.</description>

      <title>Thermal Protection Analysis of Hypersonic Reentry Nose Cone with Multi-Row Disk Spike Using Lateral Single/Multi Jets: A Computational Investigation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4067366</link>
      <description>Hanting Gao, Dan Zhu, Journal of Fluids Engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405141836

                Abstract This research examines the efficacy of employing lateral multi jets to decrease thermal effects on the blunt body featuring a multi-row disk spike, which holds significant importance in the design of high-speed vehicles. The main novelty of the model is the combination of the spike with Multiple row disk along with the injection of the coolant jet. The study thoroughly analyzes the cooling mechanism of lateral jets and assesses the influence of coolant jet positioning on heat reduction of the nose and mechanical spike. This study employed RANS equations with SST turbulence model for the simulation of the high-speed flow around the nose cone with Multi-Row Disk Spike. A comparison is made between the effectiveness of CO2 and helium jets, both as single and multiple injectors. The results display that a single CO2 jet released near the tip of the spike is the most effective, and placing the lateral coolant injector away from the main body effectively manages aerodynamic heating. Additionally, the research compares the heat load reduction achieved by triple lateral jets and concludes that the CO2 jet is the most efficient option for thermal protection of the main body. The role of the spike in reduction of the heat load is reduced 20% when CO2 jet is released from all lateral injectors.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Production of Green Oxy-Hydrogen from Vehicles&#8217; Air Conditioning Drains to Enhance Engine Efficiency and Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/hydrogen5040051</link>
      <description>Mohamed K. M. Gerwash, Amin M. K. Al-ghonemy, M.A. Omara, Ibrahim Ahmed, Aly Saeed, Gamal B. Abdelaziz, Hydrogen. 5(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405071904

                Innovative and sustainable solutions are increasingly necessary as concerns about fossil fuels&#8217; environmental and economic impacts grow. Accordingly, this study aims to enhance vehicle internal combustion engine efficiency by producing oxy-hydrogen (HHO) from drain water from the vehicle air conditioning system and utilizing it as a secondary fuel. A 1600 cc Daewoo engine equipped with electronic fuel injection was employed as the test subject. Initially, the engine&#8217;s performance was evaluated using various gasoline variants, 80, 92, and 95. The 92-octane gasoline demonstrated the highest efficiency, achieving a peak power of 113 kW and torque of 190 Nm. The engine had an 11:1 compression ratio. Then, different flow rates of oxy-hydrogen, 50, 248, 397, and 480 mL/min, generated from the air conditioner drain were combined with 92 fuel. A significant improvement was observed with the increase in the flow rate of oxy-hydrogen gas to the 92 fuel. The results indicated that incorporating 480 mL/min oxy-hydrogen gas into the fuel led to an 8.7% reduction in fuel consumption, 5.5% enhancement in thermal efficiency, and 7.9% in volumetric efficiency. Greenhouse gas emissions reductions of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrocarbons were recorded as 18%, 9.2%, and 9%, respectively. At the same time, nitrogen oxides increased by 12.5%. Therefore, utilizing a vehicle air conditioner drain water to generate oxy-hydrogen gas fuel in conjunction with 92-octane gasoline is an efficient solution to reduce fuel consumption, enhance energy efficiency, and mitigate the adverse effects of pollution. This approach also contributes to progress towards a more sustainable future.</description>

      <description>Bradie S. Crandall, Matt S. Naughton, Soyeon Park, Jia Yu, Chunyan Zhang, Shima Mahtabian, Kaiying Wang, Xinhua Liang, Kun Fu, Feng Jiao, Nature Communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404995085

                The conversion of CO2 emissions into valuable 3D printed carbon-based materials offers a transformative strategy for climate mitigation and resource utilization. Here, we 3D print carbon nanocomposites from CO2 using an integrated system that electrochemically converts CO2 into CO, followed by a thermocatalytic process that synthesizes carbon nanotubes (CNTs) which are then 3D printed into high-density carbon nanocomposites. A 200 cm2 electrolyzer stack is integrated with a thermochemical reactor for more than 45 h of operation, cumulatively synthesizing 37 grams of CNTs from CO2. A techno-economic analysis indicates a 90% cost reduction in CNT production on an industrial scale compared to current benchmarks, underscoring the commercial viability of the system. A 3D printing process is developed that achieves a high nanocomposite CNT concentration (38 wt%) while enhancing composite structural attributes via CNT alignment. With the rapidly rising demand for carbon nanocomposites, this CO2-to-nanocomposite process can make a substantial impact on global carbon emission reduction efforts. This work develops a method to sequester carbon emissions into valuable 3D printed materials. By combining a reactor cascade with advanced additive manufacturing, this system offers the ability for carbon utilization at scale, a crucial step for addressing climate change.</description>

      <title>Greening the Corn Belt: Low-carbon-intensity ammonia&#8217;s role in the future of sustainable corn production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0227022</link>
      <description>Mariam Arzumanyan, Ning Lin, Haoying Wang, Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy. 16(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404997861

                Ammonia production is a significant source of carbon emissions globally, particularly in the agricultural sector, where it is extensively used as a fertilizer. This research suggests a potential avenue to reduce the carbon footprint of corn production for biofuels in the US Corn Belt. Conventional methods of producing nitrogenous fertilizers derived from ammonia are responsible for the highest CO2 emissions in the life cycle of corn production. We estimate that the total CO2 emissions can be reduced from 3.09 kg CO2 to 2.07 kg CO2 per bushel of corn (33% reduction) when conventional ammonia is replaced with green ammonia. If conventional ammonia is replaced with blue ammonia with carbon capture and storage, the total CO2 emissions can be reduced from 3.09 kg CO2 to 2.27 kg CO2 per bushel of corn (26% reduction). Despite these environmental benefits, our economic analysis reveals that even with policy incentives such as the 45Q and 45V tax credits, low-carbon-intensity ammonia is not yet cost-competitive with conventional ammonia. Renewable (green) ammonia, for instance, remains significantly more expensive at $532 (2024 US Dollar) per metric ton with 45V incentives compared to conventional ammonia at $249 per metric ton. Blue ammonia, even with the 45Q credit, costs $289 per metric ton&#8212;still higher than conventional ammonia. However, when a tiered carbon tax of $85 per ton of CO2 is applied to conventional ammonia, raising its cost to $326 per metric ton, blue ammonia becomes cost-competitive, but green ammonia still lags behind. This highlights the need for carbon pricing policies to enable the shift toward lower-carbon ammonia production, as tax credits alone are insufficient to close the cost gap.</description>

                Abstract Replacing diesel with biodiesel generally results in a decrease in exhaust emissions like carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, particulate matter, and carbon dioxide. However, nitrogen oxide emissions show increasing trends. On the other hand, a decrease in nitrogen oxide emissions has been found using various additives with diesel and biodiesel blends. In this work the experimentations are carried out on diesel, B30 (70% v/v diesel+30% v/v biodiesel), and the B30CL1000 (70% v/v diesel+30% v/v biodiesel+1000 ppm clove oil) to evaluate the performance and emissions of diesel engine. The Response Surface Methodology based approach has been applied to evaluate the effect of different engine operating parameters on engine performance and emission while fueled with the B30CL1000 fuel blend. Further, the Analytic Hierarchy Process - Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment method has been applied to identify the optimal setting of the parameters and rank the optimal engine operating range for the B30CL1000 blend. From results, elicited that the accumulation of 1000 ppm of antioxidant (clove oil) additives in the B30 blend resulted in a reduction in the brake-specific fuel consumption by up to 11.5% at higher loads. Brake thermal efficiency increased by 16.3% at low load conditions for the B30CL1000 blend. After that the B30CL1000 blend showed a 2% drop in carbon monoxide emission at higher loads and the decreased nitrogen oxide emission for the B30CL1000 blend has been also reported as 12% at low loads and 2% at higher loads which follows a similar trend as exhaust gas temperature. The 5th experimental run having CR (17), EGR (0%) and Load (12kg) has been ranked as 1.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the quality and mechanical properties of metal layers from low-carbon steel obtained by the WAAM method with the use of additional using additional mechanical and ultrasonic processing</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.17212/1994-6309-2024-26.4-75-91</link>
      <description>Yu I Karlina, V Yu Konyukhov, T.M. Oparina, Metal Working and Material Science. 26(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405195843

                Introduction. Additive manufacturing is a technology that enables three-dimensional (3D) components to be printed layer by layer according to digital models. Completely different from traditional manufacturing methods such as casting, forging, and machining, additive manufacturing is a near net shape manufacturing process that can greatly enhance design freedom and reduce manufacturing runtime. The material processing challenges in Wire and Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) are related to achieving performance metrics related to geometric, physical, and material properties. Tight tolerances and stringent surface integrity requirements cannot be achieved by utilizing stand-alone AM technologies. Therefore, WAAM parts typically require some post-processing to meet requirements related to surface finish, dimensional tolerances and mechanical properties. It is therefore not surprising that the integration of AM with post-processing technologies into single and multi-setup machining solutions, commonly referred to as hybrid AM, has become a very attractive proposition for industry. The purpose of the work is to evaluate the quality and mechanical properties of the resulting metal layers of mild steel by WAAM method using additional mechanical and ultrasonic processing. Research Methods. To conduct the experiments, a set of welding equipment was used &#8212; a single-phase inverter device KEMPPI Kempomat 1701, designed for welding with wire in shielding gases. A mixture of argon and carbon dioxide (80 % argon and 20 % CO2) was used as a shielding gas. SV-08G2S (0.8 C-2 Mg-Si) wire was used as the surfacing material. A plate made of steel St3 with overall dimensions 150&#215;100&#215;5 mm was used as a base for surfacing. The surface of the plate before surfacing was thoroughly cleaned from the layer of oxides, oil, rust and other contaminants. For this purpose mechanical cleaning of the surface was used with BOSCH abrasive wheel with a diameter of 125 mm diameter and a grit size of 120. Before surfacing the surface of the product was degreased with white spirit. The gas flow rate was set at 8 dm3/min. To select the optimal wire feed rate and volt-ampere characteristic, surfacing was performed at each adjustment step of wire feed rate, and voltage. Mechanical statistical tensile tests, chemical composition analysis and metallographic studies were also performed. Results and Discussion. Gas porosity is a typical defect that occurs during the WAAM process and should be eliminated because it adversely affects the mechanical properties. Initially, gas porosity leads to a reduction in the mechanical strength of the part due to damage from microcrack formation. In addition, it often causes the surfaced layer to have worse fatigue properties due to the spatial distribution of different shape and size structures. In our experiments we found that a wire feed speed range of 5&#8211;6 m/min is optimal. Increasing the flow rate of shielding gas in the range of 8&#8211;14 l/min allows reducing porosity in the surfaced metal to almost zero. The mechanical properties of the surfaced beads show that the average value of yield strength after machining is higher than that of unprocessed specimens. The data obtained from these experiments are in good agreement with those reported in the literature. The presented results can be used in real WAAM technological processes.</description>

      <title>Optimizing cover crop practices as a sustainable solution for global agroecosystem services</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54536-z</link>
      <description>Tianyi Qiu, Yu Shi, Josep Pe&#241;uelas, Ji Liu, Qingliang Cui, Jordi Sardans, Feng Zhou, Longlong Xia, Weiming Yan, Shuling Zhao, Shushi Peng, Jinshi Jian, Qinsi He, Wenju Zhang, Min Huang, Wenfeng Tan, Linchuan Fang, Nature Communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405089766

                The practice of cover crops has gained popularity as a strategy to improve agricultural sustainability, but its full potential is often limited by environmental trade-offs. Using meta-analytic and data-driven quantifications of 2302 observations, we optimized cover crop practices and evaluated their benefits for global agroecosystems. Cover crops have historically boosted crop yields, soil carbon storage, and stability, but also stimulated greenhouse gas emissions. However, combining them with long-term implementation (five years or more) and climate-smart practices (such as no-tillage) can enhance these services synergistically. A biculture of legume and non-legume cover crops, terminated 25 days before planting the next crop and followed by residue mulching, is the optimal portfolio. Such optimized practices are projected to increase agroecosystem multiservices by 1.25%, equivalent to annual gains of 97.7 million metric tons in crop production, 21.7 billion metric tons in carbon dioxide sequestration, and 2.41 billion metric tons in soil erosion reduction. By 2100, the continued implementation of optimized practices could mitigate climate-related yield losses and contribute to climate neutrality and soil stabilization, especially in harsh and underdeveloped areas. These findings underscore the promising potential of optimized cover crop practices to achieve the synergy in food security and environmental protection. Cover crops can improve agricultural sustainability. In this meta-analysis, the authors find that a biculture of legume and non-legume cover crops is optimal and may promote multiple agroecosystem services while mitigating climate-related yield losses by 2100.</description>

      <title>Research on Industrial CO2 Emission Intensity and Its Driving Mechanism Under China&#8217;s Dual Carbon Target</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su162310785</link>

                As global climate change becomes increasingly severe, industrial CO2 emissions have received increasing attention, but the impact factors and driving mechanisms of industrial CO2 emission intensity remain unclear. Based on panel data from 2010 to 2021 in Shandong Province, a key economic region in eastern China, the industrial CO2 emission intensity under China&#8217;s dual carbon target was analyzed using multivariate ordination methods. The results showed that (1) total CO2 emissions from industry are increasing annually, with an average growth rate of 3.74%, and electricity, coal, and coke are the primary sources of CO2 emissions. (2) Total CO2 emissions originated primarily from the heavy manufacturing, energy production, and high energy intensity industry categories, and the CO2 emission intensity of different types of energy increased by 21.24% from 2010 to 2021. (3) CO2 emission intensity is significantly positively correlated with the proportion of high energy intensive industry, energy consumption intensity, and investment intensity and significantly negatively correlated with gross industrial output. In addition, the effects of different types of energy on industrial CO2 emission intensity varied, and coal, coke, electricity, and diesel oil were significantly positively correlated with CO2 emission intensity. Therefore, to reduce the CO2 emission intensity of the industrial sector in the future and to achieve China&#8217;s dual carbon target, it is necessary to adjust and optimize the industrial and energy structure, strengthen technological progress and innovation, improve energy utilization efficiency, improve and implement relevant policies for industrial carbon reduction, and then ensure the sustainable development of the economy, society, and environment.</description>

      <title>Rational engineering of a highly active and resilient &#945;&#8208;carbonic anhydrase from the hydrothermal vent species &lt;i&gt;Persephonella hydrogeniphila&lt;/i&gt;</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.17346</link>
      <description>Colleen Varaidzo Manyumwa, Chenxi Zhang, Carsten Jers, Ivan Mijakovi&#263;, FEBS Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405089468

                Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are ideal catalysts for carbon dioxide sequestration in efforts to alleviate climate change. Here, we report the characterisation of three &#945;&#8208;CAs that originate from the thermophilic bacteria Persephonella hydrogeniphila (PhyCA), Persephonella atlantica (PaCA), and Persephonella sp. KM09&#8208;Lau&#8208;8 (PlauCA) isolated from hydrothermal vents. The three &#945;&#8208;Cas, showing high sequence similarities, were produced in Escherichia coli , purified and characterised. Surprisingly, they revealed very different behaviours with regards to their thermostability profiles. PhyCA presented a more stable thermostability profile amongst the three, thus we chose it for rational engineering to improve it further. PhyCA's residue K88, a proton transfer residue in &#945;&#8208;CAs, was mutated to His, Ala, Gln and Tyr. A 4&#8208;fold activity improvement was noted for variants K88H and K88Q at 30 &#176;C, owing to the higher proton transfer efficiency of the replacement proton transfer residues. K88Q also proved more stable than PhyCA. K88Y did not increase activity, but notably increased thermal stability, with this enzyme variant retaining 50% of its initial activity after incubation for 1 h at 90 &#176;C. Removal of the two main proton shuttles (variant H85A_K88A) resulted in diminished activity of the enzyme. Molecular dynamics simulations performed for PhyCA and all its variants revealed differences in residue fluctuations, with K88A resulting in a general reduction in root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of active site residues as well as most of the CA's residues. Its specific activity and stability in turn increased compared to the wild type.</description>

      <title>A simple procedure for freezing triaxial test specimens and determining the final moisture content after liquefaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1680/jgele.24.00019</link>
      <description>Fernando A. M. Marinho, F&#225;bio Mariz Gon&#231;alves, Rodrigo Bernardo Serafim, Mariane Borba de Lemos, G&#233;otechnique Letters. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405109499

                Accurately determining the critical state line in specimens subjected to undrained triaxial tests, particularly those prone to liquefaction, relies on precise void ratio determination. Procedures exist to determine volume variations throughout all stages of the testing process until the final failure condition is reached. However, these procedures have not demonstrated the same level of accuracy as the method used for freezing the samples and subsequently determining the water content and void ratio. The conventional procedure for freezing the specimen involves placing the entire base of the triaxial system, including the tubes and valves, in a freezer. However, this process not only causes damage to the valves, requiring frequent replacement and increasing the cost of the tests but also necessitates a dedicated freezer for this specific procedure. This paper presents a simple and safe procedure for freezing specimens without detaching the base and exposing the valves and the entire system to low temperatures. The key advantage of this procedure over conventional methods is the reduction of material and time costs without compromising the accuracy of determining the void ratio. The specimen is frozen within minutes using solid carbon dioxide (dry ice), and determining water content is easily accomplished.</description>

      <title>Physiological and Biochemical Responses of Pseudocereals with C3 and C4 Photosynthetic Metabolism in an Environment with Elevated CO2</title>

                The present work aimed to investigate the effect of increasing CO2 concentration on the growth, productivity, grain quality, and biochemical changes in quinoa and amaranth plants. An experiment was conducted in open chambers (OTCs) to evaluate the responses of these species to different levels of CO2 {a[CO2] = 400 &#177; 50 &#956;mol mol&#8722;1 CO2 for ambient CO2 concentration, e[CO2] = 700 &#177; 50 &#956;mol mol&#8722;1 CO2 for the elevated CO2 concentration}. Growth parameters and photosynthetic pigments reflected changes in gas exchange, saccharolytic enzymes, and carbohydrate metabolism when plants were grown under e[CO2]. Furthermore, both species maintained most of the parameters related to gas exchange, demonstrating that the antioxidant system was efficient in supporting the primary metabolism of plants under e[CO2] conditions. Both species were taller and had longer roots and a greater dry weight of roots and shoots when under e[CO2]. On the other hand, the panicle was shorter under the same situation, indicating that the plants invested energy, nutrients, and all mechanisms in their growth to mitigate stress in expense of yield. This led to a reduction on panicle size and, ultimately, reducing quinoa grain yield. Although e[CO2] altered the plant&#8217;s metabolic parameters for amaranth, the plants managed to maintain their development without affecting grain yield. Protein levels in grains were reduced in both species under e[CO2] in the average of two harvests. Therefore, for amaranth, the increase in CO2 mainly contributes to lowering the protein content of the grains. As for quinoa, its yield performance is also affected, in addition to its protein content. These findings provide new insights into how plants C3 (amaranth) and C4 (quinoa) respond to e[CO2], significantly increasing photosynthesis and its growth but ultimately reducing yield for quinoa and protein content in both species. This result ultimately underscore the critical need to breed plants that can adapt to e[CO2] as means to mitigate its negative effects and to ensure sustainable and nutritious crop production in future environmental conditions.</description>

                While widely acknowledged as the father of the Hydrogen Economy and worthy to be dubbed as grandfather of the Methanol Economy, John O&#8217;Mara Bockris (JOMB) continued to inspire important environmental advances to the end of his most creative life. His co-invention of what may turn out to be a ground-breaking US Patent 8,413,420 helps to open the way to capturing CO2 from automotive exhausts and its conversion to recyclable methanol fuel, thereby greatly reducing and possibly even reversing global warming. Most recently, in a letter dated shortly before his death, published herein as the Appendix, JOMB pointed to inexpensive mass production of methanol from natural gas via the syngas route which may lead to the displacement of gasoline by methanol as the main automotive fuel and to major reductions in global CO2 emissions.</description>

                The present study deals with the performance evaluation of four CO2 booster refrigeration system configurations: a conventional, a parallel compressor, an ejector-based, and an NH3/CO2 cascade configuration, under the ambient conditions of the city of Bucaramanga, Colombia. Applying detailed energy and exergy analyses, as well as an evaluation of environmental impact through Total Equivalent Warming Impact (TEWI), it was identified that the ejector-based configuration as the most energy-efficient, exhibiting a 13.2% reduction in annual power consumption compared to the conventional system. The cascade configuration demonstrated the lowest exergy destruction above 26&#176;C, highlighting its potential under higher ambient temperatures. Furthermore, the ejector-based configuration consistently achieved the highest 2nd law efficiency across the temperature range set. The environmental impact analysis showed the ejector-based configuration also had the lowest TEWI, with a 14.36% reduction. The results underscore the importance of selecting appropriate refrigeration configurations based on local climate conditions.</description>

                In addition to excellent mechanical, physical and chemical parameters, magnesium oxychloride cement (MOC) composites offer numerous environmental benefits, particularly with regard to the necessary reduction of carbon dioxide emissions associated with the production of Portland cement based building materials. However, the limitation to the wider use of MOC is its low water resistance. Therefore, the possibility of improving the water resistance of magnesium oxychloride cement (MOC) composites by nano-adjustment using fluorographene (FG) was the subject of the research presented. A tannic acid (TA)-based surfactant was used to uniformly disperse the FG particles. The effect of FG added at the dosage of 0.2% and 0.5% by weight of the MOC binder in the MOC mixture was investigated and characterized by the assessment of the mechanical, basic structural and microstructural properties of the hardened composites. Particular attention was paid to the analysis of water resistance, for which the hygric parameters and the softening coefficient were measured after immersing the samples in water for 24 hours. The results obtained showed that FG in the amount of 0.2 wt% of the binder improved the water resistance, while 0.5 wt% of FG in the MOC binder gave results comparable to those of the reference sample. Since FG-doped MOC composites retained the excellent mechanical and structural parameters of MOC, the improvement in water resistance may enable them to more widely exploit their advanced properties and eco-efficiency in construction practice.</description>

                Abstract Objectives This study aims to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and labor, focusing on its effects on maternal and child health. The research explores the relationships between coronavirus infection and clinical and laboratory parameters, as well as the risks of pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes. Methods The study involved 60 pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19. A comprehensive evaluation of clinical and laboratory indicators was conducted, employing correlation, regression, logistic analyses to determine risk factors. Results There was a strong inverse correlation between carbon dioxide levels and haematocrit (&#8722;0.76), and a direct correlation between blood pH and partial pressure of oxygen (0.73). COVID-19 was associated with increased risks of preterm labor (OR=1.82), stillbirth (OR=2.11), pre-eclampsia (OR=1.46), and foetal distress. Multivariate analysis revealed a 200 g reduction in neonatal birth weight and higher risks of hospitalisation (OR=1.8), postpartum hemorrhage (OR=2.3), and preterm delivery (OR=2.5). Comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular abnormalities, diabetes, obesity, thrombophilias exacerbated the risks of complications, including pre-eclampsia, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome, venous thromboembolism. Conclusions COVID-19 infection increases the likelihood of pregnancy complications and adverse outcomes, especially in women with comorbidities. These findings highlight the need for preventive strategies and risk management protocols for pregnant women during future outbreaks, emphasizing the importance of further research in this field.</description>

      <title>Potentiality of alginate-yeast biosorbent for biogas purification</title>

      <description>Norli Ismail, Bilhate Chala, J. Mueller, Hans Oechsner, Deleted Journal. 2(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404978202

                The paper discussed the current research on the applicability of biosorbents for the purification of biogas, particularly the decrease of H2S by using encapsulated or embedded biological biomass. This study investigated the potential of alginate-yeast biosorbent (AlgY) for biogas purification, focusing on hydrogen sulfide (H2S) removal. A biogas column test was conducted to compare the biosorption efficiency of AlgY and pure alginate beads. Using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), the effects of column length, acquisition time, and biosorbent type were evaluated for CH4, CO2, and H2S removal. Results depicted significant H2S reduction, with AlgY achieving a p-value of &lt; 0.0001 and a high correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.9518). The relatively high correlation coefficient (R2) of the tested quadratic model of all the responses were recorded (R2; 0.5560, 0.5048, and 0.9518 for CH4, CO2, and H2S respectively). According to the studies&#8217; preliminary findings, the type of biosorbent has a significant role in determining the biosorption effectiveness. The ANOVA of model terms depicted a significant p-value (p &lt; 0.05) indicated a potential alginate-yeast (AlgY) biosorbent for H2S purification or reduction.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Smart Grids for Sustainable Energy Transition and Emission Reduction with Advanced Forecasting Techniques</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.46488/nept.2024.v23i04.018</link>
      <description>Mahmoud Abu-Allaban, Brahim Farou, Zineddine Kouahla, Hamid S&#233;ridi, Nature Environment and Pollution Technology. 23(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404979664

                Smart grids are modernized, intelligent electricity distribution systems that integrate information and communication technologies to improve the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of the electricity network. However, existing smart grids only integrate renewable energies when it comes to active demand management without taking into consideration the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This paper addresses this problem by forecasting CO2 emissions based on electricity consumption, making it possible to transition to renewable energies and thereby reduce CO2 emissions generated by fossil fuels. This approach contributes to the mitigation of climate change and the preservation of air quality, both of which are essential for a healthy and sustainable environment. To achieve this goal, we propose a transformer-based encoder architecture for load forecasting by modifying the transformer workflow and designing a novel technique for handling contextual features. The proposed solution is tested on real electricity consumption data over a long period. Results show that the proposed approach successfully handles time series data to detect future CO2 emissions excess and outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Methane emission reduction through hydrogen blending in a large bore 2-stroke lean-burn natural gas compressor engine</title>

                Impending and increasingly stringent emissions regulations regarding natural gas compressor engines drive the research behind blending hydrogen with natural gas to make these internal combustion engines and their combustion process more efficient. This investigation seeks to answer two fundamental questions: will blending hydrogen with natural gas reduce overall engine fuel consumption, and can greenhouse gas emissions be reduced by blending hydrogen with natural gas? A 4-cylinder Cooper&#8211;Bessemer GMV engine, housed at Colorado State University&#8217;s Powerhouse facility, was investigated for hydrogen&#8211;natural gas blending using multiple engine configurations. A lean-burn engine uses an active pre-combustion chamber as its ignition source, along with electronically activated high pressure fuel injection in the main combustion chamber. One configuration tested utilized high-pressure fuel injection and blending in hydrogen, up to 40% by volume, in both the main chamber and pre-combustion chamber fuel supplies. A second configuration, where the main combustion chamber fuel was solely natural gas and only the pre-combustion chamber received hydrogen-blended natural gas, was also tested. The final configuration to be tested used low pressure fuel injection with mechanically actuated valves in the main chamber with a traditional spark plug ignition source. All engine configurations saw reductions in methane emissions of up to 30% using blended natural gas and hydrogen. Carbon dioxide emissions were also shown to be reduced for the two configurations. A reduction in brake-specific fuel consumption of up to 2% was also seen for two configurations. These results support the hypothesis that blending hydrogen into natural gas can reduce engine total fuel consumption and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</description>

      <title>Improving Energy Efficiency of School Buildings: A Case Study of Thermal Insulation and Window Replacement Using Cost-Benefit Analysis and Energy Simulations</title>

                This study demonstrates the benefits of comprehensive school building (SB) energy efficiency (EE) improvements through building envelope renovations, lighting upgrades, and changes to cleaner heat sources. The parametric study in the building energy simulation software was used to check the application of various interventions on the energy consumption of existing SBs while reducing CO2 emissions with the most profitable return on investment (ROI). The energy savings from window replacements did not correspond with expectations. However, other measures such as the wall, roof insulation, and lighting modernization improved EE by up to 152 kWh/m2 and 41 kg/m2 CO2/m2 annually. The study also points to a significant trade-off between district heating (which reduces CO2 but has a slower ROI) and other heating solutions. The results suggest that climate-specific insulation thickness and glazing type needs are required, and optimal insulation strategies are shown to improve EE by 48&#8211;56% and CO2 reductions of 45&#8211;56%. Lighting replacement and biogas boiler use were both impactful. The findings support the importance of sustainable practices, which should stimulate educational awareness and environmental responsibility. This research presents actionable insights for EE and sustainable development from within educational facilities.</description>

      <title>ML-Enabled Solar PV Electricity Generation Projection for a Large Academic Campus to Reduce Onsite CO2 Emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17236188</link>

                Mitigating CO2 emissions is essential to reduce climate change and its adverse effects on ecosystems. Photovoltaic electricity is 30 times less carbon-intensive than coal-based electricity, making solar PV an attractive option in reducing electricity demand from fossil-fuel-based sources. This study looks into utilizing solar PV electricity production on a large university campus in an effort to reduce CO2 emissions. The study involved investigating 153 buildings on the campus, spanning nine years of data, from 2015 to 2023. The study comprised four key phases. In the first phase, PVWatts gathered data to predict PV-generated energy. This was the foundation for Phase II, where a novel tree-based ensemble learning model was developed to predict monthly PV-generated electricity. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) technique was incorporated into the proposed framework to enhance model explainability. Phase III involved calculating historical CO2 emissions based on past energy consumption data, providing a baseline for comparison. A meta-learning algorithm was implemented in Phase IV to project future CO2 emissions post-solar PV installation. This comparison estimated a potential emissions reduction and assessed the university&#8217;s progress toward its net-zero emissions goals. The study&#8217;s findings suggest that solar PV implementation could reduce the campus&#8217;s CO2 footprint by approximately 18% for the studied cluster of buildings, supporting sustainability and cleaner energy use on the campus.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Solar-Assisted CCHP Systems: Enhancing Efficiency and Reducing Emissions Through Harris Hawks-Based Mathematical Modeling</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su162310694</link>
      <description>Uchechi Ukaegbu, Lagouge K. Tartibu, C.W. Lim, Sustainability. 16(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405119278

                The increasing demand for energy, driven by technological advances, population growth, and economic expansion, has intensified the focus on efficient energy management. Tri-generation systems, such as Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power (CCHP) systems, are of particular interest due to their efficiency and sustainability. Integrating renewable energy sources like solar power with traditional fossil fuels further optimizes CCHP systems. This study presents a novel method for enhancing the CCHP system efficiency by identifying the optimal design parameters and assisting decision makers in selecting the best geometric configurations. A mathematical programming model using the Harris Hawks optimizer was developed to maximize the net power and exergy efficiency while minimizing CO2 emissions in a solar-assisted CCHP system. The optimization resulted in 100 Pareto optimal solutions, offering various choices for performance improvement. This method achieved a higher net power output, satisfactory exergy efficiency, and lower CO2 emissions compared to similar studies. The study shows that the maximum net power and exergy efficiency, with reduced CO2 emissions, can be achieved with a system having a low compression ratio and low combustion chamber inlet temperature. The proposed approach surpassed the response surface method, achieving at least a 4.2% reduction in CO2 emissions and improved exergy values.</description>

                Complexes, where a doubly reduced CO22&#8211; (carbonite) ligand is spanned between a nickel(II) centre and a transition metal(II) ion (TM = Fe, Co, Zn) have been accessed. In non&#8208;coordinating solvents the carbonite ligand exhibits a flexible coordination behaviour as observed by NMR spectroscopy and supported by DFT calculations. In particular the [Ni&#8208;CO2&#8208;Fe] representative replicates the respective entity in an intermediate formed during CO2&#8208;conversion by the enzyme [Ni,Fe]&#8208;CODH in many ways (structure, spectroscopic properties, reactivity). Our investigations reveal that transition metal ions reduce the reduction potential of the carbonite unit but increase its tendency to undergo C&#8208;O bond cleavage. This may explain the choice of an iron(II) ion as part of the active site.</description>

                We identify corporate commitments for reductions of greenhouse gas emissions&#8212;green pledges&#8212;from news articles using a large language model. About 8% of publicly traded U.S. companies have made green pledges, and these companies tend to be larger and browner than those without pledges. Announcements of green pledges significantly and persistently raise stock prices, consistent with reductions in the carbon premium. Firms that make green pledges subsequently reduce their CO2 emissions. Our evidence suggests that green pledges are credible, have material new information for investors, and can reduce perceived transition risk.</description>

      <title>From Policy to Practice: The Influence of Institutional Quality on the Management of Migration in Africa</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.47772/ijriss.2024.8110120</link>

                This study assesses the extent to which institutional quality affects international migration in Africa, using a panel data of 44 countries within the time period of 2000 to 2020. The new economics of labour migration theory and the new institutional economics theory were mobilized. Through the adoption of the principal component analysis, the institutional quality index variable was obtained by the joint combination of the six institutional quality measures including; voice and accountability, political stability, rule of law, control of corruption, government effectiveness and regulatory quality. The study employed the use of the generalized methods of moments estimation technique to investigate the relationship between institutional quality and international migration in Africa. Findings show that government effectiveness, political stability, regulatory quality and the institutional quality index have positive significant correlation with international migration in Africa; the control variables including carbon-dioxide emissions, infrastructure, unemployment, inflation, population growth, total natural resource rents, trade openness and gross fixed capital formation all record positive and negative significant correlations international migration and these results were robust to those analysed by use of the simultaneous quantile regression and the Driscoll and Kraay standard errors estimation techniques. The study therefore, recommends that the governing organs of the nations in the African Continent should endeavour to stimulate cooperation, develop concrete political policies regarding immigration and co-development through effectively ensuring the adoption of strong natured institutions that embark on sustainably adhering to equitable reduction in corruption practices, political instabilities and full government effectiveness in every sector of the nations.</description>

                We report JWST NIRSpec/G395H observations of TOI-1685 b, a hot rocky super-Earth orbiting an M2.5V star, during a full orbit. We obtain transmission and emission spectra of the planet and characterize the properties of the phase curve, including its amplitude and offset. The transmission spectrum rules out clear H$_2$-dominated atmospheres, while secondary atmospheres (made of water, methane, or carbon dioxide) cannot be statistically distinguished from a flat line. The emission spectrum is featureless and consistent with a blackbody-like brightness temperature, helping rule out thick atmospheres with high mean molecular weight. Collecting all evidence, the properties of TOI-1685 b are consistent with a blackbody with no heat redistribution and a low albedo, with a dayside brightness temperature 0.98$\pm$0.07 times that of a perfect blackbody in the NIRSpec NRS2 wavelength range (3.823-5.172 um). Our results add to the growing number of seemingly airless M-star rocky planets, thus constraining the location of the "Cosmic Shoreline". Three independent data reductions have been carried out, all showing a high-amplitude correlated noise component in the white and spectroscopic light curves. The correlated noise properties are different between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors - importantly the timescales of the strongest components (4.5 hours and 2.5 hours, respectively) - suggesting the noise is from instrumental rather than astrophysical origins. We encourage the community to look into the systematics of NIRSpec for long time-series observations.</description>

      <title>Energy Policy Scenarios for Carbon Emissions in Road Passenger Transport in Austria up to 2050</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21926/aeer.2404026</link>

                The transport sector currently contributes to about 25% of total CO2-emissions in the EU as well as in Austria. The largest share is caused by individual passenger car transport, primarily powered by fossil fuels. It is imperative to replace conventional cars with sustainable alternative technologies and explore alternative modes of transportation, all while reducing the overall vehicle kilometres driven. To meet climate targets, the implementation of effective policies is crucial, and phasing out fossil fuel vehicles is an inevitable step. The core objective of this study is to analyze which policy strategies in road passenger transport in Austria up to 2050 lead to a significant reduction in CO2-emissions. To do so, four scenarios for energy consumption and CO2-emissions, are derived and modelled: a Business-as-Usual Scenario, a Phase-Out-Scenario of fossil fuels, a Tax-Scenario and a Green-Policy-Scenario. Of specific relevance is that our approach is considering flow and embedded CO2-emissions. The major driving factors considered encompass income, vehicle kilometres driven, vehicle power, fuel intensity, and specific CO2-emission factors. The BAU-Scenario continues current policy trends without major changes. The Phase-Out- Scenario looks at gradually stopping the use of fossil fuel vehicles. The Tax-Scenario uses higher financial measures to reduce the use of high-emission vehicles. The Green-Policy-Scenario combines various strategies to encourage public transport and active mobility and improve vehicle efficiency. The major conclusions are: (i) The total vehicle kilometres travelled and overall vehicle stock must be reduced. (ii) Focusing on BEVs is not sufficient; a modal shift towards public transport and active mobility is important. (iii) Public transport and active mobility need to be made more attractive options. These steps will help reduce emissions and create more sustainable urban environments.</description>

      <title>Comparative Assessments of At-Sea and Inland Low- and Medium-Pressure CO2 Transport</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17236171</link>

                Developing cost-efficient systems for transporting CO2 is key to accelerating the deployment of carbon capture and storage. The present work explores the impact of reducing the pressure of tank-based inland and at-sea transport on their techno-economic performance. The study uses established techno-economic models for CO2 transport, adjusted with the most up-to-date knowledge on the costs of low-pressure containment and transport. In particular, the impact of cargo tank material and design on the transport costs show that low-pressure cargo tank systems can be 50% less expensive than medium-pressure systems if materials with similar price and strength can be used. This results in reductions in transport costs as high as 30% for long distances. This is partly driven by the currently suggested size limitation on medium-pressure shipping that limits its economies of scale. If this limitation is alleviated, the cost advantage of low-pressure shipping compared to medium-pressure is more limited (10&#8211;20%) although it remains advantageous. The same scaling effects on capacity were not found for truck and barge inland transport, thus yielding 1&#8211;10% cost reductions of low-pressure transport relative to medium-pressure transport. These results imply that future systems may combine medium-pressure inland and low-pressure at-sea transport and that efficient solutions connecting the two must be investigated.</description>

      <title>Assessing corporate transition plans using a production asset-based planning approach</title>

                Abstract Corporate transition plans (TPs) are increasingly seen as crucial components of assessing the compatibility and credibility of corporate commitments to meet climate targets. However, robust and transparent methods to assess the credibility of disclosed TPs are lacking. Here we propose a novel open-source methodology for assessing the credibility of corporate TPs based on asset-level data to estimate CO2 emission trajectories: the production asset-based planning approach (APA). We test this approach on a sample of ten electric utilities and ten steel companies and find that only three of the companies&#8217; stated TPs are compatible with Paris-aligned benchmarks. We also find that 12% and 42% of existing carbon-intensive assets operated by electric utility and steel companies, respectively, will require reinvestment before 2030, posing significant carbon lock-in risk. Applying this method will ensure that TPs can be assessed in a robust manner and help drive CO2 emission reductions towards achieving the Paris climate target.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Performance and Emissions from a Hybrid Vehicle Integrated with a Low Temperature Combustion Engine Undergoing a Drive Cycle</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.4271/2024-28-0140</link>

                &lt;div class="section abstract"&gt;&lt;div class="htmlview paragraph"&gt;In the last decade, the increased global temperature, stringent regulations, and customer demand for high fuel economy have led to the accelerated development of alternative propulsion solutions, with particular focus on electrified vehicles. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), the combination of electric machinery with conventional powertrains, allows diversifications of powertrain architectures. In addition, it has been demonstrated that engines employing advanced low temperature combustion concepts, such as dual fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI), and able to operate on both renewable and conventional fuels, produce ultra-low nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions while maintaining thermal efficiency similar to conventional diesel operation at part load operating conditions. This study aims to investigate the potential of integrating a gasoline-diesel RCCI engine in an HEV in achieving reduced fuel consumption and lower NOx and PM emissions compared to a conventional diesel powertrain. In this work a combination of engine experimental data and a vehicle powertrain simulation tool (AVL CRUISE) is employed to determine the vehicle level emissions and performance of a commercial vehicle on the worldwide harmonised light-duty vehicles test cycle (WLTC). In order to assess the emissions, the powertrains are simulated utilising both conventional diesel combustion (CDC) and RCCI-CDC dual combustion mode engines as the primary power sources. For a series hybrid vehicle, NOx emissions decreased by 67% and soot emissions decreased by 70% compared to a CDC vehicle. However, the combustion efficiency decreased in the RCCI mode, resulting in a significant increase in total hydrocarbon (THC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. Moreover, the implementation of the HEV technology results in decreased fuel consumption, leading to a 40% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions compared to the CDC vehicle. These results indicate the potential of HEVs, particularly when equipped with RCCI-CDC dual combustion mode engines, to achieve reduced fuel consumption and emissions, thereby offering a promising solution for sustainable transportation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Experimental study on the energy assessment of CombiSave device for hot water control</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.70401/jbde.2024.0005</link>
      <description>Mawada Abdellatif, Benjamin Muzhona, David Furlong, Yassin Osman, Jeff Cullen, Laurence Brady, Deleted Journal. 3(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404977160

                Every household uses an average of around 360 litres of water each day. About 21% of a typical gas consumption is attributed to heating the water for showers, baths, and hot water from the tap. An environmentally friendly, low-cost device called the CombiSave valve can be used to manage gas and water consumption and should be fitted to most combination boilers to automatically control the flow of water every time a hot tap is turned on. This allows the boiler to heat the water faster and only return the flow to normal once a usable temperature is reached. An experimental test was conducted in the exemplar modern house of Liverpool John Moores University in order to assess the amount of water, energy, and CO2 reduction for varying temperatures and flow rates. The test was carried out for a duration of 9 hours during the daytime between June and October. Although the test was conducted over relatively warm months when ambient water temperatures were higher compared to winter months, results showed that good savings could be achieved through this product. The best savings for gas consumption and hence CO2 reduction were achieved at high water pressure and low temperature setting (40&#8451;) of 36% compared with the case without combiSave. While water consumption was reduced by 56% at full flow rate and 45&#8451;. Further research is needed encompassing multiple occupied dwellings with different family sizes and testing these in extreme weather conditions to see if similar results would be reflected.</description>

      <title>Life Cycle Assessment of Microalgae-Based Products for Carbon Dioxide Utilization in Thailand: Biofertilizer, Fish Feed, and Biodiesel</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.159019.1</link>

                Background Microalgae-based products offer a sustainable solution for food, fuel, and agricultural inputs, presenting environmental benefits and economic opportunities. A comprehensive assessment is needed to understand their potential in supporting sustainability goals, considering the complex interplay between production methods, energy sources, and environmental impacts. Methods This study evaluated the environmental impacts of three microalgae-derived products &#8211; biodiesel, fish feed, and biofertilizer &#8211; through a comprehensive life cycle assessment. Nine scenarios were explored comparing three electricity profiles (current Thai mix, 50% renewable/50% current mix hybrid, 100% renewable) across the three products. The assessment evaluated environmental impacts and potential economic benefits of transitioning to these microalgae-based alternatives. Results and discussion All products demonstrated potential for significant environmental benefits under increased renewable energy scenarios. Fish feed consistently exhibited the lowest environmental impacts across all categories examined, showing substantial improvements with increased renewable energy use. With an annual demand of 0.4 million tonnes, fish feed could generate USD 560 million in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 1.1 million tonnes. Fulfilling the projected biodiesel demand of 4,015 million liters per year through microalgae production could yield approximately USD 3.5 billion in revenue and reduce CO2 emissions by 30 million tonnes compared to conventional fossil-based diesel. Additionally, algal biofertilizer production could meet a 5 million tonnes annual demand, offering USD 2 billion in revenue while reducing CO2 emissions by 6 million tonnes yearly. Collectively, these products could offset 37 million tonnes of CO2, representing about 14% of Thailand&#8217;s total CO2 emissions, contributing significantly to the country&#8217;s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target of 20-30% greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Conclusion Transitioning to microalgae-based products could transform the aquaculture, energy, and agricultural sectors, potentially supporting the national climate change mitigation goals, if implemented.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nexus between medical gases and ion channel function: implications for therapeutic innovation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.4103/mgr.medgasres-d-24-00076</link>
      <description>Chitaranjan Mahapatra, Medical Gas Research. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405166232

                Medical gases such as oxygen (O2), nitric oxide (NO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and xenon (Xe) are indispensable in contemporary medical practice. These gases are widely used in various therapeutic scenarios, including critical care, anesthesia, and respiratory therapy. While their primary applications are well established, emerging research suggests that these gases can modulate the function of ion channels&#8212;integral membrane proteins that facilitate the passage of ions across cell membranes. Ion channels such as potassium (K+), sodium (Na+) and calcium (Ca2+) ion channels play a pivotal role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, regulating the membrane potential, and mediating signal transduction. The interaction between medical gases and ion channel function is an evolving area of research with significant implications for therapeutic innovation. This perspective examines the mechanisms by which medical gases influence ion channel activity and explores the potential clinical implications of these interactions. O2 is essential for cellular respiration and energy production, but its influence extends beyond these fundamental processes. O2 levels can modulate the activity of various ion channels, leading to diverse physiological and pathological outcomes. O2-sensitive K+ channels, particularly the voltagegated K+ (Kv) family, play crucial roles in regulating vascular tone and respiratory responses to hypoxia (low O2 levels).1 Under hypoxic conditions, these channels are inhibited, leading to membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx, which results in vasoconstriction. This mechanism is especially important in pulmonary circulation, where hypoxia-induced vasoconstriction redirects blood flow to better-oxygenated regions of the lungs. Additionally, the inhibition of Kv channels by hypoxia is central to the response of the carotid body, a key mechanism in regulating respiratory drive under low O2 conditions. O2 also affects Na+ channels (Nav), particularly in the central nervous system. Hypoxia can inhibit Nav channels, reducing neuronal excitability and potentially contributing to neuroprotection during ischemic events.2 Conversely, hyperoxia (high O2 levels) has been shown to increase Nav channel activity, which can exacerbate excitotoxicity (neuronal damage caused by the excessive release of glutamate or other excitatory plasma membrane receptors) and neuronal damage under certain pathological conditions. NO is a versatile signaling molecule involved in various physiological processes, including vasodilation, neurotransmission, and immune responses. Its interactions with ion channels are central to its broad biological effects. NO modulates Ca2+ channels (Cav) through multiple mechanisms.3 Directly, NO can nitrosylate cysteine residues on Cav channels, altering their gating properties. Indirectly, NO stimulates guanylate cyclase, increasing cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels and activating protein kinase G, which phosphorylates the channels. The modulation of Cav channels by NO is crucial in regulating vascular smooth muscle tone, where NO-induced inhibition of these channels leads to vasodilation and a reduction in blood pressure. NO is known to modulate ion channels through S-nitrosylation, a process where NO attaches to specific cysteine residues on the channel protein. This modification can change the channel's structural configuration, affectingion conductance and gating properties. In large- conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels, structural changes induced by gas interactions can influence the selectivity filter, altering the ability of the channel to discriminate between different ions.4 The activation of BKca channels by NO is a key mechanism in NO-mediated vasodilation. NO can activate these channels directly through S-nitrosylation (covalent attachment of a nitric oxide group to a cysteine thiol within a protein to form an S-nitrosothiol) or indirectly via the cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;protein kinase G pathway. The activation of BKca channels leads to hyperpolarization of the cell membrane, which reduces Ca2+ entry and promotes the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle cells. CO2 plays a crucial role in maintaining acid&#8211;base balance and is a potent regulator of ion channel function. Changes in CO2 levels, which lead to alterations in the intracellular and extracellular pH, can significantly impact ion channel activity. Proton-sensitive ion channels, such as acid-sensingion channels and certain two-pore domain K+ (K2p) channels, are directly influenced by pH changes due to fluctuations in CO2 levels.5 Acid-sensing ion channels are activated by extracellular acidosis (low pH), contributing to the sensation of pain, particularly under ischemic conditions where CO2 levels are elevated. In contrast, K2P channels are inhibited by acidosis, leading to membrane depolarization and increased excitability in neurons and other excitable cells. CO2-induced acidosis also affects gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors, which are chloride ion channels critical for inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system.6 Acidosis enhances the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors, increasing inhibitory tone in the brain. This mechanism may contribute to the sedative effects of CO2 and its role in modulating respiratory drive. Xe, a noble gas with unique anesthetic properties, is distinguished by its minimal side effects and lack of significant cardiovascular depression. Xe's anesthetic and neuroprotective effects are primarily mediated through its interactions with ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors. One of the most extensively studied interactions of Xe is with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, a subtype of glutamate receptor involved in excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity.7 Xe inhibits NMDA receptors by competing with glycine at its coagonist binding site. This inhibition is believed to underlie Xe's anesthetic and neuroprotective effects, as NMDA receptor overactivation is associated with excitotoxicity and neuronal damage in conditions such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. Xe also modulates K+ channels, particularly the TWIK- related K+ channel (TREK-1), which is a member of the two-pore-domain potassium family. TREK- 1 channels are mechanosensitive and play a role in setting the resting membrane potential and providing neuroprotection.8 Xe activates TREK-1 channels, leading to membrane hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability, which may contribute to its anesthetic and neuroprotective effects. Figure 1 provides an overview of how different gases modulate ion channels across the cell membrane, influencing the membrane potential.Figure 1: A schematic diagram illustrating how various gases regulate different ion channels, influencing membrane excitability by altering the membrane potential.The N-methyl-D-aspartate, gamma-aminobutyric acid type A, and acid-sensing ion channels are represented by NMDA, GABA, and ASIC, respectively. &#916;V denotes the change in the membrane potential. X+ is the nonspecific ion flow via nonspecific ion channels by neurotransmitter activation. ASIC: Acid-sensing ion channels; cGMP: cyclic guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate; GABA: gamma-aminobutyric acid; NMDA: N-methyl-D-aspartate; PKG: protein kinase G.The interactions between medical gases and ion channels have significant clinical implications. Understanding these interactions can elucidate the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of medical gases, highlight potential adverse effects, and pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies. Ion channels play a critical role in various physiological processes, making them attractive targets for therapeutic interventions.9 Medical gases could be used to modulate these channels, offering new treatment options for various conditions. For example, NO donors are already used clinically to treat conditions such as pulmonary hypertension by promoting vasodilation through the activation of K+ channels.10 Similarly, the neuroprotective effects of Xe in conditions such as stroke and traumatic brain injury could be harnessed through its modulation of NMDA receptors and potassium channels. While medical gases offer therapeutic benefits, their interactions with ion channels can also lead to adverse effects.11 For example, prolonged hyperoxia can exacerbate excitotoxicity by increasing sodium channel activity, potentially leading to neuronal damage. Similarly, excessive NO can lead to overactivation of K+ channels, causing hypotension and other cardiovascular issues. Therefore, understanding these interactions is crucial for optimizing the safe and effective use of medical gases in clinical settings. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms by which medical gases interact with ion channels. This includes exploring the effects of these gases on less well-studied ion channels and understanding how these interactions vary across different tissues and disease states. Advances in this area could lead to the development of new gas-based therapies or the optimization of existing therapies for a broader range of clinical applications. Moreover, the development of selective ion channel modulators that mimic the effects of medical gases could offer a targeted approach for treating various conditions without the need for gas administration. For example, small molecules that selectively modulate O2- sensitive potassium channels could be developed to treat hypoxia-related disorders without the complications associated with O2 therapy. The interaction between medical gases and ion channels represents a promising and clinically significant area of research. Gases such as O2, NO, CO2, and Xe have profound effects on ion channel function, influencing a wide range of physiological processes and therapeutic outcomes. Ion channel agonists and antagonists of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ can help manage cellular pathologies by modulating the effects of gases such as NO, CO2, and O2. For Na+ channels, agonists such as veratridine enhance channel activity, whereas antagonists such as lidocaine and tetrodotoxin inhibit depolarization to reduce cellular excitability. K+ channel agonists, including minoxidil and retigabine, promote channel opening to stabilize the membrane potential, whereas antagonists such as 4-aminopyridine block these channels to delay repolarization. Ca2+ channel agonists such as Bay K8644 increase channel activity, boosting intracellular Ca2+ levels, whereas antagonists, such as nifedipine and verapamil reduce Ca2+ influx, help to prevent calcium overload. Together, these agents offer therapeutic options for counteracting gas-induced alterations in ion channel behavior. Understanding these interactions provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of action of these gases and opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention. As research progresses, this field holds the potential to revolutionize the management of various medical conditions through innovative gas-based and ion channel- targeted therapies.</description>

                The transition to green energy and sustainable operations poses a key challenge for the mining industry, which has traditionally been known for its negative environmental impact. This manuscript researches the concept of the "green transition" in mining, focusing on the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in methodological support for environmental restoration. The aim is to identify and analyze technological and methodological innovations that can facilitate the shift of mining operations towards more environmentally sustainable practices. The current challenges in the mining industry are analyzed, including carbon dioxide emissions, water pollution, and land degradation. Successful green transition projects in mining are presented, highlighting how the use of renewable energy sources and material recycling can reduce the environmental footprint of mining activities. The role of artificial intelligence in supporting these efforts is important. AI technologies, including machine learning and data analytics, can significantly enhance environmental monitoring and management processes. Specific examples of AI applications in predicting environmental risks are presented, optimizing resource use, and developing strategies for ecosystem restoration. AI algorithms enable more precise and efficient pollution monitoring, identification of optimal restoration sites, and assessment of the long-term effects of mining activities on the environment. Integration of AI into the mining industry can not only improve environmental performance but also contribute to economic benefits through cost reduction and increased efficiency. This paper emphasizes the need for an interdisciplinary approach that includes collaboration between managers, engineers, ecologists, and AI experts to achieve sustainable development goals. Further research and investment in these areas are crucial for the successful green transition of the mining industry and the long-term preservation of the environment. This research contributes to the understanding of the potential of green transition in mining and the role of AI in achieving sustainable environmental solutions, providing a foundation for future studies and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Path to Low-Cost Direct Air Capture</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2411.15369</link>
      <description>P. Eisenberger, Matthew J. Realff, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404986360

                It is now accepted that gigatonnes of Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) from the atmosphere are needed to avoid the threat of catastrophic climate change. Direct Air Capture (DAC) is a promising scalable CDR with a relatively small environmental footprint. But questions about DAC cost and energy use remain that are delaying the needed DAC policy decisions to create a mobilization effort like was done in the Manhattan Project and to address the Covid crisis. Global Thermostat (GT) has publicly claimed costs of under 50 dollars per tonne for mature GT technology deployed at a climate relevant scale. Why this low DAC cost is achievable will be addressed by a simplified analysis of generic DAC costs and using that analysis combined with experimental data to evaluate GT's DAC technology. A detailed cost analysis of different approaches to DAC by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) found an approach to DAC that had a learning cost limit as low as 25 dollars per tonne GT's DAC technology will be shown in Appendix 1 to have the same performance characteristics of the lowest-cost DAC identified in the NAS study. Thus, like solar costs, DAC costs can be reduced by learning by doing, but in the case of DAC, only one order of magnitude in cost reduction is needed. Therefore DAC technology can reach its low learning by doing cost limit at a scale much smaller than necessary to address climate change. From a climate perspective, current DAC embodiments costs and scale have less relevance than their learning curve cost limit. While GT's technology has demonstrated the crucial performance parameters to achieve a low-cost DAC, no inference should be drawn that other approaches cannot achieve low or lower cost, if they can demonstrate the crucial performance parameters. Continued R&amp;D on those performance parameters is needed.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2893/1/012114</link>
      <description>Fabio Fatigati, Davide Di Battista, Roberto Carapellucci, Roberto Cipollone, Journal of Physics Conference Series. 2893(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404997506

                Abstract Refrigeration sector including heat pumps, cryogenics and air conditioning is responsible for a share close 10% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, a huge effort of the scientific and industrial community is needed on the development of technologies allowing to reduce the environmental impact of this sector. The use of CO2 as working fluid has great interest in food chain conservation and participates to the problem of the impact produced by the traditional synthetic fluids, recently oriented also to hydrocarbons. Main problem of plants using CO2 as working fluid is the low COP, which reduces even more in moderate or hot climate regions in which low temperature thermal energy is more required. To assess the benefits introduced by plant optimization and innovative technologies, many advanced thermodynamic models are developed in the last years. Anyway, few software platforms are developed for the comprehensive analysis of plant behaviour. To fill this gap, this paper presents the results of a theoretical and experimental research done on an industrial trans-critical CO2 refrigeration plant. The aim was to set up energy saving solutions finalized to mitigate the intrinsic low COP values. A detailed physically consistent model of the unit has been developed following an integrated zero and mono-dimensional thermo-fluid-dynamic approach. The propagative, capacitive, and inertial properties of the components have been considered, so going beyond of the theoretical approaches that are typical in the sector. A wide experimental characterization of the unit has been done with the aim to validate the model and to use it as tool to predict the effect on the COP of the operating variables. The reduction of the compressor absorption and the potentiality of the energy recovery from energy usually wasted have been analysed.</description>

      <title>Carbon Neutrality Pathways for Industrial Parks and Reduction Potential Based on Text Analysis and Empirical Research</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su162310771</link>
      <description>Yuheng Sun, Zhengyuan Feng, Fangtao Liu, Yuanhang Li, Jun Ning, Hang Fu, Shoujuan Tang, Guangxin Liu, Jing Wang, Lei Shi, Sustainability. 16(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405196088

                Climate change is seriously threatening ecological environments essential for human survival. Achieving the carbon neutrality goals of industrial parks (IPs), the gathering places of industrial activity, plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation and in promoting sustainable industrial development. In this study, we use an AI-facilitated literature review and empirical research to analyze and classify the 12 pathways for carbon neutrality for IPs based on the development nature and carbon flow framework. In addition, the carbon emission reduction potentials of various pathways are quantified using a case study. The results of the literature analysis show that, in terms of IP carbon emission reductions, most research has focused on the energy infrastructure related to energy management and utilization, as well as the service infrastructure related to the carbon footprint and industrial symbiosis. Among the 148 studies, &#8220;industrial symbiosis&#8221; and &#8220;carbon footprint&#8221; appeared with frequencies of 1278 and 474, respectively. Additionally, 102 of these studies mentioned decarbonization of energy infrastructure. In total, 11 of the carbon neutrality pathways existed in the empirical research, with the exception of carbon storage, and among them, 7 pathways are applied across all 104 IPs. Case studies indicate that the pathways with greater reduction potentials were the energy infrastructure, carbon capture, and the product and waste infrastructure, with potential reductions of 250,000 tons, 200,000 tons, and 145,080 tons of CO2 emissions, respectively. This study provides valuable references for IPs to achieve their carbon neutrality goals.</description>

                In this paper the cylinder deactivation technique in spark ignition engines was investigated. The potential of this concept was analysed using engine working cycle simulation model AVL Boost. The engine power output regimes corresponding to the vehicle moderate constant driving speeds were considered and the results show that at that low load engine operating regimes cylinder deactivation can enable fuel economy improvement of about 6-13% and corresponding CO2 emission reduction. The angular speed variations of engine crankshaft under cylinder deactivation conditions were also analysed and it was found that the speed variations increase several times compared to the standard operation of the engine with all active cylinders.</description>

      <title>Editorial: Sustainable forest management under climate change conditions &#8212; A focus on biodiversity conservation and forest restoration</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/ffgc.2024.1533425</link>
      <description>Arbi J. Sarkissian, Mykola Kutia, Frontiers in Forests and Global Change. 7(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405123132

                Exposing the complex challenges with incentivizes for sustainable forest management are amongst the several highlights presented in this Research Topic. Zwerts et al. examined the feasibility of protecting Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs) through Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification, drawing attention to the delicate balance between conservation and economic viability. They explored the spatial distributions of IFLs to determine the percentage of overlap forest management units (MUs) have within them, which they express as the 'conservation burden' . Their findings emphasize the need for nuanced approaches to protecting IFLs through alternative measures for generating value (e.g., payments for ecosystem services) that also consider local socio-economic contexts. This study contributes to the broader discourse on GIS and modeling techniques, particularly with respect to fragmented landscapes shown in other recent studies (Myroniuk et al., 2020). Their study also emphasizes the need for transferring knowledge of socioeconomic and ecological interactions to diverse stakeholders to facilitate broader sustainable forest management efforts globally.China, through its government-sponsored payments for ecosystem services (PES) schemes, has contributed to one of the largest expansions of planted forests in the world over the last few decades (Salzman et al., 2018;Zhai et al., 2023). This has especially played a crucial role in storing carbon, stabilizing soils, and providing watershed services (Cheng et al., 2024;Wen and Th&#233;au, 2020). In this issue, Zhang et al. provided a comprehensive analysis of the economic potential of reforestation in China as a means to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Their study constructs spatially disaggregated marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves to project the effects of carbon pricing on enhancing reforestation efforts across different regions in China. The key findings indicate that carbon prices of US $20 and $50 per ton of CO2 could significantly increase reforestation efforts, leading to substantial carbon dioxide removals over the next four decades. The results emphasize the importance of targeting reforestation policies to regions with the highest abatement potential to maximize cost-effectiveness. This research aligns with the themes of the special issue by addressing the integration of economic strategies with ecological restoration efforts, particularly in mitigating climate change.China's planted forests have been estimated to capture carbon by nearly threefold over the last three decades (Cheng et al., 2024). Yet the capacity of these forests to sustain carbon storage over the next several decades will largely depend on the implementation of sustainable forestry strategies (Yu et al., 2024), including harvesting of timber and replanting with diverse native species (Hua et al., 2022). on these recent developments, Fan et al. developed a framework for evaluating Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) suitability in the Saihanba Nature Reserve, Hebei province, located within the "Three-Norths Shelter Belt." The study employs a matter-element model to assess the suitability of different areas for restoration based on factors such as land cover type, landscape structure, soil quality, and topography. The findings reveal that approximately 55.55% of the study area is suitable for restoration, predominantly comprising natural secondary forests characterized by large patch areas, close patch distances, and complex patch shapes. The study's insights are crucial for informing sustainable forest management practices that integrate ecological considerations with landscape-level restoration efforts, contributing to broader goals of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem resilience in the face of climate change.Understanding the complex dynamics of biotic and abiotic factors influencing natural landscapes is essential for effective forest restoration and conservation efforts, which are often hampered by the impacts of climate change. Khan et al. focused on the vegetation dynamics of Pinus gerardiana Wallichex. D. Don forest in South Waziristan, Pakistan, showing how aspectual variations influence species richness and abundance. They revealed critical insights into the role of microclimatic conditions in forest management, for both restoration and conservation efforts. The study underscores the importance of sustainable management practices to conserve these ecologically valuable landscapes, contributing to our understanding of the assessment, restoration, and preservation of wood and non-wood resources.Climate change has also imposed biotic challenges to sustainable management of forest resources. Aslam et al. investigated the effectiveness of various pesticides at different concentrations and temperatures for controlling Odontotermes obesus, a termite species that poses a significant threat to certain vulnerable forest ecosystems. The study evaluates the mortality rates and behavioral responses of termites when exposed to pesticides and found that chlorantraniliprole, particularly at higher temperatures, was the most effective pesticide, showing the lowest lethal time (LT50). This research aligns with the themes of the special issue by contributing to sustainable forest management practices. It emphasizes the importance of understanding species-specific responses to pesticide treatments in the context of integrated pest management (IPM), which is crucial for maintaining forest health and resilience.Finally, Jin et al. investigated how climate change could affect the potential geographic distribution of three significant subtropical tree species in China: Cunninghamia lanceolata, Pinus taiwanensis, and Quercus glauca. Using the MaxEnt model and data on various environmental variables, their study predicts shifts in the suitable habitats of these species under current and future climate scenarios (2050s and 2090s). The findings reveal that climate factors, particularly temperature and precipitation, play a more significant role than soil and topography in determining these species' distributions. Notably, C. lanceolata is expected to experience a northward expansion of its habitat, while P. taiwanensis and Q. glauca may face substantial reductions in their suitable areas, with Q. glauca at significant risk. The study emphasizes the importance of early intervention and adaptive management to mitigate these impacts. This research is highly relevant to the themes of the special issue as it underscores the importance of understanding species-specific responses to climate change for effective forest management and conservation strategies. The insights provided can inform the development of adaptive management practices and contribute to global efforts in forest restoration and biodiversity conservation under changing climatic conditions.As major drivers of biodiversity loss and degradation of ecosystem services globally (Marques et al., 2019), reconciling how to improve agriculture and forestry activities sustainably continues to be one of the hallmark challenges of our time. In this decade of ecosystem restoration, Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) efforts must therefore consider the importance of food security (De Pinto et al., 2020), including its role in agroforestry activities broadening social, environmental, and ecological benefits (Bosshard et al., 2021). We are also reminded of the trade-offs involved in forest restoration efforts, particularly those between plantations and native forests (Hua et al., 2022), if forests are to remain resilient under a changing climate. This also points to the trade-offs between long-term benefits over short-term costs through investing in genetic diversity (e.g., species suitability, seed sourcing, and planting stocks) to achieve more resilient FLR efforts (Nef et al., 2021).With this collection, we aim to advance the understanding of sustainable forest management in the context of climate change. The articles in this Research Topic provide evidence that successful forest management requires a multifaceted approach, integrating ecological, economic, and social considerations, also echoed in recent contributions within this journal (Mantilla Contreras et al., 2023). As we continue to confront the challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss, the insights gained from these studies will be invaluable in shaping policies and practices that promote the long-term health and resilience of the world's forests.</description>

      <title>Optimized E-Mobility and Portable Storage Integration in an Isolated Rural Solar Microgrid in Uganda</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/solar4040033</link>

                This work analyses load profiles for East African microgrids, and then investigates the integration of electric two-wheelers and portable storage into a solar PV with battery microgrid in Uganda, East Africa. By introducing e-mobility and portable storage, demand side management strategic load growth can thus be achieved and electricity access can be expanded. Battery degradation is also considered. The results showed a 98.5% reduction in PV energy curtailment and a 57% reduction in the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from 0.808 USD/kWh to 0.350 USD/kWh when the electric two-wheeler and portable storage loads were introduced. Such reductions are important enablers of financial viability and sustainability of microgrids. It is possible to avoid emissions of up to 73.27 tons of CO2/year with the proposed e-bikes, and an average of 160 customers could be served annually as off-microgrid consumers without requiring an investment in additional distribution infrastructure. Annual revenue could be increased by 135% by incorporating the additional loads. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying component costs, the battery lifetime, the interest rate, and the priority weighting of the additional loads. The battery costs were found to be a major contributor to lifecycle costs (LCC) and also have a big impact on the LCOE. The interest rate significantly affects the LCC as well.</description>

                Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) has captivated widespread attentions, yet achieving the requisite efficiency, selectivity and stability for industrial applications poses a persistent challenge. Here, we report the synthesis of 2D mesoporous Ni single atom catalysts in N&#8208;doped carbon framework via a bottom&#8208;up interfacial assembly strategy. The 2D mesoporous Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst showcases an ultrathin thickness (~6.7 nm) with well&#8208;distributed 5 to 40 nm&#8208;width mesopores in plane and a high surface area. As a result, the Ni single atom sites with a high density (~6.0 wt.%) are almost completely exposed and can be accessible, and the mass transfer can be greatly promoted even at high current densities. Thus, an industry&#8208;level current density of 446 mA cm&#8208;2 with &gt; 95% CO selectivity in a flow cell can be obtained. Concurrently, the catalyst demonstrates an impressive stability, maintaining a 50&#8208;hours continuous electrolysis in the membrane electrode assembly test and achieving an energy efficiency of 42%. Finite element analysis reveals that the 2D mesoporous design enhances CO2 diffusion, ensuring efficient adsorption and swift CO desorption at high current densities. Our study paves a way for the fabrication of 2D mesoporous single atom catalysts with nearly 100% accessibility and expedited mass transport.</description>

      <title>Drivers of methane-cycling archaeal abundances, community structure, and catabolic pathways in continental margin sediments</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.29.625990</link>
      <description>Longhui Deng, Damian B&#246;lsterli, Clemens Glombitza, Bo Barker J&#248;rgensen, Hans R&#248;y, Mark A. Lever, bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405065484

                Marine sediments contain the largest reservoir of methane on Earth, with most of this methane being produced and consumed in situ by methane-cycling archaea. While numerous studies have investigated communities of methane-cycling archaea in hydrocarbon seeps and sulfate-methane transition zones, little is known about how these archaea change from the seafloor downward in the far more common diffusion-dominated marine sediments. Focusing on four continental margin sites of the North Sea-Baltic Sea transition, we here investigate the in situ drivers of methane-cycling archaeal community structure and metabolism based on geochemical and stable carbon-isotopic gradients, functional gene (mcrA) copy numbers and phylogenetic compositions, as well as thermodynamic calculations. We observe major vertical and lateral changes in community structure that largely follow changes in organic matter reactivity and content, sulfate concentration, and bioturbation activity. While methane-cycling archaeal communities in bioturbation and sulfate reduction zones are dominated by known methyl-dismutating taxa within the Methanosarcinaceae and putatively CO2-reducing Methanomicrobiaceae, the communities change toward dominance of known methane-oxidizing taxa (ANME-2a-b, ANME-2c, ANME-1a-b) in sulfate-methane transitions. Underlying methanogenesis zones were characterized by a change toward mainly physiologically uncharacterized groups, including ANME-1d and several new genus-level groups of putatively CO2-reducing Methanomicrobiaceae and methyl-reducing Methanomassiliicoccales. Notably, group-specific increases in mcrA copy numbers by 2 to 4 orders of magnitude from the sulfate reduction zone into the sulfate-methane transitions or methanogenesis zones indicate the thriving of several major methane-cycling archaeal taxa. Together our study provides insights into the community and pathway shifts vertically along the geochemical gradients and horizontally along the different sedimentary settings and their underlying drivers in continental margin sediments.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Influence of Heat-Insulated Wheelhouses on Truck Tyre Temperature and Rolling Resistance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17236030</link>

                Due to legislations introduced to prevent global warming, vehicle manufacturers must find new ways to reduce CO2 emissions. This paper explores a way to reduce rolling resistance by heat-insulating and covering a truck&#8217;s wheelhouse. Truck tyre rolling resistance was measured at +5 &#176;C ambient temperature for consecutive speed steps in a climate wind chamber with and without heat insulation. The study showed that by encapsulating and insulating the wheelhouse, already generated strain-induced heat could be kept in the tyre, consequently leading to reduced rolling resistance. The tyre shoulder temperature was monitored during the experiments along with the tyre pressure. When the wheelhouses were encapsulated, a significant reduction in rolling resistance and an increase in tyre pressure and temperature were measured at all evaluated speed levels.</description>

                Silicon-based photoelectrochemical devices show promise for the performance of light-driven CO2 reduction but suffer from instability under photoelectrochemical conditions relevant to CO2 reduction. Coating silicon electrodes with thin layers of metal oxides has shown promise to passivate unstable silicon surfaces, and many different metal oxides can be deposited on silicon using various techniques. In this study, we investigate the fundamental photoelectrochemical performance of WO3-coated silicon photoelectrodes, which were generated by oxidation of W-metal films deposited via atomic layer deposition on both degenerately doped (nSi+) and low-doped (pSi) silicon. Two different oxidation temperatures were investigated (400 and 600 &#176;C), and it was found that the monoclinic phase of WO3 predominates at both temperatures but that more grain boundaries are present in the 600 &#176;C film. From X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the stoichiometry of both films was found to be 1:3 W:O, and low electron energy loss experiments indicate band gaps of 3.0 and 3.1 eV for 400 and 600 &#176;C films, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry experiments showed that the electron transfer kinetics increased after continued redox cycling, particularly for the material produced at 400 &#176;C. X-ray photoelectron spectra suggest that the observed increase in electrode conductivity is due to the formation of oxygen vacancies in the film. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy indicated that charge transport through the films was impacted by the grain boundaries that formed during oxidation of the film. Photoelectrochemical studies on pSi/WO3 electrodes were highly variable, only producing a photocurrent and photovoltage with some samples. Our best sample, formed at 400 &#176;C, produced a photovoltage of 180 mV, which is lower than what has previously been reported for WO3-coated silicon (500 mV). We hypothesize that the variability in photoelectrochemical experiments arose from a roughened WSiOx interface that is generated during film preparation. WO3 shows promise as a metal oxide coating for silicon, but our results suggest that formation of a high-quality interface between Si and WO3 is vital for best performance.</description>

                The building sector is a major contributor to resource consumption, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable architecture offers a solution, leveraging Building Energy Modeling (BEM) for early-stage design optimization. This study explores the use of genetic algorithms for optimizing sustainable design strategies holistically. A comprehensive analysis and optimization model was developed using genetic algorithms to individually optimize various sustainable strategies. The optimized strategies were then applied to a pre-existing building in Kabul City, a region facing significant environmental challenges. To enhance accuracy, this study integrated energy simulations with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This research combines genetic algorithms with energy simulation and CFD analysis to optimize building design for a specific climate. Furthermore, it validates the optimized strategies through a real-world case study building. Optimizing the Window-to-Wall Ratio (WWR) and shading devices based on solar exposure significantly improved the building&#8217;s energy performance. South (S)-facing single windows and specific combinations of opposing and adjacent windows emerged as optimal configurations. The strategic optimization of building component materials led to substantial energy savings: a 58.6% reduction in window energy loss, 78.3% in wall loss, and 69.5% in roof loss. Additionally, the optimized pre-existing building achieved a 48.1% reduction in cooling demand, a 97.5% reduction in heating demand, and an overall energy reduction of 84.4%. Improved natural ventilation and controlled solar gain led to a 72.2% reduction in peak-month CO2 emissions. While this study focused on applicable passive design strategies, the integration of advanced technologies like Phase Change Materials (PCMs), kinetic shading devices, and renewable energy systems can further improve building performance and contribute to achieving net-zero buildings.</description>

      <title>Tandem Electroreduction of CO2 to C2+ Products based on M&#8208;SACs/Cu Catalyst</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202403297</link>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR) is considered a highly promising method to produce high&#8208;value chemicals and fuels, contributing significantly the artificial carbon balance. Cu species exhibit a distinct role in the formation of C2+ products characterized by enhanced energy density. The limited selectivity of C2+ products, along with the inferior stability, and high overpotential demonstrated by single&#8208;component Cu catalysts, hinders their applicability in industrial&#8208;scale production. The implementation of a tandem strategy, which involves coupling the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO pathway using metal single&#8208;atom catalysts (M&#8208;SACs), etc., with the CO&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion on Cu species, represents a novel approach for the efficient generation of C2+ products. Given the high cost and restricted availability of noble metals, M&#8208;SACs have attracted substantial interest in tandem systems. The systematic analysis of the design principles and structure&#8208;activity relationship is essential for the advancement of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysts. Here we first introduce various prevalent design strategies of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysts for ECO2RR and then systematically summarize the latest advancements of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem system, encompassing metal&#8208;organic frameworks/Cu (MOFs/Cu), covalent organic frameworks/Cu (COFs/Cu), and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support transition metal single atomic materials/Cu (M&#8208;N&#8208;C/Cu). Lastly, we discuss the challenges and opportunities with the design and construction of M&#8208;SACs/Cu&#8208;based tandem catalysis for ECO2RR.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced electron transfer across phospholipid bilayers in anaerobic and aerobic atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-x7wgx</link>
      <description>Novitasari Sinambela, Richard Jacobi, Dieter Sorsche, Leticia Gonz&#225;lez, Andrea Pannwitz, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404982864

                In natural photosynthesis, light-driven electron transfer across the thylakoid membrane enables efficient charge separation and the confinement of reaction spaces for generating NADPH and CO2 and oxidation of water. These reactions are complementary redox reactions and require different reaction conditions for optimal performance. However, current artificial photosynthesis studies only take place in the bulk and are sensitive towards oxygen and air, which limits their applicability under aerated and water-splitting conditions. Herein, we report light-driven electron transfer across a lipid bilayer membrane of liposome vesicles via a rigid oligoaromatic molecular wire that allows to electronically connect an oxidation and reduction reaction which are spatially separated by the membrane. The molecular wire has a simple, symmetric, easy-to-synthesize design based on benzothiadiazole and fluorene units and absorbs in the visible spectrum which makes it suitable for solar energy conversion. The model reactions in this study are light-driven NADH oxidation on one side of the membrane and light-driven reduction of an organic water-soluble dye in the bulk phase of liposomes. Additionally, the system is active in both aerobic and anaerobic atmospheres, rendering it ideal for aerobic conditions or reactions that produce oxygen such as solar-driven water splitting and artificial photosynthesis applications.</description>

                Air pollution from the shipping industry is an ongoing problem that requires exploring innovative technologies for effective resolution. The integration of wind-assisted ship propulsion (WASP) technology offers a promising route towards decarbonisation of the shipping industry. The paper investigates possible fuel savings and CO2 reduction by implementing wind assisted propulsion on a case-study vessel operating on a known route in the Adriatic Sea. The long-term contribution of added wind propulsion is analysed by implementing a Velocity Prediction Program (VPP) and available meteorological data for the area of interest. VPP is modified to predict the contribution of wind propulsion to the overall propulsion necessary to achieve the vessel design speed. The case study quantifies long-term fuel savings for ship operating a liner route and harnessing favourable (predictable) north-west winds, complementing the conventional propulsion systems.</description>

                The increasing demand for high-grade manganese ores in various industries has led to a growing necessity to enhance the quality of lower-grade manganese ores with time. A representative manganese ore was collected from Um Bogma, Sinai, Egypt, and subjected to various characterization methods including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and ore microscopy. XRF analysis revealed a low Mn/Fe ratio of 2.81 (as elements), indicating a low ore grade. For suitability in Mn alloy production at the Sinai Manganese Company (SMC) plant in Abu Zenimah, southeast of Sinai, Egypt, this ratio should ideally exceed 5. Additionally, XRD and ore microscopy identified the mineralogical composition of the ore as pyrolusite, hematite, and manganite, with manganese patches embedded in a ferruginous groundmass at the textural scale. Three different reduction roasting techniques were evaluated, involving conventional heating in a furnace utilizing either CO &#8211; CO2 or charcoal as reducing agents, alongside reduction roasting with charcoal utilizing microwave technology. Following each technique, magnetic separation was employed, resulting in the production of high-grade manganese concentrates exhibiting high Mn/Fe ratios ranging from 19.8 to 27.45 and substantial Mn recovery rates ranging from 93.86% to 96.76%.</description>

      <title>The influence of yoga exercises with voluntary pulmonary ventilation changes on intracranial arterial blood flow</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.33667/2078-5631-2024-30-49-54</link>
      <description>A. V. Frolov, S. &#1040;. Ermolaeva, &#1052;. D. Didur, Medical alphabet. None(30)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405012427

                Introduction. Yoga breathing exercises that involve voluntary changes in pulmonary ventilation parameters can potentially influence cerebral circulation due to changes in CO2 content in arterial blood. Objective. To assess the effect of yoga breathing exercises with changes in pulmonary ventilation levels on blood flow parameters in the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Methods. The study included 21 participants, with an average age of 39.5&#177;8.7 years, who were capable of performing yoga exercises at respiratory rates (RR) of 3&#8211;3.5/min and 1&#8211;1.5/min. For 5 minutes, participants underwent three stages: free breathing (stage 1), breathing with RR=3&#8211;3.5/min (stage 2), and breathing with RR=1&#8211;1.5/min (stage 3). During stages 2 and 3, the &#171;full breathing&#187; technique, which involves maximum deep inhalation and exhalation, was employed. Respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (TI), minute ventilation (MV), end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (PetCO2), and oxygen fraction in exhaled air (FeO2) were recorded using spiro-gas analysis. Transcranial duplex scanning was used to measure peak systolic blood flow velocity (Vps), end-diastolic blood flow velocity (Vd), time-averaged maximum blood flow velocity (TAMAX), and resistance index (RI) in the right MCA. The velocity variation index (VVI) was calculated for each stage. Results. Compared to stage 1 (free breathing), stage 2 (RR = 3&#8211;3.5/min) showed an increase in MV and FeO2, a decrease in PetCO2, and reductions in Vps, Vd, and TAMAX, with an increase in RI. VVI decreased statistically insignificantly. In stage 3 (RR = 1&#8211;1.5/min), compared to stage 1, there was an increase in PetCO2, a decrease in MV and FeO2, and increases in Vps, Vd, and TAMAX, with a decrease in RI. VVI increased significantly. Conclusions. Yoga breathing exercises at respiratory rates of 3&#8211;3.5/min and 1&#8211;1.5/min result in multidirectional shifts in ventilation and gas exchange parameters, leading to changes in arterial cerebral blood flow (a decrease and increase in blood flow velocity with an increase and decrease in MV, respectively). VVI, reflecting fluctuations in blood flow velocity, increases significantly with reduced MV, likely due to the vasodilatory effect of CO2.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Direct Operating Costs for the Wright Spirit Electric Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/aerospace11121007</link>
      <description>Katie Goodge, Paul Withey, Aerospace. 11(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405111893

                Global warming and CO2 emissions have become increasingly pressing concerns, with the aviation industry contributing significantly to these issues. In response, efforts have been made to develop environmentally sustainable aviation solutions. This paper examines the Direct Operating Costs (DOCs) of the Wright Spirit, one of the options for electric flight, compared to the conventional BAe 146 on which the Wright Spirit is based. Utilising methodologies adapted from previous studies (largely the AEA method), the analysis investigates various factors influencing DOC including battery prices, flight duration, and charging time. The results indicate a 73% increase in overall DOCs from the BAe 146 to the Wright Spirit, largely influenced by battery costs and lifespan. However, an 83% reduction in fuel/energy costs suggests the potential viability of the Wright Spirit, particularly with anticipated reductions in battery prices. For instance, a quartering of battery prices could result in a GBP 5 increase in costs for 1 h flights; compared to the BAe 146. Moreover, the analysis finds the battery lifespan and charging time to be the most important factors to control in order to increase commercial feasibility. Ticket price comparisons suggest that the Wright Spirit&#8217;s costs align closely with current market prices, with a flight from Paris to Heathrow predicted to cost the airline GBP 136.10 per passenger. Future research could explore alternative electric aircraft designs to further assess their impact on DOCs and ticket prices</description>

                The building sector is responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thereby exacerbating climate change. To meet the growing need to minimize carbon footprints and improve construction energy efficiency, the development of eco-friendly building materials is crucial. This research concentrates on the development and assessment of lightweight insulating low-carbon mortar. This material is regarded as a prospective solution for regenerative architecture in Algeria due to its advantageous properties. This research aims to explore the characteristics of this material within the context of regenerative architecture, assessing its potential to enhance thermal insulation and energy efficiency of buildings and reduce CO2 emissions. This approach aligns with the principles of the "Materials" petal of the Living Building Challenge (LBC) certification, promoting architecture that goes beyond sustainability to become regenerative. To this end, we proceeded to make samples, conduct testing and laboratory studies on several specimens of this material, and perform digital simulations using RETA software. This mortar, is composed of low-CO&#8322; cement and lightweight aggregates, providing notable advantages in thermal insulation, energy efficiency, and GHG emissions reduction. In this way, it is observed that the thermal performance of buildings is improved, with a potential reduction in thermal energy consumption of up to 20% and a decrease in GHG emissions of up to 40% compared to conventional mortars. These, allows us to conclude that this ecological mortar contributes in initiatives that promote energy efficiency and sustainable development, promoting a transition towards more environmentally respectful regenerative architecture in Algeria and globally.</description>

                Abstract Introduction: Telemedicine has emerged as a key tool to overcome socioeconomic disparities, expand healthcare access, and reduce environmental impacts. Its adoption surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, minimizing travel-related barriers and ensuring continuity of care. In Brazil, where regional inequities in healthcare access and pollution heavily affect public health, telemedicine holds significant promise. However, further research is needed to quantify its economic and environmental benefits. Moreover, examining how socioeconomic factors influence patients' preferences for telemedicine is essential. These correlations help identify patterns that may influence telemedicine adoption and provide deeper insights into how socioeconomic factors can affect access to and benefits from remote healthcare services. Objective: To evaluate the economic and environmental impacts of telemedicine use and the correlation of socioeconomic variables with telemedicine preference in patients with hip pathologies at a tertiary referral center in S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil. Methods: A cross-sectional study (January-June 2024) analyzed telemedicine patients, collecting data on preferences, demographics, travel, and costs (transport and food). Avoided distance, time, and pollutant emissions were calculated using Google Maps and emission factors. Correlations were conducted between patients' preference for telemedicine and their socioeconomic data. Statistical analyses used Wilcoxon, chi-square, and logistic regression tests. Results: 148 patients participated, with 77.7% preferring telemedicine. The mean avoided travel distance was 168.84 km, with a mean time saving of 223.97 minutes. Patients using public transport and private cars saved, respectively, USD 12.62 and USD 28.95. Telemedicine also reduced pollutant emissions, avoiding approximately 7 tons of carbon dioxide. Telemedicine preference was positively associated with higher income (p = 0.0283). Other variables showed no statistically significant associations. Conclusion: Telemedicine led to significant time and cost savings, as well as a reduction in pollutant emissions. These findings demonstrate telemedicine&#8217;s potential to improve access and reduce environmental impacts. Preference for telemedicine was positively associated with higher income, highlighting potential barriers for lower-income populations. Further research is needed to address the lower adherence to virtual consultations among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.</description>

                The article presents a sensitivity analysis of the carbon footprint for different modes of transporting neodymium magnets over a selected route, in the context of their environmental impact and sustainable development. Neodymium magnets, widely used in modern technologies such as wind turbines, are essential for renewable energy sources, making the selection of environmentally optimal transportation crucial. The calculations included road, rail, inland waterway, and air transport, using available emission calculators, which allowed for an analysis using averaged emission indicators for each mode of transport. Additionally, a comparative analysis was conducted with the SimaPro program to verify the consistency and accuracy of the results. The findings indicated that rail transport, with access to low-emission infrastructure and a reduced carbon footprint per unit of mass, is the most efficient option for CO2 emissions reduction, whereas air transport, despite its speed, generates the highest emissions per ton of cargo, making it the least environmentally friendly alternative. A t-test analysis was also conducted to statistically validate the results for each transportation option.</description>

      <description>Ragnhild Bieltvedt Skeie, Rachael Byrom, &#216;ivind Hodnebrog, Caroline Jouan, Gunnar Myhre, Atmospheric chemistry and physics. 24(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405008356

                Abstract. New regulations of sulfur emissions from shipping were introduced in 2020, reducing emissions of SO2 from international shipping by &#8764; 80 %. As SO2 is an aerosol precursor, this drop in emissions over the ocean will weaken the total aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) that has historically masked an uncertain fraction of the warming due to the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Here, we use four global climate models and a chemical transport model to calculate the ERF resulting from an 80 % reduction in SO2 emissions from international shipping relative to 2019 emission estimates. The individual model means range from 0.06 to 0.09 W m&#8722;2, corresponding to the ERF resulting from the increase in CO2 concentration over the last 2 to 3 years. The full uncertainty in the ERF due to the new regulation is not quantified but will very likely be high considering the contribution of uncertainties in shipping SO2 emissions, the sulfur cycle, the modelling of cloud adjustments and the impact of interannual variability on the method for calculating radiative forcing.</description>

                This research introduces an innovative integration of a Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC) with a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) system utilizing autothermal reforming (ATR) of natural gas. This novel approach focuses on large-scale industrial applications, addressing scalability and performance optimization, areas previously underexplored. The study conducts a comprehensive parametric analysis of system efficiency, achieving a remarkable 91.3% total efficiency, with 38.1% electrical efficiency and 46.1% thermal efficiency. Economic analysis revealed strong regional differences, with Europe offering the highest Net Present Value (NPV) and a payback period of 4.0 years, while Iran showed a longer payback period of 8.3 years. The system demonstrated adaptability to fluctuating electricity prices, particularly in the U.S. Environmentally, the system achieved a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions and reduced natural gas consumption compared to conventional gas turbines. This innovative study addresses scalability challenges and offers new insights into optimizing PEMFC-CHP systems for sustainable industrial energy generation, contributing to the advancement of clean energy technologies.</description>

      <title>Examining Ethanol-Biodiesel-Diesel Blends: Impact on Diesel Passenger Car Performance and Emissions under Legislative Test Cycles</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.4271/2024-28-0125</link>
      <description>Vipin Dhyani, Y. P. Patil, Nikita Singhal, Chinmayananda Khandai, Raghava Kannala, M. Muralidharan, SAE technical papers on CD-ROM/SAE technical paper series. 1(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405010123

                &lt;div class="section abstract"&gt;&lt;div class="htmlview paragraph"&gt;Incorporating ethanol and biodiesel into diesel fuel offers substantial benefits from bioenergy perspective. To assess the effect of these alternative fuels, a study was undertaken to evaluate the impact of Ethanol-Biodiesel-Diesel blends (BD7, E2B7, E5B7) on the performance and emissions of a diesel car under Modified Indian Driving Cycle (MIDC), Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC), wide-open throttle (WOT), and acceleration tests. A four-cylinder 1.5L Common Rail Turbo based diesel passenger car was selected for the study. The test findings revealed that under MIDC conditions, biodiesel blend (BD7) resulted in higher CO emissions compared to neat diesel, but these emissions decreased with the addition of ethanol (E2B7 and E5B7) due to ethanol's embedded oxygen content. While biodiesel lowered THC emissions, these emissions increased when ethanol was added. NOx emissions increased with biodiesel due to its higher cetane number and shorter ignition delay, and this trend persisted with the E5B7 blend. Under WLTC conditions, BD7 showed higher CO emissions. However, THC emissions decreased across all blends compared to neat diesel, while NOx emissions increased. CO2 emissions, on the other hand, decreased with all blends due to their lower carbon content and improved combustion efficiency. Despite a reduction in calorific value, a marginal improvement in fuel economy was observed. In terms of vehicle performance, the vehicle power remained consistent with improved acceleration time with respect to fuel blends. These results highlight the potential of ethanol-biodiesel-diesel blends to reduce CO2 emissions and improve fuel economy, with the challenge of increased NOx. Long duration trials focusing on vehicle durability including fuel system&#8217;s performance, are needed to ensure the viability of these blends in diesel vehicles.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                Batch-cell provides a quick way to test the performance of an electrochemical catalyst. A fundamental understanding of physics behind the batch-cell operation could shed light on parameters that either could be fine-tuned to get the desired performance, or by careful optimization, overall performance of the batch-cell could be improved. Therefore, a 1-D numerical model is developed to study the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) in a batch-cell with three different working electrode configurations: solid electrode (SE), gas diffusion layer electrode (GDLE), and glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Experimental results of two Cu-based catalysts are used to obtain the electrochemical kinetic parameters, and to validate the numerical model. Simulation results demonstrate that, both gas diffusion layer electrode, and glassy carbon electrode with porous catalyst layer (CL) have a superior performance over solid electrode in terms of total current density (TCD). Furthermore, we studied the impact of key parameters of batch-cell with glassy carbon electrode such as boundary layer thickness, catalyst layer thickness, catalyst layer porosity, electrolyte nature, and strength of an electrolyte on total current density at a fixed applied cathodic potential of -1.0 V vs RHE.</description>

      <title>Environmental Implications of Using Waste Glass as Aggregate in Concrete</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/jcs8120507</link>
      <description>Robert Lopez, Charbel El-Fata, Journal of Composites Science. 8(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405075472

                Approximately 10 billion tons of fine and coarse aggregate are manufactured worldwide annually, solely to be used as concrete for constructed structures. With approximately 80% of conventional concrete comprising sand and stone, activities in their extraction and relocation harm the natural environment. Manufacturing concrete causes substantial amounts of ecological damage and energy consumption. The replacement of natural aggregate with waste glass, therefore, theoretically removes this environmental damage and energy consumption. The research presented in this paper tested the theory that waste glass concrete aggregate represents a potential solution to curtail the adverse impact of concrete on the natural environment. Testing this theory entailed the review of the existing literature and analyses of the findings from a survey of 107 organizations situated in five countries within the concrete manufacturing supply chain. The findings of this research demonstrate that environmental implications exist with the use of both natural aggregate and glass waste. Significant CO2 reductions can be achieved by using glass as aggregate in concrete. This is found to be up to 60% and 65% for fine and coarse aggregates, respectively. In addition, using glass in its aggregate can potentially improve the strength of concrete. With a concrete grade of 20, an improved compressive strength test of up to 10 could be possible. Similarly, with concrete grades of 25 and 30, an improved tensile strength test of up to 9 could be possible. This depends on differences in the percentage of natural aggregate that has been substituted with glass.</description>

      <title>Green Algae to Green Fuel: Optimizing the Composition of Bio-Oil Additive Mixture from the Pyrolysis Process and RON 90 for Enhanced Engine Performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.31284/j.jmesi.2024.v4i2.6487</link>
      <description>Apip Amrullah, Herry Irawansyah, Abdul Ghofur, Rachmat Subagyo, Rizal Mahmud, Obie Farobie, Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science and Innovation. 4(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404990482

                This study explores the optimization of bio-oil additives derived from the pyrolysis of Ulva lactuca algae, blended with RON 90 gasoline to enhance engine performance and reduce emissions. Addressing the urgent need for sustainable energy, the research focuses on a relatively unexplored area&#8212;using algae-derived bio-oils in gasoline engines. The study aimed to identify the optimal blend ratio of bio-oil and gasoline to improve engine metrics such as brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC), thermal efficiency, and volumetric efficiency, while minimizing emissions like CO, CO2, and NOx. Experiments were conducted with bio-oil blended at 5%, 10%, and 15% by volume with RON 90 gasoline in a single-cylinder gasoline engine. Results showed that increasing bio-oil concentration led to improved fuel efficiency and thermal efficiency, along with significant reductions in CO and HC emissions. However, NOx emissions presented a complex trend, increasing at lower bio-oil ratios but decreasing significantly at the highest concentration. These findings suggest that algae-derived bio-oil can effectively enhance gasoline engine performance and reduce environmental impact, offering a novel, sustainable alternative fuel option. The study underscores the importance of optimizing blend ratios to maximize benefits and manage emissions, contributing valuable insights to sustainable energy research.</description>

                Objectives: The quantity of CO2 emissions that combustion energy sources in power plants, cars, industry, business sectors, households, and other sectors emit into the atmosphere would influence global warming. Therefore, reducing global warming may be achieved by energy efficiency technology and low-carbon energy sources. By examining how MRV, a ground-breaking REDD+ technology from Indonesia, Brazil, and Congo Governance, transformed forested landscapes into carbon domain that could be observed and controlled via the use of data-intensive mapping and techniques model. Theoretical Framework: To reduce deforestation, REDD+ was initially designed to be a scheme in which rich countries would compensate poor countries with trees (maybe through carbon markets). However, there have been questions over whether REDD+ will lead to significant reductions in emissions. Carbon reductions in the forest sector are becoming increasingly important for reducing emissions and meeting the NDC. Method: This study looks at literature reviews as a research method in addition to giving an overview of the many types of reviews and some standards for conducting and assessing literature review articles regarding carbon emission declarations and subsidiaries in Congo, Brazil, and Indonesia might be used. Result and Discussion: This study should be identified and analysed as follows: (i) Districts and regionals should be given incentives to produce or harvest more timber instead of disincentives from Nation Governance; (ii) State Forest mining fees should be increased to fully defray the costs of reclamation and rehabilitation of areas mined; (iii) Tightening technical requirements for underground mining in protection forests would limit the number of mining permits that local governments could be granted. Research Implications: This study achieved sustainable and equitable growth for everybody, there will need to be greater global collaboration on trade and climate change about carbon emission disclosures and subsidiaries. Originality/Value: This study identified and analysed carbon emission disclosures and subsidiaries in Indonesia, Brazil, and Congo also how to imply the regulations among those country.</description>

      <title>Microbial Upgrading of Lignin Depolymerization: Enhancing Efficiency with Lignin&#8208;First Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202400954</link>

                Chemical depolymerization of lignin is a non&#8208;selective process that often generates a wide distribution of product compounds, denoted herein as lignin breakdown products (LBPs). To address this limitation, we developed a hybrid lignin conversion approach that employs a lignin&#8208;first catalytic approach on biomass and subsequent microbial upgrading. A Pd/C catalyst was used for reductive catalytic fractionation (RCF) of poplar biomass, and Rhodococcus opacus PD630 (R. opacus PD630) was then cultivated on the resulting LBPs. This RCF approach increases the total biomass utilization by R. opacus PD630 over base&#8208;catalyzed depolymerization (BCD) reactions that were performed in the absence of Pd/C and molecular hydrogen (H2). LBPs generated using RCF resulted in higher cell growth per gram of biomass. Cellulose in the residual biomass after RCF treatment also showed enhanced enzymatic digestibility due to saccharification yields over 40%. Techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle analysis (LCA) of this hybrid lignin conversion scheme, integrated into a cellulosic bioethanol plant, decreased the minimum ethanol selling price from $4.07/gallon (base case) to $3.94/gallon. Global warming potentials ranged from 29 and 30.5 CO2,eq/MJ. These results highlight the potential for an industrial hybrid conversion&#8208;based biorefinery scheme that utilizes lignin&#8208;first catalytic deconstruction and R. opacus PD630 upgrading.</description>

                The tooling industry develops solutions year by year seeking operational efficiency improvement. Resources consumption in construction sites has attention paid when costs reduction is the way to achieve competitiveness for residential and commercial units which face a market even more demanding. Customers and shareholders are asking beyond best prices and gains, they definitely want to have tangibility for what was qualitative benefit. Safety at work is no more merely number of accidents, it is severe days off expenses and loss of reputation. Guaranteed delivery is no longer unique efficiency variable, where doing more with less is a must. Recipes can be deferred and profits maximized if what the plan was carried out within less time and resources. Taking a typical metal support element for infrastructure utilities (water, electricity, compressed air, gas, among others) as an example, this article aims to demonstrate the significant potential for reducing energy consumption when modular system replaces welded one, mainly if considered battery powered tools. Elements fixed with screws, washers, sliders and nuts reduce the complexity of assembly with 72% less time and up to 83% less material, using less and 42% cheaper labor. With an investment in tooling about 1/5 to 1/3 lower than conventional welded solution, the work becomes safer and more ergonomic. Thanks to the structure&amp;rsquo;s lower mass, the modular system saves CO2 emissions in transportation by 50% compared to the traditional solution.</description>

      <title>Torrefaction Temperature Effects on Grindability of Wheat Straw Using TG-FTIR Analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4067363</link>
      <description>Xinming Wang, Zhiwei Wang, Gaofeng Chen, Zaifeng Li, Shuhua Yang, Xinze Du, Ashwani K. Gupta, Journal of energy resources technology.. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405106833

                Abstract Torrefaction used for pretreatment of biomass can enhance grindability along with significant reduction of energy consumption required for pulverization to aid in large-scale utilization of biomass energy. In this study, torrefaction experiments of wheat straw were conducted at different temperatures using an experimental furnace facility. The influence of torrefaction temperature on the grindability of resulting wheat straw was explored using a Hardgrove grindability index tester and thermogravimetric-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR). Increase in torrefaction temperature significantly enhanced the carbon content of wheat straw and decreased oxygen content to result in decreased O/C ratio from 0.66 to 0.39. The calorific value increased by 24% from 15.42 MJ/kg to 19.17 MJ/kg. Increase in torrefaction temperature from 220 &#176;C to 269 &#176;C increased the grindability index from 29 to 115. The grindability of wheat straw can be controlled to values similar to that of coal by tuning the torrefaction temperature. The main gas components released during torrefaction were H2O, CH4, CO2, and CO. Thermogravimetric data showed 29% solid residue from the raw wheat straw. Increase in torrefaction temperature increased the solid residue to 41%. Pyrolysis of wheat straw at different torrefaction temperatures can be grouped into three stages of dehydration, rapid pyrolysis, and carbonization. This study reveals effective large-scale utilization of torrefied wheat straw biomass having high heating value of the solid fuel after torrefaction pretreatment.</description>

      <title>Genomic and proteomic characterization of sulfate-reducing symbionts of gutless marine annelids</title>

                Sulfate-reducing bacteria inhabit marine and terrestrial environments, forming syntrophic associations with other bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. A notable example is the symbiosis between sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and gutless oligochaete worms found in marine sediments worldwide. These endosymbionts participate in a syntrophic sulfur exchange with the primary endosymbiont of gutless oligochaetes, a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium, thus providing otherwise inaccessible metabolic capabilities to the animal host. Here, we used a combination of metagenomic and metaproteomic analysis to describe the metabolic functions of SRBs from gutless annelids. Identified as members of the Desulfobacteria class, closely related to the Desulfococcus and Desulfosarcina genera, these SRB symbionts exhibit a range of common and unique metabolic capabilities. Our analyses revealed their core metabolism of complete oxidation of acetate to CO2 via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, glyoxylate bypass of the TCA cycle, degradation of glycine as a nitrogen source, and presence of transporters for essential nutrients. A large-scale genome comparison revealed that the sulfate-reducing endosymbionts, named here "Candidatus Desulfoconcordia", have metabolic distinctions with respect to their free-living counterparts that could indicate adaptation to the energy and nutrient requirements of their symbiotic niche. The enrichment of functions like peptidases and amino acid transporters together with their abundant expression in the proteomes and the reduction of sugar and sulfur scavenging functions in the symbiotic genomes indicate a symbiosis-driven ecological role distinct from free-living SRBs. Our study revealed the metabolic capabilities that have enabled "Candidatus Desulfoconcordia" to adapt to their multi-domain associations.</description>

      <title>Development of New Generation Battery Cooling Hoses with TPV Material</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.4271/2024-28-0161</link>

                &lt;div class="section abstract"&gt;&lt;div class="htmlview paragraph"&gt;The market for battery-fitted electric cars continues to experience robust growth globally as well as in Indian market. During the charging process heat generation happen because of internal resistance of the battery cells and electrical connectors. Making an efficient battery cooling system is vital for all electric vehicles. One common cause of battery overheating is due to low cooling efficiency. So this research highlights the importance of scientifically designing coolant circuits and selecting appropriate coolant hose materials. Currently, EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer) material is widely used for battery cooling hoses due to its design Flexibility, Compatibility with a 50:50 glycol-water mixture and Resistance to thermal and ozone cracking [&lt;span class="xref"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;]. This study benchmarks EPDM hose technical properties with leading EV battery cooling plastic hose materials, such as mono layer polyamide, mono layer TPVs (thermoplastic vulcanizates) and PA PP two layer hose. Comparative experiments, including fluid compatibility, burst pressure, vacuum collapse, permeability, Aging, ozone resistance and mechanical property tests, were conducted on specimens made from these different materials. The results indicated that while EPDM performs adequately, it tends to degrade under the combined influence of air and coolant liquid stresses, particularly under thermal and mechanical conditions. Conversely, plastic materials TPV (Thermoplastic Vulcanizate) significantly improve all required functional properties like low internal surface friction, low outer surface condensation, enhancing recyclability, thus supporting end-of-vehicle-life sustainability, however excluding flexibility. The advanced manufacturing process of plastic hose also demonstrate a lower Co2 footprint compared to EPDM, because of low density, weight reduction by wall thickness reduction and with higher productivity rate. This research highlights the potential benefits of transitioning from EPDM to plastic materials for battery cooling hoses in electric vehicles, resulting in improved performance, environmental benefits, and increased manufacturing efficiency.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

                Abstract The glass industry plays a pivotal role in modern manufacturing, providing essential materials for a multitude of applications ranging from construction to consumer goods. However, the substantial energy demands, primarily driven by the intense heat required to melt raw materials within furnaces, pose significant challenges. Traditionally, thermal energy is sourced from combustion processes in dedicated chambers. Yet, in the pursuit of efficiency and environmental sustainability, there is a growing preference for integrated systems. Notably, the utilization of electrode installations within glass baths emerges as a promising choice for direct melting augmentation through electricity in a more efficient way. This study introduces a sophisticated computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, developed by the authors, tailored to simulate the real operation of a glass furnace. The model fully couples the reactive flow in the combustion space (the furnace) with convective motions within the glass tank including the effect of the electrodes. By changing the thermal energy from combustion with varying levels of electrode operation (keeping the same overall heat flux to the glass), the furnace behaviour is investigated. The research specifically examines the effects of electrode operation on crucial furnace parameters, including flame heat release and convective motions inside the glass bath, across different scenarios. Insights are gained into the complex interplay between electrode operation, thermal dynamics, and glass quality within the furnace environment. The findings of this study not only deepen the understanding of fundamental processes within glass manufacturing but also offer actionable insights for industry stakeholders. By elucidating the intricate relationship between electrode operation and glass melting process, this research provides practical guidance for optimizing furnace design and operation, enhancing efficiency and CO2 reduction, with the same product quality, in the glass industry.</description>

                The perishability and susceptibility to chilling of Carica papaya Linn have impeded its long-distance exportation, posing challenges to international trade investments. This study explores the efficacy of 1-MCP and geranium oil (GO) treatments in enhancing papaya's cold tolerance. Designated concentrations for 1-MCP were 300 and 600 mg/L, and for GO, 2% and 4% (v/v), with exposure times set at 30 and 60 mins. Subsequently, the fruits were stored at 4&#176;C for 16 days, and various parameters such as chilling injury (CI), weight loss (WL), respiratory rate (RR), firmness, colour, total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), pH, and ripening index (RI) were assessed at 4-day intervals. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in chilling damage in treated fruits. Specifically, the 60-minute exposure to 600 mg/L 1-MCP (MCP600+60) delayed the development of CI symptoms by at least 4 days compared to the control. At day 16, MCP600+60 exhibited the least WL (1.93%), O2 consumption (4.19&#177;0.25 mL/kg/hr), and CO2 production (4.05&#177;0.17 mL/kg/hr). Treated fruits, especially MCP600+60 and 30-minute exposure to 4% (v/v) GO (GO4+30), preserved firmness and colour. In GO treatments, GO4+30 showed the least increase in TSS (1.69-fold) and pH (1.09-fold). The highest TA and RI were reported in MCP600+60 and GO4+30. Overall, MCP600+60 emerged as the most effective treatment for enhancing papaya's cold tolerance and storage quality based on our study.</description>

                The paper examines the perspectives of hemp use in the textile, food, construction, energy and other industries, where not only the fibrous part is used but also seeds, leaves, bark, and roots. The cultivation of hemp worldwide is analysed, and the current Ukrainian trend, particularly the dynamics of the production of technical hemp in Ukraine, is researched in terms of technical hemp plant growing, which seems less promising despite the vast and marvellous increasing demand for hemp-based products worldwide. The advantages of using hemp fibre in construction as an ecological, heat-, sound-insulating, ecological building material are given. A comparison of the technical hemp fibre-based mixtures with such traditionally used in Ukraine construction materials as brick and autoclaved aerated concrete blocks was carried out according to such indicators: environmental friendliness, compression and bending strength, biodegradation, installation period, thermal conductivity and thermal resistance of walls, average density, cost and fire resistance. The comparison of hemp fibre-based insulation materials with other insulating materials is also provided. The advantages of hemp fibre for hempcrete production are lower specific weight, high environmental friendliness, and other parameters. The economic prerequisites for using technical hemp in construction are presented, such as an increase in the diversity of new job places creation, stimulation of innovations in construction, and support and creation of local entrepreneurship. These steps would significantly increase the deductions and taxes for infilling local budgets from an economic point of view and lead to a reduction of energy consumption and sequestration in CO2 emissions in terms of sustainability. A conceptual diagram of the organisational and economic principles of the use of technical hemp in construction, which includes an analysis of the problems preventing the use of hemp fibre in construction, has been proposed.</description>

                Using new sources of energy and inventing new methods for energy consumption has always been the focus of researchers. The building sector is known to contribute largely in total energy consumption and CO2. Expanding the availability of energy storage technology and materials is considered as crucial as discovering new energy sources. The International Energy Outlook by the EIA (Energy Information Administration of the outlook) examines and predicts future trends in building energy usage. It anticipates a 34% growth in energy consumption within the built environment over the next two decades, with an average annual increase of 1.5%. By 2030, it is projected that approximately 67% of this consumption will be attributed to dwellings, while the non-domestic sectors will account for about 33%. This study endeavors to combine one of these ventilation techniques from ancient Persian architecture, known as the windcatcher in the form of an innovative roof radiative cooling (Windcatcher) with a solar chimney. In order to save energy consumption and reduce environmental problems by presenting the idea of using solar energy to exhaust the air inside the building through the chimney and using the latent heat of water evaporation to create cooling that is carried out in the direction of the wind by the windcatcher. Hence, fuel consumption can be created in hot and dry areas, in a comfortable environment with suitable humidity conditions. The purpose of this research is to introduce computational areas (3D) and determine the governing values and methods calculated by Ansys Fluent software, which has enabled the use of suction and the creation of moisture balance and heat reduction without fuel consumption, which plays an important role in It implements energy efficiency in the building. This system is also able to save 60% cooling energy and 80% of the ventilation energy during peak hours in a warm and arid climate. Furthermore, the effects of a wall opening on ventilation and thermal efficiency were examined.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Agricultural Residues from Hot and Cold Climates as Sustainable SCMs for Low-Carbon Concrete</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su162310715</link>
      <description>Mohammed M. Ahmed, A. Sadoon, M. T. Bassuoni, A. Ghazy, Sustainability. 16(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405113782

                Supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), such as fly ash, slag, and silica fume, predominantly derived from industrial waste, are widely utilized in concrete due to their proven ability to enhance both its mechanical and durability properties. Moreover, these SCMs play a crucial role in mitigating the carbon footprint of concrete by reducing its cement content, which is responsible for approximately 8% of global CO2 emissions. However, the sustainability and long-term availability of conventional SCMs are increasingly under scrutiny, particularly in light of the impending shutdown of coal-fired power plants, which threatens the future supply of fly ash. As a result, the concrete industry faces an urgent need to identify alternative SCMs to maintain and advance eco-friendly practices. This article stands out from previous reviews by employing a bibliometric analysis to comprehensively explore the use of commonly utilized agricultural ashes (rice husk, palm oil, and sugarcane bagasse), prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions as SCMs. Additionally, it provides valuable insights into the potential of cold-weather crops (e.g., barley, canola, and oat) that demonstrate promising pozzolanic reactivity. The study critically evaluates and compares the physical and chemical characteristics of agricultural ashes from both hot and cold climates, assessing their influence on the fresh, mechanical, and durability properties of concrete. It also addresses the challenges and limitations associated with their use. Furthermore, in line with the United Nations and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sustainability goals, the review evaluates the environmental benefits of using agricultural ashes, emphasizing waste reduction, resource conservation, and energy savings. This comprehensive review paper should deepen the understanding of agricultural ashes as sustainable SCMs, providing a strategic direction for the construction industry to adopt low-carbon concrete solutions across various climates while promoting advancements in production methods, performance standards, and emerging technologies such as hybrid materials and 3D printing.</description>

                Today's world is facing a criticalglobal challenge of rising temperatures and disrupted ecosystems, primarily driven by increased carbon emissions. The study aims to determine the major factors leading to carbon emissions in five major carbon-emitting countries: China, the United States, India, Russia, and Japan. Specifically, it explores the interplay between economic growth, natural resource rent (Natural Resource Rent: The economic benefit a country gains from its natural resources, such as oil or minerals, after subtracting the cost of extracting and using them), technological change, renewable energy use, and carbon emissions. The study postulates that economic growth and natural resource extraction bear a substantial interaction that contributes to carbon emissions. At the same time, technological change and the usage of renewable energy could probably become imperative to alleviate such emissions. This research, therefore, provides a good insight into the determinants of CO2 emissions in these key economies and the probable pathways toward emission reduction through innovation and harnessing of renewable sources of energy. Utilizing the comprehensive dataset between 1990 and 2021 and employing the ARDL [Panel ARDL (Autoregressive Distributed Lag): A statistical method used to analyze how different factors affect each other over time in a dataset that includes multiple subjects (e.g., countries)] model on the panel data, this study examines both the short- and long-term effects of these variables on carbon emissions, considering cross-country heterogeneity. The results underscore the significance related to guidelines for sustainable development practices and the necessity for these leading economies to lead the shift towards sustainability. By identifying factors that can mitigate emissions and enhance resilience, this research provides useful inputs to the policymakers who intend to promote renewable sources of energy usage along with technological upgrades. This study's results contribute to the existing literature by making it a significant resource for future policy formulation and academic research in the field of mitigating climate change.</description>

      <title>Menvironmental impacts of crop production systems in subtropical plateau regions: case study of Yunnan, China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-80808-1</link>
      <description>Yousheng He, Minghao Li, Wei Zhang, Xinping Chen, Zhengxiong Zhao, Zhi Yao, Scientific Reports. 14(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405023909

                Excessive fertilisation, improper nutrient management, and specific climatic factors are the main reasons for the high environmental risks associated with agricultural production in subtropical plateau regions. However, quantitative data of environmental impacts and emission reduction potential remain unclear. The development potential of such systems is likely to be significant. In that context, we conducted a case study in Yunnan Province, China, to quantify the environmental impact of crop production from 2002 to 2021. A life cycle assessment method was employed to identify the factors driving environmental impacts, and potential mitigation strategies were proposed. The yield and total nutrient input of grain crops in Yunnan Province increased over the 20-year period, and the environmental footprint of crop production in Yunnan Province was higher than that in other regions. The average annual mean greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, soil acidification potential (AP), and water eutrophication potential (EP) of crop production from 2002 to 2021 were 837 kg CO2-eq&#183;Mg&#8722;1, 15.7 kg SO2-eq&#183;Mg&#8722;1, and 2.71 kg PO4-eq Mg&#8722;1, respectively. Environmental emissions from crops mainly originate from the application of agricultural inputs (including fertilisers (N, P, and K), pesticides, seed, diesel fuels, and plastic film) during the crop life cycle. There was a significant correlation between surplus nitrogen and environmental impacts. Scenario testing showed that optimised nutrient management practices could increase crop yield and reduce environmental costs. GHG emissions, AP, and EP from the production of rice, wheat, and maize are expected to decrease by 43.0&#8211;59.5%, 51.5&#8211;64.5%, and 57.4&#8211;71.5%, respectively (scenario 4, S4). Based on these findings, we propose that com-prehensive agricultural management measures can reduce the negative impacts of crop production on the environment in subtropical plateau areas and help achieve sustainable agricultural development.</description>

      <title>Decreasing foraminiferal flux in response to ongoing climate change in the Santa Barbara Basin, California</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-3374</link>

                Abstract. The rapid response of foraminiferal assemblages to changing climate makes their shells an invaluable geological record of the past. However, the time frame over which foraminifera respond to climatic signals and the specific drivers influencing assemblage composition and abundance remain obscure. We focus on the impact of ongoing, anthropogenic climate change on planktic foraminifera in the California Current ecosystem, which would appear as a nearly instantaneous event in the sediment record. The Santa Barbara Basin sediment trap, located off the coast of California, USA since 1993, provides a 28-year record of particulate and foraminiferal flux to the basin&#8217;s seafloor. The sediment trap captures the superposition of the annual cycle of seasonal upwelling, Pacific multiannual El Ni&#241;o-Southern Oscillation-driven temperature changes, and anthropogenically forced climate change. We present data on planktic foraminiferal flux collected between 2014&#8211;2021, at two-week intervals (164 samples, 60,006 individuals) and compare results to previously published data from 1993&#8211;1998. Consistent with previous studies, the most abundant species from 2014&#8211;2021 were Globigerina bulloides, Neogloboquadrina incompta, and Turborotalita quinqueloba, with peak fluxes occurring in the spring and summer. Lower fluxes and an increase in the abundance of N. incompta and subtropical species characterize the winter season. We find a 37.9 % decrease in total foraminiferal flux relative to the 1990s, primarily driven by a decrease in G. bulloides abundance. This decrease is accompanied by a 21.9 % overall reduction in calcium carbonate flux. We also find a decrease in the relative abundance of subtropical species (Globigerinoides ruber, Orbulina universa, Neogloboquadrina dutertrei) and their fluxes compared to the 1990s, contrary to expectations if assemblages and fluxes were to follow anthropogenic warming signals. We hypothesize that the observed decrease in subtropical species abundance and flux is likely related to an increase in acidification and in the timing and magnitude of upwelling along the California coast. The extremely rapid responses of foraminifera to ongoing changes in carbonate chemistry and temperature suggest that climate change is already having a meaningful impact on coastal carbon cycling. The observed decrease in particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) flux relative to particulate organic carbon (POC) flux may facilitate increased oceanic uptake of atmospheric CO2.</description>

      <title>Diaphragm ultrasonography: A picture is worth a thousand words</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1113/ep092452</link>
      <description>Ken D. O&#8217;Halloran, Experimental Physiology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405120786

                The diaphragm is the primary muscle of inspiration. Diaphragm dysfunction is surprisingly common, presenting in acute critical care, cardiorespiratory diseases, cancer cachexia, endocrine disorders, and neuromuscular and neurodegenerative diseases amongst other scenarios (Laghi et al., 2021). Assessment of diaphragm performance involves measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure, which assesses the force-generating capacity of the diaphragm in situ, typically by eliciting a twitch contraction of the diaphragm by electrical or magnetic activation of the phrenic nerves. A limitation of the approach, however, is that it does not reveal explicit detail of the shortening capacity of the muscle during contraction, which is an important aspect of diaphragm performance. The dome-shaped diaphragm muscle flattens during contraction increasing intra-thoracic volume, thereby decreasing intra-thoracic pressure, facilitating airflow into the lungs during inspiration. Work (force &#215; distance) and power (force &#215; velocity) are key measures of muscle performance, and therefore tools to complement the assessment of diaphragm force are warranted and could have additional experimental and clinical value. In this issue of Experimental Physiology, Illidi and Romer (2024) combine ultrasonography and respiratory manometry to quantify the change in contractile performance of the diaphragm during fatigue in healthy humans. Recreationally active, young male participants were recruited and enrolled in randomised fashion to two commonly employed experimental protocols designed to elicit diaphragm fatigue: (1) a low-force, high-velocity task of maximal isocapnic ventilation, and (2) a high-force, low-velocity task of maximal inspiratory resistive loading. Transdiaphragmatic pressure (gastric pressure minus oesophageal pressure) and ultrasound-derived data (diaphragm excursion) in response to phrenic nerve stimulation by magnetic stimulation and during a CO2-rebreathe test were performed before and after each fatiguing task. Two post-trial time points were assessed to measure fatigue at 10 and 30 min following each loading task. Measurement of diaphragm excursion parameters allowed for the calculation of mean excursion velocity. Diaphragm work and power were subsequently calculated incorporating pressure and ultrasound-derived measurements. Muscle fatigue is the reversible decline in force or power due to contractile activity. Based upon the measurement of transdiaphragmatic pressure, both loading tasks used in the study elicited diaphragm fatigue with similar reductions in transdiaphragmatic twitch pressure for maximal isocapnic ventilation and inspiratory resistive loading tasks. These reductions were notably less than those reported by others for the same tasks (Luo et al., 2001), and reductions were not seen in all participants, which the authors surmise may relate to participant demographics and in particular training status, as several participants in the study by Illidi and Romer (2024) were competitive athletes. Ultrasonography proved feasible for the assessment of fatigue-induced changes in diaphragm contraction in healthy participants. Inspiratory resistive loading resulted in significant decreases in ultrasound-derived measures of crural diaphragm absolute shortening and shortening velocity. The dominant change in diaphragm excursion measures, especially velocity of shortening, combined with the secondary changes in transdiaphragmatic pressure resulted in significant decreases in calculated diaphragm work and power lasting at least 30 min following completion of the loading task. Surprisingly, but intriguingly, maximal isocapnic ventilation had no effect on any of the ultrasound-derived measures. The authors offer a fair-spirited discussion addressing this unexpected outcome. In short, it is complicated! A variety of inter-related factors contribute to fatigue under different loading conditions. Whereas differences in the magnitude of fatigue elicited by force/pressure tasks compared to velocity/flow tasks have been described by other investigators, previous assessments of contractile function used maximal inspiratory manoeuvres that are highly dependent upon participant effort and motivation, which further complicates interpretation. A key advantage of the assessment of fatigue employed by Illidi and Romer (2024) is the use of objective, effort-independent, combined multi-metric determination of contractile performance. Illidi and Romer (2024) confirm the benefit of attendant use of ultrasound to assess diaphragm function demonstrating the power of imaging. But as always, the devil is in the detail! The study design and execution were meticulous. Yet, a relatively small sample size of young fit males was studied, including athletes, which limits generalisability of the findings to a wider population, especially an older population, which may be especially relevant to the consideration of diaphragm performance given the recognised decline in diaphragm and respiratory performance with advancing age. By design the study was restricted to male participants owing to the known sex differences in fatigue (Guenette et al., 2010), but diaphragm dysfunction in clinical settings is indiscriminate, so it will be important into the future to build a comparable portfolio in female participants. Combined diaphragm ultrasonography and respiratory manometry may have important application in the context of critical care, to monitor the expected diaphragm dysfunction following prolonged mechanical ventilation and to complement existing approaches to successful weaning, avoiding extubation failure (Dres et al., 2017). To date, diaphragm ultrasound alone to predict weaning outcome has yielded inconsistent results (see Laghi et al., 2021). A potential limitation of the study by Illidi and Romer (2024) is inference of diaphragm muscle performance based on crural diaphragm excursions. Whereas the action of the crural diaphragm is generally reflective of whole muscle, the costal diaphragm compartments contribute mostly to the action of the diaphragm as an inspiratory pump. Moreover, generally with ultrasound assessments, there are concerns with repeatability and reproducibility (i.e., variation in repeated measures within and between sonographers). Nevertheless, Illidi and Romer (2024) provide us with a potentially valuable tool to interrogate diaphragm function in health and disease. Sole author. The author declares no conflicts of interest.
