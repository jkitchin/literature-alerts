      <title>Metal&#8208;free N, P&#8208;Codoped Carbon for Syngas Production with Tunable Composition via CO2 Electrolysis: Addressing the Competition Between CO2 Reduction and H2 Evolution</title>

                Electroreduction of carbon dioxide into value&#8208;added fine chemicals is a promising technique to realize the carbon cycle. Recently, metal&#8208;free heteroatom doped carbons are proposed as promising cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, the lack of understanding of the active site prevents the realization of a high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for the CO2RR. Herein, we synthesized metal&#8208;free N, P co&#8208;doped carbons (NPCs) for producing syngas, which is composed of H2 and CO, by CO2 electrolysis using inexpensive bio&#8208;based raw materials via simple pyrolysis. The syngas ratio (H2/CO) can be controlled within the high demand range (0.3&#8208;4) at low potentials using NPCs by tuning the N and P contents. In comparison with only N doping or P doping, N and P co&#8208;doping has a positive impact on improving CO2RR activity. Experimental analysis and density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations revealed that negatively charged C atoms adjacent to N and P atoms are the most favorable active sites for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion compared to pyridinic N on N, P co&#8208;doped carbon. Introducing N atoms generates the preferable CO2 adsorption site, and P atoms contribute to decreasing the Gibbs free energy barrier for key *COOH intermediates adsorbed on the negatively charged C atoms.</description>

      <title>Nickel(II) Complexes Bearing Electron Donating OR/OH Groups on a Tetradentate Ligand Scaffold for Photocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>

                Nickel(II) complexes bearing tetradentate NCCN ligands composed of optionally protic pyridine and N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors have been synthesized and used as catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction. These complexes were synthesized bearing OMe, OBn, or OH substituents on the pyridine rings and were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, UV&#8211;vis, IR, HR-MS, and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The OH substituent was partially deprotonated, as shown by the crystal structure. Electrochemical studies show that these nickel complexes undergo two electron reduction events prior to CO2 reduction. Catalytic current enhancement under CO2 relative to N2 is not observed under dry conditions, but the addition of proton sources leads to modest current enhancement (icat/ip &lt; 2). Visible light driven photochemical CO2 reduction with a photosensitizer (Ir(ppy)3, where ppy = 2-phenylpyridine) and sacrificial electron and proton donors was studied, and formate is the major product with &#8764;10:1 formate to CO production. Electron donor groups (OMe, OBn, OH) do not enhance formate production (relative to the unsubstituted analogue), and CO production is only slightly enhanced. Overall with Ni(II), the tetradentate ligands are comparable to recently published pincer ligands for sensitized CO2 reduction, but pincer ligands offer a clear advantage in self-sensitized catalysis.</description>

                Abstract Developing advanced and economically viable technologies for the capture and utilization of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is crucial for sustainable energy production from fossil fuels. Converting CO 2 into valuable chemicals and fuels is a promising approach to mitigate atmospheric CO 2 levels. Among various methods, photocatalytic reduction stands out for its potential to reduce emissions and produce useful products. Here, novel perovskite ZnMoFeO 3 (ZMFO) nanosheets are presented as promising semiconductor photocatalysts for CO 2 reduction. Experimental results show that ZMFO has a narrow bandgap, exceptional visible light response, large specific surface area, high crystallinity, and various surface&#8208;active sites, leading to an impressive photocatalytic CO 2 reduction activity of 24.87 &#181;molg &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 and strong stability. Theoretical calculations reveal that CO 2 conversion into CO and CH 4 on the ZMFO surface follows formaldehyde and carbine pathways. This study provides significant insights into designing innovative perovskite oxide&#8208;based photocatalysts for economical and efficient CO 2 reduction systems.</description>

                Abstract The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO 2 RR) using nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (N&#8211;C) materials offers a promising and cost&#8208;effective approach to global carbon neutrality. Regulating the porosity of N&#8211;C materials can potentially increase the catalytic performance by suppressing the concurrence of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the augmentation of porosity usually alters the active sites or the chemical composition of catalysts, resulting in intertwined influences of various structural factors and catalytic performance. In this study, incorporating secondary carbon sources into the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) precursor through nanocasting aimed to selectively enhance the mesoporous structure, allowing for deciphering this effect from other changes in the catalyst composition. Consequently, the developed N&#8211;C catalyst exhibited a significant surface area with abundant mesopores, leading to a maximum Faradaic efficiency (FE) for carbon monoxide (CO) of 95% at &#8722;0.50 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE). Furthermore, the FE for CO is enhanced across a wide potential range, surpassing previously reported metal&#8208;free N&#8211;C eCO 2 RR catalysts. The investigation reveals that constructing mesoporous structures can induce excellent CO 2 catalysis by enhancing the accessibility of active sites while establishing an elevated local pH at these sites.</description>

      <title>High-Entropy Metal Sulfide Promises High-Performance Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>

                The efficient conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) requires the development of stable catalysts with high selectivity and reactivity within a wide potential range. Here, the high-entropy metal sulfide CuAgZnSnS4 is designed for CO2 reduction with excellent performance (FEcarbon products &#8805; 90%) in whole test potential windows (600 mV) based on the synergistic effect of the high-entropy metal sulfide. In particular, CuAgZnSnS4 exhibits better single-product selectivity with the highest FEHCOOH/FECO value (29.03) at &#8722;1.28 versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In combination with in situ measurements and theoretical calculations, it is further revealed that the synergistic effect of CuAgZnSnS4 realizes the controllable regulation of the surface electronic structure at Sn active sites, strengthening orbital interactions between *OCHO and Sn active sites. As a result, the effective adsorption and activation of *OCHO instead of *H are obtained, improving the single-product selectivity of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction and inhibiting the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction significantly. Our findings may complete the understanding of the synergistic effect for high-entropy materials in catalysis and offer new insight into the design of efficient electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity.</description>

      <title>Sorbent Mediated Electrocatalytic Reduction of Dilute CO2 to Methane</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-n3fc1</link>
      <description>J.S. Stanley, Hunter Pauker, Erin L. Kuker, Vy M. Dong, Robert J. Nielsen, Jenny Y. Yang, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404542107

                Efficient CO2 utilization is a critical component of closing the anthropogenic carbon cycle. Most studies have focused on using pure streams of CO2. However, CO2 is generally only available in dilute streams, which requires capture by sorbents followed by energy intensive regeneration to release concentrated CO2. Direct utilization of sorbed-CO2 avoids the costly regeneration step. Furthermore, the sorbent-CO2 interaction can kinetically activate CO2 and tune its reactivity to access products that could otherwise be inaccessible with direct CO2 reduction. We demonstrate that an N-heterocyclic carbene, 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene (DPIy), can capture CO2 from dilute streams (0.04% and 10%) to form 1,3-bis(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)imidazolium-2-carboxylate (DPICx) quantitatively. Electrocatalyst iron tetraphenylporphyrin chloride (Fe(TPP)Cl) typically reduces CO2 to CO; however, with DPICx as the substrate, the 8-electron reduced product methane (CH4) is produced with high (&gt;85%) Faradaic efficiency and regeneration of the sorbent DPIy. In addition to the overall energy and capital advantages of integrated CO2 capture and conversion, these studies illustrate how sorbents can serve a dual purpose for both CO2 capture and chemical auxiliary to access unique products. CO2 has a spectrum of reactivity with different types of sorbents; these results reveal how sorbent-CO2 interactions can be leveraged for integrated capture and utilization platforms to access a wider range of CO2-derived products.</description>

                Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction is emerging as a promising technology to address anthropogenic carbon emissions, with the searching of effective catalysts being the primary barrier toward industrial implementation. This review starts from the long-standing debates over the role of subsurface oxygen and positively charged metal sites (M&#948;+) within oxide-derived catalysts. Thereafter, we focus on the strategy of constructing metal&#8211;metal oxide hybrid catalysts, which is enriched with M1&#8211;O&#8211;M2 heterojunctions that capable of maintaining a positive valence state of active sites and improving CO2 reduction performance. Specifically, advances in metal&#8211;metal oxide hybrid catalysts for CO2-to-C1 conversions are overviewed for selective CO, formate, or CH4 production, respectively. Thereafter, we summarize the interfacial engineering approaches for Cu/MOx hybrid catalysts aimed at selective C2+ production, including the interfacial boundary density, the morphology effect of MOx support, the choice of MOx, and their interaction manipulation with Cu sites. This review concludes with an outlook on the challenges and future directions for developing precisely controlled hybrid catalysts with an in-depth understanding of structure&#8211;performance relationship. Continued interdisciplinary collaborations from materials science, surface chemistry, analytical methodology, and theoretical modeling will be pivotal in overcoming existing challenges and pushing the frontiers of CO2 reduction research.</description>

      <title>Novel heterogeneous photocatalysts for the generation of H2O2 and CO2-reductions</title>

                Photocatalytic methods offer a sustainable approach to chemical production, reducing reliance on non-renewable energy sources and addressing climate change. Traditional H2O2 production often involves hazardous chemicals, while photocatalysis is cleaner and generates fewer by-products. Similarly, rising CO2 levels from fossil fuel combustion contribute to global warming, making photocatalytic CO2 reduction via Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) a promising solution by repurposing CO2 into useful products. Chapter 1 introduced novel semiconductor photocatalysts including their syntheses strategies and their photocatalytic applications. This chapter subsequently introduced the photocatalytic production of H2O2 and the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. It covered the discussion of associated reaction mechanism, the preparation and performance of catalysts, as well as practical applications such as the production of H2O2 from seawater and the reduction of CO2 from exhaust gases. Finally, the challenges and aims of these works was discussed. Chapter 2 presented a BiOBr-lignin composite photocatalyst which was designed for producing H2O2 directly from seawater. Various characterization techniques revealed the structural morphological and optical properties of the photocatalyst. The presence of lignin not only provided structural support but also lowered the reduction potential of the catalyst. Furthermore, the functional groups in the lignin acted as an electron sink upon ionization with metal ions present in the seawater, facilitated through Bronsted-Lowry base proton abstraction. The study delved into the oxygen reduction reaction mechanisms involved in the photocatalytic process. Chapter 3 discussed a Mn-based single atom photocatalyst which were designed for the efficient production of H2O2 directly from seawater through the water oxidation reaction. Advanced characterization techniques and multiscale molecular modeling revealed the structural morphological and electronic properties of the Mn-photocatalyst. The research was delved into the mechanism of the water oxidation reaction. It was found that the atomically dispersed Mn centers played a crucial role in promoting the formation of hydroxy radical (&#8226;OH), which was essential intermediates in the production of H2O2. Chapter 4 focused on an iron-based photocatalyst which has been designed for converting impure CO2 streams into valuable products as part of the carbon capture and utilization (CCU) approach. This catalyst demonstrated an impressive production rate of 145 mmol g-1 h-1 for CO generation, highlighting its efficiency in utilizing sunlight for chemical transformation. The comprehensive characterization, mechanistic insights, and impressive performance metrics underscore its potential for practical applications in carbon capture and utilization strategies.</description>

                One of the most promising approaches in solving the energy crisis and reducing atmospheric CO2 emissions is artificial photosynthetic CO2 reduction. The electrochemical method for CO2 reduction is more appealing since it can be operated under ambient conditions, and the product selectivity strongly depends on the applied potential. Perovskites with ferroelectric properties strongly adsorb linear CO2 molecules. In this study, barium titanate (BaTiO3) perovskite is used as an electrocatalyst to promote CO2 activation and conversion to CO. Perovskite catalysts were prepared by ball&#8208;milling followed by annealing at 900 &#176;C for 4 to 6 h in an open atmosphere. The TEM and SEM study shows that the particle size varies in the range of 80&#8208;200 nm. Mixed phases of BaTiO3 and BaTi5O11 supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes are found to be highly active for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO with maximum Faradaic efficiency of 89.4% at &#8208;1.0 V versus Ag/AgCl in CO2 saturated 0.5 KOH solution. This study concludes that mixed phases of BaTiO3 and BaTi5O11 are more active and highly selective for CO2 conversion to CO compared to single&#8208;phase BaTiO3.</description>

                Producing ethylene (C2H4) from carbon dioxide (CO2) photoreduction under mild conditions is primarily restricted by the difficulty of C&#8722;C coupling. Herein, we designed highly active metal atom clusters anchored on semiconductor nanosheet, which established heteroatom sites on the interface to steer C&#8722;C coupling, realizing air&#8208;concentration CO2 photoreduction into C2H4 in pure water for the first time. As an example, the Pd nanoclusters loaded on ZnO nanosheets are prepared, demonstrated by the X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field image. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the C&#8722;C coupling step over the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets, while quasi in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy illustrates the active sites of Pd and Zn atoms on the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets during CO2 photoreduction. Density functional theoretical calculations unveil the transition state energy barrier of C&#8211;C coupling of CO* and COH* intermediates are only 0.998 eV, hinting the easy C&#8211;C coupling to produce C2 fuels. Therefore, the Pd&#8208;ZnO nanosheets first realize C2H4 photosynthesis by atmospheric&#8208;concentration CO2 reduction with the formation rate of 1.03 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, while the ZnO nanosheets only acquired the carbon monoxide product.</description>

      <title>Why Including Solvation is Paramount: First&#8208;Principles Calculations of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to CO on a Cu Electrocatalyst</title>

                Electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (eCO2RR) to produce valuable chemicals offers an attractive strategy to solve energy and environmental problems simultaneously. We have mapped out entire reaction pathways of eCO2RR to CO on Cu(100), including all intermediates and transition states using first&#8208;principles simulations. To accurately account for the solvent effect, the reaction was investigated with and without explicit water molecules, highlighting the limitations of the often (mis)used vacuum reaction pathway simplification. The results show that the reduction reaction was initiated under neutral pH conditions at an applied potential of &#8211;0.11 V (RHE, reversible hydrogen electrode) and all elementary reactions were thermodynamically favorable, while an applied potential of &#8211;1.24 V is required to ensure that all reactions exhibit spontaneous behavior. Detailed analysis revealed that solvation significantly influences the stability of the adsorbates and intermediates. Its inclusion notably alters the calculated reaction kinetics and energetic parameters by lowering the barrier energies and Gibbs free energies of all reactions. CO production proceeded mainly via the COOH* pathway (CO2&#8208;&#8208;&gt;trans&#8208;COOH*&#8208;&#8208;&gt;cis&#8208;COOH*&#8208;&#8208;&gt;CO*+OH*&#8208;&#8208;&gt;CO*&#8208;&#8208;&gt;CO). The use of water as a more sustainable and cost&#8208;effective solvent is compared to other options such as organic solvents, ionic liquids and mixed solvent systems, which are less sustainable and more expensive.</description>

      <title>A Study on the Carbon Dioxide Laser</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.22214/ijraset.2024.65343</link>
      <description>Muhammad Arif Bin Jalil, International Journal for Research in Applied Science and Engineering Technology. 12(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404527968

                Abstract: One of the first gas lasers to be created was the carbon-dioxide laser (CO2 laser). One of the most practical kinds of lasers, it was created in 1964 by Bell Labs' Kumar Patel [22]. The most powerful continuous-wave lasers on the market right now are carbon-dioxide lasers. Additionally, they are quite efficient; the output power to pump power ratio can reach 20%. The primary wavelength bands of the infrared light beam produced by the CO2 laser are 9.6 and 10.6 micrometers (&#956;m). [22] In order to improve its performance, a carbon dioxide laser uses carbon dioxide as its main gain medium. Nitrogen (N2), helium (He), and occasionally hydrogen (H2), water vapor, oxygen, or xenon (Xe) are added. This laser works by energizing the gas mixture to produce laser light by promoting the emission of radiation by an electrical gas discharge. In carbon dioxide lasers, the electrical gas discharge can be powered by radio frequency (RF), direct current (DC), or alternating current (AC). The wavelength of the light emitted by these lasers is 10.6 micrometers. In dermatology, they are frequently used for operations like wrinkle reduction, scar removal, and sun damage treatment. Furthermore, for accurate cutting and tissue removal, carbon dioxide lasers are employed as surgical instruments in specialties such as neurosurgery and gynecology.[24]</description>

                Abstract Electrifying on-road trucking is a strategy for decarbonizing the transportation sector. While battery-electric trucks have zero tailpipe emissions, the associated increase in electric sector grid emissions would offset a portion of on-road emission reductions. We utilize a techno-economic energy systems optimization model to assess the system-wide carbon dioxide (CO2) and air pollutant emissions implications of medium- and heavy-duty truck electrification in the United States. Results suggest that transitioning to 100% battery electric medium- and heavy-duty vehicle sales by 2050 would result in net CO2 emission benefits should the electric sector is decarbonizing simultaneously. Combining a tax of $100 per ton of CO2, increasing at 5% per year, with electrification targets would yield a net 52% reduction in energy system CO2 emissions in 2050. Across regions, transportation sector NOX emissions &#8211; an ozone precursor - further decreases by 9-26% compared to BAU level in 2050. The level of emission reductions and extend of transportation decarbonization are driven by vehicle cost and performance projections along with underlying assumptions on time of charging.</description>

      <title>Space-Confined Molecular Catalysis toward Electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction on Metal Phthalocyanine@Nitrogen-Doped Carbon Nanosheet</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.4c05280</link>
      <description>Hongbing Zheng, Haoran Wu, Liming Qiu, Mingyao Yu, Jiajun Zhou, Hui Xu, Chunmei Lv, Pengfei Tian, Jitong Wang, Licheng Ling, ACS Applied Nano Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404589193

                Phthalocyanines have emerged as attractive materials for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. However, the challenge of finding a support that is stable while maintaining catalytic activity and loading remains elusive. Porous carbon materials are considered reliable substrates for supporting molecular catalysts. Herein, a nitrogen-rich carbon nanosheet (NiPc/NMCN) with multilayer and mesoporous structure is synthesized based on a kinetically controlled self-assembly strategy and used for phthalocyanine loading. The multilayer composite structure of NMCN guides the molecular-scale dispersion of phthalocyanine and plays a crucial role in its catalytic process. Moreover, the phthalocyanine molecules retain their metal-N4 structure after impregnation. Therefore, the remarkable CO2 electroreduction properties of phthalocyanine are fully demonstrated. At &#8722;0.73 V vs. RHE, NiPc/NMCN achieves the highest CO faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 96.0%. Meanwhile, current densities in membrane electrode module electrolyzers can reach industrial amperage levels, while the FEco remains at 60% at 880 mA cm&#8211;2. Density functional theory (DFT) indicates that the high performance of NiPc/NMCN is attributed to the significant reduction of the CO2RR energy barrier. Phthalocyanines restricted by the porous carbon could produce the intermediate *COOH more rapidly, determining high CO2RR selectivity, which is confirmed by in situ (FTIR) spectroscopy. Consequently, the strategy of constructing confined multilayer mesoporous carbon structures provides an avenue for the design of efficient CO2 reduction molecular catalysts.</description>

      <title>Insight into Carbon Emissions in Economically Developed Regions Based on Land Use Transitions: A Case Study of the Yangtze River Delta, China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/land13111968</link>
      <description>Yu Li, Yanjun Zhang, Xiaoyan Li, Land. 13(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404533737

                This study focused on the land use (LU) structure and carbon emissions (CEs) in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Shanghai provinces of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in China from 2000 to 2020, using the STIRPAT model and scenario analysis (SA). We conducted an analysis of the influence exerted by relevant factors on land use carbon emissions (LUCEs) and made forecasts regarding the diverse development scenarios of CE trends, aiming to provide methodological guidance for validating the effectiveness of existing policies in reducing CEs and offer direction for achieving the peak CO2 emissions target as soon as possible. It also constitutes a significant reference for the early realization of the peak CO2 emissions target. The results indicated the following: (1) Between 2000 and 2020, CEs resulting from LU in the YRD rose from 2.70 &#215; 108 t to 9.10 &#215; 108 t, marking an increase of 243.77%. In 2020, the built-up area was the predominant contributor to CEs, representing 99.15% of the overall carbon sources, whereas forests served as the main carbon sink, comprising 92.37% of the total carbon sinks (CSs) for that year. (2) For each percent increase in the parameters considered in this study, the corresponding increases in LU CO2 emissions were estimated to be: 1.932% (population), 0.241% (GDP per capita), &#8722;0.141% (energy intensity), 0.043% (consumption structure), 1.045% (industrial structure), and 0.975% (urbanization). (3) According to the existing policy framework and development plans, the YRD is expected to achieve peaking carbon dioxide emissions by 2030. If energy conservation and carbon reduction strategies are implemented, this peak could be achieved as early as 2025. However, if economic growth continues to depend primarily on fossil fuel consumption, the region may not hit its carbon peak until 2035. (4) The low-carbon scenario, which considers the needs of social progress alongside the intensity of carbon emission reductions, represents the most effective development strategy for reaching a carbon peak in LU within the YRD. Effectively managing population size and facilitating the upgrading of industrial structures are key strategies to hasten the achievement of peaking carbon dioxide emissions in the region.</description>

      <title>Effect of Female Population, Urbanization and Trade Openness on Carbon Dioxide Emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.38142/ijesss.v5i1.319</link>

                The agenda to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in order to mitigate climate change remains a global concern. Researchers, policymakers and governments have shown interest in this regard. While empirical studies on the subject matter has been increasing conflicting results and little evidence on the effects of some variables necessitate for further studies. In this study the effect of female population, urbanization and trade openness on carbon dioxide emission in Ghana is assessed. The study used the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, &amp; Technology (STIRPAT) model as the foundation for empirical modelling. Time series data spanning from 1971-2018 was used for regression analysis. In both long run and short run periods, urbanization was noted to exert positive influence on carbon dioxide emission while trade openness and female population exert negative effect on carbon dioxide emission. Thus, growth in urbanization increases carbon dioxide emission while the opposite is the case for trade openness and female population. Findings from the study suggest intensifying the empowerment of women could be a crucial catalyst for the achievement of Ghana&#8217;s nationally determined contributions toward CO2 reduction. Also, trade negotiations that promote environmental protection should not be relaxed</description>

      <title>Public demand for carbon capture and storage varies with information, development magnitude and prior familiarity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01900-y</link>
      <description>Jiwon Kim, Jacob Ladenburg, Communications Earth &amp; Environment. 5(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404672587

                Carbon capture and storage is vital to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, albeit research on the public willingness to pay for it remains limited. Here we address this gap by considering information effects, development magnitude effects and prior familiarity relations on willingness to pay towards carbon capture and storage. Based on national-wide online survey targeting Danish public, conducted from June to August 2022, the contingent valuation method is employed. The study reveals that, irrespective of CO2 reduction goals, enhancing familiarity with carbon capture storage can influence public support. Additionally, we estimate willingness to pay elasticities related to development magnitude using a scope test, ensuring economic significance and validity of our findings. Ultimately, this study provides valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders, supporting and enabling the design of effective strategies to promote public support for carbon capture and storage, and contribute to global climate change mitigation efforts. Regardless of Denmark's carbon dioxide emission reduction goal, knowledge and familiarity influence public support and willingness to pay for carbon capture and storage, according to an online survey and econometric model analysis.</description>

      <title>Strategies for Minimizing Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Agriculture through Sustainable Practices</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.9734/jabb/2024/v27i111700</link>
      <description>Sahil Raj, Yumkhaibam Ambika Devi, Munish Kaundal, Journal of Advances in Biology &amp; Biotechnology. 27(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404640898

                The growing global population has resulted in an increased demand for agricultural products. The second-largest source of releases of greenhouse gases is agriculture, which includes land use, agricultural production, and animal husbandry. Consequently, there has been a rise in GHG emissions. The three main greenhouse pollutants (often referred to as GHGs) that are contributing to the phenomenon of global warming and its many catastrophic effects are carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4). Despite being generated in lesser amounts than the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and the gases nitrous oxide (N2O) have a higher potential to contribute to global warming. This paper presents an extensive review on the factors affecting greenhouse gas emissions, including organic (crop species, animal dung, composted manure, and biosolids) and inorganic (such as fertilizers containing phosphate, nitrogen, and potassium) variables. Major sources of agricultural GHG emissions include agricultural soils, field burning of agricultural wastes, enteric fermentation, manure management, and liming. Strategies to mitigate GHG emissions from agriculture encompass improving crop residue management, enhancing nitrogen use efficiency in plants, optimizing nutrient management, implementing sustainable livestock production and feeding practices, adopting climate-smart agriculture, and reducing methane emissions. This paper deals with the future trends in carbon reduction.</description>

      <title>Activation of CO2, CS2, and COS by &#945;&#8208;Diimine&#8208;stabilized Gallylenes</title>

                Several gallylenes [LPhGaM(THF)n] stabilized by an &#945;&#8208;diimine ligand (LPh = [(2,6&#8208;iPr2C6H3)NC(Ph)]2; M = Li, n = 3, 3&#8208;Li; M = Na, n = 4, 3&#8208;Na; M = K, n = 1, 3&#8208;K) were prepared, which display diverse reactivities toward carbon dioxide and its sulfurized analogues. The reaction of 3 with CO2 yielded a trimeric carbonate complex [{LPhGa(CO3)2}3{&#956;&#8208;K9(THF)6}] (4) and a dinuclear oxo&#8208;carbonate complex {K2(THF)6}[LPhGa(&#956;&#8208;CO3)(&#956;&#8208;O)GaLPh] (5) in one pot through reductive disproportionation of CO2. For CS2, two ethenetetrathiolate gallium complexes, [M2(Solv)4][LPhGa(&#956;&#8208;C2S4)GaLPh] (M = Na, Solv = THF, 6; M = K, Solv = DME, 7), were obtained via reductive coupling of CS2. In the case of COS, disproportionation gave a disulfide&#8208;bridged complex [K2(THF)5] [LPhGa(&#956;&#8208;S)2GaLPh] (8) at room temperature, but a dithiocarbonate [Na2(THF)6][LPhGa(S2CO)]2 (9) at low temperature, the latter being the first example of dithiocarbonates of p&#8208;block elements.</description>

      <title>Carbon Negative Synthesis of Amino Acids Using a Cell-Free-Based Biocatalyst</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.4c00359</link>
      <description>Shaafique Chowdhury, Ray Westenberg, Kimberly Wennerholm, Ryan Cardiff, Alexander S. Beliaev, Vincent Noireaux, James M. Carothers, Pamela Peralta&#8208;Yahya, ACS Synthetic Biology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404587269

                Biological systems can directly upgrade carbon dioxide (CO2) into chemicals. The CO2 fixation rate of autotrophic organisms, however, is too slow for industrial utility, and the breadth of engineered metabolic pathways for the synthesis of value-added chemicals is too limited. Biotechnology workhorse organisms with extensively engineered metabolic pathways have recently been engineered for CO2 fixation. Yet, their low carbon fixation rate, compounded by the fact that living organisms split their carbon between cell growth and chemical synthesis, has led to only cell growth with no chemical synthesis achieved to date. Here, we engineer a lysate-based cell-free expression (CFE)-based multienzyme biocatalyst for the carbon negative synthesis of the industrially relevant amino acids glycine and serine from CO2 equivalents&#9472;formate and bicarbonate&#9472;and ammonia. The formate-to-serine biocatalyst leverages tetrahydrofolate (THF)-dependent formate fixation, reductive glycine synthesis, serine synthesis, and phosphite dehydrogenase-dependent NAD(P)H regeneration to convert 30% of formate into serine and glycine, surpassing the previous 22% conversion using a purified enzyme system. We find that (1) the CFE-based biocatalyst is active even after 200-fold dilution, enabling higher substrate loading and product synthesis without incurring additional cell lysate cost, (2) NAD(P)H regeneration is pivotal to driving forward reactions close to thermodynamic equilibrium, (3) balancing the ratio of the formate-to-serine pathway genes added to the CFE is key to improving amino acid synthesis, and (4) efficient THF recycling enables lowering the loading of this cofactor, reducing the cost of the CFE-based biocatalyst. To our knowledge, this is the first synthesis of amino acids that can capture CO2 equivalents for the carbon negative synthesis of amino acids using a CFE-based biocatalyst. Looking ahead, the CFE-based biocatalyst process could be extended beyond serine to pyruvate, a key intermediate, to access a variety of chemicals from aromatics and terpenes to alcohols and polymers.</description>

      <title>CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Microbubbles in Silicone Oil (Part II: Henry&#8217;s Constant and Anomalous Diffusion)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c02020</link>
      <description>A. D&#8217;Onofrio, V. M. Freytes, Langmuir. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404640014

                This work demonstrates the utility of microfluidic devices for characterizing diffusion mechanisms. We determined Henry's constant and characterized the diffusion process of gaseous CO2 in silicone oil. Using microfluidic techniques, we analyzed the evolution of the CO2 bubble size in a solvent flowing through a microchannel system. The reduction in bubble size due to the mass transfer of gaseous CO2 into the solvent fluid primarily affects their length. A microfluidic device was used to produce bubbles, consisting of a pressure-driven injection system for the gas and a flow-driven system for the liquid. Additionally, an optical device was coupled for tracking and studying the bubbles in the microchannels, enabling us to study their spatial and temporal evolution using image analysis. From this study, we found two diffusion regimes. The first is a superdiffusive process for short times. In this regime, due to the high concentration gradient values at the gas&#8211;liquid interface, we observed a higher rate of carbon dioxide transfer to the silicone oil. At longer times, we see that the gas transfer rate significantly decreases compared to the previous regime, leading to a subdiffusive process. In this latter regime, it was found that if we increase the gas pressure, the system approaches a normal diffusive process that coincides with previously conducted studies by other researchers. It is suggested that the subdiffusion could be due to the high degree of confinement of the bubbles within the microchannel, similar to what occurs in porous media, the high viscosity of the fluid, and the low gas pressure used in the tests. The microfluidic device proved to be a very efficient method for determining the diffusion process and Henry's constant in this case. Its easy fabrication and low cost make this type of device appropriate for substance characterization.</description>

                The objective of this work is the study of gas microbubble dissolution in a carrier liquid. To achieve this, we will analyze, using microfluidic techniques, the formation and evolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas microbubbles in silicone oil, monitoring the size, position, and distance between the formed bubbles as they advance through a microchannel. This work consists of two parts (Part I and Part II): in Part I, we analyze the mechanisms determining the variation in the spatial frequency of bubbles as they move through the microchannel, while Part II examines the evolution of their size and demonstrates the utility of the device for obtaining diffusion coefficients and Henry's constant for the gases used. The microchip containing the microchannels has a serpentine shape, allowing extensive bubble trajectories to be captured in a single image. Regarding the study of bubble spatial frequency (Part I), it was found to exhibit three regimes during its displacement through the microchannel. Initially, the frequency increases because the bubbles block the microchannel, preventing liquid transfer through the residual film formed between the channel wall and the gas. Then, there is a transition stage during which the liquid manages to penetrate the residual film due to a local increase in pressure gradient. The pressure gradient overcomes the reduction in film thickness due to the decrease in carrier phase flow rate, which is affected by gas dissolution in the liquid. Therefore, the frequency begins to stabilize until the bubbles lose contact with the microchannel wall and assume a spherical shape, being transported at the carrier liquid velocity. These studies contribute to the understanding of transport phenomena and interfaces in CO2 foams in oils, which are of great interest in industries such as oil recovery and refrigerants.</description>

                Abstract. Previous phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) have primarily focused on simulations driven by atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs), for both idealized model experiments and climate projections of different emissions scenarios. We argue that although this approach was practical to allow parallel development of Earth system model simulations and detailed socioeconomic futures, carbon cycle uncertainty as represented by diverse, process-resolving Earth system models (ESMs) is not manifested in the scenario outcomes, thus omitting a dominant source of uncertainty in meeting the Paris Agreement. Mitigation policy is defined in terms of human activity (including emissions), with strategies varying in their timing of net-zero emissions, the balance of mitigation effort between short-lived and long-lived climate forcers, their reliance on land use strategy, and the extent and timing of carbon removals. To explore the response to these drivers, ESMs need to explicitly represent complete cycles of major GHGs, including natural processes and anthropogenic influences. Carbon removal and sequestration strategies, which rely on proposed human management of natural systems, are currently calculated in integrated assessment models (IAMs) during scenario development with only the net carbon emissions passed to the ESM. However, proper accounting of the coupled system impacts of and feedback on such interventions requires explicit process representation in ESMs to build self-consistent physical representations of their potential effectiveness and risks under climate change. We propose that CMIP7 efforts prioritize simulations driven by CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use and projected deployment of carbon dioxide removal technologies, as well as land use and management, using the process resolution allowed by state-of-the-art ESMs to resolve carbon&#8211;climate feedbacks. Post-CMIP7 ambitions should aim to incorporate modeling of non-CO2 GHGs (in particular, sources and sinks of methane and nitrous oxide) and process-based representation of carbon removal options. These developments will allow three primary benefits: (1) resources to be allocated to policy-relevant climate projections and better real-time information related to the detectability and verification of emissions reductions and their relationship to expected near-term climate impacts, (2) scenario modeling of the range of possible future climate states including Earth system processes and feedbacks that are increasingly well-represented in ESMs, and (3) optimal utilization of the strengths of ESMs in the wider context of climate modeling infrastructure (which includes simple climate models, machine learning approaches and kilometer-scale climate models).</description>

      <title>Impacts of nitrogen fertilizers and nitrification inhibitors on greenhouse gas emissions from soil</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.32469/10355/106123</link>

                [EMBARGOED UNTIL 08/01/2025] This thesis investigates the impact of nitrification inhibitors and varying fertilizer rates on greenhouse gas emissions and crop yield in agricultural systems. Fertilized agricultural soils can experience notable losses of nitrogen gases, such as nitrous oxide (N2O) and ammonia (NH3) after the application of nitrogen (N) fertilizers. In the Midwest U.S., anhydrous ammonia and urea are common nitrogen sources used in corn cropping systems. Nitrification inhibitors pronitridine and dicyandiamide (DCD) have demonstrated potential to enhance corn grain yield when applied with N fertilizer. The first chapter explores the efficacy of pronitridine in reducing N2O and NH3 emissions from corn fields fertilized with anhydrous ammonia. Results from field trials conducted in Northeast Missouri over two growing seasons indicated that while pronitridine did not significantly reduce cumulative NH3 emissions in both seasons, it lowered N2O emissions from higher fertilizer rates in the 2023 growing season. Grain yield increased with fertilizer rate and the addition of pronitridine. Overall, we found that pronitridine did not affect cumulative N2O and NH3 emissions (outside of 202N fertilizer rate for N2O in 2023) but has the potential to increase grain yield. The second chapter examines the effects of urea fertilizer and DCD on N2O, NH3, carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) in bare soil. Findings revealed that increased fertilizer rates led to higher NH3 emissions, while DCD application had a marginal effect on reducing N2O emissions, with greater reductions observed at higher DCD rates. Our data supports other work concluding DCD has the potential to reduce N2O emissions but highlights the potential for greater reductions through increased DCD rates.</description>

                Climate change stands out as a significant environmental issue on a global scale, with greenhouse gases being one of its primary drivers. The greenhouse gas process provides a critical framework for understanding the sources, emissions, and environmental impacts of these gases. This article presents an overview of the fundamental elements of the greenhouse gas process in the textile sector and discusses how it should be managed in line with sustainability goals. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (N2O), and fluorinated gases are the most common greenhouse gases, each derived from different sources. The textile sector is particularly associated with high greenhouse gas emissions, especially in areas such as energy consumption, water usage, and waste management. Therefore, measurements taken in factories are crucial for identifying emission sources and developing reduction strategies. This article examines in detail the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from various activities at K&#305;van&#231; Textile. Energy consumption, particularly the emissions resulting from the fuels used in electricity and heating processes, is evaluated. Additionally, emissions from other important sources such as refrigerant gas leaks, waste management, and transportation are analyzed. The measurement process was carried out in accordance with national and international standards. The greenhouse gas inventory includes data on energy consumption, fuel consumption, refrigerant gas usage, transportation, production process management, and waste management throughout the factory. Based on these data, the total amount and sources of emissions were determined. This study presents a systematic method for calculating a company&#8217;s carbon footprint, with data collected in accordance with national and international standards. Such data can provide a reference point for other companies when making similar calculations. All of the businesses of the facility where the study was conducted were examined and calculations were made on a total of 1350 employees. As a result of the detailed study, K&#305;van&#231; Textile&#8217;s corporate carbon footprint for 2023 was calculated as a total of 68,746.86 tons CO2e. According to this data obtained, K&#305;van&#231; Textile emitted 50.92 tons of CO2e greenhouse gases per employee. At the same time, it was determined that the production in 2023 was 4,427,082 tons and a greenhouse gas emission of 15.53 tons of CO2e per production (ton) was calculated. This study also includes proposed strategies for reducing emissions. These strategies include energy efficiency measures, the use of renewable energy sources, waste reduction, and the adoption of efficient production processes. In conclusion, this article emphasizes the importance of efforts to measure and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in textile factories. K&#305;van&#231; Textile&#8217;s greenhouse gas measurements provide a fundamental reference for achieving sustainability goals in the sector. The data obtained will support the factory&#8217;s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and minimize its environmental impacts.</description>

      <title>Provincial inequalities in life cycle carbon dioxide emissions and air pollutants from electric vehicles in China</title>

                It is still unclear whether emissions reductions from electric vehicles can be achieved across different regions from a lifecycle perspective. Here we use the life cycle assessment model and Quasi Input-Output model to evaluate the carbon dioxide emissions and air pollutants of internal combustion engine vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles in different provinces of China, with the provincial electricity consumption data and the sales data of electric vehicles. We find that battery electric vehicles have achieved 11.8% and 1.1% reduction in carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, respectively, compared to internal combustion engine vehicles. In contrast, the emissions of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter 2.5 increased by 10% and 20%, respectively. Due to the coal-based power generation structure and the cold weather, the emission intensity of battery electric vehicles in most northern provinces is higher than that in southern provinces. From 2020 to 2030, improving technological progress and optimizing electricity mix will greatly assist in achieving emissions reduction. The results can help policy-makers better understand the emission characteristics and reasonably plan future emission reduction strategies in transportation. The emission intensities of carbon dioxide and air pollutants from battery electric vehicles are high in northern provinces of China due to the coal-based electricity mix and cold weather, according to an analysis that uses a life cycle assessment model and data on electricity generation.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of Combustion and Emission Characteristics of the Single-Cylinder Diesel Engine Fueled with Diesel-Ammonia Mixture</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17225782</link>
      <description>A. F. Ali, Ocktaeck Lim, Energies. 17(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404546669

                This study proposes a dual-fuel approach combining diesel and ammonia in a single-cylinder compression ignition engine to reduce harmful emissions from internal combustion. Diesel is directly injected into the combustion chamber, while ammonia is introduced through the intake manifold with intake air. In this study, injection timing and the percentage of ammonia energy fraction was varied. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model simulates the combustion and emission processes to assess the impact of varying diesel injection timings and ammonia energy contributions. Findings indicate that as ammonia content increases, the engine experiences reductions in peak in-cylinder pressure, temperature, heat release rate, as well as overall efficiency and power output. Emission results suggest that greater ammonia usage leads to a reduction in soot, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and unburned hydrocarbons, though a slight increase in nitrogen oxides emissions is observed. This analysis supports ammonia&#8217;s potential as a low-emission alternative fuel in future compression ignition engines.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the performance and life cycle assessment of alkali-activated sintered sludge-slag-based permeable concrete</title>

                As urbanization continues to accelerate, the application of permeable concrete is becoming an increasingly prevalent practice. Nevertheless, the carbon dioxide emission issue associated with traditional permeable concrete cannot be overlooked. In this study, alkali-activated sintered sludge and slag were employed as raw materials to prepare alkali-activated sintered sludge-slag-based permeable concrete. The effects of sludge calcination temperature, sludge content, and binder-to-aggregate ratio on the compressive strength, porosity, and permeability coefficient of the permeable concrete were investigated through the implementation of one-way experiments. The formation mechanism of permeable concrete materials was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and a carbon emission assessment was performed. The findings indicated that an increase in sludge content resulted in a notable decline in the 28-day compressive strength, accompanied by a reduction in the Ca/Si ratio of the C-A-S-H hydration products, from 1.08 to 0.35. Conversely, the carbon emission assessment demonstrated that abiotic losses declined markedly with an increase in sludge content, effectively mitigating the carbon emission burden associated with construction materials.</description>

- 86,34%. The publication discusses the features of the technology of extracting oil from coriander seeds - both traditional and new (using carbon dioxide). The theoretical aspects of the application of carbon dioxide as an extractant in the precritical (liquid) and supercritical (fluid) states are considered in connection with the extraction of vegetable oils and other components from plant raw materials. It is shown that in the process of extraction by both kinds of a solvent of fatty oil from an oilseed raw material, the initial properties of the oil, evaluated by its fatty acid composition, are preserved. Analysis of the data on the fractional composition of coriander meal proteins shows that for both extraction variants, the content of the water-soluble fraction of proteins in the meal (the most valuable from the point of view of fodder assimilation), as compared with its content in the corresponding initial samples, is reduced. It is noted that for another valuable fraction of proteins - soluble, another tendency is observed: in comparison with its content in the initial samples, the process of liquid extraction causes its reduction, and supercritical - an increase. The yield of fatty coriander oil was 68.47% for extraction with liquid carbon dioxide, and 86.34% for extraction with fluid.</description>

      <title>Improved estimates of net ecosystem exchanges in mega-countries using GOSAT and OCO-2 observations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-024-01910-w</link>

                Accurate national terrestrial net ecosystem exchange estimates are crucial for the global stocktake. Net ecosystem exchange estimates from different inversion models vary greatly at national scale, and the relative impacts of prior fluxes and observations on these inversions remain unclear. Here we estimate the net ecosystem exchange of 51 land regions for the 2017-2019 period, focusing on the 10 largest countries, using prior fluxes from 12 terrestrial biosphere models and XCO2 retrievals from GOSAT and OCO-2 satellites as constraints. The average uncertainty reduction for the 10 countries increases from 37% with GOSAT and 45% with OCO-2 to 50% with combined observations, indicating a trend towards robust estimates. At finer spatial scales, even with combined observations, the uncertainty reduction is only 33%, i.e., the prior flux dominates the estimates. This finding underscores the critical importance of integrating multi-source observations and refining prior fluxes to improve the accuracy of carbon flux estimates. Choice of ecosystem model and input satellite data has a significant impact on modelled carbon dioxide flux and its associated uncertainty for large countries, according to atmospheric inversions using GOSAT and OCO-2 data.</description>

                The search for low-cost, durable, and effective catalysts is essential for green hydrogen production and carbon dioxide upcycling to help in the mitigation of climate change. Discovery of new catalysts is currently limited by the gap between what AI-accelerated computational models predict and what experimental studies produce. To make progress, large and diverse experimental datasets are needed that are reproducible and tested at industrially-relevant conditions. We address these needs by utilizing a comprehensive high-throughput characterization and experimental pipeline to create the Open Catalyst Experiments 2024 (OCX24) dataset. The dataset contains 572 samples synthesized using both wet and dry methods with X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction characterization. We prepared 441 gas diffusion electrodes, including replicates, and evaluated them using zero-gap electrolysis for carbon dioxide reduction (CO$_2$RR) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at current densities up to $300$ mA/cm$^2$. To find correlations with experimental outcomes and to perform computational screens, DFT-verified adsorption energies for six adsorbates were calculated on $\sim$20,000 inorganic materials requiring 685 million AI-accelerated relaxations. Remarkably from this large set of materials, a data driven Sabatier volcano independently identified Pt as being a top candidate for HER without having any experimental measurements on Pt or Pt-alloy samples. We anticipate the availability of experimental data generated specifically for AI training, such as OCX24, will significantly improve the utility of computational models in selecting materials for experimental screening.</description>

                Abstract Synthesis of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) from carbon dioxide (CO2) is a representative pathway for CO2 resource utilisation, which can effectively reduce atmospheric CO2 levels. CeZrO2 can effectively catalyse the generation of dimethyl carbonate (DMC) by direct reaction of carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) and methanol (MeOH). However, its morphologically controllable synthesis and resolution of particle agglomeration remain a challenge. In this paper, uniformly dispersed rod-like structures were synthesised by adjusting the composition of the reaction solvent during CeZrO2 synthesis. Experiments and characterisation showed that the addition of alcohol directly affected the morphology and aggregation of ions in solution and promoted the reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+, thus improving the catalytic performance of rod-shaped CeZrO2. When n-butanol was added at an alcohol-to-water ratio of 1/1, the generation of DMC has been optimised at 4.36 mmol/g, which was about 10% higher than the performance of DMC from a single aqueous solution. In this work, a simple, efficient and rapid modification method was used to achieve the improvement of catalyst performance, and the modulation of the reaction solvent can effectively reduce the cost of catalyst production compared with the doping modification of the catalyst with metal elements, and this study is an important reference for the optimisation of the performance of other types of catalysts.</description>

                With the increasing concern about global warming and future climate change, attention has been drawn to the need to reduce building energy use through improving buildings&#8217; energy efficiency. Existing residential buildings constitute the largest percentage of energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions, and hence offer significant potential for energy savings and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The review aims to determine the most widely considered energy-efficiency measures for retrofitting existing residential buildings in Mediterranean countries and to determine the research methods and tools adopted in current research work for retrofitting existing residential buildings. This will help to identify potential areas of intervention to improve the energy efficiency of existing residential stock in Libya. This study systematically reviews the literature focusing on energy retrofit in residential buildings in Mediterranean countries, with a particular focus on the Libyan context. Forty- four publications of high relevance to the subject area are analysed under identified themes. The results reveal that while energy retrofitting is a research area of interest in the region considered, studies in a Libyan context are limited. There is also limited attention to achieving net zero energy and embodied carbon reductions, including in the Libyan context. Moreover, some weaknesses are identified for most of the studies reviewed, including those in the Libyan context, related to the credibility and reliability of the energy models.</description>

      <title>Will changing the way of hydrogen production reduce carbon dioxide emissions? Incorporating the power system into a hydrogen production TIMES model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0220559</link>
      <description>Yunfei Han, Xilong Yao, Xiaoyan Qi, Lin Liu, Na Liu, Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy. 16(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404592545

                Low carbon hydrogen production is the key to reducing its CO2 emissions. The electrolysis of water for hydrogen production links the CO2 emissions from the power system with those from hydrogen production. This article incorporates the power system into a hydrogen production Integrated MARKAL-EFOM system model and predicts the impact of hydrogen production methods and power structure on CO2 emissions from hydrogen production in China. The results show that: Under the business as usual scenario, the CO2 emissions from hydrogen production are projected to decline in 2045 and then rebound in 2050. It indicates that the current power structure is difficult to support the further reduction of hidden CO2 emissions in the future electrolysis of water for hydrogen production. Hydrogen production technologies optimization has a greater effect on CO2 emissions reduction in hydrogen production, its effect will gradually weaken, whereas the emission reduction effect of power structure optimization will gradually strengthen. The information presented in this paper could be helpful for researchers and policymakers to correctly consider the coupling relationship between power system and hydrogen system in the long-term energy transformation process.</description>

                Abstract Disclaimer In an effort to expedite the publication of articles, AJHP is posting manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. Purpose The healthcare sector contributes approximately 4% to 5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thereby impacting climate change. Various initiatives, including teleworking, have been considered to mitigate GHG emissions, but their environmental impact remains poorly defined in the healthcare sector. This study aims to evaluate the impact of teleworking by hospital pharmacists on GHG emissions reduction by comparing the actual situation at one Canadian hospital, which includes teleworking shifts from home, to a scenario where all working shifts necessitate travel to the hospital. Methods The study was conducted at the pharmacy department of an academic hospital with 86 pharmacists (75 pharmacist full-time equivalents), between June 1, 2020, and May 31, 2023. Two different online carbon footprint calculators, one developed by the Centres de Gestion des D&#233;placements (CGD) and one available at the website of Carbon Footprint Ltd., were employed to measure mean GHG emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq) for individuals based on their modes of transport and distances traveled between home and work. Results During the study period, teleworking resulted in a significant reduction of mean GHG emissions per pharmacist relative to the scenario of all on-site shifts, with a reduction of 134 kg CO2eq (1,160 CO2eq vs 1,026 CO2eq; t = 3.32; P = 0.0007) estimated with the CGD calculator and a reduction of 135 kg CO2eq (1,117 CO2eq vs 982 CO2eq; t = 4.31; P &amp;lt; 0.0001) estimated with the Carbon Footprint calculator. Those figures correspond to a reduction of 11.5% (11,249 kg CO2eq) to 12.1% (11,315 kg CO2eq) of the total quantity of emissions associated with commuting for the 84 pharmacists over 3 years. The median distance from home to the hospital was 10.0 (8.1) km, with nearly three-quarters of pharmacists commuting by public or active transport. Conclusion Teleworking has a positive environmental impact and could be implemented in other pharmacy departments. The implemented teleworking approach represents an encouraging initial step toward reducing the GHG emissions associated with the travel of employees.</description>

                Microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is a rapidly growing technology at the forefront of sustainable chemistry, leveraging the ability of microorganisms to catalyze electrochemical reactions to synthesize valuable compounds from renewable energy sources. The reduction of CO2 is a major target application for MES, but research in this area has been stifled, especially with the use of direct electron transfer (DET)-based microbial systems. The major fundamental hurdle that needs to be overcome is the low efficiency of CO2 reduction largely attributed to minimal microbial access to CO2 owing to its low solubility in the electrolyte. With their tunable physical properties, ionic liquids present a potential solution to this challenge and have previously shown promise in facilitating efficient CO2 electroreduction by increasing the CO2 solubility. However, the use of ionic liquids in MES remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated the role of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][Ac]) using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 as a model DET strain. Electrochemical investigations demonstrated the ability of S. oneidensis MR-1 biocathodes to directly convert CO2 to formate with a faradaic efficiency of 34.5 &#177; 26.1%. The addition of [EMIM][Ac] to the system significantly increased cathodic current density and enhanced the faradaic efficiency to 94.5 &#177; 4.3% while concurrently amplifying the product yield from 34 &#177; 23 &#956;M to 366 &#177; 34 &#956;M. These findings demonstrate that ionic liquids can serve as efficient, biocompatible cosolvents for microbial electrochemical reduction of CO2 to value-added products, holding promise for more robust applications of MES.</description>

      <title>Anionic Surfactant-Tuned Interfacial Water Reactivity Promoting Electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction</title>

                The effects of the electrical double layer (EDL), which pertain to the compositions and interactions among electrolyte species, significantly impact the catalytic process. There is a pressing need to investigate the role of electrolyte components and to deepen our understanding of EDL effects. In this study, we tune the water activity within a range of anionic surfactants featuring different functional groups to adjust H2 evolution activity and CO2 reduction selectivity. We demonstrate that these anionic surfactants are active in the local reaction environment under a cathodic potential. The enhanced selectivity of CO2 to CO can be attributed to the robust interfacial hydrogen-bonding network reformed by the anionic surfactants. This network diminishes the water dissociation activity and promotes the hydrogenation step in CO2 reduction. Notably, the electrolyte incorporating anionic surfactants improves the CO2 reduction performance, registering CO Faradaic efficiencies of 89.7% (RSO3&#8211;, SDS), 97.5% (RSO4&#8211;, SLS), 98.4% (RPO42&#8211;, SMP), and 98.9% (RCOO&#8211;, SL) at &#8722;1.2 V versus RHE, thereby outperforming the blank KHCO3 electrolyte (53.1%). This research underscores the crucial influence of anionic additives in the CO2RR.</description>

      <title>Pervasive fire danger continued under a negative emission scenario</title>

                Enhanced fire-prone weather under greenhouse gas warming can significantly affect local and global carbon budgets from increased fire occurrence, influencing carbon-climate feedbacks. However, the extent to which changes in fire-prone weather and associated carbon emissions can be mitigated by negative emissions remains uncertain. Here, we analyze fire weather responses in CO2 removal climate model experiments and estimate their potential carbon emissions based on an observational relationship between fire weather and fire-induced CO2 emissions. The results highlight that enhanced fire danger under global warming cannot be restored instantaneously by CO2 reduction, mainly due to atmospheric dryness maintained by climatic inertia. The exacerbated fire danger is projected to contribute to extra CO2 emissions in 68% of global regions due to the hysteresis of climate responses to CO2 levels. These findings highlight that even under global cooling from negative emissions, increased fire activity may reinforce the fire-carbon-climate feedback loop and result in further socio-economic damage. This study shows that increased fire risk under global warming may not decrease in line with CO2 reductions. The exacerbated fire danger is projected to contribute to extra CO2 emissions in 68% of the world due to the hysteresis of climate responses to CO2 levels.</description>

      <title>Cooperative CO2 activation involving a mononuclear aluminum(II) intermediate</title>

                An important aspect of sustainable chemistry research is the discovery of novel chemical mechanisms by which otherwise inert molecules become activated toward useful transformations by earth&#8217;s most abundant elements. Compounds involving the most abundant metal on earth, aluminum, most commonly involve AlIII ions due to their noble gas electronic configurations. Although compounds with AlI ions have also been studied, the chemistry of AlII ions is nearly unknown and may contain undiscovered reaction manifolds. Here, we report the CO2 activation chemistry of an AlII complex supported by a chelating, dianionic ligand and investigate the electronic structure details and reaction mechanisms required to access this reactivity. We found that a heterobinuclear complex, (NON)Al- FeCp(CO)2 (1), undergoes reversible Al-Fe bond homolysis at ambient conditions to reveal the [(NON)Al]&#183;/[CpFe(CO)2]&#183; radical pair in situ. The presence of predominantly Al-centered spin density (i.e., an AlII ion) within this radical pair was established using experiments with radical scavengers as well as electronic structure calculations. Exposure of 1 to CO2 atmosphere resulted in insertion of CO2 into the Al-Fe bond. This net 2-electron CO2 reduction process was computationally modeled using quantum chemical calculations and direct dynamics simulations, revealing that reduction involves two 1-electron steps and, thus, depends on stabilization of high-energy [CO2]&#183; - by coordination to aluminum. This mechanism for CO2 activation is unexpected given the canonical predisposition of CO2 for multi-electron reduction processes and demonstrates the possibility of discovering new reaction profiles of earth- abundant elements in unusual oxidation states.</description>

                Substituting the traditional fuel combustion heating mode in hydrogen production reactors with electric heating demonstrates a significant potential for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. An Ni/Al2O3/Ceramic Foam Electric Heating Catalyst was created using a replication template method and a slurry method. On a reactor with dimensions of &#934;25 &#215; 800 mm, the differences in the heating rate, axial temperature variance, radial temperature variance, and energy consumption between internal and external heating were analyzed. The results show that: (1) By optimizing the structure of the electric heating wires, the temperature uniformity in the catalyst is enhanced; (2) At 650 &#176;C, 3000 h&#8722;1, and S/C = 3, compared to traditional granular catalysts, the internal electric heating reduces the axial temperature variance by 69.4% and the radial temperature variance by 95%; and (3) Achieving a temperature of 650 &#176;C using electric heating only requires 23 min, resulting in a 56.82% reduction in energy consumption compared to external heating.</description>

                In the quest to replace fossil fuels and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, developing energy technologies based on clean catalytic processes is fundamental. However, the cost-effectiveness of these technologies strongly relies on the availability of efficient catalysts made of abundant elements. Herein, this study presents a one-step hydrothermal method to obtain a series of Ni3Se4 nanoparticles with a layer of amorphous selenium on their surface. When employed as electrocatalysts for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), the optimized proper surface Se-coated Ni3Se4 nanoparticles exhibit a high current density of 160 mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.6 V, achieving a high methanol-to-formate Faradaic efficiency above 97.8% and excellent stability with less than 20% current decay after an 18 h chronoamperometry test. This excellent performance is rationalized using density functional theory calculations, which unveil that the electrochemical recombination of SeOx results in a reduction of the energy barrier for the dehydrogenation of methanol during the MOR process.</description>

                The reduction of CO2 to synthetic fuels is a valuable strategy for energy storage. However, the formation of energy&#8208;dense liquid fuels such as methanol remains rare, particularly under low&#8208;temperature and &#8208;pressure conditions that can be coupled to renewable electricity sources via electrochemistry. Here, a multicatalyst system pairing an electrocatalyst with a thermal organometallic catalyst is introduced, which enables the reduction of CO2 to methanol at ambient temperature and pressure. The cascade methanol synthesis proceeds via CO2 reduction to formate by electrocatalyst [Cp*Ir(bpy)Cl]+ (Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl, bpy = 2,2&#8217;&#8208;bipyridine), Fischer esterification of formate to isopropyl formate catalyzed by trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (HOTf), and thermal transfer hydrogenation of isopropyl formate to methanol facilitated by the organometallic catalyst (H&#8208;PNP)Ir(H)3 (H&#8208;PNP = HN(C2H4PiPr2)2). The isopropanol solvent plays several crucial roles: activating formate ion as isopropyl formate, donating hydrogen for the reduction of formate ester to methanol via transfer hydrogenation, and lowering the barrier for transfer hydrogenation through hydrogen bonding interactions. In addition to reporting a method for room&#8208;temperature reduction of challenging ester substrates, this work provides a prototype for pairing electrochemical and thermal organometallic reactions that will guide the design and development of multicatalyst cascades.</description>

                The study examines the friction and wear properties of Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V-Zr-Ni 5 Zr alloys under varying gas conditions. The alloy was tested in the presence of oxygen and carbon dioxide using a controlled atmosphere wear tester. The study revealed that the wear environmental embrittlement resulted from the diffusion of reactive atomic hydrogen into the interior of the Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V alloy. The addition of Zr elements decreased the proportion of Al elements on the surface of the Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V-Zr-Ni 5 Zr alloy and reduced the proportion of H atoms produced by the chemical reaction between atmospheric water vapour and Al elements. This inhibited the environmental embrittlement and improved the performance of the Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V-Zr-Ni 5 Zr alloy. The wear performance of Ni 5 Zr alloy is superior to that of Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V. When exposed to air in an air environment, the surface of Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V-Zr-Ni 5 Zr alloy forms a protective Al 2 O 3 oxide film on the workpiece, resulting in a reduction of the friction coefficient and wear rate of the alloy. The wear mechanism of the alloy is mainly oxidation wear and abrasive wear. In an oxygen environment, the surface of the alloy generates a significant amount of Al 2 O 3 oxide film. The flaking of the oxide film leads to an increase in the friction coefficient and wear rate of the alloy. In a carbon dioxide environment, the surface of the alloy undergoes severe deformation, and plough lines become apparent. This is accompanied by flaking Si 3 N 4 abrasive chips adhering to the surface of the alloy, which intensifies the wear of the alloy. The primary wear mechanism is abrasive wear. Therefore, the friction coefficient and wear rate of the Ni 3 Al-Ni 3 V-Zr-Ni 5 Zr alloy in the atmosphere are optimal.</description>

                ConspectusCarbon-one-unit (C1) feedstocks are generally used in the chemical synthesis of organic molecules, such as solvents, drugs, polymers, and fuels. Contrary to the dangerous and polluting carbon monoxide mostly coming from fossil fuels, formate and formamide are attractive alternative feedstocks for chemical synthesis. As these are currently mainly obtained from the oil industry, novel synthetic routes have been developed based on the transformation of the greenhouse gas CO2. Such developments are motivated by the urgent need for carbon chemical recycling, leading to a sustainable future. The inert nature of CO2 represents a challenge for chemists to activate and specifically convert the molecule through an affordable and efficient process. The chemical transformation could be inspired by biological CO2 activation, in which highly specialized enzymes perform atmospheric CO2 fixation through relatively abundant metal catalysts. In this Account, we describe and discuss the potential of one of the most efficient biological CO2-converting systems: the formylmethanofuran dehydrogenase (abbreviated as FMD).FMDs are multienzymatic complexes found in archaea that capture CO2 as a formyl group branched on the amine moiety of the methanofuran (MFR) cofactor. This overall reaction leading to formyl&#8722;MFR production does not require ATP hydrolysis as compared to the CO2-fixing microbes relying on the reductive Wood&#8211;Ljungdahl pathway, highlighting a different operative mode that saves cellular energy. FMD reaction represents the entry point in hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (H2 and CO2 dependent or formate dependent) and operates in reverse in other methanogenic pathways and microbial metabolisms. Therefore, FMD is a key enzyme in the planetary carbon cycle. After decades of investigations, recent studies have provided a description of the FMD structure, reaction mechanism, and potential for the electroreduction of CO2, to which our laboratory has been actively contributing.FMD is an "all-in-one" enzyme catalyzing a redox-active transformation coupled to a redox-neutral transformation at two very different metal cofactors where new C&#8211;H and C&#8211;N bonds are made. First, the principle of the overall reaction consisting of an exergonic CO2 reduction coupled with an endergonic formate condensation on MFR is resumed. Then, this Account exposes the molecular details of the active sites and provides an overview of each catalytic mechanism. It also describes the natural versatility of electron-delivery modules fueling CO2 reduction and extends it to the possibilities of using artificial systems such as electrodes.A perspective concludes on how the mechanistic of FMD could be applied to produce CO2-based chemical intermediates to synthesize organic molecules. Indeed, through its biochemical properties, the enzyme opens opportunities for CO2 electroreduction to generate molecules such as formate and formamide derivatives, which are all intermediates for synthesizing organic compounds. Transferring the chemical knowledge acquired from these biological systems would provide coherent models that can lead to further development in the field of synthetic biology and bio-inspired synthetic chemistry to perform large-scale CO2 conversion into building blocks for chemical synthesis.</description>

      <title>Policy Coordination Effects of APPCAP and ETS on Pollution and Carbon Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17235819</link>
      <description>Lei Zhu, Siyue Yang, Xinwei Gao, Ruirui Yang, Energies. 17(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404593127

                Coordinated control of pollution and carbon reduction is an imperative choice for China&#8217;s overall transition towards sustainability. However, China&#8217;s environmental policies often treat pollutants and CO2 separately, potentially resulting in imbalanced pollution and carbon reduction. Since several cities are not only critical cities for the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) policy but also pilot cities for the Carbon Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), this study aims to examine the extent to which the policy coordination of APPCAP and ETS can influence air pollutants and CO2 emissions. Using panel data from 2011 to 2019 for China&#8217;s 231 prefecture cities, we compare the pollution and carbon reduction effects of separate and coordinated policy implementation of APPCAP and ETS via the difference-in-differences (DID) model and the causal forest model. Research shows that (1) the policy coordination of APPCAP and ETS has significantly reduced both air pollutants and CO2 emissions in dual-policy pilot cities. For non-dual pilot cities, the separate implementation of APPCAP or ETS only exerts significant unilateral effects. (2) Enhancing government supervision, weakening the relationship between government and enterprises, and raising enterprises&#8217; green innovation capabilities are the main mechanisms through which policy coordination can significantly influence pollution and carbon reduction. (3) The combined implementation impacts of APPCAP and ETS are more evident in pollution-intensive cities and cities with weak carbon-peaking trends. Our research inspires the development of a collaborative system of pollution reduction and carbon reduction policies.</description>

      <title>Variation of Modified Combustion Efficiency and Its Impact on Biomass Burning Emission Estimation in Africa</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2024jd041808</link>
      <description>Xiaosheng Fang, Zilin Wang, Xin Huang, Lian Xue, Wenxuan Hua, Sijia Lou, K. Y. Ding, Aijun Ding, Journal of Geophysical Research Atmospheres. 129(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404687542

                Abstract Biomass burning (BB) is one of the largest sources of trace gases and primary carbonaceous particles in the global troposphere, posing great impacts on air quality and regional climate. Accurate quantification of BB emissions is vital for assessing its environmental and climate impacts. However, there are still large uncertainties in current BB emission inventories due to poorly characterized emission rates under different combustion states. The fixed emission factor (EF) instead of varying EF associated with different combustion efficiencies may be the reason for the bias. Here, based on satellite&#8208;retrieved carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and carbon monoxide (CO), the modified combustion efficiency (MCE) is derived for fire&#8208;prone regions in Africa. The monthly and inter&#8208;annual variability of MCE shows a good correlation with meteorological variables such as relative humidity. Therefore, variable EF was established based on its statistical relationship with MCE for different fire&#8208;emitted species. Application of such MCE&#8208;dependent EF in the global climate&#8208;chemistry model can greatly improve the performance of wildfire smoke pollution during the fire season, indicated by an increase of 31% in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and a 50% reduction in normalized mean bias compared with AOD observations. The study elucidates the critical role of meteorology in BB emission estimates and highlights the importance of implementing a dynamic fire emission inventory in response to meteorological conditions.</description>

                With global warming and climate change becoming more and more serious, countries around the world have begun to pay attention to emission reduction and environmental protection, and the concept of &#8216;dual carbon&#8217; has further penetrated into people's hearts, bringing new opportunities for the export of power lithium batteries from China. This paper aims to conduct a digital analysis of the export trade of the top seven countries (regions) in terms of the volume of power lithium battery trade in China, and to explore the influencing factors of the export volume of power lithium batteries from China. This paper first conducts a contour analysis based on the data fluctuations of five indicators in 32 provinces (excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) from 2019 to 2021: total carbon dioxide emissions (mt), lithium iron phosphate production (10,000 tons), lithium battery electrolyte (10,000 tons), two-wheeled electric vehicles (100,000 vehicles), and lithium battery separators (10,000 tons). The final conclusion is that the &#8216;dual carbon&#8217; background has a significant impact on China's power lithium battery industry. Furthermore, based on a panel data regression model, the factors affecting trade between China and the major countries (regions) exporting power lithium batteries are explored in depth. The results of the analysis found that the power generation, economic freedom, number of charging piles, population size, and per capita GDP of the exporting countries significantly affect the export volume of power lithium batteries in China. Among them, the population size and per capita GDP growth rate of the exporting countries have a negative impact, while the rest have a positive impact on the export volume of power lithium batteries in China.</description>

                The literature suggests that a country&#8217;s economic development is directly related to the efficiency of its transportation system. While the importance of a well-functioning transport system for economic growth and poverty reduction is widely acknowledged, there is limited quantitative research demonstrating this relationship. Many studies have separately applied data envelopment analysis (DEA) to analyze highways, airports, railways, and harbors. However, they have yet to analyze all modes and their relationship with economic development comprehensively. Consequently, this paper seeks to address this gap in the existing literature. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that transportation system. To this end, we employ DEA and consider a range of operational variables, including airports, railways, highways, and harbors. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between transportation efficiency and several economic and social indicators, including gross domestic product (GDP), human development index (HDI), and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from the transportation system. Our findings reveal that Brazil exhibits the lowest relative efficiency when compared with the G-7 countries and South America. Additionally, it demonstrates medium efficiency within the BRICS group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).</description>

                Copper tube (CT) is an indispensable material for space cooling. However, under the urgent requirements of cooling-related emission reduction, the environmental impacts and effective emission reduction strategies associated with CT manufacturing have not been investigated. This study quantified the environmental impacts of China's CT manufacturing and further explored the emission reduction potentials. Key findings are (1) almost all of the considered types of the environmental impacts of CT manufacturing are from electricity use, with melting as the largest contributing process. The gate-to-gate carbon emission intensities of inner-grooved CT, coiled CT, and straight CT are 1018, 747, and 499 kg CO2 eq, respectively. (2) The cumulative carbon emissions of China's CT manufacturing from 2022 to 2050 will reach 47.5 Mt CO2 eq in baseline scenario, of which 50% from inner-grooved CT is due to its increasing use in air conditioners. (3) About 27 Mt CO2 of the cumulative carbon emissions of CT manufacturing can be reduced, with 60% contributed by sustainable energy strategies (incl., energy efficiency improvement, energy substitution, and electricity transition). Accordingly, the impacts of other environmental issues will also be decreased by 14%&#8211;66%. This study provides an important scientific basis for the green transition of the CT industry.</description>

      <title>Physical and Chemical Responses of Amidine-Containing Polymers in the Capture and Release of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;</title>

                Polymeric materials containing amidine motifs are of high interest due to their ability to reversibly capture and release CO2 at ambient temperature. Here we probe physical and chemical responses of styrene-based copolymers containing linear amidine motifs as functions of CO2 and inert gas exposures and temperature. A copper-catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition "click" reaction involving N&#8242;-propargyl-N,N-dimethylacetamidine is used to modify random copolymers, resulting in an array of linear amidine motifs along the chain backbone with the amount of CO2-active amidine controlled by the copolymer composition. Through thermogravimetric measurements, we demonstrate that the amidine-functionalized copolymers efficiently capture CO2 upon exposure to a stream of CO2 (at 27 &#176;C) and release it at a slightly elevated temperature (50 &#176;C) when exposed to an inert gas stream (N2). In addition to displaying a maximum adsorption capacity of 22 wt % in the presence of pure CO2, the copolymers show composition-dependent direct air capture (DAC) behaviors. Small molecule analogs are used to definitively understand degradation via chemical hydrolysis of the amidine moiety, which leads to insolubility and a large reduction in CO2 adsorption capacity (1.7 wt %). Neutron vibrational spectroscopy and DFT calculations confirm that CO2 binds strongly to the amidine motif, inducing a strong bending of the CO2 molecule from its linear geometry. The coupled insights into mechanisms and behaviors of CO2 adsorption in amidine-functionalized polymers provides a foundation for future investigations of CO2-responsive polymers and soft materials to improve carbon capture and sequestration technologies.</description>

      <title>MOFs-Derived Fe&#8211;Co Bimetallic Catalyst for Selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Hydrogenation to Light Olefins</title>

                The catalysis of CO2 to light olefins (C2=&#8211;C4=) utilizing Fe&#8211;Co bimetallic catalysts is deemed a practicable approach to counteract the excessive emission of CO2. However, a significant research gap exists in the study of manipulating the interaction between Fe&#8211;Co alloys, particularly in terms of component control. In this work, a range of bimetallic catalysts with varying Co/Fe molar ratios supported on ZrO2 were obtained through pyrolysis of mixed metal organic framework NH2-MIL-88B(Fe/Co)@UiO-66 that enables the hydrogenation of CO2 to C2=&#8211;C4=. Notably, the catalyst 10Fe1Co@ZrO2 exhibited a C2=&#8211;C4= selectivity of 45% at a CO2 conversion of 44.6%. The characterization results authenticate that, compared to the bare Fe catalyst, introducing Co significantly enhances the CO2 adsorption and conversion. Intriguingly, CoFe2O4 formed in both 10Fe1Co@ZrO2 and 5Fe1Co@ZrO2 undergoes reduction to generate CoxFey, facilitating its subsequent carbonization into the active phase &#967;-(CoxFe1&#8211;x)5C2 more readily during the reaction process.</description>

      <title>Optimization of CO2 Capture Using a New Aqueous Hybrid Solvent (MDEA-[TBPA][TFA]) with a Low Heat Capacity: Integration of COSMO-RS and RSM Approaches</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12122626</link>
      <description>Fairuz Liyana Mohd Rasdi, Revathi Jeyaseelan, Mohd Faisal Taha, Mohamad Amirul Ashraf Mohd Razip, Processes. 12(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404613417

                This study aims to evaluate the performance of a new hybrid solvent, comprising aqueous MDEA and tetrabutylphosphonium trifluoroacetate ([TBP][TFA]), for CO2 capture and to optimize its CO2 absorption efficiency. First, this study focused on predicting the thermodynamic properties of aqueous MDEAs and [TBP][TFA] and their interaction energy with CO2 using COSMO-RS. Based on the prediction, it aligns with the principle that CO2 solubility in the MDEA-[TBP][TFA] hybrid solvent decreases as the Henry&#8217;s Law constant increases, with the interactions primarily governed by van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding. The aqueous MDEA-[TBP][TFA] hybrid solvent was prepared in two steps: synthesizing and blending [TBP][TFA] with aqueous MDEAs. The formation and purity of [TBP][TFA] were confirmed through NMR, FT-IR, and Karl Fischer. The heat capacity of the hybrid solvents was lower than their aqueous MDEA solutions. The performance and optimization of CO2 capture were studied using RSM-FC-CCD design, with the optimal value obtained at 50 wt.% MDEA, 20 wt.% [TBP][TFA], 30 &#176;C, and 30 bar (12.14 mol/kg), aligning with COSMO-RS predictions. A 26% reduction in the heat capacity was achieved with the optimal ratio (wt.%) of the hybrid solvent. These findings suggest that the aqueous MDEA-[TBP][TFA] hybrid solvent is a promising alternative for CO2 capture, providing a high removal capacity and lower heat capacity for more efficient regeneration compared to commercial aqueous MDEA solutions.</description>

                With the advancement of distributed energy systems, energy sharing has emerged as a crucial trading mechanism on the demand-side, enabling participants to share self-generated energy with their neighbors through contractual agreements. Nevertheless, a comprehensive analysis is needed to balance the benefits among energy prosumers, given their distinct characteristics. This paper proposes a multi-energy sharing framework with flexible demand-side management based on full cooperation. We evaluate the economic and environmental performance of sharing participants, considering the impacts of different operation modes and diverse demand profiles. Cooperative game theory is employed to maximize the social welfare of all participants, with the different allocation schemes are used to distribute the cooperative surplus among stakeholders. The fairness of these schemes is assessed to ensure the feasibility and equity of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the centralized multi-energy sharing framework yields win-win outcomes for both individual and collective interests. Specifically, the total cost and carbon dioxide emissions of prosumers in the shared scenario are reduced by 13% and 16%, respectively, compared to individual operation scenarios. Moreover, thermal energy management is critically important for energy sharing. Furthermore, varying combinations of building types significantly affect cost savings and emission reductions, influencing energy sharing patterns and quantities.</description>

                The increased interest nowadays in quantitative assessment of soil respiration is largely due to studies of the role of various terrestrial ecosystems in changing the concentration of the most important greenhouse gas, CO2, in the atmosphere. The review considers methodological aspects of determining the actual CO2 emission from soils using chamber and absorption methods, as well as the use of the obtained data to assess the carbon balance in soils. Successful development of this topic will allow to promptly get an answer to the main question of this pressing environmental issue: what is the soil of this or that ecosystem for atmospheric CO2 &#8211; a net source or a net sink? The article analyzes the results of works devoted to comparative determination of CO2 emission from soils by these methods. It is shown that the widespread opinion about obtaining underreported data by absorption method is often based on studies in which the basic principles of the method were violated. It is concluded that it is necessary to carry out in-depth comparative studies on determination of average daily indicators of CO2 emission from soil by chamber and absorption methods. It is recognized that, regardless of the method, the main problem in using CO2 production data to estimate soil C balance is the adequate partitioning of total respiration into heterotrophic and autotrophic components, the ratio between which varies widely depending on soil and vegetation conditions. Due to imperfection and labor intensity of existing methods, this division can cause significant errors in determining the annual mineralization of soil organic matter. To reduce them, the approach to determination of mineralization losses of CO2 in bare fallow soils is considered. It is natural for soils of agrocenoses, but as a methodological technique can probably be used in natural grass ecosystems as well. Reduction of errors can be ensured due to the fact that differences in actual mineralization of organic matter in bare fallow and plant-occupied soils are several times less than changes in the ratio between heterotrophic and autotrophic components of soil respiration in different biogeocenoses.</description>

                Background/Objectives: This study focused on a group of 22 elite male mountain runners from Brazil (average age of 35.9 &#177; 6.5 years) with the objective of exploring the possible roles of the ACTN3 R577X, ACE I/D, and CK MM A/G NcoI genetic variants in shaping electrochemical profiles and maintaining acid-base homeostasis during a 105-km ultramarathon. Methods: Genotyping for each polymorphism (ACTN3: RR, RX, XX; ACE: DD, ID, II; CK MM: AA, AG, GG) was conducted using PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism), and saliva samples were used to obtain DNA. Analyses of electrochemical and acid-base disturbances were performed in real time. Results: It was observed that athletes who completed the race in less time had lower calcium concentrations (Rs = 0.35; p = 0.016). Athletes who completed the race faster had lower calcium concentrations (Rs = 0.35; p = 0.016). Pre-race, the RX genotype showed a 14.19% reduction in potassium levels compared to RR (p = 0.01). The GG genotype showed potassium levels 19.36% higher than AA (p = 0.01) and a 6.11% increase in hematocrit values compared to AA (p = 0.03). Additionally, the AG genotype exhibited hematocrit values 5.44% higher than AA (p = 0.03). Post-race, the XX genotype demonstrated higher hematocrit values compared to RX, with an increase of 8.92% (p = 0.03). The II genotype showed a 0.27% increase in pH compared to ID (p = 0.02) and a 20.42% reduction in carbon dioxide levels (p = 0.01). Conclusions: The findings emphasize the impact of the examined polymorphisms on the modulation of electrochemical factors and the maintenance of acid-base equilibrium in athletes during 105 km ultramarathons.</description>

      <title>Stability of two-phase flow with interfacial flux in porous media: CO2 mineralization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0237389</link>
      <description>Roi Roded, Laura E. Dalton, Physics of Fluids. 36(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404498431

                The primary objective of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) applications in various natural and engineered porous materials is to achieve a stable and planar CO2 displacement front, thereby suppressing viscous fingering. A stable front can ensure uniform and exhaustive CO2 mineralization throughout a reactive medium (i.e., mineral carbonation). Drawing inspiration from experimental observations of CO2 flooding into cores of portland cement-based materials, we examine the stability of such systems. Under these conditions, the injected CO2 continuously dissolves into the resident water phase, which becomes chemically disequilibrated with the solid minerals and leads to mineral carbonation on the wetted surfaces. Focusing on the early injection time allows us to reduce the complex multiphysical problem to a simple two-phase flow scenario of immiscible displacement with a CO2 interfacial flux sink. The formulated equations are investigated using numerical simulations and linear stability analysis, which results in a closed-form criterion, and provide fundamental insights into system stability. Overall, the results show that several effects combine to stabilize the system, including the sink effect, which acts to eliminate instability; the reduction in flow velocity along the flow path, which limits flow focusing; and the relative increase in stabilizing capillary forces. Therefore, if the system is stable at early stages, it will likely remain stable later on. Finally, this research demonstrates the use of theory to simplify complex problems and shows that even when flow is inherently coupled, the state of systems can often be determined from fluid stability alone.</description>

      <title>A Noise-Oriented and Redundancy-Aware Instance Selection Framework</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1145/3705000</link>
      <description>Washington Cunha, Alejandro Moreo, Andrea Esuli, Fabrizio Sebastiani, Leonardo Rocha, Marcos Andr&#233; Gon&#231;alves, ACM transactions on office information systems. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404534353

                Fine-tuning transformer-based deep learning models is currently at the forefront of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tasks. However, fine-tuning these transformers for specific tasks, especially when dealing with ever-expanding volumes of data, constant retraining requirements, and budget constraints, can be computationally and financially costly, requiring substantial energy consumption and contributing to carbon dioxide emissions. This article focuses on advancing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) on instance selection (IS) &#8211; a range of document filtering techniques designed to select the most representative documents for the sake of training. The objective is to either maintain or enhance classification effectiveness while reducing the overall training (fine-tuning) total processing time. In our prior research, we introduced the E2SC framework, a redundancy-oriented IS method focused on transformers and large datasets &#8211; currently the state-of-the-art in IS. Nonetheless, important research questions remained unanswered in our previous work, mostly due to E2SC's sole emphasis on redundancy. In this article, we take our research a step further by proposing biO-IS &#8211; an extended bi - ob jective i nstance s election solution, a novel IS framework aimed at simultaneously removing redundant and noisy instances from the training. biO-IS estimates redundancy based on scalable, fast, and calibrated weak classifiers and captures noise with the support of a new entropy-based step. We also propose a novel iterative process to estimate near-optimum reduction rates for both steps. Our extended solution is able to reduce the training sets by 41% on average (up to 60%) while maintaining the effectiveness in all tested datasets, with speedup gains of 1.67 on average (up to 2.46x). No other baseline, not even our previous SOTA solution, was capable of achieving results with this level of quality, considering the tradeoff among training reduction, effectiveness, and speedup.

      <title>Preparation and characterization of reactive extrusion modified PLA/ABS blends and its foams</title>

      <description>M. Moghadam, No host. None(None)] 2021. https://openalex.org/W4404604294

                The current thesis takes place within the context of the projects MAT2016-80045-R "Aplicaciones industriales de compuestos y mezclas basados en REX-PLA" and the project "PLAIABS Blends: Recydability and weight reduction" financially supported by the Ministerio de Econom&#237;a y Competitividad of the Spanis h Government and SEAT res pectively. The main objective was to improve the properties of poly lactic acid (PLA) in arder to make it suitable for long-lasting applications where emphasis is de\Qted to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and the renewable raw materiaIs content. Among the different routes to enhance PLA properties, blending was used, as it is easily scalable bythe industry. Dueto its good balance of properties, ABS was considered a suitable polymer to be used together with PLA However, dueto their immiscibili ty, a coupling agent (ABS-g -MAH) was introduced. Apart of brittl ness, another PLA problem is its relatively easy degradation during process ing. Previous studies of the Group indicated that PLAdegradation could be limited using a multi epoxide reactive agent that a110ids the loss in molecular weight and increases the PLA melt visc osity, which, on the other hand, facilitates processing . Moreover, it was believed that the unreacted chain extender epoxide groups could also form covalent bonding with the coupling agent improving ABS and PLA compatibility. Using foams both the total weight and carbon dioxide generation of components can be diminished. For these reasons, different techniques for physicallyfoaming the blends either during injection (MuCell) or through a batch process were object of research. The effect of the above mentioned chain extender and the effect of a tale filler on the batch-foaming behavior of PLAwas studied. The first step of the research consisted in obtained the base materiaIs by reactive extrusion (REX) at a pilot plant seale (50 kg.). A conventional injection molding process was then employed to obtain standard samples that were used for the thermo&#173; mechanical characterization ofthe blends. The thermal stabilitywas studied bythe Kissinger 's method. The results showed that it was improved when the amount of ABS-g-MAH was increased. From the DSC analysis, it was found that in comparison to more perfect REX-PLA structures, crystals with a smaller lamellar thickness were formed in the blends. The differences in crystallinitywere small and do not influence the mechanical properties. The presence of ABS in the compositions led to a decrease ofthe blend 's storage modulus. Nonetheless, the ABS phase was found to playthe role of scaffold for the PLA phase that can undergo re&#173; crystallization, being thus able to support a certain amount of loading during heating. The physical foaming ofthe different injected blends was difficult to be achieved. The optimization ofthe foaming conditions required several triaIs and a large quantityof material. As the amount of each blend was limited, only a partial number of the proposed experiments were possible. The obtained blends contained a few large cells as well as a certain population of small sized cells. Although a complete micro-cellular structure was not achieved, the obtained one was similar to that of previous works found in literature. lt was, however, demonstrated that this technique can be used byindustryto generate lighter components. Batch foaming using CO2 in supercritical conditions resulted in successful foams with cell sizes below 100 microns and very high cell densi ties. In comparison to PLA, dueto its higher viscosity and melt resistance, using REX-PLA resulted in improved level offoaming which prevents from cell coalescence and collapse. The presence of ABS in the blends allowed broadening the range of pressure and temperatures in which foams can be produced. Tale was found to actas a nucleating agent leading to smaller cell sizes and higher cell densities in the foamed blends. La presente tesis se enmarca en los proyectos MAT2016-80045-R "Aplicac iones industriales de compuestos y basados en REX-PLA'' y "PLA / ABS Blends: Reciclabilidad y reducci&#243;n de peso" que han sido subvencionados por el Ministerio de Econom&#237;a y Competitividad del Gobierno de Espa&#241;a y SEAT respectivamente. El objetivo principal que se persigue es mejorar las propiedades del &#225;cido polil&#225;ctico (PLA) de forma que pueda emplearse en aplicaciones de larga duraci&#243;n, donde la reducci&#243;n de las emisiones de di&#243;xido de carbono y el contenido de materias primas renovables toma mayor importancia con respecto a la biodegradabilidad . Entre las diferentes rutas para mejorar las propiedades del PLA se seleccionado el mezclado ya que es facilmente reproducible por la industria. Debido a su buen equilibrio de propiedades, el ABS se consider&#243; una opci&#243;n adecuada para ser utilizado junto con PLA si bien fue necesario introducir un compatibilizante . Aparte de la fragilidad , el PLA puede degradar durante su procesado . En estudios previos del Grupo de investigaci&#243;n se ha visto que dicha degradaci&#243;n puede limitarse utilizando un agente reactivo multiep&#243;xido que limita la p&#233;rdida de peso molecular y aumenta la viscosidad del PLA. Adem&#225;s, los grupos ep&#243;xido remanentes se cree que pueden ser capaces de reaccionar con el agente de acoplamiento mejorando as&#237; la compatibilidad. La espumaci&#243;n es un m&#233;todo que permite disminuir tanto el peso como la huella de carbono de un cierto componentes. Por estas razones , se estudiaron diferentes t&#233;cnicas para espumar f&#237;sicamente las mezclas , bien durante la inyecci&#243;n (MuCell) o bien usando un proceso discontinuo . En este sentido se estudi&#243; el efecto del extensor de cadena mencionado as&#237; como el efecto del talco durante la espumaci&#243;n discontinua. El primer paso de la investigaci&#243;n consisti&#243; en obtener los materiales base, por extrusi&#243;n reactiva (REX) a nivel de planta piloto (50 kg.) . Posteriormente se emple&#243; la inyecci&#243;n convencional para obtener muestras para la caracterizaci&#243;n termomec&#225;nica de las mezclas. La estabilidad t&#233;rmica se estudi&#243; mediante el m&#233;todo de Kissinger. Los resultados mostraron el incremento de ABS-g-MAH contribuye a una may0r estabilidad. A trav&#233;s de DSC, se vi&#243; que en las mezclas se formaron cristales con un espesor !amelar m&#225;s peque&#241;o en comparaci&#243;n con el REX-PLA Las diferencias en cristalinidad fueron peque&#241;as y no influyeron en las propiedades mec&#225;nicas. La presencia de ABS en las mezclas condujo a una disminuci&#243;n del m&#243;dulo de almacenamiento. No obstante, se encontr&#243; que la fase ABS juega el papel de andamio para la fase PLAque puede sufrir recristalizaci&#243;n durante el calentamiento, pudiendo as&#237; soportar una cierta cantidad de esfuerzo. La espumaci&#243;n f&#237;sica de las diferentes mezclas inyectadas fue dif&#237;cil de conseguir. La optimizaci&#243;n de las condiciones requiri&#243; divserdas pruebas yel empleo de una gran cantidad de material. Como la cantidad de cada mezcla era limitada, solo fue posible realizar una parte de los experimentos propuestos . No obstante lo anterior, las piezas inyectadas y espumadas conten&#237;an algunas celdas grandes , as&#237; como una cierta poblaci&#243;n de c&#233;lulas de peque&#241;o tama&#241;o. Aunque no se logr&#243; una estructura microcelular completa, la obtenida fue similar a la de trabajos previos encontrados en la literatura. Sin embargo, se ha demostrado que esta t&#233;cnica puede ser utilizada para generar componentes aligerados . La formaci&#243;n de espuma en batch usando CO2 dio como resultado espumas con tama&#241;os de celda por debajo de 100 micras y densidades de celda muy altas. En comparaci&#243;n con el PLA, el REX-PLA result&#243; en un may0r nivel de es pum aci&#243;n debido a su mayor viscosidad y resistencia en fundido, lo que evit&#243; la coalescencia y el colapso celular. La presencia de ABS en las mezclas permiti&#243; asimismo ampliar el rango de presiones y temperaturas en las que se pueden producir las espumas. Se descubri&#243; que Tale act&#250;a como un agente nucleante que conduce a tama&#241;os celulares m&#225;s peque&#241;os y densidades celulares m&#225;s altas en las mezclas espumadas.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Effect of Copper and Indium Species for Highly Selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c08258</link>
      <description>Shangzhi Xie, Xintian Luo, Jialong Zhao, Minjie Xu, Haoxiang Chen, Minghui Zhu, Jing Xu, ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp; Engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404625683

                CO2 hydrogenation to methanol over Cu-based catalysts faces challenges such as low methanol selectivity and poor stability. Here, we report a series of CuIn bimetallic catalysts with different Cu/In ratios prepared by the coprecipitation method. Among them, the methanol selectivity of Cu25In75 reaches as high as 92.5% at 200 &#176;C and 64.5% at 260 &#176;C, which is 1.3 times and 1.9 times higher than that of the commercial catalyst at 200 and 260 &#176;C, respectively. Moreover, Cu25In75 exhibits high stability for 200 h time-on-stream at 260 &#176;C. The high selectivity originates from a strong interaction between Cu species and In2O3&#8211;x with oxygen vacancies. On the interface between Cu and In2O3&#8211;x, dispersed Cu is the main contributor to the activation and dissociation of H2, while the oxygen vacancies in In2O3 adsorb and activate CO2. During the reaction, the abundance of hydrogen facilitates the reduction of the In2O3 surface, promoting the generation of surface oxygen vacancies and providing the necessary hydrogen for the hydrogenation reaction. Our research unveils a promising synergistic strategy for the rational design and application of Cu-based catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation, offering avenues for further exploration and advancement in this field.</description>

      <title>Effects of High Pressure and Ultrasonication Pretreatments and Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Extraction on Physico&#8208;Chemical Properties of Edible Insect Oils</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/jfpe.14781</link>
      <description>Nantawan Boonmee, Sasivimon Chittrakorn, Sukeewan Detyothin, Worasit Tochampa, Chayaphon Sriphannam, Khanitta Ruttarattanamongkol, Journal of Food Process Engineering. 47(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404555033

                ABSTRACT Edible insects have gained increased attention as the important and sustainable source of nutrients for both human and animal consumption due to their rich content of protein, oil, fiber (as chitin), vitamins, and minerals. This study focuses on examining the effects of advanced pretreatments and oil extraction methods from prominent edible insect species commercially cultivated in Thailand, namely the house cricket ( Acheta domesticus ), black soldier fly larvae ( Hermetia illucens ), and silkworm ( Bombxy mori ). The raw insect samples underwent pretreatment using high pressure processing (HPP) at 200&#8211;600 MPa for 5 min or ultrasonication (UL) at 37 kHz for 5&#8211;15 min, followed by dehydration and extraction using supercritical carbon dioxide (SC&#8208;CO 2 ) or solvent extraction. The study revealed that HPP significantly reduced the initial microbial load of all edible insects by 6&#8211;8 log cycles, while UL showed a slight effect on microbial reduction. Additionally, pretreatments notably improved the oil extraction yield of most samples by disrupting the integrity of the cell membrane, facilitating the release of oils. The extracted edible insect oils were rich in unsaturated fatty acids, omega 3, 6, and 9, making them suitable for various applications such as cosmetics, food, and feed additives. Furthermore, the protein meals obtained as a residue after oil removal were identified as potential meat alternatives or replacements in food or feed formulations. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of edible insects as a sustainable source of oil and protein, highlighting the significance of pretreatments and extraction methods in maximizing their utility for various applications in the food, cosmetic, and feed industries.</description>

      <title>Development and Validation of a Novel Gas-Washing Bottle Incubation System (GBIS) for Monitoring Microbial Growth in Liquid Media Under Well-Controlled Modified Atmosphere Conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/foods13233723</link>
      <description>Seren O&#287;uz, Eleonora Bonanni, Lotta Kuuliala, Mariem Somrani, Frank Devlieghere, Foods. 13(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404584315

                The transition towards more sustainable packaging calls for improving our ability to predict, control, and inhibit microbial growth. Despite the importance of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) in food preservation, the exact relations between MAP gases (CO2, O2, N2) and microbial behavior are still poorly understood. Addressing this major knowledge gap requires a specific infrastructure to gain precise control over the gas composition during storage time. Thus, this study aimed at developing and validating an innovative gas-washing bottle incubation system (GBIS) with an adapted pH methodology for monitoring microbial growth in liquid media under different well-controlled conditions. Listeria monocytogenes&#8212;a psychrotrophic pathogen raising severe safety concerns under refrigerated conditions&#8212;was used as a representative microorganism. The results showed that daily gas flushing effectively dominated overnight headspace variations, allowing incubating L. monocytogenes and daily sampling for 13 days under static conditions. Subsequently, storage experiments were performed at 4 &#176;C under stable pH and anaerobic conditions with different CO2 levels (20&#8211;40&#8211;60%). Significant growth reduction was observed from 6.0 to 4.8 log CFU/mL as CO2 increased from 20% (pH = 6.7) to 60% (pH = 6.2) (p &#8804; 0.05). Overall, GBIS shows great potential in data collection for predictive modeling and, consecutively, for boosting decision-making in the food packaging sector.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impacts of Lifestyle Changes in the Global Energy Transition: Insights from a Model-Based Analysis Using PROMETHEUS</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/cli12120193</link>
      <description>Panagiotis Fragkos, Eleftheria Zisarou, Andreas Andreou, Climate. 12(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404595399

                A global clean energy transition is required for achieving ambitious climate goals and ensuring sustainable development. While technological advancements are crucial, they are not sufficient on their own to meet Paris Agreement (PA) climate targets. Integrating lifestyle changes, particularly in sectors such as transport and residential use of energy, into climate policies and energy modeling framework is gaining recognition in energy transition research. This study explores the impact of lifestyle changes on the global energy system and CO2 emissions using the PROMETHEUS model, an advanced energy&#8211;economy&#8211;environment system model. In this research we present scenarios in which lifestyle changes, such as reduced private car use and increased adoption of public transport and energy-savings behavior in households, are gradually introduced and complement technological and policy measures within the energy transition framework. We explore the impacts of scenarios with different levels of climate policies and lifestyle changes to evaluate the effects of various behavioral shifts on global energy consumption and CO2 emissions. Results show that even under current climate policies, lifestyle changes can reduce global energy demand by 5% by 2030 and 10% by 2050. When combined with ambitious decarbonization policies, the reductions are much more significant, leading to a 35% reduction by 2050 compared to the baseline scenario. Overall, the findings suggest that lifestyle changes, when effectively integrated with climate policy measures, can reduce energy demand and carbon emissions, alleviate the pressure on energy supply, and reduce the cost burden for energy producers and consumers.</description>

                The intensification of human activities is the chief cause of increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere, accelerating climate change. This results in rising air and ocean temperatures and leads to prolonged droughts, devastating floods, and storms, which pose global risks with local implications. International institutions are urging countries to reduce GHG emissions through various agreements, like the Paris Agreement which Serbia has ratified, committing to a 13.2% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030. Similarly, Belgrade, under the Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40% in specific sectors by 2030. Spatial and urban planning should address questions regarding which activities, where and when to implement to achieve this. In this context, the Elaborate for early public insight of the Master Plan of Belgrade 2041 was analysed through document analysis and comparison methods, to determine whether and how climate mitigation was addressed. The project Climate Action for Belgrade, completed at the Faculty of Geography in Belgrade during the fall semester of 2023/2024, served as a reference point. It was one of the local projects within the Global Climate Geodesign Challenge, which is being implemented since 2022 by International Geodesign Collaboration and Liechtenstein Institute for Strategic Development (LISD) with the companies Esri and Geodesign Hub. All local projects follow the predefined geodesign methodological framework and digital technology, as well as LISD's domains and climate actions directory. The comparative analysis of the Elaborate and the project revealed that many planning measures in the Elaborate, although initially addressing other issues, could also contribute to climate mitigation. However, the potential to contribute to this goal has not been fully utilized in many areas, leaving opportunities for further enhancement through innovative and proactive approaches, not only in climate mitigation but also sustainable urban development context.</description>

      <title>Review: Effect of Material Characteristics, and Process Conditions in Reducing Gaseous Pollutants Using Fly Ash (FA)-Based Adsorbent</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.31938/jsn.v14i4.749</link>
      <description>Budi Setya Wardhana, Farrah Fadhillah Hanum, Zahrul Mufrodi, Siti Jamilatun, Jurnal Sains Natural. 14(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404531023

                The intensive use of fossil fuels has led to a significant increase in air pollution, which negatively affects human health and the environment. Fly ash (FA), a byproduct of coal combustion, has great potential as an adsorbent for hazardous gas pollutants due to its physical and chemical properties. This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of fly ash as an adsorbent in reducing gas pollutants such as CO2, SO2, and NO2, as well as to examine the influence of temperature and material characteristics on adsorption capacity. The results indicate that the maximum adsorption capacity for each gas pollutant is achieved at different temperatures, fly ash demonstrating the highest performance at 150 &#176;C for CO2 adsorption, achieving an efficiency of 94.7%. For SO2 and NO2, the optimum temperatures are 200 &#176;C, with efficiencies of 72.17% and 100%, respectively. This study also emphasizes the importance of selecting the appropriate characteristics of the adsorbent material to enhance adsorption efficiency. This finding has the potential to support the development of more efficient and sustainable air pollution reduction technologies in the future, by utilizing industrial waste such as fly ash as an innovative solution.</description>

      <title>Clean Energy and Carbon Emissions in Mexico&#8217;s Electric Power Sector: Past Performance and Current Trend</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17235859</link>
      <description>Oliver Probst, Energies. 17(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404640673

                The concept of clean energy was introduced by the Mexican authorities as part of the wholesale electricity market with the objectives of both measuring the progress in decarbonization and fostering emission-free and low-emission technologies. In the present work, the evolution of clean energy production for the period 2017&#8211;2023, corresponding to seven full years of operation of the electricity market, was analyzed and compared to official targets. Emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) was calculated from fuel consumption statistics. The consistency between electricity generation and fuel consumption data has been assessed. The projected short-term evolution of electricity generation and GHG emissions through 2026, locked in by decisions in the recent past, was modeled and discussed. A reduction in carbon intensity from 0.56 gCO2,eq to 0.46 g CO2,eq was found for the 2017&#8211;2022 period, in qualitative agreement with official figures, mainly due to the large-scale introduction of wind and solar, as well as some displacement of coal- and fuel oil-fired generation. Total GHG emissions reached a minimum of about 150 Gt CO2,eq/a in 2020&#8211;2021; emissions are projected to rise to 190 Gt CO2,eq in 2026, due to a strong rise in natural gas-fired generation from combined-cycle plants and the largely stalled development of wind and solar plants. Clean energy figures were found to decouple from emissions and can therefore not be considered a good proxy for decarbonization. A recent roadmap presented by the incoming federal government does, however, indicate a change in policies which might bring Mexico back on track towards the decarbonization of the electric power sector.</description>

                Cement kilns offer an attractive method of utilizing certain wastes as substitutes for fossil fuel, thus providing an alternative to landfilling and incineration. The use of waste-derived fuel (WDF) in cement kilns not only provides a safe and cost-effective disposal method for combustible wastes, it also provides a net reduction in CO2 emissions since the WDF is replacing fossil fuel rather than being incinerated. This paper considers the fate of both metals and hydrocarbons present in WDF, and uses a simple process model to evaluate the thermal impact of injecting solid WDF into the calcining zone.</description>

                This article is dedicated to the issues of formulating a &#8220;green&#8221; investment policy. The research aims to analyze, systematize, and improve the existing theoretical and methodological framework concerning the development of the &#8220;green&#8221; economy in Ukraine and develop a mechanism for formulating a &#8220;green&#8221; investment policy. The development of the &#8220;green&#8221; economy in Ukraine and its significance for achieving sustainable economic development are examined. A comprehensive analysis of the main aspects influencing the country&#8217;s ecological economic formation is presented, including carbon dioxide emissions, transformational mechanisms for the transition, and the state of ecological innovation implementation. It is substantiated that developing the &#8220;green&#8221; economy is crucial in the transition to sustainable economic development, which considers ecological, social, and economic aspects. The results of expert evaluations are provided, indicating some progress in developing the &#8220;green&#8221; economy from 2021 to 2023 despite the country&#8217;s military conflict&#8217;s negative consequences. It is found that one of the critical tools for stimulating the development of the &#8220;green&#8221; economy is environmental taxes, which contribute to pollution reduction and foster corporate responsibility. The research also revealed that while the environmental tax in Ukraine has potential, it still occupies a minor share of the tax revenue structure, indicating the need to improve its implementation mechanisms. The study identified that the market for &#8220;green&#8221; investments is actively developing; however, obstacles exist, such as the lack of clear standards and criteria for defining &#8220;green&#8221; projects and a high level of risk associated with investing in advanced ecological technologies. A mechanism for formulating a &#8220;green&#8221; investment policy is proposed. It is determined that implementing the &#8220;green&#8221; investment policy in Ukraine requires a systematic approach and coordinated efforts from many stakeholders in the process, including government bodies, private companies, and non-governmental organizations. Developing an investment policy that stimulates investments in environmentally friendly technologies is also essential. It is noted that to achieve the goals of developing a &#8220;green&#8221; economy in Ukraine, it is necessary to overcome existing barriers and ensure stability and transparency in the investment environment.

      <title>Open Tool for Automated Development of Renewable Energy Communities: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Techniques for Methodological Approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17225726</link>

                The architecture, engineering, construction, and operations (AECO) sector exerts a considerable influence on energy consumption and CO2 emissions released into the atmosphere, making a notable contribution to climate change. It is therefore imperative that energy efficiency in buildings is prioritized in order to reduce environmental impacts and meet the targets set out in the European 2030 Agenda. In this context, renewable energy communities (RECs) have the potential to play an important role, promoting the use of renewable energy at the local level, optimizing energy management, and reducing consumption by sharing resources and advanced technologies. This paper introduces an open tool (OT) designed for the configuration of energy systems dedicated to RECs. The OT considers several inputs, including thermal and electrical loads, energy consumption, the type of building, surface area, and population size. The OT employs artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and machine learning (ML) techniques to generate forecast optimized scenarios for the sizing of photovoltaic systems, thermal, and electrical storage, and the estimation of CO2 emission reductions. The OT features a user-friendly interface, enabling even non-experts to obtain comprehensive configurations for RECs, aiming to accelerate the transition toward sustainable and efficient district energy systems, driving positive environmental impact and fostering a greener future for communities and cities.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Epitaxial Cobalt-Doped GaN Nanowires on Carbon Paper for Stable Lithium-Ion Storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29225428</link>
      <description>Peng Wu, Xiaoguang Wang, Danchen Wang, Yifan Wang, Qiuju Zheng, Tailin Wang, Changlong Sun, Dan Li&#365;, Fuzhou Chen, Sake Wang, Molecules. 29(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404497266

                Due to its distinctive structure and unique physicochemical properties, gallium nitride (GaN) has been considered a prospective candidate for lithium storage materials. However, its inferior conductivity and unsatisfactory cycle performance hinder the further application of GaN as a next-generation anode material for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). To address this, cobalt (Co)-doped GaN (Co-GaN) nanowires have been designed and synthesized by utilizing the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) strategy. The structural characterizations indicate that the doped Co elements in the GaN nanowires exist as Co2+ rather than metallic Co. The Co2+ prominently promotes electrical conductivity and ion transfer efficiency in GaN. The cycling capacity of Co-GaN reached up to 495.1 mA h g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles. After 500 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1, excellent cycling capacity remained at 276.6 mA h g&#8722;1. The intimate contact between Co-GaN nanowires and carbon paper enhances the conductivity of the composite. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further illustrated that Co substitution changed the electron configuration in the GaN, which led to enhancement of the electron transfer efficiency and a reduction in the ion diffusion barrier on the Co-GaN electrode. This doping design boosts the lithium-ion storage performance of GaN as an advanced material in lithium-ion battery anodes and in other electrochemical applications.</description>

      <title>Environmental Assessment of Calcium Sulfoaluminate Cement: A Monte Carlo Simulation in an Industrial Symbiosis Framework</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14113673</link>
      <description>Meltem Tanguler-Bayramtan, Can B. Akta&#351;, &#304;sm&#551;il &#214;zg&#252;r Yaman, Buildings. 14(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404503024

                Calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement is recognized as an environmentally friendly alternative to Portland cement (PC) due to its lower carbon footprint and energy requirements. However, traditional CSA cement production faces significant obstacles, including the high cost and regionally constrained availability of bauxite, a key raw material. Utilizing alternative materials in the production process offers a viable approach to address these limitations. This study evaluated the environmental performance of three laboratory-synthesized CSA cements using alternative raw materials sourced through an industrial symbiosis framework. A comparative assessment with PC was conducted, focusing on energy consumption and CO2 emissions as key environmental performance indicators. The environmental impact of the CSA cements was analyzed using Monte Carlo simulations, a robust statistical approach based on data for the constituent raw materials. This method provides a practical alternative to a full life cycle assessment (LCA) when comprehensive data are not available. The results demonstrate that the CSA cements have significantly lower environmental impacts compared to PC, achieving energy savings of 13&#8211;16% and CO2 emission reductions of 35&#8211;48%. These results emphasize the potential of industrial symbiosis to enable more sustainable CSA cement production while addressing raw material constraints. In addition, this approach highlights the wider applicability of industrial symbiosis frameworks in the construction industry, contributing to a zero-waste future and supporting global climate goals.</description>

      <title>A new global carbon flux estimation methodology by assimilation of both in situ and satellite CO2 observations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41612-024-00824-w</link>
      <description>Wu Su, Binghao Wang, Han Y. H. Chen, Lin Zhu, Xiaogu Zheng, Song Xi Chen, npj Climate and Atmospheric Science. 7(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404609045

                Accurate estimation of carbon removal by terrestrial ecosystems and oceans is crucial to the success of global carbon mitigation initiatives. The emergence of multi-source CO2 observations offers prospects for an improved assessment of carbon fluxes. However, the utility of these diverse observations has been limited by their heterogeneity, leading to much variation in estimated carbon fluxes. To harvest the diverse data types, this paper develops a multi-observation carbon assimilation system (MCAS), which simultaneously integrates both satellite and ground-based observations. MCAS modifies the ensemble Kalman filter to apply different inflation factors to different types of observation errors, addressing the heterogeneity between satellite and in situ data. In commonly used independent validation datasets, the carbon flux derived from MCAS outperformed those obtained from a single source, demonstrating a 20% reduction in error compared to existing carbon flux products. We use MCAS to conduct ecosystem and ocean carbon flux inversion for the period of 2016&#8211;2020, which reveals that the 5-year average global net terrestrial and ocean sink was 1.84 &#177; 0.60 and 2.74 &#177; 0.49 petagrams, absorbing approximately 47% of human-caused CO2 emissions together, which were consistent with the global carbon project estimates of 1.82 and 2.66 petagrams. All these facts suggest MCAS is a better methodology than those for assimilating single-source observation only.</description>

      <title>Vitrified Clay for the Production of a Green Sustainable Ultra-High-Performance Fiber-Reinforced Concrete</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17225624</link>
      <description>Ana Luisa Mu&#241;oz-Espinoza, Lucio Guillermo L&#243;pez-Y&#233;pez, Jos&#233; Abelardo Valdez-Aguilar, C&#233;sar Ju&#225;rez, A. Dur&#225;n-Herrera, Materials. 17(22)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404528947

                As awareness of the impact of anthropogenic activities on climate change increases, the concepts of durability, resilience, and sustainability in concrete tend to be adopted more seriously in the concrete construction industry. In this sense, one of the concrete technologies that began in the 1980s and that significantly contributes to maximize the beneficial effect on all these concepts are the ultra-high-performance concretes, a very attractive technology because it presents ultra-high strength and durability performances far superior to those of conventional concretes, a performance that is leading to a permanent increased demand. However, the development of these concretes has been widely criticized due to their high ecological impact, which is mainly attributable to the high cement dosages required for their production (800&#8211;1000 kg/m3). To address this criticism in a comprehensive manner and thereby reduce the embodied carbon attributable exclusively to the material, this research was oriented to determine the effect of an industrial by-product of vitrified clay, as a partial or total substitution for cement, silica fume, and limestone aggregate, on the compressive strength, flexural toughness, and embodied CO2. For the UHPC&#8217;s evaluated in this work with a dosage of 2% by volume of steel micro-fibers, the results evidence the feasibility that the following substitutions by mass: 30% of the Portland cement, 100% of the silica fume, and 30% of the limestone aggregate and powder, do not detract the fresh stage, the compressive strength, the static modulus of elasticity, and the flexural strength, leading to significant reductions of the embodied CO2.</description>

                Telework has become a commonly employed modality in companies and public institutions to perform work activities, mainly due to the confinement caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, even before the pandemic, telework was recommended to mitigate some of the adverse effects of human activity on the environment, reduce the use of resources in companies, combat traffic congestion, and affect the quality of life of workers. The present article is exploratory and aims to analyze the workers' perspective on telework and its relation to the environment. We proceeded to apply a survey, using a poll, to more than 200 people;subsequently, a descriptive statistics analysis was carried out in order to identify patterns or classifications among different groups of workers. Teleworking offers several perceived advantages, one of which is the significant reduction in commuting and fuel consumption. A staggering 90.91% of teleworkers acknowledge this reduction in CO2 emissions. Furthermore, this work modality enables companies to curb their electricity consumption and use of air conditioning, thereby benefiting the environment. From an environmental standpoint, telework can contribute to sustainable development by reducing emissions and energy consumption. This positive impact aligns with the country's decarbonization goals and can also enhance people's quality of life.</description>

      <title>Climate Risks and Economic Consequences of Rising Global CO2 Emissions in Aviation, Shipping, and Heavy-Duty Transport</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.17737/tre.2025.11.1.00188</link>
      <description>Eyime Eyime, Ogri Ushie, Trends in Renewable Energy. 11(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404530762

                This study examines methods to lessen the environmental consequences of global CO2 emissions from the hard-to-abate transport sector. The paper analyzed historical and projected trends in global CO2 emissions from the hard-to-abate transport industry under two scenarios: the stated policy scenario (STEPS) and the announced pledged scenario (APS). The study covered the historical period from 2010 to 2022 and projected emissions up to 2050. The analysis revealed that the compound annual growth rate (CAAGR) of STEP exceeded that of APS in 2030 and 2050 for challenging emissions from heavy- duty vehicles, aircraft, and shipping when compared to the baseline year of 2022. The aviation industry has a higher CAAGR of 5.3% and 2.5% for 2030 and 2050, respectively, compared to heavy-duty vehicles at 1.6% and 0.9% for 2030 and 2050, respectively, and shipping at 0.7% and 0.9% for 2030 and 2050, respectively, under STEPS. Under the APS scenario, shipping showed a negative CAAGR of -0.8% and -2.8% for 2030 and 2050, respectively, and 0.4% and -1.8% for 2030 and 2050, respectively, for heavy-duty trucks. In comparison, the aviation industry had CAAGRs of 4.5% and 0.8% for 2030 and 2050, respectively. The data shows that the aviation industry is expected to see a far greater CAAGR in emissions than heavy-duty vehicles and shipping in both STEPS and APS scenarios. Targeted efforts are necessary to mitigate the environmental effects of air travel in the upcoming decades. The paper also examined 56 publicly traded international transportation companies and their corresponding carbon emission targets. Only seven companies, or 12.5%, have established goals for reducing emissions from 2023 to 2050; 10 companies, accounting for 17.9%, have committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2040 to 2060; five corporations, representing 8.9%, have set targets for reducing emission intensity from 2025 to 2034; and 34 global corporations, making up 60.7%, have committed to achieving net zero emissions between 2040 and 2050. Despite some progress in setting emission reduction targets in the air travel industry, many companies still need to set carbon footprint reduction goals.</description>

      <title>Field investigation on the performance of low-carbon MgO-carbonated composite piles for ground treatments</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1139/cgj-2024-0361</link>
      <description>Yizhao Liu, Songyu Liu, Hongjiang Li, Guangyin Du, Chaozhe Zhang, Jiawei Sun, Canadian Geotechnical Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404557920

                Carbonation technology using MgO and CO2 has been considered a rapid, effective, and environmentally friendly method for improving weak soils, mainly applied in shallow foundation treatments. This study introduced a novel MgO-carbonated composite pile (MCP) technique developed by injecting CO2 through a gas-permeable pipe pile into a MgO-mixing column for carbonation and solidification and its applications in weak subgrade treatments. Several field tests were carried out to study the characteristics of MCP as well as the performance of the MCP-reinforced foundations, including carbonation reaction temperature monitoring, pore-water pressure monitoring, standard penetration tests (SPT), unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests, static load tests, and subgrade deformation monitoring. Results showed vigorous and uniform carbonation within the MgO-mixing column, confirming the feasibility of constructing large-diameter MgO-mixing columns. The distribution, evolution, and affected zone of excess pore-water pressure induced by MCP installation were determined. The MCP exhibited good pile quality, with average SPT-N and UCS values of 39 and 1021 kPa, respectively. MCP&#8217;s bearing capacity was superior to pre-stressed high-strength concrete pipe piles, with ultimate vertical and lateral bearing capacities of 1920 kN and 119 kN, respectively. The MCP-reinforced foundation exhibited a small settlement of 54.5 mm under embankment loads. Life cycle assessment indicated significant carbon reduction benefits for MCP, with 44.7% lower carbon emissions compared to traditional composite piles.</description>

      <title>Viability of flax particles to develop cellular construction materials: Physico-mechanical characterisation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.34118/jbms.v9i2.2782</link>
      <description>Mohamed Hamadou-Ali, Amar Benazzouk, Ha&#239;kel Ben Hamed, Journal of Building Materials and Structures. 9(2)] 2022. https://openalex.org/W4404556893

                The problems related to environmental issues have motivated extensive research on environmentally friendly materials. The built environment is responsible for high primary energy use and more of energy related CO2 emissions. However, it is important to develop low-embodied energy, carbon-negative, sustainable construction materials to replace conventional products. In this context, agricultural wastes are the excellent alternative materials to substitute mineral aggregates because they are widespread and easily accessible. The application of these elements is interesting as regards the recycling of the vegetable particles, since these are easily available and renewable low-cost raw materials, and has advantage for economy and environment. However, the reduction of energy consumption in construction, production of thermal insulation materials, and the solution of environmental problems by recycling waste are becoming greater problems. Various types of agriculture waste, after being processed, have been used as particles in concrete or mortars. These materials display lower density and have several potential applications such as acoustic and thermal insulation, fire resistance cladding&#8230;etc. The study reported in this paper was undertaken to investigate the physico-mechanical properties of cellular materials based on flax particles, in order to produce usable materials in cellular concrete applications. The material produced containing different volumes of flax particles (0V (control mortar), 1V, and 2V) was lightened by creating a porous structure in the matrix through a chemical reaction between aluminium powder and free lime. A study conducted on hardened material properties has indicated a significant reduction in sample unit weight, thereby resulting in a level of compressive strength compatible with a load-bearing wall. The reduction in flexural strength was lower than that in compressive strength. These results shown that the cellular material based on flax particles can be used as suitable insulated load-bearing walls.</description>

      <title>Applying Information Gap Decision Theory for Uncertainty Management in Building Lifecycle Assessment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/buildings14123729</link>
      <description>Tris Kee, Frankie Fu, Buildings. 14(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404668695

                This study applies Info-Gap Decision Theory (IGDT) to manage uncertainties in early-stage lifecycle assessment (LCA) in the building sector, focusing on carbon emissions and cost optimization. The building industry significantly contributes to global carbon emissions, making robust LCA models crucial for achieving environmental improvements. Traditional LCA methods often overlook deep uncertainties, leading to unreliable outcomes. To address this, this research integrates IGDT, providing a non-probabilistic approach that enhances decision-making under uncertainty. The study develops an optimization model that considers uncertainties in material choices, supplier selection, and transportation logistics, demonstrated through a case study of a Science and Technology Expo Pavilion in Chongqing, China. The results show that manufacturing processes are the main source of carbon emissions, with transportation having a smaller but notable impact. Significant emission reductions can be achieved by using alternative materials like fly ash and volcanic ash in cement production. Strategic supplier selection, based on the cost per ton of CO2 reduction, balances environmental impact with economic feasibility. IGDT provides a robust framework for managing uncertainty, helping building projects to achieve sustainability targets even under deep uncertainty, thereby supporting the industry&#8217;s efforts towards net-zero emissions.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Numerical Study of Mechanical Properties of Concrete Containing Biochar</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.34118/jbms.v11i1.3953</link>

                The production of cement is responsible for 7% of worldwide CO2 emissions, leading to environmental threats and harm to ecosystems. Given the significant expenses involved and the necessity for substitutes such as biochar, there is a critical focus on investigating supplementary cementing materials (SCMs) to partially substitute traditional materials. The use of biochar as a concrete admixture is becoming more popular, and it has been investigated as a building material. Biochar is a solid organic residue produced by the pyrolysis of biomass. The experiment aimed to determine the mechanical characteristics of biochar-containing concrete using a concrete grade M20, cube moulds of dimension 100mm x 100mm x 100mm; cylinder moulds of 100mm x 200mm and beam formwork of dimension 150mm x 150mm x 1000mm were used to cast the control concrete sample and concrete containing varying percentages of biochar. Finite element analysis was also carried out using the ABAQUS program, utilizing concrete properties discovered through experimental study. The numerical and experimental study revealed that elevating the proportion of biochar in concrete led to about 17% decrease in compressive strength, 40% reduction in tensile strength, and about 25% reduction in the flexural strength of concrete beams. Both numerical and experimental approaches proved successful in assessing the influence of biochar on concrete.</description>

                Abstract The Russian military aggression against Ukraine has had significant global impacts on energy security, economy and geopolitics. The 2022 global energy crisis raises questions about how the war affects the energy transition and global climate policy. However, there are limited studies that incorporate its effects into self-consistent projections of alternative scenarios. This scenario study uses two leading macro-economic models and one integrated assessment model to assess how the war in Ukraine and its direct implications - trade restrictions and rising energy prices - affect economies, energy supply and demand trends, emissions and the feasibility of climate policies. The models consistently project that the disruptive responses to the war lead to a shift from fossil fuels (notably natural gas) to renewable energy and a consequent CO2 emission reduction of about 1%-5%, in the period up to 2050, both for the European Union and globally. However, projections differ across models in terms of sectoral and regional contributions to emission reductions. The results are found to be highly sensitive to the expected, yet uncertain persistence of higher fossil energy prices due to the war, which depends on the duration of the conflict, the disruption of global energy supplies and the response of other major fossil fuel exporters.</description>

                Model calibration refines design-stage inputs to align with real-world building performance. Accurate parameter selection, especially for highly sensitive variables like air leakage, is crucial. This study compared two building energy model calibration methods. The &#8220;classic&#8221; method adjusted indoor air capacitance, internal mass, and air infiltration, while a novel method focused on capacitance and internal mass, using empirical data for infiltration. The infiltration values were calculated using the decay equation and the EnergyPlus equations with site-specific coefficients. A triple validation assessed model performance in terms of temperature (CIBSE TM63), energy consumption (minimization), and indoor air quality (represented by CO2 levels in accordance with the ASTM D5157 Standard). Results demonstrated the novel method&#8217;s superiority across all three performance metrics. All calibrated models met the CIBSE TM63 criteria even during the validation period, which was five times longer than the training period. Compared to the classic method, models incorporating dynamic empirical infiltration showed a 29% and 26% improvement in MAE and RMSE, respectively, in temperature prediction. In energy consumption results, the novel method models presented a 31% reduction, and for CO2 level agreement, these models achieved a 130% higher R&#178; value than the classic model. In addition, the classic method&#8217;s infiltration values failed to meet ASTM D5157 requirements, suggesting reliance on unrealistic parameter values for accurate temperature representation. The incorporation of calculated air leakage data into the BEM allowed a more realistic estimation of capacitance and internal mass values, emphasizing the importance of accurate air infiltration modeling for overall model reliability.</description>

      <title>Aeration Optimization for the Biodrying of Market Waste Using Negative Ventilation: A Lysimeter Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/cleantechnol6040073</link>
      <description>Ye Nyi Nyi Lwin, Abhisit Bhatsada, Sirintornthep Towprayoon, Suthum Patumsawad, Noppharit Sutthasil, Komsilp Wangyao, Clean Technologies. 6(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404568179

                This study investigates the optimization of aeration rates for the biodrying of market waste using negative-pressure ventilation. Market waste, characterized by a high moisture content (MC) and rapid decomposition, presents challenges in waste management. Over 12 days, three aeration rates (ARs) of 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 m3/kg/day were examined, and the most effective continuous ventilation configuration was identified in terms of heat generation, moisture reduction, and biodrying efficiency. The results indicate that the most effective AR for heat retention and moisture removal was 0.2 m3/kg/day, achieving a 6.63% MC reduction and a 9.12% low heating value (LHV) increase. Gas analysis showed that, while AR 0.2 supported high microbial activity during the initial 7 days, AR 0.6 sustained higher overall CO2 production due to its greater aeration rate. The findings also suggest that the biodrying of market waste with a high initial MC can achieve significant weight loss and leachate generation when paired with a high aeration rate of 0.6 m3/kg/day, with a 69.8% weight loss and increased waste compaction being recorded. The study suggests that variable ARs can optimize biodrying, making market waste more suitable for conversion to refuse-derived fuel or landfill pre-treatment and improving waste-to-energy processes and sustainability.</description>

                The Compressor and Pump Station Technical Committee of Pipeline Research Council International (PRCI) has identified a need to reduce fuel and energy consumption at centrifugal compressor stations by improving the operating efficiency of centrifugal compressors at off-design conditions. It is commonplace for centrifugal compressors to operate well away from their original design point (and best efficiency point); this is generally due to (1) compressor stations needing to operate over an increasingly wide range of conditions and (2) economics favoring the installation of 1 or 2 large compressors as opposed to multiple smaller units. The objective of this project was to identify effective and impactful modifications that can be applied at centrifugal compressor sta-tions to improve operating efficiency and reduce the fuel/energy consumption. Case studies were evaluated for select technologies using historical operator data to demonstrate the performance improvement potential. For the top performing case studies, the net present value and emissions reduction were evaluated using the PRCI CO2 Economic Analysis Tool.</description>

      <title>Application of Blast-Pile Image Analysis in a Mine-to-Crusher Model to Minimize Overall Costs in a Large-Scale Open-Pit Mine in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/mining4040055</link>
      <description>Vidal F&#233;lix Navarro Torres, Fabiano Veloso Ferreira, Victor Albuquerque de Carvalho, Eltton Veras, Felipe Fran&#231;a Sit&#244;nio, Mining. 4(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404638228

                Amazon rainforests have many hidden treasures; thus, a balance between mine activities and the environment must be maintained. In the northern region of Brazil, there is a large diversity of metal ore deposits, the exploitation of which requires innovative and sustainable mining operations. Historically, mining operations have caused various environmental issues, such as landscape deterioration, damage to natural structures due to detonations, and soil and water pollution, and have also contributed to CO2 emissions from diesel trucks. Here, to estimate and minimize the operating expenses of a large-scale open-pit iron mine, a mine-to-crusher model was developed. The calibration of the mine-to-crusher model was based on rock fragmentation from the blasting phase through the primary crushing phase from an analysis of pictures of the fragmented pile. A reduction in cost was determined for an optimum 90% passing size (P90). The calibration was performed with technical and economic parameters from 2 years before. For the studied iron ore mine site, an optimum P90 value between 0.29 and 0.31 m was determined.</description>

      <title>High vulnerability of the endemic Southern Ocean snail Neobuccinum eatoni (Buccinidae) to critical projected oceanographic changes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-80353-x</link>
      <description>Rosvita Gonz&#225;lez, Luis R. Pertierra, Pablo Guerrero, Angie D&#237;az, Scientific Reports. 14(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404659606

                Climate change is projected to substantially alter the Southern Ocean's physical and chemical properties, thereby impacting its marine ecosystems and species, particularly those in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic regions. This study focuses on Neobuccinum eatoni, a polar marine 'true whelk' endemic to these regions, utilizing 166 spatially independent occurrence data records to model potential distribution shifts under future climate scenarios. Employing Species Distribution Models (SDMs) on spatially cross-validated occurrences, we achieved high predictive accuracy, identifying "sea water salinity range" at mean bottom depth as the most significant predictor of habitat preferences. Additionally, dissolved iron (minimum), ocean temperature (range), and pH (long-term maximum) emerged as critical factors influencing the species' modeled distribution. By 2050, future projections under the SSP2-4.5 scenario predict an eastward expansion, particularly in the Antarctic Peninsula, the Scotia Arc and the Weddell Sea, with an expansion in the latter region also predicted under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. However, in both scenarios, a reduction in habitat suitability is expected in certain sectors around the Antarctic continent and the Kerguelen Archipelago. By 2100, under the moderate emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5), the species is projected to move to deeper areas and lower latitudes, with notable expansions in the Weddell Sea and in the Southern Ocean surrounding the Kerguelen Archipelago. However, under the SSP5-8.5 scenario, expansion is projected in the Weddell Sea and reductions in Antarctic and subantarctic regions. This study highlights the critical influence of changing salinity on N. eatoni's distribution, predicting a significant habitat reduction under high CO2 emissions scenarios (SSP5-8.5). The findings underscore the urgent need for focused research on the vulnerability of endemic marine invertebrates to develop effective conservation strategies in the face of rapid climatic changes.</description>

      <title>Chiglitazar ameliorates dehydroepiandrosterone-induced polycystic ovary syndrome in rats</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1186/s13048-024-01554-6</link>
      <description>Fuzhen Zhao, Wei Cui, C. Fang, Yuanyuan Luo, Cheng Zhang, Journal of Ovarian Research. 17(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404520025

                Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine and metabolic disorder accompanied by ovulatory dysfunction. Insulin resistance (IR) is a key pathogenic mechanism in PCOS, and insulin sensitizers, such as metformin and pioglitazone, can improve PCOS symptoms. Chiglitazar, a pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (pan-PPAR) agonist, is also an insulin sensitizer; however, its therapeutic effects have not yet been studied in PCOS. We evaluated the therapeutic effects of chiglitazar in a rat model of PCOS. Sprague&#8211;Dawley rats aged 4 weeks were injected subcutaneously with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) (6 mg/100 g/day) to establish PCOS, and a control (CON) group was established. The rats were divided into the CON, PCOS model (DHEA), pioglitazone-treated (DHEA + PIO), and chiglitazar-treated (DHEA + CHI) groups. The DHEA + PIO group received pioglitazone (20 mg/kg/day) and the DHEA + CHI group received chiglitazar (20 mg/kg/day), each for 15 days. Body weight, estrous cycle, and glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin resistance test (ITT) results were monitored. Experimental animal energy metabolism systems were utilized to assess metabolic parameters. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was conducted to detect changes in serum hormones, including insulin, adiponectin, sex-related hormones, and lipid metabolism indicators. The ovaries were used for molecular biology experiments to detect changes in Akt/phosphorylated Akt and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression by Western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Chiglitazar and pioglitazone improved PCOS symptoms. However, chiglitazar demonstrated a more pronounced effect on lipid improvement and weight gain than pioglitazone. In the DHEA + PIO and DHEA + CHI groups, there was notable recovery in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output; substantial improvement in GTT and ITT results; an increase in adiponectin; and a reduction in serum insulin, androgens, luteinizing hormone (LH), and LH/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio. Compared with the DHEA group, the DHEA + CHI group exhibited notable decreases in triglycerides, free fatty acids, and atherosclerosis index, while the DHEA + PIO group demonstrated no changes. Granulosa cells and healthy follicles increased in ovarian sections. Ovarian steroidogenic enzymes also increased in the DHEA + PIO and DHEA + CHI groups compared with the DHEA group. Mechanistically, chiglitazar increased Akt phosphorylation. Chiglitazar significantly improved ovulation in rats with PCOS and may be a potential novel therapeutic strategy for PCOS.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Water Injection and Hydrogen Fuel on Performance and Emissions in a Hydrogen/Diesel Dual-Fuel Engine</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17235838</link>
      <description>A.G. Sharkey, Ali Zare, Energies. 17(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404585305

                As the need for alternative energy sources and reduced emissions grows, proven technologies are often sidelined in favour of emerging solutions that lack the infrastructure for mass adoption. This study explores a transitional approach by modifying existing compression ignition engines to run on a hydrogen/diesel mixture for performance improvement, utilising water injection to mitigate the drawbacks associated with hydrogen combustion. This approach can yield favourable results with current technology. In this modelling study, ten hydrogen energy ratios (0&#8211;90%) and nine water injection rates (0&#8211;700 mg/cycle) were tested in a turbocharged Cummins ISBe 220 31 six-cylinder diesel engine. An engine experiment was conducted to validate the model. Key performance indicators such as power, mechanical efficiency, thermal efficiency, indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP), and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) were measured. Both water injection and hydrogen injection led to slight improvements in all performance metrics, except BSFC, due to hydrogen&#8217;s lower energy density. In terms of emissions, CO and CO2 levels significantly decreased as hydrogen content increased, with reductions of 94% and 96%, respectively, at 90% hydrogen compared to the baseline diesel. Water injection at peak rates further reduced CO emissions by approximately 40%, though it had minimal effect on CO2. As expected, NOx (which is a typical challenge with hydrogen combustion and also with diesel engines in general) increased with hydrogen fuelling, resulting in an approximately 70% increase in total NOx emissions over the range of 0&#8211;90% hydrogen energy. Similar increases were observed in NO and NO2, e.g., 90% and 57% increases with 90% hydrogen, respectively. However, water injection reduced NO and NO2 levels by up to 16% and 83%, respectively, resulting in a net decrease in NOX emissions in many combined cases, not only with hydrogen injection but also when compared to baseline diesel.</description>

      <title>Impact of excess air factor on performance and NOx emissions of an industrial water tube boiler with hydrogen enrichment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1080/19942060.2024.2431102</link>
      <description>Mansur Aliyu, Medhat A. Nemitallah, Mohamed A. Habib, Engineering Applications of Computational Fluid Mechanics. 18(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404589550

                This study investigates the impact of excess air factor (&#955;) on performance and NOx emissions of a 207-MW boiler furnace, used for steam generation in an industrial water tube boiler installed at Saudi Aramco, at fixed volumetric fuel composition of hydrogen/methane of 10%/90%. The numerical approach employed for this investigation utilized ANSYS-Fluent software. The findings of the study revealed robust correlations between &#955;, temperature, and NO emissions. An increase in &#955; led to a decrease in both the average furnace temperature and average NO emissions at the boiler exit. Specifically, increasing the value of &#955; from 1.05&#8211;1.45 consistently reduces the average NO emissions from 1541 ppm to 653 ppm. In other words, a 27% increase in &#955; resulted in approximately a 55% reduction in NOx emissions. As &#955; increases, the volumetric absorbed of radiation decreases owing to the reduced concentrations of CO2 and H2O. Notably, the maximum combustion efficiency, reaching 37.88%, is achieved at a &#955; value of 1.35, corresponding to the lowest average flue gas temperature. The results show that to achieve the best performance with high efficiency and low NO emissions, the boiler needs to be operated at an excess air factor of about 1.35.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Study and Active Sites Investigation of Hydrogen Production from Methane and H2O Steady-State and Transient Reactivity with Ir/GDC Catalyst</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/hydrogen5040046</link>
      <description>Farah Lachquer, Jamil Toyir, Hydrogen. 5(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404567674

                Catalytic activity, mechanisms, and active sites were determined for methane steam reforming (MSR) over gadolinium-doped ceria (GDC) supported iridium (0.1 wt%) prepared by impregnation of GDC with iridium acetylacetonate. Isothermal steady-state rate measurements followed by micro-gas chromatography analysis were performed at 660 and 760 &#176;C over Ir/GDC samples pretreated in N2 or H2 at 900 &#176;C. Transient responses to CH4 or H2O step changes in isothermal conditions were carried out at 750 &#176;C over Ir/GDC pretreated in He or H2 using online quadrupole mass spectrometry. In the proposed mechanism, Ir/GDC proceeds through a dual-type active site associating, as follows: (i) Ir metallic particles surface as active sites for the cracking of CH4 into reactive C species, and (ii) reducible (Ce4+) sites at GDC surface responsible for a redox mechanism involving Ce4+/Ce3+ sites, being reduced by reaction with reactive C into CO (or CO2) depending on the oxidation state of GDC and re-oxidized by H2O. Full reduction of reducible oxygen species is possible with CH4 after He treatment, whereas only 80% is reached in CH4 after H2 treatment.</description>

      <title>Life Cycle Assessment of New Jersey Offshore Wind</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/wes-2024-143</link>
      <description>Meghann Smith, Nawal Shaoib, Pankaj Lal, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404508778

                Abstract. As offshore wind gains momentum within US renewable energy goals, New Jersey&#8217;s ambitious targets for offshore wind development represent a significant opportunity to reduce emissions and transition towards cleaner energy sources. This study presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) of a planned offshore wind farm off of New Jersey&#8217;s coast, emphasizing the implications of a domestic supply chain. Key findings show the farm is projected to produce 0.0113 kg CO2 per kWh of electricity generated, reflecting a 98 % decrease in carbon emissions compared to natural gas derived electricity. Further, when compared to carbon emissions of other renewable energy technologies, offshore wind outperforms both solar and onshore wind by 81 % and 48 %, respectively. This finding highlights offshore wind&#8217;s role in emissions reduction, as well as the importance of a domestic supply chain to mitigate transportation-related impacts. Additionally, results indicate a need to address the environmental trade-offs of offshore, as steel-intensive materials used in turbines and infrastructure contribute heavily to toxicity-related impacts. This research underscores the potential of offshore wind to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and offers insight into the environmental dynamics of offshore wind energy in the US.</description>

      <title>Divergent effects of 3-nitrooxypropanol on enteric methane emissions in Holstein and Brown Swiss cows, and its lack of synergy with Acacia mearnsii tannin extract</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.11.24.625036</link>
      <description>Z. Islam, S.E. R&#228;is&#228;nen, Tengfei He, Carmen Kunz, Yang Li, Xiaowen Ma, Aira Maye Serviento, Kai Wang, Meiqing Wang, Zhibo Zeng, Mutian Niu, bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404663640

                The objectives of this study were to investigate the combined effects of 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) and Acacia mearnsii tannin extract (TAN), and their interactions with dairy cattle breed [Brown Swiss (BS) vs. Holstein Friesian (HF)], on lactational performance, and enteric methane (CH4) emissions. Sixteen multiparous mid-lactation cows, including 8 BS and 8 HF cows were used in a split-plot design, with breed as the main plot. Cows within each subplot were arranged in a replicated 4 x 4 Latin Square design with a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments across four 24-d periods. The experimental diets were: 1) CON (basal total mixed ration), 2) 3-NOP (60 mg/kg DM), 3) TAN (3% of DM), and 4) 3-NOP + TAN. Spot samples of urine, feces, and gas emissions (via GreenFeed) were collected at the end of each period 8 times over 3 days. No 3-NOP x TAN x Breed interactions were observed for DM intake (DMI), milk production, or enteric gas emissions, except for CH4 yield (g/kg DMI) and CO2 production. Breed influenced DMI, milk production, and component yields, with HF cows consuming 3.7 kg/d more DMI, producing 9.3 kg/d more milk, and achieving greater feed efficiency and higher milk component yields than BS cows. Milk yield and energy-corrected milk (ECM) tended to increase in HF but tended to decrease in BS cows by 3-NOP. Cows fed TAN had 1 kg/d lower DMI with the tendency for 3-NOP x TAN showed greater reduction when TAN was fed alone, but milk yield, ECM, and feed efficiency remained unchanged. Cows fed TAN exhibited 18% lower milk urea nitrogen (N) concentration and 23.0% lower urinary N but 36.7% greater fecal N excretions as a percentage of daily N intake. A 3-NOP x Breed interaction was observed in CH4 production (g/d), with a 21.7% reduction in HF, and a 13.0% reduction in BS. Similarly, there were 3-NOP x Breed tendencies in CH4 yield and intensity (g/kg ECM), with reductions in HF cows of 21.8% and 23.4%, respectively, compared to 11.0% and 10.8% in BS cows. In conclusion, there were no synergistic or additive effects between 3-NOP and TAN on enteric CH4 mitigation. The enteric CH4 emission mitigating effect of 3-NOP was more pronounced in HF cows than in BS cows. Further research is needed to understand breed-specific responses and to optimize CH4 mitigation strategies for inclusion in national greenhouse gas inventories.</description>

      <title>Biomass Pyrolysis: A Comprehensive Review of Production Methods, Derived Products, and Sustainable Applications in Advanced Materials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.14416/j.asep.2024.11.009</link>
      <description>Joko Waluyo, Ibnu Tryansar Purba, Zhufara Adhil Linanggeng, Muhammad Luthfi Maulana, Ekkachai Kanchanatip, Mi Yan, Dwi Hantoko, Applied Science and Engineering Progress. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404606112

                Pyrolysis is an effective method of turning complex materials, like waste, into valuable commodities. This process stands out because it can be easily adjusted to change different parameters and improve the quality of the final products. Biomass, abundant in carbonaceous constituents, emerges as a primary candidate for pyrolysis, presenting the opportunity to generate a diverse array of carbon-based products with broad applicability and desirability, including activated carbon (AC), magnetic activated carbon (MAC), graphene, and carbon nanotubes (CNT). The study explores various methodologies of biomass pyrolysis, highlighting the factors that influence product characteristics and examining the potential applications of pyrolysis-derived products. These processes demonstrate the capability of pyrolysis technology to convert biomass into valuable carbon-based materials, which are highly sought after in applications ranging from environmental remediation and other relevant applications. AC and MAC can be synthesized from biomass through pyrolysis. At the same time, graphene and CNT can be derived from the hydrocarbon fraction of pyrolyzed biomass or through in situ exfoliation and oxidation-reduction reactions of graphite. A comprehensive examination of these facets establishes a framework for grasping the potential of pyrolysis in biomass conversion and the possibilities for commercializing the end-products. The global warming potential of graphene production is higher compared to other materials (reaching 106 kg CO2/kg), making it the most expensive material (US$ 857/cm2). The predicted global market size for the commercial viability of AC, graphene, and CNT has a steady incline, indicating a robust rising trend in demand. This increasing demand makes the production of these materials attractive and significant economically.</description>

                Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is the latest industry development, attempting to build smart systems by combining physical objects with digital innovations. The main idea behind the chapter's attempt is to empirically assess the link between I4.0 and sustainability performance, particularly in the context of green supply chain (GSC) and social responsibility (SR). In industry, data-driven investigation is required to show how I4.0 and sustainability performance are related. Thus, this chapter attempts to close this research gap by empirically assessing the link between the two paradigms. I4.0 technologies can reduce energy and resource consumption, which leads to a reduction in waste or CO2 emissions across production and supply chain processes. Smart plants support worker health and safety by enhancing working conditions, which results in higher worker satisfaction and ambition. A coordinated and proactive procedure among supply chain (SC) managers is essential to curb the environment and SCs. Supplier-customer environmental cooperation (SCEC) may be understood as the collaborative efforts made among partners to enhance understanding and support toward improving environmental performance through greener products and innovations. The idea of SR is that organizations should behave in a manner that enhances their surroundings and society as a whole. Companies with more SR always ask suppliers to be more socially responsible just for the sake of implementing SR throughout the SC management and focusing on the welfare of society, their efficiency in all aspects, and the performance of their suppliers who take part in their activities. Overall, this chapter aims to demonstrate how GSC, I4.0, and SR are interconnected and can be leveraged to enhance sustainability performance.</description>

                Abstract Background Telemedicine is increasingly common in gastroenterology and may represent an opportunity for improving sustainability in medical care. The purpose of this study was to determine the carbon emissions related to travel for in-person gastroenterology clinic appointments. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis evaluating carbon emissions associated with travel to gastroenterology appointments over a 2-week period. We determined the average number of appointments per day and used patient&#8217;s postal codes to estimate travel distances. We estimated carbon emissions based on these travel distances and completed sensitivity analyses to model methods for emissions reductions. Results We assessed 975 clinic appointments, of which 71 were excluded (eg, insufficient data, non-physician appointments), leaving 904 included appointments of which 75% were follow-up (678) and the remainder were new consultations (226). Sixteen different gastroenterologists had an average of 22.7 patients per clinic. The mean return distance travelled per appointment was 57.3 km which translates to 14.9 kg CO2 per patient visit. An average day at our clinic was equal to burning 146.6 L of gasoline or the annual carbon capture of 15.5 trees. By changing follow-up appointments or those with a travel distance over 100 km to telehealth, emissions were reduced by 77%. Conclusions We demonstrate that a relatively modest change in the number of in-person visits can save thousands of litres of gasoline emissions annually from each practicing clinician. While we cannot avoid emissions related to travel for procedure-based appointments, the use of telemedicine is one potential strategy to reduce healthcare-related emissions.</description>

      <title>Coupled Design and Operation Optimization for Decarbonization of Industrial Energy Systems Using an Open-Source In-House Tool</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/eng5040158</link>
      <description>Rushit Kansara, Mar&#237;a Isabel Rold&#225;n Serrano, Eng&#8212;Advances in Engineering. 5(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404638424

                The decarbonization of industrial energy systems which comprise different networks (such as steam, water, electric power, fuel sources) is crucial for mitigating climate change and achieving sustainability goals. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology integrated in an open-source in-house tool for the coupled design and operation optimization of energy systems in industrial settings. The proposed approach integrates advanced optimization techniques with modeling of energy systems including properties like mass flow and temperature to simultaneously optimize both design parameters and operational strategies. The methodology encompasses the optimized integration of various energy technologies, such as renewable energy technologies, energy storage, and power-to-heat technologies while considering changing operational conditions and variable energy demand and supply. A multi-objective optimization framework is employed to balance conflicting targets, such as minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, operational costs, and ensuring system reliability. The in-house tool application considering a case study based on a food industry process demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in significantly reducing carbon footprints as well as operational and investment costs compared to traditional low-fidelity methods incorporated in commercial tools. The optimized concept achieved through the in-house tool has shown 8.5% less emission (EMI) compared to the optimized designs of the commercial tool. It shows 36% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the existing facility of the case study. The optimized energy concept can be implemented in the existing facility with a payback period of 4.6 years. The outcomes of the selected use-case highlight the importance of coordinated design and operation decisions in achieving optimal performance and sustainability in industrial energy systems. It also shows an ideal workflow for making optimized design decisions to decarbonize industry with novel energy concepts. Thus, this work provides a robust foundation for future research and practical applications aimed at accelerating the transition towards low-carbon industrial processes.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations on the Quality of Power Supply to the Consumer in Novosibirsk 10/0.4 KV Electrical Networks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.25729/esr.2023.02.0007</link>

                Currently, there is a massive use of electric vehicles in the world. This is due to the ever-increasing importance and severity of the environmental safety issue. Now, there is no more convenient, affordable, popular and at the same time less harmful alternative to road transport. The annual global emissions are more than 25 million tons of pollutants of various origins, which are extremely dangerous for nature in general. On average, they increase by 3% every year. The transport sector accounts for 23% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the world. Electric vehicles can contribute enormously to the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. In 2025, sales of electric vehicles are expected to increase to 100 000 units. By 2030, the number of electric vehicles will reach 1.5 million units. However, widespread adoption of electric vehicles will cause an increase in electricity consumption. In addition, an appropriate charging infrastructure is required to power electric vehicles. It is worth noting that the market for electric vehicles and charging stations is developing dynamically with an annual growth rate up to 80%. The main barriers to the development of electric vehicles in Russia are their high cost and underdeveloped network of charging stations. The relevance of the problem is confirmed by an order signed by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin in March 2022 to allocate about 1.37 billion rubles for the creation of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in Russia. As for incentives, there are many of them. This is the need to solve the environmental problem in large cities, achieve the goal of reducing CO2 emissions and pursue industrial policy, including the policy of innovative development of the country. Another way of increasing the payback of charging stations is the employment of smart services, which can reduce the cost of technological connection through dynamic power distribution between the main facility and the charging station. There are other, more advanced solutions, which are currently being piloted, such as optimization of investment in network infrastructure, including an operator of a regional public charging infrastructure. This study focuses on the development of a power supply system to connect an electric vehicle charging station to a substation in Novosibirsk. The connected electric vehicle charger, being a non-linear load, can not only increase the load on the power grid infrastructure, but also cause a deterioration in the power quality due to the generation of harmonic distortions. Therefore, special attention is paid to the analysis of the power supply quality during the operation of the charging station by using the model developed in the MATLAB Simulink software for the analysis of harmonics.</description>

      <title>The public's pragmatic attitude to transport and what it means for achieving net zero</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/newe.12403</link>
      <description>Lorraine Whitmarsh, Stephen Frost, IPPR Progressive Review. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404546189

                Engaging the public in the shift to sustainable travel behaviours The new Labour government wishes to be seen as a global climate leader and has prioritised delivering greener transport. Among its commitments are measures to improve public transport and make streets more attractive for those walking, wheeling and cycling. These transport policies are welcomed by many, but have also attracted opposition from some politicians and media outlets, and been the focus of intense pushback in several communities. How can the government achieve net zero transport in a way that is publicly acceptable? The UK has made limited progress in reducing emissions from transport over the past three decades and transport is now the country's largest emitting sector. In standard emissions calculations, surface transport currently accounts for more carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions than aviation, with car use responsible for 52 per cent of domestic transport emissions.1 While these accounts do not adjust for non-CO2 impacts of aviation nor emissions from return flights, therefore underplaying aviation's role, reducing surface transport emissions must be central to the UK's climate commitments. Indeed, avoiding driving is frequently cited as the single most effective action that individuals can take to cut their carbon footprint, followed by switching from a petrol/diesel car to an electric vehicle (EV).2 "The transport sector is &#8230; inequitable, unhealthy and inefficient" The transport sector is also unsustainable in other ways, besides being a major greenhouse gas contributor. It is inequitable, unhealthy and inefficient. People with an annual income of more than &#163;100,000 travel almost three times further than those with an income under &#163;10,000;3 meanwhile 28 per cent of the poorest fifth of households do not have a car, compared with just 6 per cent of the wealthiest fifth.4 Dominance of car use has also contributed to rising obesity, accidents and air pollution. And road traffic is estimated to place costs equivalent to &#163;31.9 billion a year on communities in Britain, equivalent to 1.6 per cent of GDP.5 Shifting to a more sustainable transport system would therefore bring environmental, health, social and economic benefits. Technology alone cannot deliver this. Reducing emissions from transport requires profound behaviour change too. Indeed, behaviour change is needed for all levels of the 'avoid, shift, improve' sustainable travel hierarchy. Avoiding the need to travel by using digital alternatives is essential to decarbonise transport, and requires radically different ways of interacting and working. Shifting to more sustainable &#8211; public, shared and active &#8211; modes of travel means breaking car-use habits and reconfiguring travel choices. Even switching from petrol/diesel to EV requires consumers to choose greener cars, and to adapt vehicle-refuelling habits to engage with the growing EV charging infrastructure. In fact, behaviour change is fundamental to achieving net zero in all sectors. According to the Climate Change Committee, more than 60 per cent of the measures needed to reach net zero will require behaviour change by consumers, and the remainder will involve behaviour change by businesses.6 However, in 2022, a House of Lords inquiry found that the UK government's approach to achieving sustainable behaviour change was 'seriously inadequate'.7 There has been a preference for information provision to inform consumer decision-making (so-called 'downstream' measures), over incentives, regulations or infrastructure provision ('upstream' measures) that alter the attractiveness or availability of options for consumers. Yet, extensive evidence shows that information provision alone is ineffective in changing behaviour. One meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials testing behavioural interventions to promote household action on climate change found that information provision was 2 to 3 per cent effective, compared with interventions that alter choices (nudges), which are on average 25 per cent effective, and can reach 90 per cent effective. Moreover, informational approaches tend to exacerbate inequality, as they do not remove structural barriers (for example, cost or inconvenience) to behaviour change.8 "the UK government's approach to achieving sustainable behaviour change was 'seriously inadequate'" Transport behaviours are particularly driven by physical and geographical factors, such as the availability of parking or public transport routes, and by economic factors (for example, income); whereas psychological factors (such as knowledge and values) tend to be less important.9 As alluded to above, information provision is likely to be particularly ineffective to change behaviours. Moreover, travel behaviours are highly habitual &#8211; regular trips, such as commutes, become automatic and routine, and less amenable to change through information.10 Changing car-use habits requires disrupting old routines as well as creating new ones; in this sense, 'pull' measures, like creating cycle lanes or increasing bus frequency, will not suffice; 'push' measures like congestion charges or road reallocation will also be required.11 Push and pull together are needed. Cities across Europe have demonstrated how crucial push measures can be as part of an integrated plan to improve public transport infrastructure. London's congestion charge is credited with stopping three million additional journeys by car in 2019 and boosted bus travel by a third (33 per cent) on implementation.12 In Stockholm, congestion pricing achieved a 22 per cent reduction in the 10 years from its implementation in 2006, despite a growing population.13 Such initiatives defy the long-held maxim in transport policymaking that increasing numbers of people and a growing economy necessarily lead to more car use. Urban leaders who recognise the harms caused by traffic to their local economy, environment and communities have shown that an alternative path is possible. "Changing car-use habits requires disrupting old routines as well as creating new ones" Rural communities in the UK face different barriers in making changes to how they travel to their urban counterparts. Many feel that EVs, public transport and active travel are all currently out of their reach due to a lack of charging infrastructure, unsafe routes or inadequate bus and train services. In these areas, the focus must be on addressing the barriers to behaviour change, including working with rural authorities to revive the fortunes of towns that can act as anchors for local services and amenities and provide multi-modal transport hubs.14 In Cornwall, for example, car dependency is higher than in more urban regions, so the council there has been trialling shared mobility solutions, including providing credits and marketing for shared e-bikes.15 The Welsh government has also been trialling rural sustainable mobility solutions, including local working hubs and loans for e-bikes and e-cargo bikes.16 However, some policies, while highly effective in changing behaviour, can be controversial. Public backlash in response to Ultra Low Emission Zones and Low Traffic Neighbourhoods exemplifies how a vocal minority can politicise transport policy and challenge local authority efforts to promote alternatives to fossil-fuelled cars. This opposition is in part fed by the 'democratic chasm' that has opened up between communities and authorities,17 as local news services have closed and disinformation is spread online. Right-leaning media and politicians have gone as far as to call these (proposed) policies a 'war on motorists', implying that motorists constitute a definable demographic or identity group. But to what extent does this assumption reflect public views and behaviours? "Right-leaning media and politicians have gone as far as to call these (proposed) policies a 'war on motorists'" Recent research commissioned by IPPR suggests that, for the vast majority of the UK public, transport is pragmatic, not ideological.18 Owning a car is not a marker of identity in any meaningful way and people are not especially attached to their cars. In fact, people want transport systems to change and public transport is actually valued more highly than cars. Across different social groups, and regardless of whether someone is a car owner or not, there is strong support for a wide range of policies that would support achieving net zero, reducing transport costs and delivering healthier, safer streets. Notably, schemes such as school streets (which see road space opened up to children travelling actively to school) are supported by all voter segments used in this analysis. Change is hard and can be disruptive to people's daily routines, but there is a clear consensus that transport at the moment isn't working, and there is an appetite for a new approach &#8722; as long as it takes the cost-of-living crisis into account. "there is a clear consensus that transport at the moment isn't working, and there is an appetite for a new approach" The research also found that there is a lack of trust in decision-makers in relation to transport, although there is more trust in local leaders, including local authorities and mayors. It is clear that 'fairness' is a critical condition for the acceptance of transport policies &#8211; this includes distributional and procedural fairness (providing a voice for the public in decision-making). To win support for social change, authorities must listen to diverse perspectives, co-design policies that address people's concerns, and understand which narratives and language work best within their communities. Taken together with wider evidence on behaviour change and public engagement, the research report concludes that a transition to a sustainable transport system requires upstream public engagement &#8211; early and substantive involvement of citizens and communities in transport policymaking. This engagement can not only help avoid backlash but also improve the quality and effectiveness of decision-making.19 This engagement should happen at two levels: strategic involvement in national net zero policy and in developing general principles for sustainable transport policies (for example, Climate Assembly UK and Welsh Government Net Zero 2035); and the co-development of local transport schemes through place-based engagement and community relationship building. The Republic of Ireland provides a practical case study of how the UK government may approach strategic engagement of the public in the shift to sustainable mobility. The Irish government's department for transport has published its principles and practical actions to foster 'public engagement on climate action and sustainable mobility'.20 This combines an awareness of the need for supportive mainstream media messages on sustainable travel alongside fostering a shift in how the state works &#8211; recognising that engagement is a two-way process, in which government must listen and learn. The UK is long overdue a public engagement strategy for net zero,21 and should urgently adopt the best practice being set by its nearest European neighbour. "The UK is long overdue a public engagement strategy for net zero" Importantly, public engagement is not a replacement for political will and leadership. Major changes in transport norms and the redesign of public spaces have only been achieved through the willingness of leaders to engage with the evidence of what is and isn't working and make the case for trying something new. In Janette Sadik-Khan's Streetfight she details the approach taken during her time as New York's commissioner of transportation under Mayor Bloomberg. During this period, road space in the city was reallocated to social, commercial and public or active transport at a rapid pace, often using temporary materials, such as planters, with the ability to make adaptations quickly if things didn't go to plan. A clear vision, backed up by a politician willing to spend political capital, drove a culture change in what was seen as within the remit of a transport department and what was considered possible in reshaping city streets. The engagement of communities in this process, and active sharing of data on the impact of trials, helped smooth the notorious 'Goodwin curve' of public opinion &#8211; where public support drops prior to implementation but rises when benefits are realised.22 Unfortunately for New Yorkers, they are still waiting to see this approach applied to congestion charging.23 "The climate crisis requires us to change, at an unprecedented pace, how we travel The climate crisis requires us to change, at an unprecedented pace, how we travel. This does not mean changes should be rushed. The British public are pragmatists and their views on transport are shaped by what they see and experience as they go about their lives. Winning the case for change means making greener transport choices possible for more people and urgently addressing the stresses caused by many people's attempts to engage with public transport. Action must be practical, fair and rooted in empathetic engagement of the public. Delivering on the government's goals requires a new relationship between communities and transport decision-makers, and a willingness to 'move fast, and fix things' &#8211; together.</description>

                We are delighted to present this special issue of Advanced Energy Materials, which brings together research and progress on future energy conversion, next-generation batteries, and advanced green energy. This issue includes studies on solar cells, lithium batteries, display technologies, microenergy harvesting, and hydrogen production, all performed at the SKKU Institute of Energy Science and Technology (SIEST), Sungkyunkwan University. SIEST was established on March 1, 2022, to support advanced energy science and technology through collective efforts in energy conversion, storage, and harvesting. Leading-edge scientists in these fields have joined forces to enhance research collaboration and address global energy challenges. As we navigate the complex landscape of energy materials and devices, these studies and review articles offer transformative insights and solutions that push the boundaries of current technology. This issue is a testament to the innovative spirit driving the field forward, showcasing a diverse range of topics from perovskite solar cells to the development of next-generation batteries. To improve the efficiency and stability of solar cells, particularly perovskite solar cells, optimizing interface chemistry is crucial. Three topics are presented for this purpose, dealing with the interfacial reaction in perovskite solar cells by introducing novel dopants into the hole-transporting molecular layer (article number 2402144), the cation disorder engineering in chalcogenide-based absorber for improving the deposition method (article number 2402099), and carbazole-treated waterproof perovskite films to provide a solution to the perennial problem of moisture sensitivity in perovskites for better durability (article number 2401965). Cutting-edge lithium battery research is also discussed as part of the special issue. The article entitled "Navigating the carbon maze: A roadmap to effective carbon conductive networks for lithium-ion batteries" (article number 2400499) provides a comprehensive guide to optimizing carbon networks in lithium-ion batteries. The article on dual flame-retardant mechanism is helpful in suppression of thermal runaway in lithium metal batteries (article number 2304366), which can tackle the critical issue of safety, proposing mechanisms to prevent thermal runaway in lithium metal batteries. Strategies to enhance battery performance under constrained electrolyte conditions are discussed in the article entitled "Advancing post-secondary batteries under lean electrolyte conditions through interfacial modification strategies" (article number 2400035). Advances in blue energy and triboelectric energy harvesting highlight exciting developments in energy harvesting technologies. The article entitled "Advances in blue energy fuels: harvesting energy from ocean for self-powered electrolysis" introduces new methods to harness energy from ocean waves, providing a sustainable approach to hydrogen production (article number 2400563). An integrated system that combines triboelectric energy harvesting with modern communication technologies is discussed to offer potential applications in low-power devices (article number 2400481). Perovskite quantum dot technologies see rising importance in energy conversion and display-related research fields. Superfluorescence is discussed with metal halide perovskites to offer insights that could lead to highly efficient optoelectronic devices (article number 2400322). The cross-correlation between crystallinity and optoelectronic properties of perovskite thin films is discussed via multiple time-resolved spectroscopy to provide insights into optimizing device performance (article number 2400225). The question how to achieve near-perfect quantum yield in quantum dots can be answered from the article entitled "Unlocking invisible defects of ZnSe alloy shells in giant quantum dots with near unity quantum yield" (article number 2400148). Research on hydrogen production and electrochemical cells is also prominently featured by two articles. "Interface engineering to operate reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells below 500 &#176;C" (article number 2400124) presents strategies to improve the operation of protonic ceramic electrochemical cells at lower temperatures, and "Computational design of optimized modular photovoltaic electrochemical reactor for energy efficient CO2-to-Cn reduction reaction with band gap tunable perovskite tandem cells" highlighting the potential of computational design in creating efficient reactors for CO2 reduction, integrating photovoltaic and electrochemical technologies (article number 2304492). This is but a small selection of the topics covered and the diverse array of studies in this special issue underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches and technological integration in advancing energy materials and devices. From the exploration of new materials and processes to the development of innovative energy conversion systems, the contributions in this special issue pave the way for future research and applications in sustainable energy. We extend our deepest gratitude to the authors for their invaluable contributions and to the reviewers for their critical insights and rigorous evaluations. We hope this special issue inspires continued innovation and collaboration in the field of advanced energy materials.

                The plastics industry is in constant evolution looking to improve the properties of new materials and performance in different applications. Currently, the environmental impact associated with the use of plastics is one of the main concerns for the society. It was reflected in regulations at European level such as SUP Directive, Green Deal or studies such as Patents for tomorrow's plastics by European Patent Office on the trends reflected in research on alternative materials to conventional plastic. In order to transfer these new and more sustainable alternatives to an industrial and realistic environment, first applied research has to be carried out on both the development and processes of the materials to optimize their performance. In this thesis study, applied research was carried out using ultrasound technology on different nanocomposites and their transformation processes. Advances in the application of ultrasound for different transformation processes have been studied previously to ensure the approach of the practical study. This study focuses on the application of ultrasound in the process of obtaining new formulations by compounding extrusion and in injection molding, specifically in microinjection. The application of nanotechnology in the development of new materials will allow an improvement in performance and will open a range of new possibilities and applications. To explore the potential of ultrasonic molding (USM) technology, a preliminary process stability study was performed with polypropylene. The evaluation was carried out from a mechanical point of view, in which it was shown that, with an optimization of the process parameters and a correct design approach of the components with the nodal point allow a stability close to production was allowed. To deepen into the potential of USM technology in synergy with new nanocomposite formulations, a comparative study with the conventional microinjection process was performed. Two different nanocomposites based on a biopolymer matrix of poly 3-hydroxybutyrate with Cloisite 20 (organic modification), and with Cloisite 116 (unmodified) were studied. This research reveals that the USM technology, is stable obtaining micro-pieces, maintaining the chemical structure of the initial biocomposite without degrading and homogeneously achieving an exfoliation of both nanoclays. Conventional microinjection did show slight changes in the level of degradation and chemical structure, highlighting that it was not possible to micro-mold samples of the material with the unmodified nanoclay. The stabilization of the compounding extrusion assisted by an ultrasound system has been studied, with a design of a single component that allows the new approach to work in continuous condition and on pre-industrial equipment. Due to the success of the new component, it was possible to carry out the study of new formulations of polypropylene loaded with two different nanoclays (Cloisite 20 and Garamite 1958) and glass bubbles. The new nanocomposites reached the mechanical properties of a conventional material used for door panels in the automotive sector, but with a reduced density. The aim was to demonstrate that it is possible to reduce the weight of plastic components used in the automotive industry and reduce CO2 emissions for a standard vehicle. The research carried out in this thesis work has opened a new field of application to nanocomposites for weight reduction with improved mechanical properties when high level of dispersion is reached. In addition, the potential of USM technology for micro-molding applications has been demonstrated, showing high stability without material degradation during the process, and good dispersion of nano-reinforcements. El sector del pl&#225;stico est&#225; en continuo cambio en busca de mejorar sus propiedades y rendimiento en diferentes aplicaciones. Actualmente. el impacto ambiental asociado al uso de los pl&#225;sticos es una de las principales preocupaciones en el &#225;mbito social. Se puede ver reflejado en regulaciones a nivel europeo como SUP Directive. Green Deal o estudios como el que efect&#250;a la Oficina de Patentes Europeas Patents for tomorrow's plastics sobre las tendencias que reflejan las investigaciones en materiales alternativos al pl&#225;stico convencional. Para poder llevar a un ambiente industrial y realista estas nuevas alternativas m&#225;s sostenibles. primero se ha de llevar a cabo una investigaci&#243;n aplicada tanto del desarrollo de los materiales como de los procesos que pueden optimizar su rendimiento. En este estudio de tesis se lleva a cabo una investigaci&#243;n aplicada sobre diferentes nanocompuestos y sus procesos de transformaci&#243;n que pueden ser mejorados con la tecnolog&#237;a de ultrasonidos. Se ha estudiado los avances en la aplicaci&#243;n de ultrasonidos para diferentes procesos de transformaci&#243;n con el objetivo de enfocar correctamente el estudio pr&#225;ctico. Este estudio centra la aplicaci&#243;n de los ultrasonidos en el proceso de obtenci&#243;n de nuevas formulaciones por extrusi&#243;n compounding y en el moldeo por inyecci&#243;n, concretamente en microinyeccion. La aplicaci&#243;n de nanotecnolog&#237;a en el desarrollo de nuevos materiales permitir&#225; una mejora del rendimiento y abrir&#225; un abanico de nuevas posibilidades y aplicaciones. Para explorar el potencial de la tecnolog&#237;a de microinyecci&#243;n por ultrasonidos (USM}, se realiz&#243; un estudio preliminar de estabilidad del proceso con un polipropileno. La evaluaci&#243;n fue llevada a cabo desde un punto de vista mec&#225;nico, en el que se demostr&#243; que con una optimizaci&#243;n de los par&#225;metros de proceso y un enfoque de dise&#241;o correcto de los componentes que hacen intervenir el punto nodal, se puede alcanzar un nivel de estabilidad cercano a producci&#243;n. Para profundizar en el potencial de la tecnolog&#237;a USM en sinergia con nuevas formulaciones de nanocompuestos, se realiz&#243; un estudio comparativo con el proceso de microinyecci&#243;n convencional. Dos nanocompuestos basados en una matriz del biopol&#237;mero poli 3-hidroxibutirato con Cloisite 20 (modificaci&#243;n org&#225;nica). Y con Cloisite 116 (sin modificar) fueron estudiados. Este estudio revela que la tecnolog&#237;a USM adem&#225;s de ser estable en la obtenci&#243;n de micropiezas, mantiene la estructura qu&#237;mica del biocompuesto inicial sin llegar a degradaci&#243;n y alcanzando homog&#233;neamente la exfoliaci&#243;n de ambas nanoarcillas. La microinyecci&#243;n convencional si mostro ligeros cambios a nivel de degradaci&#243;n y estructura qu&#237;mica, destacando que no fue posible micromoldear muestras del material con la nanoarcilla sin modificar. La estabilizaci&#243;n del proceso de extrusi&#243;n compounding asistida por ultrasonidos ha sido estudiado, dise&#241;ando un componente &#250;nico que permite al sistema de ultrasonidos trabajar en r&#233;gimen continuo en equipos preindustriales. Gracias al &#233;xito del nuevo componente, se ha podido llevar a cabo el estudio de nuevas formulaciones de polipropileno argado con dos nanoarcillas diferentes (Cloisite 20 y Garamite 1958) y esferas huecas. Los nuevos nanocompuestos alcanzaron las propiedades mec&#225;nicas de un material empleado para paneles de puerta en el sector automoci&#243;n, pero con una densidad reducida. El objetivo fue demostrar que se puede reducir el peso de los componentes pl&#225;sticos empleados en automoci&#243;n y reducir las emisiones de CO2 para un veh&#237;culo est&#225;ndar. La investigaci&#243;n llevada a cabo en este trabajo de tesis ha permitido abrir un nuevo campo de aplicaci&#243;n a los nanocompuestos para reducci&#243;n de densidad con buenas propiedades mec&#225;nicas cuando la dispersi&#243;n es alta. Adem&#225;s, se ha demostrado el potencial de la tecnolog&#237;a USM para aplicaciones de micromoldeo, mostrando alta estabilidad sin degradaci&#243;n del material durante el proceso, y buena dispersi&#243;n de los nano-refuerzos.</description>

                Zhuqueibacterota is a novel bacterial phylum proposed based on hot spring metagenomes and public metagenome-assembled genomes, classified within the Fibrobacterota-Chlorobiota-Bacteroidota superphylum. This globally distributed phylum consists of one class and five orders, with the majority of its members being facultative anaerobes. Notably, the order Zhuqueibacterales utilizes hydrogen as an electron donor for carbon fixation through the Calvin Benson Bassham cycle. Phylogenetic and metabolic analyses reveal the phylum's key role in the carbon cycle, with frequent horizontal gene transfer events influencing its evolutionary trajectory. To the editor, The candidate phylum KSB1 has been identified as anaerobic heterotrophic bacterium and detected in various environments. However, little known about its diversity, ecology, and evolutionary history. In this study, we analyzed 30 new metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the Tengchong hot spring and 45 public MAGs. Phylogenetic analyses based on the draft genome and 16S rRNA gene indicate they form a distinct group within the Fibrobacterota-Chlorobiota-Bacteroidota (FCB) superphylum, and thus we propose their classification as a new phylum, herein Zhuqueibacterota, which contain five orders and one class. Members of Zhuqueibacterota are globally distributed and likely facultative anaerobes, with one order exhibiting autotrophy via the Calvin Benson Bassham (CBB) cycle by using hydrogen as an electron donor. Metabolic predictions at the community level suggest that Zhuqueibacterota play a significant role in the carbon fixation of hot spring. Ancestral state reconstruction points to frequent horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events throughout Zhuqueibacterota evolution. Facultative anaerobic traits appear to be ancestral, with some lineage losing hydrogen oxidation capabilities while acquiring carbon fixation capabilities through HGT in Zhuqueibacterales. These results shed light on diversity, ecological roles, and evolutionary history of Zhuqueibacterota, highlighting their significance in the carbon cycle. The earth harbors a huge biodiversity of eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms. However, only a small portion of bacteria is culturable under laboratory conditions and most bacterial phyla have no cultured members. The candidate bacterial phylum KSB1, as one of the uncultured phyla, was first identified in sulfur-rich marine sediments, and now was recognized for its broad ecological adaptability [1]. In estuary sediments, genome studies revealed its capacity for carbohydrate metabolism and &#946;-oxidation [2]. KSB1 members from hydrothermal sediment possess genes encoding benzylsuccinate synthase and alkylsuccinate synthase, suggesting a role in anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation [3]. In wetland sediments, KSB1 MAGs encode enzymes such as isopropanol dehydrogenase, phosphotransbutyrylase, and butyrate kinase, further highlighting their ecological versatility. Notably, KSB1 was also recovered from metagenomic data of hot spring, indicating KSB1 may harbor new functional niches that allow it to grow in the extreme environment. In addition, although nearly 100 MAGs of KSB1 have been reconstructed from various environments, the limited number of high-quality genomes hinders the ability to understand the ecological roles and metabolism of KSB1. Thus, more comprehensive research is needed to explore their metabolic pathways and evolutionary history. To address this, we collected available KSB1 genomes from public database and extracted new MAGs from hot spring samples. Our study significantly expands the genomic diversity of KSB1, clarify the phylogenetic relationships, and revealing its facultative anaerobic lifestyle and carbon fixation potential via the CBB cycle. We hereby designate this phylum as Zhuqueibacterota. Continuous sampling of hot springs in Tengchong County, Yunnan province, China, has been conducted for metagenomic studies since 2016, and 30 high-quality MAGs (Table S1) assigned to KSB1 were reconstructed from 16 metagenomes of hot springs. In total, 75 high-quality KSB1 MAGs were used to construct phylogenetic trees, including 45 genomes (Table S2) downloaded from GenBank. A maximum-likelihood tree, employing Bac120 marker sets from genome taxonomy database (GTDB), revealed that KSB1 forms a monophyletic clade within the FCB superphylum [4], and clearly separated from other phyla (Figure S1A). Phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA gene further supports the classification of KSB1 as a distinct phylum taxon in the domain Bacteria under the kingdom Psuedomonadati [5] (Figure S1B). To resolve the phylogenetic affiliations within phylum Zhuqueibacterota, we constructed a maximum likelihood tree with a concatenated set of single-copy marker genes. Previous analyses identified four clades within KSB1 [1]; however, our phylogenetic analysis revealed five distinct groups, corresponding to five orders of the undescribed phylum KSB1 in GTDB r214 (Figure 1A) and clarified that clade II (GTDB taxonomy: p__JdFR-76) is not part of KSB1 but a sister phylum. Average amino acid identity (AAI, 95%&#8211;100% for same species) [6], and average nucleotide identity (ANI, 95%&#8211;100% for same species) (Table S3, Figure S2) were used to classify the novel lineage on the species, which were consistent with the GTDB classification. In addition, phylogenomic tree and GTDB toolkit (GTDB-Tk) (Tables S1 and S2) based analyses were performed to classify the novel lineage on genus levels and higher taxonomic ranks. Finally, we identified 1 class, 5 orders, 14 families, 27 genera, and 40 species from the 75 MAGs (Table S4), including 9 novel species from our own 30 MAGs. Following the recommendations for defining species and higher ranks of not-yet-cultured bacteria using MAGs as type material [6, 7], we proposed the name Zhuqueibacterota phyl. nov. for the KSB1 with five orders: Zhuqueibacterales (O1), Residuimicrobiales (O2), Oleimicrobiales (O3), Thermofontimicrobiales (O4), and Oceanimicrobiales (O5). Using 16S rRNA gene sequences as queries in the IMNGS platform, Zhuqueibacterota was detected across six biotopes: aquatic, sediment, soil, hydrothermal vents, animal- and plant-associated environments (Figure 1B). The phylum is particularly prevalent in soil and biofilm samples, where it constitutes 3%&#8211;10% of biofilm-associated communities (Table S5), suggesting that biofilms may serve as a protective niche for these bacteria. Zhuqueibacterales (O1), the most widely distributed order (Figure 1C), was found in diverse environments. Residuimicrobiales (O2) and Oleimicrobiales (O3) were predominantly detected in hydrothermal vents and sediment, and Thermofontimicrobiales (O4) was enriched in marine environments. Despite limited data for Oceanimicrobiales (O5), Zhuqueibacterota's broad ecological presence (Figure 1C) highlights its adaptability across various habitats, emphasizing its ecological significance. Previous studies suggested that Zhuqueibacterota is enriched in anoxic environments [1], leading to the hypothesis of an anaerobic lifestyle. In our study, genes associated with anaerobic metabolism, such as acetyl-CoA synthetase (acs), phosphate acetyltransferase (pta), acetate kinase (ack), aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldh), and alcohol dehydrogenase (adh), were detected across all clades of Zhuqueibacterota (Table S6), suggesting they may have the ability to produce ethanol through fermentation [8]. Additionally, we identified the Rnf complexes [9] were widely distributed among Residuimicrobiales (O2), Oleimicrobiales (O3), and Thermofontimicrobiales (O4). Phylogenetic analysis of the rnfABCDEG operon indicated that they clustered with anaerobic microorganisms (Figure S3), further suggesting the potential anaerobic lifestyle of Residuimicrobiales (O2), Oleimicrobiales (O3), and Thermofontimicrobiales (O4). Remarkably, Zhuqueibacterota harbored cydAB genes, encoding the cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase, which provides an O2-directed respiratory chain under low-oxygen conditions. The coxABC genes [10] were identified in all MAGs of the Zhuqueibacterales (O1) and Oceanimicrobiales (O5), as well as in three MAGs of the Residuimicrobiales (O2) and two MAGs of the Thermofontimicrobiales (O4). Additionally, we observed that several MAGs from Zhuqueibacterales (O1) and Oceanimicrobiales (O5) encoded the aerobic aa3-type cytochrome c oxidase [10]. However, the genes of complete pathways for oxidative phosphorylation were just widely distributed in Zhuqueibacterales (O1) and Oceanimicrobiales (O5). These findings suggest that members of Zhuqueibacterales (O1) and Oceanimicrobiales (O5) may have the ability to utilize oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. Considering these observations, we propose that members of Zhuqueibacterales (O1) and Oceanimicrobiales (O5) are more likely facultative anaerobes, rather than being obligate anaerobes. Through metabolic reconstruction, all Zhuqueibacterota orders contain complete genes for glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and pentose phosphate pathways (Figure 1D). MAGs assigned to the Zhuqueibacterales (O1), Thermofontimicrobiales (O4), and Oceanimicrobiales (O5) harbor the complete gene sets for the TCA cycle. We also identified a diverse array of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) among the 75 MAGs, including 79 glycoside hydrolases (GHs), 10 glycosyl transferases (GTs), 10 carbohydrate esterases (CEs), 8 polysaccharide lyases (PLs), and 10 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) (Table S7). Interestingly, the gene encoding the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) was identified in 35 MAGs of Zhuqueibacterales (O1). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the RuBisCO large subunit (rbcL) gene belongs to form I group (Figure 2A), which plays a crucial role in carbon fixation via the CBB cycle [11]. Moreover, genes encoding RuBisCO small subunit (rbcS), phosphoribulokinase (PRK), transketolase (TKT), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBPA), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), and ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase (RuPE) were found near the rbcL gene cluster (Figure 2B). Based on these observations, we hypothesize that members of Zhuqueibacterota possess the capability for carbon fixation via the CBB cycle. Notably, the absence of sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase) and the presence of transaldolase (TAL) suggest that Zhuqueibacterota uses the transaldolase-variant of the CBB cycle [12, 13]. Carbon fixation via the CBB cycle requires significant energy and reducing equivalents, and hydrogen is a critical energy source in terrestrial hot springs [14] and hydrothermal vents [15]. Numerous prokaryotes can utilize H2 and CO2 as their energy and carbon source [16]. In our study, genes annotated to encode hydrogenases were present in Zhuqueibacterota, and the phylogenetic analyses of hydrogenases revealed five different clades ([Ni&#8211;Fe] group 1d, 3b-3d, and [Fe&#8211;Fe] group) (Figure S4). In Zhuqueibacterales (O1) MAGs, especially those containing CBB gene cluster, we identified two types of hydrogenases (Figure 2C). The [Ni&#8211;Fe]-group 1d hydrogenase, a membrane-bound hydrogenase, transfers electrons from H2 to the respiratory chain via membrane-connected cytochromes [17] (Figure S4). Additionally, the cytosolic [Ni&#8211;Fe]-group 3b hydrogenase transfers electrons generated by H2 oxidation to NAD+ [18], which serves as a reducing equivalent, for carbon fixation or for ATP production through the respiratory chain [17]. The biosynthesis and maturation of [Ni&#8211;Fe] hydrogenase are catalyzed by six Hyp proteins (hypABCDEF) [19]. The co-localization of hydrogenase maturation proteins, [Ni&#8211;Fe]-group 1 d and 3b hydrogenases (Figure 2C) indicate that Zhuqueibacterales (O1) likely utilizes hydrogen as an energy source for carbon fixation. The CBB cycle operates aerobically [20], and both the [Ni&#8211;Fe]-group 1d and 3b hydrogenases exhibit O2 tolerance, maintaining hydrogen oxidation even in the presence of oxygen. This further supports the hypothesis that Zhuqueibacterota is facultative anaerobic mixotrophy. Utilizing METABOLIC v4.0, we constructed a community metabolic network comprising with 186 medium/high-quality MAGs (completeness &gt;50% and contamination &lt;6%) derived from JZ2 hot spring (JZ2_202007). Despite being represented by only two MAGs, Zhuqueibacterota exhibited the highest relative abundance (15.48%). It contributed to 24 metabolic processes, with a relative contribution exceeding 25% (Figure S5, Table S8). Notably, Zhuqueibacterota dominated carbon fixation via the CBB cycle, with the highest contribution (57.9%) among all microbial taxa (Table S8). These findings suggest that Zhuqueibacterota, with its chemolithoautotrophic capabilities, plays a vital role in this ecosystem. To decipher the evolutionary histories of the Zhuqueibacterota, we predicted gene gain and loss events mapping onto a Bayesian tree showed that contemporary Zhuqueibacterota harbor more gene families over time (Figure 2D, Figure S6), with 71% of HGT events occurred within Zhuqueibacterales (O1), mostly from hot spring-associated MAGs. HGT played a major role in genome diversity, despite the common trend of genome reduction in hot spring environments. The ancestral Zhuqueibacterota likely possessed hydrogenase, with later loss events leading to the loss of this hydrogen utilization capability in some lineages. The cydAB gene (Figure 2E, Table S9) for high oxygen stress response was acquired early, while the coxABC gene was independently acquired by different lineages (Figure 2E, Table S9). Anaerobic fermentation-related genes were lost at multiple evolutionary nodes, potentially contributing to metabolic diversity, indicating that the ancestors of Zhuqueibacterota were facultative anaerobic bacteria. Genes related to the CBB cycle, such as rbcL, rbcS, and PRK, were acquired gradually. Over time, Zhuqueibacterota inhabiting thermal environments gained the ability for carbon fixation via the CBB cycle. In this study, we have expanded our understanding of the uncultured phylum KSB1, herein Zhuqueibacterota, by utilizing high-quality genomes to explore its diversity and function. Our analysis indicated that Zhuqueibacterota has clear functional differentiation, and distinct environmental preferences among its clades. Notably, this phylum represents a group of facultative anaerobic chemoautotrophs, which play a pivotal role in sustaining microbial communities in hot springs. Ancestral state reconstructions suggest the facultative anaerobic lifestyle of their ancestor, while carbon fixation capabilities probably evolved through HGT. Overall, this study provides new insights into the ecological functions of Zhuqueibacterota and open avenues for further research. Moreover, the findings indicate the possibility of isolating and purifying members of this phylum using the hydrogen-oxidizing autotrophic enrichment system.
