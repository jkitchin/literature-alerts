      <title>1 nm Tin Oxide Cluster for the Electrochemical Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Formate at Low Overpotential</title>

                Due to its cost-effectiveness and high product selectivity, tin oxide has been regarded as a promising catalyst for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to formate. However, formate production is hindered by the high overpotential; there is a need to reduce the overpotential to enhance energy efficiency and lower electricity cost for the implementation of carbon utilization technology. Here, we report a facile synthesis method for 1 nm-sized SnO2 cluster catalysts, which can be used for CO2-to-formate conversion. SnO2 clusters were prepared through impregnation of porous carbon with a tin precursor solution. The SnO2 clusters showed a low overpotential, generating a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a potential of -0.34 V vs. RHE in 1 M KOH. They also achieved high Faradaic efficiencies of 90.5% and 81.5% at 200 and 300 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Their electrocatalytic performance was strongly dependent on the annealing conditions, which affected the particle size, electrochemical active surface area, and metal oxidation state. This paper presents a versatile method for synthesizing metal oxide cluster catalysts, apart from providing insights into the catalytic activity for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to formate.</description>

                The electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CRR, which can convert CO2 into useful compounds at room temperature and ambient pressure by using electricity derived from renewable energy source), has been attracting attention in recent years. This is because it can convert CO2 into useful compounds, which is pertinent to establishing a next&#8208;generation recycling&#8208;oriented energy society. However, further improvement of the electrocatalyst is required to improve its activity, selectivity, and durability. Among these, copper (Cu) can synthesize various hydrocarbons from CO2 and has been the most studied electrocatalyst for the CRR over many years. In particular, regarding ligand&#8208;protected Cu particles for the CRR, the size, shape, and ligands of Cu particles prepared by chemical reduction can be precisely controlled. In this review, we summarize previous research on the size&#8208;dependence of the CRR by using Cu particles (nanoparticles and nanoclusters) prepared by liquid&#8208;phase reduction, and discuss the current status of these studies for researchers on the electrochemical CRR.</description>

                Abstract The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO 2 RR) can achieve carbon recycling through renewable electrical energy. Before releasing the full potential of eCO 2 RR, the electrocatalysts still need improvement in terms of catalytic activity, selectivity, and durability. Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) crystalline materials show a high aspect ratio with well&#8208;defined crystal structures, which are promising electrocatalysts for eCO 2 RR. In this review, we briefly discuss the typical 2D electrocatalysts for eCO 2 RR. Subsequently, we provide a summary of the different strategies to improve the catalytic performance of 2D crystalline electrocatalysts for creating and modulating active sites. Finally, we end this review with the current challenges and future opportunities of 2D crystalline materials in the eCO 2 RR.</description>

                Abstract Paired electrolysis offers an auspicious strategy for the generation of high&#8208;value chemicals, at both the anode and cathode, in an integrated electrochemical reactor. Through efficient electron utilization, routine product misuse at overlooked electrodes can be prevented. Here, an original paired electrosynthetic system is reported that can convert CO 2 to ethylene (C 2 H 4 ) at the cathode, and water to hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) at the anode under a single pass of electric charge. Amongst various investigated copper (Cu) nanomorphologies, the bespoke mixed Cu nanowire/nanoparticle catalyst recorded a peak C 2 H 4 Faraday efficiency ( FE ) of 60% following 370 h of electrolysis at 200 mA cm &#8722;2 , while the tailored boron&#8208;doped diamond (BDD) anode accumulated an unprecedented &#8776;1% w/w of H 2 O 2 in 4 m K 2 CO 3 upon applying 300 mA cm &#8722;2 for 10 h. When paired, the dual C 2 H 4 &#8208;H 2 O 2 electrochemical cell attains a combined FE of 120% for 50 h at 200 mA cm &#8722;2 , a combined energy efficiency (EE) of 69%, and a 50% decrease in the overall electrical energy consumption (EEC) compared to the individual electrosynthesis of C 2 H 4 and H 2 O 2 .</description>

      <title>Amorphous ZnSnOx Hollow Spheres Enable Highly Efficient CO2 Reduction</title>

                Carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorption and electron transport play an important role in CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Herein, we have demonstrated a new class of diverse hollow ZnSnOx (ZSO) through the amorphization of hydroxides to enhance CO2 adsorption and accelerate electron transport. The amorphization is occurred by calcination process, as indicated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectra. In particular, the ZnSnOx hollow spheres (ZSO HSs) achieve a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of HCOOH up to 92.7% at best, outperforming the commercial ZSO (Comm. ZSO, 83.9%). ZSO HSs also exhibit durable stability with negligible activity decay after 10 h of successive electrolysis. In&#8208;situ attenuated total reflectance infrared absorption spectroscopy further reveals strong adsorption of CO2 and rapid intermediate configuration transformation in amorphous ZSO HSs. This work demonstrates the practical application of ZSO for CO2RR and provides a new insight to create efficient CO2RR electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Supported Silver Catalysts for Electrocatalytic Reduction of CO2 to CO</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.33540/2122</link>
      <description>Francesco Mattarozzi, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392835293

                The work described in this thesis was aimed at understanding the influence of structural properties of silver catalysts supported on carbon for the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. This goal was achieved by rationally designing, characterizing and testing cathode materials. This enabled a correlation between material properties and the catalytic performance. Chapter 1 describes the potential benefits of electrochemistry and electrocatalysis in the context of global warming. The CO2 electrocatalytic reduction to value-added chemicals was described, including the effect of different metal electrodes and buffer electrolytes. Specifically, a background is given on the CO2RR to CO over silver electrocatalysts, and the properties of carbon electrodes, based on literature. In chapter 2, the effect of surface-modification of carbon-based electrodes on the reduction of CO2 to CO is systematically treated. The surface chemistry of the electrodes was characterized with acid-base titration, potentiometric titration and XPS. The basic surface properties (high point of zero charge) of the N functionalized carbon catalyst led to an increased CO production with respect to the O-functionalized and reduced carbon materials. The CO turnover frequency per surface group for pyridinic groups was higher than for O-containing groups. This study demonstrated the possibility to tune the surface properties of carbon materials to enhance the ability of the electrocatalyst to reduce CO2 to CO. In chapter 3, the effect of silver nanoparticle size on the CO2 reduction to CO is discussed. Using the surface modification methods described in chapter 2, control over the ligand-free silver particle size was achieved by tuning the surface properties of the carbon supports. It was demonstrated that the silver particle size, in the range of 10 to 30 nm, decreased by increasing the density of O-containing group on the support. The small nanoparticles (11 nm diameter) effectively steered the selectivity towards CO, even greater than the selectivity achieved by bulk silver electrodes under the same conditions. In chapter 4, the aim was to suppress the hydrogen formation over the high surface area carbon support by functionalizing the surface of the support with alkylamines. The effect of the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain on the HER suppression and CO selectivity was investigated. Alkylamine functionalization successfully suppressed H2 evolution, while at the same time promoting CO production. This resulted in a 1 to 2 H2 to CO ratio for the catalyst functionalized with hexylamine, more favorable than for the pristine carbon-based catalyst (benchmark), able to generate only a 3.3 to 1 H2 to CO ratio. In chapter 5, the catalytic properties of oxide-derived silver nanowires, are explored. XRD and XPS analysis confirmed that by selecting the final potential during the oxidation procedure, both different silver oxidations states and different nanowires roughness were achieved as a function of the oxidation potential. This surface-modification procedure enhanced the catalytic properties of the nanowires. The active surface-normalized CO partial current density increased 3.7-times when the pristine nanowires were oxidized to 1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl in basic electrolyte solution.</description>

      <title>The role of organic cations in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in aprotic solvents</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wl1bg</link>

                The electrochemical reduction of CO2 is sensitive to the microenvironment surrounding catalytic active sites. Although the impact of changing electrolyte composition on CO2 reduction kinetics in aqueous electrolytes has been studied intensively, less is known about the influence of the electrochemical environment in non-aqueous solvents. Here, we present data demonstrating that organic alkyl ammonium cations influence catalytic performance in non-aqueous media and describe a physical model that rationalizes these observations. Using results from a combination of kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational techniques, we argue that the interfacial electric field present at the catalyst surface is sensitive to the molecular identity of the organic cation in the aprotic electrolyte. This is true irrespective of solvent, electrolyte ionic strength, or the supporting electrolyte counter anion. Our results suggest that changes in the interfacial field can be attributed to differences in the cation-electrode distance. Changes in the electric field strength are consequential to CO2R to CO as they modify the energetics of the kinetically relevant CO2 activation step.</description>

                Purpose: This study analyzes the causal relationships between CO2 emissions and ODA, logistics, renewable energy, economic growth, and industrialization.
 Research design, data, and methodology: From 2006 to 2019, panel data related to CO2 emissions, ODA, logistics networks, renewable energy, economic growth, and industrialization were collected from a total of 84 countries. To analyze this model, panel unit root tests and panel co-integration tests were performed to confirm the stability and long-term causal relationships in the data. Subsequently, panel FMOLS and panel DOLS were used to identify variables affecting carbon dioxide, and pairwise panel Granger causality analysis was used to analyze causality between these variables.
 Results: According to panel FMOLS and panel DOLS analysis, ODA and renewable energy reduce CO2 emissions, but economic growth increases CO2 emissions.
 Conclusions: As a result of panel FMOLS and panel DOLS analysis, economic growth was identified as a factor in increasing CO2 emissions, and international development cooperation and renewable energy were identified as factors in reducing CO2 emissions.</description>

                Electrochemical co-reduction of CO2 and nitrates presents a promising alternative for urea production. However, the current electrochemical synthesis of urea faces challenges related to low selectivity and production rates. The development of high-efficiency electrocatalysts is the key to performance improvement of urea electrosynthesis. This minireview primarily focuses on the rational design of catalysts, starting with a mechanistic overview. In addition, the advancement of electrolyzers for urea electrochemical synthesis is also discussed aiming to articulate guiding principles of achieving high-rate production reaching industrial relevant level in the future.</description>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2RR) has emerged as a promising approach for generating carbon-neutral liquid fuels by utilizing excess renewable electricity to convert CO2. This thesis aims to employ atomistic simulations by using Density Functional Theory (DFT) to investigate the mechanistic details of how transition metal sulfides and electro-organocatalysts can enhance the activity and selectivity towards desired products, including those containing C-H bonds and molecules with C-C bonds. For this project, three different electrocatalysts were designed computationally.</description>
