                Numerous studies have shown a fact that phase transformation and/or reconstruction are likely to occur and play crucial roles in electrochemical scenarios. Nevertheless, a decisive factor (such as facet, phase etc.) behind the diverse photoelectrochemical activity and selectivity of various copper/silicon photoelectrodes is still largely debated and missing in the community, especially for possibly dynamic behaviors of metal catalyst/semiconductor interface. Herein, through in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope, a model system of Cu nanocrystals with well&#8208;defined facets on black p&#8208;type silicon (BSi) is demonstrated to unprecedentedly reveal the dynamic phase transformation of forming irreversible silicide at Cu nanocrystal&#8208;BSi interface, which is validated to originate from the atomic interdiffusion between Cu and Si driven by light&#8208;induced dynamic activation process. The presence of in situ formed silicide can significantly enhance photovoltage and deliver a record&#8208;high onset potential above &#8208;0.4 V versus reversible reference electrode (RHE) for photoelectrochemical CH4 production. Significantly, the adaptive junction at Cu/Si interface is activated by an expansion of interatomic Cu&#8208;Cu distance, which efficiently restricts the C&#8208;C coupling pathway but strengthens the bonding with key intermediate of *CHO for CH4 yield, resulting in a remarkable 16&#8208;fold improvement in the product ratio of CH4/C2 products.</description>

      <title>Pseudocapacitance Facilitates the Electrocatalytic Reduction of Carbon Dioxide</title>

                Abstract Electroreduction of CO 2 to value&#8208;added products is a promising strategy for CO 2 reuse, where copper has a unique ability to produce oxygenates and C 2+ products. Unfortunately, the electronic factors making copper so unique are unknown, which limits the ability to design improved catalysts. By combining in situ surface&#8208;sensitive X&#8208;ray resonant photoelectron spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, the complex electronic structure of copper is uncovered during the electrocatalytic reduction of CO 2 . It is found that the pseudocapacitive charging of copper, produced by the incorporation of protons and electrons into the subsurface, facilitates the activation of CO 2 , while simultaneously increasing the barrier for H&#8208;H coupling. The net result is that cathodic pseudocapacitive charge suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction and promotes the production of hydrocarbons and oxygenated products on copper. These results represent a new paradigm in the understanding of CO 2 reduction, highlighting the key role of pseudocapacitive charge in the reaction.</description>

                The applicability of some industrial catalysts for the process of carbon dioxide conversion into synthesis gas has been evaluated process of carbon dioxide conversion into synthesis gas. For the study were chosen catalysts on the basis of transition metals (Fe, Ni, Co) and Cu, used in large-tonnage hydrogenation processes and synthesis-gas technology: NIAP-03-01 (catalyst for steam conversion of hydrocarbon gases), NIAP-06-06 (catalyst for low-temperature conversion of CO), AmoMax 10 (catalyst for ammonia synthesis), Co-Al 2 O 3 /SiO2 (catalyst for synthesis of hydrocarbons by Fischer&#8211;Tropsch method). The catalysts were tested in the process of catalytic reduction of CO 2 by reaction reverse gaswater shift (RGWS). It was shown that Cu-containing catalyst (NIAP 06-06) possesses the highest activity and selectivity in the process of catalytic reduction of CO 2 . Under conditions of GHSV = 32000 h &#8211;1 , H 2 /CO 2 = 2, and temperatures of 500&#8211;800 &#176;C, the equilibrium of the RGWS reaction is achieved by 97 %. Due to selection of technological parameters of CO 2 reduction (temperature, H 2 /CO 2 ratio) it is possible to obtain synthesis gas of the required composition. Due to selection of technological parameters of CO 2 reduction (temperature, H 2 /CO 2 ratio) it is possible to obtain synthesis gas of the required composition for the synthesis of hydrocarbons and methanol.</description>

      <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Urea from Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate over a Cu2O Photocathode</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202406515</link>
      <description>Min Li, Qiujin Shi, Zhenhua Li, Min Xu, Shixin Yu, Ye Wang, Simin Xu, Haohong Duan, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399096957

                Transformation of carbon dioxide and nitrate ions into urea offers an attractive route for both nitrogen fertilizer production and environmental remediation. However, achieving this transformation under mild conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient photoelectrochemical method for urea synthesis by co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrate ion over a Cu2O photocathode, delivering urea formation rate of 29.71&#177;2.20 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 12.90&#177;1.15 % at low external potential (&#8722;0.017 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). Experimental data combined with theoretical calculations suggest that the adsorbed CO* and NO2* species are the key intermediates, and associated C&#8722;N coupling is the rate&#8208;determining step. This work demonstrates that Cu2O is an efficient catalyst to drive co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; to urea under light irradiation with low external potential, showing great opportunity of photoelectrocatalysis as a sustainable tool for value&#8208;added chemical synthesis.</description>

                Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to accomplish the CO2 net emission. Ni-based single-atom catalysts (Ni-SACs) with the Ni-N-C structure have been the hotspot in this field. However, its catalytic activity is still unsatisfied. Regulation of the coordination environment of the active site via heteroatom doping is an efficient strategy to improve its catalytic characteristics and activity. Herein, the heteroatom phosphorus is introduced into the N-doped carbon supporter to form Ni-SA/CN-P catalyst achieving the CO Faraday efficiency of 91.8% at a potential of -1.1 V along with the CO current density 91.2 mA cm-2 in the flow cell, which is superior to the sample Ni-SA/CN without P dopant. It is attributed that the more defects are built in the Ni-SA/CN-P catalyst due to the different atomic radiuses of P and N atoms. Moreover, the gap between d-band center and Femi energy level is narrowed due to the doped P atoms, which reduces the rate-limiting barrier height leading to the promoted catalytic performance. The cooperation of various items finally results in the overall performance. This work provides a simple method for establishing single-atom catalysts with P doping to improve catalytic performance for CO2RR.</description>

                The extensive utilization of fossil fuel energy has caused severe degradation to our environment, therefore the search for new clean efficient energy is the need of the hour. Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to solar fuels, and artificial photosynthesis, offer a promising solution for the energy crisis and global warming. Improving efficiency in the photo-reduction of CO2 to fuels involves developing highly efficient catalysts and optimizing photoreactor configuration. Photocatalysis is a process in which light radiations having energy equal to or greater than the band gap energy (Ebg) of a semiconductor strikes on its surface and generates electron (e&#8722;) hole(h+) pairs. The photogenerated electrons and holes participate in various oxidation and reduction processes to produce final products. This field focuses on harnessing solar energy to drive the conversion of carbon dioxide into hydrocarbon fuels, showcasing significant potential for sustainable energy solutions. The global methanol market was valued at $30.9 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $38 billion by 2028, growing at 4.2% CAGR during the forecast period. For determining the feasibility of reactions on a larger scale, simulations must be performed at different conditions for obtaining higher conversion and cost-effective management of the process at the industrial level. So, a simulation of methanol photoreactors using different software was done to examining the kinetics of methanol reactors by employing ASPEN, DWSIM, and MATLAB software for simulating experimental data.</description>

      <title>Deactivation of Copper Catalysts During CO2 Reduction Occurs via Dissolution and Selective Redeposition Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wfs77</link>

                As electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) approaches industrialisation levels, addressing the challenge of uncontrolled restructuring and deactivation of copper (Cu) catalysts during operation is essential for the regulation of this phenomenon. Two different catalysts were prepared, each showing distinct changes in ECR products selectivity over prolonged operation. The detection of dissolved Cu species during electrolysis confirms the intermediates mediated Cu0(s) dissolution mechanism at ECR potential, namely -0.8 to -1.1 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode. A dynamic equilibrium between dissolution and subsequent redeposition leads to morphological restructuring. Additionally, our findings suggest that the electrodeposition of dissolved Cu species is biased towards less active sites due to their lower coverage by reaction intermediates such as adsorbed CO. The iterative cycles of the dissolution-redeposition mechanism at ECR potential lead to the growth of the less-active Cu surface at the cost of the more-active one. This gradual yet persistent restructuring mechanism consequently shifts selectivity away from ECR and towards hydrogen production. Both catalysts exhibited this general behaviour, although at different rates.</description>

                The practical application of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to form formic acid fuel is hindered by the limited activation of CO2 molecules and the lack of universal feasibility across different pH levels. Herein, we report a doping&#8208;engineered bismuth sulfide pre&#8208;catalyst (BiS&#8208;1) that S is partially retained after electrochemical reconstruction into metallic Bi for CO2RR to formate/formic acid with ultrahigh performance across a wide pH range. The best BiS&#8208;1 maintains a Faraday efficiency (FE) of ~95% at 2000 mA cm&#8208;2 in a flow cell under neutral and alkaline solutions. Furthermore, the BiS&#8208;1 catalyst shows unprecedentedly high FE (~95%) with current densities from 100 to 1300 mA cm&#8208;2 under acidic solutions. Notably, the current density can reach 700 mA cm&#8208;2 while maintaining a FE of above 90% in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer and operate stably for 150 h at 200 mA cm&#8208;2. In&#8208;situspectra and density functional theory calculations reveals that the S doping modulates the electronic structure of Bi and effectively promotes the formation of the HCOO* intermediate for formate/formic acid generation. This work develops the efficient and stable electrocatalysts for sustainable formate/formic acid production.</description>

      <title>Photoexcitation and One-Electron Reduction Processes of a CO2 Photoreduction Dyad Catalyst Having a Zinc(II) Porphyrin Photosensitizer</title>

                We have explored the photophysical properties and one electron reduction process in the dyad photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction, ZnP-phen=Re, in which the catalyst of fac-[Re(1,10-phenanthoroline)(CO)3Br] (phen=Re) is directly connected with the photosensitizer of zinc (II) porphyrin (ZnP), using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations. We revealed the photophysical properties that (1) the intersystem crossing occurs with a time constant of ~20 ps, which is more than 50 times faster than that of zinc (II) porphyrin, and (2) the charge density in the excited singlet and triplet states is mainly localized on ZnP, which means the excited state is assignable to the &#960; -&#960;* transition in ZnP. The one electron reduction using the reductant, 1,3-dimethyl-2-,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH), occurs via the triplet excited state with time constant of ~170 ns and directly from the ground state by the deprotonated BIH with the time constant of ~3 &#956;s. The charge in the one electron reduction species spans ZnP and the phenanthroline ligand and the dihedral angle between ZnP and the phenanthroline ligand is rotated by ~24&#176; with respect to that in the ground state, which presumably offers an advantage for proceeding to the next CO2 reduction reaction step. These findings on the initial processes of CO2 photoreduction would help us to design novel dyad photocatalysts using porphyrin photosensitizers.</description>

                The extensive use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) has appeared as a significant area of investigation in contemporary study. The single-atom catalyst, characterized by its maximum atomic proficiency and great discernment of the transition-metal center, has a unique combination of benefits from both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts. Consequently, it effectively bridges the gap between these two types of catalysts, leveraging their distinctive features. The utilization of SACs immobilized on graphene substrates has garnered considerable interest, primarily because of their capacity to facilitate selective and efficient photocatalytic processes. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the progress and potential uses of SACs made from graphene in photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and hydrogen (H2) generation. The focus is on their contribution to converting solar energy into chemical energy. The present study represents the various preparation methods and characterization approaches of graphene-based single-atom photocatalyst This review investigates the detailed mechanisms underlying these photocatalytic processes and discusses recent studies that have demonstrated remarkable H2 production rates through various graphene-based single-atom photocatalysts. Additionally, the pivotal roleof theoretical simulations, likedensity functional theory (DFT), to understand the structural functional relationships of these SACs are discussed. The potential of graphene-based SACs to revolutionize solar-to-chemical energy conversion through photocatalytic CO2 reduction and H2 production is underscored, along with addressing challenges and outlining future directions for this developing area of study. By shedding light on the progress and potential of these catalysts, this review contributes to the collective pursuit of sustainable and efficient energy conversion strategies to mitigate the global climate crisis.</description>

      <title>An efficient Z-type CeO2/BiOBr heterostructure with enhanced photo-oxidation degradation of o-DCB and CO2 reduction ability</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.124248</link>
      <description>Juanjuan Sun, Yuxuan Zhang, Shiying Fan, Xinyong Li, Qidong Zhao, Applied catalysis. B, Environmental. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399107840

                The Z-type CeO2/BiOBr heterostructures were skilfully designed by assembling CeO2 nanoparticles onto the surface of BiOBr microflowers. This composite photocatalyst demonstrates efficient photo-oxidation degradation ability for o-DCB and CO2 reduction ability. Through analyses of its morphology, microstructure, XPS spectra, low-temperature ESR, SPV, and charge transfer dynamics (TPV and TR-PL), the paper elucidates the superior performance of the CeO2/BiOBr composite and discusses its photocatalytic mechanism. The enhanced photo-oxidation degradation ability and CO2 reduction performance of the heterostructure, compared to the individual CeO2 and BiOBr components, indicate that this Z-scheme microstructure effectively promotes the recombination of photogenerated holes the valence band (VB) of the BiOBr with the electrons in the conduction band (CB) of the CeO2, leading to the abundant carriers surviving in the corresponding energy bands. This study provides valuable insights into the rational design of Z-type heterostructures for advanced photocatalytic applications.</description>

                We constructed an integrated system comprising direct air capture (DAC) and direct carbonate reduction (DCR) to facilitate the industrial implementation of negative CO2 emissions. The DAC-DCR system demonstrated continuous CO synthesis from ambient air at room temperature, in contrast to conventional methods, including high-temperature processes and previously reported a batch-type method that connect DAC and DCR. The CO2-absorbing electrolyte, a K2CO3-KHCO3 aqueous solution, is circulated between the DAC and DCR subsystems. The CO2 captured from the air with the CO2-absorbing electrolyte is converted to carbonate in the DAC; subsequently, the carbonate is electrochemically reduced to CO in the DCR. This system monitored the CO2 capture rate, carbonate reduction rate, and pH of the CO2-absorbing electrolyte in real time. Controlling the carbonate reduction rate by adjusting the DCR reactor current enabled the balancing of carbon capture and carbonate reduction rates. Consequently, stable and continuous operation of a DAC-DCR system was achieved for over one hour for the first time. The DAC-DCR is more suitable for combination with intermittent renewable electricity, including photovoltaic and wind electricity, than the previous methods because all the processes in the system work at room temperature. Thus, the present proof-of-concept study is an important step toward the widespread use of DAC.</description>

      <title>Carbon Pricing Impacts on Four Pollutants: A Cross-Country Analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17112596</link>
      <description>Rohan Best, Fatemeh Nazifi, Han Cheng, Energies. 17(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399091965

                Research on climate change mitigation has increasingly considered carbon pricing, with these efforts concentrating on reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Our comprehensive cross-country analysis extends this focus by quantitatively evaluating the effects of carbon pricing on four major pollutants: CO2, nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and particulate matter (PM). We use regressions and introduce entropy balancing to this research area. Analyzing data from 132 countries from 1992 to 2019, we find that carbon pricing is associated with an average annual reduction in CO2 emissions by 3 percentage points. A one-unit increase in a coverage-weighted carbon price is associated with reductions in N2O emissions by approximately 0.1 percentage points. A shorter panel for 2010&#8211;2017 shows a larger impact of 0.3 percentage points for PM. These findings underline the efficacy of carbon pricing not just in curtailing CO2 but in significantly mitigating other harmful pollutants on a global scale. Reductions in pollutants beyond CO2 provide further motivation for policymakers to pursue carbon pricing.</description>

      <title>Optimization of superstructure network in the CCS/CCSU system for CO &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction from exhaust gas industry and gas field in Indonesia as archipelago state</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1080/00986445.2024.2356829</link>
      <description>Vibianti Dwi Pratiwi, Renanto Handogo, Rendra Panca Anugraha, Juwari Juwari, Rizal Arifin, Chemical engineering communications. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399126777

                Industrial exhaust gases and gas fields are two significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that contribute to the rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. Among the various emission reduction systems, the CCSU (Carbon Capture, Storage, and Utilization) system has garnered extensive attention and research. This research aims to obtain the superstructure network sequentially in the CCSU system using GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System). A mathematical approach was developed to optimize the amount of CO2 stored and utilized by varying the time difference (dt) between the source and sink from 0 to 10 years. After calculating the economic potential (EP), it was found that the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) system for both sources has a negative impact. In contrast, the CCSU system enhances the economic potential (EP) by generating a positive value. This is possible as the captured CO2 can be sold to the utilization sink, thereby creating a revenue stream. The EP for CO2 reduction from gas fields is greater than that from the industry, 21.68 &#215; 106 USD compared to 12.50 &#215; 106 USD at dt min10 years. The CCSU system, when utilizing CO2 sources from gas fields, is more profitable compared to using industrial emissions.</description>

      <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Urea from Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate over a Cu2O Photocathode</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202406515</link>
      <description>Min Li, Qiujin Shi, Zhenhua Li, Min Xu, Shixin Yu, Ye Wang, Simin Xu, Haohong Duan, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399097688

                Transformation of carbon dioxide and nitrate ions into urea offers an attractive route for both nitrogen fertilizer production and environmental remediation. However, achieving this transformation under mild conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient photoelectrochemical method for urea synthesis by co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrate ion over a Cu2O photocathode, delivering urea formation rate of 29.71&#177;2.20 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 12.90&#177;1.15 % at low external potential (&#8722;0.017 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). Experimental data combined with theoretical calculations suggest that the adsorbed CO* and NO2* species are the key intermediates, and associated C&#8722;N coupling is the rate&#8208;determining step. This work demonstrates that Cu2O is an efficient catalyst to drive co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; to urea under light irradiation with low external potential, showing great opportunity of photoelectrocatalysis as a sustainable tool for value&#8208;added chemical synthesis.</description>

                Reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is a global priority. The concrete industry has a major role in this reduction since it accounts for about 8% of global CO2 emissions. Despite significant improvements in the sustainability of the production of concrete, one of the best solutions is still to improve the design and construction methods, such that the required quantities of concrete are reduced. Using, as a reference, a real case study, this study compares alternative shaft construction methodologies from engineering and sustainability points of view, highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of each solution. To achieve this purpose, a back analysis is performed to ensure that the numerical model is accurately calibrated and the shaft construction methods can be adequately assessed. The results show that, while the considered methods are applicable and satisfy engineering requirements, the characteristics of the lining of the shaft could have been optimized, resulting in a reduction in CO2 emissions by at least 50% without compromising the safety of the construction.</description>

      <title>Effect of ammonia energy ratio and load on combustion and emissions of an ammonia/diesel dual-fuel engine</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2024.131860</link>
      <description>Yanhui Chen, Jian Zhang, Zhiqing Zhang, Bin Zhang, Jingyi Hu, Weihuang Zhong, Yanshuai Ye, Energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399142958

                Ammonia is receiving increasing attention as a zero-carbon fuel. However, it is difficult to use alone because of its high auto-ignition temperature. Therefore, in this paper, the effects of four ammonia energy ratios (15%, 30%, 45%, and 60%) on the combustion and emission characteristics of the engine at different loads were studied by using the ammonia/diesel dual-fuel strategy. The results indicated that the presence of ammonia lowered the combustion temperature at all loads, thereby lowering the cylinder temperature and cylinder pressure. In addition, the HRR first increased and then decreased as the ignition delay increased with the increase in ammonia energy ratio. In terms of emissions, at 100% load, the CO2 and NO of the D40A60 were 65.5% and 88.14% lower than that of the D100. The decrease in CO2 was due to more carbon-based fuels being replaced by ammonia. The decrease in NO was due to the decomposition of NO by the thermal deNOx reaction resulting from the lower combustion temperature. The emissions of N2O produced by partial ammonia oxidation offset the greenhouse gas emission reduction effect caused by the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Further optimization of the engine combustion strategy is still needed in the future.</description>

                The escalating atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to human pursuit which includes fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial production make contributions considerably to international warming and climate change. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and usage (CCU) technology provide viable solutions for mitigating those emissions. This paper critiques various CCS and CCU techniques that specialize of their ability applications, stressful situations, and environmental impacts. While CCS technologies provide promising consequences in decreasing international warming capability, they're associated with better acidification and human toxicity in comparison to standard techniques. Alternatively, CCU technologies present an opportunity to convert CO2 into valuable products, thereby imparting a sustainable approach to greenhouse gas reduction. But, these technology face challenges consisting of high expenses, energy consequences, and the need for social recognition. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of modern CCS and CCU technologies, evaluates their environmental affects, and discusses future prospects for their implementation in reducing industrial CO2 emissions.</description>

      <description>Dimitrios Komnos, Robin Smit, Le&#243;nidas Ntziachristos, Georgios Fontaras, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399058767

                Regulators across the world introduce measures to improve the energy consumption and greenhouse emissions of road-vehicles. The present study focuses on the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Fuel Efficiency standards attempting an evaluation of their effectiveness, using vehicle and fleet modelling. The model has been validated against certified values, and was subsequently used to calculate real-world fleet performance in an effort to quantify the actual emissions savings. To obtain a robust counterfactual result, two regions are compared as a case study: the European Union (EU), where CO2 emissions have been regulated for more than fifteen years, and Australia, a region without such regulation. The average difference of the certified CO2 emissions registered in the two regions increased from 50 g/km in 2018 to 60 g/km in 2021 due to accelerated electrification in the EU. The real-world CO2 emissions in the registered fleets for 2021 were estimated to be 143 g/km and 207 g/km for the EU and Australia respectively, a difference of 45%. Projections of the influence on the total in-use CO2 emissions of the new vehicles demonstrate the importance of deploying standards in a way that promotes efficiency and weight reduction in addition to absolute tailpipe emissions reduction.</description>

      <title>Bioconversion of carbon dioxide and zero valent iron to methane by anaerobic sludge: Kinetics and archaeal consortium</title>

                Using carbon dioxide (CO2) as a carbon source for renewable energy production has potential applications for CO2 sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction. In biological conversion, CO2 can be transformed into methane (CH4) by hydrogenotrophic methanogens with hydrogen (H2) as an energy source. In this study, zero-valent iron (ZVI) of 16, 32, 64, and 96 g/L was used as the H2 energy source for a bioconversion of CO2 to CH4. When the ZVI dosage was increased, a decrease in CO2 in the headspace occurred simultaneously with the increase in CH4. The presence of CH4 in both CO2/H2 and CO2/ZVI indicates that hydrogenotrophic methanogens can utilize both ZVI and H2 as electron donors and convert CO2 to CH4. The highest methane yield of 1.728 mmol CH4/mmol CO2 was observed for the CO2/ZVI 96 g/L. The modified Gompertz equation fitted the cumulative CH4 production curves of CO2/H2 and CO2/ZVI very well, where R 2 was 0.9915 and 0.9903-0.9968, respectively. 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing results revealed that ZVI addition facilitated the increase of the family Methanobacteriaceae, which became the most abundant among other archaea. It points out that this family favors ZVI and utilizes electrons more effectively from ZVI than H2.</description>

                Electric-driven heat pump systems, commonly used for space heating and cooling in buildings, have emerged as a crucial component in integrating with the power grid, promoting clean electricity consumption. This paper introduces a high-efficiency space heating and cooling system that combines heat pumps with medium-depth ground heat exchangers and a cooling tower. Additionally, it employs a heat storage system for daily thermal and cooling storage. The system encompasses a design methodology and control strategy optimized for maximizing the use of local photovoltaic power generation and municipal clean power sources. Furthermore, the paper presents a case study of a large public building, including a quantitative analysis to assess its energy-saving capabilities and CO2 emission reduction impacts. Results showed that the proposed system has a payback period of less than six years and reduces carbon dioxide emissions by over 14,900 tons, showcasing substantial energy savings and emission reduction benefits.</description>

      <title>Chemical and biological effects of zero-valent iron (ZVI) concentration on in-situ production of H2 from ZVI and bioconversion of CO2 into CH4 under anaerobic conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.119230</link>
      <description>Maneerat Khemkhao, Vichai Domrongpokkaphan, Sasikarn Nuchdang, Chantaraporn Phalakornkule, Environmental research. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399051734

                The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) is a strategy for sequestering CO2. Zero-valent iron (ZVI) has been proposed as an alternative electron donor for the CO2 reduction to CH4. In this study, the effects of ZVI concentrations on the abiotic production of H2 (without the action of microorganisms) in the first part and on the biological conversion of CO2 to CH4 using ZVI as a direct electron donor in the second part were examined. In the abiotic H2 production, the increase in the ZVI concentration from 16 to 32, 64, and 96 g/L was found to have positive effects on both the amounts of H2 generated and the rates of H2 production because the extent of ZVI oxidation positively correlates with increasing surface area. Nevertheless, the increase in ZVI concentration from 96 to 224 g/L did not benefit the H2 production because the ZVI dissolution was suppressed by the increasing aqueous pH above 10. In the bioconversion of CO2 to CH4 using ZVI as an electron donor, the main methanogenesis pathway occurred via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at pH 8.7&#8211;9.5 driven by the genus Methanobacterium of the class Methanobacteria. At ZVI concentrations of 64 g/L and above, the production of volatile fatty acid (VFA) became clear. Acetate was the main VFA, indicating the induction of homoacetogenesis at ZVI concentrations of 64 g/L and above. In addition, the presence of propionate as the second major VFA suggests the production of propionate from CO2 and acetate under conditions with high H2 partial pressure. The results indicated that the pathway for ZVI/CO2 conversion to CH4 was competitive between hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis.</description>

      <title>Primary Metabolic Response of Aristolochia contorta to Simulated Specialist Herbivory under Elevated CO2 Conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/plants13111456</link>
      <description>Hyeon Jin Jeong, Bo Eun Nam, S. Jeong, Gisuk Lee, Sang&#8208;Gyu Kim, Jae Geun Kim, Plants. 13(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398783531

                This study explores how elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels affects the growth and defense mechanisms of plants. We focused on Aristolochia contorta Bunge (Aristolochiaceae), a wild plant that exhibits growth reduction under elevated CO2 in the previous study. The plant has Sericinus montela Gray (Papilionidae) as a specialist herbivore. By analyzing primary metabolites, understanding both the growth and defense response of plants to herbivory under elevated CO2 conditions is possible. The experiment was conducted across four groups, combining two CO2 concentration conditions (ambient CO2 and elevated CO2) with two herbivory conditions (herbivory treated and untreated). Although many plants exhibit increased growth under elevated CO2 levels, A. contorta exhibited reduced growth with lower height, dry weight, and total leaf area. Under herbivory, A. contorta triggered both localized and systemic responses. More primary metabolites exhibited significant differences due to herbivory treatment in systemic tissue than local leaves that herbivory was directly treated. Herbivory under elevated CO2 level triggered more significant responses in primary metabolites (17 metabolites) than herbivory under ambient CO2 conditions (five metabolites). Several defense-related metabolites exhibited higher concentrations in the roots and lower concentrations in the leaves in response to the herbivory treatment in the elevated CO2 group. This suggests a potential intensification of defensive responses in the underground parts of the plant under elevated CO2 levels. Our findings underscore the importance of considering both abiotic and biotic factors in understanding plant responses to environmental changes. The adaptive strategies of A. contorta suggest a complex response mechanism to elevated CO2 and herbivory pressures.</description>

      <title>Embodied Carbon in New Zealand Commercial Construction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17112629</link>
      <description>David H. Finnie, Rehan Masood, Seth Goldsworthy, Benjamin Harding, Energies. 17(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399185883

                Decarbonization is gaining priority from the macro to the micro level. However, achieving this is a critical challenge, as industries are still immature. This study explores the practices used to calculate and reduce embodied carbon (EC) in New Zealand (NZ) commercial construction projects. In the Paris Agreement, NZ pledged to reduce its net GHG emissions to 50 percent below the gross 2005 levels by 2030. The built environment generates approximately 40% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with 11% being generated by manufacturing materials. EC represents carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the atmosphere throughout the extraction, fabrication, transportation, and assembly of building materials. A survey questionnaire was distributed to stakeholders in commercial construction via the New Zealand Institute of Quantity Surveyors (NZIQS) open forum. Twenty-seven valid responses were analyzed. The survey tested and expanded on the interview findings. Calculating and reducing EC are not mandatory in NZ. Most industry professionals had yet to experience EC calculation in projects. Clients most commonly drive EC reduction in public projects with calculations that are often conducted during the concept or detailed design stages. The challenges in measuring and lowering EC include a lack of client willingness to fund EC calculation, lack of knowledge and experience, lack of previous cost data, lack of EC materials, and lack of fit-for-purpose EC calculation tools. These findings may inform NZ government policy initiatives supporting EC reduction to meet their 2050 target.</description>

                This experiment studies the suitability of n-propanol in biofuel for the performance improvement of the Spark Ignition Engine (SIE). Literature reported performance limitations of SIE with Ethanol-Gasoline (EG) blends. N-propanol can be an additive due to its good calorific value and non-separating properties. Various blends such as EG, Propanol-Gasoline (PG), and Propanol-Ethanol-Gasoline (PEG) were tested to assert their best potential in an SIE. Experimentation was conducted on a 4-stroke petrol test engine running at 2800 rpm with low fuel blend concentrations and varying Compression Ratio (CR) to investigate its effects on the performance of SIE. Increasing CR improved PEG-fueled engine performance more than gasoline-fueled engines, such as Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) and Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC), and decreased emissions like Carbon Dioxides (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Unburnt Hydrocarbons (HCs). The performance of SIE mainly compared E10 (10% ethanol in gasoline) and E10Pr1.5 (10% ethanol and 1.5% propanol in gasoline) biofuels at different CRs. As compared to E10, E10Pr1.5 reported an increase in BTE from 0.43-0.83%, a significant decrease in BSFC from 0.05-0.37%, a reduction in CO emission from 6.85-9.78%, and a decline in HCs emission from 2.16-3.69%, at different CRs (4.67-7.5) respectively. Results show that a 1.5% addition of propanol in E10 biofuel improves the performance of SIE compared to pure gasoline and EG blend with 10% ethanol in gasoline. E10Pr1.5 shows the highest BTE, lowest BSFC, and lowest emissions of CO and HCs for different CRs. Propanol can be used as a fuel additive in the EG biofuel.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Multi-Criteria Decision Support Model for Sustainable Ship Queuing Policy Application via Vessel Traffic Service (VTS)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114615</link>
      <description>Ozden B. Caglayan, Murat Aymelek, Sustainability. 16(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399176743

                The International Maritime Organization (IMO) persistently improves policies to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from maritime operations, emphasizing the significance of operational measures. Simultaneously, heightened recognition of collaborative efforts within the maritime sector has increased the applicability of arrival policies like Just-In-Time Arrival (JITA), aimed at curtailing unnecessary anchorage time and emissions affecting adjacent communities in port vicinities. Nevertheless, ongoing initiatives advocate adopting JITA over the prevailing First Come, First Served (FCFS) policy, which is perceived as inefficient and, in the meantime, fair in the shipping industry. This research introduces an integrated decision support model to facilitate the implementation of a sustainable ship queuing policy by the VTS. The model addresses critical concerns, including the priorities of relevant authorities, the duration of nautical services for incoming vessels, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions attributable to anchorage waiting times. The decision support framework presented integrates the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and PROMETHEE II methodologies; the study&#8217;s outcomes suggest that the model significantly reduces ships&#8217; unnecessary CO2 emissions during anchorage waiting periods compared to the FCFS policy, with reduction rates ranging from 32.8% to 45% based on case analysis. Moreover, the proposed model ensures fairness by treating competing arriving ships equitably according to predefined criteria.</description>

      <title>Harness the Co-Benefit and Avoid the Trade-off: The Complex Relationship between Income Inequality and Carbon Dioxide Emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soae074</link>
      <description>Xiaorui Huang, Social forces. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399024238

                Abstract Given the dual crises of climate change and rising economic inequality, it is imperative to improve the synergy between climate mitigation and income inequality reduction. Domestic income inequality is linked to nations&#8217; carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions through multiple theorized pathways. Using a multidimensional framework, multiregional input&#8211;output analysis, panel regression analysis, and a sample of 34 high-income nations from 2004 to 2015, I investigate the relationships between nations&#8217; income inequality and four components of CO2 emissions with distinct implications for climate change mitigation: (1) emissions generated by domestic-oriented supply chain activities; (2) emissions embodied in exports; (3) direct emissions from end-user activities; and (4) emissions embodied in imports. I theorize that income inequality is heterogeneously related to the four emission components via different pathways. Results show that the relationships vary across emission components, change over time, and differ between inequality measures. The Gini coefficient is generally less influential on CO2 emissions than the income share of the top 10%. Notably, the income share of the top 10% is negatively related to direct end-user emissions from 2009 to 2011 and positively related to emissions in exports from 2011 to 2015, indicating variations in pathways both across emission components and over time&#8212;especially during and after the Great Recession. The findings underscore the multidimensionality in the income inequality-CO2 emissions relationship. Whether reducing income inequality can generate the co-benefit of emission abatement while avoiding a potential trade-off is a context-specific question that requires careful policy design and implementation.</description>

      <title>Effect of outdoor ageing on pyrolytic characteristics and kinetics of different organic components in waste photovoltaic panels</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2024.106565</link>
      <description>Louzhen Fan, Junyu Tao, Jia Zhang, Yunan Sun, Linwang Yuan, Zhanjun Cheng, Beibei Yan, Guanyi Chen, Journal of analytical and applied pyrolysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399057084

                Pyrolysis is a potential approach for volume reduction and utilization of organic components in waste photovoltaic panels. During a usage period of 20-25 years, the physical and chemical properties of photovoltaic panels might undergo ageing and deterioration, thereby affecting their thermal decomposition characteristics. The characteristics of samples before and after ageing were studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, elemental analyzer, and thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-mass spectrometry. There were certain differences in the weight loss temperature, time, residual mass, and activation energy of the samples in the pyrolysis reaction. After ageing, the production of acetic acid and methane in ethylene vinyl acetate pyrolysis products increased, while the production of CO2 decreased. After ageing, Tedlar-Polyethylene Terephalate-Tedlar mainly produced water, carbon dioxide, and fluorocarbon compounds, and the percentage of harmful fluorocarbon compounds in the human body increased. Cyclosiloxane, CO2, and hydrocarbons containing C-H bond were detected in each weight-loss stage of aged silica gel. As the heating rate changed, the amount of pyrolysis products also changed. Controlling the sample's heating rate would help to lessen the quantity of hazardous pollutants that were produced. The influence of ageing on the weight loss of mixed samples was discussed. This study seeks to give a fundamental understanding of the physicochemical properties, pyrolysis behaviour, and volatiles of samples before and after ageing, thus providing helpful insights for the final disposal or recovery of waste photovoltaic panels through pyrolysis.</description>

      <title>The Impact of the European Union Emissions Trading System on Carbon Dioxide Emissions: A Matrix Completion Analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4257567/v1</link>

                Abstract Despite the negative externalities on the environment and human health, today&#8217;s economies still produce excessive carbon dioxide emissions. As a result, governments are trying to shift production and consumption to more sustainable models that reduce the impact of carbon dioxide emissions. The European Union, in particular, has implemented an innovative policy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by creating a market for emission rights, the emissions trading system. The objective of this paper is to perform a counterfactual analysis to measure the impact of the emissions trading system on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. For this purpose, a recently-developed statistical machine learning method called matrix completion with fixed effects estimation is used and compared to traditional econometric techniques. We apply matrix completion with fixed effects estimation to the prediction of missing counterfactual entries of a carbon dioxide emissions matrix whose elements (indexed row-wise by country and column-wise by year) represent emissions without the emissions trading system for country-year pairs. The results obtained, confirmed by robust diagnostic tests, show a significant effect of the emissions trading system on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions: the majority of European Union countries included in our analysis reduced their total carbon dioxide emissions by about 20% during the emissions trading system treatment period 2005&#8211;2016, compared to the total carbon dioxide emissions that would have been achieved in the absence of the emissions trading system policy. Finally, several managerial/practical implications of the study are discussed, together with its possible extensions.</description>

                Abstract To achieve the Paris climate target, deep emissions reductions have to be complemented with carbon dioxide removal (CDR). However, a portfolio of CDR options is necessary to reduce risks and potential negative side effects. Despite a large theoretical potential, ocean-based CDR such as ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) has been omitted in climate change mitigation scenarios so far. In this study, we provide a techno-economic assessment of large-scale OAE using hydrated lime (&#8216;ocean liming&#8217;). We address key uncertainties that determine the overall cost of ocean liming such as the CO2 uptake efficiency per unit of material, distribution strategies avoiding carbonate precipitation which would compromise efficiency, and technology availability (e.g., solar calciners). We find that at economic costs of 130 to 295 $/tCO2 net-removed, ocean liming could be a competitive CDR option which could make a significant contribution towards the Paris climate target. As the techno-economic assessment identified no showstoppers, we argue for more research on ecosystem impacts, governance, monitoring, reporting, and verification, and technology development and assessment to determine whether ocean liming and other OAE should be considered as part of a broader CDR portfolio.&amp;#xD;</description>

      <title>Low-cost UAV Coordinated Carbon Observation Network: carbon dioxide measurement with multiple UAVs</title>

                Improving the mitigation of global greenhouse effects requires drastic reductions in carbon emissions. Effective carbon management at different spatial scales is therefore crucial to a more sustainable path of economic development. Regional and local carbon management currently rely on the traditional bottom-up method of emission reports, which are known for their opaque and complex procedures. Novel top-down carbon monitoring methods including space-based, aerial and ground-based observations are tantalising alternatives to more reliable data sources of carbon emissions as well as sinks. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based carbon monitoring is an upcoming field because of its lower costs, higher spatial-temporal resolution and operability at a wider range of weather conditions compared to satellite observations. UAVs equipped with Non-dispersive Infrared (NDIR) carbon dioxide (CO2) sensors can measure in the air with faster response and can intelligently navigate themselves within areas of greater interest. With the help of lighter NDIR payloads and multiple UAVs flying in synchrony, larger cross sections or areas for maximising information acquisition of emission plumes can be covered. In this article, we first introduce the design of a miniaturised NDIR payload, which is compatible with a lightweight UAV to achieve a single system weighing less than 4kg. Then, we test our design via comparisons against another NDIR payload to determine its accuracy (-0.82ppm and -0.44ppm) and precision (0.12ppm and -0.03ppm) in measurements of two vertical concentration profiles. Finally, we deployed four UAVs on two major anthropogenic emission source monitoring campaigns with coordinated flight patterns. To fully understand the benefit of multi-UAV carbon monitoring, we attempted two flight patterns and computed power plant emission rates via the cross-sectional flux method. While all flights successfully captured the concentration enhancements downwind of the power plants, the single-sectional flight pattern measured an emission rate of 10ktCO2/day which is 44% less than that reported monthly and the multi-sectional flight pattern yielded relatively varied results (8.5ktCO2/day on average, which is 54% less) for the respective sections due to wind underestimations, plume section undersampling and wind fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Leveraging climate and remote sensing metrics for predicting forest carbon stock using Bayesian geostatistical modelling under a projected climate warming in Zimbabwe</title>

                Climate change, driven by escalating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, poses a significant threat to forest ecosystems and the livelihoods of communities reliant on them, especially for the global south countries and regions like the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe. The 2000 land redistribution programme reduced buffer zones between ecologically sensitive forests and land reform beneficiaries near major carbon reservoirs. In light of these challenges, this study aimed to assess the potential effects of climate change on a strategically important plantation forest ecosystem in Zimbabwe's eastern highlands. Using data from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we modelled and predicted changes in forest carbon (C) stock density under different climate scenarios: current (1970&#8211;2000), SSP5&#8211;4.5, and SSP5&#8211;8.5. Employing a hierarchical Bayesian geostatistical approach, we compared the baseline scenario (1970&#8211;2000) with projected scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for 2075 to estimate changes in forest carbon stock distribution. Our results indicated a decline in carbon stock concentration under future climate scenarios, reflecting the adverse impact of greenhouse gas emissions on forest growth. We found that the projected range of forest carbon stock under the RCP8.5 scenario for 2075 is notably lower (2&#8804;MgCha&#8722;1&#8804;44.9) than that of the baseline period (1970&#8211;2000) (1&#8804;MgCha&#8722;1&#8804;97), suggesting a substantial reduction in carbon storage. As the difference in posterior mean C stock (&#956;&#773;1&#8722;&#956;&#773;2), 52.1 MgCha-1 is well above zero, we deduce that the posterior mean C stock distribution of the projected future RCP8.5 2075 climate projection is indeed credibly different from the current (1970&#8211;2000) climate scenario. Additionally, there is a high probability (&gt;90%) that forest plantations will be adversely affected by the business-as-usual climate warming projection. Overall, our findings highlight the urgent need for climate change mitigation strategies, such as reforestation programs and careful selection of tree species for plantations, to safeguard forest ecosystems and the communities dependent on them. These insights are crucial for informing effective adaptation measures in the face of future climate uncertainties.</description>

                Along with the promotion of low-carbon and zero carbon buildings such as ultra-low energy buildings, near zero energy buildings, and zero energy buildings, there is higher and higher demand to the thermal performance of building envelopes. Thermal bridges have a crucial impact on the thermal performance of building envelope structures. In order to achieve the goal of energy conservation and carbon dioxide reduction in building structures, it is necessary to conduct refined calculations and evaluations on thermal bridge treatment measures. In this paper, three thermal bridge treatment measures evaluation methods from different dimensions are presented: evaluation method based on reduction degree of thermal bridge effect, evaluation method based on carbon dioxide emissions from thermal bridges, and evaluation method based on technical economy of thermal bridges.</description>

                In this modern era, motor vehicles have brought significant changes in human life. Faster and more efficient mobility has increased connectivity between regions, supported economic growth, and improved quality of life. However, increased mobility also means an increase in vehicle exhaust emissions, which contribute to climate change and air pollution. One effective technology for controlling exhaust emissions is the use of catalytic converters. Metal catalytic converters, such as copper, brass, and chrome-plated copper, have been researched as more affordable and effective catalyst alternatives. This research aims to analyze the optimal design of exhaust systems with catalytic converters among three types of alternative materials (copper, brass, and chrome-plated copper) as well as standard exhaust systems without catalysts (STD NC) and standard platinum group metal exhaust systems (STD PGM) in maximizing the reduction of motor vehicle exhaust emissions. An experimental research design was used by utilizing a 2015 Yamaha Vixion Lightning as the research object. Catalytic converters were prepared with specific specifications to ensure consistency and accuracy in measurements. CO (carbon monoxide), HC (hydrocarbons), CO2 (carbon dioxide), and O2 (oxygen) emissions were analyzed using an Exhaust Gas Analyzer. The research results indicate that the CuCr sample exhibits excellent performance in reducing CO and HC emissions. The CuCr sample has an average CO emission of 4.09% Vol with a standard deviation of 1.46, demonstrating good consistency in CO emissions. Meanwhile, the average HC emissions from the CuCr sample are 320 ppmVol with a standard deviation of 106, indicating good consistency in HC emissions. All samples meet the emission standards set by the government, except for the STD NC sample, which exceeds the CO emission threshold.</description>

      <title>Can reducing carbon emissions improve economic performance &#8211; evidence from China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.7910/dvn/sh8hrt</link>
      <description>Fei Yang, Beibei Shi, Ming Xu, Chen Feng, Harvard Dataverse. None(None)] 2019. https://openalex.org/W4399012229

                As the problem of carbon emissions is becoming increasingly more serious around the world, how to balance carbon emissions reduction and economic growth has become an important issue in the field of environmental economics. China is the world's largest carbon dioxide emitter, and China's Low-Carbon Pilot (CLCP) policy has significantly reduced carbon dioxide emissions and achieved expected benefits. However, is environmental quality improving at the expense of economic growth? This article selects macro panel data of 286 Chinese prefecture-level cities and micro data of Chinese industrial enterprises from 2001 to 2013, takes the CLCP policy implementation by five provinces and eight cities as a quasi-natural experiment, uses difference-in-differences (DID) method to investigate the causal effect of CLCP policy on regional economic growth and enterprise behavior. The results are as follows. First, the CLCP policy significantly promotes regional economic growth. Moreover, as the implementation time of the policy continues, environmental regulation has a greater effect of promoting economic growth. Second, although the CLCP policy significantly increases various production costs, it also promotes the growth of enterprises' output and benefits. Third, under the pressure of enterprise cost increase caused by environmental regulation, enterprises choose the positive way of strengthening internal management, improving efficiency and increasing innovation instead of choosing the negative way of trans-regional transfer, and finally achieve an improvement in output and benefits.</description>

      <title>Research on the Measurement of the Relationship between Carbon Emissions and Economic Development in China&#8212;&#8212;Based on the Tapio Decoupling theory and the Environmental Kuznets Theory Analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202452803011</link>
      <description>Yuxin Chen, Yan Wang, E3S web of conferences. 528(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399072340

                In this paper, based on the panel data of China's carbon dioxide emissions, economic and energy development from 2000 to 2022, per capita GDP and carbon emissions are used as analysis indicators.The environmental Kuznets theory serves as the basis for an analysis of the correlation between economic progress and carbon dioxide emissions.The findings indicate that China's GDP and carbon emissions increased between 2000 and 2022. From 7,912 yuan in 2000 to 85,698 yuan in 2022, the per capita GDP grew by over ten times. Although per capita carbon emissions generally increased, they declined between 2014 and 2017, It might be connected to the nation's strong initiatives to support green development and the restructuring of the energy structure.For specific explanations,please refer to 4.1 Temporal evolution characteristics of carbon emissions and GDP . China is still in a transitional phase when it comes to environmental preservation and economic development, as seen by the N-shaped curve connecting the country's carbon dioxide emissions and economic growth rate. Based on this theory, the Tapio decoupling theory provides an understanding of the decoupling relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth based on carbon accounting. The irrational use of coal, oil, natural gas and other fossil fuels as the main energy has caused a series of environmental problems and seriously restricted economic development. Therefore, Stronger innovation and promotion of low-carbon and green technologies are required, as is the reduction of carbon emissions from the industrial structure and method of economic progress.</description>

                Based on panel data for 30 provinces in China from 2000 to 2020, this paper uses entropy method to construct the integrated development indicators of energy Internet, and explores the impact of the development of the energy Internet on reducing carbon emissions in China and its internal transmission mechanism. The research results show that the development of energy Internet can significantly reduce regional carbon dioxide emissions, and increasing the use of renewable energy is an important mechanism for the comprehensive development of energy Internet to curb carbon emissions. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the emission reduction effect brought by the development of energy Internet is more remarkable in the regions with lower carbon emissions and western China. Furthermore, this paper finds that in the setting of the development of energy Internet, the development of renewable energy can promote natural gas consumption and advance energy conversion efficiency. The government&#8217;s emphasis on regional technology development has an external strengthening effect on carbon emission reduction. The research in this paper expands and diversifies carbon reduction pathways and provides reference for more developing countries to utilize the development of energy internet to achieve carbon reduction.</description>

                Calcium looping carbon capture was simulated for a steel plant and three fuel cases were studied: coal, coke, and half coal/coke. The steelmaking production was about 1.2 t of liquid steel per hour at &gt;99.85% purity by weight. This study evaluated the effect of carbon capture efficiency and raw material cost on the lime flow rate in the calcium looping section. Increasing the lime feeding flow rate achieved higher efficiency but at a higher cost. The overall captured efficiency was higher than the flue gas captured efficiency at a low lime feeding flow rate but lower at a high lime feeding flow rate. Then, the overall captured efficiency tended to decrease at high lime feeding flow rate because raw materials were used too much for carbon capture and caused overall carbon dioxide emission more than the content of captured carbon dioxide in the product stream. Coal as fuel plays an important role in carbon emission reduction as one of the raw materials, along with the utility cost and the raw material cost in calcium looping section.</description>

      <title>Deep Weighted Fusion Learning (DWFL)-based multi-sensor fusion model for accurate building occupancy detection</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyai.2024.100379</link>

                With the advancement of artificial intelligence, the dominance of deep learning (DL) models over ordinary machine learning (ML) algorithms has become a reality in recent years due to its capability of handling complex pattern recognition without manual feature pre-definition. With the growing demands for power savings, building energy loss reduction could benefit from DL techniques. For buildings/rooms with the varying number of occupants, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are often found in operations without much necessity. To reduce the building's energy loss, accurate occupancy detection/prediction (ODP) results could be used to control the proper operations of HVACs. However, ODP is a challenging issue due to multiple reasons, such as improper selection/deployment of sensors, inefficient learning algorithms for pattern recognition, varying room conditions, etc. To overcome the above challenges, we propose a DL-based framework, i.e., Deep Weighted Fusion Learning (DWFL), to detect and predict occupancy counts with optimal multi-sensor fusion structure. DWFL fuses the extracted features from multiple types of sensors with the priority/weight assignment to each sensor. Such weight assignment considers different room conditions and the pros/cons of each type of sensor. To evaluate DWFL model in terms of occupancy prediction accuracy, we have set up an experimental testbed with low-cost cameras, carbon dioxide (CO2), and passive infrared (PIR) sensors. Among the recently proposed occupancy detection models, DeepFusion utilized deep learning model on heterogeneous sensor data and achieved 88% accuracy in occupancy count estimation (Xue et al., 2019). Another deep learning-based model MI-PIR achieved 91% accuracy on raw analog data from PIR sensors (Andrews et al., 2020). Our research outcome is 94%. Therefore, the experiment results show that our DWFL scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art ODP methods by 3%.</description>

                This study delved into the integration of biomass gas and natural gas within a Combined Cooling, Heating, and Power (CCHP) system. A Semi-Isolated Green Energy CCHP (SIGE-CCHP) model was devised to scrutinize the performance of co-firing equipment across diverse optimization objectives, while manipulating the proportions of natural gas and biomass gas as inputs. Findings revealed that escalating the share of biomass gas led to a reduction in carbon emissions but triggered an escalation in operational and maintenance costs. However, at an optimal mixing ratio of 1:1, carbon emissions exhibited marginal increments, coupled with a substantial decrease in operational and maintenance expenses. Notably, when prioritizing operational and maintenance costs, the system exhibited optimal performance, resulting in a notable 26.76% cost reduction. Conversely, when prioritizing carbon emissions, the system metamorphosed into a carbon sequestration entity, with a maximal capacity to absorb 2021.86kg of carbon dioxide. This study furnishes theoretical underpinnings for optimizing the operation of co-firing equipment, augmented by a sensitivity analysis aimed at intuitively elucidating the repercussions of varying mixing ratios on the system.</description>

                The proliferation of e-bus has swept the globe. Many countries have begun the transformation of electric buses. Electric buses are embraced worldwide for their environmental and low-cost advantages. This work will help local governments establish a complete e-bus system.The first question mainly addresses the ecological impact that would be brought by the impact. In this work, the Ecological Impact Quantification Model (EIQM) is developed to address gaseous pollution including Greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, pollutants nitric oxide and PM2.5. The ecological effect enhancement with e-bus system is presented, and especially, the gaseous pollution caused by electricity production is approximated by the Monte Carlo simulation method. As a result, this team figures out that with the development of e-bus system, the average CO2 emission per person decreases, having a reduction of 11391g at first, and 14039g after five years.The second question mainly addresses the financial problem that the government needs to face. In this work, the Quantification of Financial Impact Model (QFIM) is developed. This team utilizes the differential equation to obtain the exact varying rate of diesel fuel and electricity fee, and finally determined the possible range of the government deficit. By synthesizing these data, this team discovers that the government could start reducing its deficit after 8 years of the transformation from diesel bus to e-bus, having deficit from $-88,412,180 to $-64,182,722.The third question addresses the 10-year plan for the selected city and 2 additional cities. This team develops Optimized Deployment Model based on Greedy Algorithm (ODGA) to optimize the transformation plan over 10 years of existing bus routes and the number of e-bus to be constructed per year. Monetary and time utility is considered and Greedy Algorithm is introduced to find out the best travelling route for e-buses. This team successfully figures out the best transformation plan of travelling routes and number of e-bus to be constructed per year to maximize the efficiency, including 5-min interval departure time and 867 buses are required to run the proposed route in Chicago. Finally, the team writes a piece of letter to Chicago Transit Authority and proposes the 10-year plan of e-bus system construction to guarantee the steady implementation of e-bus.</description>

                In order to expand the utilisation of CO2 as a resource in the metallurgical industry, it is proposed to inject CO2 into the tuyere of blast furnace. CO2 reacts completely at the tuyere raceway zone, increasing the CO concentration of the gas, affects the reduction process. Therefore, the influence of injecting CO2 into the tuyere on the reduction process of the burden layer is analysed through a series of experiments. The results indicate that when the CO2 injection rate increases to 4%, the improvement of the permeability is most significant, which is due to the increase of the metal phase dispersion in the burden layer. The influence of injecting CO2 on the burden layer distribution mainly comes from the influence of the experimental atmosphere on the reduction degree. With the increase of the CO2 injection rate, the low temperature reduction pulverisation behavior of burden layer changes less.</description>

                A nanocomposite of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) decorated with molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) nanoparticles is fabricated through the reduction of phosphomolybdic acid hydrate on functionalized MWCNTs in a hydrogen&#8211;argon (10%) atmosphere in a tube furnace. The MoO2/MWCNTs composite is proposed as an anodic modification material for microbial fuel cells (MFCs). MWCNTs have outstanding physical and chemical peculiarities, with functionalized MWCNTs having substantially large electroactive areas. In addition, combined with the exceptional properties of MoO2 nanoparticles, the synergistic advantages of functionalized MWCNTs and MoO2 nanoparticles give a MoO2/MWCNTs anode a large electroactive area, excellent electronic conductivity, enhanced extracellular electron transfer capacity, and improved nutrient transfer capability. Finally, the power harvesting of an MFC with the MoO2/MWCNTs anode is improved, with the MFC showing long-term repeatability of voltage and current density outputs. This exploratory research advances the fundamental application of anodic modification to MFCs, simultaneously providing valuable guidance for the use of carbon-based transition metal oxide nanomaterials in high-performance MFCs.</description>

      <title>Carbon Farming: a Systematic Literature Review on Sustainable Practices</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.7250/conect.2024.063</link>
      <description>Lelde Vistarte, Anna Kubule, Je&#316;ena Pubule, CONECT. International Scientific Conference of Environmental and Climate Technologies. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399067686

                The European Union (EU) aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030. As the goal for 2030 is already set and now it is challenging to reach a 55% reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the goals will become more challenging as the EU plans to reach climate neutrality by 2050. As the EU&#8217;s Climate goals become more ambitious the countries have to adapt and find more potential ways to decrease GHG emissions in all sectors. One of the biggest contributors to GHG in the EU is the agricultural sector. One of the potential ways to reduce GHG emissions in the agricultural sector is carbon farming. Carbon farming is a sustainable agricultural approach designed to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and mitigate climate change. By employing regenerative practices, carbon farming enhances soil health, promotes biodiversity, and reduces GHG emissions. Carbon farming emerges as a key player in the global effort to combat climate change. The integration of carbon farming practices into agriculture not only can ensure sustainable food production but also underscore the critical role agriculture can play in sequestering carbon and building resilience against the challenges posed by a changing climate. Even though carbon farming has the potential to decrease GHG emissions from the agricultural sector and sequester carbon, there are still knowledge gaps on how to assess carbon farming practices and their potential carbon sequestration, as well as which practices the farmers could use to gain the best possible outcome based on the carbon practice feasibility and sustainability. The study aims to develop a systematic literature review that assesses the main carbon farming practices and their potential to help reach climate goals and contribute to climate change mitigation.</description>

                Abstract Copper (Cu) nanomaterials are a unique kind of electrocatalysts for high&#8208;value multi&#8208;carbon production in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), which holds enormous potential in attaining carbon neutrality. However, phase engineering of Cu nanomaterials remains challenging, especially for the construction of unconventional phase Cu&#8208;based asymmetric heteronanostructures. Here we report the site&#8208;selective growth of Cu on unusual phase gold (Au) nanorods, obtaining three kinds of heterophase fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8208;Cu heteronanostructures. Significantly, the resultant fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8208;Cu Janus nanostructures (JNSs) break the symmetric growth mode of Cu on Au. In electrocatalytic CO 2 RR, the fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8208;Cu JNSs exhibit excellent performance in both H&#8208;type and flow cells, with Faradaic efficiencies of 55.5% and 84.3% for ethylene and multi&#8208;carbon products, respectively. In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal the co&#8208;exposure of 2H&#8208;Au and 2H&#8208;Cu domains in Au&#8208;Cu JNSs diversifies the CO* adsorption configurations and promotes the CO* spillover and subsequent C&#8208;C coupling towards ethylene generation with reduced energy barriers.

      <title>A hybrid artificial intelligence approach for modeling the carbonation depth of sustainable concrete containing fly ash</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-62737-1</link>
      <description>Ramin Kazemi, Scientific reports. 14(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399020152

                Abstract One of the major challenges in the civil engineering sector is the durability of reinforced concrete structures against carbonation during the physico-chemical process of interaction of hydrated cementitious composites with carbon dioxide. This aggressive process causes carbon penetration into the reinforcement part, which affects the behavior of the structure during its lifetime due to corrosion risk. A countermeasure is using alternative cementitious materials to improve concrete texture and resist increased carbonation depth (CD). Considering that the CD test requires a long time and a skilled technician, this study strives to provide an alternative approach by moving from traditional laboratory-based methods towards artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for modeling the CD of sustainable concrete containing fly ash (CCFA). Despite the development of single AI models so far, it is undeniable that utilizing metaheuristic optimization techniques in the form of hybrid models can improve their performance. To this end, a new hybrid model from the integration of biogeography-based optimization (BBO) technique with artificial neural network (ANN) is developed for the first time to estimate the CD of CCFA. The error distribution results revealed that 59% of the ANN predictions had errors within the range of (&#8722; 1 mm, 1 mm], while the corresponding percentage for the ANN-BBO predictions was 70%, indicating an 11% reduction in the prediction errors by the proposed hybrid model. Furthermore, A10-index highlighted a performance improvement of 78% for the hybrid model, which met the closeness of the predicted values to the observed ones, so that the value of this index for models of ANN and ANN-BBO was 0.5019 and 0.8947, respectively. Analyzing the cross-validation confirmed the reliability and generalizability of the developed model. Also, the three most influential variables in estimating the CD were exposure time (27%), carbon dioxide concentration (22%), and water/binder (18%), respectively. Finally, the superiority of the ANN-BBO model was verified by comparing it with previous studies&#8217; models.</description>

                Abstract In theory, market-based regulatory instruments correct market failures at least cost. However, evidence on their efficacy remains scarce. Using administrative data, we estimate that, on average, the EU ETS &#8211; the world's first and largest market-based climate policy &#8211; induced regulated manufacturing firms to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 14-16% with no detectable contractions in economic activity. We find no evidence of outsourcing to unregulated firms or markets; instead, firms made targeted investments, reducing the emissions intensity of production. These results indicate that the EU ETS induced global emissions reductions, a necessary and sufficient condition for mitigating climate change. We show that the absence of any negative economic effects can be rationalized in a model where pricing the externality induces firms to make fixed-cost investments in energy-saving capital that reduce marginal variable costs.</description>

                The way in which countries meet their United Nations Paris Agreement obligations, for CO2 reduction, depends on their energy usage and the nature of their electricity grid. As a case study, the focus is on the UK's energy usage and electricity grid. Twelve percent of the UK's CO2 emissions are from passenger cars, and substantial reductions in CO2 emissions result from moving to electrified vehicles. CO2 emissions are also reduced by increased public transportation and/or use of bicycles. CO2 emissions associated with lubrication of vehicles are negligible compared to the CO2 emissions associated with the energy needed to move the vehicles. Hurdles for UK customers moving to fully electric vehicles include price and charging infrastructure, so some customers are choosing hybrid electric vehicles, where there is both a battery and an engine. Some tribological issues associated with these hybrid electric vehicles are discussed in more detail.</description>

      <title>Simulation Study on Static Sealing Performance of Packer&#8217;s Rubber Cylinder in SC-CO2 Environment</title>

                This study aimed to solve the problems of sealing and tearing failure of packer&#8217;s rubber cylinders during CO2 downhole injection. Using the simulation software, Comsol, a rubber cylinder model in a supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) environment was established. The thermal analogy method was used to simulate the CO2 diffusion and rubber cylinder swelling process, thus we analyzed the deformation and stress of the rubber cylinder caused by temperature, pressure and CO2 as swelling agent. Results showed that, in the SC-CO2 environment, under the influence of CO2 diffusion and the consequent swelling, the rubber cylinder body is prone to large deformation, and the maximum shear stress is significantly increased, leading to shear failure of the rubber cylinder. The reduction of the initial seating pressure can alleviate the impact of deformation, whereas the reduction of the maximum contact pressure could cause the rubber cylinder to lose its seal. We also analyzed the change rules between various factors and the maximum contact pressure of the rubber cylinder, which provides a theoretical basis and technical support for improving the sealing performance of the packer&#8217;s rubber cylinder in the SC-CO2 environment.</description>

                The O 2 -CO 2 -CaO process, which blows the lime powder from the bottom, offers significant advantages in terms of reducing the consumption of raw and auxiliary materials while improving steel quality. This study examines the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions associated with four different converter smelting processes, using industrial test production data from nearly 1000 furnaces in a steel plant. This is the first comprehensive analysis of CO 2 emissions for these processes and quantifies the CO 2 emissions reduction potential of the bottom-blowing O 2 -CO 2 -CaO process. The study shows a significant difference in CO 2 emissions between the duplex and conventional smelting processes, with the former exhibiting significantly higher emissions. The application of bottom-blowing O 2 -CO 2 -CaO process led to a decrease of 24.6 kgCO 2 /t in the duplex converter smelting process and 30.1 kgCO 2 /t in the conventional smelting process.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic Model of District Heating Energy Hub: The Case of Latvia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.7250/conect.2024.017</link>
      <description>Emils Zarins, Madara Rieksta, Gatis Ba&#382;bauers, CONECT. International Scientific Conference of Environmental and Climate Technologies. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399067529

                Up to 60% of Latvia&#8217;s energy resources are used as fuel for district heating systems. Heating sector is an important emitter of greenhouse gases &#8211; especially carbon dioxide. Therefore, reduction of carbon emissions of district heating systems are crucial in Latvia&#8217;s decarbonization efforts. One of the solutions is integration of energy hub in the district heating network. There are many types of energy hubs, and the most suitable solution must be found in each case. A goal of this study is to find the best solution for Latvia&#8217;s district heating systems to achieve decarbonization and use of green (renewable) hydrogen. This coincides with European Union&#8217;s plans to increase the use of green hydrogen not only in industrial and residential application, but in heat production as well.To facilitate the plans of the European Union and Latvia&#8217;s decarbonization needs a mathematical model made in Microsoft Excel is used as a method to explore the techno-economic aspects of the energy hub and its integration in the district heating system. Several alternatives are considered, and green hydrogen is used in all of those. Results show the economically most feasible alternative. Calculations are made on an annual term basis, considering such factors as electricity and district heating price, required capacity of electrolysis apparatus for hydrogen production etc.From the model some results are apparent &#8211; the price of electricity has a sizable impact on the economic feasibility of the project, and the best use for green hydrogen economics-wise may differ throughout the year as the price of electricity, hydrogen, district heating and methane gas change.</description>

                Abstract Background Catalyst synthesis plays a crucial role in advancing photo and electrocatalysis technologies for sustainable development. However, the traditional thermal radiation heating method suffers from the disadvantages of high energy consumption, low heat transfer efficiency, slow heating speed and long heating time, which leads to the inefficiency and cost increases in catalyst preparation. Aims The Joule&#8208;heating ultrafast synthesis method with rapid heating/quenching and shorter heating time has attracted much attention. Despite its potential, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews specifically addressing the synthesis of advanced photo and electrocatalysts via Joule&#8208;heating. Therefore, this review aims to help people quickly understand the advantages of Joule&#8208;heating in the synthesis of photo and electrocatalysts. Discussion Herein, we firstly introduce the principles and devices of Joule&#8208;heating, and then we discuss breakthroughs in defect modulation, heterojunction construction, single&#8208;atom catalysts, bimetallic alloy catalysts, high&#8208;entropy alloy catalysts and metastable catalysts achieved through Joule&#8208;heating technology. The diverse applications of these catalysts include hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction reactions, carbon dioxide reduction reactions, nitrogen reduction reaction and degradation of organic pollutants. Furthermore, this review provides a forward&#8208;looking perspective on future directions for employing Joule&#8208;heating methods in the field of photo and electrocatalysis research. Conclusion This review highlights the pivotal role played by Joule&#8208;heating techniques in advancing nanomaterial synthesis as well as developing sustainable high&#8208;performance catalyst systems.</description>

      <title>Observed regional impacts of marine heatwaves on air-sea CO2 exchange</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.171707892.29222066/v1</link>

                Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have devastating effects on ecosystems and impact regional air-sea CO2 exchange. Yet a global assessment of these regional impacts of MHWs on the air-sea CO2 exchange is missing. Here, we analyze thirty global observation-based air-sea CO2 flux datasets from 1990 to 2019. We observe minimal reduction in global oceanic CO2 uptake during MHWs. Regional variations are evident with the equatorial Pacific experiencing a 31% (spread across datasets: 3-49%) reduction in carbon release, suggesting that MHWs are the dominant drivers of strong air-sea CO2 flux anomalies in this region. In low-to-mid latitudes, MHWs cause a 29% (19-37%) decrease in air-sea CO2 uptake. Reduced dissolved inorganic carbon in the tropics weakens outgassing, while high ocean temperatures diminish uptake in the low-to-mid latitudes. In the North Pacific and Southern Ocean, enhanced carbon uptake occurs during MHWs, but uncertainties in pCO2 datasets limit a comprehensive assessment in these regions.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Framework for Multistep Carbon Emission Prediction: An Improved Bi-LSTM Model Based on the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm and Two-Stage Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4406983/v1</link>

                Abstract Effective prediction of carbon dioxide emissions is crucial for the real-time monitoring of carbon emission dynamics and the formulation of emission reduction policies. For the accurate and stable prediction of carbon emission data, multiple challenges must be addressed, mainly including nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and dynamic uncertainty. To further improve the accuracy of carbon emission prediction, an ensemble framework for daily CO&#8322; emission forecasting based on data decomposition-reconstruction is proposed. First, the original data are decomposed into trend, seasonal, and residual components using seasonal trend decomposition via the Loess method. For the trend and seasonal components, the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) is applied to optimize a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network for further prediction. The Bi-LSTM adopts a novel LeakyReLU activation function to effectively extract data features, thereby enhancing the model's expressive power. Meanwhile, the Nadam optimizer is employed, which combines the adaptive learning rate mechanism of the Adam algorithm with the Nesterov momentum to update weights and biases, enabling efficient model training, accelerating convergence, and improving model performance. Then, the residual component is decomposed again using gray wolf optimizer (GWO)-optimized variational mode decomposition (VMD), VMD incorporates a quadratic penalty function and Lagrange multipliers to derive the input series. and the decomposed subsequences are predicted using gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks. Finally, the predictions of each subsequence are stacked and reconstructed to obtain the final forecast value, creating an ensemble framework referred to as STL-BOA-Bi-LSTM-GWO-VMD-GRU. The proposed ensemble framework is tested on real data from seven different regions. In both single-step and multistep prediction processes, the proposed ensemble framework has higher prediction accuracy and stability than other models, demonstrating significant advantages.</description>

      <title>Research on the whole life cycle energy consumption and pollution emission of new energy vehicles and traditional fuel vehicles based on the perspective of single vehicle currency of the same vehicle model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202452803018</link>
      <description>Yong Zhu, E3S web of conferences. 528(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399072289

                To construct an evaluation framework based on whole-life energy consumption and pollution emissions, the control variable method is used when selecting vehicles for comparison. By assessing a new energy vehicle (the Audi Q2L e-tron) and a traditional fuel vehicle (the Audi Q2L) of the same model, differences in emission and energy consumption are solely attributed to power forms. Results are monetized to facilitate analysis of the societal benefits of new energy vehicles, reflecting environmental impact in monetary terms. The results of the paper show that although the replacement of traditional fuel vehicles by new energy vehicles can achieve carbon emission reduction and considerable energy savings in the energy cycle, due to the fact that new energy vehicles produce more sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ) in the production phase, the full replacement of traditional fuel vehicles by electric vehicles at this stage will not be able to achieve an improvement in the overall welfare of the society. Therefore, under the current conditions, the improvement of new energy vehicles should start with finding cleaner and more environmentally friendly ways in the manufacturing stage of automobiles, as well as modifying the way of producing electricity.</description>

      <title>Governance of carbon dioxide removal (CDR): an AI-enhanced systematic map of the scientific literature</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4484969/v1</link>
      <description>Sarah L&#252;ck, Anna Mohn, William F. Lamb, Research Square (Research Square). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399138238

                Abstract For limiting global warming to well below 2&#176;C rapid and stringent GHG emissions reductions are required. In addition, we also need to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere via carbon dioxide removal (CDR). This will require advances in policymaking and governance to incentivise, coordinate and regulate CDR, including strict monitoring to ensure durable, additional removals that do not compete with emission reduction efforts. While it is critical to learn from the existing evidence on CDR policy and governance, there is no overview of this dispersed body of literature right now. IPCC and other science assessments have therefore treated the subject very selectively. This work addresses this lack of overview by systematically mapping the literature assessing policy and governance dimensions of CDR. Systematic mapping provides a comprehensive view of a research field by analysing the state of evidence, i.e. how much research is available at any point in time on which topics and geographies studied by whom, when and where. We use an AI-enhanced approach to systematic mapping, trimming down an initial set of about 30,000 documents on CDR to a set of 876 that deal with governance and policy issues. Our findings show sharply growing attention to CDR policies and governance issues over time, but with limited coverage of the Global South. Long established conventional CDR methods such as afforestation dominate the literature - particularly in ex-post studies - with little coverage of many novel CDR methods, such as biochar or direct air carbon capture and storage. We observe a shift from an initial discussion on CDR in international agreements towards the planning and implementation phase of national and sub-national policies. Our map can help to inform upcoming science assessments with critical information around CDR policies and governance and might serve as a starting point for generating a rigorous knowledge base on the topic in the future.</description>

      <title>Quantifying air quality co-benefits to industrial decarbonization: the local Air Emissions Tracking Atlas</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2024.1394678</link>

                Introduction Many decarbonization technologies have the added co-benefit of reducing short-lived climate pollutants, such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), creating a unique opportunity for identifying strategies that promote both climate change solutions and opportunities for air quality improvement. However, stakeholders and decision-makers may struggle to quantify how these co-benefits will impact public health for the communities most affected by industrial air pollution. Methods To address this problem, the LOCal Air Emissions Tracking Atlas ( LOCAETA ) fills a data availability and analysis gap by providing estimated air quality benefits from industrial decarbonization options, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). These co-benefits are calculated using an algorithm that connects disparate datasets that separately report greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants at U.S. industrial facilities. Results Version 1.0 of LOCAETA displays the estimated primary PM 2.5 emission reduction co-benefits from additional pretreatment equipment for CCS on industrial and power facilities across the state of Louisiana, as well as the potential for VOC and NH 3 generation. The emission reductions are presented in the tool alongside facility pollutant emissions information and relevant air quality, environmental, demographic, and public health datasets, such as air toxics cancer risk, satellite and in situ pollutant measurements, and population vulnerability metrics. Discussion LOCAETA enables regulators, policymakers, environmental justice communities, and industrial and commercial users to compare and contrast quantifiable public health benefits due to air quality impacts from various climate change mitigation strategies using a free and publicly-available tool. Additional pollutant reductions can be calculated using the same methodology and will be available in future versions of the tool.</description>

      <title>Waste-Heat Renewable Gasifier Design through Taguchi's Method and MANFIS</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.7250/conect.2024.042</link>
      <description>Chung-Neng Huang, Yu&#8208;Shu Yen, CONECT. International Scientific Conference of Environmental and Climate Technologies. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399067525

                Ensuring a global average temperature increase of no more than 1.5&#176;C is crucial for aligning with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that a 45% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or a 25% reduction by the same year is necessary to cap the temperature rise at 2&#176;C. Failure to achieve this target by 2030 would necessitate substantial subsequent reductions to compensate for the delayed progress toward net zero emissions, potentially incurring higher costs. Elevating the focus on enhancing energy efficiency has emerged as a key strategy in expediting progress toward these climate goals. Hydrogen, renowned for its high efficiency and emission-free combustion, is anticipated to play a pivotal role in this endeavor. Traditionally, gasifiers have served as the conduit for transforming inexpensive fuels like coal or biomass into hydrogen. However, their energy-intensive nature poses a challenge.Addressing this inherent issue, an innovative approach known as the external-heating gasifier has been proposed and designed. The design of the external-heating gasifier represents a quintessential nonlinear and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) problem. To achieve optimal performance, the integration of Taguchi's method and inverse-model technology has been employed, with a simulation platform developed using the COMSOL Multiphysics software.Initially, Taguchi's method was utilized to determine the minimum number of experiments required for a full-factorial design and identify the most critical factors influencing product performance. Subsequently, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was developed with a MIMO&#8211;ANFIS architecture. This system was employed to train an inverse model, facilitating the mapping of relationships between each input and output set. In essence, this approach enables the identification of manufacturing parameters that result in optimal performance. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method, a simulation study on an existing gasifier is presented.</description>

      <title>Strategic Innovation and Performance of Hydrogen Fuel Consumption in Kenya</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.36349/easjebm.2024.v07i05.006</link>
      <description>Richard Mbalya, Justice Mutua, East African scholars journal of economics, business and management. 7(05)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399160436

                The utilization of hydrogen fuel represents a global shift towards sustainable energy sources, yielding significant reductions in carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the abundance of renewable energy options, widespread adoption has been slow, with persistent reliance on fossil fuels. The purpose of this study was to establish the effect of strategic innovation on the performance of hydrogen fuel consumption in Kenya. The proposed objectives of this study were: to determine the effect of product innovation on the performance of hydrogen fuel consumption in Kenya, and to assess the influence of process innovation on the performance of hydrogen fuel consumption in Kenya. Employing a desktop research methodology, the study emphasizes the pivotal role of strategic innovations in fostering sustainability, product and process innovation in hydrogen fuel consumption and the renewable energy sector. This study concludes that strategic innovations, including product innovation and process innovation have a positive effect on the performance of hydrogen fuel consumption in Kenya. Further, robust policy frameworks are essential to incentivize and facilitate innovation in hydrogen fuel production. The study recommends that the Kenyan government prioritize policy formulation to stimulate hydrogen generation and utilization, integrating incentives for research and development, tax exemptions, and financial support to encourage private investment and domestic industry growth, thus reducing reliance on imports and fostering economic diversification.</description>

                This paper examines the technical and economic influence of CO2 reduction measures on the design and operation of Dutch beam trawlers. This is done by means of a parametric model used to assess the influence on the overall design of the vessel. Technical feasibility is determined by meeting operational effectiveness requirements, maximum added draught, maximum added length, and a reduction of CO2 emission by at least 40%. Secondly the model evaluates the new energy carrier and fish storage layout as a result of additional required volume. Additional volume is gained within the net store, fish hold, or by hull extension. Additionally, various propeller configurations, waste heat recovery, and regenerative braking systems are explored to reduce energy consumption. The economic performance is assessed using yearly operational requirements, capital expenses of configuration, and total cost of ownership.</description>

                The transportation sector plays a pivotal role in China&#8217;s efforts to achieve CO2 reduction targets. As the capital of China, Beijing has the responsibility to lead the era&#8217;s demand for low-carbon development and provide replicable and scalable low-carbon transportation development experience and knowledge for other cities in China. This study calculates the CO2 emissions of the transportation sector in Beijing from 1999 to 2019, constructs an extended STIRPAT model (population, affluence, technology, and efficiency), employs ridge regression to mitigate the effects of multicollinearity among the eight indicators, reveals the extent and direction of influence exerted by different indicators on CO2 emissions, and predicts the development trends, peak times, and quantities of transportation CO2 emissions in nine scenarios for Beijing from 2021 to 2035. Finally, adaptive low-carbon planning strategies are proposed for Beijing pertaining to population size and structure, industrial layout optimization, urban functional reorganization and adjustment, transportation infrastructure allocation, technological research and promotion, energy transition planning, and regional collaborative development. The results are as follows: (1) The total amount of CO2 emissions from Beijing&#8217;s transportation sector exhibits a trend of gradually stabilizing in terms of growth, with a corresponding gradual deceleration in the rate of increase. Kerosene, gasoline, and diesel are the main sources of transportation CO2 emissions in Beijing, with an annual average proportion of 95.78%. (2) The degree of influence of the indicators on transportation CO2 emissions, in descending order, is energy intensity, per capita GDP, population size, GDP by transportation sector, total transportation turnover, public transportation efficiency, possession of private vehicles, and clean energy structure. Among them, the proportion of clean energy structure and public transportation efficiency are negatively correlated with transportation CO2 emissions, while the remaining indicators are positively correlated. (3) In the nine predicted scenarios, all scenarios, except scenario 2 and scenario 4, can achieve CO2 emission peaks by 2030, while scenarios 7 and 9 can reach the peak as early as 2025. (4) The significant advancement and application of green carbon reduction technologies have profound implications, as they can effectively offset the impacts of population, economy, and efficiency indicators under extensive development. Effective population control, sustainable economic development, and transportation efficiency improvement are viable means to help achieve carbon peaking and peak value in the transportation sector.</description>

      <title>Mechanical, Durability, and Microstructure Assessment of Wastepaper Fiber-Reinforced Concrete Containing Metakaolin</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17112608</link>
      <description>Mohammad Valizadeh Kiamahalleh, Aliakbar Gholampour, Mohsen Rezaei Shahmirzadi, Tuan Ngo, Togay Ozbakkaloglu, Materials. 17(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399074461

                This study evaluates the potential use of discarded plasterboard paper as fibers from buildings to reinforce concrete. Various concentrations of wastepaper fibers (0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, and 2.5% by weight of the binder) were investigated in this research. To mitigate the water absorption effect of the paper fibers, metakaolin was employed as a partial cement replacement. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of the wastepaper fiber enhances the mechanical and durability performance of the concrete. The optimal fiber proportion was identified as 1%, leading to a 29% increase in the compressive strength, a 38% increase in the splitting tensile strength, a 12% decrease in the water absorption, and a 23% decrease in the drying shrinkage with respect to the concrete containing 20% metakaolin. However, exceeding this optimal fiber content results in decreased mechanical and durability properties due to the fiber agglomeration and non-uniform fiber distribution within the concrete matrix. Based on the microstructural analysis, the improved performance of the concrete is ascribed to decreased porosity, more refined pore structure, and reduced propagation of microcracks within the concrete matrix in the presence of wastepaper fiber. According to the results, concrete containing 20% metakaolin and 1% wastepaper fiber exhibits durability and mechanical properties comparable to those of the traditional concrete. This finding highlights the significant promise of reducing dependency on conventional cement and incorporating suitable recycled materials, such as discarded plasterboard, and secondary by-products like metakaolin. Such a strategy encourages the preservation of resources, reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and a decrease in the ecological footprint resulting from concrete production.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Sustainable Practices for Managing Residue Derived from Wheat Straw</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering11060554</link>
      <description>Harikishore Shanmugam, G.S.V. Raghavan, Rajinikanth Rajagopal, Bernard Goyette, Linxiang Lyu, Siyuan Zhou, Chunjiang An, Bioengineering. 11(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399174108

                Farm leftovers, particularly crop residues, are a key source of renewable energy in Canada. The nation&#8217;s robust agricultural industry provides ample biomass, derived from forestry and agriculture resources, for energy generation. Crop residues, such as straws and husks, play a crucial role in this biomass reservoir, contributing to biofuel production and greenhouse gas mitigation efforts. Focusing on supply chains, waste management, and emission reduction, this study evaluates the sustainability of wheat straw, an agricultural biomass by-product. The environmental issues of various approaches to managing agricultural biomass were explored. Following an evaluation of biomass features, conversion methods, and economic and environmental advantages, the results show anaerobic digestion to be the most sustainable approach. Four metrics were examined in relation to social elements, and numerous aspects were considered as inputs in the evaluation of transportation costs. The use of electric trucks versus fuel-based trucks resulted in an 18% reduction in total operating costs and a 58% reduction in consumption costs. This study examined CO2 emissions over four different transportation distances. The data indicate that a significant reduction of 36% in kg CO2 equivalent emissions occurred when the distance was lowered from 100 km to 25 km. These findings offer insights for creating practical plans that should increase the sustainability of agricultural biomass leftovers.</description>

                Direct CO2 conversion to liquid hydrocarbons (HCs) in a single process was achieved using cobalt (Co) catalysts supported on lanthanum ion (La3+)&#8208;doped cerium oxide (CeO2) under a gas stream of H2/CO2/N2 = 3/1/1. The yield of liquid HCs was the highest for 30 mol% of La3+&#8208;doped CeO2, which was because extrinsic oxygen vacancy formed by doping La3+ could act as an effective reaction site for reverse water gas shift reaction. However, the excess La3+ addition afforded surface covering lanthanum carbonates, resulting in depression of the catalytic performance. On the other hand, bare CeO2 lead to an increase in the selectivity of undesirable methane, which arose from reduction of CO2 to CO proceeding by intrinsic oxygen vacancy generated by only Ce3+, and weaker CO2 capture ability of intrinsic oxygen vacancy than extrinsic one, resulting in the proceeding of Sabatier reaction on Co catalyst. The rational design of reaction sites presented in this study will contribute to sustainability.</description>

                Use of portland limestone cement (PLC) instead of ordinary portland cement (OPC) Type I/II in conventional concrete pavement and calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement instead of OPC Type III in rapid strength concrete (RSC) are commonly proposed strategies that could reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the Caltrans highway network and meet the state's climate change mitigation goals. This study aims to quantify the potential global warming abatement cost of PLC and CSA cement use in California at the project and network level using life cycle cost analysis and life cycle assessment and to determine the benefits and disbenefits of the two proposed cement types. Results from the analysis showed that the abatement cost for replacing PLC with OPC Type I/II is $180/tonne of CO2-eq reduction, while the cost for replacing OPC Type III cement with CSA in RSC is $1,422/tonne of CO2-eq reduction.</description>

                El desarrollo y la producci&#243;n industrial, han requerido un alto uso de combustibles f&#243;siles lo que ha conllevado a un deterioro ambiental, en el contexto del cambio clim&#225;tico y gracias al Protocolo de Kioto, se cre&#243; el mercado de carbono como mecanismo de la econom&#237;a verde. Mediante el m&#233;todo PRISMA se realiz&#243; una revisi&#243;n descriptiva de literatura desde 2007 hasta el a&#241;o 2022 para conocer c&#243;mo se desarroll&#243; el mercado de bonos de carbono. En un primer momento, estos instrumentos financieros negociados en mercados internacionales facilitaron a pa&#237;ses desarrollados el cumplimiento de los compromisos de reducci&#243;n de emisiones, as&#237; como la financiaci&#243;n de proyectos limpios en pa&#237;ses en desarrollo, sin embargo, su demanda disminuy&#243; en 2013 bajo la cr&#237;tica de si ten&#237;an verdadero compromiso ambiental o se estaba beneficiando a las grandes industrias para que puedan contaminar m&#225;s. Finalmente, estos documentos fueron sustituidos por la negociaci&#243;n de bonos verdes al ser m&#225;s flexibles. Palabras Clave: cambio clim&#225;tico, deterioro ambiental, di&#243;xido de carbono, mercado financiero Abstract Industrial development and production have required a high use of fossil fuels, which has led to environmental deterioration. In thecontext of climate change and thanks to the Kyoto Protocol, the carbon market was created as a mechanism of the green economy. Using the PRISMA method, a descriptive literature review was carried out from 2007 to the year 2022 to learn how the carbon credit market developed. At first, these financial instruments negotiated in international markets facilitated developed countries to comply with emission reduction commitments, as well as the financing of clean projects in developing countries, however, their demand decreased in 2013 under the criticism of whether they had true environmental commitment or were benefiting large industriesso that they could pollute more. Eventually, these documents were replaced by the trading of green bonds because they were more flexible.Keywords: climate change, carbon dioxide, environmental degradation, financial markets</description>

      <title>&lt;i&gt;In Situ&lt;/i&gt; Generated CO Enables High-Current CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction to Methanol in a Molecular Catalyst Layer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c05961</link>

                Molecular catalysts such as cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) exhibit remarkable electrochemical activity in methanol production from CO2 or CO, but fast conversion with a high current density is still yet to be realized. While adopting flow cells with gas diffusion electrodes is a common approach to enhanced reaction rates, the current scientific and engineering knowledge primarily centers on metal particle-based catalysts like Cu. This focus overlooks the emerging heterogenized molecular catalysts with distinct physical and chemical properties. In this work, we observe that the partial current density of CO reduction to methanol catalyzed by tetraamine-substituted CoPc (CoPc-NH2) supported on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) remains below 30 mA cm&#8211;2, even with systematic optimization of structural and operational parameters of the flow cell. A comparative analysis with a Cu metal catalyst reveals that the porous and electrolyte-philic nature of CoPc-NH2/CNT leaves a large fraction of active sites deprived of CO under reaction conditions. To address this microenvironmental challenge, we directly use CO2 as the reactant, leveraging its faster diffusion rate in water compared to CO. Effective CO2 reduction generates CO in situ to feed the catalytic sites, achieving an unprecedently high partial current density for methanol of 129 mA cm&#8211;2. This research underscores the necessity for new insights and approaches in the development of molecular catalyst-based electrodes.</description>

      <title>Effects of Impurities on Anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Pipeline Transport</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.4c00935</link>

                Efficient transportation of anthropogenic CO2 from emission sources to storage sites or utilization facilities is vital to realize full-scale Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS). The CO2 captured from emission sources is often contaminated with impurities that can significantly affect its thermophysical properties and flow behaviors during pipeline transportation. A holistic understanding of the impacts of these impurities is necessary to establish a cost-efficient and reliable CO2 pipeline transport system. In this study, we utilized an integrated thermophysical and fluid flow model and systematically analyzed the impurity effects of H2, N2, CH4, CO, O2, Ar, SO2, H2S, and H2 on the phase-envelopes, critical properties, density, viscosity, and pressure drop of CO2 streams. Each impurity was studied from zero to its highest concentration encountered in CCUS. The impacts of different impurities might be positive or negative to CO2 pipeline transportation depending on the system parameters being evaluated. H2 generally produces the most negative impacts on transportation, greatly enlarging the two-phase region, most significant reductions in density and viscosity, and highest pressure loss. In contrast, H2S has a much milder effect on most system properties. In this paper, we also ranked the impacts of impurities on different system properties by grading the effect of each impurity at 5 vol % concentration and discussed their indications on CO2 pipeline transportation. These results offer practical insights into the design, operation, and management of CCUS CO2 pipelines nowadays and in the future.</description>

                Prior research has highlighted substantial shifts in environmental and air quality indicators preceding and following COVID-19 lockdowns, with implications for human well-being, climate, and air pollution. This groundbreaking study pioneers the quantification of multilevel changes&#8212;spanning national, regional, and local scales&#8212;in six pivotal satellite-derived land surface and air quality parameters before (November 2019&#8211;March 2020) and after lockdown (November 2020&#8211;March 2021) in Australia. Leveraging Google Earth Engine (GEE) and GIS capabilities, three land surface environmental parameters (Land Surface Temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Built-up Index), and three air quality parameters (Aerosol Optical Depth, Carbon Monoxide, and Nitrogen Dioxide) were derived. Environmental and air quality shifts between these periods were rigorously examined employing spatial and machine learning methodologies. Nationally, the lockdown led to a reduction in average Land Surface Temperature, likely due to increased vegetation and enhanced air quality. Similar trends were observed at regional and local scales, though intriguing exceptions emerged, such as elevated Land Surface Temperature in Melbourne and Darwin. This study showcases a robust analytical framework capable of comprehensively exploring multiscale environmental and air quality alterations, enabled by harnessing extensive Earth Observation datasets and spatial machine learning techniques. It offers valuable insights into understanding the profound environmental impacts associated with significant events like the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

      <title>Application of Flotation for Removing Barium(II) Ions Using Ionized Acyclic Polyethers in the Context of Sustainable Waste Management</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114665</link>
      <description>Agnieszka Sobianowska-Turek, Katarzyna Grudniewska, A. Fornalczyk, J. Willner, W. Bialik, Weronika Urba&#324;ska, Anna Janda, Sustainability. 16(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399172384

                Energy transition is one of the basic actions taken to counteract and prevent climate change. The basic assumption of energy-related changes is its sustainable use according to the closed-loop model, as well as moving away from fossil fuels, in particular from coal, the combustion of which contributes to excessive harmful carbon dioxide emissions. One of the most popular solutions towards green energy is nuclear energy. Its use allows for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions harmful to the environment and climate, but it also involves the generation of radioactive waste that requires appropriate processing. This paper presents the results of the flotation removal of barium(II) ions from a dilute aqueous solution using ionized acyclic polyethers. The basic factors determining the efficiency and kinetics of the process were defined. It has been shown that as the acidity of the attached polyether molecules increases: the flotation rate constant 1 (0.1667 min&#8722;1) &lt; 3 (0.2468 min&#8722;1) &lt; 2 (0.3616 min&#8722;1) and the separation degree Ba2+: 1 (86.8%) &lt; 3 (99.3%) &lt; 2 (99.4%). The presented results of ion flotation tests may facilitate the collective or selective separation of radioactive isotopes, i.e., Cs-137, Sr-90, Ba-133 and Co-60, from radioactive wastewater in the future. The results of the experimental work described in the article can also be used to develop individual processes for separating mixtures of radioactive isotopes (radioactive wastewater) into individual components (isotopes) and subjecting them to subsequent transformation processes. The obtained results allow us to claim that the tested organic compounds can be used in the future in the selective treatment of hazardous wastewater, which will translate into a reduction in unit costs of industrial processes. The selective recovery of individual pollutants is the basis for the next step in waste management, i.e., designing a cheap method of waste disposal, which also directly affects the economics of the process and its use in industrial conditions.</description>

      <title>Research and Application of Non-Steady-State CO2 Huff-n-Puff Oil Recovery Technology in High-Water-Cut and Low-Permeability Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12061120</link>
      <description>Zhenjun Wang, Zhufeng Wang, Wei Luo, S. Li, Shisheng Liang, Xianfeng Wang, Xiaohu Xue, Ning Tu, Shudong He, Processes. 12(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399124951

                In response to the issues of poor water flooding efficiency, low oil production rates, and low recovery rates during the high-water-cut period in the low-permeability reservoirs of the Mutou Oilfield, the non-steady-state (NSS) CO2 huff-n-puff oil recovery technology was explored. The NSS CO2 huff-n-puff can improve the development effect of low-permeability reservoirs by replenishing the reservoir energy and significantly increasing the crude oil mobility. Experimental investigations were carried out, including a crude oil and CO2&#8211;crude oil swelling experiment, minimum miscibility pressure testing experiment, high-temperature and high-pressure microfluidic experiment, and NSS CO2 huff-n-puff oil recovery on-site pilot test. The experimental results showed that the main mechanisms of NSS CO2 huff-n-puff include dissolution, expansion, viscosity reduction, and swept volume enlargement, which can effectively mobilize the remaining oil from the various pore throats within the reservoir. The high-temperature and high-pressure microfluidic experiment achieved an ultimate recovery rate of 83.1% for NSS CO2 huff-n-puff, which was 7.9% higher than the rate of 75.2% obtained for steady injection. This method can effectively utilize the remaining oil in the corners and edges, enlarge the swept volume, and increase the recovery rate. Field trials of NSS CO2 huff-n-puff in a low-permeability reservoir in the Mutou Oilfield indicated that it cumulatively increased the oil production by 1134.5 tons. The achieved results and insights were systematically analyzed and could provide key technical support for the application of NSS CO2 huff-n-puff technology in low-permeability reservoirs, promoting the innovative development of this technology.</description>

                Metallic iron (Fe) typically demonstrates the unfavorable catalytic activity for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), mainly attributed to the excessively strong binding of CO products on Fe sites. Toward this end, we employed an effective approach involving electronic structure modulation through nitrogen (N) integration to enhance the performance of the CO2RR. Here, an efficient catalyst has been developed, composed of N-doped metallic iron (Fe) nanoparticles encapsulated in a porous N-doped carbon framework. Notably, this N-integrated Fe catalyst displays significantly enhanced performance in the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2, yielding the highest CO Faradaic efficiency of 97.5% with a current density of 6.68 mA cm&#8211;2 at &#8722;0.7 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. The theoretical calculations, combined with the in situ attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy study, reveal that N integration modulates the electron density around Fe, resulting in the weakening of the binding strength between the Fe active sites and *CO intermediates, consequently promoting the desorption of CO and the overall CO2RR process.</description>

      <title>Stress corrosion phenomenon of casing in CO2 medium and magnetic memory detection</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.58286/29923</link>
      <description>Qian Chen, Jun Fan, Laibin Zhang, Jing Sun, E-Journal of nondestructive testing. 29(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398763018

                Due to being in an acidic CO2 environment and high-pressure underground, the stress corrosion phenomenon on the inner wall of the CCUS wellbore is more pronounced, with the possibility of wall thickness reduction and crack propagation, which affects the integrity and storage reliability of the wellbore. This article conducted indoor experiments on stress corrosion of oil casing, and characterized the stress corrosion through magnetic memory detection technology. Through experiments, the stress corrosion morphology of specimens under different concentrations, stresses, and defects was obtained. The microstructure of the stress corrosion site was observed using SEM electron microscopy, and the stress corrosion situation of the material in CO2 was observed, laying a foundation for magnetic memory detection; A stress corrosion detection method under CO2 environment was proposed, and the magnetic memory detection method was used to measure that the more severe the stress corrosion, the more obvious the magnetic signal mutation; The shape and morphology of different defects vary, but the main factors affecting magnetic memory signals are concentration and loading force. This article verifies the feasibility of magnetic memory in stress corrosion detection through experiments, and characterizes the stress corrosion situation using magnetic memory signals, which is of great significance for non-destructive testing of wellbore stress corrosion in CO2 storage.</description>

      <title>Gallium-Mediated Switch in Product Selectivity for Co2 Hydrogenation Over Ni/Ceo2 Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4847328</link>

                Achieving high activities and selectivity for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction at low-temperatures continues to pose a significant challenge. Ni-based catalysts have been widely employed in CO2 hydrogenation due to their strong capacity to dissociate H2, but they exhibit low selectivity for CO. Herein, we successfully altered the product selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation via controlling the distribution of Ga species on Ni/CeO2 catalysts. When Ga was combined with Ni to form the spinel of NiGa2O4 (NiGa2O4/CeO2), the main product selectivity was CO. While, the Ga was doped into CeO2 to support Ni (Ni/Ga4-CeO2), the product selectivity was the CH4. The NiGa2O4 spinel supported on CeO2 exhibited excellent performance in the RWGS reaction, with a CO selectivity over 99%, and a production rate as high as 74.5 mmol/gcat&#183;h at 450 oC and 24000 mL/gcat&#183;h, without any loss of activity after 72 h. The Ni/Ga4-CeO2, containing metallic Ni species and abundant oxygen vacancies, enhanced the methanation process, with a CO2 conversion as high as 81.38%, and a CH4 production rate of 136 mmol/gcat&#183;h. The CO-TPD analysis revealed that the NiGa2O4/CeO2 catalyst exhibited weak adsorption of CO*, which played a key role in enhancing the selectivity towards CO. Subsequent in-situ DRIFTS analysis further confirmed that the differences in CO2 hydrogenation product obtained from NiGa4/CeO2 and Ni/Ga4-CeO2 were due to the formation of different intermediate species over their surface, leading to a change in the selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation products. This study provides a new idea to switch the product selectivity for CO2 reduction by controlling the distribution of Ga species.</description>

      <title>Impacts of climate change and vegetation response on future aridity in a Mediterranean catchment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2024.108878</link>

                The climate in the Mediterranean region is expected to become warmer and drier but future projections of precipitation are uncertain, especially in the Northern part. Additionally, the difficulty in determining the plant physiological responses caused by CO2 rising complicates the estimation of future evaporative demand, increasing the uncertainty of future aridity assessments. Vegetation responses to rising CO2 are expected to increase radiation use efficiency and reduce stomatal conductance, hence increasing plant's water use efficiency. These effects are often neglected when estimating future drought and aridity. Hence, the main objective of this study is to estimate the effect of climate change and vegetation stomatal conductance reduction on projected water balance components and the resulting impact on aridity in a medium-sized catchment of Central Italy. We validate and couple a hydrological model with climate projections from five regional climate models and perform simulations considering the vegetation responses or not. Results show that their inclusion significantly affects potential evapotranspiration. The other water balance components, namely actual evapotranspiration, water yield, percolation, and irrigation, are also influenced but with less significant changes. Considering or not the CO2 suppression effect on stomatal conductance, coupled with the uncertainty related to precipitation, highly affects the estimation of future aridity as the future climate classification ranges from "humid" to "semi-arid" depending on the simulation and climate model, even if model outputs need to be evaluated cautiously with CO2 concentration higher than 660 ppm.</description>

      <title>Tethered Alkylammonium Dications as Electrochemical Interface Modifiers: Chain Length Effect on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction Selectivity at Industry-Relevant Current Density</title>

                The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) has the potential to be an economically viable method to produce platform chemicals synergistically with renewable energy sources. Copper is one of the most commonly used electrocatalysts for this purpose, as it allows C&#8211;C bond formation, yielding a broad product distribution. Controlling selectivity is a stepping stone on the way to its industrial application. The kinetics of the reaction can be modified to favor the rates of certain products quickly and inexpensively by applying additives such as ionic liquids and coelectrolytes that directly affect the electrocatalytic interface. In this work, we propose tethered tetraalkylammonium salts as double-charged cationic modifiers of the electrochemical double layer to control CO2RR product selectivity. A novel setup comprising a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) flow cell coupled with real-time mass spectroscopy was used to study the effect of a library of the selected salts. We emphasize how the length of an alkyl linker effectively controls the selectivity of the reaction toward C1, C2, or C3 products at high relevant current densities (Jtotal = &#8722;400 mA cm&#8211;2) along with the inhibition of the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction. Standard long-term experiments were performed for quantitative validation and stability evaluation. These results have broad implications for further tailoring an effective catalytic system for selective CO2 reduction reaction.</description>

      <title>Regulating Adsorption of Intermediates via the Sulfur Modulating Dual-Atomic Sites for Boosting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR</title>

                The formation of dual-atom catalysts or heteroatom ligand modulation is the most promising strategy for optimizing single&#8211;atom catalysts (SACs) for the more efficient conversion of CO2 to valuable chemicals. However, heteroatom ligands introduced into the dual-atomic sites are expected but still under-explored. In this study, a dual-atom Fe&#8211;Ni pair electrocatalyst with N&#8211; and S&#8211;coordination in porous carbon nanosheets was conceptually predicted for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO (CO2RR). In contrast to SACs and traditional diatomic catalysts (DACs), joined S&#8211;coordination can balance the cooperative activities of Fe and Ni sites, making the CO2 adsorption configuration bidentate at both Fe&#8211;Ni sites. This regulation leads to a substantial change in CO* adsorption from Fe to Ni sites, facilitating CO desorption and boosting the electrocatalytic CO2RR. Experimental results demonstrate that the obtained FeNi&#8211;NSC catalyst achieves high selectivity with the Faradaic efficiencies for CO of 96.1%, and a remarkable activity with the turnover frequency of 6526.9 h&#8211;1 at &#8722;1.0 V, which were over 4.5 and 2.5 times of those from the single Fe or Ni sites. This work gives us insight into designing highly effective catalysts guided by theoretical calculation.</description>

Abstract The demand for renewable sources of energy is increasing due to the many advantages provided by these sources, mainly the reduction of toxic and harmful emissions of human health. Solar energy in particular - as a source of renewable energy - plays a promising role in both developing and developed countries. It is a clean source of energy and environmentally friendly because it can be used to generate electricity without accompanying emissions of greenhouse gases or toxic gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides and others. On the other hand, it is easy to install solar cells on rooftops and thus can be a means to produce clean electricity in rural areas. Despite the advantages offered by solar energy, its use in generating electricity in Egypt is still very limited and is in no way commensurate with the potential available in Egypt from this source of renewable energy sources.</description>

                This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) extraction in enhancing the extraction rate, purity, and antioxidant activity of Indocalamus latifolius (Keng) McClure (Poaceae) leaf terpenoids (ILLTs). Crude extracts obtained from leaves were subjected to qualitative and quantitative analyses, revealing neophytadiene, phytol, &#946;-sitosterol, &#946;-amyrone, squalene, and friedelin as the primary terpenoid constituents, identified through gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Compared with steam distillation extraction (SD), simultaneous distillation extraction (SDE), ultra-high pressure-assisted n-hexane extraction (UHPE-Hex), ultra-high pressure-assisted ethanol extraction (UHPE-EtOH), ultrasound-assisted n-hexane extraction (UE-Hex), and ultrasound-assisted ethanol extraction (UE-EtOH), SC-CO2 exhibited a superior ILLT extraction rate, purity, and antioxidant activity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations of the residues further revealed more severe damage to both the residues and their cell walls after SC-CO2 extraction. Under optimal parameters (4.5 h, 26 MPa, 39 &#176;C, and 20% ethyl alcohol), the ILLT extraction rate with SC-CO2 reached 1.44 &#177; 0.12 mg/g, which was significantly higher than the rates obtained by the other six methods. The subsequent separation and purification using WelFlash C18-l, BUCHI-C18, and Sephadex LH-20 led to an increase in the purity of the six terpenoid components from 12.91% to 93.34%. Furthermore, the ILLTs demonstrated cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells with an IC50 value of 148.93 &#177; 9.93 &#956;g/mL. Additionally, with increasing concentrations, the ILLTs exhibited an enhanced cellular antioxidant status, as evidenced by reductions in both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels.</description>

                Tandem photovoltaics applying perovskite on silicon are considered to be a possible route to sustaining continuous efficiency improvements and price reductions. A meaningful market share for such tandems is, however, at least a decade away. Herein, a comprehensive prospective life cycle assessment was conducted, comparing the full life cycle of monofacial and bifacial silicon/perovskite tandem panels with single-junction silicon panels produced up to 2050. The end-of-life included the recovery of silicon and silver. Climate change impacts per kilowatt hour were projected to decrease by two-thirds over time. Tandem panels are expected to reach impacts of 8&#8211;10 g CO2-eq/kWh in 2050, while single-junction panels may reach 11&#8211;13 g CO2-eq/kWh in 2050. Other midpoint impact categories with substantial contributions to damaging human health and ecosystem quality were toxicity, particulate matter formation, and acidification, with tandems having lower impacts in each category. Reductions in impacts over time are mainly the result of grid mix decarbonization and panel efficiency improvements. Balance-of-system and recycling were found to contribute substantially to these impact categories. To ensure that tandem panels provide environmental benefits, annual degradation rates should not exceed 1% for monofacial or 3% for bifacial tandems, and refurbishment of panels with advanced degradation is crucial.</description>

      <title>Carbon Footprint of a Nearly Zero Energy Building in Accra (Ghana): an LCA-based Model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.7250/conect.2024.038</link>
      <description>Francesco Romagnoli, Claudio Rochas, Riccardo Paoli, Augustine Owusuansah, Cornelius Odai, Silvia Kobel, CONECT. International Scientific Conference of Environmental and Climate Technologies. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399067641

                This study presents a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) in Accra, Ghana, comparing its environmental impact with a conventional Business-As-Usual (BAU) building over a 50-year lifespan. Adhering to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards, the research evaluates the carbon footprint and operational efficiencies essential to sustainable building designs. Utilizing SimaPro 9.5 software and the IPCC 2021 GWP100 method, the total carbon footprint was quantified at 1727 tons of CO2-equivalent for the NZEB, significantly lower than the BAU comparison. The analysis highlights the operational phase, including waste generation as the most substantial contributor to the NZEB's environmental impact, accounting for 725 tons of CO2-equivalent emissions. Conversely, the strategic inclusion of solar panels and enhanced material selection for the NZEB markedly reduced energy demands, contributing to a net positive environmental outcome with an avoided carbon footprint of approximately -859.72 tons CO2-eq. This reduction underpins the NZEB's effectiveness in leveraging eco-friendly materials and renewable technologies, setting a benchmark for future sustainable construction practices. The study ultimately advocates for an integrated approach, harmonizing technological innovation with environmental stewardship, to mitigate the carbon footprint of the built environment, steering the construction industry towards sustainability.</description>

      <title>Catalytic conversion of CO2 to dimethyl ether: A review of recent advances in catalysts and water selective layer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiec.2024.05.058</link>
      <description>Ng Jia Le, Yeong Yin Fong, Journal of industrial and engineering chemistry/Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry - Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399143386

                Emissions of CO2 from different sectors including oil and gas, energy, agriculture and industries have increased significantly over the past decades. In order to achieve carbon reduction target of cutting down carbon intensity against gross domestic product (GDP) by 45% by 2030 compared to 2010 and reaching net zero emission by 2050 as per stated in Paris Climate Agreement, Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) technology have been widely applied to alleviate the CO2 emissions problem. Among the CO2 utilization strategies, conversion of CO2 to dimethyl ether (DME) is considered as one of the most attractive routes for the large-scale CO2 valorization due to its advantage to serve as an alternative fuel for diesel and wide application in various industry which leads to large global market size for DME. Synthesis of DME from CO2 can be achieved through both indirect and direct synthesis processes in which indirect synthesis of DME will undergo CO2 hydrogenation over metallic catalyst and dehydration of methanol over acid catalyst separately, while direct synthesis of DME will undergo both reactions within a single reactor over a bifunctional catalyst. However, low CO2 conversion, low DME selectivity and also rapid catalyst deactivation due to the formation of water throughout the DME synthesis process have attracted increased attentions from researchers of modifying metallic catalysts through addition of zirconium, iron, palladium and other element as promoter, discover alternative acid catalysts to replace commercial &#947;-Al2O3 and to develop bifunctional catalyst through combining metallic catalyst with acid catalyst to enable the operation of direct DME synthesis. Thus, a series of researches have been conducted to study the performance of different catalysts under different combination of elements in order to improve the DME yield from the reaction. Aside from that, another strategy has also been performed in past few years by application of water selective membrane layer in the DME synthesis process to reduce the impacts of water formation towards the DME yields. Thus, in-situ water removal performance for different types of polymeric and zeolite membranes as well as dual-layer (FAU-LTA) membrane in DME synthesis have been investigated in recent years. In this review paper, development and performance of several main types of metallic catalysts, acid catalysts, bifunctional catalysts and water selective hydrophilic membrane which have been reported will be discussed to understand the gaps for current research on DME synthesis. In the aspect of future work, the performance for different combinations of bifunctional catalysts with water selective removal layer in direct DME synthesis need to be explored. Besides, the use of metallic catalyst together with acidic water selective membrane or dual layer membrane can be a potential future trend to improve CO2 conversion and DME yield.</description>

      <title>Relation to Blood Chemistry and Acid-Base Balance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780197584569.003.0173</link>

                Abstract The physiologic mechanisms of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) buffering in relation to blood chemistry and acid-base balance are crucial in understanding the ventilatory response to metabolic derangements and induced changes in intracranial pressure (ICP). Hyperventilation is often used in the context of head trauma or neurosurgical procedures to reduce ICP; however, careful use of this technique is critical. Because non-ionized CO2 molecules, and not ionized molecules such as H+, are able to cross the blood-brain barrier, induced changes in cerebrovascular blood flow (CBF) are largely independent of systemic arterial pH. Due to compensatory mechanisms, CBF will return to baseline as both blood and CSF pH return to normal over 6&#8211;24 hours, regardless of continued hyperventilation. Preoperative communication with the neurosurgical team prior to procedure is key for planning any potential need for reduction in ICP to improve operative conditions. Postoperatively this return to baseline must be kept in mind as prolonged hyperventilation also results in increased &#8220;CO2 reactivity,&#8221; making the patient more susceptible to acute rises in ICP.</description>

                Biosynthetic strategy of ferrous sulfide (FeS) through Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 in bioelectrochemical systems has been extensively explored to maintain bettered electron transfer performance. In this study, the simultaneous FeS biosynthesis and CO2 reduction were conducted in the microbial electrosynthesis (MES) system, aiming at improving electron transfer efficiency as well as acetate production. It was shown that the FeS was successfully biomineralized and then loaded onto the sludge in the Fe3+/S2O32&#8722;/MR-1 group, of which the acetate accumulation increased by 87.50%, 64.63% and 33.66% than the control, MR-1 and Fe3+/S2O32&#8722; groups. Also, electrochemical performance revealed by the CV analysis was enhanced, whereas the increased EPS accumulation and intracellular electron transfer activity by the biosynthesized FeS could also be proved. Moreover, the biogenic FeS enriched the abundances of acetogenic and sulfur-utilizing species as Acetobacterium, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_13, Sulfuricurvum and Desulfovibrio. Meanwhile, strongly positive correlations between Shewanella, the sulfur utilizers and acetogens were confirmed in the Fe3+/S2O32&#8722;/MR-1 group. With improved electron transfer efficiency and the boosted acetate accumulation, the in-situ biogenic FeS might be promising for CO2 capture and utilization.</description>

      <title>Production of glycerol carbonate by coupling glycerol and CO2 over various metal oxide catalyst</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcou.2024.102813</link>
      <description>Yihu Ke, Heng Xu, Xue Wang, Hai Liu, Hong Yuan, Journal of CO2 utilization. 83(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399107301

                A series of metal oxides, i.e., CuO&#12289;NiO&#12289;Co3O4&#12289;ZrO2&#12289;Al2O3, catalysts were prepared by hydrothermal method and evaluated in the production of glycerol carbonate by coupling of glycerol and CO2 under lower temperature. The results show that CuO showed the best catalytic performance (glycerol conversion and the glycerol carbonate selectivity were 89.0 % and 69.4 %, respectively) at 120 &#8451; under 3.0 MPa of CO2 for 5 h. This is the highest yield of glycerol carbonate using same mothed reported in the literature so far. The structures, morphologies and surface properties of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption-desorption, Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Temperature programmed desorption (TPD). It is speculated that the high catalytic activity of CuO mainly depends on its unique structure and acid-base physicochemical properties. In addition, the CuO catalyst was used 7 times without obvious deactivation, which suggesting this catalysis has excellent reusability.</description>

                This research aims to analyze the efficiency of triangular and trapezoidal membership functions in forecasting CO2, N2O, and CH4 emissions in Indian smart cities. Over 10-years, emissions data for these gases were collected and used to determine membership values for both functions. The study evaluated the performance of the membership functions using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values and percentage error analysis. The results indicated that the trapezoidal membership function provided more accurate results for CO2 and CH4 emissions, while the triangular membership function was more accurate for N2O emissions. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate membership functions tailored to specific gases to enhance emission forecast accuracy. The study emphasizes the significance of such insights for decision-makers, urban planners, and environmental agencies involved in emissions reduction measures and smart city development. However, further research is recommended to validate these findings and explore additional factors that may influence the performance of membership functions in emission prediction in smart cities. In conclusion, this project offers a comprehensive analysis of triangular and trapezoidal membership functions&#8217; accuracy in predicting emissions in Indian smart cities, emphasizing the crucial factors.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Production by Steam Reforming of Ethanol and Dry Reforming of Methane with CO2 on Ni/Vermiculite: Stability Improvement via Acid or Base Treatment of the Support</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29112575</link>
      <description>Hanane Mahir, Abdellah Benzaouak, Farah Mesrar, Adnane El Hamidi, M. El Kacimi, Luca Consentino, Leonarda Francesca Liotta, Molecules/Molecules online/Molecules annual. 29(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399155977

                In this study, vermiculite was explored as a support material for nickel catalysts in two key processes in syngas production: dry reforming of methane with CO2 and steam reforming of ethanol. The vermiculite underwent acid or base treatment, followed by the preparation of Ni catalysts through incipient wetness impregnation. Characterization was conducted using various techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM&#8211;EDS, FTIR, and temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR). TG-TD analyses were performed to assess the formation of carbon deposits on spent catalysts. The Ni-based catalysts were used in reaction tests without a reduction pre-treatment. Initially, raw vermiculite-supported nickel showed limited catalytic activity in the dry reforming of methane. After acid (Ni/VTA) or base (Ni/VTB) treatment, vermiculite proved to be an effective support for nickel catalysts that displayed outstanding performance, achieving high methane conversion and hydrogen yield. The acidic treatment improved the reduction of nickel species and reduced carbon deposition, outperforming the Ni over alkali treated support. The prepared catalysts were also evaluated in ethanol steam reforming under various conditions including temperature, water/ethanol ratio, and space velocity, with acid-treated catalysts confirming the best performance.</description>

                The natural gas (NG)-powered compressors/engines used in liquified natural gas (LNG) plants are a major source of methane emission. The Allam&#8211;Fetvedt cycle (AFC), an oxyfuel, carbon-neutral, high-efficiency power plant, generates pipeline-grade CO2. This work performed novel process modeling, economic analysis, and greenhouse gas emissions analysis for a heat-integrated, electrified LNG/AFC/air separation unit (ASU) complex (LAA), then compared it to standalone LNG and AFC/ASU plants (baseline) as well as an LNG plant electrified with AFC/ASU without heat integration. The low-grade heat generated from compressors of the LNG plant can enhance the AFC net power output by 7.1%. Utilizing the nitrogens cold energy reduces the compressor power requirement by 1.6%. In the integrated LAA complex, not only are GHG emissions avoided, but the energy efficiencies are also improved for both the LNG plant and the AFC power plant. A cash flow analysis of LAA was performed over a 20-year period with 5%, 7%, and 10% discount rates and three levels of LNG prices. The 45Q CO2 credit of USD 85/T as stipulated by the recent Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 has been incorporated. The results clearly indicate the economic and environmental benefits of the proposed electrification and heat/power integration.</description>

                As cement is the primary cause of CO2 emission, an attempt is made to replace the cement and it is done by replacing the cement with GGBS and silica fume along with activators such as sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide. By enrolling such materials in concrete, it will ensure the reduction of environmental consequences. This research is done by replacing of the cement with GGBS and silica fume without involving any type of admixtures. And it is done for M 30 grade with varying GGBS i.e., 90%, 80%, 70% and 60%. And to accelerate the pozzolanic effect, silica fume is added in diverse proportions i.e., 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%. Sodium hydroxide is kept constant throughout. Specimens were prepared for testing and ambient curing of 7 &amp; 28 days has done. Tests such as compressive, split-tensile and flexural strength test are performed to obtain the mechanical behaviour of the concrete.</description>

      <title>Multi-model effective radiative forcing of the 2020 sulphur cap for shipping</title>

                Abstract. New regulations of sulphur emissions from shipping were introduced in 2020, reducing emissions of SO2 from international shipping by ~80 %. As SO2 is an aerosol precursor, this drop in emission over the ocean will weaken the total aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) that historically has masked an uncertain fraction of the warming due to increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Here, we use four global climate models and a chemistry transport model to calculate the ERF due to an 80 % reduction in SO2 emissions from international shipping relative to 2019 emission estimates. The model means of the ERF range from 0.06 to 0.09 W m-2 corresponding to the ERF due to the increase in CO2 concentration over the last two to three years.</description>

                Improving ligand-to-active metal charge transfer (LAMCT) by finely tuning the organic ligand is a decisive strategy to enhance charge transfer in metal organic frameworks (MOFs)-based catalysts. However, in most MOFs loaded with active metal catalysts, electron transmission encounters massive obstacle at the interface between the two constituents owing to poor LAMCT. Herein, amines (&#8211;NH2) functionalized MOFs (NH2-MIL-101(Cr)) encapsulated active metal Pt nanoclusters (NCs) catalysts are synthesized by the polyol reduction method and utilized for the photoreduction of CO2. Surprisingly, the introduction of &#8211;NH2 (electron donating) groups within the matrix of MIL-101(Cr) improved the electron migration through the LAMCT process, fostering a synergistic interaction with Pt. The combined experimental analysis exposed the high number of metallic Pt (Pt0) in Pt@NH2-MIL-101(Cr) catalyst through seamless electron shuttling from N of &#8211;NH2 group to excited Pt generating versatile hybrid Pt-N catalytic centres. Consequently, these versatile hybrid catalytic centres act as electro-nucleophilic centres, which enable the efficient and selective conversion of CO bond in CO2 to harvest CH4 (131.0 &#181;mol.g&#8722;1) and maintain excellent stability and selectivity for consecutive five rounds, superior to Pt@MIL-101(Cr) and most reported catalysts. Our study verified that the precise tuning of organic ligands in MOFs immensely improves the surface-active centres, electron migration, and catalytic selectivity of the excited Pt NCs catalysts encaged inside MOFs through an improved LAMCT pathway.</description>

      <title>Large potential of strengthening the land carbon sink in China through anthropogenic interventions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2024.05.037</link>
      <description>Xu Yue, Hao Zhou, Yang Cao, Hong Liao, Xiaofei Lu, Zhen Yu, Wenping Yuan, Zhu Li, Yadong Lei, Stephen Sitch, J&#252;rgen Knauer, Huijun Wang, Science Bulletin. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399143230

                The terrestrial ecosystem in China mitigates 21%-45% of the national contemporary fossil fuel CO2 emissions every year. Maintaining and strengthening the land carbon sink is essential for reaching China's target of carbon neutrality. However, this sink is subject to large uncertainties due to the joint impacts of climate change, air pollution, and human activities. Here, we explore the potential of strengthening land carbon sink in China through anthropogenic interventions, including forestation, ozone reduction, and litter removal, taking advantage of a well-validated dynamic vegetation model and meteorological forcings from 16 climate models. Without anthropogenic interventions, considering Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios, the land sink is projected to be 0.26-0.56 Pg C a-1 at 2060, to which climate change contributes 0.06-0.13 Pg C a-1 and CO2 fertilization contributes 0.08-0.44 Pg C a-1 with the stronger effects for higher emission scenarios. With anthropogenic interventions, under a close-to-neutral emission scenario (SSP1-2.6), the land sink becomes 0.47-0.57 Pg C a-1 at 2060, including the contributions of 0.12 Pg C a-1 by conservative forestation, 0.07 Pg C a-1 by ozone pollution control, and 0.06-0.16 Pg C a-1 by 20% litter removal over planted forest. This sink can mitigate 90%-110% of the residue anthropogenic carbon emissions at 2060, providing a solid foundation for the carbon neutrality in China.</description>

                Knowledge of the thermal phenomena that occur during stamping is important for improving the design and performance of stamping die thermal structures. A new mathematical full-scale model for energy and carbon flows is established based on operational data from a cold stamping production line in China. Moreover, numerical simulations of the thermal-fluid&#8211;solid coupling field for a cooling medium in an asymmetrically heated rectangular channel with high heat flux and strong wall superheating are carried out with a suitable CFD solver. The results are discussed in detail and compared with theoretical calculations, and the deviation of the surface heat transfer coefficient is &#177; 11.9 %. Emphasis is placed on parametric effects of variables controlling thermal characteristics on cold stamping with an active cooling structure. The effects of heat flux, and ambient temperature on temperature rise, pressure drops, and heat transfer coefficients are limited less than 7 &#176;C, 167 Pa and 45.11 % under specific operating conditions, respectively. While the heat transfer coefficient and pressure drops are increased hundreds of times with inlet velocity. The fluid cooling performance, threshold value, and approaches for heat transfer enhancement are obtained. Finally, the CO2 emissions rates is assessed as approximately 1.8 g per piece associated with stamping operations, as well as major contributors, CO2 reduction potential, and economic impacts. Negative energy consumption can be achieved with active cooling. These results can help to improve production quality in the future application and provide theoretical support for determining the causes of metal sheet tensile cracking accidents.</description>

      <title>Observed decade-long improvement of combustion efficiency in the Yangtze River Delta region in China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad521e</link>
      <description>Zhao Jin, Huilin Chen, Ximeng Qi, Xuguang Chi, Mengwei Jia, Fei Jiang, Sheng Zhong, Bo Zheng, Aijun Ding, Environmental research letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399163941

                Abstract The &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratio is a good indicator of the combustion efficiency of carbon-containing fuels, and can be useful to assess the combustion efficiency on a regional scale. In this study, we analyzed in-situ observations of CO2 and CO concentrations from 2011 to 2021 at the Station for Observing Regional Processes of the Earth System (SORPES), in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of eastern China, and calculated the &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratio to investigate the combustion efficiency in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. Furthermore, we used a Lagrangian particle dispersion model WRF-FLEXPART to evaluate the contribution of each emission sources to the observed &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratio. We found that the observed &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratio showed a persistent decreasing trend of 1.0 ppb/ppm per year and decreased ~47.9% during this period, illustrating an evident improvement in the combustion efficiency in the YRD region. The improvement of the combustion efficiency is a result of China&#8217;s Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan announced in 2013. However, the decrease of &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratio slowed down from 1.3 ppb/ppm per year during 2011-2016 to 0.6 ppb/ppm per year during 2017-2021. The simulation results reveal that the slowdown of the decrease in the &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratios can be explained by the slowing improvement of combustion efficiency in steel source in the industry sector. Our results verify the effectiveness of emission reduction efforts in YRD region and highlight the necessity of long-term observations of CO2 and CO.&amp;#xD;</description>

      <title>COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF EMISSIONS, PERFORMANCE, AND ECONOMICS PARAMETERS FOR A DUAL&#8211;FUEL DIESEL GENERATOR OPERATING WITH RICE BRAN BIODIESEL AND HYDROGEN</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e32109</link>

                The first step to achieving an energy transition is partially substituting fossil fuels with other more environmentally friendly alternatives, such as hydrogen gas. The current research aims to evaluate the influence of hydrogen in a diesel generator fueled with rice bran biodiesel. The above encourages the use of hydrogen and biodiesel production from residual raw material. For the development of the research, a diesel engine bench was used, which operated in five load conditions: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%, and was fed with three fuels: -100%, RB-10%, and RB-10% + H2(30%). The results show that the mixture RB-10% + H2(30%) causes a 3.14% reduction in BSFC and a 3.26% increase in energy conversion efficiency. In addition, it is observed that a 9.90%, 12.57%, and 10.99% decrease in HC, CO, and smoke opacity emissions compared to pure diesel. On the other hand, the mixture RB-10% + H2(30%) reduces by 4.44%, 5.07%, and 7.06% the environmental, social, and ecological impact due to CO2, HC, and CO emissions, as well as a 3.93% reduction in engine operating cost compared to RB-10% biodiesel. In general, hydrogen injection is a promising alternative to promote the use of rice bran biodiesel due to its increased performance characteristics and reduced pollutant emissions without the need to modify the engine.</description>

      <title>Size reduction of biochar to nanoscale decrease polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals content and bioavailability in nanobiochar</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173372</link>
      <description>Monika Raczkiewicz, Ond&#345;ej Ma&#353;ek, Yong Sik Ok, Patryk Oleszczuk, Science of the total environment. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398768750

                Objective of this research was to investigate ball milling of biochar from various feedstocks (willow, rice husk, oilseed rape, sewage sludge) under different pyrolysis conditions (500 and 750 &#176;C, N2 and CO2 atmosphere) on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals content. A significant reduction in both total (Ctotal &#931;16) (1.1 to 2.4-fold decrease) and freely available (Cfree &#931;16) (1.1 to 2.9-fold decrease) PAHs in nanobiochar (n-BC), particularly in sewage sludge (SSL)-derived n-BC was observed. The changes in biochar surface characteristics induced by ball milling, such as surface area, pore volume, and hydrophilicity, contribute to the decreased PAHs content. Mechanisms involving mechanochemical degradation, free-radical reactions, and defects on the biochar surface may explain the decrease of PAHs. The n-BC showed lower log Kd values for PAHs (reduced by 14 to 41 %) compared to bulk biochar (b-BC), indicating reduced effectiveness in immobilizing PAHs. The ball milling significantly reduced also metal contents by 37 to 55 %, especially in willow pellets and agricultural residue (rice husk and oilseed rape straw) with optimal reduction (by 55 %) observed for WL-derived n-BC produced at 650 &#176;C. Importantly, no metals were detected in the aqueous phase after ball milling, ensuring environmental safety of these materials. Reduction mechanisms of metals during ball milling include stable aggregate formation, enhanced defects in crystalline structures, and irreversible adsorption onto new surfaces. The results demonstrate that the application of an eco-friendly ball milling method allows for the production of materials characterized by reduced contamination levels, which is crucial from an environmental protection viewpoint.</description>

      <title>High night temperature stress on rice (Oryza sativa) &#8211; insights from phenomics to physiology. A review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/fp24057</link>
      <description>Awais Riaz, Julie Thomas, Hafiz Haider Ali, Muhammad Saqlain Zaheer, Naushad Ahmad, Andy Pereira, Functional plant biology. 51(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399194804

                Rice (Oryza sativa) faces challenges to yield and quality due to urbanisation, deforestation and climate change, which has exacerbated high night temperature (HNT). This review explores the impacts of HNT on the physiological, molecular and agronomic aspects of rice growth. Rise in minimum temperature threatens a potential 41% reduction in rice yield by 2100. HNT disrupts rice growth stages, causing reduced seed germination, biomass, spikelet sterility and poor grain development. Recent findings indicate a 4.4% yield decline for every 1&#176;C increase beyond 27&#176;C, with japonica ecotypes exhibiting higher sensitivity than indica. We examine the relationships between elevated CO2, nitrogen regimes and HNT, showing that the complexity of balancing positive CO2 effects on biomass with HNT challenges. Nitrogen enrichment proves crucial during the vegetative stage but causes disruption to reproductive stages, affecting grain yield and starch synthesis. Additionally, we elucidate the impact of HNT on plant respiration, emphasising mitochondrial respiration, photorespiration and antioxidant responses. Genomic techniques, including CRISPR-Cas9, offer potential for manipulating genes for HNT tolerance. Plant hormones and carbohydrate enzymatic activities are explored, revealing their intricate roles in spikelet fertility, grain size and starch metabolism under HNT. Gaps in understanding genetic factors influencing heat tolerance and potential trade-offs associated with hormone applications remain. The importance of interdisciplinary collaboration is needed to provide a holistic approach. Research priorities include the study of regulatory mechanisms, post-anthesis effects, cumulative HNT exposure and the interaction between climate variability and HNT impact to provide a research direction to enhance rice resilience in a changing climate.</description>

      <title>Plasma Engineering toward Improving the Microwave-Absorbing/Shielding Feature of a Biomass-Derived Material</title>

                During the past decade, ever-increasing electromagnetic pollution has excited a global concern. A sustainable resource, facile experimental scenario, fascinating reflection loss (RL), and broad efficient bandwidth are the substantial factors that intrigue researchers. This research led to the achievement of a brilliant microwave-absorbing material by treating pampas as biomass. The carbon-based microfibers attained by biowaste were treated by plasma under diverse environments to amplify their microwave-absorbing features. Moreover, a pyrolysis scenario was performed to compare the results. The reductive processes were performed by H2 plasma and carbonization. However, the CO2 plasma was performed to regulate the heteroatoms and defects. Interestingly, polystyrene (PS) was applied as a microwave-absorbing matrix. The aromatic rings existing in the absorbing medium establish electrostatic interactions, elevating interfacial polarization, and physical characteristics of PS augment the practical applications of the final product. The manipulated biomasses were characterized by Raman, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and diffuse reflection spectroscopy analyses. Eventually, the microwave-absorbing features were estimated by a vector network analyzer. The plasma-treated pampas under H2/Ar blended with PS gained a maximum RL of &#8722;90.65 dB at 8.79 GHz and an efficient bandwidth (RL &#8804; &#8722;10 dB) of 4.24 GHz with a thickness of 3.20 mm; meanwhile, plasma treatment under CO2 led to a maximum RL of 97.99 dB at 14.92 GHz and an efficient bandwidth of 7.74 GHz with a 2.05 mm thickness. Particularly, the biomass plasmolyzed under Ar covered the entire X and Ku bands with a thickness of 2.10 mm. Notably, total shielding efficiencies of the treated bioinspired materials were up to &#8776;99%, desirable for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Sustainable use of magnesite mine waste in self-compacting concrete and its study on strength, microstructure, cost and CO2 emission</title>

      <description>Pitchiah Raman Shunmuga Vembu, Arun Kumar, Materials research express. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399163449

                Abstract Managing waste materials from mining is of universal interest owing to its massive volume, ecological impacts, health hazards, and disposal challenges despite high operational costs. Advancements advocate for recycling mine waste to sustainably support construction. As the construction sector heavily consumes resources, utilizing mine waste from magnesite mines (MMW) in concrete has gained attention. This experimental study assesses the viability of substituting MMW for natural fine and coarse aggregates in self-compacting concrete (SCC) at intervals of 10% up to 50% by weight. Evaluations were done on fresh (slump flow, T50 slump, V-funnel, J-ring, L-box) and hardened (compressive, splitting tensile, and flexural strength) properties, along with microstructural features, cost, and CO2 emissions. The findings unveil that nearly all mixtures exhibit commendable performance, where mine waste is replaced for fine and coarse aggregates showcasing superior fresh and hardened properties, respectively. Fresh property results reveal the SF1 flow category with VF1 and VF2 viscosity types for the SCC mixtures. Moreover, these SCC mixtures observed substantial strength enhancements of approximately 10% to 15% in compressive, splitting tensile and flexural test results at 28 and 90 days. Microstructural analysis corroborates the observed strength outcomes, indicating a denser concrete matrix. Significant environmental and economic benefits were observed, including a notable 20% reduction in CO2 emissions and 17% cost savings. These findings underscore the potential of integrating MMW into SCC mixtures as a sustainable approach towards construction materials, offering both performance and environmental advantages.</description>

      <title>Decarbonizing polyamide textile production in China: Footprints and mitigation pathways from life cycle perspective</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2024.107705</link>

                Escalating demand for textiles has led to the entire supply chain contributing 8 % of global GHGs emissions. However, the carbon footprint (CF) and low carbon pathways of polyamide textile production remain ambiguous. Herein the CF of polyamide textile in China is evaluated using a "cradle to gate" life cycle system boundary allowing for comparison with other textile categories. To explore low carbon pathways of polyamide textile production, we introduce four groups of measures resulting in 12 scenarios. The CF of 1 kg polyamide textile is 35.37 kg CO2-eq, 1.38 and 3.91 times that of polyester and cotton textiles, respectively. Direct emissions from energy combustion, and indirect emissions from raw materials and energy production contribute 43.87 % and 56.13 % of the total CF. Emission reduction potentials vary from 51.37 % to 88.52 % across scenarios. These explored low carbon pathways should serve as references for achieving low and net zero emissions in the textile sector.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Integrated Energy Systems Based on Two-Step Decoupling Method</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics13112045</link>
      <description>Linyang Zhang, Jianxiang Guo, Xinran Yu, Gang Hui, Na Liu&#8206;, Dongdong Ren, Jijin Wang, Electronics. 13(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398782705

                An integrated energy system (IES) plays a key role in transforming energy consumption patterns and solving serious environmental and economic problems. However, the abundant optional schemes and the complex coupling relationship among each piece of equipment make the optimization of an IES very complicated, and most of the current literature focuses on optimization of a specific system. In this work, a simulation-based two-step decoupling method is proposed to simplify the optimization of an IES. The generalized IES is split into four subsystems, and a two-layer optimization method is applied for optimization of the capacity of each piece of equipment. The proposed method enables fast comparison among abundant optional configurations of an IES, and it is applied to a hospital in Beijing, China. The optimized coupling system includes the gas-fired trigeneration system, the GSHP, and the electric chiller. Compared with the traditional distributed systems, the emission reduction rate of CO2 and NOX for the coupling system reaches 153.8% and 314.5%, respectively. Moreover, the primary energy consumption of the coupling system is 82.67% less than that of the traditional distributed energy system, while the annual cost is almost at the same level.</description>

      <title>Environmental and Economic Aspects of a Containership Engine Performance in Off-Design Conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app14114634</link>

                A comprehensive thermodynamic model of the marine diesel engine in combination with the operating cost assessment is used in the decision-making process regarding the selection of the most favorable slow steaming speed. The influence of the number of cylinders and sailing speed on exhaust emissions, fuel consumption and operating costs is analyzed for the case of a containership sailing on a Trans-Pacific route. The engine simulation model was used for the calculation of engine fuel consumption, NOX and soot emissions. The operating costs and annual income were calculated through a fuel consumption correlation. The benefit of slow steaming is shown through the comparison of calculated data with the data calculated for the six-cylinder engine and the design speed of 23 knots. The highest reduction of 67.2% in CO2 and 93.3% in NOX emissions is achieved with the seven-cylinder engine at 15 knots, but the six-cylinder engine yields the highest increase in income per route of 6.2%. To comply with the proposed regulations for GHG emissions, the sailing speed should be reduced by at least 26%, which results in a decrease in the annual income by 24% compared to the design speed.</description>

                In recent years, the global reduction in populations of the Apis mellifera species has generated a worrying deterioration in the production of essential foods for human consumption. This phenomenon threatens food security, as it reduces the pollination of vital crops, negatively affecting the health and stability of ecosystems. The three main factors generating the loss of the bee population are industrial agriculture, climate changes, and infectious diseases, mainly those of parasitic origin, such as the Varroa destructor mite. This article proposes an IoT system that uses accessible, efficient, low-cost devices for beekeepers in developing countries to monitor hives based on temperature, humidity, CO2, and TVOC. The proposed solution incorporates nine-feature aggregation as a data preprocessing strategy to reduce redundancy and efficiently manage data storage on hardware with limited capabilities, which, combined with a machine learning model, improves mite detection. Finally, an evaluation of the energy consumption of the solution in each of its nodes, an analysis of the data traffic injected into the network, an assessment of the energy consumption of each implemented classification model, and, finally, a validation of the solution with experts is presented.</description>

                This comprehensive study examines sustainable tourisms multifaceted impacts on environmental conservation, economic development, and social equity. Through a series of analytical lenses, we assess how the tourism sectors carbon footprint can be significantly reduced by adopting low-carbon transportation and energy-efficient accommodations, leading to a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions. We explore biodiversity conservation efforts enhanced by sustainable tourism practices, resulting in a 25% improvement in biodiversity indices. Water resource management strategies highlight the importance of sustainable practices in reducing water usage by up to 30%. Economically, sustainable tourism acts as a catalyst for increasing tourist spending, job creation, and ensuring long-term economic resilience, with data indicating a 20% increase in per capita tourist expenditure in destinations with sustainable certifications. Socially, the paper delves into community participation, cultural preservation, and access inclusivity, showcasing how sustainable tourism fosters community satisfaction, cultural enrichment, and equitable benefits distribution. This paper underscores sustainable tourisms role as a critical lever for achieving environmental sustainability, economic vitality, and social justice.</description>

      <title>Reasonable Planning of King County's E-bus Replacement Plan</title>

                With the increasingly intensified global warming severe air pollutions, governments all over the world have begun or is right now looking for ways to fix the problem. Among all the solutions, sustainable urban transportation system is what many governments pay attention to because of their apparent contribution to the reduction in greenhouse gases emissions and pollutants. In this passage, we focus on the exact ecology impacts the promotion of e-buses will cause. On the other hand, the potential financial burdens the transitioning processes will bring are perceived by us in order to make a decent plan for the government to implement.For the first part of constructing the model to measure the ecology impact of transition in one area, we start with the identification of King County as a metropolitan area suitable for prediction. Then we collect information and data of its local bus fleet and e-bus transitioning plan, find out the exact number of each type of buses (diesel, hybrid and electric) around these years and the emissions of corresponding buses. We use both ARIMA and Least Squares Regression to predict the number these buses in the future until the year the local government aim to complete the plan but choose the result displayed by the better one. In this case, we obtain the data for emission of carbon dioxide, oxynitride and PM10 in each year and evaluate the ecological impact. At the same time, we predict the data for the emissions later if the bus fleet keep the same and observed over 90% of decline when we compare the value after transition to the control group.Afterwards, to estimate the financial cost, we identify the main parts involved in the processes of transitioning, classify them with one group of cost for long-term and the other for short-term---that is, changed as the plan is gradually implemented. We build models for each factor we identified and use Riemann Sum to unify the long-term and short-term costs. Based on the data we predict in problem one and from the local government&#8217;s website, we easily gain the financial implications of for about 50 million dollars in King County. Through the analysis of the government&#8217;s grant in other area, we roughly verify that 50 million dollars would be an acceptable cost.Finally, in our 10-year roadmap development, we explored further into the population distribution of King County and the existing traits for public transportation. Our starting point in this article is to classify the urban pattern into four types of bus operation routes, and then define the passenger flow from high to low. At the same time, we define the total number of vehicles that need to be replaced for different types to develop transportation replacement plans. Based on our assumptions, calculate the carrying capacity of each type of bus in line with the passenger flow. Eventually, it can be proven that the total carrying capacity of the bus meets the transportation needs of all King counties. Then apply to other regions.</description>

      <title>Potential of Reusing 3D Printed Concrete (3DPC) Fine Recycled Aggregates as a Strategy towards Decreasing Cement Content in 3DPC</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17112580</link>
      <description>Szymon Skibicki, Karol Federowicz, Marko Hoffmann, Mehdi Chougan, Daniel Sibera, Krzysztof Cendrowski, Mateusz Techman, Jo&#65533;&#227;o Pacheco, Maxime Liard, Pawe&#322; Sikora, Materials. 17(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399042629

                This paper explores the new potential strategy of using fine recycled aggregates (fRA) derived from waste 3D printed concrete (3DPC) as a substitute for cement in additive manufacturing. This study hypothesizes that fRA can optimize mixture design, reduce cement content, and contribute to sustainable construction practices. Experimental programs were conducted to evaluate the fresh and hardened properties, printability window, and buildability of 3DPC mixes containing fRA. Mixes with replacement rates of cement with fRA by 10 vol%, 20 vol%, 30 vol%, 40 vol%, and 50 vol% were produced. A comprehensive experimental protocol consisting of rheological studies (static and dynamic yield stress), dynamic elastic modulus determination (first 24 h of hydration), flexural and compressive strengths (2 d and 28 d), and an open porosity test was performed. The obtained results were verified by printing tests. In addition, an economic and environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) of the mixes was performed. The results indicate that up to 50 vol% cement replacement with fRA is feasible, albeit with some technical drawbacks. While fRA incorporation enhances sustainability by reducing CO2 emissions and material costs, it adversely affects the printability window, green strength, setting time, and mechanical properties, particularly in the initial curing stages. Therefore, with higher replacement rates (above 20 vol%), potential optimization efforts are needed to mitigate drawbacks such as reduced green strength and buildability. Notably, replacement rates of up to 20 vol% can be successfully used without compromising the overall material properties or altering the mixture design. The LCA analysis shows that reducing the cement content and increasing the fRA addition results in a significant reduction in mix cost (up to 24%) and a substantial decrease in equivalent CO2 emissions (up to 48%). In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of fRA as a sustainable alternative to cement in 3D printed concrete.</description>

      <title>Can We Reverse Global Warming?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.31223/x5368f</link>
      <description>Vincent Dert, EarthArXiv (California Digital Library). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399012135

                Without mitigation, Climate Change is expected to costs large amounts of money, cause vast amounts of human suffering and death and threatens the survival of countless species. Rising global temperatures alone are expected to cause a drop in GDP of 30 &#8211; 70% for many countries with already high temperatures. In combination with other factors (population growth, increasing water stress, coastal flooding, loss of coastal land, increasing forest fires, loss of wildlife areas and insufficient wild-life corridors), Climate Change could lead to a collapse in ecosystem services, estimated at almost twice the global GDP. For humans, these combined factors would increase poverty, famine, starvation and cause mass migration. Under the Paris Accord, countries agreed to limit Climate Change to 1.5 degrees. This limit was not set because it was a &#8220;safe&#8221; for biodiversity or humanity, but because lower limits were considered &#8220;unachievable&#8221;. However, a relatively quick reversal of global warming would minimize all damages that would occur over the next centuries under Climate Change. Besides the return to pre-industrial atmospheric conditions, minimizing loss of human lives and minimizing damage to wildlife areas and the biodiversity these represent, this would also allow a gradual restoration of mountain snow and ice caps, restoring melt water flows, reduce water stress and minimize coastal flooding. Governments treat the changes needed to transition to a carbon neutral world as &#8220;costs&#8221; instead of &#8220;investments&#8221;. Here I show how the use of renewable energy (especially roof PV solar), ground source heat pumps and electric cars combined with massive application of direct air capture and sequestration of CO2 (DACCS) can reverse global warming in 40 to 60 years while saving massive amounts of money (about 3.62% of GDP). A critical element in doing this is the use of the Impacts Measurement and Conservation System (IMACS) as the business model. The IMAC system puts consumers, retailers and organizations in general in charge of selling and buying incrementally less damaging and more sustainable products and services, while being rewarded for their actions. Under IMACS, current and historic damaging impacts are calculated and assigned to participating products, services and individual labor. For participating sellers, damaging impacts and associated sustainabilities are accurately calculated per product and service per sales location (and daily adjusted) using automated and low costs methods. For non-participating competitor products, the impacts cannot be calculated accurately and are set to the statistic upper damage limit for each damage type for the product group. Sellers who start participation will therefore almost always see large reductions in damaging impacts and large increases in reported sustainabilities for their products and services. This could dramatically accelerate the rate of change towards a sustainable world. Participation in IMACS is voluntary and cost-free for individuals. In order for products to become (more) sustainable, damaging impacts like greenhouse gas emissions must be eliminated or must be offset by CO2 sequestered in permanent storage locations. For the society as a whole, becoming carbon neutral saves large amounts of money compared to not doing so, even when the costs of CO2 sequestration are included. Under IMACS, the purchase of neutralizing amounts of sequestered CO2 are paid for during the product purchase with an electronic voucher provided by the retailer. This only applies to participating products and services sold by participating retailers to participating customers. For a 40-year global warming reversal period, the average DACCS costs for the base and conservative DACCS cost scenarios are respectively 0.65 &#8211; 1.78% of GDP, but drop to 0.26 &#8211; 0.73% of GDP over 100 years. For carbon neutral sellers, the average DACCS costs (neutralizing historic emissions) are 0.92 &#8211; 2.56% of sale, but reach 1.58 &#8211; 4.39% of sale for the peak year. The ratio of cumulative energy cost savings over cumulative DACCS costs for a 40-year global warming reversal are 1.6 - 4.4 over the 40-year period and 4.5 &#8211; 12.4 over 100-year. Early participating sellers will receive all or most of these savings. Since under IMACS, the saving from carbon neutral operations throughout the supply chain go hand in hand with the DACCS payments for remaining and historical CO2 emissions, the DACCS costs can be paid out of the savings from carbon neutral operations. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the DACCS industry, as needed to reverse global warming, is in line with the currently expected CAGR for the DACCS industry between 2023 and 2032 (42 &#8211; 70% on production basis). A 63% growth rate under default model conditions maintained for 26 years would lead to global warming reversal in model year 41. By participating in IMACS, individuals and organizations can eliminate current CO2 emissions, neutralize historic CO2 emissions, save money and improve their competitive position. Becoming sustainable can be simplified from a political to a marketing challenge. IMACS, by assigning the costs of conservation (protection and restoration) to individuals and organizations responsible for the damage done, can effectively address and solve the classic &#8220;tragedy of the commons&#8221;.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Influence of Driving Style on Energy Consumption of a Hybrid Vehicle in High-Altitude Environments During Standardized Driving Cycles</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-58950-8_1</link>

                This article analyzes the influence of driving maneuvers on a hybrid vehicle's energy consumption and emission rates. Employing data collected through OBD II and GPS technologies, route variables are meticulously documented following the EURO 6 standard, primarily for assessing pollutant levels within a Real Driving Emissions (RDE) cycle, facilitated by the use of a Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS). Throughout the study, we identify key variables that exhibit the strongest correlation with fuel consumption, including Longitudinal acceleration (Ax), Torque, Accelerator pedal open position (APS), and engine speed (RPM). These variables enable us to discern the Internal Combustion Engine's (ICE) operational conditions and devise a model that accurately estimates the rate of fuel consumption change concerning vehicle acceleration. Furthermore, we classify driving modes as ecological, RDE, or aggressive based on the State of Charge (SOC) of the vehicle. Our findings reveal that the type of driving conducted on the road and city altitude directly influence fuel consumption and emission factors (CO2, CO, HC, and NOx). Notably, we observe a remarkable 31.36% reduction in fuel consumption during ecological driving compared to aggressive driving.</description>

      <title>Cold spells over Greenland during the mid-Pliocene Warm Period</title>

                Abstract The fate of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) under global warming stress is still unascertained. From this viewpoint, GIS conditions during the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP; 3.264-3.025 Ma), an interval often referred to as a close analogue of a near-future warmer globe, deserve special attention. Neodymium (Nd) and lead (Pb) isotope signatures of marine sediment cored off the southern Greenland margin record intense glacial erosion pulses on southern Greenland Precambrian terranes during this interval, accompanied by a strong reduction of deep contour currents, and following a near obliquity cycle (~ 41 ka) pacing. Despite the high atmospheric CO2 concentration (~ 400 ppmV) of the mPWP, cold spells were thus strong enough to allow for active ice growth over Greenland. The mPWP interval was marked by a reduced amplitude in the axial tilt oscillation of the Earth, thus low overall summer insolation conditions at high latitudes, a feature not anticipated in the near future. Therefore, if offering analogies with the near future of the Earth's climate, the mPWP interval cannot be seen as a genuine analogue specifically for predicting the fate of the GIS.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Hybrid Power-Heating System in a Single-Family Building, along with Ecological Aspects of the Operation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17112601</link>
      <description>Grzegorz Woroniak, J. Piotrowska-Woroniak, Anna Woroniak, E. Owczarek, K. Giza, Energies. 17(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399083477

                This study evaluates a hybrid heating system in a single-family building in northeastern Poland, which has a temperate continental climate. The analysis covers two heating seasons in 2021/2022 and 2022/2023. The hybrid heating system includes an air heat pump HPA&#8211;08 CS Plus with a heating power of 8.2 kW (AHP), a condensing gas boiler VC146/5&#8211;5 with a power of 14 kW (GB&#8211;Condens.), and a solid fuel boiler with a power of 11 kW for central heating. Additionally, hot water is heated by a Basic 270 (DHW&#8217;s AHP) air&#8211;water heat pump with a power of 2 kW, utilizing a tank with a capacity of 270 dm3 equipped with two heating coils. The building&#8217;s average electricity consumption is around 5400 kWh/year. A 4.96 kWp photovoltaic installation is installed on the building&#8217;s roof at a 40&#176; angle towards the south to supplement the hybrid system. The study aims to assess whether the PV installation can adequately cover the energy needs of the hybrid heat source for heating and hot water. Furthermore, the study calculates the emission of pollutants (CO2, SOx, NOx, CO, and PM10) into the atmosphere. The total annual electricity production from PV installations was 5444.9 kWh in 2021/2022 and 5684.8 kWh in 2022/2023. The excess electricity was stored in the PGE power grid as per the Prosumer settlement rules. The installed PV installation is sufficient to power the following devices annually: AHP, DHW&#8217;s AHP, and GB&#8211;Condens. However, the daily electricity production from the PV installation is not enough to cover the energy needs of the heat pump for heating during the cold months in Poland (I&#8211;III, XI&#8211;XII). It can meet the power needs of a PC all year round and can also be stored during the summer months, for example, in energy warehouses or by directly storing it in the PGE power grid. The use of the PV installation resulted in an average reduction in pollutant emissions into the atmosphere: CO2&#8212;94.1%, SOx&#8212;91.8%, NOx&#8212;95.6%, CO&#8212;9.7%, and PM10&#8212;32.1%.</description>

      <title>Reuse of Steel Residue in Polypropylene Matrices for the Production of Plastic Wood, Aiming at Decarbonization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114505</link>
      <description>Let&#237;cia Santos Ribeiro, Ana L&#250;cia Nazareth da Silva, Mayara Am&#225;rio, Carina Mariane Stolz, Assed Haddad, Dieter Boer, Sustainability. 16(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399055244

                According to a 2024 World Economic Forum survey, climate change is the primary concern for the future. To address these challenges, adaptation measures and actions to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions are necessary. Emissions from the waste management sector rank as the seventh-largest contributor to global emissions. Efforts are underway to decarbonize steel processes and promote waste reuse. &#8220;Fluff&#8221;, generated during ferrous scrap processing, poses reuse challenges due to its characteristics. This study evaluates the production of wood&#8211;plastic composites using polypropylene and &#8220;Fluff&#8221; to address environmental concerns and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Methodologically, waste characterization preceded the extrusion of waste and polypropylene blends at varying compositions. The resulting materials were pelletized, molded, and characterized. CO2 emission reductions from waste diversion from landfills were assessed under two scenarios. In Scenario 1, emissions totaled 19,054 tons/year, while in Scenario 2, with gas capture and utilization, emissions reached 10,617 tons/year for 20,000 tons of waste annually. Composite characterization revealed favorable properties, suggesting viability for wood&#8211;plastic production. This approach supports industrial decarbonization and circular economy initiatives in the steel sector.</description>

      <title>Modulation of mitochondrial dynamism in kupffer cells impacts systemic metabolism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvae088.196</link>
      <description>F Fantini, Lorenzo Da Dalt, Annalisa Moregola, G B Vingiani, Monika Svecla, O. Terenghi, J. Nour, Rachele Bellini, Fabrizia Bonacina, Giuseppe Danilo Norata, Cardiovascular research. 120(Supplement_1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399136236

                Abstract Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources: Public Institution(s). Main funding source(s): University of Milan Background Kupffer Cells (KC) are hepatic resident macrophages that are essential for liver physiology and contribute to the development of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The liver of patients with NAFLD shows different expression of some key regulators of inner mitochondrial membrane fusion compared with healthy subjects, including OPA1 protein, which is a mitochondrial protein whose activity promotes mitochondrial fusion and positive modulation of oxidative phosphorylation. Aim Given that Kupffer Cells have both immune and metabolic roles, their mitochondria are critical for their and energy requirements and their functionality. This project aims to study how the inhibition of OPA1-driven mitochondrial fusion affects immune-metabolic response and progression of NAFLD by exploring the role of OPA1 in both a Standard and High-fat diet context. Methods mice selectively lacking OPA1 in Kupffer Cells were fed with either a Standard diet or a High-fat diet for 20 weeks. The metabolic phenotype was assessed by in vivo indirect calorimetry, measurement of plasma and tissue lipid profile, glucose and insulin sensitivity assays, and complete immunophenotype characterization. Single cell RNA sequencing was also performed to profile with higher resolution the impact of OPA1 deficiency on Kupffer Cell function and cross talk with other liver cells types within the hepatic niche. Results Under Standard diet conditions mice selectively lacking OPA1 in Kupffer Cells show a significant reduction in the KC1 pro-inflammatory subset, while the pro-resolutive KC2 increases significantly. In addition, mice lacking OPA1 in KCs show a metabolic preference towards carbohydrates, despite comparable energy expenditure, O2 consumption and CO2 production. The systemic immune profile was comparable between the two groups, with an expected reduction in KC total number under High-fat diet conditions, where no significant differences were observed between the two groups in plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, while a significant reduction in liver fibrosis was observed with liver histology. Conclusions Taken together these preliminary data suggest that OPA1-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial fusion in Kupffer Cells affects the systemic metabolic response under Standard diet with a reflection also on High-fat diet conditions, where systemic metabolism is comparable between the two groups, but the loss of OPA1 appears to influence the progression of NAFLD through a reduction in total liver fibrosis. Ongoing studies aim to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these different immune-metabolic responses.</description>

      <description>Mohsen Lashgari, CRC Press eBooks. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399141123

                Semiconductor photoelectrochemistry (SPEC) is a sub-discipline of physical electrochemistry that deals with the basics of semiconductors and their application for effective harnessing of light and generating electron/hole pairs (reducing/oxidizing agents) inside a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell/reactor to perform desired redox processes. These semiconductor-based electrochemical systems have found widespread applications, among which we can highlight semiconductor-assisted water photosplitting to produce hydrogen fuel and oxygen gas. This process can also be conducted in the presence of atmospheric molecules such as N2 or CO2, with the aim of their fixation, reduction (hydrogenation), and production of H-based fuels and strategic chemicals like ammonia, methanol, and oxygenates. Beyond technological importance in producing green fuels and photosynthesis of valuable materials, SPEC has found emerging applications in environmental remediation, including degradation of pollutants such as organic dyes/antibiotics/pesticides, organosulfurs, SOx, and H2S hazmat. Herein, we fundamentally address the matter of SPEC and explain how redox processes can occur in a PEC system without consuming electricity. This book chapter covers the application of semiconductors in both powdery and thin-film forms. It also describes how a semiconductor photoelectrode (SPE) can be utilized in a single- or two-electrode setup, and its activity can be easily altered by applying faradaic or electrostatic biases.</description>

      <title>Advancement of Concrete by Partially Replacing Cement by Zeolite &amp;amp; Fine Aggregate by Glass Powder</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202452901037</link>
      <description>A. Johnson Santhosh, Abhijith Shinoji, Arunkumar Jayakumar, G. J., A. Raj, E3S web of conferences. 529(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399130311

                Using glass powder for partially replacing of fine aggregate in concrete helps to reduce the demand for natural resources like sand, promote recycling of glass waste and enhance the overall strength and durability of concrete, it can also improve the thermal and sound insulation properties of concrete. Zeolite is a naturally occurring mineral that can enhance the properties of concrete, and increase its strength and durability. It can also help with reducing the carbon footprint of concrete production. By partially replacing cement with zeolite, we can reduce the amount of cement needed, which in turn reduces the carbon emissions associated with cement production. Zeolite is a type of porous mineral that has unique properties, making it a potential substitute for cement in concrete production. When zeolite is used as supplementary cementitious material, it improves strength and durability of the concrete while reducing its environmental impact. This property helps to improve the workability of the mix and enhance the hydration process of cement. Additionally, zeolite can contribute to the formation of additional cementitious materials, which can further enhance the durability and strength of the concrete. By partially replacing cement with zeolite, we can reduce the overall amount of cement used in concrete production. Manufacturing of cement is a main source of co2 emissions, this reduction can help to mitigate the environmental impact of concrete manufacturing.</description>

      <title>The Electric Vehicle Market in Brazil: A Systematic Literature Review of Factors Influencing Purchase Decisions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114594</link>
      <description>Marceli Adriane Schvartz, Amanda Lange Salvia, Luciana Brandli, Walter Leal Filho, Lucas Veiga &#195;&#129;vila, Sustainability. 16(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399176718

                Technological advancement has propelled global economic growth, but it has also led to high rates of pollution emissions, underscoring the urgency of environmental issues. The transportation sector, particularly the rise in individual vehicle ownership, significantly contributes to atmospheric pollution. In this context, Brazil faces growing challenges, largely due to the high number of individual motor vehicles. Transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs) is seen as a sustainable alternative to reduce emissions of polluting gases. However, it is important to consider that EVs may indirectly generate pollution due to energy production in thermal power plants. Nevertheless, EVs are often sought by countries to reduce dependence on imported fuels and to mitigate urban pollution. This study aims to understand the factors influencing the purchase decision of EVs in Brazil through a systematic literature review and validation by specialists using the fuzzy Delphi method. The results indicate 37 variables, grouped into five main blocks: psychological factors, performance factors, environmental factors, barriers, and prospects for the automotive sector. The validation of these variables by specialists provides a solid foundation for the next stage of the research, which involves administering the questionnaire to the general community. Considering these results will lead to strategies aimed at promoting EV adoption, in line with global sustainability challenges and the reduction in CO2 emissions.</description>

      <title>Part 1&#9472;Impact of Pyrolysis Temperature and Wood Particle Length on Vapor Cracking and Char Porous Texture in Relation to the Tailoring of Char Properties</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.4c00937</link>

                Pore size distribution is a key parameter in the performance of biobased pyrolytic char in novel applications. In industrial-scale production, the size of feedstock particles typically exceeds a few millimeters. For such particle sizes, it is a challenge to tailor the final properties of the char based only on the process conditions (experimental and modeling-wise). Pyrolysis studies of single particles larger than a few millimeters provide data sets useful for modeling and optimization of the process. Part 1 of this research focused on the pyrolysis of single particles of beech wood, secondary cracking, and its effect on the char porous texture. It contains a quantitative assessment of the effects of five conversion temperatures (from 300 to 840 &#176;C) and two particle dimensions (&#216;8 &#215; 10 mm and &#216;8 &#215; 16 mm) on the composition of the pyrolysis vapors and pore morphology of the char. Results from real-time temperature and mass changes are presented along with release profiles of 15 vapor constituents measured by infrared spectroscopy. Furthermore, characterization of the collected bio-oil (using GC-MS/FID) and the textural hierarchical structured char (through N2 and CO2 adsorption, Hg porosimetry, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)) was performed. Cracking of vapors above 500 &#176;C was compound-specific. The polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) yield, between 680 and 840 &#176;C, increased 5 times for 10 mm particles and 9 times for 16 mm ones. Besides temperature, PAH yield was suspected to correlate with particle length and PAHs/soot deposition in the micropores. Results showed that the macropores accounted for over 80% of the total pore volume, regardless of the temperature and particle length. Increasing the particle length by 60% caused a reduction in the specific surface area (ca. 15% at 840 &#176;C) of the resulting char, mainly due to a reduction in microporosity. Based on the findings, the production conditions for a specific char application are suggested. The obtained data will be used in Part 2 of this research, devoted to subsequent CFD modeling of the process.</description>

      <title>Global Trade of Green Iron as a Game Changer for a Near-Zero Global Steel Industry? - a Scenario-Based Assessment of Regionalized Impacts</title>

                The currently most promising approach for reducing CO2 emissions of the global steel production is reducing iron ore in shaft furnaces with (green) hydrogen instead of blast furnaces. Unlike to the liquid iron produced in blast furnaces, the direct reduced iron produced in this route (green iron) exists in a solid state and can be transported at reasonable costs over long distances. This allows for spatial decoupling of the iron reduction step from the steelmaking step and may lead to global trade in green iron as a new intermediate product in the steelmaking value chain. This article assesses the potential impact of a global green iron trade in terms of shifting energy demand between regions and in regarding global costs by comparing two scenarios for a global near-zero GHG steel industry: one assuming strict regional co-location of green iron and steel production and one assuming global green iron trade and associated relocation of iron production. In the Green Iron Trade scenario, 21% of global crude steel is produced from traded green iron in 2050. More than 26 Mt/a of hydrogen consumption is relocated to global "sweet spots", resulting in cost savings of 3.9% of the global annual production costs, which can provide important support for the development of net zero steel production. Enablers and barriers for global green iron trade are discussed.</description>

      <title>Initial formaldehyde generation as a predictive marker for long-term stability of Ni-rich Li-ion batteries under abusive conditions</title>

                Electrolyte decomposition significantly impacts the long-term stability of Li-ion batteries, generating liquid and gaseous byproducts. This study focuses on formaldehyde formation, a critical byproduct from CO2 reduction in Ni-rich Li-ion batteries. Through experimental and computational analyses, formaldehyde emerges from carbonate-based electrolyte decomposition. Examining overcharge, over-discharge, and fast charging conditions, formaldehyde concentration sharply increases under overcharge, indicating severe electrolyte breakdown, while over-discharge shows a gradual rise. Fast charging similarly elevates formaldehyde levels, underscoring the link between electrolyte decomposition and abusive conditions. Importantly, this research proposes utilizing formaldehyde concentration from the initial cycle as a predictive marker for assessing long-term Ni-rich Li-ion battery stability trends. Elevated initial formaldehyde indicates potential capacity fade and accelerated degradation, enabling proactive mitigation strategies. The study elucidates mechanisms governing formaldehyde formation, providing a foundation for developing electrolyte formulations and electrode materials with enhanced decomposition resistance and improved stability. This investigation contributes to the fundamental understanding of electrolyte decomposition in Ni-rich Li-ion batteries and presents a novel approach to predicting long-term performance based on initial formaldehyde measurements, advancing high-performance and reliable energy storage solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantification and mitigation of bottom-trawling impacts on sedimentary organic carbon stocks in the North Sea</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2547-2024</link>
      <description>Lucas Porz, Wenyan Zhang, Nils Christiansen, Jan Kossack, Ute Daewel, Corinna Schrum, Biogeosciences. 21(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399089377

                Abstract. The depletion of sedimentary organic carbon stocks by the use of bottom-contacting fishing gear and the potential climate impacts resulting from remineralization of the organic carbon to CO2 have recently been heavily debated. An issue that has remained unaddressed thus far regards the fate of organic carbon resuspended into the water column following disturbance by fishing gear. To resolve this, a 3D-coupled numerical ocean sediment macrobenthos model is used in this study to quantify the impacts of bottom trawling on organic carbon and macrobenthos stocks in North Sea sediments. Using available information on vessel activity, gear components, and sediment type, we generate daily time series of trawling impacts and simulate 6 years of trawling activity in the model, as well as four management scenarios in which trawling effort is redistributed from areas inside to areas outside of trawling closure zones. North Sea sediments contained 552.2&#177;192.4 kt less organic carbon and 13.6&#177;2.6 % less macrobenthos biomass in the trawled simulations than in the untrawled simulations by the end of each year. The organic carbon loss is equivalent to aqueous emissions of 2.0&#177;0.7 Mt CO2 each year, roughly half of which is likely to accumulate in the atmosphere on multi-decadal timescales. The impacts were elevated in years with higher levels of trawling pressure and vice versa. Results showed high spatial variability, with a high loss of organic carbon due to trawling in some areas, while organic carbon content increased in nearby untrawled areas following transport and redeposition. The area most strongly impacted was the heavily trawled and carbon-rich Skagerrak. Simulated trawling closures in planned offshore wind farms (OWFs) and outside of core fishing grounds (CFGs) had negligible effects on net sedimentary organic carbon, while closures in marine protected areas (MPAs) had a moderately positive impact. The largest positive impact arose for trawling closures in carbon protection zones (CPZs), which were defined as areas where organic carbon is both plentiful and labile and thereby most vulnerable to disturbance. In that scenario, the net impacts of trawling on organic carbon and macrobenthos biomass were reduced by 29 % and 54 %, respectively. These results demonstrate that carbon protection and habitat protection can be combined without requiring a reduction in net fishing effort.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the quality of products from slow pyrolysis of an agro-industrial biomass waste with natural mineral additives</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2024.118798</link>

Nigam, Alejandro Montesinos&#8208;Castellanos, Alberto Mendoza, Industrial crops and products. 216(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398793103

                Given the increasing demand for sustainable energy sources and the need to revalorize agro-industrial waste, this work presents the slow pyrolysis of a widely available agro-industrial biomass waste (pecan nut shells) in the presence of natural mineral additives such as dolomite, natural zeolite (clinoptilolite), and limestone (calcium carbonate), with a focus on elucidating the impact of the natural additives on increasing the quality of the pyrolysis products. In addition, the effect of a simple additive pretreatment (calcination) has been evaluated to develop an insight into its influence on the pyrolysis reaction. Slow pyrolysis of pecan nut shells was conducted using a lab-scale batch reactor, from room temperature to 600&#176;C with a heating rate of 10 &#176;C/min; the resulting products were collected and characterized with several instruments such as GC-MS and GC-TCD. Additive calcination caused chemical phase changes, a significant loss of total acid sites, reduction of surface area (except for calcined limestone), and elimination of micropores. A remarkable increase in the condensate product yield between 42% and 114% was observed for most tests where additives were used. Further investigation using GC-MS revealed that guaiacol and dimethoxyphenol were the primary products in the liquid phase, which underwent more pronounced deoxygenation when calcined additives were present in the pyrolysis tests, favoring the generation of organic derivatives (such as phenol, cresol, and xylenol) along with other molecules with low oxygen content. Calcined limestone showed the highest solid yield compared with the rest of the additives at the expense of liquid production. Furthermore, the presence of additives favored higher content of H2, CH4, CO and CO2 in the gas products compared with the control test; the calcined limestone additive promoted the highest hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide concentrations in the gas due to CO2 adsorption and mineralization, along with the enhancement of other reactions such as bio-oil decarbonylation, catalytic cracking and the Boudouard reaction. In turn, the H2/CO ratio obtained with this additive was also the highest, with a value of 1, making it a promising candidate for syngas-production applications. Overall, the present study contributes valuable insight into the utilization of pecan nut shells to produce fuel precursor molecules and other value-added products, emphasizing the impact of mineral additives on the pyrolysis outcome. Our findings suggest a potential alternative for the revalorization of overlooked agroindustrial byproducts, contributing to the development of more sustainable energy sources.</description>

      <title>Learning from data to improve asphalt road construction processes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/matecconf/202439602003</link>
      <description>C. H. W&#246;rner, Ulrike St&#246;ckert, MATEC web of conferences. 396(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398771682

                Asphalt road construction projects pose a lot of challenges in different disciplines, from the choice of construction methods, type and quantity of machines and personnel, pre-planning of all processes, ordering material from asphalt mixing plants, real-time logistics of handling material transport, and the asphalt paving and compaction process itself. Depending on the complexity and size of the construction site, preparation and execution can be influenced by a lot of unknown variables, like weather impact, material properties of the delivered asphalt or delays in the deliveries themselves. These circumstances might lead to irregularities in the asphalt material temperatures and thus suboptimal conditions for compaction or even construction stoppage - in any case, they lead to a reduction in quality of the built asphalt road. In recent years, a lot of mobile devices, sensors and software have been emerging as viable solutions in the construction industry to digitize and support these processes. Those real-time applications allow deeper insight into logistics or material properties on site and acquire data for downstream analysis. These endeavours in process optimization now benefit construction companies to increase efficiency, and for work safety and environmental aspects, it is crucial to optimize energy and CO2 consumption. Improved logistics and building roads with low-temperature asphalt will have to become a standard in road construction. The present study gives an overview of the digitalized processes in asphalt road construction with market-available solutions focusing on logistics data of the material delivery chain from mixing plant to paver, thermal imaging data of the built asphalt to validate asphalt temperatures, as well as machine and location data from asphalt paver and compaction rollers.</description>

      <title>Nonthermal plasma removal of CH4-NOx under LNG engine exhaust environment: Experiment, mechanism and kinetic analysis</title>

                Abstract To explore the mechanism underlying the removal of CH4 and NOx, which are typical emissions from LNG engines, through the nonthermal plasma method, aplasma chemistry model of CH4-NOx under the LNG engine exhaust environment&amp;#xD;was established in this study. Sixty key reactions affecting the conversion of CH4, CO, and NOx were determined through sensitivity analysis, and their pre-exponential factors were optimized using a genetic algorithm. The proposed model shows good performance in predicting the concentrations of CH4, CO, and NOx under the exhaust conditions of LNG engine. Then, reaction path analyses for evolution of CH4, CO, NO, and NO2 were performed under specific conditions.&amp;#xD;The results showed that CH4 mainly decomposed into CH2 that is subsequently converted into CO and CO2. CH2 is the main source for CO production. The concentration of NOx is determined by the oxidation reactions of N with O2, OH, and HO2. The specific concentration distributions of NO and NO2 were influenced by the oxidation-reduction reactions between them. Analyses of the time scales for the conversion processes of CH4, CO, and NOx were also conducted, and it was found that the reaction time scales of CH4 and CO were approximately 1&#215;10 -10 -1&#215;10 -5 s, and that was approximately 1&#215;10 -9 -1&#215;10 -4 s for NOx. Furthermore, during the overlapping period for the conversion of CH4, CO, and NOx, the NOx was dominant in the competition for O. This study provides a basis for the construction of a plasma catalytic chemistry model of CH4-NOx under LNG engine exhaust conditions.&amp;#xD;</description>

                Switzerland, a wealthy country, has a cutting-edge healthcare system, yet per capita, it emits over one ton of CO2, ranking among the world&#8217;s most polluting healthcare systems. To estimate the carbon footprint of the healthcare system of Geneva&#8217;s canton, we collected raw data on the activities of its stakeholders. Our analysis shows that when excluding medicines and medical devices, hospitals are the main greenhouse gas emitter by far, accounting for 48% of the healthcare system&#8217;s emission, followed by nursing homes (20%), private practice (18%), medical analysis laboratories (7%), dispensing pharmacies (4%), the homecare institution (3%), and the ambulance services (&lt;1%). The most prominent emission items globally are medicines and medical devices by far, accounting for 59%, followed by building operation (19%), transport (11%), and catering (4%), among others. To actively reduce Geneva&#8217;s healthcare carbon emissions, we propose direct and indirect measures, either with an immediate impact or implementing systemic changes concerning medicine prescription, building heating and cooling, low-carbon means of transport, less meaty diets, and health prevention. This study, the first of its kind in Switzerland, deciphers where most of the greenhouse gas emissions arise and proposes action levers to pave the way for ambitious emission reduction policies. We also invite health authorities to engage pharmaceutical and medical suppliers in addressing their own responsibilities, notably through the adaptation of procurement processes and requirements.</description>

      <title>Physically Structured Variational Inference for Bayesian Full Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.171691139.96106369/v1</link>
      <description>Xuebin Zhao, Andrew Curtis, Authorea (Authorea). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399075322

                Full waveform inversion (FWI) creates high resolution models of the Earth&#8217;s subsurface structures from seismic waveform data. Due to the non-linearity and non-uniqueness of FWI problems, finding globally best-fitting model solutions is not necessarily desirable since they fit noise as well as signal in the data. Bayesian FWI calculates a so-called posterior probability distribution function, which describes all possible model solutions and their uncertainties. In this paper, we solve Bayesian FWI using variational inference and propose a new methodology called physically structured variational inference, in which a physics-based structure is imposed on the variational distribution. In a simple example motivated by prior information from past FWI solutions, we include parameter correlations between pairs of spatial locations within a dominant wavelength of each other, and set other correlations to zero. This makes the method far more efficient in terms of both memory requirements and computation, at the cost of some loss of generality in the solution found. We demonstrate the proposed method with a 2D acoustic FWI scenario, and compare the results with those obtained using other methods. This verifies that the method can produce accurate statistical information about the posterior distribution with hugely improved efficiency (in our FWI example, 1 order of magnitude in computation). We further demonstrate that despite the possible reduction in generality of the solution, the posterior uncertainties can be used to solve post-inversion interrogation problems connected to estimating volumes of subsurface reservoirs and of stored CO2, with minimal bias, creating a highly efficient FWI-based decision-making workflow.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impact of technical innovation on circular economy in the built environment by using cMFA-based system dynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2024.109782</link>
      <description>Ning Zhang, Karin Gruhler, Georg Schiller, Journal of building engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399141989

                The built environment plays a significant role in material consumption and CO2 emissions, necessitating a proactive shift towards a circular economy (CE). Technical innovations (TIs) are recognized as one of the key drivers in advancing the circularity of the built environment. However, the comprehensive understanding of TIs' influence on the lifecycle and metabolism of construction materials is yet to be explored. Concrete, being a vital construction material, holds particular significance in assessing the effectiveness of CE strategies in the built environment. Hence, this study develops a continuous material flow analysis-based system dynamics model to analyze the impact of TIs in concrete components and construction processes on the CE, adopting a perspective that aligns with real-world logic, thereby reducing the complexity of the dMFA method. Our findings demonstrate that the adoption of different TIs can enhance circularity and resource efficiency within the system by influencing the four circular flows (4Rs). Under stable stock conditions, the combined application of these TIs can yield a maximum reduction of 71% in inflows and prevent 65% of natural stock resource losses attributable to their influences on circular flows, as compared to the reference scenario devoid of TIs. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the scenario contributing the highest circular flows does not necessarily optimize resource savings. Therefore, when devising CE strategies, careful consideration should be given to the underlying impacts of circular flows rather than solely focusing on maximizing the flows themselves. These results, in conjunction with geographical spatial features, can guide the design of appropriate technological interventions tailored to the local built environment, thereby enhancing the efficiency of CE strategies. However, as the data utilized in this paper are derived from literature, we believe that further case studies are warranted to refine these general findings and mitigate the limitations in both quantity and quality of data, thereby enhancing their contextual relevance.</description>

                Two thermophilic spore-forming sulfate-reducing strains, 435T and 781, were isolated from oil and gas reservoirs in Western Siberia (Russia) about 50 years ago. Both strains were found to be neutrophilic, chemoorganotrophic, anaerobic bacteria, growing at 45&#8211;70 &#176;C (optimum, 55&#8211;60 &#176;C) and with 0&#8211;4.5% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0.5&#8211;1% NaCl). The major fatty acids were iso-C15:0, iso-C17:0, C16:0, and C18:0. In sulfate-reducing conditions, the strains utilized H2/CO2, formate, lactate, pyruvate, malate, fumarate, succinate, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, butyrate, valerate, and palmitate. In 2005, based on phenotypic characteristics and a 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the strains were described as &#8216;Desulfotomaculum salinum&#8217; sp. nov. However, this species was not validly published because the type strain was not deposited in two culture collections. In this study, a genomic analysis of strain 435T was carried out to determine its taxonomic affiliation. The genome size of strain 435T was 2.886 Mb with a 55.1% genomic G + C content. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA&#8211;DNA hybridization values were highest between strain 435T and members of the genus Desulfofundulus, 78.7&#8211;93.3% and 25.0&#8211;52.2%, respectively; these values were below the species delineation cut-offs (&lt;95&#8211;96% and &lt;70%). The cumulative phenotypic and phylogenetic data indicate that two strains represent a novel species within the genus Desulfofundulus, for which the name Desulfofundulus salinus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 435T (=VKM B-1492T = DSM 23196T). A genome analysis of strain 435T revealed the genes for dissimilatory sulfate reduction, autotrophic carbon fixation via the Wood&#8211;Ljungdahl pathway, hydrogen utilization, methanol and organic acids metabolism, and sporulation, which were confirmed by cultivation studies.</description>

                Thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) is an important redox reaction that markedly alters hydrocarbons in deep reservoirs. Although the major achievements that involve reaction mechanism, process, and geochemical characteristics were attained in the last 50 years, a quantitative TSR model that includes major products was not built, which restricts the understanding of the reaction mechanism and the generation process of hydrocarbons in TSR. In this study, two series of thermal simulation experiments of the TSR involving n-octadecane (n-C18) and n-dodecylbenzene (C12B) with MgSO4 and H2O in a confined gold-tube system were conducted, and all the major products in different phases, particularly oxygen-containing compounds, were quantitatively analyzed. The results indicated that the high-molecular-weight (HMW) oxygenated compounds in heavy products were predominated by ketones, followed by alcohol and acids, and the low-molecular-weight (LMW) organic acids in water mainly comprised acetic acids, followed by formic acid and propionic acid. Both oxygen-containing compounds prompted the TSR process but in different ways. The accumulation of HMW oxygenated compounds in the non-autocatalytic stages was essential for initiating the catalyzed reaction of TSR. In addition, the oxygenated compounds of hydrocarbons enhance polarity, making hydrocarbons easier to contact with HSO4&#8722; or [MgSO4] CIP. The LMW organic acids possibly prompted the TSR process by acidifying the water and thus facilitating the formation of HSO4&#8722; and [MgSO4] CIP. The oxidation reaction during TSR possibly converted HMW oxygenated compounds to LMW organic acids and CO2. The quantitative analysis of products in TSR revealed that TSR destroyed the hydrocarbons more rapidly but in a different way from thermal cracking and that the generation process of hydrocarbon types in TSR was in the following order: heavy hydrocarbon, gaseous hydrocarbon/light hydrocarbon/solid bitumen, and gaseous hydrocarbon/solid bitumen. Compared with oil cracking, the TSR promoted the oil reservoir to rapidly progress to more mature stages. The hydrocarbon precursor and reaction extent affected the generation process and the character of all products in the TSR. These results can provide an improved understanding of the TSR mechanism and process and be useful in the evaluation of petroleum potential for TSR-altered oils.</description>

                Abstract. Understanding global forest carbon stocks is necessary to assess the world&#8217;s global carbon budget, with land cover change being estimated to contribute roughly 20 % of the emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. In the last decade or so, remote sensing has contributed estimates of above ground stocks of biomass &#8211; a key part of forest carbon stocks &#8211; with over twenty biomass maps available at pan-tropical and global scales. To further the understanding of forest carbon stocks, this research seeks to synthesize the findings of disparate data sources on: (i) forest cover, (ii) forest cover change, (iii) above ground biomass (AGB) / above ground carbon (AGC) stocks in forests. Satellite-derived forest cover and AGB estimates have substantial variability. In 2020, forests were estimated to cover between 22.6 million and 49.7 million km2 of the Earth&#8217;s land surface, thus ranging from 17.1 % to 37.6 % of total land cover. Likewise, examining forest cover change from available datasets, the estimated change in global forest cover between 2000 and 2020 was loss of approximately 88,734 to 124,184 km2 per year, combined with regrowth of forest cover of approximately 58,628 to 169,912 km2 per year. Combining that forest cover data with remotely sensed AGB estimates, total stocks of AGB for the year 2000 were estimated to be 325&#8211;697 Gt, while for the year 2020, the range was 401&#8211;580 Gt. The equivalent quantity of CO2 (i.e., CO2e) of that stock of forest biomass was therefore estimated to be 560 to 1,200 Gt for the year 2000, and 692&#8211;999 Gt for the year 2020. Our analysis found that the forest cover loss in tropics was the largest, at the rate of 1.4 % to 3.5 % net reduction between 2000 and 2020, whereas for the same time period, the temperate and boreal zones showed substantially lower forest cover loss (-2.5 % to 0.5 % and 1 % to 5.3 % respectively). This synthesis paper demonstrates that there is a fairly wide range of variability in estimates related to forest cover, forest cover change, and above ground biomass stocks, which are the main inputs for estimating forest carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions from land cover change.</description>
