                Catalysts involving post&#8208;transition metals have shown almost invincible performance on generating formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Conversely, Cu without post&#8208;transition metals have struggled to achieve comparable activity. In this study, a sulfur (S)&#8208;doped&#8208;copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalyst is developed, exhibiting excellent performance in formate generation with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 92% and a partial current density of 321 mA cm&#8208;2. Ex&#8208;situ structural elucidations reveal the presence of abundant grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8208;S bonds from the covellite phase during CO2RR. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that S&#8208;S bonds can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates, further improving the activity of the formate pathway. This work is significant in modifying a low&#8208;cost catalyst (Cu) with a non&#8208;metallic substance (S) to achieve comparable performance to mainstream catalysts for formate generation in industrial grade.</description>

                Abstract To prevent global warming, various technologies are being developed to suppress carbon dioxide emissions. Nanobubbles are useful in various industrial fields. Carbon dioxide capture technology was studied using the property of activating the reaction of nanobubbles. In this study, carbon dioxide capture was attempted using nanobubble generation tubes based on the friction principle. The world has paid attention to carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) to inhibit and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which are known as the main cause of global warming. The problem is that the new process that utilizes carbon dioxide must consume less energy and resources than existing alternative processes. To address this problem, research was conducted on the possibility of dissolving carbon dioxide in large quantities at low power consumption using a nanobubble generation system and real-time chemical reactions in this study. In addition, a mass dissolution system was constructed, and real-time neutralization was verified through the reactions of nanobubble carbon dioxide with ammonia water (NH 4 OH) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2 ) solution.</description>

                Electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide into formic acid has been demonstratedas an efficient approach for closing the carbon cycle. Here, we boost the intrinsicactivity of the Bi-based electrocatalyst through the synergy of enhanced chargetransfer and mass transport process in the electrochemical reactions by generating anatomic disorder in the crystal lattices. The amorphous Bi-based quantum dots (a-BiQDs) serve as promising electrocatalysts toward formate production in a widepotential range with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) and energy efficiency (EE) in boththe conventional H-cell and flow-cell. The maximum FEs of 94.44% and 98.89% areachieved at the potential of -1.0 V vs. RHE in the H-cell and flow-cell, respectively.Furthermore, long-term stability of more than 900 hours is demonstrated in a two-electrode configuration. Combined molecular dynamics and first-principle calculationsascribe the remarkable activity toward formate production to synergistically acceleratedmass transport and charge transfer kinetics .</description>

      <title>Review of electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 on carbon supported films</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.022</link>
      <description>Afdhal Yuda, Parisa Ebrahimi, Josephine Selvaraj, Anand Kumar, Vaidyanathan Subramanian, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 57(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390721078

                Carbon capture and conversion are becoming increasingly important as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise and their adverse effects become increasingly evident. CO2 conversion/utilization-related research has gained renewed interest on a variety of platforms, including thermal, solar, biological, photochemical, and electrochemical conversions. Electrochemical routes, using suitable catalysts, are potentially suitable for commercial purposes owing to ease of integration with solvent-based carbon capture processes. This paper summarizes and evaluates the studies conducted within the past decade regarding the feasibility of carbon-based supports utilized in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. CO2 conversion has been reviewed in a number of reports, focusing on specific sections, such as metallic/bimetallic catalysts, CO2 solubility, and the fabrication of electrodes and electrochemical cells. The number of publications addressing various carbon-based electrocatalysts is increasing, but these materials have not yet been reviewed. Herein, we are focused on three types of electrocatalyst materials: metals, metal-oxides, non-oxides, and combinations thereof with carbon. The scope of this study includes the following: i) carbon-based materials and how they are characterized by distinctive properties, ii) electrocatalytic CO2 conversion techniques, and iii) research cases for carbon allotrope-supported composites used in CO2 reduction. The advancement in analytical tools that provide insight into liquid-phase reactions will benefit the development of catalysts and electrodes that will be effective in converting CO2 into the desired products. Such developments will also be applicable to other systems involving liquid electrolytes or solvents for performing reactions on catalyst surfaces.</description>

      <title>Engineering redox-active electrochemically mediated carbon dioxide capture systems</title>

                With ever-increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and commitments to limit global temperatures to less than 1.5 &#176;C above pre-industrial levels, the need for versatile, low-cost carbon dioxide capture technologies is paramount. Electrochemically mediated carbon dioxide separation systems promise low energetics, modular scalability and ease of implementation, with direct integration to renewable energy for net-negative carbon dioxide operations. For these systems to be cost-competitive, key factors around their operation, stability and scaling need to be addressed. Energy penalties associated with redox-active species transport, gas transport and bubble formation limit the volumetric productivity and scaling potential due to their cost and footprint. Here we highlight the importance of engineering approaches towards enhancing the performance of redox-active electrochemically mediated carbon dioxide capture systems to enable their widespread implementation. This Perspective discusses electrochemically mediated carbon dioxide capture systems, which can offer lower energetics than standard thermal methods, with modular scalability. New integrated configurations can further reduce costs and improve unit productivity, while further engineering of existing cell designs will enable more rapid implementation.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction by borophene supported bimetallic catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.01.051</link>
      <description>Meiling Liu, Jayaraman Balamurugan, Tongxiang Liang, Chao Liu, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390766525

                Bimetal atom catalysts (BACs) hold significant potential for various applications as a result of the synergistic interaction between adjacent metal atoms. This interaction leads to improved catalytic performance, while simultaneously maintaining high atomic efficiency and exceptional selectivity, similar to single atom catalysts (SACs). Bimetallic site catalysts (M2&#946;12) supported by &#946;12-borophene were developed as catalysts for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The research on density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that M2&#946;12 exhibits exceptional stability, conductivity, and catalytic activity. Investigating the most efficient reaction pathway for CO2RR by analyzing the Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) during potential determining steps (PDS) and choosing a catalyst with outstanding catalytic performance for CO2RR. The overpotential required for Fe2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 to generate CO is merely 0.05 V. This implies that the conversion of CO2 to CO can be accomplished with minimal additional voltage. The overpotential values for Cu2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 during the formation of HCOOH were merely 0.001 and 0.07 V, respectively. Furthermore, the Rh2&#946;12 catalyst exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 0.51 V for CH3OH and 0.65 V for CH4. The Fe2&#946;12 produces C2H4 through the *CO-*CO pathway, while Ag2&#946;12 generates CH3CH2OH via the *CO-*CHO coupling pathway, with remarkably low overpotentials of 0.84 and 0.60 V, respectively. The study provides valuable insights for the systematic design and screening of electrocatalysts for CO2RR that exhibit exceptional catalytic performance and selectivity.</description>

      <title>Comparative microwave catalytic pyrolysis of cellulose and lignin in nitrogen and carbon dioxide atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.140750</link>
      <description>Yang Liu, Chunbao Zhou, Asif Ali Siyal, Chenglong Liu, Yingwen Zhang, Jie Fu, Huimin Yun, Jianjun Dai, Xiaotao Bi, Journal of Cleaner Production. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390859703

                In this paper, a cleaner pyrolysis strategy combining microwave heating, catalyst and carbon dioxide was explored for converting biomass components into higher quality products. Catalytic pyrolysis was more favorable for the decomposition and conversion of complex biomass structures. For furfural residue pyrolysis, potassium sulfate contained in sample served as the main catalytic component. Potassium sulfate promoted the increase of phenols in bio-oil. Notably, carbon dioxide atmosphere promoted the decomposition of substances and exerted a significant effect on biomass pyrolysis, which increased bio-oil yield and declined gas yield. When the pyrolysis atmosphere was changed from nitrogen to carbon dioxide, the ID/IG ratio decreased from 1.07 to 0.74, indicating that carbon dioxide decreased defect structure in biochar. Carbon dioxide enriched the porous structure and surface roughness of biochar. Also, carbon dioxide as a carrier gas was found to be more effective than nitrogen in improving the heating values of biochar and the acidity of bio-oil under carbon dioxide was lower than that under nitrogen, which was conducive to the subsequent utilization of biochar and bio-oil. Carbon dioxide promoted the production of alcohols, alkenes, and alkanes in bio-oil. Beneficially, the interaction of cellulose and lignin inhibited the release of hydrogen chloride. At last, this study also provides insights into the mechanism of catalyst and CO2 on biomass microwave pyrolysis.</description>

      <title>Tuning Carbon Dioxide Reduction Reaction Selectivity of Bi Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts with Controlled Coordination Environments</title>

                Control over product selectivity of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a crucial challenge for the sustainable production of carbon-based chemical feedstocks. In this regard, single-atom catalysts (SACs) are promising materials due to their tunable coordination environments, which could enable tailored catalytic activities and selectivities, as well as new insights into structure-activity relationships. However, direct evidence for selectivity control via systematic tuning of the SAC coordination environment is scarce. In this work, we have synthesized two differently coordinated Bi SACs anchored to the same host material (carbon black) and characterized their CO2RR activities and selectivities. We find that oxophilic, oxygen-coordinated Bi atoms produce HCOOH, while nitrogen-coordinated Bi atoms generate CO. Importantly, use of the same support material assured that alternation of the coordination environment is the dominant factor for controlling the CO2RR product selectivity. Overall, this work demonstrates the structure-activity relationship of Bi SACs, which can be utilized to establish control over CO2RR product distributions, and highlights the promise for engineering atomic coordination environments of SACs to tune reaction pathways.</description>

      <title>Monomeric gold hydrides for carbon dioxide reduction: ligand effect on the reactivity</title>

      <description>Elisa Rossi, Diego Sorbelli, Paola Belanzoni, Leonardo Belpassi, Gianluca Ciancaleoni, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390674634

                We analyzed the ligand electronic effect in the reaction between a [LAu(I)H]0/&#8208; hydride species and CO2, leading to a coordinated formate [LAu(HCOO)]0/&#8208;. We explored 20 different ligands, such as carbenes, phosphines and others, carefully selected to cover a wide range of electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor properties. We included in the study the only ligand, an NHC&#8208;coordinated diphosphene, that, thus far, experimentally demonstrated facile and reversible reaction between the monomeric gold(I) hydride and carbon dioxide. We elucidated the previously unknown reaction mechanism, which resulted to be concerted and common to all the ligands: the gold&#8208;hydrogen bond attacks the carbon atom of CO2 with one oxygen atom coordinating to the gold center. A correlation between the ligand &#963; donor ability, which affects the electron density at the reactive site, and the kinetic activation barriers of the reaction has been found. This systematic study offers useful guidelines for the rational design of new ligands for this reaction, while suggesting a few promising and experimentally accessible potential candidates for the stoichiometric or catalytic CO2 activation.</description>

                Catalysts involving post&#8208;transition metals have shown almost invincible performance on generating formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR).

                Experimental and numerical evaluation of steam and carbon dioxide gasification on torrefied palm kernel shell in an updraft fixed bed gasifier is studied. Euler-Lagrangian two-dimensional model with 15 kinetic reactions is developed to investigate tar formation in relation to torrefaction temperature, gasification temperature, and steam-to-carbon-dioxide ratio (S-CO2-R). The combination of steam and CO2 had considerable effect on the tar reduction and also influenced the gaseous composition significantly when the varying parameters were compared. The results show that increasing both gasification temperature and S-CO2-R do enhance the H2 production whiles drastically reducing the tar formation. The tar concentration reduced by 21.4 % and 20.5 % by changing the S-CO2-R from 0.4 to 2.0 and gasification process temperature from 973 and 1173 K respectively. An increase in hydrogen is also observed, from 55.5 % to 60.84 %, when the S-CO2-R is increased to 1.2. Similarly, 29.1 % increase is observed in gasification efficiency as compared to the raw-PKS.</description>

                Controlling the valence states of copper is pivotal in determining the selectivity of products in CO2 electroreduction. In this study, we developed a Cu doped carbon catalyst (CuNC) derived from a metal-organic framework (MOFs) through a straightforward solution reaction and calcination method. The N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ sites exhibited adjustable C1 and C2 selectivity in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CER). Specifically, the CuNC-700 demonstrated an impressive C2 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 56.0% at -1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a remarkable C1 FE of 56.7% with a total current density of 600 mA/cm2 at -1.6 V vs RHE. In the entire potential range, the CuNC-700 consistently maintained high FE values of &gt; 92% for CER, while the FE values for hydrogen evolution reaction is below 8%. This study unveiled the correlation between the selectivity and the valence states of copper. At low applied potentials, the abundance of N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ sites led to the predominant production of the C2 products. The Cu0 played a primary role in activating CO2 and facilitating subsequent electron transfer, while the Cu+ enhanced the adsorption of *CO, further promoting the C-C coupling. Under high applied potentials, both Cu2+ and Cu+ were converted to Cu0, favoring the methanation process. This research paves the way for future design of Cu-based MOF-derived materials, enabling precise regulation of C1/C2 selectivity in CER.</description>

                Excessive CO2 emission has caused serious environmental problems, and converting CO2 to high value-added fuels is attractive for solving energy and environmental crisis. Herein, a novel mesoporous TS-1(mTS-1) zeolite-confined metal oxides nanoclusters Cu-Bi@mTS-1 was developed for efficient photoelectrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (PEC CO2RR). The catalyst Cu-Bi@mTS-1 as a photocathode showed high activity, achieving a maximum methanol Faraday efficiency (FECH3OH) of 93.4% at -0.7 V vs. RHE. In-situ Raman results indicate the formation of key reaction intermediates *OCH3 and *CHO during the conversion of CO2 to CH3OH. The C2 product ethanol could be also detected at higher potentials during PEC CO2RR. It is believed that the hierarchically porous structure of mTS-1 is conducive to the enrichment of CO2 molecules to increase the reactant concentration, also can promote C-C coupling through photoelectric synergism. This work provides a favorable reference for the rational design of photocathodes by confinement effect of porous structure.</description>

      <title>Design of highly selective and stable CsPbI3 perovskite catalyst for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to C1 product</title>

                Finding efficient photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction catalysts is one of the core issues in addressing global climate change. Herein, the pristine CsPbI3 perovskite and doped CsPbI3 perovskite were evaluated in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to C1 products by using density functional theory. Free energy testing and electronic structure analysis methods have shown that doped CsPbI3 exhibits more effective catalytic performance, higher selectivity, and stability than undoped CsPbI3. Additionally, it is discovered that CsPbI3 (100) and (110) crystal surfaces have varied product selectivity. The photo-catalytic effectiveness is increased by the narrower band gap of Bi and Sn doped CsPbI3, which broadens the absorption spectrum of visible light and makes electron transport easier. The calculation results indicate that Bi doped CsPbI3 (100) and CsPbI3 (110) crystal faces exhibit good selectivity towards CH4, with free energy barriers as low as 0.55 eV and 0.58 eV, respectively. Sn doped CsPbI3 (100) and CsPbI3 (110) crystal planes exhibit good selectivity for HCOOH and CH3OH, respectively. The results indicate that the Bi and Sn doped CsPbI3 perovskite catalyst can further improve the CO2 photocatalytic activity and high selectivity for C1 products, making it a suitable substrate material for high-performance CO2RR.</description>

      <title>Effect of Co2 Shortage on the Performance of Membrane Electrode Co2 Electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4695651</link>

                To mitigate greenhouse effects, carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been used as an efficient means of carbon reduction. In CO2 electrolyzer, CO2 shortage can happen and degrade the reaction efficiency. Herein, an efficient and long-lived formic acid three-cell electrolyzer is used to study the effect of CO2 shortage, by operating the electrolyzer from full CO2 supply to CO2 shortage. In addition, the effects of various CO2 fluxes and concentrations on the electrolyzer current, acid concentration and lifetime are investigated. The results demonstrated that the electrolyzer current and the CO to H2 ratio both decreases from full CO2 to CO2 shortage, indicating that the reactivity of converting CO2 into formic acid ions is weakened. On the contrary, the hydrogen evolution reaction is intensified. Long-term CO2 shortage also cause the catalyst to detach and agglomerate in the cathode catalyst layer, reducing its active surface area and overall performance. Compared with the CO2 flux, the CO2 concentration exerts a more pronounced influence. To ensure the electrolysis efficiency, the carbon dioxide concentration should not be less than 80 %.</description>

      <title>Nature AND Nurture: Enabling formate-dependent growth in Methanosarcina acetivorans</title>

                Methanogens are essential players in the global carbon cycle. Methanosarcinales possess one of the most diverse metabolic repertoires for methanogenesis, but they have never been observed to utilize formate as a substrate. We successfully reprogrammed the primary metabolism of Methanosarcina acetivorans by introducing an exogenous formate dehydrogenase derived from a closely related species. The engineered strains acquired the capacity to harness energy from formate-dependent methanogenesis pathways, including formate-dependent methyl reduction and formate-dependent carbon dioxide reduction. The ability of M. acetivorans to thrive on formate suggests the existence of essential accessory machinery and metabolic redundancy for generating reduced ferredoxins from F420H2. This remarkable plasticity in energy metabolism raises the possibility that an ancestral lineage of Methanosarcinales may have possessed the capacity to utilize formate. By combining this genetically modified strain with a disruption in methyl disproportionation, we have created a novel tool for investigating and manipulating the components of the F420 reduction and methanogenesis pathways independently.</description>

      <title>Peeking into the Femtosecond Hot-Carrier Dynamics Reveals Unexpected Mechanisms in Plasmonic Photocatalysis</title>

                Plasmonic-driven photocatalysis may lead to reaction selectivity that cannot be otherwise achieved. A fundamental role is played by hot carriers, i.e., electrons and holes generated upon plasmonic decay within the metal nanostructure interacting with molecular species. Understanding the elusive microscopic mechanism behind such selectivity is a key step in the rational design of hot-carrier reactions. To accomplish that, we present state-of-the-art multiscale simulations, going beyond density functional theory, of hot-carrier injections for the rate-determining step of a photocatalytic reaction. We focus on carbon dioxide reduction, for which it was experimentally shown that the presence of a rhodium nanocube under illumination leads to the selective production of methane against carbon monoxide. We show that selectivity is due to a (predominantly) direct hole injection from rhodium to the reaction intermediate CHO. Unexpectedly, such an injection does not promote the selective reaction path by favoring proper bond breaking but rather by promoting bonding of the proper molecular fragment to the surface.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR) is gaining momentum as an effective process to capture and convert CO 2 into valuable chemicals and fuels, as well as to contribute reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes) are increasingly attracting attention as CO 2 RR electrocatalysts due to their enhanced chemical activity and selectivity, overcoming limitations of traditional metal CO 2 RR electrocatalysts, and likely breaking the scaling relations of reaction intermediates toward the desired product. The present concept reviews the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the computational description of CO 2 RR on MXenes, going from CO 2 activation on pristine models to different surface terminations, and discuss possible ways to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity, including doping, defects, supported single metal atoms, solvent effects, and electric field effects, while putting in the spotlight prospects by including kinetic aspects.</description>

                Carbon capture and conversion are becoming increasingly important as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise and their adverse effects become increasingly evident. CO2 conversion/utilization-related research has gained renewed interest on a variety of platforms, including thermal, solar, biological, photochemical, and electrochemical conversions. Electrochemical routes, using suitable catalysts, are potentially suitable for commercial purposes owing to ease of integration with solvent-based carbon capture processes. This paper summarizes and evaluates the studies conducted within the past decade regarding the feasibility of carbon-based supports utilized in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. CO2 conversion has been reviewed in a number of reports, focusing on specific sections, such as metallic/bimetallic catalysts, CO2 solubility, and the fabrication of electrodes and electrochemical cells. The number of publications addressing various carbon-based electrocatalysts is increasing, but these materials have not yet been reviewed. Herein, we are focused on three types of electrocatalyst materials: metals, metal-oxides, non-oxides, and combinations thereof with carbon. The scope of this study includes the following: i) carbon-based materials and how they are characterized by distinctive properties, ii) electrocatalytic CO2 conversion techniques, and iii) research cases for carbon allotrope-supported composites used in CO2 reduction. The advancement in analytical tools that provide insight into liquid-phase reactions will benefit the development of catalysts and electrodes that will be effective in converting CO2 into the desired products. Such developments will also be applicable to other systems involving liquid electrolytes or solvents for performing reactions on catalyst surfaces.</description>

                This study reports the accuracy and applications of an attenuated total reflectance&#8211;surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8211;SEIRAS) technique to indirectly measure the interfacial pH of the electrolyte using the ratio of phosphate species within 10 nm of the electrocatalyst surface. This technique can be used in situ to study aqueous electrochemical reactions with a calibration range from pH 1&#8211;13, time resolution down to 4 s, and an average 95% confidence interval of 14% that varies depending on the pH region (acidic, neutral, or basic). The method is applied in this study to electrochemical nitrate reduction at a copper cathode to demonstrate its capabilities, but is broadly applicable to any aqueous electrochemical reaction (such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, or oxygen evolution) and the electrocatalyst may be any SEIRAS-active thin film (e.g., silver, gold, or copper). The time-resolved results show a dramatic increase in the interfacial pH from pH 2&#8211;7 in the first minute of operation during both constant current and pulsed current experiments where the bulk pH is unchanged. Attempts to control the pH polarization at the surface by altering the electrochemical operating conditions&#8212;lowering the current or increasing the pulse frequency&#8212;showed no significant change, demonstrating the challenge of controlling the interfacial pH.</description>

                Trees are a prominent feature of urban ecosystems. Urban tree productivity is a key component of urban ecosystem energetics and has been identified as a possible pathway for reducing global greenhouse gas concentrations. Recently, extensive research has been directed to evaluating the carbon dynamics of urban trees in cities throughout the world. Here, we synthesize this research, using results from previous studies from 154 cities to identify the distribution of urban tree productivity globally and the basis for generating urban tree productivity estimates. Reported urban tree productivity shows a strong relationship with estimated tree carbon content and exhibits increases with both temperature and precipitation, with land cover differences influencing the degree of climate sensitivity. Compared with a reference productivity estimate, urban trees showed greatly reduced estimated rates of productivity and the magnitude of reduced productivity was inversely correlated with precipitation but was independent of temperature. Reported rates of productivity across all studies suggest climate restrictions that are more important with less intensively managed land covers. Scaling these results globally suggests a limited opportunity for urban trees to contribute to atmospheric carbon dioxide reductions, especially in the absence of major carbon emission reductions. We found that the majority of results are derived from tree inventories from a single period with rates of productivity estimate through quasi-empirical or allometric models. The majority of studies have been conducted in temperate biomes and North America. These results show that existing urban tree assessments have substantial methodological restrictions and regional biases. Future research of urban tree productivity should look toward improved methods and can use this synthesis as a baseline for comparisons and improvement.</description>

                Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (ECO2RR) converts CO2 into value-added chemicals or fuels to realize carbon recycling as means to solve the problems of renewable energy shortage and environmental pollution. The development of cost-effective CO2RR catalysts with high activity, stability and selectivity is the key that enables efficient conversion from CO2 to valuable products. It is also important to understand intrinsic mechanisms of the underlying active-site that affect the performances of catalysts, which can, in turn, facilitate the rational design of more active electrocatalysts. In this context, it is particularly important to understand the structure-activity relationship of catalyst active sites during the CO2RR process from different atomic-scales, which inspires to organize this review. Specifically, we focus on the atomic-level construction of active sites from single atoms, dual-site metal, clusters, or/and graphitic carbon materials: key approaches for tailoring coordination configurations to enhance target product selectivity, i.e., optimizing the interplay between the catalytic active center and reactants or intermediates, disrupting the linear correlation of intermediate adsorption energies, and promoting intricate cascading reactions involving multiple intermediates. Highlight the intricate correlation between the structure-activity of CO2RR catalysts, which govern the discerning refinement of catalysts and propel advances in their practical application. Then, the electrocatalytic reactors for ECO2R reactions are critically reviewed. The acquisition of key metrics, the challenges faced, and the most suitable solutions for electrocatalytic CO2RR are proposed. Finally, future research directions and strategies are anticipated to inspire revolutionary advancements.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4691481</link>

                CO2 geological storage is the primary means of achieving large-scale, low-cost carbon dioxide reduction. Compared with onshore basins, sequestration in offshore basins has the advantages of larger storage volume and less impact on people and the environment. At the same time, there are also challenges such as high cost and technical difficulty for sequestration. At present, there are many researches on the selection and suitability evaluation of CCS in China, and there are also very successful demonstration applications, while the research on CO2 geological storage in sea areas is relatively few. Taking Zhuyi Depression of Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South China Sea as an example in this paper, with the goal of meeting the storage capacity of one million tons per year. Making statistics on the factors affecting the suitability of CO2 storage of oil and gas-bearing structures in the depression from three aspects: geological characteristics, storage economy and storage safety, and constructs a screening index system of CO2 geological storage field, which includes 3 levels and 18 evaluation factors. The index weight of each evaluation factor is calculated by AHP. The suitability of CO2 sealing of selected oil and gas-bearing structures is quantitatively evaluated by multi-source information overlap analysis. The results show that the Xijiang 23 and other oil-bearing structures in the west of Huizhou Sag have priority as the storage field. The results of this study can provide reference for the implementation and management decision of CO2 saline aquifers storage in this area.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction by borophene supported bimetallic catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.01.051</link>
      <description>Meiling Liu, Jayaraman Balamurugan, Tongxiang Liang, Chao Liu, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390766525

                Bimetal atom catalysts (BACs) hold significant potential for various applications as a result of the synergistic interaction between adjacent metal atoms. This interaction leads to improved catalytic performance, while simultaneously maintaining high atomic efficiency and exceptional selectivity, similar to single atom catalysts (SACs). Bimetallic site catalysts (M2&#946;12) supported by &#946;12-borophene were developed as catalysts for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The research on density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that M2&#946;12 exhibits exceptional stability, conductivity, and catalytic activity. Investigating the most efficient reaction pathway for CO2RR by analyzing the Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) during potential determining steps (PDS) and choosing a catalyst with outstanding catalytic performance for CO2RR. The overpotential required for Fe2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 to generate CO is merely 0.05 V. This implies that the conversion of CO2 to CO can be accomplished with minimal additional voltage. The overpotential values for Cu2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 during the formation of HCOOH were merely 0.001 and 0.07 V, respectively. Furthermore, the Rh2&#946;12 catalyst exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 0.51 V for CH3OH and 0.65 V for CH4. The Fe2&#946;12 produces C2H4 through the *CO-*CO pathway, while Ag2&#946;12 generates CH3CH2OH via the *CO-*CHO coupling pathway, with remarkably low overpotentials of 0.84 and 0.60 V, respectively. The study provides valuable insights for the systematic design and screening of electrocatalysts for CO2RR that exhibit exceptional catalytic performance and selectivity.</description>

      <title>Exploring the influence of interfacial solvation on electrochemical CO2 reduction using plasmon&#8208;enhanced vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy</title>

                Although interfacial solvation plays an important role in determining carbon dioxide reduction CO2 kinetics, present understanding of the potential dependent properties of the electrochemical double layer under conditions relevant for CO2R remains limited. This article summarizes the development and recent applications of plasmon&#8208;enhanced vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy to study the effects of cation hydration and interfacial solvation on CO2&#8203;R using CO as a vibrational Stark reporter. Results show that electrolyte cations retain their entire solvation shell upon adsorption to inactive sites, while active sites retain only a single water layer between the gold surface and the cation. Measurements also show that the total interfacial electric field can be separated into two contributions: one from the electrochemical double layer (Stern field) and another from the polar solvation environment (Onsager field). Surprisingly, correlating VSFG spectra with reaction kinetics reveals that it is the solvation&#8208;mediated Onsager field that governs the chemical reactivity at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Measuring the interfacial water spectra during electrocatalysis also provides evidence for the proton source during H2 evolution, which competes with CO2&#8203;R in aqueous electrolyte. These findings highlight the importance of directly probing cation hydration and interfacial solvation, which mediates reaction kinetics at electrochemical interfaces.</description>

      <title>CARBON TAX AND ITS EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY, TAXES AND ENVIRONMENT</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.56301/awl.v6i1.1013</link>
      <description>M.E. Retno Kadarukmi, Awang Long Law Review. 6(1)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4390652284

                This research discusses theoretically the relationship between carbon tax with economy, tax and environment. This research is a legal research with analytical descriptive nature, namely research that analyzes secondary data on issues related to carbon taxes as an instrument for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. According to secondary data, this research is aimed at discovering aspects of carbon tax design, collection of carbon taxes, and state management of carbon tax revenues. Carbon taxes are an effective and efficient instrument to support the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. To be implemented, a carbon tax must be feasible. Eligibility requires public acceptance. On the other hand, a carbon tax can create a lot of controversy. The main argument against carbon taxes is that carbon taxes do not always guarantee emission reductions. In addition, there are also concerns over the unintended effects of competitiveness, carbon leakage, and fears of unintended distributional impacts, which could be barriers to implementation.</description>

                China&#8217;s transition to a green, low-carbon economy is among the most essential elements needed to achieve the climate goals set down in the Paris Agreement. China has pledged it &#8220;will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060&#8221;.1 Given the currently high emissions level in China and an economic structure with significant share of industrial sector and fossil fuel consumption, it remains a formidable challenge to realize such steep emission reduction for the 30-60 goals, as we call them in this paper.</description>

      <title>Monomeric gold hydrides for carbon dioxide reduction: ligand effect on the reactivity</title>

                We analyzed the ligand electronic effect in the reaction between a [LAu(I)H]0/&#8208; hydride species and CO2, leading to a coordinated formate [LAu(HCOO)]0/&#8208;. We explored 20 different ligands, such as carbenes, phosphines and others, carefully selected to cover a wide range of electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor properties. We included in the study the only ligand, an NHC&#8208;coordinated diphosphene, that, thus far, experimentally demonstrated facile and reversible reaction between the monomeric gold(I) hydride and carbon dioxide. We elucidated the previously unknown reaction mechanism, which resulted to be concerted and common to all the ligands: the gold&#8208;hydrogen bond attacks the carbon atom of CO2 with one oxygen atom coordinating to the gold center. A correlation between the ligand &#963; donor ability, which affects the electron density at the reactive site, and the kinetic activation barriers of the reaction has been found. This systematic study offers useful guidelines for the rational design of new ligands for this reaction, while suggesting a few promising and experimentally accessible potential candidates for the stoichiometric or catalytic CO2 activation.</description>

      <title>Tuning Carbon Dioxide Reduction Reaction Selectivity of Bi Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts with Controlled Coordination Environments</title>

                Control over product selectivity of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a crucial challenge for the sustainable production of carbon-based chemical feedstocks. In this regard, single-atom catalysts (SACs) are promising materials due to their tunable coordination environments, which could enable tailored catalytic activities and selectivities, as well as new insights into structure-activity relationships. However, direct evidence for selectivity control via systematic tuning of the SAC coordination environment is scarce. In this work, we have synthesized two differently coordinated Bi SACs anchored to the same host material (carbon black) and characterized their CO2RR activities and selectivities. We find that oxophilic, oxygen-coordinated Bi atoms produce HCOOH, while nitrogen-coordinated Bi atoms generate CO. Importantly, use of the same support material assured that alternation of the coordination environment is the dominant factor for controlling the CO2RR product selectivity. Overall, this work demonstrates the structure-activity relationship of Bi SACs, which can be utilized to establish control over CO2RR product distributions, and highlights the promise for engineering atomic coordination environments of SACs to tune reaction pathways.</description>

                Catalysts involving post&#8208;transition metals have shown almost invincible performance on generating formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Conversely, Cu without post&#8208;transition metals have struggled to achieve comparable activity. In this study, a sulfur (S)&#8208;doped&#8208;copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalyst is developed, exhibiting excellent performance in formate generation with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 92% and a partial current density of 321 mA cm&#8208;2. Ex&#8208;situ structural elucidations reveal the presence of abundant grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8208;S bonds from the covellite phase during CO2RR. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that S&#8208;S bonds can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates, further improving the activity of the formate pathway. This work is significant in modifying a low&#8208;cost catalyst (Cu) with a non&#8208;metallic substance (S) to achieve comparable performance to mainstream catalysts for formate generation in industrial grade.</description>

                Experimental and numerical evaluation of steam and carbon dioxide gasification on torrefied palm kernel shell in an updraft fixed bed gasifier is studied. Euler-Lagrangian two-dimensional model with 15 kinetic reactions is developed to investigate tar formation in relation to torrefaction temperature, gasification temperature, and steam-to-carbon-dioxide ratio (S-CO2-R). The combination of steam and CO2 had considerable effect on the tar reduction and also influenced the gaseous composition significantly when the varying parameters were compared. The results show that increasing both gasification temperature and S-CO2-R do enhance the H2 production whiles drastically reducing the tar formation. The tar concentration reduced by 21.4 % and 20.5 % by changing the S-CO2-R from 0.4 to 2.0 and gasification process temperature from 973 and 1173 K respectively. An increase in hydrogen is also observed, from 55.5 % to 60.84 %, when the S-CO2-R is increased to 1.2. Similarly, 29.1 % increase is observed in gasification efficiency as compared to the raw-PKS.</description>

      <title>N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ Sites for C1/C2 Selectivity Regulation of Carbon Dioxide Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>

                Controlling the valence states of copper is pivotal in determining the selectivity of products in CO2 electroreduction. In this study, we developed a Cu doped carbon catalyst (CuNC) derived from a metal-organic framework (MOFs) through a straightforward solution reaction and calcination method. The N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ sites exhibited adjustable C1 and C2 selectivity in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CER). Specifically, the CuNC-700 demonstrated an impressive C2 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 56.0% at -1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a remarkable C1 FE of 56.7% with a total current density of 600 mA/cm2 at -1.6 V vs RHE. In the entire potential range, the CuNC-700 consistently maintained high FE values of &gt; 92% for CER, while the FE values for hydrogen evolution reaction is below 8%. This study unveiled the correlation between the selectivity and the valence states of copper. At low applied potentials, the abundance of N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ sites led to the predominant production of the C2 products. The Cu0 played a primary role in activating CO2 and facilitating subsequent electron transfer, while the Cu+ enhanced the adsorption of *CO, further promoting the C-C coupling. Under high applied potentials, both Cu2+ and Cu+ were converted to Cu0, favoring the methanation process. This research paves the way for future design of Cu-based MOF-derived materials, enabling precise regulation of C1/C2 selectivity in CER.</description>

                Excessive CO2 emission has caused serious environmental problems, and converting CO2 to high value-added fuels is attractive for solving energy and environmental crisis. Herein, a novel mesoporous TS-1(mTS-1) zeolite-confined metal oxides nanoclusters Cu-Bi@mTS-1 was developed for efficient photoelectrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (PEC CO2RR). The catalyst Cu-Bi@mTS-1 as a photocathode showed high activity, achieving a maximum methanol Faraday efficiency (FECH3OH) of 93.4% at -0.7 V vs. RHE. In-situ Raman results indicate the formation of key reaction intermediates *OCH3 and *CHO during the conversion of CO2 to CH3OH. The C2 product ethanol could be also detected at higher potentials during PEC CO2RR. It is believed that the hierarchically porous structure of mTS-1 is conducive to the enrichment of CO2 molecules to increase the reactant concentration, also can promote C-C coupling through photoelectric synergism.

      <title>Design of highly selective and stable CsPbI3 perovskite catalyst for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to C1 product</title>

                Finding efficient photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction catalysts is one of the core issues in addressing global climate change. Herein, the pristine CsPbI3 perovskite and doped CsPbI3 perovskite were evaluated in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to C1 products by using density functional theory. Free energy testing and electronic structure analysis methods have shown that doped CsPbI3 exhibits more effective catalytic performance, higher selectivity, and stability than undoped CsPbI3. Additionally, it is discovered that CsPbI3 (100) and (110) crystal surfaces have varied product selectivity. The photo-catalytic effectiveness is increased by the narrower band gap of Bi and Sn doped CsPbI3, which broadens the absorption spectrum of visible light and makes electron transport easier. The calculation results indicate that Bi doped CsPbI3 (100) and CsPbI3 (110) crystal faces exhibit good selectivity towards CH4, with free energy barriers as low as 0.55 eV and 0.58 eV, respectively. Sn doped CsPbI3 (100) and CsPbI3 (110) crystal planes exhibit good selectivity for HCOOH and CH3OH, respectively. The results indicate that the Bi and Sn doped CsPbI3 perovskite catalyst can further improve the CO2 photocatalytic activity and high selectivity for C1 products, making it a suitable substrate material for high-performance CO2RR.</description>

      <title>Effect of Co2 Shortage on the Performance of Membrane Electrode Co2 Electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4695651</link>

                To mitigate greenhouse effects, carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been used as an efficient means of carbon reduction. In CO2 electrolyzer, CO2 shortage can happen and degrade the reaction efficiency. Herein, an efficient and long-lived formic acid three-cell electrolyzer is used to study the effect of CO2 shortage, by operating the electrolyzer from full CO2 supply to CO2 shortage. In addition, the effects of various CO2 fluxes and concentrations on the electrolyzer current, acid concentration and lifetime are investigated. The results demonstrated that the electrolyzer current and the CO to H2 ratio both decreases from full CO2 to CO2 shortage, indicating that the reactivity of converting CO2 into formic acid ions is weakened. On the contrary, the hydrogen evolution reaction is intensified. Long-term CO2 shortage also cause the catalyst to detach and agglomerate in the cathode catalyst layer, reducing its active surface area and overall performance. Compared with the CO2 flux, the CO2 concentration exerts a more pronounced influence. To ensure the electrolysis efficiency, the carbon dioxide concentration should not be less than 80 %.</description>

      <title>Nature AND Nurture: Enabling formate-dependent growth in Methanosarcina acetivorans</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.08.574737</link>

                Methanogens are essential players in the global carbon cycle. Methanosarcinales possess one of the most diverse metabolic repertoires for methanogenesis, but they have never been observed to utilize formate as a substrate. We successfully reprogrammed the primary metabolism of Methanosarcina acetivorans by introducing an exogenous formate dehydrogenase derived from a closely related species. The engineered strains acquired the capacity to harness energy from formate-dependent methanogenesis pathways, including formate-dependent methyl reduction and formate-dependent carbon dioxide reduction. The ability of M. acetivorans to thrive on formate suggests the existence of essential accessory machinery and metabolic redundancy for generating reduced ferredoxins from F420H2. This remarkable plasticity in energy metabolism raises the possibility that an ancestral lineage of Methanosarcinales may have possessed the capacity to utilize formate. By combining this genetically modified strain with a disruption in methyl disproportionation, we have created a novel tool for investigating and manipulating the components of the F420 reduction and methanogenesis pathways independently.</description>

      <title>Peeking into the Femtosecond Hot-Carrier Dynamics Reveals Unexpected Mechanisms in Plasmonic Photocatalysis</title>

                Plasmonic-driven photocatalysis may lead to reaction selectivity that cannot be otherwise achieved. A fundamental role is played by hot carriers, i.e., electrons and holes generated upon plasmonic decay within the metal nanostructure interacting with molecular species. Understanding the elusive microscopic mechanism behind such selectivity is a key step in the rational design of hot-carrier reactions. To accomplish that, we present state-of-the-art multiscale simulations, going beyond density functional theory, of hot-carrier injections for the rate-determining step of a photocatalytic reaction. We focus on carbon dioxide reduction, for which it was experimentally shown that the presence of a rhodium nanocube under illumination leads to the selective production of methane against carbon monoxide. We show that selectivity is due to a (predominantly) direct hole injection from rhodium to the reaction intermediate CHO. Unexpectedly, such an injection does not promote the selective reaction path by favoring proper bond breaking but rather by promoting bonding of the proper molecular fragment to the surface.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR) is gaining momentum as an effective process to capture and convert CO 2 into valuable chemicals and fuels, as well as to contribute reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes) are increasingly attracting attention as CO 2 RR electrocatalysts due to their enhanced chemical activity and selectivity, overcoming limitations of traditional metal CO 2 RR electrocatalysts, and likely breaking the scaling relations of reaction intermediates toward the desired product. The present concept reviews the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the computational description of CO 2 RR on MXenes, going from CO 2 activation on pristine models to different surface terminations, and discuss possible ways to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity, including doping, defects, supported single metal atoms, solvent effects, and electric field effects, while putting in the spotlight prospects by including kinetic aspects.</description>

                Carbon capture and conversion are becoming increasingly important as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise and their adverse effects become increasingly evident. CO2 conversion/utilization-related research has gained renewed interest on a variety of platforms, including thermal, solar, biological, photochemical, and electrochemical conversions. Electrochemical routes, using suitable catalysts, are potentially suitable for commercial purposes owing to ease of integration with solvent-based carbon capture processes. This paper summarizes and evaluates the studies conducted within the past decade regarding the feasibility of carbon-based supports utilized in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. CO2 conversion has been reviewed in a number of reports, focusing on specific sections, such as metallic/bimetallic catalysts, CO2 solubility, and the fabrication of electrodes and electrochemical cells. The number of publications addressing various carbon-based electrocatalysts is increasing, but these materials have not yet been reviewed. Herein, we are focused on three types of electrocatalyst materials: metals, metal-oxides, non-oxides, and combinations thereof with carbon. The scope of this study includes the following: i) carbon-based materials and how they are characterized by distinctive properties, ii) electrocatalytic CO2 conversion techniques, and iii) research cases for carbon allotrope-supported composites used in CO2 reduction. The advancement in analytical tools that provide insight into liquid-phase reactions will benefit the development of catalysts and electrodes that will be effective in converting CO2 into the desired products. Such developments will also be applicable to other systems involving liquid electrolytes or solvents for performing reactions on catalyst surfaces.</description>

      <title>ATR&#8211;SEIRAS Method to Measure Interfacial pH during Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction on Cu</title>

                This study reports the accuracy and applications of an attenuated total reflectance&#8211;surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8211;SEIRAS) technique to indirectly measure the interfacial pH of the electrolyte using the ratio of phosphate species within 10 nm of the electrocatalyst surface. This technique can be used in situ to study aqueous electrochemical reactions with a calibration range from pH 1&#8211;13, time resolution down to 4 s, and an average 95% confidence interval of 14% that varies depending on the pH region (acidic, neutral, or basic). The method is applied in this study to electrochemical nitrate reduction at a copper cathode to demonstrate its capabilities, but is broadly applicable to any aqueous electrochemical reaction (such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, or oxygen evolution) and the electrocatalyst may be any SEIRAS-active thin film (e.g., silver, gold, or copper). The time-resolved results show a dramatic increase in the interfacial pH from pH 2&#8211;7 in the first minute of operation during both constant current and pulsed current experiments where the bulk pH is unchanged. Attempts to control the pH polarization at the surface by altering the electrochemical operating conditions&#8212;lowering the current or increasing the pulse frequency&#8212;showed no significant change, demonstrating the challenge of controlling the interfacial pH.</description>

      <title>A global synthesis of reported urban tree carbon production rates and approaches</title>

                Trees are a prominent feature of urban ecosystems. Urban tree productivity is a key component of urban ecosystem energetics and has been identified as a possible pathway for reducing global greenhouse gas concentrations. Recently, extensive research has been directed to evaluating the carbon dynamics of urban trees in cities throughout the world. Here, we synthesize this research, using results from previous studies from 154 cities to identify the distribution of urban tree productivity globally and the basis for generating urban tree productivity estimates. Reported urban tree productivity shows a strong relationship with estimated tree carbon content and exhibits increases with both temperature and precipitation, with land cover differences influencing the degree of climate sensitivity. Compared with a reference productivity estimate, urban trees showed greatly reduced estimated rates of productivity and the magnitude of reduced productivity was inversely correlated with precipitation but was independent of temperature. Reported rates of productivity across all studies suggest climate restrictions that are more important with less intensively managed land covers. Scaling these results globally suggests a limited opportunity for urban trees to contribute to atmospheric carbon dioxide reductions, especially in the absence of major carbon emission reductions. We found that the majority of results are derived from tree inventories from a single period with rates of productivity estimate through quasi-empirical or allometric models. The majority of studies have been conducted in temperate biomes and North America. These results show that existing urban tree assessments have substantial methodological restrictions and regional biases. Future research of urban tree productivity should look toward improved methods and can use this synthesis as a baseline for comparisons and improvement.</description>

                Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (ECO2RR) converts CO2 into value-added chemicals or fuels to realize carbon recycling as means to solve the problems of renewable energy shortage and environmental pollution. The development of cost-effective CO2RR catalysts with high activity, stability and selectivity is the key that enables efficient conversion from CO2 to valuable products. It is also important to understand intrinsic mechanisms of the underlying active-site that affect the performances of catalysts, which can, in turn, facilitate the rational design of more active electrocatalysts. In this context, it is particularly important to understand the structure-activity relationship of catalyst active sites during the CO2RR process from different atomic-scales, which inspires to organize this review. Specifically, we focus on the atomic-level construction of active sites from single atoms, dual-site metal, clusters, or/and graphitic carbon materials: key approaches for tailoring coordination configurations to enhance target product selectivity, i.e., optimizing the interplay between the catalytic active center and reactants or intermediates, disrupting the linear correlation of intermediate adsorption energies, and promoting intricate cascading reactions involving multiple intermediates. Highlight the intricate correlation between the structure-activity of CO2RR catalysts, which govern the discerning refinement of catalysts and propel advances in their practical application. Then, the electrocatalytic reactors for ECO2R reactions are critically reviewed. The acquisition of key metrics, the challenges faced, and the most suitable solutions for electrocatalytic CO2RR are proposed. Finally, future research directions and strategies are anticipated to inspire revolutionary advancements.</description>

      <title>Site Selection Evaluation of Co2 Storage in Saline Aquifers of Zhuyi Depression, the Pearl River Mouth Basin</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4691481</link>

                CO2 geological storage is the primary means of achieving large-scale, low-cost carbon dioxide reduction. Compared with onshore basins, sequestration in offshore basins has the advantages of larger storage volume and less impact on people and the environment. At the same time, there are also challenges such as high cost and technical difficulty for sequestration. At present, there are many researches on the selection and suitability evaluation of CCS in China, and there are also very successful demonstration applications, while the research on CO2 geological storage in sea areas is relatively few. Taking Zhuyi Depression of Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South China Sea as an example in this paper, with the goal of meeting the storage capacity of one million tons per year. Making statistics on the factors affecting the suitability of CO2 storage of oil and gas-bearing structures in the depression from three aspects: geological characteristics, storage economy and storage safety, and constructs a screening index system of CO2 geological storage field, which includes 3 levels and 18 evaluation factors. The index weight of each evaluation factor is calculated by AHP. The suitability of CO2 sealing of selected oil and gas-bearing structures is quantitatively evaluated by multi-source information overlap analysis. The results show that the Xijiang 23 and other oil-bearing structures in the west of Huizhou Sag have priority as the storage field. The results of this study can provide reference for the implementation and management decision of CO2 saline aquifers storage in this area.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction by borophene supported bimetallic catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.01.051</link>
      <description>Meiling Liu, Jayaraman Balamurugan, Tongxiang Liang, Chao Liu, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390766525

                Bimetal atom catalysts (BACs) hold significant potential for various applications as a result of the synergistic interaction between adjacent metal atoms. This interaction leads to improved catalytic performance, while simultaneously maintaining high atomic efficiency and exceptional selectivity, similar to single atom catalysts (SACs). Bimetallic site catalysts (M2&#946;12) supported by &#946;12-borophene were developed as catalysts for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The research on density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that M2&#946;12 exhibits exceptional stability, conductivity, and catalytic activity. Investigating the most efficient reaction pathway for CO2RR by analyzing the Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) during potential determining steps (PDS) and choosing a catalyst with outstanding catalytic performance for CO2RR. The overpotential required for Fe2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 to generate CO is merely 0.05 V. This implies that the conversion of CO2 to CO can be accomplished with minimal additional voltage. The overpotential values for Cu2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 during the formation of HCOOH were merely 0.001 and 0.07 V, respectively. Furthermore, the Rh2&#946;12 catalyst exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 0.51 V for CH3OH and 0.65 V for CH4. The Fe2&#946;12 produces C2H4 through the *CO-*CO pathway, while Ag2&#946;12 generates CH3CH2OH via the *CO-*CHO coupling pathway, with remarkably low overpotentials of 0.84 and 0.60 V, respectively. The study provides valuable insights for the systematic design and screening of electrocatalysts for CO2RR that exhibit exceptional catalytic performance and selectivity.</description>

      <title>Exploring the influence of interfacial solvation on electrochemical CO2 reduction using plasmon&#8208;enhanced vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy</title>

                Although interfacial solvation plays an important role in determining carbon dioxide reduction CO2 kinetics, present understanding of the potential dependent properties of the electrochemical double layer under conditions relevant for CO2R remains limited. This article summarizes the development and recent applications of plasmon&#8208;enhanced vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy to study the effects of cation hydration and interfacial solvation on CO2&#8203;R using CO as a vibrational Stark reporter. Results show that electrolyte cations retain their entire solvation shell upon adsorption to inactive sites, while active sites retain only a single water layer between the gold surface and the cation. Measurements also show that the total interfacial electric field can be separated into two contributions: one from the electrochemical double layer (Stern field) and another from the polar solvation environment (Onsager field). Surprisingly, correlating VSFG spectra with reaction kinetics reveals that it is the solvation&#8208;mediated Onsager field that governs the chemical reactivity at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Measuring the interfacial water spectra during electrocatalysis also provides evidence for the proton source during H2 evolution, which competes with CO2&#8203;R in aqueous electrolyte. These findings highlight the importance of directly probing cation hydration and interfacial solvation, which mediates reaction kinetics at electrochemical interfaces.</description>

                This research discusses theoretically the relationship between carbon tax with economy, tax and environment. This research is a legal research with analytical descriptive nature, namely research that analyzes secondary data on issues related to carbon taxes as an instrument for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. According to secondary data, this research is aimed at discovering aspects of carbon tax design, collection of carbon taxes, and state management of carbon tax revenues. Carbon taxes are an effective and efficient instrument to support the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. To be implemented, a carbon tax must be feasible. Eligibility requires public acceptance. On the other hand, a carbon tax can create a lot of controversy. The main argument against carbon taxes is that carbon taxes do not always guarantee emission reductions. In addition, there are also concerns over the unintended effects of competitiveness, carbon leakage, and fears of unintended distributional impacts, which could be barriers to implementation.</description>

                China&#8217;s transition to a green, low-carbon economy is among the most essential elements needed to achieve the climate goals set down in the Paris Agreement. China has pledged it &#8220;will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060&#8221;.1 Given the currently high emissions level in China and an economic structure with significant share of industrial sector and fossil fuel consumption, it remains a formidable challenge to realize such steep emission reduction for the 30-60 goals, as we call them in this paper.</description>

      <title>Monomeric gold hydrides for carbon dioxide reduction: ligand effect on the reactivity</title>

                We analyzed the ligand electronic effect in the reaction between a [LAu(I)H]0/&#8208; hydride species and CO2, leading to a coordinated formate [LAu(HCOO)]0/&#8208;. We explored 20 different ligands, such as carbenes, phosphines and others, carefully selected to cover a wide range of electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor properties. We included in the study the only ligand, an NHC&#8208;coordinated diphosphene, that, thus far, experimentally demonstrated facile and reversible reaction between the monomeric gold(I) hydride and carbon dioxide. We elucidated the previously unknown reaction mechanism, which resulted to be concerted and common to all the ligands: the gold&#8208;hydrogen bond attacks the carbon atom of CO2 with one oxygen atom coordinating to the gold center. A correlation between the ligand &#963; donor ability, which affects the electron density at the reactive site, and the kinetic activation barriers of the reaction has been found. This systematic study offers useful guidelines for the rational design of new ligands for this reaction, while suggesting a few promising and experimentally accessible potential candidates for the stoichiometric or catalytic CO2 activation.</description>

      <title>Tuning Carbon Dioxide Reduction Reaction Selectivity of Bi Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts with Controlled Coordination Environments</title>

                Control over product selectivity of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a crucial challenge for the sustainable production of carbon-based chemical feedstocks. In this regard, single-atom catalysts (SACs) are promising materials due to their tunable coordination environments, which could enable tailored catalytic activities and selectivities, as well as new insights into structure-activity relationships. However, direct evidence for selectivity control via systematic tuning of the SAC coordination environment is scarce. In this work, we have synthesized two differently coordinated Bi SACs anchored to the same host material (carbon black) and characterized their CO2RR activities and selectivities. We find that oxophilic, oxygen-coordinated Bi atoms produce HCOOH, while nitrogen-coordinated Bi atoms generate CO. Importantly, use of the same support material assured that alternation of the coordination environment is the dominant factor for controlling the CO2RR product selectivity. Overall, this work demonstrates the structure-activity relationship of Bi SACs, which can be utilized to establish control over CO2RR product distributions, and highlights the promise for engineering atomic coordination environments of SACs to tune reaction pathways.</description>

                Catalysts involving post&#8208;transition metals have shown almost invincible performance on generating formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Conversely, Cu without post&#8208;transition metals have struggled to achieve comparable activity. In this study, a sulfur (S)&#8208;doped&#8208;copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalyst is developed, exhibiting excellent performance in formate generation with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 92% and a partial current density of 321 mA cm&#8208;2. Ex&#8208;situ structural elucidations reveal the presence of abundant grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8208;S bonds from the covellite phase during CO2RR. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that S&#8208;S bonds can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates, further improving the activity of the formate pathway. This work is significant in modifying a low&#8208;cost catalyst (Cu) with a non&#8208;metallic substance (S) to achieve comparable performance to mainstream catalysts for formate generation in industrial grade.</description>

                Experimental and numerical evaluation of steam and carbon dioxide gasification on torrefied palm kernel shell in an updraft fixed bed gasifier is studied. Euler-Lagrangian two-dimensional model with 15 kinetic reactions is developed to investigate tar formation in relation to torrefaction temperature, gasification temperature, and steam-to-carbon-dioxide ratio (S-CO2-R). The combination of steam and CO2 had considerable effect on the tar reduction and also influenced the gaseous composition significantly when the varying parameters were compared. The results show that increasing both gasification temperature and S-CO2-R do enhance the H2 production whiles drastically reducing the tar formation. The tar concentration reduced by 21.4 % and 20.5 % by changing the S-CO2-R from 0.4 to 2.0 and gasification process temperature from 973 and 1173 K respectively. An increase in hydrogen is also observed, from 55.5 % to 60.84 %, when the S-CO2-R is increased to 1.2. Similarly, 29.1 % increase is observed in gasification efficiency as compared to the raw-PKS.</description>

      <title>N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ Sites for C1/C2 Selectivity Regulation of Carbon Dioxide Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>

                Controlling the valence states of copper is pivotal in determining the selectivity of products in CO2 electroreduction. In this study, we developed a Cu doped carbon catalyst (CuNC) derived from a metal-organic framework (MOFs) through a straightforward solution reaction and calcination method. The N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ sites exhibited adjustable C1 and C2 selectivity in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CER). Specifically, the CuNC-700 demonstrated an impressive C2 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 56.0% at -1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a remarkable C1 FE of 56.7% with a total current density of 600 mA/cm2 at -1.6 V vs RHE. In the entire potential range, the CuNC-700 consistently maintained high FE values of &gt; 92% for CER, while the FE values for hydrogen evolution reaction is below 8%. This study unveiled the correlation between the selectivity and the valence states of copper. At low applied potentials, the abundance of N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ sites led to the predominant production of the C2 products. The Cu0 played a primary role in activating CO2 and facilitating subsequent electron transfer, while the Cu+ enhanced the adsorption of *CO, further promoting the C-C coupling. Under high applied potentials, both Cu2+ and Cu+ were converted to Cu0, favoring the methanation process. This research paves the way for future design of Cu-based MOF-derived materials, enabling precise regulation of C1/C2 selectivity in CER.</description>

                Excessive CO2 emission has caused serious environmental problems, and converting CO2 to high value-added fuels is attractive for solving energy and environmental crisis. Herein, a novel mesoporous TS-1(mTS-1) zeolite-confined metal oxides nanoclusters Cu-Bi@mTS-1 was developed for efficient photoelectrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (PEC CO2RR). The catalyst Cu-Bi@mTS-1 as a photocathode showed high activity, achieving a maximum methanol Faraday efficiency (FECH3OH) of 93.4% at -0.7 V vs. RHE. In-situ Raman results indicate the formation of key reaction intermediates *OCH3 and *CHO during the conversion of CO2 to CH3OH. The C2 product ethanol could be also detected at higher potentials during PEC CO2RR. It is believed that the hierarchically porous structure of mTS-1 is conducive to the enrichment of CO2 molecules to increase the reactant concentration, also can promote C-C coupling through photoelectric synergism. This work provides a favorable reference for the rational design of photocathodes by confinement effect of porous structure.</description>

                Finding efficient photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction catalysts is one of the core issues in addressing global climate change. Herein, the pristine CsPbI3 perovskite and doped CsPbI3 perovskite were evaluated in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to C1 products by using density functional theory. Free energy testing and electronic structure analysis methods have shown that doped CsPbI3 exhibits more effective catalytic performance, higher selectivity, and stability than undoped CsPbI3. Additionally, it is discovered that CsPbI3 (100) and (110) crystal surfaces have varied product selectivity. The photo-catalytic effectiveness is increased by the narrower band gap of Bi and Sn doped CsPbI3, which broadens the absorption spectrum of visible light and makes electron transport easier. The calculation results indicate that Bi doped CsPbI3 (100) and CsPbI3 (110) crystal faces exhibit good selectivity towards CH4, with free energy barriers as low as 0.55 eV and 0.58 eV, respectively. Sn doped CsPbI3 (100) and CsPbI3 (110) crystal planes exhibit good selectivity for HCOOH and CH3OH, respectively. The results indicate that the Bi and Sn doped CsPbI3 perovskite catalyst can further improve the CO2 photocatalytic activity and high selectivity for C1 products, making it a suitable substrate material for high-performance CO2RR.</description>

      <title>Effect of Co2 Shortage on the Performance of Membrane Electrode Co2 Electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4695651</link>

                To mitigate greenhouse effects, carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been used as an efficient means of carbon reduction. In CO2 electrolyzer, CO2 shortage can happen and degrade the reaction efficiency. Herein, an efficient and long-lived formic acid three-cell electrolyzer is used to study the effect of CO2 shortage, by operating the electrolyzer from full CO2 supply to CO2 shortage. In addition, the effects of various CO2 fluxes and concentrations on the electrolyzer current, acid concentration and lifetime are investigated. The results demonstrated that the electrolyzer current and the CO to H2 ratio both decreases from full CO2 to CO2 shortage, indicating that the reactivity of converting CO2 into formic acid ions is weakened. On the contrary, the hydrogen evolution reaction is intensified. Long-term CO2 shortage also cause the catalyst to detach and agglomerate in the cathode catalyst layer, reducing its active surface area and overall performance. Compared with the CO2 flux, the CO2 concentration exerts a more pronounced influence. To ensure the electrolysis efficiency, the carbon dioxide concentration should not be less than 80 %.</description>

Methanosarcinales possess one of the most diverse metabolic repertoires for methanogenesis, but they have never been observed to utilize formate as a substrate. We successfully reprogrammed the primary metabolism of Methanosarcina acetivorans by introducing an exogenous formate dehydrogenase derived from a closely related species. The engineered strains acquired the capacity to harness energy from formate-dependent methanogenesis pathways, including formate-dependent methyl reduction and formate-dependent carbon dioxide reduction. The ability of M. acetivorans to thrive on formate suggests the existence of essential accessory machinery and metabolic redundancy for generating reduced ferredoxins from F420H2. This remarkable plasticity in energy metabolism raises the possibility that an ancestral lineage of Methanosarcinales may have possessed the capacity to utilize formate. By combining this genetically modified strain with a disruption in methyl disproportionation, we have created a novel tool for investigating and manipulating the components of the F420 reduction and methanogenesis pathways independently.</description>

      <title>Peeking into the Femtosecond Hot-Carrier Dynamics Reveals Unexpected Mechanisms in Plasmonic Photocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.3c12470</link>

                Plasmonic-driven photocatalysis may lead to reaction selectivity that cannot be otherwise achieved. A fundamental role is played by hot carriers, i.e., electrons and holes generated upon plasmonic decay within the metal nanostructure interacting with molecular species. Understanding the elusive microscopic mechanism behind such selectivity is a key step in the rational design of hot-carrier reactions. To accomplish that, we present state-of-the-art multiscale simulations, going beyond density functional theory, of hot-carrier injections for the rate-determining step of a photocatalytic reaction. We focus on carbon dioxide reduction, for which it was experimentally shown that the presence of a rhodium nanocube under illumination leads to the selective production of methane against carbon monoxide. We show that selectivity is due to a (predominantly) direct hole injection from rhodium to the reaction intermediate CHO. Unexpectedly, such an injection does not promote the selective reaction path by favoring proper bond breaking but rather by promoting bonding of the proper molecular fragment to the surface.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR) is gaining momentum as an effective process to capture and convert CO 2 into valuable chemicals and fuels, as well as to contribute reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes) are increasingly attracting attention as CO 2 RR electrocatalysts due to their enhanced chemical activity and selectivity, overcoming limitations of traditional metal CO 2 RR electrocatalysts, and likely breaking the scaling relations of reaction intermediates toward the desired product. The present concept reviews the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the computational description of CO 2 RR on MXenes, going from CO 2 activation on pristine models to different surface terminations, and discuss possible ways to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity, including doping, defects, supported single metal atoms, solvent effects, and electric field effects, while putting in the spotlight prospects by including kinetic aspects.</description>

                Carbon capture and conversion are becoming increasingly important as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise and their adverse effects become increasingly evident. CO2 conversion/utilization-related research has gained renewed interest on a variety of platforms, including thermal, solar, biological, photochemical, and electrochemical conversions. Electrochemical routes, using suitable catalysts, are potentially suitable for commercial purposes owing to ease of integration with solvent-based carbon capture processes. This paper summarizes and evaluates the studies conducted within the past decade regarding the feasibility of carbon-based supports utilized in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. CO2 conversion has been reviewed in a number of reports, focusing on specific sections, such as metallic/bimetallic catalysts, CO2 solubility, and the fabrication of electrodes and electrochemical cells. The number of publications addressing various carbon-based electrocatalysts is increasing, but these materials have not yet been reviewed. Herein, we are focused on three types of electrocatalyst materials: metals, metal-oxides, non-oxides, and combinations thereof with carbon. The scope of this study includes the following: i) carbon-based materials and how they are characterized by distinctive properties, ii) electrocatalytic CO2 conversion techniques, and iii) research cases for carbon allotrope-supported composites used in CO2 reduction. The advancement in analytical tools that provide insight into liquid-phase reactions will benefit the development of catalysts and electrodes that will be effective in converting CO2 into the desired products. Such developments will also be applicable to other systems involving liquid electrolytes or solvents for performing reactions on catalyst surfaces.</description>

      <title>ATR&#8211;SEIRAS Method to Measure Interfacial pH during Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction on Cu</title>

                This study reports the accuracy and applications of an attenuated total reflectance&#8211;surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8211;SEIRAS) technique to indirectly measure the interfacial pH of the electrolyte using the ratio of phosphate species within 10 nm of the electrocatalyst surface. This technique can be used in situ to study aqueous electrochemical reactions with a calibration range from pH 1&#8211;13, time resolution down to 4 s, and an average 95% confidence interval of 14% that varies depending on the pH region (acidic, neutral, or basic). The method is applied in this study to electrochemical nitrate reduction at a copper cathode to demonstrate its capabilities, but is broadly applicable to any aqueous electrochemical reaction (such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, or oxygen evolution) and the electrocatalyst may be any SEIRAS-active thin film (e.g., silver, gold, or copper). The time-resolved results show a dramatic increase in the interfacial pH from pH 2&#8211;7 in the first minute of operation during both constant current and pulsed current experiments where the bulk pH is unchanged. Attempts to control the pH polarization at the surface by altering the electrochemical operating conditions&#8212;lowering the current or increasing the pulse frequency&#8212;showed no significant change, demonstrating the challenge of controlling the interfacial pH.</description>

      <title>A global synthesis of reported urban tree carbon production rates and approaches</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1244418</link>

                Trees are a prominent feature of urban ecosystems. Urban tree productivity is a key component of urban ecosystem energetics and has been identified as a possible pathway for reducing global greenhouse gas concentrations. Recently, extensive research has been directed to evaluating the carbon dynamics of urban trees in cities throughout the world. Here, we synthesize this research, using results from previous studies from 154 cities to identify the distribution of urban tree productivity globally and the basis for generating urban tree productivity estimates. Reported urban tree productivity shows a strong relationship with estimated tree carbon content and exhibits increases with both temperature and precipitation, with land cover differences influencing the degree of climate sensitivity. Compared with a reference productivity estimate, urban trees showed greatly reduced estimated rates of productivity and the magnitude of reduced productivity was inversely correlated with precipitation but was independent of temperature. Reported rates of productivity across all studies suggest climate restrictions that are more important with less intensively managed land covers. Scaling these results globally suggests a limited opportunity for urban trees to contribute to atmospheric carbon dioxide reductions, especially in the absence of major carbon emission reductions. We found that the majority of results are derived from tree inventories from a single period with rates of productivity estimate through quasi-empirical or allometric models. The majority of studies have been conducted in temperate biomes and North America. These results show that existing urban tree assessments have substantial methodological restrictions and regional biases. Future research of urban tree productivity should look toward improved methods and can use this synthesis as a baseline for comparisons and improvement.</description>

                Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (ECO2RR) converts CO2 into value-added chemicals or fuels to realize carbon recycling as means to solve the problems of renewable energy shortage and environmental pollution. The development of cost-effective CO2RR catalysts with high activity, stability and selectivity is the key that enables efficient conversion from CO2 to valuable products. It is also important to understand intrinsic mechanisms of the underlying active-site that affect the performances of catalysts, which can, in turn, facilitate the rational design of more active electrocatalysts. In this context, it is particularly important to understand the structure-activity relationship of catalyst active sites during the CO2RR process from different atomic-scales, which inspires to organize this review. Specifically, we focus on the atomic-level construction of active sites from single atoms, dual-site metal, clusters, or/and graphitic carbon materials: key approaches for tailoring coordination configurations to enhance target product selectivity, i.e., optimizing the interplay between the catalytic active center and reactants or intermediates, disrupting the linear correlation of intermediate adsorption energies, and promoting intricate cascading reactions involving multiple intermediates. Highlight the intricate correlation between the structure-activity of CO2RR catalysts, which govern the discerning refinement of catalysts and propel advances in their practical application. Then, the electrocatalytic reactors for ECO2R reactions are critically reviewed. The acquisition of key metrics, the challenges faced, and the most suitable solutions for electrocatalytic CO2RR are proposed. Finally, future research directions and strategies are anticipated to inspire revolutionary advancements.</description>

      <title>Site Selection Evaluation of Co2 Storage in Saline Aquifers of Zhuyi Depression, the Pearl River Mouth Basin</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4691481</link>

                CO2 geological storage is the primary means of achieving large-scale, low-cost carbon dioxide reduction. Compared with onshore basins, sequestration in offshore basins has the advantages of larger storage volume and less impact on people and the environment. At the same time, there are also challenges such as high cost and technical difficulty for sequestration. At present, there are many researches on the selection and suitability evaluation of CCS in China, and there are also very successful demonstration applications, while the research on CO2 geological storage in sea areas is relatively few. Taking Zhuyi Depression of Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South China Sea as an example in this paper, with the goal of meeting the storage capacity of one million tons per year. Making statistics on the factors affecting the suitability of CO2 storage of oil and gas-bearing structures in the depression from three aspects: geological characteristics, storage economy and storage safety, and constructs a screening index system of CO2 geological storage field, which includes 3 levels and 18 evaluation factors. The index weight of each evaluation factor is calculated by AHP. The suitability of CO2 sealing of selected oil and gas-bearing structures is quantitatively evaluated by multi-source information overlap analysis. The results show that the Xijiang 23 and other oil-bearing structures in the west of Huizhou Sag have priority as the storage field. The results of this study can provide reference for the implementation and management decision of CO2 saline aquifers storage in this area.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction by borophene supported bimetallic catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.01.051</link>
      <description>Meiling Liu, Jayaraman Balamurugan, Tongxiang Liang, Chao Liu, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390766525

                Bimetal atom catalysts (BACs) hold significant potential for various applications as a result of the synergistic interaction between adjacent metal atoms. This interaction leads to improved catalytic performance, while simultaneously maintaining high atomic efficiency and exceptional selectivity, similar to single atom catalysts (SACs). Bimetallic site catalysts (M2&#946;12) supported by &#946;12-borophene were developed as catalysts for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The research on density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that M2&#946;12 exhibits exceptional stability, conductivity, and catalytic activity. Investigating the most efficient reaction pathway for CO2RR by analyzing the Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) during potential determining steps (PDS) and choosing a catalyst with outstanding catalytic performance for CO2RR. The overpotential required for Fe2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 to generate CO is merely 0.05 V. This implies that the conversion of CO2 to CO can be accomplished with minimal additional voltage. The overpotential values for Cu2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 during the formation of HCOOH were merely 0.001 and 0.07 V, respectively. Furthermore, the Rh2&#946;12 catalyst exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 0.51 V for CH3OH and 0.65 V for CH4. The Fe2&#946;12 produces C2H4 through the *CO-*CO pathway, while Ag2&#946;12 generates CH3CH2OH via the *CO-*CHO coupling pathway, with remarkably low overpotentials of 0.84 and 0.60 V, respectively. The study provides valuable insights for the systematic design and screening of electrocatalysts for CO2RR that exhibit exceptional catalytic performance and selectivity.</description>

      <title>Exploring the influence of interfacial solvation on electrochemical CO2 reduction using plasmon&#8208;enhanced vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy</title>

                Although interfacial solvation plays an important role in determining carbon dioxide reduction CO2 kinetics, present understanding of the potential dependent properties of the electrochemical double layer under conditions relevant for CO2R remains limited. This article summarizes the development and recent applications of plasmon&#8208;enhanced vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy to study the effects of cation hydration and interfacial solvation on CO2&#8203;R using CO as a vibrational Stark reporter. Results show that electrolyte cations retain their entire solvation shell upon adsorption to inactive sites, while active sites retain only a single water layer between the gold surface and the cation. Measurements also show that the total interfacial electric field can be separated into two contributions: one from the electrochemical double layer (Stern field) and another from the polar solvation environment (Onsager field). Surprisingly, correlating VSFG spectra with reaction kinetics reveals that it is the solvation&#8208;mediated Onsager field that governs the chemical reactivity at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Measuring the interfacial water spectra during electrocatalysis also provides evidence for the proton source during H2 evolution, which competes with CO2&#8203;R in aqueous electrolyte. These findings highlight the importance of directly probing cation hydration and interfacial solvation, which mediates reaction kinetics at electrochemical interfaces.</description>

                This research discusses theoretically the relationship between carbon tax with economy, tax and environment. This research is a legal research with analytical descriptive nature, namely research that analyzes secondary data on issues related to carbon taxes as an instrument for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. According to secondary data, this research is aimed at discovering aspects of carbon tax design, collection of carbon taxes, and state management of carbon tax revenues. Carbon taxes are an effective and efficient instrument to support the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. To be implemented, a carbon tax must be feasible. Eligibility requires public acceptance. On the other hand, a carbon tax can create a lot of controversy. The main argument against carbon taxes is that carbon taxes do not always guarantee emission reductions. In addition, there are also concerns over the unintended effects of competitiveness, carbon leakage, and fears of unintended distributional impacts, which could be barriers to implementation.</description>

      <title>Monomeric gold hydrides for carbon dioxide reduction: ligand effect on the reactivity</title>

                We analyzed the ligand electronic effect in the reaction between a [LAu(I)H]0/&#8208; hydride species and CO2, leading to a coordinated formate [LAu(HCOO)]0/&#8208;. We explored 20 different ligands, such as carbenes, phosphines and others, carefully selected to cover a wide range of electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor properties. We included in the study the only ligand, an NHC&#8208;coordinated diphosphene, that, thus far, experimentally demonstrated facile and reversible reaction between the monomeric gold(I) hydride and carbon dioxide. We elucidated the previously unknown reaction mechanism, which resulted to be concerted and common to all the ligands: the gold&#8208;hydrogen bond attacks the carbon atom of CO2 with one oxygen atom coordinating to the gold center. A correlation between the ligand &#963; donor ability, which affects the electron density at the reactive site, and the kinetic activation barriers of the reaction has been found. This systematic study offers useful guidelines for the rational design of new ligands for this reaction, while suggesting a few promising and experimentally accessible potential candidates for the stoichiometric or catalytic CO2 activation.</description>

      <title>Tuning Carbon Dioxide Reduction Reaction Selectivity of Bi Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts with Controlled Coordination Environments</title>

                Control over product selectivity of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a crucial challenge for the sustainable production of carbon-based chemical feedstocks. In this regard, single-atom catalysts (SACs) are promising materials due to their tunable coordination environments, which could enable tailored catalytic activities and selectivities, as well as new insights into structure-activity relationships. However, direct evidence for selectivity control via systematic tuning of the SAC coordination environment is scarce. In this work, we have synthesized two differently coordinated Bi SACs anchored to the same host material (carbon black) and characterized their CO2RR activities and selectivities. We find that oxophilic, oxygen-coordinated Bi atoms produce HCOOH, while nitrogen-coordinated Bi atoms generate CO. Importantly, use of the same support material assured that alternation of the coordination environment is the dominant factor for controlling the CO2RR product selectivity. Overall, this work demonstrates the structure-activity relationship of Bi SACs, which can be utilized to establish control over CO2RR product distributions, and highlights the promise for engineering atomic coordination environments of SACs to tune reaction pathways.</description>

                Catalysts involving post&#8208;transition metals have shown almost invincible performance on generating formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Conversely, Cu without post&#8208;transition metals have struggled to achieve comparable activity. In this study, a sulfur (S)&#8208;doped&#8208;copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalyst is developed, exhibiting excellent performance in formate generation with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 92% and a partial current density of 321 mA cm&#8208;2. Ex&#8208;situ structural elucidations reveal the presence of abundant grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8208;S bonds from the covellite phase during CO2RR. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that S&#8208;S bonds can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates, further improving the activity of the formate pathway. This work is significant in modifying a low&#8208;cost catalyst (Cu) with a non&#8208;metallic substance (S) to achieve comparable performance to mainstream catalysts for formate generation in industrial grade.</description>

                Experimental and numerical evaluation of steam and carbon dioxide gasification on torrefied palm kernel shell in an updraft fixed bed gasifier is studied. Euler-Lagrangian two-dimensional model with 15 kinetic reactions is developed to investigate tar formation in relation to torrefaction temperature, gasification temperature, and steam-to-carbon-dioxide ratio (S-CO2-R). The combination of steam and CO2 had considerable effect on the tar reduction and also influenced the gaseous composition significantly when the varying parameters were compared. The results show that increasing both gasification temperature and S-CO2-R do enhance the H2 production whiles drastically reducing the tar formation. The tar concentration reduced by 21.4 % and 20.5 % by changing the S-CO2-R from 0.4 to 2.0 and gasification process temperature from 973 and 1173 K respectively. An increase in hydrogen is also observed, from 55.5 % to 60.84 %, when the S-CO2-R is increased to 1.2. Similarly, 29.1 % increase is observed in gasification efficiency as compared to the raw-PKS.</description>

      <title>N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ Sites for C1/C2 Selectivity Regulation of Carbon Dioxide Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>

                Controlling the valence states of copper is pivotal in determining the selectivity of products in CO2 electroreduction. In this study, we developed a Cu doped carbon catalyst (CuNC) derived from a metal-organic framework (MOFs) through a straightforward solution reaction and calcination method. The N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ sites exhibited adjustable C1 and C2 selectivity in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CER). Specifically, the CuNC-700 demonstrated an impressive C2 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 56.0% at -1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a remarkable C1 FE of 56.7% with a total current density of 600 mA/cm2 at -1.6 V vs RHE. In the entire potential range, the CuNC-700 consistently maintained high FE values of &gt; 92% for CER, while the FE values for hydrogen evolution reaction is below 8%. This study unveiled the correlation between the selectivity and the valence states of copper. At low applied potentials, the abundance of N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ sites led to the predominant production of the C2 products. The Cu0 played a primary role in activating CO2 and facilitating subsequent electron transfer, while the Cu+ enhanced the adsorption of *CO, further promoting the C-C coupling. Under high applied potentials, both Cu2+ and Cu+ were converted to Cu0, favoring the methanation process. This research paves the way for future design of Cu-based MOF-derived materials, enabling precise regulation of C1/C2 selectivity in CER.</description>

      <title>Mesoporous Ts-1 Zeolite-Confined Metal Oxides Photocathode for Efficient Reduction of Carbon Dioxide to Methanol</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4697343</link>

                Excessive CO2 emission has caused serious environmental problems, and converting CO2 to high value-added fuels is attractive for solving energy and environmental crisis. Herein, a novel mesoporous TS-1(mTS-1) zeolite-confined metal oxides nanoclusters Cu-Bi@mTS-1 was developed for efficient photoelectrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (PEC CO2RR). The catalyst Cu-Bi@mTS-1 as a photocathode showed high activity, achieving a maximum methanol Faraday efficiency (FECH3OH) of 93.4% at -0.7 V vs. RHE. In-situ Raman results indicate the formation of key reaction intermediates *OCH3 and *CHO during the conversion of CO2 to CH3OH. The C2 product ethanol could be also detected at higher potentials during PEC CO2RR. It is believed that the hierarchically porous structure of mTS-1 is conducive to the enrichment of CO2 molecules to increase the reactant concentration, also can promote C-C coupling through photoelectric synergism. This work provides a favorable reference for the rational design of photocathodes by confinement effect of porous structure.</description>

      <title>Design of highly selective and stable CsPbI3 perovskite catalyst for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to C1 product</title>

                Finding efficient photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction catalysts is one of the core issues in addressing global climate change. Herein, the pristine CsPbI3 perovskite and doped CsPbI3 perovskite were evaluated in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to C1 products by using density functional theory. Free energy testing and electronic structure analysis methods have shown that doped CsPbI3 exhibits more effective catalytic performance, higher selectivity, and stability than undoped CsPbI3. Additionally, it is discovered that CsPbI3 (100) and (110) crystal surfaces have varied product selectivity. The photo-catalytic effectiveness is increased by the narrower band gap of Bi and Sn doped CsPbI3, which broadens the absorption spectrum of visible light and makes electron transport easier. The calculation results indicate that Bi doped CsPbI3 (100) and CsPbI3 (110) crystal faces exhibit good selectivity towards CH4, with free energy barriers as low as 0.55 eV and 0.58 eV, respectively. Sn doped CsPbI3 (100) and CsPbI3 (110) crystal planes exhibit good selectivity for HCOOH and CH3OH, respectively. The results indicate that the Bi and Sn doped CsPbI3 perovskite catalyst can further improve the CO2 photocatalytic activity and high selectivity for C1 products, making it a suitable substrate material for high-performance CO2RR.</description>

      <title>Effect of Co2 Shortage on the Performance of Membrane Electrode Co2 Electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4695651</link>

                To mitigate greenhouse effects, carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been used as an efficient means of carbon reduction. In CO2 electrolyzer, CO2 shortage can happen and degrade the reaction efficiency. Herein, an efficient and long-lived formic acid three-cell electrolyzer is used to study the effect of CO2 shortage, by operating the electrolyzer from full CO2 supply to CO2 shortage. In addition, the effects of various CO2 fluxes and concentrations on the electrolyzer current, acid concentration and lifetime are investigated. The results demonstrated that the electrolyzer current and the CO to H2 ratio both decreases from full CO2 to CO2 shortage, indicating that the reactivity of converting CO2 into formic acid ions is weakened. On the contrary, the hydrogen evolution reaction is intensified. Long-term CO2 shortage also cause the catalyst to detach and agglomerate in the cathode catalyst layer, reducing its active surface area and overall performance. Compared with the CO2 flux, the CO2 concentration exerts a more pronounced influence. To ensure the electrolysis efficiency, the carbon dioxide concentration should not be less than 80 %.</description>

      <title>Nature AND Nurture: Enabling formate-dependent growth in Methanosarcina acetivorans</title>

                Methanogens are essential players in the global carbon cycle. Methanosarcinales possess one of the most diverse metabolic repertoires for methanogenesis, but they have never been observed to utilize formate as a substrate. We successfully reprogrammed the primary metabolism of Methanosarcina acetivorans by introducing an exogenous formate dehydrogenase derived from a closely related species. The engineered strains acquired the capacity to harness energy from formate-dependent methanogenesis pathways, including formate-dependent methyl reduction and formate-dependent carbon dioxide reduction. The ability of M. acetivorans to thrive on formate suggests the existence of essential accessory machinery and metabolic redundancy for generating reduced ferredoxins from F420H2. This remarkable plasticity in energy metabolism raises the possibility that an ancestral lineage of Methanosarcinales may have possessed the capacity to utilize formate. By combining this genetically modified strain with a disruption in methyl disproportionation, we have created a novel tool for investigating and manipulating the components of the F420 reduction and methanogenesis pathways independently.</description>

      <title>Peeking into the Femtosecond Hot-Carrier Dynamics Reveals Unexpected Mechanisms in Plasmonic Photocatalysis</title>

                Plasmonic-driven photocatalysis may lead to reaction selectivity that cannot be otherwise achieved. A fundamental role is played by hot carriers, i.e., electrons and holes generated upon plasmonic decay within the metal nanostructure interacting with molecular species. Understanding the elusive microscopic mechanism behind such selectivity is a key step in the rational design of hot-carrier reactions. To accomplish that, we present state-of-the-art multiscale simulations, going beyond density functional theory, of hot-carrier injections for the rate-determining step of a photocatalytic reaction. We focus on carbon dioxide reduction, for which it was experimentally shown that the presence of a rhodium nanocube under illumination leads to the selective production of methane against carbon monoxide. We show that selectivity is due to a (predominantly) direct hole injection from rhodium to the reaction intermediate CHO. Unexpectedly, such an injection does not promote the selective reaction path by favoring proper bond breaking but rather by promoting bonding of the proper molecular fragment to the surface.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR) is gaining momentum as an effective process to capture and convert CO 2 into valuable chemicals and fuels, as well as to contribute reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes) are increasingly attracting attention as CO 2 RR electrocatalysts due to their enhanced chemical activity and selectivity, overcoming limitations of traditional metal CO 2 RR electrocatalysts, and likely breaking the scaling relations of reaction intermediates toward the desired product. The present concept reviews the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the computational description of CO 2 RR on MXenes, going from CO 2 activation on pristine models to different surface terminations, and discuss possible ways to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity, including doping, defects, supported single metal atoms, solvent effects, and electric field effects, while putting in the spotlight prospects by including kinetic aspects.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.022</link>
      <description>Afdhal Yuda, Parisa Ebrahimi, Josephine Selvaraj, Anand Kumar, Vaidyanathan Subramanian, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 57(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390721078

                Carbon capture and conversion are becoming increasingly important as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise and their adverse effects become increasingly evident. CO2 conversion/utilization-related research has gained renewed interest on a variety of platforms, including thermal, solar, biological, photochemical, and electrochemical conversions. Electrochemical routes, using suitable catalysts, are potentially suitable for commercial purposes owing to ease of integration with solvent-based carbon capture processes. This paper summarizes and evaluates the studies conducted within the past decade regarding the feasibility of carbon-based supports utilized in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. CO2 conversion has been reviewed in a number of reports, focusing on specific sections, such as metallic/bimetallic catalysts, CO2 solubility, and the fabrication of electrodes and electrochemical cells. The number of publications addressing various carbon-based electrocatalysts is increasing, but these materials have not yet been reviewed. Herein, we are focused on three types of electrocatalyst materials: metals, metal-oxides, non-oxides, and combinations thereof with carbon. The scope of this study includes the following: i) carbon-based materials and how they are characterized by distinctive properties, ii) electrocatalytic CO2 conversion techniques, and iii) research cases for carbon allotrope-supported composites used in CO2 reduction. The advancement in analytical tools that provide insight into liquid-phase reactions will benefit the development of catalysts and electrodes that will be effective in converting CO2 into the desired products. Such developments will also be applicable to other systems involving liquid electrolytes or solvents for performing reactions on catalyst surfaces.</description>

      <title>ATR&#8211;SEIRAS Method to Measure Interfacial pH during Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction on Cu</title>

                This study reports the accuracy and applications of an attenuated total reflectance&#8211;surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8211;SEIRAS) technique to indirectly measure the interfacial pH of the electrolyte using the ratio of phosphate species within 10 nm of the electrocatalyst surface. This technique can be used in situ to study aqueous electrochemical reactions with a calibration range from pH 1&#8211;13, time resolution down to 4 s, and an average 95% confidence interval of 14% that varies depending on the pH region (acidic, neutral, or basic). The method is applied in this study to electrochemical nitrate reduction at a copper cathode to demonstrate its capabilities, but is broadly applicable to any aqueous electrochemical reaction (such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, or oxygen evolution) and the electrocatalyst may be any SEIRAS-active thin film (e.g., silver, gold, or copper). The time-resolved results show a dramatic increase in the interfacial pH from pH 2&#8211;7 in the first minute of operation during both constant current and pulsed current experiments where the bulk pH is unchanged.

                Trees are a prominent feature of urban ecosystems. Urban tree productivity is a key component of urban ecosystem energetics and has been identified as a possible pathway for reducing global greenhouse gas concentrations. Recently, extensive research has been directed to evaluating the carbon dynamics of urban trees in cities throughout the world. Here, we synthesize this research, using results from previous studies from 154 cities to identify the distribution of urban tree productivity globally and the basis for generating urban tree productivity estimates. Reported urban tree productivity shows a strong relationship with estimated tree carbon content and exhibits increases with both temperature and precipitation, with land cover differences influencing the degree of climate sensitivity. Compared with a reference productivity estimate, urban trees showed greatly reduced estimated rates of productivity and the magnitude of reduced productivity was inversely correlated with precipitation but was independent of temperature. Reported rates of productivity across all studies suggest climate restrictions that are more important with less intensively managed land covers. Scaling these results globally suggests a limited opportunity for urban trees to contribute to atmospheric carbon dioxide reductions, especially in the absence of major carbon emission reductions. We found that the majority of results are derived from tree inventories from a single period with rates of productivity estimate through quasi-empirical or allometric models. The majority of studies have been conducted in temperate biomes and North America. These results show that existing urban tree assessments have substantial methodological restrictions and regional biases. Future research of urban tree productivity should look toward improved methods and can use this synthesis as a baseline for comparisons and improvement.</description>

                Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (ECO2RR) converts CO2 into value-added chemicals or fuels to realize carbon recycling as means to solve the problems of renewable energy shortage and environmental pollution. The development of cost-effective CO2RR catalysts with high activity, stability and selectivity is the key that enables efficient conversion from CO2 to valuable products. It is also important to understand intrinsic mechanisms of the underlying active-site that affect the performances of catalysts, which can, in turn, facilitate the rational design of more active electrocatalysts. In this context, it is particularly important to understand the structure-activity relationship of catalyst active sites during the CO2RR process from different atomic-scales, which inspires to organize this review. Specifically, we focus on the atomic-level construction of active sites from single atoms, dual-site metal, clusters, or/and graphitic carbon materials: key approaches for tailoring coordination configurations to enhance target product selectivity, i.e., optimizing the interplay between the catalytic active center and reactants or intermediates, disrupting the linear correlation of intermediate adsorption energies, and promoting intricate cascading reactions involving multiple intermediates. Highlight the intricate correlation between the structure-activity of CO2RR catalysts, which govern the discerning refinement of catalysts and propel advances in their practical application. Then, the electrocatalytic reactors for ECO2R reactions are critically reviewed. The acquisition of key metrics, the challenges faced, and the most suitable solutions for electrocatalytic CO2RR are proposed. Finally, future research directions and strategies are anticipated to inspire revolutionary advancements.</description>

                CO2 geological storage is the primary means of achieving large-scale, low-cost carbon dioxide reduction. Compared with onshore basins, sequestration in offshore basins has the advantages of larger storage volume and less impact on people and the environment. At the same time, there are also challenges such as high cost and technical difficulty for sequestration. At present, there are many researches on the selection and suitability evaluation of CCS in China, and there are also very successful demonstration applications, while the research on CO2 geological storage in sea areas is relatively few. Taking Zhuyi Depression of Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South China Sea as an example in this paper, with the goal of meeting the storage capacity of one million tons per year. Making statistics on the factors affecting the suitability of CO2 storage of oil and gas-bearing structures in the depression from three aspects: geological characteristics, storage economy and storage safety, and constructs a screening index system of CO2 geological storage field, which includes 3 levels and 18 evaluation factors. The index weight of each evaluation factor is calculated by AHP. The suitability of CO2 sealing of selected oil and gas-bearing structures is quantitatively evaluated by multi-source information overlap analysis. The results show that the Xijiang 23 and other oil-bearing structures in the west of Huizhou Sag have priority as the storage field. The results of this study can provide reference for the implementation and management decision of CO2 saline aquifers storage in this area.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction by borophene supported bimetallic catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.01.051</link>
      <description>Meiling Liu, Jayaraman Balamurugan, Tongxiang Liang, Chao Liu, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390766525

                Bimetal atom catalysts (BACs) hold significant potential for various applications as a result of the synergistic interaction between adjacent metal atoms. This interaction leads to improved catalytic performance, while simultaneously maintaining high atomic efficiency and exceptional selectivity, similar to single atom catalysts (SACs). Bimetallic site catalysts (M2&#946;12) supported by &#946;12-borophene were developed as catalysts for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The research on density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that M2&#946;12 exhibits exceptional stability, conductivity, and catalytic activity. Investigating the most efficient reaction pathway for CO2RR by analyzing the Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) during potential determining steps (PDS) and choosing a catalyst with outstanding catalytic performance for CO2RR. The overpotential required for Fe2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 to generate CO is merely 0.05 V. This implies that the conversion of CO2 to CO can be accomplished with minimal additional voltage. The overpotential values for Cu2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 during the formation of HCOOH were merely 0.001 and 0.07 V, respectively. Furthermore, the Rh2&#946;12 catalyst exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 0.51 V for CH3OH and 0.65 V for CH4. The Fe2&#946;12 produces C2H4 through the *CO-*CO pathway, while Ag2&#946;12 generates CH3CH2OH via the *CO-*CHO coupling pathway, with remarkably low overpotentials of 0.84 and 0.60 V, respectively. The study provides valuable insights for the systematic design and screening of electrocatalysts for CO2RR that exhibit exceptional catalytic performance and selectivity.</description>

      <title>Exploring the influence of interfacial solvation on electrochemical CO2 reduction using plasmon&#8208;enhanced vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy</title>

                Although interfacial solvation plays an important role in determining carbon dioxide reduction CO2 kinetics, present understanding of the potential dependent properties of the electrochemical double layer under conditions relevant for CO2R remains limited. This article summarizes the development and recent applications of plasmon&#8208;enhanced vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy to study the effects of cation hydration and interfacial solvation on CO2&#8203;R using CO as a vibrational Stark reporter. Results show that electrolyte cations retain their entire solvation shell upon adsorption to inactive sites, while active sites retain only a single water layer between the gold surface and the cation. Measurements also show that the total interfacial electric field can be separated into two contributions: one from the electrochemical double layer (Stern field) and another from the polar solvation environment (Onsager field). Surprisingly, correlating VSFG spectra with reaction kinetics reveals that it is the solvation&#8208;mediated Onsager field that governs the chemical reactivity at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Measuring the interfacial water spectra during electrocatalysis also provides evidence for the proton source during H2 evolution, which competes with CO2&#8203;R in aqueous electrolyte. These findings highlight the importance of directly probing cation hydration and interfacial solvation, which mediates reaction kinetics at electrochemical interfaces.</description>

      <title>CARBON TAX AND ITS EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY, TAXES AND ENVIRONMENT</title>

      <description>M.E. Retno Kadarukmi, Awang Long Law Review. 6(1)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4390652284

                This research discusses theoretically the relationship between carbon tax with economy, tax and environment. This research is a legal research with analytical descriptive nature, namely research that analyzes secondary data on issues related to carbon taxes as an instrument for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. According to secondary data, this research is aimed at discovering aspects of carbon tax design, collection of carbon taxes, and state management of carbon tax revenues. Carbon taxes are an effective and efficient instrument to support the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. To be implemented, a carbon tax must be feasible. Eligibility requires public acceptance. On the other hand, a carbon tax can create a lot of controversy. The main argument against carbon taxes is that carbon taxes do not always guarantee emission reductions. In addition, there are also concerns over the unintended effects of competitiveness, carbon leakage, and fears of unintended distributional impacts, which could be barriers to implementation.</description>

                China&#8217;s transition to a green, low-carbon economy is among the most essential elements needed to achieve the climate goals set down in the Paris Agreement. China has pledged it &#8220;will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060&#8221;.1 Given the currently high emissions level in China and an economic structure with significant share of industrial sector and fossil fuel consumption, it remains a formidable challenge to realize such steep emission reduction for the 30-60 goals, as we call them in this paper.</description>

      <title>Monomeric gold hydrides for carbon dioxide reduction: ligand effect on the reactivity</title>

                We analyzed the ligand electronic effect in the reaction between a [LAu(I)H]0/&#8208; hydride species and CO2, leading to a coordinated formate [LAu(HCOO)]0/&#8208;. We explored 20 different ligands, such as carbenes, phosphines and others, carefully selected to cover a wide range of electron&#8208;donor and &#8208;acceptor properties. We included in the study the only ligand, an NHC&#8208;coordinated diphosphene, that, thus far, experimentally demonstrated facile and reversible reaction between the monomeric gold(I) hydride and carbon dioxide. We elucidated the previously unknown reaction mechanism, which resulted to be concerted and common to all the ligands: the gold&#8208;hydrogen bond attacks the carbon atom of CO2 with one oxygen atom coordinating to the gold center. A correlation between the ligand &#963; donor ability, which affects the electron density at the reactive site, and the kinetic activation barriers of the reaction has been found. This systematic study offers useful guidelines for the rational design of new ligands for this reaction, while suggesting a few promising and experimentally accessible potential candidates for the stoichiometric or catalytic CO2 activation.</description>

      <title>Tuning Carbon Dioxide Reduction Reaction Selectivity of Bi Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts with Controlled Coordination Environments</title>

                Control over product selectivity of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a crucial challenge for the sustainable production of carbon-based chemical feedstocks. In this regard, single-atom catalysts (SACs) are promising materials due to their tunable coordination environments, which could enable tailored catalytic activities and selectivities, as well as new insights into structure-activity relationships. However, direct evidence for selectivity control via systematic tuning of the SAC coordination environment is scarce. In this work, we have synthesized two differently coordinated Bi SACs anchored to the same host material (carbon black) and characterized their CO2RR activities and selectivities. We find that oxophilic, oxygen-coordinated Bi atoms produce HCOOH, while nitrogen-coordinated Bi atoms generate CO. Importantly, use of the same support material assured that alternation of the coordination environment is the dominant factor for controlling the CO2RR product selectivity. Overall, this work demonstrates the structure-activity relationship of Bi SACs, which can be utilized to establish control over CO2RR product distributions, and highlights the promise for engineering atomic coordination environments of SACs to tune reaction pathways.</description>

Ex&#8208;situ structural elucidations reveal the presence of abundant grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8208;S bonds from the covellite phase during CO2RR. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that S&#8208;S bonds can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates, further improving the activity of the formate pathway.

                Experimental and numerical evaluation of steam and carbon dioxide gasification on torrefied palm kernel shell in an updraft fixed bed gasifier is studied. Euler-Lagrangian two-dimensional model with 15 kinetic reactions is developed to investigate tar formation in relation to torrefaction temperature, gasification temperature, and steam-to-carbon-dioxide ratio (S-CO2-R). The combination of steam and CO2 had considerable effect on the tar reduction and also influenced the gaseous composition significantly when the varying parameters were compared. The results show that increasing both gasification temperature and S-CO2-R do enhance the H2 production whiles drastically reducing the tar formation. The tar concentration reduced by 21.4 % and 20.5 % by changing the S-CO2-R from 0.4 to 2.0 and gasification process temperature from 973 and 1173 K respectively. An increase in hydrogen is also observed, from 55.5 % to 60.84 %, when the S-CO2-R is increased to 1.2. Similarly, 29.1 % increase is observed in gasification efficiency as compared to the raw-PKS.</description>

      <title>N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ Sites for C1/C2 Selectivity Regulation of Carbon Dioxide Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>

                Controlling the valence states of copper is pivotal in determining the selectivity of products in CO2 electroreduction. In this study, we developed a Cu doped carbon catalyst (CuNC) derived from a metal-organic framework (MOFs) through a straightforward solution reaction and calcination method. The N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ sites exhibited adjustable C1 and C2 selectivity in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction (CER). Specifically, the CuNC-700 demonstrated an impressive C2 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 56.0% at -1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a remarkable C1 FE of 56.7% with a total current density of 600 mA/cm2 at -1.6 V vs RHE. In the entire potential range, the CuNC-700 consistently maintained high FE values of &gt; 92% for CER, while the FE values for hydrogen evolution reaction is below 8%. This study unveiled the correlation between the selectivity and the valence states of copper. At low applied potentials, the abundance of N-modulated Cu0-Cu+ sites led to the predominant production of the C2 products. The Cu0 played a primary role in activating CO2 and facilitating subsequent electron transfer, while the Cu+ enhanced the adsorption of *CO, further promoting the C-C coupling. Under high applied potentials, both Cu2+ and Cu+ were converted to Cu0, favoring the methanation process. This research paves the way for future design of Cu-based MOF-derived materials, enabling precise regulation of C1/C2 selectivity in CER.</description>

                Excessive CO2 emission has caused serious environmental problems, and converting CO2 to high value-added fuels is attractive for solving energy and environmental crisis. Herein, a novel mesoporous TS-1(mTS-1) zeolite-confined metal oxides nanoclusters Cu-Bi@mTS-1 was developed for efficient photoelectrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (PEC CO2RR). The catalyst Cu-Bi@mTS-1 as a photocathode showed high activity, achieving a maximum methanol Faraday efficiency (FECH3OH) of 93.4% at -0.7 V vs. RHE. In-situ Raman results indicate the formation of key reaction intermediates *OCH3 and *CHO during the conversion of CO2 to CH3OH. The C2 product ethanol could be also detected at higher potentials during PEC CO2RR. It is believed that the hierarchically porous structure of mTS-1 is conducive to the enrichment of CO2 molecules to increase the reactant concentration, also can promote C-C coupling through photoelectric synergism. This work provides a favorable reference for the rational design of photocathodes by confinement effect of porous structure.</description>

      <title>Design of highly selective and stable CsPbI3 perovskite catalyst for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to C1 product</title>

                Finding efficient photocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction catalysts is one of the core issues in addressing global climate change. Herein, the pristine CsPbI3 perovskite and doped CsPbI3 perovskite were evaluated in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to C1 products by using density functional theory. Free energy testing and electronic structure analysis methods have shown that doped CsPbI3 exhibits more effective catalytic performance, higher selectivity, and stability than undoped CsPbI3. Additionally, it is discovered that CsPbI3 (100) and (110) crystal surfaces have varied product selectivity. The photo-catalytic effectiveness is increased by the narrower band gap of Bi and Sn doped CsPbI3, which broadens the absorption spectrum of visible light and makes electron transport easier. The calculation results indicate that Bi doped CsPbI3 (100) and CsPbI3 (110) crystal faces exhibit good selectivity towards CH4, with free energy barriers as low as 0.55 eV and 0.58 eV, respectively. Sn doped CsPbI3 (100) and CsPbI3 (110) crystal planes exhibit good selectivity for HCOOH and CH3OH, respectively. The results indicate that the Bi and Sn doped CsPbI3 perovskite catalyst can further improve the CO2 photocatalytic activity and high selectivity for C1 products, making it a suitable substrate material for high-performance CO2RR.</description>

      <title>Effect of Co2 Shortage on the Performance of Membrane Electrode Co2 Electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4695651</link>

                To mitigate greenhouse effects, carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been used as an efficient means of carbon reduction. In CO2 electrolyzer, CO2 shortage can happen and degrade the reaction efficiency. Herein, an efficient and long-lived formic acid three-cell electrolyzer is used to study the effect of CO2 shortage, by operating the electrolyzer from full CO2 supply to CO2 shortage. In addition, the effects of various CO2 fluxes and concentrations on the electrolyzer current, acid concentration and lifetime are investigated. The results demonstrated that the electrolyzer current and the CO to H2 ratio both decreases from full CO2 to CO2 shortage, indicating that the reactivity of converting CO2 into formic acid ions is weakened. On the contrary, the hydrogen evolution reaction is intensified. Long-term CO2 shortage also cause the catalyst to detach and agglomerate in the cathode catalyst layer, reducing its active surface area and overall performance. Compared with the CO2 flux, the CO2 concentration exerts a more pronounced influence. To ensure the electrolysis efficiency, the carbon dioxide concentration should not be less than 80 %.</description>

      <title>Nature AND Nurture: Enabling formate-dependent growth in Methanosarcina acetivorans</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.08.574737</link>

                Methanogens are essential players in the global carbon cycle. Methanosarcinales possess one of the most diverse metabolic repertoires for methanogenesis, but they have never been observed to utilize formate as a substrate. We successfully reprogrammed the primary metabolism of Methanosarcina acetivorans by introducing an exogenous formate dehydrogenase derived from a closely related species. The engineered strains acquired the capacity to harness energy from formate-dependent methanogenesis pathways, including formate-dependent methyl reduction and formate-dependent carbon dioxide reduction. The ability of M. acetivorans to thrive on formate suggests the existence of essential accessory machinery and metabolic redundancy for generating reduced ferredoxins from F420H2. This remarkable plasticity in energy metabolism raises the possibility that an ancestral lineage of Methanosarcinales may have possessed the capacity to utilize formate. By combining this genetically modified strain with a disruption in methyl disproportionation, we have created a novel tool for investigating and manipulating the components of the F420 reduction and methanogenesis pathways independently.</description>

      <title>Peeking into the Femtosecond Hot-Carrier Dynamics Reveals Unexpected Mechanisms in Plasmonic Photocatalysis</title>

                Plasmonic-driven photocatalysis may lead to reaction selectivity that cannot be otherwise achieved. A fundamental role is played by hot carriers, i.e., electrons and holes generated upon plasmonic decay within the metal nanostructure interacting with molecular species. Understanding the elusive microscopic mechanism behind such selectivity is a key step in the rational design of hot-carrier reactions. To accomplish that, we present state-of-the-art multiscale simulations, going beyond density functional theory, of hot-carrier injections for the rate-determining step of a photocatalytic reaction. We focus on carbon dioxide reduction, for which it was experimentally shown that the presence of a rhodium nanocube under illumination leads to the selective production of methane against carbon monoxide. We show that selectivity is due to a (predominantly) direct hole injection from rhodium to the reaction intermediate CHO. Unexpectedly, such an injection does not promote the selective reaction path by favoring proper bond breaking but rather by promoting bonding of the proper molecular fragment to the surface.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR) is gaining momentum as an effective process to capture and convert CO 2 into valuable chemicals and fuels, as well as to contribute reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes) are increasingly attracting attention as CO 2 RR electrocatalysts due to their enhanced chemical activity and selectivity, overcoming limitations of traditional metal CO 2 RR electrocatalysts, and likely breaking the scaling relations of reaction intermediates toward the desired product. The present concept reviews the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the computational description of CO 2 RR on MXenes, going from CO 2 activation on pristine models to different surface terminations, and discuss possible ways to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity, including doping, defects, supported single metal atoms, solvent effects, and electric field effects, while putting in the spotlight prospects by including kinetic aspects.</description>

                Carbon capture and conversion are becoming increasingly important as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise and their adverse effects become increasingly evident. CO2 conversion/utilization-related research has gained renewed interest on a variety of platforms, including thermal, solar, biological, photochemical, and electrochemical conversions. Electrochemical routes, using suitable catalysts, are potentially suitable for commercial purposes owing to ease of integration with solvent-based carbon capture processes. This paper summarizes and evaluates the studies conducted within the past decade regarding the feasibility of carbon-based supports utilized in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. CO2 conversion has been reviewed in a number of reports, focusing on specific sections, such as metallic/bimetallic catalysts, CO2 solubility, and the fabrication of electrodes and electrochemical cells. The number of publications addressing various carbon-based electrocatalysts is increasing, but these materials have not yet been reviewed. Herein, we are focused on three types of electrocatalyst materials: metals, metal-oxides, non-oxides, and combinations thereof with carbon. The scope of this study includes the following: i) carbon-based materials and how they are characterized by distinctive properties, ii) electrocatalytic CO2 conversion techniques, and iii) research cases for carbon allotrope-supported composites used in CO2 reduction. The advancement in analytical tools that provide insight into liquid-phase reactions will benefit the development of catalysts and electrodes that will be effective in converting CO2 into the desired products. Such developments will also be applicable to other systems involving liquid electrolytes or solvents for performing reactions on catalyst surfaces.</description>

      <title>ATR&#8211;SEIRAS Method to Measure Interfacial pH during Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction on Cu</title>

                This study reports the accuracy and applications of an attenuated total reflectance&#8211;surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8211;SEIRAS) technique to indirectly measure the interfacial pH of the electrolyte using the ratio of phosphate species within 10 nm of the electrocatalyst surface. This technique can be used in situ to study aqueous electrochemical reactions with a calibration range from pH 1&#8211;13, time resolution down to 4 s, and an average 95% confidence interval of 14% that varies depending on the pH region (acidic, neutral, or basic). The method is applied in this study to electrochemical nitrate reduction at a copper cathode to demonstrate its capabilities, but is broadly applicable to any aqueous electrochemical reaction (such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, or oxygen evolution) and the electrocatalyst may be any SEIRAS-active thin film (e.g., silver, gold, or copper). The time-resolved results show a dramatic increase in the interfacial pH from pH 2&#8211;7 in the first minute of operation during both constant current and pulsed current experiments where the bulk pH is unchanged. Attempts to control the pH polarization at the surface by altering the electrochemical operating conditions&#8212;lowering the current or increasing the pulse frequency&#8212;showed no significant change, demonstrating the challenge of controlling the interfacial pH.</description>

      <title>A global synthesis of reported urban tree carbon production rates and approaches</title>

                Trees are a prominent feature of urban ecosystems. Urban tree productivity is a key component of urban ecosystem energetics and has been identified as a possible pathway for reducing global greenhouse gas concentrations. Recently, extensive research has been directed to evaluating the carbon dynamics of urban trees in cities throughout the world. Here, we synthesize this research, using results from previous studies from 154 cities to identify the distribution of urban tree productivity globally and the basis for generating urban tree productivity estimates. Reported urban tree productivity shows a strong relationship with estimated tree carbon content and exhibits increases with both temperature and precipitation, with land cover differences influencing the degree of climate sensitivity. Compared with a reference productivity estimate, urban trees showed greatly reduced estimated rates of productivity and the magnitude of reduced productivity was inversely correlated with precipitation but was independent of temperature. Reported rates of productivity across all studies suggest climate restrictions that are more important with less intensively managed land covers. Scaling these results globally suggests a limited opportunity for urban trees to contribute to atmospheric carbon dioxide reductions, especially in the absence of major carbon emission reductions. We found that the majority of results are derived from tree inventories from a single period with rates of productivity estimate through quasi-empirical or allometric models. The majority of studies have been conducted in temperate biomes and North America. These results show that existing urban tree assessments have substantial methodological restrictions and regional biases. Future research of urban tree productivity should look toward improved methods and can use this synthesis as a baseline for comparisons and improvement.</description>

                Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (ECO2RR) converts CO2 into value-added chemicals or fuels to realize carbon recycling as means to solve the problems of renewable energy shortage and environmental pollution. The development of cost-effective CO2RR catalysts with high activity, stability and selectivity is the key that enables efficient conversion from CO2 to valuable products. It is also important to understand intrinsic mechanisms of the underlying active-site that affect the performances of catalysts, which can, in turn, facilitate the rational design of more active electrocatalysts. In this context, it is particularly important to understand the structure-activity relationship of catalyst active sites during the CO2RR process from different atomic-scales, which inspires to organize this review. Specifically, we focus on the atomic-level construction of active sites from single atoms, dual-site metal, clusters, or/and graphitic carbon materials: key approaches for tailoring coordination configurations to enhance target product selectivity, i.e., optimizing the interplay between the catalytic active center and reactants or intermediates, disrupting the linear correlation of intermediate adsorption energies, and promoting intricate cascading reactions involving multiple intermediates. Highlight the intricate correlation between the structure-activity of CO2RR catalysts, which govern the discerning refinement of catalysts and propel advances in their practical application. Then, the electrocatalytic reactors for ECO2R reactions are critically reviewed. The acquisition of key metrics, the challenges faced, and the most suitable solutions for electrocatalytic CO2RR are proposed. Finally, future research directions and strategies are anticipated to inspire revolutionary advancements.</description>

      <title>Site Selection Evaluation of Co2 Storage in Saline Aquifers of Zhuyi Depression, the Pearl River Mouth Basin</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4691481</link>

                CO2 geological storage is the primary means of achieving large-scale, low-cost carbon dioxide reduction. Compared with onshore basins, sequestration in offshore basins has the advantages of larger storage volume and less impact on people and the environment. At the same time, there are also challenges such as high cost and technical difficulty for sequestration. At present, there are many researches on the selection and suitability evaluation of CCS in China, and there are also very successful demonstration applications, while the research on CO2 geological storage in sea areas is relatively few. Taking Zhuyi Depression of Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South China Sea as an example in this paper, with the goal of meeting the storage capacity of one million tons per year. Making statistics on the factors affecting the suitability of CO2 storage of oil and gas-bearing structures in the depression from three aspects: geological characteristics, storage economy and storage safety, and constructs a screening index system of CO2 geological storage field, which includes 3 levels and 18 evaluation factors. The index weight of each evaluation factor is calculated by AHP. The suitability of CO2 sealing of selected oil and gas-bearing structures is quantitatively evaluated by multi-source information overlap analysis. The results show that the Xijiang 23 and other oil-bearing structures in the west of Huizhou Sag have priority as the storage field. The results of this study can provide reference for the implementation and management decision of CO2 saline aquifers storage in this area.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction by borophene supported bimetallic catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.01.051</link>
      <description>Meiling Liu, Jayaraman Balamurugan, Tongxiang Liang, Chao Liu, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390766525

                Bimetal atom catalysts (BACs) hold significant potential for various applications as a result of the synergistic interaction between adjacent metal atoms. This interaction leads to improved catalytic performance, while simultaneously maintaining high atomic efficiency and exceptional selectivity, similar to single atom catalysts (SACs). Bimetallic site catalysts (M2&#946;12) supported by &#946;12-borophene were developed as catalysts for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The research on density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that M2&#946;12 exhibits exceptional stability, conductivity, and catalytic activity. Investigating the most efficient reaction pathway for CO2RR by analyzing the Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) during potential determining steps (PDS) and choosing a catalyst with outstanding catalytic performance for CO2RR. The overpotential required for Fe2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 to generate CO is merely 0.05 V. This implies that the conversion of CO2 to CO can be accomplished with minimal additional voltage. The overpotential values for Cu2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 during the formation of HCOOH were merely 0.001 and 0.07 V, respectively. Furthermore, the Rh2&#946;12 catalyst exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 0.51 V for CH3OH and 0.65 V for CH4. The Fe2&#946;12 produces C2H4 through the *CO-*CO pathway, while Ag2&#946;12 generates CH3CH2OH via the *CO-*CHO coupling pathway, with remarkably low overpotentials of 0.84 and 0.60 V, respectively. The study provides valuable insights for the systematic design and screening of electrocatalysts for CO2RR that exhibit exceptional catalytic performance and selectivity.</description>

                Although interfacial solvation plays an important role in determining carbon dioxide reduction CO2 kinetics, present understanding of the potential dependent properties of the electrochemical double layer under conditions relevant for CO2R remains limited. This article summarizes the development and recent applications of plasmon&#8208;enhanced vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) spectroscopy to study the effects of cation hydration and interfacial solvation on CO2&#8203;R using CO as a vibrational Stark reporter. Results show that electrolyte cations retain their entire solvation shell upon adsorption to inactive sites, while active sites retain only a single water layer between the gold surface and the cation. Measurements also show that the total interfacial electric field can be separated into two contributions: one from the electrochemical double layer (Stern field) and another from the polar solvation environment (Onsager field). Surprisingly, correlating VSFG spectra with reaction kinetics reveals that it is the solvation&#8208;mediated Onsager field that governs the chemical reactivity at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Measuring the interfacial water spectra during electrocatalysis also provides evidence for the proton source during H2 evolution, which competes with CO2&#8203;R in aqueous electrolyte. These findings highlight the importance of directly probing cation hydration and interfacial solvation, which mediates reaction kinetics at electrochemical interfaces.</description>

                This research discusses theoretically the relationship between carbon tax with economy, tax and environment. This research is a legal research with analytical descriptive nature, namely research that analyzes secondary data on issues related to carbon taxes as an instrument for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. According to secondary data, this research is aimed at discovering aspects of carbon tax design, collection of carbon taxes, and state management of carbon tax revenues. Carbon taxes are an effective and efficient instrument to support the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. To be implemented, a carbon tax must be feasible. Eligibility requires public acceptance. On the other hand, a carbon tax can create a lot of controversy. The main argument against carbon taxes is that carbon taxes do not always guarantee emission reductions. In addition, there are also concerns over the unintended effects of competitiveness, carbon leakage, and fears of unintended distributional impacts, which could be barriers to implementation.</description>

                China&#8217;s transition to a green, low-carbon economy is among the most essential elements needed to achieve the climate goals set down in the Paris Agreement. China has pledged it &#8220;will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060&#8221;.1 Given the currently high emissions level in China and an economic structure with significant share of industrial sector and fossil fuel consumption, it remains a formidable challenge to realize such steep emission reduction for the 30-60 goals, as we call them in this paper.</description>
