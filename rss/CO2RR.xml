      <title>From CO2 to solid carbon: reaction mechanism, active species, and conditioning the Ce-alloyed GaInSn catalyst</title>

                The electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising realisation of negative emissions to mitigate climate change, aiming at the efficient production and safe longterm storage of carbon-rich sink products. This approach, however, necessitates novel catalyst materials specifically targeting electrochemical carbon dioxide removal. In this work, we investigate synthesis routes for a cerium-incorporated GaInSn-based liquid metal catalyst, focusing on the electrochemical production of graphitic carbon. Preparation and preconditioning of the catalyst are found to be crucial for carbon production, while trace amounts of H2O and OH in the organic electrolyte play a decisive role for the efficiency of the electrocatalytic process. Finally, for a better understanding of the reaction mechanism and the involved active species, experimental findings and density functional theory-based calculations are combined, suggesting a two-step reduction pathway with Ce(OH)x as the catalytically active surface species.</description>

      <title>Research on Cu-Site Modification of g-C3N4/CeO2-like Z-Scheme Heterojunction for Enhancing CO2 Reduction and Mechanism Insight</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14080546</link>

                In this work, the successful synthesis of a Cu@g-C3N4/CeO2-like Z-scheme heterojunction through hydrothermal and photo-deposition methods represents high CO2 reduction activity with remarkable CO selectivity, as evidenced by the impressive CO yield of 33.8 &#956;mol/g for Cu@g-C3N4/CeO2, which is over 10 times higher than that of g-C3N4 and CeO2 individually. The characterization and control experimental results indicate that the formation of heterojunctions and the introduction of Cu sites promote charge separation and the transfer of hot electrons, as well as the photothermal effect, which are the essential reasons for the improved CO2 reduction activity. Remarkably, Cu@g-C3N4/CeO2 still exhibits about 92% performance even after multiple cycles. In situ FTIR was utilized to confirm the production of COOH* at 1472 cm&#8722;1 and to elucidate the mechanism behind the high selectivity for CO production. The study&#8217;s investigation into the wide-ranging applicability of the Cu@g-C3N4/CeO2-like Z-scheme heterojunction catalysts is noteworthy, and the exploration of potential reaction mechanisms for CO2 reduction adds valuable insights to the field of catalysis.</description>

                Plant responses to changing environments afford complex regulation at transcriptome and proteome level to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Homeostasis itself constitutes a complex and dynamic equilibrium of metabolic reactions and transport processes among cellular compartments. In the present study, we aimed at the highest possible resolution of this network by combining analysis of transcriptome, proteome and subcellular resolved metabolome of plants exposed to rising carbon dioxide concentrations over a time course of one week. To prove suitability of our approach, we included mutants affected in photorespiratory metabolism and, thus, should deviate from the wildtype in their response to elevated CO2. Our multi-omics analysis revealed that the hpr1-1 mutant, defective in peroxisomal hydroxypyruvate reduction, is also affected in cytosolic pyruvate metabolism, reaching out to cysteine synthesis, while the hexokinase mutant hxk1 displays a disturbed redox balance upon changing CO2 levels. For the third mutant, defective in the mitochondrial protein BOU, we found compelling evidence that the function of this transporter is related to lipoic acid metabolism, thus challenging current interpretations. This demonstrates that the combined omics approach introduced here opens new insights into complex metabolic interaction of pathways shared among different cellular compartments.</description>

      <title>The impact of the European Union emissions trading system on carbon dioxide emissions: a matrix completion analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-70260-6</link>
      <description>Francesco Biancalani, Giorgio Gnecco, Rodolfo Metulini, Massimo Riccaboni, Scientific Reports. 14(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401850351

                Despite the negative externalities on the environment and human health, today's economies still produce excessive carbon dioxide emissions. As a result, governments are trying to shift production and consumption to more sustainable models that reduce the environmental impact of carbon dioxide emissions. The European Union, in particular, has implemented an innovative policy to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by creating a market for emission rights, the emissions trading system. The objective of this paper is to perform a counterfactual analysis to measure the impact of the emissions trading system on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. For this purpose, a recently-developed statistical machine learning method called matrix completion with fixed effects estimation is used and compared to traditional econometric techniques. We apply matrix completion with fixed effects estimation to the prediction of missing counterfactual entries of a carbon dioxide emissions matrix whose elements (indexed row-wise by country and column-wise by year) represent emissions without the emissions trading system for country-year pairs. The results obtained, confirmed by robust diagnostic tests, show a significant effect of the emissions trading system on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions: the majority of European Union countries included in our analysis reduced their total carbon dioxide emissions (associated with selected industries) by about 15.4% during the emissions trading system treatment period 2005&#8211;2020, compared to the total carbon dioxide emissions (associated with the same industries) that would have been achieved in the absence of the emissions trading system policy. Finally, several managerial/practical implications of the study are discussed, together with its possible extensions.</description>

                This study compares thermodynamics, economics, and environmental performance of cascaded ORCs operated under a single and dual fluids. In the single fluid cascaded ORC, toluene, benzene, acetone and cyclopentane are run in high and low temperature cycles, whereas in dual fluid cascaded ORC, toluene, benzene, acetone and cyclopentane are run in high temperature cycle and R601a in the low temperature cycle. The analysis compares variations in expander inlet temperature and condensation temperature. Thermodynamic performance involved net power output (Pnet) and thermal efficiency (&#951;th), while economic indicators included net present value (NPV) and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). In environmental performance, the annual reduction in carbon dioxide emission (CO2-eq) is assessed. The findings revealed that dual fluid cascaded ORC generated the highest Pnet of 1245.11 kW while single fluid cascaded ORC reached 1170.27 kW. The dual fluid cascaded ORC showed the significant increase in Pnet (%DPnet) for about 43% at the lowest expander inlet temperature (500 K). In terms of &#951;th, dual fluid cascaded ORC attained 37.23 % while single fluid cascaded ORC reached 33.25%. It is further found that acetone+R601a performed well in dual fluid cascaded ORC, resulting in the highest Pnet and allowing system&#8217;s NPV to turn positive sooner than other fluids. Furthermore, cyclopentane+R601a had the lowest LCOE of 0.0158 US$/kWh, which is 1.1% lower compared to the single fluid cascaded ORC and competitive in the Thai electricity market. In environmental saving, dual fluid cascaded ORC reduced about 144.96 tCO2-eq/year, and outperformed single fluid cascaded ORC by roughly 6.39%.</description>

                Abstract Practical and energy-efficient carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) conversion to value-added and fuel-graded products and transitioning from fossil fuels are promising ways to cope with climate change and to enable the circular economy. The carbon circular economy aims to capture, utilize, and minimize CO 2 emissions as much as possible. To cope with the thermodynamic stability and highly endothermic nature of CO 2 conversion via conventional thermochemical process, the potential application of non-thermal plasma (NTP) with the catalyst, i.e., the hybrid plasma catalysis process to achieve the synergistic effects, in most cases, seems to promise alternatives under non-equilibrium conditions. This review focuses on the NTP fundamentals and comparison with conventional technologies. A critical review has been conducted on the CO 2 reduction with water (H 2 O), methane (CH 4 ) reduction with CO 2 to syngas (CO + H 2 ), CO 2 dissociation to carbon monoxide (CO), CO 2 hydrogenation, CO 2 conversion to organic acids, and one-step CO 2 &#8211;CH 4 reforming to the liquid chemicals. Finally, future challenges are discussed comprehensively, indicating that plasma catalysis has immense investigative areas.</description>

                The ever-increasing expansion of chemical industries produces a variety of common pollutants, including colors, which become a global and environmental problem. Using a nanocatalyst is one of the effective ways to reduce these organic contaminants. With this in mind, a straightforward and effective method for the production of a novel nanocatalyst based on lignin-derived carbon, titanium dioxide nanoparticles, and Ag particles (TiO2/C/Ag) is described. The preparation of carbon and Ag particles (in sub-micro and nano size) was carried out by laser ablation in air. The nanocomposite was synthesized using a facile magnetic stirrer of TiO2, C, and Ag. According to characterization methods, a carbon nanostructure was successfully synthesized through the laser irradiation of lignin. According to scanning electron microscope images, spherical Ag particles were agglomerated over the nanocomposite. The catalytic activities of the TiO2/C/Ag nanocomposite were tested for the decolorization of methylene blue (MB) and Congo red (CR), employing NaBH4 in a water-based solution at 25 &#176;C. After adding fresh NaBH4 to the mixture of nanocomposite and dyes, both UV absorption peaks of MB and CR completely disappeared after 10 s and 4 min, respectively. The catalytic activity of the TiO2/C/Ag nanocomposite was also examined for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) using a NaBH4 reducing agent, suggesting the complete reduction of 4-NP to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) after 2.30 min. This shows excellent catalytic behavior of the prepared nanocomposite in the reduction of organic pollutants.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Mechanism of Converting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into Methanol by the Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and Oxygen Vacancy on MgO: Experiments and Density Functional Theory</title>

                Given the great significance of defect and Cu compounds for the reduction of CO2 as well as the few reaction mechanisms of converting CO2 into different hydrocarbons, the effects of oxygen vacancies and Cu2O on the reduction of CO2 were thoroughly investigated, and possible mechanisms were also proposed. A series of Cu2O/Ov-MgO catalysts were synthesized for photothermal catalytic reduction of CO2 to methanol under visible-light irradiation, among which the 7%Cu2O/Ov-MgO composite exhibited the best reduction activity and the yield of methanol was 19.78 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8211;1&#183;h&#8211;1. The successful composite of Cu2O and Ov-MgO can yield a loose and porous nanosheet, uniform distribution, favorable absorbance and photoelectric performance, and increased specific surface area and adsorption ability of CO2, which are all vital to the adsorption and conversion of CO2. The introduction of oxygen vacancy and Cu2O not only promotes the adsorption of CO2 but also provides more electron-triggered CO2 activation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation was also performed to reveal the reaction mechanism for effective enhanced CO2 reduction to ethanol or methanol by the comparison of CuO/MgO and Cu2O/Ov-MgO composites, illustrating the reaction pathways of different products. By comparing the key steps in determining the selectivity of C1 or C2, the kinetic barriers of obtaining CH3OH for the Cu2O/Ov-MgO composite with CH3OH as the main product were found to be lower than those of generating CH2*, while the opposite is true for CuO/MgO composites, whereby it may be easier to obtain more C2 products. These insights into the reaction mechanism of converting CO2 into different hydrocarbons are expected to provide guidance for the further design of high-performance photothermal catalytic CO2 reduction catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Background In-hospital promotion of the oral route and IV to oral switch (IVOST)1 are key antimicrobial stewardship (AS) initiatives providing benefits for patients, staff and the environment, including reduced risk of line infections, medicine costs, nursing workload and plastic waste.1,2 A recent quality improvement (QI) initiative highlighting the environmental sustainability benefits of switching to oral metronidazole (bioavailability &amp;gt;90%) in surgical wards at the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH) resulted in a 45% median reduction in IV administrations.3 Objectives To scale and spread this QI initiative to all inpatient wards in NHSGGC Clyde hospitals (RAH, Inverclyde Royal and Vale of Leven) and measure the impact on AS, drug costs, nursing workload and environmental sustainability. Methods A QI scale and spread approach was used including: targeted pharmacist/pharmacy technician prospective audit and feedback; presentations to medical, nursing and pharmacy teams; eye-catching posters on wards/electronic guideline platform; staff champions; and HEPMA IVOST prompts when prescribing or administering IV metronidazole.4 Oral and IV metronidazole usage data was calculated at baseline and for 36 months post-change. Benefits in terms of reduced IV administrations, drug costs and nursing time saved5 were calculated. Plastic waste reduction (giving sets, single use plastic containers, cannula, safety needles, gloves and aprons) associated with switching from IV to oral metronidazole was calculated in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions using a hybrid carbon footprinting methodology and emissions factor databases.6,7 Results There was a 64% median reduction in IV metronidazole defined daily doses (DDDs) (Figure 1) equating to 1977 and 23 724 fewer IV metronidazole administrations monthly and annually, respectively. The equivalent nursing time saved was 659 h per month and 7908 h per year. There was a 26% median shift in percentage IV metronidazole of total (IV plus oral) use (Figure 2). There was a 38% median reduction in metronidazole drug cost (Figure 3). The carbon footprint saving achieved from switching from IV to oral metronidazole was calculated as 1.48111 kg CO2e per dose, equating to 2928 kg CO2e per month and an annual carbon footprint saving of 35.1 tonnes CO2e; refer to Table 1 for equivalents. Conclusions A QI scale and spread approach to raise awareness of the multidisciplinary team to the benefits of appropriate switch from IV to oral metronidazole resulted in a change in prescribing behaviour and a significant reduction in IV administrations. This is important in terms of improved AS, patient safety, workforce cost and efficiency and environmental sustainability.</description>

                Rutile-type Co0.5Ti0.5NbO4 (CTO)-based materials doped with Fe3+ or Ni2+ were investigated as cathode electrodes to modify their electrical conductivity and electrocatalysis toward CO2 splitting. Higher electric conductivity was found in Co0.4Fe0.2Ti0.4NbO4 (CTO-Fe, 0.78 S cm&#8211;1) and Co0.25Ni0.25Ti0.5NbO4 (CTO-Ni, 2.10 S cm&#8211;1) compared to CTO (0.49 S cm&#8211;1) after the reduction at 800 &#176;C in Ar-5% H2. Co and Co&#8211;Ni particles exsolved in situ from the surface of CTO, CTO-Fe, and CTO-Ni after reduction. CTO-Ni and CTO-Fe cathodes did better in the CO2 electrolysis at 800 &#176;C than the CTO one, but the CTO-Ni cell was unstable after 10 h of operation due to the carbon deposition that blocked the electrode. The cell with CTO-Fe demonstrated a good stability for CO2 splitting in 100 h. This work demonstrates that rutile-type CTO-based cathodes are promising to provide an efficient and candidate oxide cathode for the electrolysis of CO2.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Dynamic Change and Driving Force of Vegetation Carbon Sink in Taihang Mountain, China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/land13091348</link>

                Vegetation plays an important role in absorbing carbon dioxide and accelerating the achievement of carbon neutrality. As the ecological barrier of North China, the Taihang Mountains are pivotal to the ecological construction project of China. Nevertheless, the dynamic development of the vegetation carbon sink in the region and the impact factors on the sink have not been systematically evaluated. This study employed a comprehensive approach, utilising remote sensing technology and meteorological and topographic data, in conjunction with the net ecosystem productivity (NEP) estimation model to reveal the characteristics of vegetation carbon sinks in the Taihang Mountain, and then revealed the dynamics evolution of the NEP and the inter-annual trend by using Theil&#8211;Sen Median slope estimation, the Mann&#8211;Kendall test, and the coefficient of dissociation and analysed the driving roles of the influencing factors by using the parameter optimal geographic detector. Our findings suggest that the NEP in the Taihang Mountain area has a clear growth trend in time, the average value of NEP in the Taihang Mountain area is 289 gC-m&#8722;2-a&#8722;1 from 2000 to 2022, and the spatial distribution shows the characteristics of high in the northeast and low in the middle and west, with a gradual increase from the northeast to the southwest; the areas with high fluctuation of NEP are mainly distributed in the areas around some cities that are susceptible to the interference of natural or anthropogenic factors. The vegetation carbon sinks in the Taihang Mountains are influenced by a variety of natural factors, among which the explanatory power of each natural factor is as follows: DEM (0.174) &gt; temperature (0.148) &gt; precipitation (0.026) &gt; slope (0.017) &gt; slope direction (0.003). The natural factor DEM had the strongest explanatory power for NEP changes, and the two-by-two effects of the natural factors on vegetation carbon sinks were all significantly stronger than the effects of a single factor, in which the interaction between DEM and precipitation had the strongest explanatory power; distinguishing from climate change factors, the contribution of anthropogenic activities to NEP changes in more than 90% of the area of the Taihang Mountainous Region was more than 60%, and the driving force of anthropogenic factors on NEP changes in the Taihang Mountainous Region was significantly stronger than that of natural climate change. The contribution of anthropogenic factors to NEP changes in the Taihang Mountains was significantly stronger than that of natural climate change. The results of this study can not only provide a reference for carbon reduction and sink increase and ecological restoration projects in the Taihang Mountains but also benefit the research paradigm of vegetation carbon sequestration in other regions.</description>

                Abstract Catalytic reactions mainly depend on the adsorption properties of reactants on the catalyst, which provides a perspective for the design of reversible lithium&#8722;carbon dioxide (Li&#8722;CO 2 ) batteries including CO 2 reduction (CO 2 RR) and CO 2 evolution (CO 2 ER) reactions. However, due to the complex reaction process, the relationship between the adsorption configuration and CO 2 RR/CO 2 ER catalytic activity is still unclear in Li &#9472; CO 2 batteries. Herein, taking Co 3 S 4 as a model system, nickel (Ni substitution in the tetrahedral site to activate cobalt (Co) atom for forming multiatom catalytic domains in NiCo 2 S 4 is utilized. Benefiting from the special geometric and electronic structures, NiCo 2 S 4 exhibits an optimized adsorption configuration of lithium carbonate (Li 2 CO 3 ), promoting its effective activation and decomposition. As a result, the Li&#8722;CO 2 batteries with NiCo 2 S 4 cathode exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance in terms of low potential gap of 0.42 V and high energy efficiency of 88.7%. This work provides a unique perspective for the development of highly efficient catalysts in Li&#8722;CO 2 batteries.</description>

      <description>Sairam Parthasarathy, Christopher J. Morton, Respiratory Care. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401908687

                Background: To test the ability of a low-pressure, low-flow, Heliox-based rebreathing system to reduce work of breathing and conserve gas while preserving CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity at physiological levels in a bench study. Methods: We performed a bench study of a novel low-pressure, low-flow, noninvasive Heliox rebreathing system with CO2 scrubber that was connected to an artificial lung simulator with careful monitoring of flow, pressure, work of breathing, oxygen (O2), carbon-dioxide (CO2), temperature, and humidity levels. Multiple runs of breathing were performed while manipulating levels of resistance (5 &#8211; 30 cm H2O/L/sec), gas mixtures (room air, 79% Helium 21% O2, and 70% Helium and 30% O2), and leak levels (ultra-low, low, and high). Results: We found significant reductions in work of breathing (up to 64%) while conserving gas with estimates of up to 54-fold reduction in medical gas wastage (P&lt;0.001). Specifically, at resistances of 5, 10, 20, and 30 cm H2O/L/sec we demonstrated 64%, 57%, 36%, and 7% reduction in work of breathing (P&lt;0.0001). Gas wastage was reduced by 10- to 54-fold while the end-tidal CO2 concentration, humidity, and temperature were maintained by the device at physiological levels. Conclusions: In a bench-test, a low-pressure, low-flow, noninvasive Heliox rebreathing system with CO2 scrubber reduced work of breathing and conserved gas while preserving CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity at physiological levels. Future studies in human subjects need to be performed to determine whether reduction of work of breathing and gas conservation can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Gas Accessibility via Macropore Engineering in Amine-Loaded Silica Particles for Enhanced CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Adsorption Performance</title>

                The urgent need to mitigate climate change has spurred the development of efficient adsorbents for CO2 capture. Porous solid sorbents, especially those incorporating amine-modified porous silica materials, offer a promising alternative due to their superior selectivity and reversibility. However, the existing research has focused on developing mesoporous silica for CO2 adsorption applications, often overlooking the role of macropores. One critical challenge with mesoporous silica is the restriction in the loading amount of amine due to low pore volume, which is followed by reduction of the CO2 capture capacity due to pore blocking and a decrease in surface area at high amine concentration. Macroporous silica particles offer promising advantages over mesopores in CO2 adsorption performance, including improved mass transfer kinetics and enhanced accessibility of CO2 to amine sites. Therefore, the CO2 adsorption capacity of porous silica materials may not have reached its full potential, and the influence of macropore sizes ranging from 60 to 400 nm has yet to be fully explored. This research, for the first time, aims to address current limitations in CO2 capture methodologies by engineering controllable porous silica particles with various macropore sizes utilizing a spray process followed by tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) modification. Results indicate that increasing TEPA concentration up to 70 wt % enhanced the CO2 adsorption capacity of the particles. The absorption performance was maximized in macroporous silica with a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) template size of 291 nm (6.08 mmol CO2/g of absorbent). Generally, larger macropore size facilitates CO2 diffusion within the particles, preventing the formation of inactive TEPA sites and reducing the CO2 diffusion resistance. This study not only highlights the relationship between the macroporous structure, TEPA modification, and CO2 adsorption capacity but also provides valuable insights for advancing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, emphasizing the potential of macroporous silica to overcome the inherent limitations of its mesoporous counterpart.</description>

      <title>Assessing Maize Yield Variability under Climate Change Using DSSAT Model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.9734/jsrr/2024/v30i92333</link>

                Crop production is inherently sensitive to variability in climate. Temperature and CO2 are two important parameters related to climate change, affecting crop yield in a particular region. In this study, an attempt has been made to assess the impact of these two parameters on the productivity of maize crop taking sub tropical region of Jammu as study area. A CERES-Maize model 4.0 was used for this purpose. Three-year weather data (2004-06) is used to simulate the actual yield under rainfed and irrigated conditions. Yield was simulated with elevated temperature (1, 3 and 5oC) and CO2 (440, 550 and 660 ppm) during the growing season. As changes in CO2 concentration and temperature likely to occur concomitantly, so growth and development of maize plant at three temperature regimes (1, 3 and 5oC) under double (660 ppm) CO2 concentration to the baseline (330 ppm) was also assessed. The difference in yield, biomass, grain number and LAI was estimated and analyzed to assess the effect of elevated temperature and CO2. Results revealed that the rise in temperature accelerated plant phenology, reducing dry matter accumulation and crop yield by 5 to 60 per cent. Elevation of CO2 in the level of 440, 550 and 660 ppm showed gradual yield increment of 2.01, 3.92 and 5.37 per cent under rainfed conditions and 2.33, 4.52 and 7.41 per cent under irrigated conditions, respectively. Doubled CO2 increased yield at all the temperature rise situation and completely mitigated the yield and biomass reduction due to temperature rise up to 1oC.</description>

                Electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 is a promising process to produce renewable chemical feedstocks, such as CO, formic acid, ethylene, and ethanol. To overcome mass transfer limitations imposed by the low solubility of CO2 in the liquid phase, gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) are used to ensure an adequate supply of CO2. The gas&#8211;liquid interface within the GDEs is crucial for achieving high selectivity and stability of CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), but it is prone to flooding, which can terminate the reactions. Here, we built electrochemical models of silver-based and copper-based GDEs for studying intrinsic factors related to flooding. Our results reveal that there is a narrow "pressure window" for CO2RR, which has a negative correlation with current density. We further define three regions based on the "pressure window": the bubbling zone, the normal working condition zone, and the permeable zone. Our research shows that the bubbling zone offers better selectivity for gaseous products, while the permeable zone favors the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. Furthermore, electrochemical characterization testing investigated the characteristics of each zone and its impact on CO2RR.</description>

                Abstract. The rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) would decrease in response to decrease of anthropogenic emissions or cessation (net zero emissions) is of great scientific and societal interest. Such decrease in atmospheric CO2 on the centennial scale would be due essentially entirely to transfer of carbon into the world ocean (WO) and the terrestrial biosphere (TB), which are sink compartments on this time scale. The rate of decrease of excess atmospheric CO2 and the apportionment of this decrease into the two sink compartments has been examined in two prior model intercomparison studies, subsequent either to a pulse emission of CO2 or to abrupt cessation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The present study examines and quantifies inter-model anticorrelation in those studies in the net rate and extent of uptake of CO2 into the two sink compartments. Specifically, in each study the time-dependent coefficients characterizing the net transfer rate into the two sink compartments, (evaluated as the net transfer rate normalized to excess atmospheric CO2 above pre-pulse amount, for the pulse experiment; or as the net transfer rate divided by excess atmospheric CO2 above preindustrial amount, for the abrupt cessation experiment) was found to exhibit strong anticorrelation across the participating models. That is, models for which the normalized rate of uptake into the WO was high exhibited low uptake rate into the TB, and vice versa. This anticorrelation in net transfer rate results in anticorrelation in net uptake extent into the two compartments that is substantially greater than would be expected simply from competition for excess CO2 between the two sink compartments. This anticorrelation, which is manifested in diminished inter-model diversity, can lead to artificially enhanced confidence in current understanding of the consequences of potential future reductions of CO2 emissions and in the global warming potentials of non-CO2 greenhouse gases relative to that of CO2.</description>

The rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) would decrease in response to decrease of anthropogenic emissions or cessation (net zero emissions) is of great scientific and societal interest. Such decrease in atmospheric CO2 on the centennial scale would be due essentially entirely to transfer of carbon into the world ocean (WO) and the terrestrial biosphere (TB), which are sink compartments on this time scale. The rate of decrease of excess atmospheric CO2 and the apportionment of this decrease into the two sink compartments has been examined in two prior model intercomparison studies, subsequent either to a pulse emission of CO2 or to abrupt cessation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The present study examines and quantifies inter-model anticorrelation in those studies in the net rate and extent of uptake of CO2 into the two sink compartments. Specifically, in each study the time-dependent coefficients characterizing the net transfer rate into the two sink compartments, (evaluated as the net transfer rate normalized to excess atmospheric CO2 above pre-pulse amount, for the pulse experiment; or as the net transfer rate divided by excess atmospheric CO2 above preindustrial amount, for the abrupt cessation experiment) was found to exhibit strong anticorrelation across the participating models. That is, models for which the normalized rate of uptake into the WO was high exhibited low uptake rate into the TB, and vice versa. This anticorrelation in net transfer rate results in anticorrelation in net uptake extent into the two compartments that is substantially greater than would be expected simply from competition for excess CO2 between the two sink compartments. This anticorrelation, which is manifested in diminished inter-model diversity, can lead to artificially enhanced confidence in current understanding of the consequences of potential future reductions of CO2 emissions and in the global warming potentials of non-CO2 greenhouse gases relative to that of CO2.</description>

                Co-electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 and nitrate/nitrite as carbon and nitrogen sources to synthesize urea is an effective strategy to solve the energy problem and alleviate environmental pollution. In this work, combined density functional theory calculations with a constant-potential implicit solvent model, we proposed a strategy for the determination of the preferred reaction pathway and the potential window that is guided by the potential-dependent free energy change. It was found that on the FeNi-N6-C surface, the C&#8211;N coupling occurs between *NHO and the protonated CO2 in the potential window of &#8722;2.43 to &#8722;1.34 V for the urea electrochemical production, where the predicted onset potential accords well with the experimental results. The activity originates from the less weak bonding strength of N&#8211;O and the negatively charged N atom in *NHO. This study offers a general approach to determining the optimal reaction pathway in electrochemistry and insights into the mechanism of electrochemical synthesis of urea.</description>

                One of the main agents responsible for global warming is greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) associated with fuel combustion.Most works in the literature address logistics transportation from an economic perspective, giving little attention to the existing trade-off with sustainability.In this work, we develop two bi-objective mathematical models, one for the inventory routing problem with a heterogeneous fleet and another for the multimodal freight transportation problem, where we minimize costs while simultaneously reducing CO 2 emissions.First, we present an explicit vehicular equation that can statistically estimate CO 2 emissions for different vehicles and types of fuels.Next, we apply two bi-objective methods to the inventory routing problem, the augmented &#949;-constrained and the augmented Tchebycheff metric, to find the efficient Pareto frontier using a branch-and-cut method.For the multimodal freight transportation problems, we consider uncertainty in the origin nodes, apply probabilistic constraints, and also analyze the trade-off of the objective functions using the global criterion method and the augmented Tchebycheff metric.Computational experiments were conducted on instances adapted from the literature and others generated randomly, solving the bi-objective methods exactly.The analysis of the results indicates the approach's ability to balance economy and sustainability, where, on average, extreme solutions show a reduction of more than 50% in emissions and an increase of just over 30% in costs.Finally, the results of the solution methods applied to the two problems considering sustainability are presented and discussed.We detail a methodology for estimating CO 2 emissions, reflecting the complexity and the need to balance economic and ecological factors in logistic problems.</description>

      <title>Promoting Environmental Sustainability: The Role of Renewable Energy Systems and Environmental Taxes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app14167404</link>
      <description>Yugang He, Applied Sciences. 14(16)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401888867

                This study examines the effects of renewable energy consumption and environmental taxes on CO2 emissions in OECD countries from 1990 to 2022, employing the cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) approach. The findings reveal that both renewable energy consumption and environmental taxes significantly reduce CO2 emissions in both the short and the long term, emphasizing their crucial roles in climate change mitigation and sustainability promotion. Furthermore, this study identifies that industrialization and urbanization contribute to increased emissions, whereas foreign direct investment aids in emission reduction through the facilitation of green technology transfer. Economic growth is initially associated with higher emissions, but this trend reverses as economies mature and adopt sustainable practices. These results highlight the importance of continuous investment in renewable energy infrastructure and the implementation of robust environmental tax policies to achieve long-term sustainability goals. The integration of environmental considerations into economic and urban planning, along with leveraging foreign direct investment for technological advancements, is imperative for balancing economic growth with the necessity to reduce carbon emissions and effectively address climate change. This research provides a better understanding of the diverse factors influencing CO2 emissions and offers critical insights for policymakers.</description>

      <title>Scalable Low-Temperature CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electrolysis: Current Status and Outlook</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.4c00583</link>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) in membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) has brought e-chemical production one step closer to commercialization because of its advantages of minimized ohmic resistance and stackability. However, the current performance of reported eCO2R in MEAs is still far below the threshold for economic feasibility where low overall cell voltage (&lt;2 V) and extensive stability (&gt;5 years) are required. Furthermore, while the production cost of e-chemicals heavily relies on the carbon capture and product separation processes, these areas have received much less attention compared to CO2 electrolysis, itself. In this perspective, we examine the current status of eCO2R technologies from both academic and industrial points of view. We highlight the gap between current capabilities and commercialization standards and offer future research directions for eCO2R technologies with the hope of achieving industrially viable e-chemical production.</description>

      <title>The Effectiveness of the EU ETS Policy in Changing the Energy Mix in Selected European Countries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17174243</link>

                In the field of economic analysis, the study of the EU ETS policy has primarily focused on the impact of renewable energy consumption on economic growth, as well as the role of legal and fiscal instruments in the development of clean energy. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the EU ETS policy in altering the energy mix of selected European countries, providing both cognitive and applicational value. The evaluation of the effectiveness of this policy focused on the structure of the energy mix and the relationship between rising CO2 emission allowance prices and the decreasing share of coal in the energy mix. The goal was achieved through statistical analysis of secondary sources, primarily sourced from Bloomberg (2016&#8211;2024). The research findings indicated that changes in the structure of energy sources varied across the studied European countries, due to the adopted energy source utilization strategy, resource availability, and geopolitical situations. Additionally, different correlation values were noted between rising CO2 emission allowance prices and the expected reduction in fossil fuel use. Therefore, the EU ETS policy does not fulfill its assigned role&#8212;its implementation contributes to disparities in the economic situations of European economies and creates conditions for unequal competition.</description>

      <title>LaCoO3 is a promising catalyst for dry reforming of benzene used as a surrogate of biomass tar</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.55730/1300-0527.3685</link>
      <description>Ba&#351;ar &#199;a&#287;lar, Deniz &#220;ner, TURKISH JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY. 48(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401854464

                Tar build-up is one of the bottlenecks of biomass gasification process. Dry reforming of tar is an alternative solution if oxygen chemical potential on the catalyst surface is at sufficient levels. For this purpose, an oxygen donor perovskite, LaCoO3, was used as a catalyst for dry reforming of tar. To circumvent the complexity of the tar and its constituents, benzene molecule was chosen as a model compound. Dry reforming of benzene vapour on the LaCoO3 catalyst was investigated at temperatures of 600, 700, 800 &#176;C, at the CO2/C6H6 ratios of 3, 6, 12 and at space velocities of 14000 and 28000 h-1. The conventional Ni(15 wt.%)/Al2O3 catalyst was also used as a reference material to determine the relative activity of the LaCoO3 catalyst. Different characterization techniques, such as X-Ray Diffraction, N2 adsorption-desorption, Temperature-programmed reduction, and oxidation were used to determine physicochemical characteristics of catalysts. The findings demonstrate that the LaCoO3 catalyst has a higher CO2 conversion, H2 and CO yields and better stability than the Ni(15 wt.%)/&#947;-Al2O3 catalyst. The improvement in activity is attributed to the strong capacity of LaCoO3 for oxygen exchange. The transfer of lattice oxygen from the surface of the LaCoO3 catalyst facilitates the oxidation of carbon and other surface species and leads to higher conversion and yields.</description>

      <title>Environmental impact assessment and comparative analysis of hot stamping and cold stamping processes: A cradle-to-gate lifecycle assessment study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21741/9781644903254-29</link>
      <description>Marco Bucconi, Materials research proceedings. 44(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401881225

                Abstract. This manuscript presents the results of a cradle-to-gate lifecycle assessment (LCA) conducted on a component manufactured through two distinct process routes: Hot stamping of AA6082-T6 and cold stamping of AA5251-H22. The primary objective of this study is to provide a detailed understanding of the environmental impact associated with these processes and to conduct a comparative analysis of their environmental profiles. A comprehensive process map was developed for each manufacturing route, delineating all inputs and outputs at each step. Forming trials were executed during the LCA, capturing equipment energy consumption. When immediate data was unavailable from trials, the LCA model was supplemented with information from the Ecoinvent 3.6 database. The analysis demonstrates that the adoption of advanced near-net-shape manufacturing, specifically hot stamping, can significantly diminish the environmental impact compared to traditional cold stamping processes. Despite the additional energy requirements for heating in hot stamping, the overall environmental savings, supported by uncertainty analysis, are considerable. In the case of the examined demonstrator part, hot stamping showcased a noteworthy 35% reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions, equivalent to 6 kg CO2e per part. This reduction is primarily attributed to two key factors: the decreased material thickness achievable in hot stamping while preserving equivalent mechanical characteristics in the final part and the recycling of any material waste after forming. The results underscore the environmental advantages of embracing advanced manufacturing techniques, contributing valuable insights for environmentally conscious decision-making in the manufacturing industry.</description>

      <title>A Study on Management of Administrative Challenges and Market Strategies in the Implementation of Carbon Tax in Indonesia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.46799/adv.v2i7.270</link>
      <description>Trio Ardhimansyah, Muammar Khaddafi, Deleted Journal. 2(7)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401897653

                This research discusses administrative challenges and market strategies in implementing a carbon tax in Indonesia. The carbon tax was introduced through the 2021 Harmonization of Tax Regulations Law to control CO2 emissions from fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. Key challenges include administrative complexity, strong inter-agency coordination, effective monitoring systems, and consistent law enforcement. The global carbon market in 2023 shows great potential for economically efficient emissions reductions, but implementing this model requires adapting to Indonesia's socio-economic landscape. The research method used is a qualitative approach with case studies, combining data from policy documents, interviews with tax experts, and local carbon market analysis. The research results show that the implementation of a carbon tax is faced with several major challenges, including a lack of accurate data on emissions, an immature monitoring system, and resistance from certain industrial sectors. Effective market management strategies, such as the allocation of tax revenues to sustainable projects, are key to mitigating negative economic impacts and encouraging investment in green technologies. This research makes a significant contribution to the understanding of the complexity of carbon tax implementation in developing countries and its relevance in the global context for achieving climate change goals.</description>

      <title>Electronic Tunability of Ruthenium Formyl and Hydroxymethyl Intermediates Relevant to Sustainable CO-to-Methanol Conversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.organomet.4c00252</link>

                Metal formyl and hydroxymethyl complexes are implicated as key intermediates in the (photo)electrochemical reduction of carbon oxides (CO2 or CO) to liquid fuels, such as methanol. Formyl complexes, and to a lesser extent hydroxymethyl complexes, have been previously synthesized and characterized; nevertheless, the influence of electronic modifications to ligands supporting these reactive carbon fragments is not well understood. Herein, we report the synthesis of a family of ruthenium polypyridyl carbonyl complexes of the form [Ru(4,4&#8242;-R,R-bpy)(tpy)(CO)]2+ bearing different substituents on the bipyridyl (bpy) ligand (R = OMe, H, CF3). Treatment with NaBH4 as a chemical reductant results in the formation of the formyl and subsequently the hydroxymethyl and methyl complexes; each is characterized by comprehensive NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and isotopic labeling studies. An electron-donating modification (R = OMe) to the bpy ligand is shown to significantly increase the lifetime of the formyl intermediate and the yield of released methanol. We observe a clear linear dependence of thermodynamic parameters on bpy electronics; however, the stability of the formyl complex and the reactivity of the resulting hydroxymethyl complex do not depend linearly on ligand electronics. We anticipate that these results may be extended to future development of (photo)electrocatalytic systems for CO-to-methanol conversion.</description>

                Installations of telecommunications base stations necessary to address the surging demand for new services are traditionally powered by conventional energy sources, which results in massive electricity consumption and CO2 emissions as a portion. In this paper we assess the benefits of adopting renewable energy resources to make telecommunications network greener and cost-efficient, tacking &#8220;3E&#8221; combination-energy security, environmental sustainability, economic development. The study first reviews the seemingly insatiable demand for energy in telecommunications filtering its historical use against the inefficacy and environmental impact of typical fossil power. Followed by the advantages renewable energy offers in terms of lower GHG emissions, cost reduction and increased reliability / resilience. The possibility of powering BTSs by using renewable power sources such as solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, and hybrid systems is also considered. Case studies show some real-world projects and their success stories to highlight the benefits as well as draw out here best practices in implementation for those inclined. The paper also presents some future and novel trends that could improve the sustainability, efficiency of telecommunication infrastructure. This review provides an overview of the renewable energy assessment in LTE systems and underlines its importance to drive telecom sector transformation, developing sustainability strategies, and alleviating global energy scarcity issues. &#8203;</description>

      <title>Assessment of Properties of Green SCC with and without Novel Additive</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.55041/ijsrem37187</link>
      <description>IJSREM Journal, INTERANTIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT. 08(008)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401893700

                Concrete is the most widely used construction material in civil engineering industry because of its proved structural strength and stability when made properly. The concrete industry is constantly trying to evolve to make concrete more sustainable replacing a part of full cement with additives and Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs). Each tonne of cement production releases one tonne of CO2 into the atmosphere and hence to greenhouse effect and global warming. A cost effective, alternative and innovative materials called novel additive is taken up for present study to reduce the cement consumption per m3 of concrete/SCC without reduction in strength of required grade. In this project an effort is made replacing cement content of SCC partially with Fly Ash, Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) in combination of novel additive. The study focused at studying the properties of fresh SCC and hardened SCC. The design mix proportion of 1: 2.63: 1.86 with a W/B ratio of 0.36 is taken up and 4 different mixes with different combinations of varied percentage replacement materials with 2% by weight of cement of novel additive. The properties of green SCC showed that fresh properties get enhanced through usage of mineral admixtures including a novel additive and hence, the addition of mineral admixture improve the flowability or rheology of SCC mixes. The strength of SCC achieved is ranging from 32- 46 N/mm2 for a cementitious content of 400 kg/m3 , highest being with lowest cement content with novel additive.

      <title>Decision Support System for Sustainable Retrofitting of Existing Commercial Office Buildings</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.18535/ijsrm/v12i08.em20</link>
      <description>Calistus Bengold Anarene, Swapan Saha, Peter J. Davies, Dr MD Kamrul, International Journal of Scientific Research and Management (IJSRM). 12(08)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401828729

                With more than 60% of the inventory being over thirty years old, commercial office buildings represent a substantial global energy consumer. The Australian government has attempted to lower greenhouse gas emissions through legislation, but the implementation of these efforts has only resulted in annual reductions of 1-3%. It is essential to focus energy-efficient interventions on the stock of current commercial buildings if we are to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Energy performance, efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions can all be improved in commercial buildings by reducing energy consumption. According to Climate Works Australia and the IPCC, there is a 30% chance of avoiding current energy use while still reaping net economic benefits. To lessen global warming, the IPCC has also recommended that developed nations, like Australia, reduce emissions by 45% by 2030. Buildings with passive technologies can have better energy efficiency without sacrificing comfort. One of the main tactics for lowering energy consumption and carbon emissions in already-existing commercial buildings is energy retrofitting. "Providing a machine with a part, or a place with equipment which was not originally present when it was built" is what the Cambridge Dictionary defines as "retrofitting." However, in this context, it refers to any intervention activity that involves modernizing or repurposing the current structure to satisfy an appropriate requirement. Both cases deal with increasing a building's level of sustainability and energy efficiency through renovations. Multiple combinations of applicable energy consumption-reducing measures that can be applied to retrofit a building present a major challenge to decision-makers in energy retrofit. The evaluation of life cycle cost (LCC) and life cycle analysis (LCA) during retrofits present additional difficulties. LCC and LCA are not used in tandem; additionally, selecting the most appropriate retrofitting strategy or set of measures can occasionally be challenging due to the inclusion of unqualified sustainable technology in listings and selections. The current study intends to address the problems by creating a strong decision support system (RDSS) that integrates sustainable criteria, or triple bottom line TBLs (environmental, social, and economic benefits), in the energy retrofit decision-making process. This will lessen the difficulties encountered in making decisions that will lead to successful building appraisals. The predetermined objectives are meant to lead to the goal. Because of various technological alternatives, it may be vital to have a comparison to simplify sustainable technologies (STs) tools using SWOT/multiple criteria in TBL aspects. Providing an assessment method to merge LCA &amp; LCC to balance environmental and economic performances and determine the impact of the building life cycle on the energy retrofit decision process. Address the challenges decision-makers encounter in dealing with changes due to building markets and regulations since legislation and public expectation drive sustainable buildings. To develop and validate a holistic optimum strategic decision model to select the best retrofit alternatives for a particular building which maximizes the sustainability ranking of the building. Initial research focuses on conducting a life-cycle cost analysis of a commercial office car park building in Sydney, New South Wales. The evaluation includes assessing energy performance through retrofit measures to determine long-term benefits. By using life-cycle cost analysis, the study aims to enhance decision-making in energy assessment. To examine energy consumption intensity, lifecycle costing, CO2 emissions, and cost efficiency, data will be collected from non-green buildings and one building's envelope will be simulated using the Energy Plus tool. Experimental measurements will be compared to validate simulated models. The study includes a case study on a 12,000 square meter commercial office building used as a commercial parking facility. Retrofitting activities were initiated on three office rooms, focusing on HVAC, lighting, and equipment improvements, resulting in a 1.9-year payback period, 15% emissions reduction, 25% energy savings, and 23% cost savings. The subsequent phase involves utilizing various methods such as concept mapping, focus groups, interviews, Questionnaire surveys, and statistical analysis (SPSS) to develop a robust decision support system (RDSS) for sustainable energy retrofits. The overall goal is to establish a systematic decision support system to aid decision-makers and policymakers in improving energy efficiency in commercial office buildings by implementing passive technologies. The system will also recommend strategies to enhance financial outcomes through smart building operations and management implementations.</description>

(4) Interest is particularly growing in the Asia-Pacific area with its expanding population, urbanization, and rising disposable incomes which in turn drives the need for innovative green and sustainable chemical technologies that biocatalysis can provide [https://www.unescap.org/projects/gd]. This strong interest in new green technologies has caused a dramatic increase in fundamental research in biocatalysis, with large numbers of research groups from different disciplines entering the field. The breadth of research in biocatalysis in the Asia-Pacific area is showcased in this Virtual Special Issue, titled Biocatalysis in Asia and Pacific, which includes a snapshot of a collection of articles published in JACS Au in 2023/2024.Despite many successes in the general application of biocatalysis in industry, there remain many fundamental scientific challenges, some of which are addressed in this selection of papers. One particular challenge concerns the need for expensive cofactors such as nicotinamides which are for example needed for reduction and oxidation reactions. A perspective describes the very elegant solution of "biocatalytic hydrogen borrowing", which uses multistep sequences including dehydrogenation and hydrogenation in one pot by hydride shuffling between NAD(P)+ and NAD(P)H [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00026]. Another common challenge is active protein expression, and in a novel approach, unspecific peroxygenases have been successfully expressed using a superfolder-green-fluorescent protein in bacteria [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00129]. For multistep biocatalytic processes, cellular engineering guided by proteomic analysis can dramatically increase product titers, as shown for the production of &#945;-bisabolene in yeast [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00106].An area of great interest is the design of reactions and reaction sequences beyond those found in nature. Some successful approaches shown here explore substrate promiscuity for challenging CO2 fixation reactions [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00290] or atroposelective synthesis of aldehydes [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00814]. Alternatively, biocatalysis can be combined with chemical reactions in chemo-enzymatic strategies, including for example Au catalysis [DOIs: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00222, 10.1021/jacsau.3c00688]. Such biocatalytic processes are not only applicable to the synthesis of target molecules but also in bioremediation strategies as demonstrated by removal of the toxic metabolite deoxynivalenol in plants [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00696] and engineering of a metal reductase for the bioremediation of anthropogenic electronic wastes [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00297].In addition to small molecule substrates, biocatalysis is also very attractive for larger biomolecules, such as complex glycoproteins that make up a significant number of the leading biopharmaceutical products. Glycoengineering using biocatalysis provides a tool for improving the therapeutic profile of antibodies, and using a structure-based design approach, an endoglycosidase was engineered to provide a novel toolbox for conjugating glycans to specific glycoprotein sites [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00004]. Glycoengineering often requires sugar nucleotide cofactor regeneration systems, and one such example for UDP-Xylose has been designed as bifunctional chimeras to minimize the need for additional proteins and improved activity [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00288].Computational tools are making a great impact in biocatalysis, in particular in protein engineering, and it is interesting that several papers in this Virtual Special Issue make use of machine learning and modeling tools to find new and better activities: directed evolution and machine learning are used in combination to enhance the diastereoselectivity of a ketoreductase [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00284]. Molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanical calculations have been used to redesign a P450 monooxygenase [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.4c00075]. Computational enzyme redesign has been used to find mutants of a lyase with enhanced tolerance to denaturants for peptide C-terminal amidation [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00792]. Finally, density functional theory calculations and molecular dynamic simulations were used to identify and reduce energy barriers of key transition states to enhance C&#8211;N cleavage efficiency of an amino acid oxidase [DOI: 10.1021/jacsau.3c00672].It is striking how even a small collection of papers in biocatalysis from Asia and the Pacific showcases the engagement of a very diverse group of scientists in areas ranging from computational to synthetic chemistry, chemical biology, biochemistry, and synthetic biology to applications in engineering, cell biology, and medicine. Similarly diverse are the challenges addressed beyond the synthesis of bioactive compounds, driven by demands to solve societal problems in medicine with a more green and sustainable production of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical entities. There are also contributions from biocatalysis in directly solving environmental issues such as detoxification, removal of waste from the environment, and CO2 fixation. This Virtual Special Issue clearly shows that the topic of biocatalysis is very actively pursued at the highest international level using leading experimental and computational tools. Biocatalysis is very important to Asia and the Pacific, and the community is well placed to solve many of the challenges that lie ahead.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorsSabine L.

Biocatalysis is becoming an increasingly impactful method in contemporary synthetic chem. for target mol. synthesis. The selectivity imparted by enzymes has been leveraged to complete previously intractable chem. transformations and improve synthetic routes toward complex mols. However, the implementation of biocatalysis in mainstream org. chem. has been gradual to this point. This is partly due to a set of historical and technol. barriers that have prevented chemists from using biocatalysis as a synthetic tool with utility that parallels alternative modes of catalysis. In this Perspective, we discuss these barriers and how they have hindered the adoption of enzyme catalysts into synthetic strategies. We also summarize tools and resources that already enable org. chemists to use biocatalysts. Furthermore, we discuss ways to further lower the barriers for the adoption of biocatalysis by the broader synthetic org. chem. community through the dissemination of resources, demystifying biocatalytic reactions, and increasing collaboration across the field. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3sXhsVyksL%252FP&amp;md5=c75f4b0fa7f76b51151b2a63beb2b5a43France, S.

These materials encompass various categories and types, including graphene, (1) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), (2) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), (3) MXenes, (4) graphdiyne, (5) covalent organic frameworks (COFs), (6) and monolayer molecular crystals. (7) These materials can exhibit diverse properties as metals, semiconductors, superconductors, insulators, dielectrics, and magnets. Their unique electronic, optical, mechanical, and quantum properties make them suitable for a wide range of applications, from transistors and sensors to quantum information sciences and energy storage. With their highly tunable and versatile physical properties, these atomically thin materials could promise technological opportunities beyond the reach of existing materials.With a thickness measured by a single atom or a few atoms and lateral dimensions extending up to the meter scale, 2D materials feature an extreme aspect ratio of up to 109 or larger. This extreme aspect ratio necessitates highly anisotropic growth, with growth rates differing by millions or billions of times across different dimensions, posing a fundamentally new synthetic challenge. Achieving consistent single-atom thickness while expanding laterally to macroscopic scale requires fine-tuned control over the nucleation and growth process. Precision chemistry holds the key to the production of uniform 2D materials, (8) their heterostructures, (9) and superlattices, (10,11) which are central for consistent electronic and optical properties. Understanding the fundamental growth mechanisms is essential for the controlled synthesis of 2D materials with specific stacking orders, symmetry, and phase characteristics, fundamentally determining their properties. (12) By precisely controlling doping levels, edge termination, heterostructure formation, and intercalation of functional species, researchers can further tailor the electronic and chemical properties of 2D materials, enhancing their functionality for various applications. (13) Given the extreme surface-to-volume ratio of 2D materials, precision surface chemistry is also critical for manipulating and optimizing relevant physical properties, including surface functionalization, surface protection, charge density, and other exotic properties such chiral optical and spintronic properties. Proper surface modification may also enhance the stability and performance of 2D materials in various applications.Precision chemistry plays a central role in tailoring the atomic and molecular structures of 2D materials, thereby unlocking their full potential in various high-impact areas such as lower-power electronics, energy storage, catalysis, and sensing. Precise control over dimensions, chemical compositions, impurity doping, heterostructure interface, or surface modification makes it possible to finely tune the electronic properties of 2D materials, including bandgap engineering, carrier density, and mobility regulation, which are crucial for applications in transistors, sensors, and other electronic devices. 2D materials exhibit unique optical properties, such as layer-number tunable photoluminescence and strong light&#8211;matter interactions. (14,15) Precision control over their synthesis allows for the optimization of these properties for use in optoelectronic devices and photodetectors. At the atomic scale, quantum effects become significant. Precision chemistry allows for the control over quantum properties such as spin, (16) valley polarization, (17) charge correlation, (18) and single photon emission, (19) which are important for emerging quantum technologies. (20) Additionally, 2D materials are also promising candidates for energy conversion and storage applications due to their high surface area and unique electrochemical properties. A precise control of their synthesis, surface modification, heteroatom doping, and assembly in higher-order superstructures is critical for capturing the merits of 2D materials in supercapacitors, batteries, fuel cells, or green hydrogen production.
