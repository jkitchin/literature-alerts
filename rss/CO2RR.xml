                Catalysts involving post&#8208;transition metals have shown almost invincible performance on generating formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Conversely, Cu without post&#8208;transition metals have struggled to achieve comparable activity. In this study, a sulfur (S)&#8208;doped&#8208;copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalyst is developed, exhibiting excellent performance in formate generation with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 92% and a partial current density of 321 mA cm&#8208;2. Ex&#8208;situ structural elucidations reveal the presence of abundant grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8208;S bonds from the covellite phase during CO2RR. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that S&#8208;S bonds can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates, further improving the activity of the formate pathway. This work is significant in modifying a low&#8208;cost catalyst (Cu) with a non&#8208;metallic substance (S) to achieve comparable performance to mainstream catalysts for formate generation in industrial grade.</description>

                Abstract To prevent global warming, various technologies are being developed to suppress carbon dioxide emissions. Nanobubbles are useful in various industrial fields. Carbon dioxide capture technology was studied using the property of activating the reaction of nanobubbles. In this study, carbon dioxide capture was attempted using nanobubble generation tubes based on the friction principle. The world has paid attention to carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) to inhibit and reduce carbon dioxide emissions, which are known as the main cause of global warming. The problem is that the new process that utilizes carbon dioxide must consume less energy and resources than existing alternative processes. To address this problem, research was conducted on the possibility of dissolving carbon dioxide in large quantities at low power consumption using a nanobubble generation system and real-time chemical reactions in this study. In addition, a mass dissolution system was constructed, and real-time neutralization was verified through the reactions of nanobubble carbon dioxide with ammonia water (NH 4 OH) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2 ) solution.</description>

                Carbon capture and conversion are becoming increasingly important as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise and their adverse effects become increasingly evident. CO2 conversion/utilization-related research has gained renewed interest on a variety of platforms, including thermal, solar, biological, photochemical, and electrochemical conversions. Electrochemical routes, using suitable catalysts, are potentially suitable for commercial purposes owing to ease of integration with solvent-based carbon capture processes. This paper summarizes and evaluates the studies conducted within the past decade regarding the feasibility of carbon-based supports utilized in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. CO2 conversion has been reviewed in a number of reports, focusing on specific sections, such as metallic/bimetallic catalysts, CO2 solubility, and the fabrication of electrodes and electrochemical cells. The number of publications addressing various carbon-based electrocatalysts is increasing, but these materials have not yet been reviewed. Herein, we are focused on three types of electrocatalyst materials: metals, metal-oxides, non-oxides, and combinations thereof with carbon. The scope of this study includes the following: i) carbon-based materials and how they are characterized by distinctive properties, ii) electrocatalytic CO2 conversion techniques, and iii) research cases for carbon allotrope-supported composites used in CO2 reduction. The advancement in analytical tools that provide insight into liquid-phase reactions will benefit the development of catalysts and electrodes that will be effective in converting CO2 into the desired products. Such developments will also be applicable to other systems involving liquid electrolytes or solvents for performing reactions on catalyst surfaces.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction by borophene supported bimetallic catalysts</title>

                Bimetal atom catalysts (BACs) hold significant potential for various applications as a result of the synergistic interaction between adjacent metal atoms. This interaction leads to improved catalytic performance, while simultaneously maintaining high atomic efficiency and exceptional selectivity, similar to single atom catalysts (SACs). Bimetallic site catalysts (M2&#946;12) supported by &#946;12-borophene were developed as catalysts for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The research on density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that M2&#946;12 exhibits exceptional stability, conductivity, and catalytic activity. Investigating the most efficient reaction pathway for CO2RR by analyzing the Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) during potential determining steps (PDS) and choosing a catalyst with outstanding catalytic performance for CO2RR. The overpotential required for Fe2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 to generate CO is merely 0.05 V. This implies that the conversion of CO2 to CO can be accomplished with minimal additional voltage. The overpotential values for Cu2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 during the formation of HCOOH were merely 0.001 and 0.07 V, respectively. Furthermore, the Rh2&#946;12 catalyst exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 0.51 V for CH3OH and 0.65 V for CH4. The Fe2&#946;12 produces C2H4 through the *CO-*CO pathway, while Ag2&#946;12 generates CH3CH2OH via the *CO-*CHO coupling pathway, with remarkably low overpotentials of 0.84 and 0.60 V, respectively. The study provides valuable insights for the systematic design and screening of electrocatalysts for CO2RR that exhibit exceptional catalytic performance and selectivity.</description>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction is considered a promising solution to mitigate the increasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Despite the promising potential of this process, highly active catalysts are needed to enable its efficient operation. Mixed metal oxide (MMO) materials can promote the formation of a dynamic interface between a metal and its oxidized form under applied potential, resulting in a unique interaction with the reaction intermediates. We synthesized a Pd&#8211;Mo MMO with controlled size and composition and examined the effect of these properties on CO2 electroreduction. Electron microscopy images confirmed the homogeneous distribution of the synthesized Pd7Mo1 on a ZIF-8-derived porous carbon support, with sizes of &#8764;1.3 and 4.5 nm for the samples annealed at 200 and 400 &#176;C, respectively. As shown by density functional theory calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, adding 12.5 % Mo altered the electronic structure of Pd, enhancing CO desorption, and reducing the potential needed for CO production by up to &#8764;0.2 V, corresponding to a &#8764;40 % higher partial CO current density compared to pure Pd. This work demonstrates a facile MMO synthesis enabling particle size and composition control, which will facilitate the development of highly active MMO-derived nanoalloy materials for CO2 electroreduction.</description>

                Abstract Single&#8208;atom catalysts possess great potential for applications in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions. Recently, the fast and low&#8208;cost preparation of highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts remains a challenge. Herein, a high&#8208;density current generated by pulsed discharge is employed for the formation of graphene aerogel anchored Cu single atom catalysts perfectly. The Cu atoms decomposed by Cu(NO 3 ) 2 &#8226;xH 2 O are fixed on graphene under the local transient high temperature and intense electromagnetic field. The activity and selectivity of formic acid are correlated with the coordinatively unsaturated Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 moieties, reaching an optimal Faradaic efficiency (93.7%) at &#8722;0.9 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In situ characterizations reveal that the asymmetric Cu&#9472;N/O structure in a pinched state displays better catalytic activity in CO 2 RR. Density functional theory results indicate that the Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 sites regulate the adsorption configuration of intermediates and lower the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of * OCHO species, thereby promoting CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion.</description>

                Abstract Carbon dioxide conversion into valuable products using photocatalysis and electrocatalysis is an effective approach to mitigate global environmental issues and the energy shortages. Among the materials utilized for catalytic reduction of CO 2 , Cu-based materials are highly advantageous owing to their widespread availability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, Cu-based materials demonstrate interesting abilities in the adsorption and activation of carbon dioxide, allowing the formation of C 2+ compounds through C&#8211;C coupling process. Herein, the basic principles of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions (PCO 2 RR) and electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (ECO 2 RR) and the pathways for the generation C 2+ products are introduced. This review categorizes Cu-based materials into different groups including Cu metal, Cu oxides, Cu alloys, and Cu SACs, Cu heterojunctions based on their catalytic applications. The relationship between the Cu surfaces and their efficiency in both PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR is emphasized. Through a review of recent studies on PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR using Cu-based catalysts, the focus is on understanding the underlying reasons for the enhanced selectivity toward C 2+ products. Finally, the opportunities and challenges associated with Cu-based materials in the CO 2 catalytic reduction applications are presented, along with research directions that can guide for the design of highly active and selective Cu-based materials for CO 2 reduction processes in the future.</description>

      <title>Carbon dioxide reduction utilizing a bismuth halide perovskite as immobilized photocatalyst in a 3D printed microreactor</title>

                Abstract The rising concerns about CO 2 levels in the atmosphere and energy dependency on non-renewable sources, such as fossil fuels, could find an integral solution in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. The present work explores two alternatives to the main hindering factors for this reaction, i.e., the reactor configuration and the photocatalyst utilized. A microreactor was designed and 3D printed, providing a cheap and versatile reaction platform. Three bismuth halide perovskites, Cs 3 Bi 2 Cl 9 , Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 , and Cs 4 MnBi 2 Cl 12 , were synthesized and characterized by their band gaps (E g ); Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 presented the lowest E g and was therefore chosen for further evaluation as potential CO 2 -reduction photocatalyst. Aqueous-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was achieved using this perovskite in the microreactor, obtaining CO as a reduction product with maximal production rates of 737 &#956;mol g cat -1 h -1 . The reaction system was evaluated under different flow rates and light intensities. A balance between space-time and reactant feed was found to define the behavior of CO concentration and production in the microreactor. For the light intensity, it was observed that as it increased, both CO production and concentration increased due to generating more electron-hole pairs, favoring the photocatalytic reaction. With these results, Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 perovskite immobilized in the designed microreactor demonstrates having great potential as an effective CO 2 photocatalytic reduction system.&amp;amp;#xD;</description>

                Cu2O shows great potential as a catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR). However, the mechanism behind the formation of different final products from Cu2O nanostructures remains a challenge. In this study, we combine theoretical and experimental approaches to demonstrate that the full-exposed Cu sites in Cu2O (1 0 0) microcubes contribute to superior C2H4 selectivity compared to other microstructures such as Cu2O (1 1 1), (1 1 0), and (3 1 1) facets. Density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations reveal that the stronger orbital splitting between Cu 3d and O 2p orbital of Cu2O (1 0 0) facet facilitates the formation of neighboring and low valence state Cu active site, thereby enhancing *CO adsorption and C2H4 formation. These DFT results are supported by the synthesis of four kinds of Cu2O microparticles (MPs) with different exposed facets, where cubic-Cu2O with the (1 0 0) facet exhibits the highest Faradaic efficiency (61.3 %). This study has significant implications for the structural design and mechanism analysis of innovative catalysts used in ECO2RR.</description>

                Methanogens are essential players in the global carbon cycle. Methanosarcinales possess one of the most diverse metabolic repertoires for methanogenesis, but they have never been observed to utilize formate as a substrate. We successfully reprogrammed the primary metabolism of Methanosarcina acetivorans by introducing an exogenous formate dehydrogenase derived from a closely related species. The engineered strains acquired the capacity to harness energy from formate-dependent methanogenesis pathways, including formate-dependent methyl reduction and formate-dependent carbon dioxide reduction. The ability of M. acetivorans to thrive on formate suggests the existence of essential accessory machinery and metabolic redundancy for generating reduced ferredoxins from F420H2. This remarkable plasticity in energy metabolism raises the possibility that an ancestral lineage of Methanosarcinales may have possessed the capacity to utilize formate. By combining this genetically modified strain with a disruption in methyl disproportionation, we have created a novel tool for investigating and manipulating the components of the F420 reduction and methanogenesis pathways independently.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR) is gaining momentum as an effective process to capture and convert CO 2 into valuable chemicals and fuels, as well as to contribute reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes) are increasingly attracting attention as CO 2 RR electrocatalysts due to their enhanced chemical activity and selectivity, overcoming limitations of traditional metal CO 2 RR electrocatalysts, and likely breaking the scaling relations of reaction intermediates toward the desired product. The present concept reviews the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the computational description of CO 2 RR on MXenes, going from CO 2 activation on pristine models to different surface terminations, and discuss possible ways to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity, including doping, defects, supported single metal atoms, solvent effects, and electric field effects, while putting in the spotlight prospects by including kinetic aspects.</description>

      <description>Afdhal Yuda, Parisa Ebrahimi, Josephine Selvaraj, Anand Kumar, Vaidyanathan Subramanian, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 57(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390721078

                Carbon capture and conversion are becoming increasingly important as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise and their adverse effects become increasingly evident. CO2 conversion/utilization-related research has gained renewed interest on a variety of platforms, including thermal, solar, biological, photochemical, and electrochemical conversions. Electrochemical routes, using suitable catalysts, are potentially suitable for commercial purposes owing to ease of integration with solvent-based carbon capture processes. This paper summarizes and evaluates the studies conducted within the past decade regarding the feasibility of carbon-based supports utilized in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. CO2 conversion has been reviewed in a number of reports, focusing on specific sections, such as metallic/bimetallic catalysts, CO2 solubility, and the fabrication of electrodes and electrochemical cells. The number of publications addressing various carbon-based electrocatalysts is increasing, but these materials have not yet been reviewed. Herein, we are focused on three types of electrocatalyst materials: metals, metal-oxides, non-oxides, and combinations thereof with carbon. The scope of this study includes the following: i) carbon-based materials and how they are characterized by distinctive properties, ii) electrocatalytic CO2 conversion techniques, and iii) research cases for carbon allotrope-supported composites used in CO2 reduction. The advancement in analytical tools that provide insight into liquid-phase reactions will benefit the development of catalysts and electrodes that will be effective in converting CO2 into the desired products. Such developments will also be applicable to other systems involving liquid electrolytes or solvents for performing reactions on catalyst surfaces.</description>

      <title>ATR&#8211;SEIRAS Method to Measure Interfacial pH during Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction on Cu</title>

                This study reports the accuracy and applications of an attenuated total reflectance&#8211;surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8211;SEIRAS) technique to indirectly measure the interfacial pH of the electrolyte using the ratio of phosphate species within 10 nm of the electrocatalyst surface. This technique can be used in situ to study aqueous electrochemical reactions with a calibration range from pH 1&#8211;13, time resolution down to 4 s, and an average 95% confidence interval of 14% that varies depending on the pH region (acidic, neutral, or basic). The method is applied in this study to electrochemical nitrate reduction at a copper cathode to demonstrate its capabilities, but is broadly applicable to any aqueous electrochemical reaction (such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, or oxygen evolution) and the electrocatalyst may be any SEIRAS-active thin film (e.g., silver, gold, or copper). The time-resolved results show a dramatic increase in the interfacial pH from pH 2&#8211;7 in the first minute of operation during both constant current and pulsed current experiments where the bulk pH is unchanged. Attempts to control the pH polarization at the surface by altering the electrochemical operating conditions&#8212;lowering the current or increasing the pulse frequency&#8212;showed no significant change, demonstrating the challenge of controlling the interfacial pH.</description>

      <title>Regulating CHO* intermediate pathway towards the significant acceleration of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 through rGO-coated ultrafine Pd nanoparticles</title>

                Tailoring catalytic reaction pathways by using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to tune the electron-hole separation channels in the active sites of noble metals for achieving ideal yield and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction of hydrocarbon fuels remains a challenge. Herein, ternary catalyst of rGO-coated SnO2-supported noble metal Pd nanoparticles (Pd4/SnO2@rGO) has been prepared by coassembly between negatively charged graphene oxide and positively charged Pd nanoparticles. By coating with ultrathin rGO, the selectivity can be shifted from CO (44.69 % for Pd4/SnO2) toward CH4 as the prevalent species, in which the Pd nanoparticles acted as catalytic sites and electron capture sites. The rGO coating reduced the recombination of the photogenerated carriers as well as optimized the band gap and reduction potential of the catalyst. The in situ spectroscopic tests and density functional theory calculations revealed that CO2 adsorbed on Pd nanoparticles selectively formed dominant low-energy CHO* intermediates because of the generation of HCOOH* intermediates, thus providing a unique reaction pathway for the reduction of CO2 to CH4. Therefore, under sunlight irradiation, the CH4 selectivity of the catalyst is enhanced to 94.1 % with a production rate of up to 77.8 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1. This work demonstrated the prospect to tune the electronic structure of Pd using rGO, which provided a strategy for enhancing the carbon dioxide reduction reaction and selectively obtaining CH4 products in photocatalytic systems.</description>

                Abstract Single&#8208;atom catalysts possess great potential for applications in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions. Recently, the fast and low&#8208;cost preparation of highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts remains a challenge. Herein, a high&#8208;density current generated by pulsed discharge is employed for the formation of graphene aerogel anchored Cu single atom catalysts perfectly. The Cu atoms decomposed by Cu(NO 3 ) 2 &#8226;xH 2 O are fixed on graphene under the local transient high temperature and intense electromagnetic field. The activity and selectivity of formic acid are correlated with the coordinatively unsaturated Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 moieties, reaching an optimal Faradaic efficiency (93.7%) at &#8722;0.9 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In situ characterizations reveal that the asymmetric Cu&#9472;N/O structure in a pinched state displays better catalytic activity in CO 2 RR. Density functional theory results indicate that the Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 sites regulate the adsorption configuration of intermediates and lower the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of * OCHO species, thereby promoting CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion.</description>

      <title>Site Selection Evaluation of Co2 Storage in Saline Aquifers of Zhuyi Depression, the Pearl River Mouth Basin</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4691481</link>

                CO2 geological storage is the primary means of achieving large-scale, low-cost carbon dioxide reduction. Compared with onshore basins, sequestration in offshore basins has the advantages of larger storage volume and less impact on people and the environment. At the same time, there are also challenges such as high cost and technical difficulty for sequestration. At present, there are many researches on the selection and suitability evaluation of CCS in China, and there are also very successful demonstration applications, while the research on CO2 geological storage in sea areas is relatively few. Taking Zhuyi Depression of Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South China Sea as an example in this paper, with the goal of meeting the storage capacity of one million tons per year. Making statistics on the factors affecting the suitability of CO2 storage of oil and gas-bearing structures in the depression from three aspects: geological characteristics, storage economy and storage safety, and constructs a screening index system of CO2 geological storage field, which includes 3 levels and 18 evaluation factors. The index weight of each evaluation factor is calculated by AHP. The suitability of CO2 sealing of selected oil and gas-bearing structures is quantitatively evaluated by multi-source information overlap analysis. The results show that the Xijiang 23 and other oil-bearing structures in the west of Huizhou Sag have priority as the storage field. The results of this study can provide reference for the implementation and management decision of CO2 saline aquifers storage in this area.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction by borophene supported bimetallic catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.01.051</link>
      <description>Meiling Liu, Jayaraman Balamurugan, Tongxiang Liang, Chao Liu, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390766525

                Bimetal atom catalysts (BACs) hold significant potential for various applications as a result of the synergistic interaction between adjacent metal atoms. This interaction leads to improved catalytic performance, while simultaneously maintaining high atomic efficiency and exceptional selectivity, similar to single atom catalysts (SACs). Bimetallic site catalysts (M2&#946;12) supported by &#946;12-borophene were developed as catalysts for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The research on density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that M2&#946;12 exhibits exceptional stability, conductivity, and catalytic activity. Investigating the most efficient reaction pathway for CO2RR by analyzing the Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) during potential determining steps (PDS) and choosing a catalyst with outstanding catalytic performance for CO2RR. The overpotential required for Fe2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 to generate CO is merely 0.05 V. This implies that the conversion of CO2 to CO can be accomplished with minimal additional voltage. The overpotential values for Cu2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 during the formation of HCOOH were merely 0.001 and 0.07 V, respectively. Furthermore, the Rh2&#946;12 catalyst exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 0.51 V for CH3OH and 0.65 V for CH4. The Fe2&#946;12 produces C2H4 through the *CO-*CO pathway, while Ag2&#946;12 generates CH3CH2OH via the *CO-*CHO coupling pathway, with remarkably low overpotentials of 0.84 and 0.60 V, respectively. The study provides valuable insights for the systematic design and screening of electrocatalysts for CO2RR that exhibit exceptional catalytic performance and selectivity.</description>

      <title>CARBON TAX AND ITS EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY, TAXES AND ENVIRONMENT</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.56301/awl.v6i1.1013</link>
      <description>M.E. Retno Kadarukmi, Awang Long Law Review. 6(1)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4390652284

                This research discusses theoretically the relationship between carbon tax with economy, tax and environment. This research is a legal research with analytical descriptive nature, namely research that analyzes secondary data on issues related to carbon taxes as an instrument for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. According to secondary data, this research is aimed at discovering aspects of carbon tax design, collection of carbon taxes, and state management of carbon tax revenues. Carbon taxes are an effective and efficient instrument to support the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. To be implemented, a carbon tax must be feasible. Eligibility requires public acceptance. On the other hand, a carbon tax can create a lot of controversy. The main argument against carbon taxes is that carbon taxes do not always guarantee emission reductions. In addition, there are also concerns over the unintended effects of competitiveness, carbon leakage, and fears of unintended distributional impacts, which could be barriers to implementation.</description>

                China&#8217;s transition to a green, low-carbon economy is among the most essential elements needed to achieve the climate goals set down in the Paris Agreement. China has pledged it &#8220;will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060&#8221;.1 Given the currently high emissions level in China and an economic structure with significant share of industrial sector and fossil fuel consumption, it remains a formidable challenge to realize such steep emission reduction for the 30-60 goals, as we call them in this paper.</description>

      <title>Mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; Benefits from Superelevated CO2 While Adapting to Far-red Light Over Time</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21273/hortsci17522-23</link>
      <description>Emily J. Kennebeck, Qingguo Meng, Hortscience. 59(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390628599

                Compared with the ambient Earth carbon dioxide concentration (&#8776;415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), the International Space Station has superelevated carbon dioxide (&#8776;2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), which can be a stressor to certain crops. Far-red light can drive plant photosynthesis and increase extension growth and biomass. However, the effects of far-red light under superelevated carbon dioxide are unclear. We grew hydroponic mustard ( Brassica carinata ) &#8216;Amara&#8217; seedlings in four growth chambers using a randomized complete block design with two carbon dioxide concentrations (415 and 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), two lighting treatments, and two blocks at temperature and relative humidity set points of 22 &#176;C and 40%, respectively. Each growth chamber had two lighting treatments at the same total photon flux density of 200 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 . Under the same blue and green light at 50 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 each, plants received either red light at 100 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 or red + far-red light at 50 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 each. At day 15 after planting, far-red light did not influence shoot fresh or dry mass at 415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide, but decreased both parameters by 22% to 23% at 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration increased shoot fresh and dry mass 27% to 49%, regardless of the lighting treatment. Far-red light decreased leaf area by 16% at 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide, but had no effect at 415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration increased leaf area by 21% to 33%, regardless of far-red light. Regardless of the carbon dioxide concentration, far-red light promoted stem elongation and decreased chlorophyll concentrations by 39% to 42%. These responses indicate far-red light elicited a crop-specific shade avoidance response in mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217;, increasing extension growth but decreasing leaf area, thereby reducing light interception and biomass. In addition, carbon dioxide enrichment up to 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 increased the biomass of mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; but decreased the biomass of other crops, indicating crop-specific tolerance to superelevated carbon dioxide. In conclusion, mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; seedlings benefit from superelevated carbon dioxide, but exhibit growth reduction under far-red light under superelevated carbon dioxide.</description>

      <title>Influence of tillage methods on carbon dioxide emissions in spring wheat crops</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/20248206006</link>
      <description>Evgeniy Demin, Stanislav Miller, Kirill Likhanov, BIO web of conferences. 82(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390539980

                The agriculture intensification is associated with an increase in anthropogenic load on arable soils. Tillage leads to disruption of the natural process of soil formation in connection with which the soil biota activity changes and the carbon cycle is disrupted. The purpose of the study is to establish the effects of the tillage method on the carbon dioxide emission in spring wheat crops. The emission of carbon dioxide during the growing season of spring wheat varies significantly depending on the soil processing method and temperature. At the beginning of spring wheat development, the daily emission of carbon dioxide during the dump and subsurface tillage method does not exceed 36.0 and 36.2 CO 2 kg/ha using zero technology provides a reduction in production CO 2 production to 27.8 kg/ha*day. With an increase in soil temperature by July 24, the daily emission increases on a dump and subsurface background to 105.5 and 106.0 CO 2 kg/ha*day, on a zero background to 95.4 CO 2 kg/ha*day. In the future, it decreases. The total carbon losses during the dump and subsurface tillage methods are 2829 and 2793 kg/ha, the use of zero tillage technology reduces carbon losses in grain agrocenosis by 18%.</description>

      <title>Solar Water Heating: Comprehensive Review, Critical Analysis and Case Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.52843/cassyni.z0lx6v</link>
      <description>Amal Herez, No host. None(None)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4390616016

                The increasing global demand for renewable energy sources underscores the significance of Solar Water Heating Systems (SWHS), emphasizing the need for thorough research and analysis in this domain. SWHS play a pivotal role in addressing energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, making it imperative to conduct in-depth studies on their utilization. Hence, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of SWHS. It starts by explaining the principles behind these systems, including their components and classification. Moreover, this review consolidates various studies that have been conducted on SWHS to highlight both their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, a case study is conducted in which it takes into consideration important economic and environmental factors. In particular, it focuses on several scenarios present in Lebanon such as family homes, schools, restaurants hotels and gyms to estimate potential cost savings achieved through implementing SWHS as opposed to relying solely on electric heaters. Furthermore, this investigation also examines the corresponding payback period associated with adopting SWHS along with assessing the significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions possible if these systems were widely implemented. The findings of the study demonstrate that there is a direct correlation between the extent to which SWHS are utilized and both the payback period and reduction in CO2 emissions. It was observed that when SWHS are used more frequently, with a high percentage of time (Pr=0.9), significant advantages can be achieved. For instance, for different types of establishments such as family homes, schools, restaurants, hotels, and gyms, it was estimated that average payback periods would be 14.2 years, 4.6 years, 9.2 years, 4.4 years, and 5.3 years, respectively. These results indicate that adopting a greater dependency on SWHSs not only leads to quicker cost recovery but also significantly contributes towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The analysis reveals that the yearly decrease in carbon dioxide emissions per individual is 0.16 t within a household, 0.016 t per student in an educational institution, 0.04 t per customer within a dining establishment, 0.37 t for each occupied bed in a hotel accommodation, and 0.11 t per individual at a gym. This paper serves as guidelines to SWH community. Additionally, it adds a practical insights into economic and environmental issues relevant to both Lebanon and countries with similar climates.</description>

                The coal-based energy consumption structure has led to high coal consumption and carbon emissions in China's iron and steel industry, and the task of coal saving and carbon reduction in the steel industry is difficult and urgent. The economic viability of various coal-saving and emission-reduction technologies, the extent of their coal-saving and emission-reduction potential, and the guidance on the adoption of advanced technologies are crucial issues that need to be addressed in the Chinese steel industry. This article employs the Energy-Production (E-P) analysis method and the Conservation Supply Curve (CSC) model incorporating coal consumption ratio coefficients to systematically analyze coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the overall iron and steel industry and its sub-processes under different scenarios. It calculates the coal-saving emission reduction costs of 32 technologies, evaluates them comprehensively based on their coal-saving and emission-reduction potentials and cost-effectiveness, and categorizes them accordingly. According to the cost of coal saving and emission reduction as the demarcation point, a total of 19 technologies are cost-effective; according to the coal-saving emission reduction potential and cost division, 32 technologies are divided into 6 categories, among which 6 technologies such as sintering waste heat recovery technology can be used as key technologies for popularization and application. Seven technologies, such as efficient preheating technology of ladle, have high cost and low potential, which can be gradually eliminated or improved and upgraded. After the comprehensive promotion of the 32 technologies, the maximum coal saving potential is about 3.453 billion GJ, the CO2 emission reduction potential is 395 million tons, the total coal consumption of the steel industry can be reduced to about 13.904 billion GJ, and the carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced to 1.179 billion tons.</description>

                The development of floating photovoltaic systems in Romania can help to the share of more than 30.7 % of the total energy produced from renewable energy sources set for the year 2030. Floating photovoltaic plants ensure the achievement of overall energy targets without affecting biodiversity and/or agricultural crops. This study evaluates the insolation and the possibility of installing this technology on Lake F&#259;c&#259;u, Romania, to benefit from the generation of electricity but also better water quality and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$. The obtained results are promising as Floating photovoltaic plants covering around 0.22 % of the lake surface, provide 26.76 $M W h /$ year and the estimated reduction of CO &lt;inf xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt; emission is 7.52 $\mathbf{t C O}_{2 \mathrm{eq}} /$ year.</description>

                Abstract Carbon dioxide conversion into valuable products using photocatalysis and electrocatalysis is an effective approach to mitigate global environmental issues and the energy shortages. Among the materials utilized for catalytic reduction of CO 2 , Cu-based materials are highly advantageous owing to their widespread availability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, Cu-based materials demonstrate interesting abilities in the adsorption and activation of carbon dioxide, allowing the formation of C 2+ compounds through C&#8211;C coupling process. Herein, the basic principles of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions (PCO 2 RR) and electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (ECO 2 RR) and the pathways for the generation C 2+ products are introduced. This review categorizes Cu-based materials into different groups including Cu metal, Cu oxides, Cu alloys, and Cu SACs, Cu heterojunctions based on their catalytic applications. The relationship between the Cu surfaces and their efficiency in both PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR is emphasized. Through a review of recent studies on PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR using Cu-based catalysts, the focus is on understanding the underlying reasons for the enhanced selectivity toward C 2+ products. Finally, the opportunities and challenges associated with Cu-based materials in the CO 2 catalytic reduction applications are presented, along with research directions that can guide for the design of highly active and selective Cu-based materials for CO 2 reduction processes in the future.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Potential Carbon Dioxide Utilization Pathways in Uzbekistan</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/asec2023-15503</link>

                Reaching net-zero emissions by the middle of this century requires the implementation of massive carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction strategies along with the reduction of other greenhouse gases on both global and country scales. Thus, carbon capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU) is a promising technology in combination with renewable energy transition. Currently, CO2 utilization has attracted much attention from the scientific community worldwide, since it can improve the economic viability of CCSU deployment by creating a market for the recovered CO2 stream. In this study, a brief assessment and comparison of potential CO2 utilization pathways in Uzbekistan, including CO2-to-chemical/fuel conversion, CO2 bio-fixation/mineralization, and the direct use of CO2, such as for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery (EHR), are conducted considering the CO2 stationary sources and site-specific conditions of the country. In addition, possible challenges and opportunities for large-scale CO2 utilization routes are also discussed. According to this assessment, there is great potential for the direct use of CO2 as a process-boosting agent for EHR in more than 22 major natural gas, crude oil, and coal reservoirs. Moreover, methanol and urea production processes can also create huge market demand for recovered CO2 as long as the conventional CO2 production processes are replaced by sustainable ones.</description>

      <title>Economic and emissions analysis of behind-the-meter energy storage with rooftop solar: a case study for Indian residential consumers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1049/icp.2023.3106</link>

                The global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels continue to rise, driven by rising energy use. Rooftop photovoltaic (RTPV) systems are an effective way to reduce emissions and, consequently, the carbon footprint for residential consumers. The use of behind-the-meter (BTM) energy storage with RTPV is a flexible and dependable method for generating electricity as it provides power to the customer even if there is an outage from the utility grid. It also reduces reliance on the utility through savings in the electricity bill and reducing CO2 emissions. In this paper, we analyse the economics and emissions along with the sizing of BTM battery storage co-located with RTPV for residential customers in India. Based on the power flow interactions between RTPV, grid, and battery storage, a techno-economic framework is built to compute the system&amp;apos;s life cycle costing. The life cycle cost of energy for BTM battery storage with RTPV to meet a 14-kWh energy demand is INR 11/kWh. We observe a 75% decrease in utility costs and a 58% reduction in CO2 emissions for the same system. The findings of this study can help policymakers, utilities, and homeowners make informed decisions regarding the adoption and integration of energy storage systems with residential solar PV installations.</description>

                Abstract Carbon budgets are quantifications of the total amount of carbon dioxide that can ever be emitted while keeping global warming below specific temperature limits. However, estimates of these budgets for limiting warming to 1.5 &#176;C and well-below 2 &#176;C include assumptions about how much warming can be expected from non-CO 2 emissions. Here, we uncover the non-CO 2 emissions assumptions that underlie the latest remaining carbon budget estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and quantify the implication of the world pursuing alternative higher or lower emissions. We consider contributions of methane, nitrous oxide, fluorinated gases, and aerosols and show how pursuing inadequate methane emission reductions causes remaining carbon budgets compatible with the Paris Agreement temperature limits to be exhausted today, effectively putting achievement of the Paris Agreement out of reach.</description>

                Reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the aerobic biorefinery system is becoming a crucial effort for achieving carbon-economic biosynthesis of biomaterials and chemicals. Poly-2-hydrobutanedioic acid (P2HBD), a long-carbon chain polyester produced by the fungus Aureobasidium pullulans, has garnered significant attention in the biomaterials and chemical industries. In this study, we designed a CO2 emission reduction system using nonfermentable substrates to enable efficient biosynthesis of P2HBD. Based on the genome-scale model iZX637 of A. pullulans, glycerol and ethanol were stimulated to show the potential advantages over glucose in terms of reduced CO2 emission. Additionally, we employed an NADH/NAD+ fluorescent probe called SoNar to dynamically monitor the reductive power ratio during CO2 emission. Subsequently, glycerol metabolism and rTCA carbon fixation pathway were engineered, while implementing a modular assembly strategy to achieve balanced integration between these two modules through precise promoter engineering regulation. The optimal strain ZX-LM03 showed the advantages of less carbon emission with glycerol and ethanol as the co-substrates, and achieved the higher P2HBD titer and yield of 15.07 &#177; 0.18 g/L and 0.54 &#177; 0.01 g/g, with the lower carbon emission of 31.08% compared to glucose in the 5 L fermenter. In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into achieving carbon neutrality using renewable substrates for reducing carbon emission in aerobic fermentation systems.</description>

                Abstract The rising concerns about CO 2 levels in the atmosphere and energy dependency on non-renewable sources, such as fossil fuels, could find an integral solution in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. The present work explores two alternatives to the main hindering factors for this reaction, i.e., the reactor configuration and the photocatalyst utilized. A microreactor was designed and 3D printed, providing a cheap and versatile reaction platform. Three bismuth halide perovskites, Cs 3 Bi 2 Cl 9 , Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 , and Cs 4 MnBi 2 Cl 12 , were synthesized and characterized by their band gaps (E g ); Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 presented the lowest E g and was therefore chosen for further evaluation as potential CO 2 -reduction photocatalyst. Aqueous-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was achieved using this perovskite in the microreactor, obtaining CO as a reduction product with maximal production rates of 737 &#956;mol g cat -1 h -1 . The reaction system was evaluated under different flow rates and light intensities. A balance between space-time and reactant feed was found to define the behavior of CO concentration and production in the microreactor. For the light intensity, it was observed that as it increased, both CO production and concentration increased due to generating more electron-hole pairs, favoring the photocatalytic reaction. With these results, Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 perovskite immobilized in the designed microreactor demonstrates having great potential as an effective CO 2 photocatalytic reduction system.&amp;amp;#xD;</description>

                Catalysts involving post&#8208;transition metals have shown almost invincible performance on generating formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Conversely, Cu without post&#8208;transition metals have struggled to achieve comparable activity. In this study, a sulfur (S)&#8208;doped&#8208;copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalyst is developed, exhibiting excellent performance in formate generation with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 92% and a partial current density of 321 mA cm&#8208;2. Ex&#8208;situ structural elucidations reveal the presence of abundant grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8208;S bonds from the covellite phase during CO2RR. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that S&#8208;S bonds can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates, further improving the activity of the formate pathway. This work is significant in modifying a low&#8208;cost catalyst (Cu) with a non&#8208;metallic substance (S) to achieve comparable performance to mainstream catalysts for formate generation in industrial grade.</description>

      <title>Full-exposed Cu site of Cu2O-(1 0 0) driven high ethylene selectivity of carbon dioxide reduction</title>

                Cu2O shows great potential as a catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR). However, the mechanism behind the formation of different final products from Cu2O nanostructures remains a challenge. In this study, we combine theoretical and experimental approaches to demonstrate that the full-exposed Cu sites in Cu2O (1 0 0) microcubes contribute to superior C2H4 selectivity compared to other microstructures such as Cu2O (1 1 1), (1 1 0), and (3 1 1) facets. Density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations reveal that the stronger orbital splitting between Cu 3d and O 2p orbital of Cu2O (1 0 0) facet facilitates the formation of neighboring and low valence state Cu active site, thereby enhancing *CO adsorption and C2H4 formation. These DFT results are supported by the synthesis of four kinds of Cu2O microparticles (MPs) with different exposed facets, where cubic-Cu2O with the (1 0 0) facet exhibits the highest Faradaic efficiency (61.3 %). This study has significant implications for the structural design and mechanism analysis of innovative catalysts used in ECO2RR.</description>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction is considered a promising solution to mitigate the increasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Despite the promising potential of this process, highly active catalysts are needed to enable its efficient operation. Mixed metal oxide (MMO) materials can promote the formation of a dynamic interface between a metal and its oxidized form under applied potential, resulting in a unique interaction with the reaction intermediates. We synthesized a Pd&#8211;Mo MMO with controlled size and composition and examined the effect of these properties on CO2 electroreduction. Electron microscopy images confirmed the homogeneous distribution of the synthesized Pd7Mo1 on a ZIF-8-derived porous carbon support, with sizes of &#8764;1.3 and 4.5 nm for the samples annealed at 200 and 400 &#176;C, respectively. As shown by density functional theory calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, adding 12.5 % Mo altered the electronic structure of Pd, enhancing CO desorption, and reducing the potential needed for CO production by up to &#8764;0.2 V, corresponding to a &#8764;40 % higher partial CO current density compared to pure Pd. This work demonstrates a facile MMO synthesis enabling particle size and composition control, which will facilitate the development of highly active MMO-derived nanoalloy materials for CO2 electroreduction.</description>

      <title>Nature AND Nurture: Enabling formate-dependent growth in Methanosarcina acetivorans</title>

                Methanogens are essential players in the global carbon cycle. Methanosarcinales possess one of the most diverse metabolic repertoires for methanogenesis, but they have never been observed to utilize formate as a substrate. We successfully reprogrammed the primary metabolism of Methanosarcina acetivorans by introducing an exogenous formate dehydrogenase derived from a closely related species. The engineered strains acquired the capacity to harness energy from formate-dependent methanogenesis pathways, including formate-dependent methyl reduction and formate-dependent carbon dioxide reduction. The ability of M. acetivorans to thrive on formate suggests the existence of essential accessory machinery and metabolic redundancy for generating reduced ferredoxins from F420H2. This remarkable plasticity in energy metabolism raises the possibility that an ancestral lineage of Methanosarcinales may have possessed the capacity to utilize formate. By combining this genetically modified strain with a disruption in methyl disproportionation, we have created a novel tool for investigating and manipulating the components of the F420 reduction and methanogenesis pathways independently.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR) is gaining momentum as an effective process to capture and convert CO 2 into valuable chemicals and fuels, as well as to contribute reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes) are increasingly attracting attention as CO 2 RR electrocatalysts due to their enhanced chemical activity and selectivity, overcoming limitations of traditional metal CO 2 RR electrocatalysts, and likely breaking the scaling relations of reaction intermediates toward the desired product. The present concept reviews the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the computational description of CO 2 RR on MXenes, going from CO 2 activation on pristine models to different surface terminations, and discuss possible ways to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity, including doping, defects, supported single metal atoms, solvent effects, and electric field effects, while putting in the spotlight prospects by including kinetic aspects.</description>

                Carbon capture and conversion are becoming increasingly important as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise and their adverse effects become increasingly evident. CO2 conversion/utilization-related research has gained renewed interest on a variety of platforms, including thermal, solar, biological, photochemical, and electrochemical conversions. Electrochemical routes, using suitable catalysts, are potentially suitable for commercial purposes owing to ease of integration with solvent-based carbon capture processes. This paper summarizes and evaluates the studies conducted within the past decade regarding the feasibility of carbon-based supports utilized in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. CO2 conversion has been reviewed in a number of reports, focusing on specific sections, such as metallic/bimetallic catalysts, CO2 solubility, and the fabrication of electrodes and electrochemical cells. The number of publications addressing various carbon-based electrocatalysts is increasing, but these materials have not yet been reviewed. Herein, we are focused on three types of electrocatalyst materials: metals, metal-oxides, non-oxides, and combinations thereof with carbon. The scope of this study includes the following: i) carbon-based materials and how they are characterized by distinctive properties, ii) electrocatalytic CO2 conversion techniques, and iii) research cases for carbon allotrope-supported composites used in CO2 reduction. The advancement in analytical tools that provide insight into liquid-phase reactions will benefit the development of catalysts and electrodes that will be effective in converting CO2 into the desired products. Such developments will also be applicable to other systems involving liquid electrolytes or solvents for performing reactions on catalyst surfaces.</description>

                This study reports the accuracy and applications of an attenuated total reflectance&#8211;surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8211;SEIRAS) technique to indirectly measure the interfacial pH of the electrolyte using the ratio of phosphate species within 10 nm of the electrocatalyst surface. This technique can be used in situ to study aqueous electrochemical reactions with a calibration range from pH 1&#8211;13, time resolution down to 4 s, and an average 95% confidence interval of 14% that varies depending on the pH region (acidic, neutral, or basic). The method is applied in this study to electrochemical nitrate reduction at a copper cathode to demonstrate its capabilities, but is broadly applicable to any aqueous electrochemical reaction (such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, or oxygen evolution) and the electrocatalyst may be any SEIRAS-active thin film (e.g., silver, gold, or copper). The time-resolved results show a dramatic increase in the interfacial pH from pH 2&#8211;7 in the first minute of operation during both constant current and pulsed current experiments where the bulk pH is unchanged. Attempts to control the pH polarization at the surface by altering the electrochemical operating conditions&#8212;lowering the current or increasing the pulse frequency&#8212;showed no significant change, demonstrating the challenge of controlling the interfacial pH.</description>

      <title>Regulating CHO* intermediate pathway towards the significant acceleration of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 through rGO-coated ultrafine Pd nanoparticles</title>

                Tailoring catalytic reaction pathways by using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to tune the electron-hole separation channels in the active sites of noble metals for achieving ideal yield and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction of hydrocarbon fuels remains a challenge. Herein, ternary catalyst of rGO-coated SnO2-supported noble metal Pd nanoparticles (Pd4/SnO2@rGO) has been prepared by coassembly between negatively charged graphene oxide and positively charged Pd nanoparticles. By coating with ultrathin rGO, the selectivity can be shifted from CO (44.69 % for Pd4/SnO2) toward CH4 as the prevalent species, in which the Pd nanoparticles acted as catalytic sites and electron capture sites. The rGO coating reduced the recombination of the photogenerated carriers as well as optimized the band gap and reduction potential of the catalyst. The in situ spectroscopic tests and density functional theory calculations revealed that CO2 adsorbed on Pd nanoparticles selectively formed dominant low-energy CHO* intermediates because of the generation of HCOOH* intermediates, thus providing a unique reaction pathway for the reduction of CO2 to CH4. Therefore, under sunlight irradiation, the CH4 selectivity of the catalyst is enhanced to 94.1 % with a production rate of up to 77.8 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1. This work demonstrated the prospect to tune the electronic structure of Pd using rGO, which provided a strategy for enhancing the carbon dioxide reduction reaction and selectively obtaining CH4 products in photocatalytic systems.</description>

                Abstract Single&#8208;atom catalysts possess great potential for applications in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions. Recently, the fast and low&#8208;cost preparation of highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts remains a challenge. Herein, a high&#8208;density current generated by pulsed discharge is employed for the formation of graphene aerogel anchored Cu single atom catalysts perfectly. The Cu atoms decomposed by Cu(NO 3 ) 2 &#8226;xH 2 O are fixed on graphene under the local transient high temperature and intense electromagnetic field. The activity and selectivity of formic acid are correlated with the coordinatively unsaturated Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 moieties, reaching an optimal Faradaic efficiency (93.7%) at &#8722;0.9 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In situ characterizations reveal that the asymmetric Cu&#9472;N/O structure in a pinched state displays better catalytic activity in CO 2 RR. Density functional theory results indicate that the Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 sites regulate the adsorption configuration of intermediates and lower the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of * OCHO species, thereby promoting CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion.</description>

      <title>Site Selection Evaluation of Co2 Storage in Saline Aquifers of Zhuyi Depression, the Pearl River Mouth Basin</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4691481</link>

                CO2 geological storage is the primary means of achieving large-scale, low-cost carbon dioxide reduction. Compared with onshore basins, sequestration in offshore basins has the advantages of larger storage volume and less impact on people and the environment. At the same time, there are also challenges such as high cost and technical difficulty for sequestration. At present, there are many researches on the selection and suitability evaluation of CCS in China, and there are also very successful demonstration applications, while the research on CO2 geological storage in sea areas is relatively few. Taking Zhuyi Depression of Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South China Sea as an example in this paper, with the goal of meeting the storage capacity of one million tons per year. Making statistics on the factors affecting the suitability of CO2 storage of oil and gas-bearing structures in the depression from three aspects: geological characteristics, storage economy and storage safety, and constructs a screening index system of CO2 geological storage field, which includes 3 levels and 18 evaluation factors. The index weight of each evaluation factor is calculated by AHP. The suitability of CO2 sealing of selected oil and gas-bearing structures is quantitatively evaluated by multi-source information overlap analysis. The results show that the Xijiang 23 and other oil-bearing structures in the west of Huizhou Sag have priority as the storage field. The results of this study can provide reference for the implementation and management decision of CO2 saline aquifers storage in this area.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction by borophene supported bimetallic catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.01.051</link>
      <description>Meiling Liu, Jayaraman Balamurugan, Tongxiang Liang, Chao Liu, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390766525

                Bimetal atom catalysts (BACs) hold significant potential for various applications as a result of the synergistic interaction between adjacent metal atoms. This interaction leads to improved catalytic performance, while simultaneously maintaining high atomic efficiency and exceptional selectivity, similar to single atom catalysts (SACs). Bimetallic site catalysts (M2&#946;12) supported by &#946;12-borophene were developed as catalysts for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The research on density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that M2&#946;12 exhibits exceptional stability, conductivity, and catalytic activity. Investigating the most efficient reaction pathway for CO2RR by analyzing the Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) during potential determining steps (PDS) and choosing a catalyst with outstanding catalytic performance for CO2RR. The overpotential required for Fe2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 to generate CO is merely 0.05 V. This implies that the conversion of CO2 to CO can be accomplished with minimal additional voltage. The overpotential values for Cu2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 during the formation of HCOOH were merely 0.001 and 0.07 V, respectively. Furthermore, the Rh2&#946;12 catalyst exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 0.51 V for CH3OH and 0.65 V for CH4. The Fe2&#946;12 produces C2H4 through the *CO-*CO pathway, while Ag2&#946;12 generates CH3CH2OH via the *CO-*CHO coupling pathway, with remarkably low overpotentials of 0.84 and 0.60 V, respectively. The study provides valuable insights for the systematic design and screening of electrocatalysts for CO2RR that exhibit exceptional catalytic performance and selectivity.</description>

      <title>CARBON TAX AND ITS EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY, TAXES AND ENVIRONMENT</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.56301/awl.v6i1.1013</link>
      <description>M.E. Retno Kadarukmi, Awang Long Law Review. 6(1)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4390652284

                This research discusses theoretically the relationship between carbon tax with economy, tax and environment. This research is a legal research with analytical descriptive nature, namely research that analyzes secondary data on issues related to carbon taxes as an instrument for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. According to secondary data, this research is aimed at discovering aspects of carbon tax design, collection of carbon taxes, and state management of carbon tax revenues. Carbon taxes are an effective and efficient instrument to support the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. To be implemented, a carbon tax must be feasible. Eligibility requires public acceptance. On the other hand, a carbon tax can create a lot of controversy. The main argument against carbon taxes is that carbon taxes do not always guarantee emission reductions. In addition, there are also concerns over the unintended effects of competitiveness, carbon leakage, and fears of unintended distributional impacts, which could be barriers to implementation.</description>

                China&#8217;s transition to a green, low-carbon economy is among the most essential elements needed to achieve the climate goals set down in the Paris Agreement. China has pledged it &#8220;will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060&#8221;.1 Given the currently high emissions level in China and an economic structure with significant share of industrial sector and fossil fuel consumption, it remains a formidable challenge to realize such steep emission reduction for the 30-60 goals, as we call them in this paper.</description>

      <title>Mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; Benefits from Superelevated CO2 While Adapting to Far-red Light Over Time</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21273/hortsci17522-23</link>
      <description>Emily J. Kennebeck, Qingguo Meng, Hortscience. 59(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390628599

                Compared with the ambient Earth carbon dioxide concentration (&#8776;415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), the International Space Station has superelevated carbon dioxide (&#8776;2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), which can be a stressor to certain crops. Far-red light can drive plant photosynthesis and increase extension growth and biomass. However, the effects of far-red light under superelevated carbon dioxide are unclear. We grew hydroponic mustard ( Brassica carinata ) &#8216;Amara&#8217; seedlings in four growth chambers using a randomized complete block design with two carbon dioxide concentrations (415 and 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), two lighting treatments, and two blocks at temperature and relative humidity set points of 22 &#176;C and 40%, respectively. Each growth chamber had two lighting treatments at the same total photon flux density of 200 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 . Under the same blue and green light at 50 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 each, plants received either red light at 100 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 or red + far-red light at 50 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 each. At day 15 after planting, far-red light did not influence shoot fresh or dry mass at 415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide, but decreased both parameters by 22% to 23% at 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration increased shoot fresh and dry mass 27% to 49%, regardless of the lighting treatment. Far-red light decreased leaf area by 16% at 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide, but had no effect at 415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration increased leaf area by 21% to 33%, regardless of far-red light. Regardless of the carbon dioxide concentration, far-red light promoted stem elongation and decreased chlorophyll concentrations by 39% to 42%. These responses indicate far-red light elicited a crop-specific shade avoidance response in mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217;, increasing extension growth but decreasing leaf area, thereby reducing light interception and biomass. In addition, carbon dioxide enrichment up to 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 increased the biomass of mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; but decreased the biomass of other crops, indicating crop-specific tolerance to superelevated carbon dioxide. In conclusion, mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; seedlings benefit from superelevated carbon dioxide, but exhibit growth reduction under far-red light under superelevated carbon dioxide.</description>

      <title>Influence of tillage methods on carbon dioxide emissions in spring wheat crops</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/20248206006</link>
      <description>Evgeniy Demin, Stanislav Miller, Kirill Likhanov, BIO web of conferences. 82(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390539980

                The agriculture intensification is associated with an increase in anthropogenic load on arable soils. Tillage leads to disruption of the natural process of soil formation in connection with which the soil biota activity changes and the carbon cycle is disrupted. The purpose of the study is to establish the effects of the tillage method on the carbon dioxide emission in spring wheat crops. The emission of carbon dioxide during the growing season of spring wheat varies significantly depending on the soil processing method and temperature. At the beginning of spring wheat development, the daily emission of carbon dioxide during the dump and subsurface tillage method does not exceed 36.0 and 36.2 CO 2 kg/ha using zero technology provides a reduction in production CO 2 production to 27.8 kg/ha*day. With an increase in soil temperature by July 24, the daily emission increases on a dump and subsurface background to 105.5 and 106.0 CO 2 kg/ha*day, on a zero background to 95.4 CO 2 kg/ha*day. In the future, it decreases. The total carbon losses during the dump and subsurface tillage methods are 2829 and 2793 kg/ha, the use of zero tillage technology reduces carbon losses in grain agrocenosis by 18%.</description>

      <title>Solar Water Heating: Comprehensive Review, Critical Analysis and Case Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.52843/cassyni.z0lx6v</link>
      <description>Amal Herez, No host. None(None)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4390616016

                The increasing global demand for renewable energy sources underscores the significance of Solar Water Heating Systems (SWHS), emphasizing the need for thorough research and analysis in this domain. SWHS play a pivotal role in addressing energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, making it imperative to conduct in-depth studies on their utilization. Hence, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of SWHS. It starts by explaining the principles behind these systems, including their components and classification. Moreover, this review consolidates various studies that have been conducted on SWHS to highlight both their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, a case study is conducted in which it takes into consideration important economic and environmental factors. In particular, it focuses on several scenarios present in Lebanon such as family homes, schools, restaurants hotels and gyms to estimate potential cost savings achieved through implementing SWHS as opposed to relying solely on electric heaters. Furthermore, this investigation also examines the corresponding payback period associated with adopting SWHS along with assessing the significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions possible if these systems were widely implemented. The findings of the study demonstrate that there is a direct correlation between the extent to which SWHS are utilized and both the payback period and reduction in CO2 emissions. It was observed that when SWHS are used more frequently, with a high percentage of time (Pr=0.9), significant advantages can be achieved. For instance, for different types of establishments such as family homes, schools, restaurants, hotels, and gyms, it was estimated that average payback periods would be 14.2 years, 4.6 years, 9.2 years, 4.4 years, and 5.3 years, respectively. These results indicate that adopting a greater dependency on SWHSs not only leads to quicker cost recovery but also significantly contributes towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The analysis reveals that the yearly decrease in carbon dioxide emissions per individual is 0.16 t within a household, 0.016 t per student in an educational institution, 0.04 t per customer within a dining establishment, 0.37 t for each occupied bed in a hotel accommodation, and 0.11 t per individual at a gym. This paper serves as guidelines to SWH community. Additionally, it adds a practical insights into economic and environmental issues relevant to both Lebanon and countries with similar climates.</description>

                The coal-based energy consumption structure has led to high coal consumption and carbon emissions in China's iron and steel industry, and the task of coal saving and carbon reduction in the steel industry is difficult and urgent. The economic viability of various coal-saving and emission-reduction technologies, the extent of their coal-saving and emission-reduction potential, and the guidance on the adoption of advanced technologies are crucial issues that need to be addressed in the Chinese steel industry. This article employs the Energy-Production (E-P) analysis method and the Conservation Supply Curve (CSC) model incorporating coal consumption ratio coefficients to systematically analyze coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the overall iron and steel industry and its sub-processes under different scenarios. It calculates the coal-saving emission reduction costs of 32 technologies, evaluates them comprehensively based on their coal-saving and emission-reduction potentials and cost-effectiveness, and categorizes them accordingly. According to the cost of coal saving and emission reduction as the demarcation point, a total of 19 technologies are cost-effective; according to the coal-saving emission reduction potential and cost division, 32 technologies are divided into 6 categories, among which 6 technologies such as sintering waste heat recovery technology can be used as key technologies for popularization and application. Seven technologies, such as efficient preheating technology of ladle, have high cost and low potential, which can be gradually eliminated or improved and upgraded. After the comprehensive promotion of the 32 technologies, the maximum coal saving potential is about 3.453 billion GJ, the CO2 emission reduction potential is 395 million tons, the total coal consumption of the steel industry can be reduced to about 13.904 billion GJ, and the carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced to 1.179 billion tons.</description>

                The development of floating photovoltaic systems in Romania can help to the share of more than 30.7 % of the total energy produced from renewable energy sources set for the year 2030. Floating photovoltaic plants ensure the achievement of overall energy targets without affecting biodiversity and/or agricultural crops. This study evaluates the insolation and the possibility of installing this technology on Lake F&#259;c&#259;u, Romania, to benefit from the generation of electricity but also better water quality and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$. The obtained results are promising as Floating photovoltaic plants covering around 0.22 % of the lake surface, provide 26.76 $M W h /$ year and the estimated reduction of CO &lt;inf xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt; emission is 7.52 $\mathbf{t C O}_{2 \mathrm{eq}} /$ year.</description>

                Abstract Carbon dioxide conversion into valuable products using photocatalysis and electrocatalysis is an effective approach to mitigate global environmental issues and the energy shortages. Among the materials utilized for catalytic reduction of CO 2 , Cu-based materials are highly advantageous owing to their widespread availability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, Cu-based materials demonstrate interesting abilities in the adsorption and activation of carbon dioxide, allowing the formation of C 2+ compounds through C&#8211;C coupling process. Herein, the basic principles of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions (PCO 2 RR) and electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (ECO 2 RR) and the pathways for the generation C 2+ products are introduced. This review categorizes Cu-based materials into different groups including Cu metal, Cu oxides, Cu alloys, and Cu SACs, Cu heterojunctions based on their catalytic applications. The relationship between the Cu surfaces and their efficiency in both PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR is emphasized. Through a review of recent studies on PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR using Cu-based catalysts, the focus is on understanding the underlying reasons for the enhanced selectivity toward C 2+ products. Finally, the opportunities and challenges associated with Cu-based materials in the CO 2 catalytic reduction applications are presented, along with research directions that can guide for the design of highly active and selective Cu-based materials for CO 2 reduction processes in the future.</description>

                Reaching net-zero emissions by the middle of this century requires the implementation of massive carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction strategies along with the reduction of other greenhouse gases on both global and country scales. Thus, carbon capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU) is a promising technology in combination with renewable energy transition. Currently, CO2 utilization has attracted much attention from the scientific community worldwide, since it can improve the economic viability of CCSU deployment by creating a market for the recovered CO2 stream. In this study, a brief assessment and comparison of potential CO2 utilization pathways in Uzbekistan, including CO2-to-chemical/fuel conversion, CO2 bio-fixation/mineralization, and the direct use of CO2, such as for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery (EHR), are conducted considering the CO2 stationary sources and site-specific conditions of the country. In addition, possible challenges and opportunities for large-scale CO2 utilization routes are also discussed. According to this assessment, there is great potential for the direct use of CO2 as a process-boosting agent for EHR in more than 22 major natural gas, crude oil, and coal reservoirs. Moreover, methanol and urea production processes can also create huge market demand for recovered CO2 as long as the conventional CO2 production processes are replaced by sustainable ones.</description>

      <title>Economic and emissions analysis of behind-the-meter energy storage with rooftop solar: a case study for Indian residential consumers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1049/icp.2023.3106</link>

                The global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels continue to rise, driven by rising energy use. Rooftop photovoltaic (RTPV) systems are an effective way to reduce emissions and, consequently, the carbon footprint for residential consumers. The use of behind-the-meter (BTM) energy storage with RTPV is a flexible and dependable method for generating electricity as it provides power to the customer even if there is an outage from the utility grid. It also reduces reliance on the utility through savings in the electricity bill and reducing CO2 emissions. In this paper, we analyse the economics and emissions along with the sizing of BTM battery storage co-located with RTPV for residential customers in India. Based on the power flow interactions between RTPV, grid, and battery storage, a techno-economic framework is built to compute the system&amp;apos;s life cycle costing. The life cycle cost of energy for BTM battery storage with RTPV to meet a 14-kWh energy demand is INR 11/kWh. We observe a 75% decrease in utility costs and a 58% reduction in CO2 emissions for the same system. The findings of this study can help policymakers, utilities, and homeowners make informed decisions regarding the adoption and integration of energy storage systems with residential solar PV installations.</description>

                Abstract Carbon budgets are quantifications of the total amount of carbon dioxide that can ever be emitted while keeping global warming below specific temperature limits. However, estimates of these budgets for limiting warming to 1.5 &#176;C and well-below 2 &#176;C include assumptions about how much warming can be expected from non-CO 2 emissions. Here, we uncover the non-CO 2 emissions assumptions that underlie the latest remaining carbon budget estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and quantify the implication of the world pursuing alternative higher or lower emissions. We consider contributions of methane, nitrous oxide, fluorinated gases, and aerosols and show how pursuing inadequate methane emission reductions causes remaining carbon budgets compatible with the Paris Agreement temperature limits to be exhausted today, effectively putting achievement of the Paris Agreement out of reach.</description>

      <title>Design a Reducing Co2 Emission System Using Nonfermentable Substrates for Carbon-Economic Biosynthesis of Poly-2-Hydrobutanedioic Acid</title>

                Reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the aerobic biorefinery system is becoming a crucial effort for achieving carbon-economic biosynthesis of biomaterials and chemicals. Poly-2-hydrobutanedioic acid (P2HBD), a long-carbon chain polyester produced by the fungus Aureobasidium pullulans, has garnered significant attention in the biomaterials and chemical industries. In this study, we designed a CO2 emission reduction system using nonfermentable substrates to enable efficient biosynthesis of P2HBD. Based on the genome-scale model iZX637 of A. pullulans, glycerol and ethanol were stimulated to show the potential advantages over glucose in terms of reduced CO2 emission. Additionally, we employed an NADH/NAD+ fluorescent probe called SoNar to dynamically monitor the reductive power ratio during CO2 emission. Subsequently, glycerol metabolism and rTCA carbon fixation pathway were engineered, while implementing a modular assembly strategy to achieve balanced integration between these two modules through precise promoter engineering regulation. The optimal strain ZX-LM03 showed the advantages of less carbon emission with glycerol and ethanol as the co-substrates, and achieved the higher P2HBD titer and yield of 15.07 &#177; 0.18 g/L and 0.54 &#177; 0.01 g/g, with the lower carbon emission of 31.08% compared to glucose in the 5 L fermenter. In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into achieving carbon neutrality using renewable substrates for reducing carbon emission in aerobic fermentation systems.</description>

                Abstract The rising concerns about CO 2 levels in the atmosphere and energy dependency on non-renewable sources, such as fossil fuels, could find an integral solution in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. The present work explores two alternatives to the main hindering factors for this reaction, i.e., the reactor configuration and the photocatalyst utilized. A microreactor was designed and 3D printed, providing a cheap and versatile reaction platform. Three bismuth halide perovskites, Cs 3 Bi 2 Cl 9 , Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 , and Cs 4 MnBi 2 Cl 12 , were synthesized and characterized by their band gaps (E g ); Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 presented the lowest E g and was therefore chosen for further evaluation as potential CO 2 -reduction photocatalyst. Aqueous-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was achieved using this perovskite in the microreactor, obtaining CO as a reduction product with maximal production rates of 737 &#956;mol g cat -1 h -1 . The reaction system was evaluated under different flow rates and light intensities. A balance between space-time and reactant feed was found to define the behavior of CO concentration and production in the microreactor. For the light intensity, it was observed that as it increased, both CO production and concentration increased due to generating more electron-hole pairs, favoring the photocatalytic reaction. With these results, Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 perovskite immobilized in the designed microreactor demonstrates having great potential as an effective CO 2 photocatalytic reduction system.&amp;amp;#xD;</description>

                Catalysts involving post&#8208;transition metals have shown almost invincible performance on generating formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Conversely, Cu without post&#8208;transition metals have struggled to achieve comparable activity. In this study, a sulfur (S)&#8208;doped&#8208;copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalyst is developed, exhibiting excellent performance in formate generation with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 92% and a partial current density of 321 mA cm&#8208;2. Ex&#8208;situ structural elucidations reveal the presence of abundant grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8208;S bonds from the covellite phase during CO2RR. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that S&#8208;S bonds can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates, further improving the activity of the formate pathway. This work is significant in modifying a low&#8208;cost catalyst (Cu) with a non&#8208;metallic substance (S) to achieve comparable performance to mainstream catalysts for formate generation in industrial grade.</description>

      <title>Full-exposed Cu site of Cu2O-(1 0 0) driven high ethylene selectivity of carbon dioxide reduction</title>

                Cu2O shows great potential as a catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR). However, the mechanism behind the formation of different final products from Cu2O nanostructures remains a challenge. In this study, we combine theoretical and experimental approaches to demonstrate that the full-exposed Cu sites in Cu2O (1 0 0) microcubes contribute to superior C2H4 selectivity compared to other microstructures such as Cu2O (1 1 1), (1 1 0), and (3 1 1) facets. Density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations reveal that the stronger orbital splitting between Cu 3d and O 2p orbital of Cu2O (1 0 0) facet facilitates the formation of neighboring and low valence state Cu active site, thereby enhancing *CO adsorption and C2H4 formation. These DFT results are supported by the synthesis of four kinds of Cu2O microparticles (MPs) with different exposed facets, where cubic-Cu2O with the (1 0 0) facet exhibits the highest Faradaic efficiency (61.3 %). This study has significant implications for the structural design and mechanism analysis of innovative catalysts used in ECO2RR.</description>

      <description>Devina Thasia Wijaya, Chan Woo Lee, Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390546350

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction is considered a promising solution to mitigate the increasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Despite the promising potential of this process, highly active catalysts are needed to enable its efficient operation. Mixed metal oxide (MMO) materials can promote the formation of a dynamic interface between a metal and its oxidized form under applied potential, resulting in a unique interaction with the reaction intermediates. We synthesized a Pd&#8211;Mo MMO with controlled size and composition and examined the effect of these properties on CO2 electroreduction. Electron microscopy images confirmed the homogeneous distribution of the synthesized Pd7Mo1 on a ZIF-8-derived porous carbon support, with sizes of &#8764;1.3 and 4.5 nm for the samples annealed at 200 and 400 &#176;C, respectively. As shown by density functional theory calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, adding 12.5 % Mo altered the electronic structure of Pd, enhancing CO desorption, and reducing the potential needed for CO production by up to &#8764;0.2 V, corresponding to a &#8764;40 % higher partial CO current density compared to pure Pd. This work demonstrates a facile MMO synthesis enabling particle size and composition control, which will facilitate the development of highly active MMO-derived nanoalloy materials for CO2 electroreduction.</description>

      <title>Nature AND Nurture: Enabling formate-dependent growth in Methanosarcina acetivorans</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.01.08.574737</link>

                Methanogens are essential players in the global carbon cycle. Methanosarcinales possess one of the most diverse metabolic repertoires for methanogenesis, but they have never been observed to utilize formate as a substrate. We successfully reprogrammed the primary metabolism of Methanosarcina acetivorans by introducing an exogenous formate dehydrogenase derived from a closely related species. The engineered strains acquired the capacity to harness energy from formate-dependent methanogenesis pathways, including formate-dependent methyl reduction and formate-dependent carbon dioxide reduction. The ability of M. acetivorans to thrive on formate suggests the existence of essential accessory machinery and metabolic redundancy for generating reduced ferredoxins from F420H2. This remarkable plasticity in energy metabolism raises the possibility that an ancestral lineage of Methanosarcinales may have possessed the capacity to utilize formate. By combining this genetically modified strain with a disruption in methyl disproportionation, we have created a novel tool for investigating and manipulating the components of the F420 reduction and methanogenesis pathways independently.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR) is gaining momentum as an effective process to capture and convert CO 2 into valuable chemicals and fuels, as well as to contribute reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes) are increasingly attracting attention as CO 2 RR electrocatalysts due to their enhanced chemical activity and selectivity, overcoming limitations of traditional metal CO 2 RR electrocatalysts, and likely breaking the scaling relations of reaction intermediates toward the desired product. The present concept reviews the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the computational description of CO 2 RR on MXenes, going from CO 2 activation on pristine models to different surface terminations, and discuss possible ways to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity, including doping, defects, supported single metal atoms, solvent effects, and electric field effects, while putting in the spotlight prospects by including kinetic aspects.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.01.022</link>
      <description>Afdhal Yuda, Parisa Ebrahimi, Josephine Selvaraj, Anand Kumar, Vaidyanathan Subramanian, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy. 57(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390721078

                Carbon capture and conversion are becoming increasingly important as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise and their adverse effects become increasingly evident. CO2 conversion/utilization-related research has gained renewed interest on a variety of platforms, including thermal, solar, biological, photochemical, and electrochemical conversions. Electrochemical routes, using suitable catalysts, are potentially suitable for commercial purposes owing to ease of integration with solvent-based carbon capture processes. This paper summarizes and evaluates the studies conducted within the past decade regarding the feasibility of carbon-based supports utilized in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. CO2 conversion has been reviewed in a number of reports, focusing on specific sections, such as metallic/bimetallic catalysts, CO2 solubility, and the fabrication of electrodes and electrochemical cells. The number of publications addressing various carbon-based electrocatalysts is increasing, but these materials have not yet been reviewed. Herein, we are focused on three types of electrocatalyst materials: metals, metal-oxides, non-oxides, and combinations thereof with carbon. The scope of this study includes the following: i) carbon-based materials and how they are characterized by distinctive properties, ii) electrocatalytic CO2 conversion techniques, and iii) research cases for carbon allotrope-supported composites used in CO2 reduction. The advancement in analytical tools that provide insight into liquid-phase reactions will benefit the development of catalysts and electrodes that will be effective in converting CO2 into the desired products. Such developments will also be applicable to other systems involving liquid electrolytes or solvents for performing reactions on catalyst surfaces.</description>

      <title>ATR&#8211;SEIRAS Method to Measure Interfacial pH during Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction on Cu</title>

                This study reports the accuracy and applications of an attenuated total reflectance&#8211;surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8211;SEIRAS) technique to indirectly measure the interfacial pH of the electrolyte using the ratio of phosphate species within 10 nm of the electrocatalyst surface. This technique can be used in situ to study aqueous electrochemical reactions with a calibration range from pH 1&#8211;13, time resolution down to 4 s, and an average 95% confidence interval of 14% that varies depending on the pH region (acidic, neutral, or basic). The method is applied in this study to electrochemical nitrate reduction at a copper cathode to demonstrate its capabilities, but is broadly applicable to any aqueous electrochemical reaction (such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, or oxygen evolution) and the electrocatalyst may be any SEIRAS-active thin film (e.g., silver, gold, or copper). The time-resolved results show a dramatic increase in the interfacial pH from pH 2&#8211;7 in the first minute of operation during both constant current and pulsed current experiments where the bulk pH is unchanged.

                Tailoring catalytic reaction pathways by using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to tune the electron-hole separation channels in the active sites of noble metals for achieving ideal yield and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction of hydrocarbon fuels remains a challenge. Herein, ternary catalyst of rGO-coated SnO2-supported noble metal Pd nanoparticles (Pd4/SnO2@rGO) has been prepared by coassembly between negatively charged graphene oxide and positively charged Pd nanoparticles. By coating with ultrathin rGO, the selectivity can be shifted from CO (44.69 % for Pd4/SnO2) toward CH4 as the prevalent species, in which the Pd nanoparticles acted as catalytic sites and electron capture sites. The rGO coating reduced the recombination of the photogenerated carriers as well as optimized the band gap and reduction potential of the catalyst. The in situ spectroscopic tests and density functional theory calculations revealed that CO2 adsorbed on Pd nanoparticles selectively formed dominant low-energy CHO* intermediates because of the generation of HCOOH* intermediates, thus providing a unique reaction pathway for the reduction of CO2 to CH4. Therefore, under sunlight irradiation, the CH4 selectivity of the catalyst is enhanced to 94.1 % with a production rate of up to 77.8 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1. This work demonstrated the prospect to tune the electronic structure of Pd using rGO, which provided a strategy for enhancing the carbon dioxide reduction reaction and selectively obtaining CH4 products in photocatalytic systems.</description>

                Abstract Single&#8208;atom catalysts possess great potential for applications in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions. Recently, the fast and low&#8208;cost preparation of highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts remains a challenge. Herein, a high&#8208;density current generated by pulsed discharge is employed for the formation of graphene aerogel anchored Cu single atom catalysts perfectly. The Cu atoms decomposed by Cu(NO 3 ) 2 &#8226;xH 2 O are fixed on graphene under the local transient high temperature and intense electromagnetic field. The activity and selectivity of formic acid are correlated with the coordinatively unsaturated Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 moieties, reaching an optimal Faradaic efficiency (93.7%) at &#8722;0.9 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In situ characterizations reveal that the asymmetric Cu&#9472;N/O structure in a pinched state displays better catalytic activity in CO 2 RR. Density functional theory results indicate that the Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 sites regulate the adsorption configuration of intermediates and lower the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of * OCHO species, thereby promoting CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion.</description>

      <title>Site Selection Evaluation of Co2 Storage in Saline Aquifers of Zhuyi Depression, the Pearl River Mouth Basin</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4691481</link>

                CO2 geological storage is the primary means of achieving large-scale, low-cost carbon dioxide reduction. Compared with onshore basins, sequestration in offshore basins has the advantages of larger storage volume and less impact on people and the environment. At the same time, there are also challenges such as high cost and technical difficulty for sequestration. At present, there are many researches on the selection and suitability evaluation of CCS in China, and there are also very successful demonstration applications, while the research on CO2 geological storage in sea areas is relatively few. Taking Zhuyi Depression of Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South China Sea as an example in this paper, with the goal of meeting the storage capacity of one million tons per year. Making statistics on the factors affecting the suitability of CO2 storage of oil and gas-bearing structures in the depression from three aspects: geological characteristics, storage economy and storage safety, and constructs a screening index system of CO2 geological storage field, which includes 3 levels and 18 evaluation factors. The index weight of each evaluation factor is calculated by AHP. The suitability of CO2 sealing of selected oil and gas-bearing structures is quantitatively evaluated by multi-source information overlap analysis. The results show that the Xijiang 23 and other oil-bearing structures in the west of Huizhou Sag have priority as the storage field. The results of this study can provide reference for the implementation and management decision of CO2 saline aquifers storage in this area.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction by borophene supported bimetallic catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.01.051</link>
      <description>Meiling Liu, Jayaraman Balamurugan, Tongxiang Liang, Chao Liu, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390766525

                Bimetal atom catalysts (BACs) hold significant potential for various applications as a result of the synergistic interaction between adjacent metal atoms. This interaction leads to improved catalytic performance, while simultaneously maintaining high atomic efficiency and exceptional selectivity, similar to single atom catalysts (SACs). Bimetallic site catalysts (M2&#946;12) supported by &#946;12-borophene were developed as catalysts for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The research on density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that M2&#946;12 exhibits exceptional stability, conductivity, and catalytic activity. Investigating the most efficient reaction pathway for CO2RR by analyzing the Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) during potential determining steps (PDS) and choosing a catalyst with outstanding catalytic performance for CO2RR. The overpotential required for Fe2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 to generate CO is merely 0.05 V. This implies that the conversion of CO2 to CO can be accomplished with minimal additional voltage. The overpotential values for Cu2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 during the formation of HCOOH were merely 0.001 and 0.07 V, respectively. Furthermore, the Rh2&#946;12 catalyst exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 0.51 V for CH3OH and 0.65 V for CH4. The Fe2&#946;12 produces C2H4 through the *CO-*CO pathway, while Ag2&#946;12 generates CH3CH2OH via the *CO-*CHO coupling pathway, with remarkably low overpotentials of 0.84 and 0.60 V, respectively. The study provides valuable insights for the systematic design and screening of electrocatalysts for CO2RR that exhibit exceptional catalytic performance and selectivity.</description>

      <title>CARBON TAX AND ITS EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY, TAXES AND ENVIRONMENT</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.56301/awl.v6i1.1013</link>
      <description>M.E. Retno Kadarukmi, Awang Long Law Review. 6(1)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4390652284

                This research discusses theoretically the relationship between carbon tax with economy, tax and environment. This research is a legal research with analytical descriptive nature, namely research that analyzes secondary data on issues related to carbon taxes as an instrument for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. According to secondary data, this research is aimed at discovering aspects of carbon tax design, collection of carbon taxes, and state management of carbon tax revenues. Carbon taxes are an effective and efficient instrument to support the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. To be implemented, a carbon tax must be feasible. Eligibility requires public acceptance. On the other hand, a carbon tax can create a lot of controversy. The main argument against carbon taxes is that carbon taxes do not always guarantee emission reductions. In addition, there are also concerns over the unintended effects of competitiveness, carbon leakage, and fears of unintended distributional impacts, which could be barriers to implementation.</description>

                China&#8217;s transition to a green, low-carbon economy is among the most essential elements needed to achieve the climate goals set down in the Paris Agreement. China has pledged it &#8220;will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060&#8221;.1 Given the currently high emissions level in China and an economic structure with significant share of industrial sector and fossil fuel consumption, it remains a formidable challenge to realize such steep emission reduction for the 30-60 goals, as we call them in this paper.</description>

      <title>Mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; Benefits from Superelevated CO2 While Adapting to Far-red Light Over Time</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21273/hortsci17522-23</link>
      <description>Emily J. Kennebeck, Qingguo Meng, Hortscience. 59(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390628599

                Compared with the ambient Earth carbon dioxide concentration (&#8776;415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), the International Space Station has superelevated carbon dioxide (&#8776;2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), which can be a stressor to certain crops. Far-red light can drive plant photosynthesis and increase extension growth and biomass. However, the effects of far-red light under superelevated carbon dioxide are unclear. We grew hydroponic mustard ( Brassica carinata ) &#8216;Amara&#8217; seedlings in four growth chambers using a randomized complete block design with two carbon dioxide concentrations (415 and 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), two lighting treatments, and two blocks at temperature and relative humidity set points of 22 &#176;C and 40%, respectively. Each growth chamber had two lighting treatments at the same total photon flux density of 200 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 . Under the same blue and green light at 50 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 each, plants received either red light at 100 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 or red + far-red light at 50 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 each. At day 15 after planting, far-red light did not influence shoot fresh or dry mass at 415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide, but decreased both parameters by 22% to 23% at 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration increased shoot fresh and dry mass 27% to 49%, regardless of the lighting treatment. Far-red light decreased leaf area by 16% at 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide, but had no effect at 415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration increased leaf area by 21% to 33%, regardless of far-red light. Regardless of the carbon dioxide concentration, far-red light promoted stem elongation and decreased chlorophyll concentrations by 39% to 42%. These responses indicate far-red light elicited a crop-specific shade avoidance response in mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217;, increasing extension growth but decreasing leaf area, thereby reducing light interception and biomass. In addition, carbon dioxide enrichment up to 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 increased the biomass of mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; but decreased the biomass of other crops, indicating crop-specific tolerance to superelevated carbon dioxide. In conclusion, mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; seedlings benefit from superelevated carbon dioxide, but exhibit growth reduction under far-red light under superelevated carbon dioxide.</description>

      <title>Influence of tillage methods on carbon dioxide emissions in spring wheat crops</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/20248206006</link>
      <description>Evgeniy Demin, Stanislav Miller, Kirill Likhanov, BIO web of conferences. 82(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390539980

                The agriculture intensification is associated with an increase in anthropogenic load on arable soils. Tillage leads to disruption of the natural process of soil formation in connection with which the soil biota activity changes and the carbon cycle is disrupted. The purpose of the study is to establish the effects of the tillage method on the carbon dioxide emission in spring wheat crops. The emission of carbon dioxide during the growing season of spring wheat varies significantly depending on the soil processing method and temperature. At the beginning of spring wheat development, the daily emission of carbon dioxide during the dump and subsurface tillage method does not exceed 36.0 and 36.2 CO 2 kg/ha using zero technology provides a reduction in production CO 2 production to 27.8 kg/ha*day. With an increase in soil temperature by July 24, the daily emission increases on a dump and subsurface background to 105.5 and 106.0 CO 2 kg/ha*day, on a zero background to 95.4 CO 2 kg/ha*day. In the future, it decreases. The total carbon losses during the dump and subsurface tillage methods are 2829 and 2793 kg/ha, the use of zero tillage technology reduces carbon losses in grain agrocenosis by 18%.</description>

      <title>Solar Water Heating: Comprehensive Review, Critical Analysis and Case Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.52843/cassyni.z0lx6v</link>
      <description>Amal Herez, No host. None(None)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4390616016

                The increasing global demand for renewable energy sources underscores the significance of Solar Water Heating Systems (SWHS), emphasizing the need for thorough research and analysis in this domain. SWHS play a pivotal role in addressing energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, making it imperative to conduct in-depth studies on their utilization. Hence, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of SWHS. It starts by explaining the principles behind these systems, including their components and classification. Moreover, this review consolidates various studies that have been conducted on SWHS to highlight both their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, a case study is conducted in which it takes into consideration important economic and environmental factors. In particular, it focuses on several scenarios present in Lebanon such as family homes, schools, restaurants hotels and gyms to estimate potential cost savings achieved through implementing SWHS as opposed to relying solely on electric heaters. Furthermore, this investigation also examines the corresponding payback period associated with adopting SWHS along with assessing the significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions possible if these systems were widely implemented. The findings of the study demonstrate that there is a direct correlation between the extent to which SWHS are utilized and both the payback period and reduction in CO2 emissions. It was observed that when SWHS are used more frequently, with a high percentage of time (Pr=0.9), significant advantages can be achieved. For instance, for different types of establishments such as family homes, schools, restaurants, hotels, and gyms, it was estimated that average payback periods would be 14.2 years, 4.6 years, 9.2 years, 4.4 years, and 5.3 years, respectively. These results indicate that adopting a greater dependency on SWHSs not only leads to quicker cost recovery but also significantly contributes towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The analysis reveals that the yearly decrease in carbon dioxide emissions per individual is 0.16 t within a household, 0.016 t per student in an educational institution, 0.04 t per customer within a dining establishment, 0.37 t for each occupied bed in a hotel accommodation, and 0.11 t per individual at a gym. This paper serves as guidelines to SWH community. Additionally, it adds a practical insights into economic and environmental issues relevant to both Lebanon and countries with similar climates.</description>

                The coal-based energy consumption structure has led to high coal consumption and carbon emissions in China's iron and steel industry, and the task of coal saving and carbon reduction in the steel industry is difficult and urgent. The economic viability of various coal-saving and emission-reduction technologies, the extent of their coal-saving and emission-reduction potential, and the guidance on the adoption of advanced technologies are crucial issues that need to be addressed in the Chinese steel industry. This article employs the Energy-Production (E-P) analysis method and the Conservation Supply Curve (CSC) model incorporating coal consumption ratio coefficients to systematically analyze coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the overall iron and steel industry and its sub-processes under different scenarios. It calculates the coal-saving emission reduction costs of 32 technologies, evaluates them comprehensively based on their coal-saving and emission-reduction potentials and cost-effectiveness, and categorizes them accordingly. According to the cost of coal saving and emission reduction as the demarcation point, a total of 19 technologies are cost-effective; according to the coal-saving emission reduction potential and cost division, 32 technologies are divided into 6 categories, among which 6 technologies such as sintering waste heat recovery technology can be used as key technologies for popularization and application. Seven technologies, such as efficient preheating technology of ladle, have high cost and low potential, which can be gradually eliminated or improved and upgraded. After the comprehensive promotion of the 32 technologies, the maximum coal saving potential is about 3.453 billion GJ, the CO2 emission reduction potential is 395 million tons, the total coal consumption of the steel industry can be reduced to about 13.904 billion GJ, and the carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced to 1.179 billion tons.</description>

                Abstract Carbon dioxide conversion into valuable products using photocatalysis and electrocatalysis is an effective approach to mitigate global environmental issues and the energy shortages. Among the materials utilized for catalytic reduction of CO 2 , Cu-based materials are highly advantageous owing to their widespread availability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, Cu-based materials demonstrate interesting abilities in the adsorption and activation of carbon dioxide, allowing the formation of C 2+ compounds through C&#8211;C coupling process. Herein, the basic principles of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions (PCO 2 RR) and electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (ECO 2 RR) and the pathways for the generation C 2+ products are introduced. This review categorizes Cu-based materials into different groups including Cu metal, Cu oxides, Cu alloys, and Cu SACs, Cu heterojunctions based on their catalytic applications. The relationship between the Cu surfaces and their efficiency in both PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR is emphasized. Through a review of recent studies on PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR using Cu-based catalysts, the focus is on understanding the underlying reasons for the enhanced selectivity toward C 2+ products. Finally, the opportunities and challenges associated with Cu-based materials in the CO 2 catalytic reduction applications are presented, along with research directions that can guide for the design of highly active and selective Cu-based materials for CO 2 reduction processes in the future.</description>

                Reaching net-zero emissions by the middle of this century requires the implementation of massive carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction strategies along with the reduction of other greenhouse gases on both global and country scales. Thus, carbon capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU) is a promising technology in combination with renewable energy transition. Currently, CO2 utilization has attracted much attention from the scientific community worldwide, since it can improve the economic viability of CCSU deployment by creating a market for the recovered CO2 stream. In this study, a brief assessment and comparison of potential CO2 utilization pathways in Uzbekistan, including CO2-to-chemical/fuel conversion, CO2 bio-fixation/mineralization, and the direct use of CO2, such as for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery (EHR), are conducted considering the CO2 stationary sources and site-specific conditions of the country. In addition, possible challenges and opportunities for large-scale CO2 utilization routes are also discussed. According to this assessment, there is great potential for the direct use of CO2 as a process-boosting agent for EHR in more than 22 major natural gas, crude oil, and coal reservoirs. Moreover, methanol and urea production processes can also create huge market demand for recovered CO2 as long as the conventional CO2 production processes are replaced by sustainable ones.</description>

                The global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels continue to rise, driven by rising energy use. Rooftop photovoltaic (RTPV) systems are an effective way to reduce emissions and, consequently, the carbon footprint for residential consumers. The use of behind-the-meter (BTM) energy storage with RTPV is a flexible and dependable method for generating electricity as it provides power to the customer even if there is an outage from the utility grid. It also reduces reliance on the utility through savings in the electricity bill and reducing CO2 emissions. In this paper, we analyse the economics and emissions along with the sizing of BTM battery storage co-located with RTPV for residential customers in India. Based on the power flow interactions between RTPV, grid, and battery storage, a techno-economic framework is built to compute the system&amp;apos;s life cycle costing. The life cycle cost of energy for BTM battery storage with RTPV to meet a 14-kWh energy demand is INR 11/kWh. We observe a 75% decrease in utility costs and a 58% reduction in CO2 emissions for the same system. The findings of this study can help policymakers, utilities, and homeowners make informed decisions regarding the adoption and integration of energy storage systems with residential solar PV installations.</description>

                Abstract Carbon budgets are quantifications of the total amount of carbon dioxide that can ever be emitted while keeping global warming below specific temperature limits. However, estimates of these budgets for limiting warming to 1.5 &#176;C and well-below 2 &#176;C include assumptions about how much warming can be expected from non-CO 2 emissions. Here, we uncover the non-CO 2 emissions assumptions that underlie the latest remaining carbon budget estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and quantify the implication of the world pursuing alternative higher or lower emissions. We consider contributions of methane, nitrous oxide, fluorinated gases, and aerosols and show how pursuing inadequate methane emission reductions causes remaining carbon budgets compatible with the Paris Agreement temperature limits to be exhausted today, effectively putting achievement of the Paris Agreement out of reach.</description>

                Reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the aerobic biorefinery system is becoming a crucial effort for achieving carbon-economic biosynthesis of biomaterials and chemicals. Poly-2-hydrobutanedioic acid (P2HBD), a long-carbon chain polyester produced by the fungus Aureobasidium pullulans, has garnered significant attention in the biomaterials and chemical industries. In this study, we designed a CO2 emission reduction system using nonfermentable substrates to enable efficient biosynthesis of P2HBD. Based on the genome-scale model iZX637 of A. pullulans, glycerol and ethanol were stimulated to show the potential advantages over glucose in terms of reduced CO2 emission. Additionally, we employed an NADH/NAD+ fluorescent probe called SoNar to dynamically monitor the reductive power ratio during CO2 emission. Subsequently, glycerol metabolism and rTCA carbon fixation pathway were engineered, while implementing a modular assembly strategy to achieve balanced integration between these two modules through precise promoter engineering regulation. The optimal strain ZX-LM03 showed the advantages of less carbon emission with glycerol and ethanol as the co-substrates, and achieved the higher P2HBD titer and yield of 15.07 &#177; 0.18 g/L and 0.54 &#177; 0.01 g/g, with the lower carbon emission of 31.08% compared to glucose in the 5 L fermenter. In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into achieving carbon neutrality using renewable substrates for reducing carbon emission in aerobic fermentation systems.</description>

                Abstract The rising concerns about CO 2 levels in the atmosphere and energy dependency on non-renewable sources, such as fossil fuels, could find an integral solution in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. The present work explores two alternatives to the main hindering factors for this reaction, i.e., the reactor configuration and the photocatalyst utilized. A microreactor was designed and 3D printed, providing a cheap and versatile reaction platform. Three bismuth halide perovskites, Cs 3 Bi 2 Cl 9 , Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 , and Cs 4 MnBi 2 Cl 12 , were synthesized and characterized by their band gaps (E g ); Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 presented the lowest E g and was therefore chosen for further evaluation as potential CO 2 -reduction photocatalyst. Aqueous-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was achieved using this perovskite in the microreactor, obtaining CO as a reduction product with maximal production rates of 737 &#956;mol g cat -1 h -1 . The reaction system was evaluated under different flow rates and light intensities. A balance between space-time and reactant feed was found to define the behavior of CO concentration and production in the microreactor. For the light intensity, it was observed that as it increased, both CO production and concentration increased due to generating more electron-hole pairs, favoring the photocatalytic reaction. With these results, Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 perovskite immobilized in the designed microreactor demonstrates having great potential as an effective CO 2 photocatalytic reduction system.&amp;amp;#xD;</description>

                Catalysts involving post&#8208;transition metals have shown almost invincible performance on generating formate in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Conversely, Cu without post&#8208;transition metals have struggled to achieve comparable activity. In this study, a sulfur (S)&#8208;doped&#8208;copper (Cu)&#8208;based catalyst is developed, exhibiting excellent performance in formate generation with a maximum Faradaic efficiency of 92% and a partial current density of 321 mA cm&#8208;2. Ex&#8208;situ structural elucidations reveal the presence of abundant grain boundaries and high retention of S&#8208;S bonds from the covellite phase during CO2RR. Furthermore, thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that S&#8208;S bonds can moderate the binding energies with various intermediates, further improving the activity of the formate pathway. This work is significant in modifying a low&#8208;cost catalyst (Cu) with a non&#8208;metallic substance (S) to achieve comparable performance to mainstream catalysts for formate generation in industrial grade.</description>

                Cu2O shows great potential as a catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR). However, the mechanism behind the formation of different final products from Cu2O nanostructures remains a challenge. In this study, we combine theoretical and experimental approaches to demonstrate that the full-exposed Cu sites in Cu2O (1 0 0) microcubes contribute to superior C2H4 selectivity compared to other microstructures such as Cu2O (1 1 1), (1 1 0), and (3 1 1) facets. Density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations reveal that the stronger orbital splitting between Cu 3d and O 2p orbital of Cu2O (1 0 0) facet facilitates the formation of neighboring and low valence state Cu active site, thereby enhancing *CO adsorption and C2H4 formation. These DFT results are supported by the synthesis of four kinds of Cu2O microparticles (MPs) with different exposed facets, where cubic-Cu2O with the (1 0 0) facet exhibits the highest Faradaic efficiency (61.3 %). This study has significant implications for the structural design and mechanism analysis of innovative catalysts used in ECO2RR.</description>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction is considered a promising solution to mitigate the increasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Despite the promising potential of this process, highly active catalysts are needed to enable its efficient operation. Mixed metal oxide (MMO) materials can promote the formation of a dynamic interface between a metal and its oxidized form under applied potential, resulting in a unique interaction with the reaction intermediates. We synthesized a Pd&#8211;Mo MMO with controlled size and composition and examined the effect of these properties on CO2 electroreduction. Electron microscopy images confirmed the homogeneous distribution of the synthesized Pd7Mo1 on a ZIF-8-derived porous carbon support, with sizes of &#8764;1.3 and 4.5 nm for the samples annealed at 200 and 400 &#176;C, respectively. As shown by density functional theory calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, adding 12.5 % Mo altered the electronic structure of Pd, enhancing CO desorption, and reducing the potential needed for CO production by up to &#8764;0.2 V, corresponding to a &#8764;40 % higher partial CO current density compared to pure Pd. This work demonstrates a facile MMO synthesis enabling particle size and composition control, which will facilitate the development of highly active MMO-derived nanoalloy materials for CO2 electroreduction.</description>

      <title>Nature AND Nurture: Enabling formate-dependent growth in Methanosarcina acetivorans</title>

                Methanogens are essential players in the global carbon cycle. Methanosarcinales possess one of the most diverse metabolic repertoires for methanogenesis, but they have never been observed to utilize formate as a substrate. We successfully reprogrammed the primary metabolism of Methanosarcina acetivorans by introducing an exogenous formate dehydrogenase derived from a closely related species. The engineered strains acquired the capacity to harness energy from formate-dependent methanogenesis pathways, including formate-dependent methyl reduction and formate-dependent carbon dioxide reduction. The ability of M. acetivorans to thrive on formate suggests the existence of essential accessory machinery and metabolic redundancy for generating reduced ferredoxins from F420H2. This remarkable plasticity in energy metabolism raises the possibility that an ancestral lineage of Methanosarcinales may have possessed the capacity to utilize formate. By combining this genetically modified strain with a disruption in methyl disproportionation, we have created a novel tool for investigating and manipulating the components of the F420 reduction and methanogenesis pathways independently.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 RR) is gaining momentum as an effective process to capture and convert CO 2 into valuable chemicals and fuels, as well as to contribute reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Two&#8208;dimensional transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes) are increasingly attracting attention as CO 2 RR electrocatalysts due to their enhanced chemical activity and selectivity, overcoming limitations of traditional metal CO 2 RR electrocatalysts, and likely breaking the scaling relations of reaction intermediates toward the desired product. The present concept reviews the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in the computational description of CO 2 RR on MXenes, going from CO 2 activation on pristine models to different surface terminations, and discuss possible ways to tune the catalytic activity and selectivity, including doping, defects, supported single metal atoms, solvent effects, and electric field effects, while putting in the spotlight prospects by including kinetic aspects.</description>

                Carbon capture and conversion are becoming increasingly important as atmospheric CO2 concentrations rise and their adverse effects become increasingly evident. CO2 conversion/utilization-related research has gained renewed interest on a variety of platforms, including thermal, solar, biological, photochemical, and electrochemical conversions. Electrochemical routes, using suitable catalysts, are potentially suitable for commercial purposes owing to ease of integration with solvent-based carbon capture processes. This paper summarizes and evaluates the studies conducted within the past decade regarding the feasibility of carbon-based supports utilized in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. CO2 conversion has been reviewed in a number of reports, focusing on specific sections, such as metallic/bimetallic catalysts, CO2 solubility, and the fabrication of electrodes and electrochemical cells. The number of publications addressing various carbon-based electrocatalysts is increasing, but these materials have not yet been reviewed. Herein, we are focused on three types of electrocatalyst materials: metals, metal-oxides, non-oxides, and combinations thereof with carbon. The scope of this study includes the following: i) carbon-based materials and how they are characterized by distinctive properties, ii) electrocatalytic CO2 conversion techniques, and iii) research cases for carbon allotrope-supported composites used in CO2 reduction. The advancement in analytical tools that provide insight into liquid-phase reactions will benefit the development of catalysts and electrodes that will be effective in converting CO2 into the desired products. Such developments will also be applicable to other systems involving liquid electrolytes or solvents for performing reactions on catalyst surfaces.</description>

      <title>ATR&#8211;SEIRAS Method to Measure Interfacial pH during Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction on Cu</title>

                This study reports the accuracy and applications of an attenuated total reflectance&#8211;surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8211;SEIRAS) technique to indirectly measure the interfacial pH of the electrolyte using the ratio of phosphate species within 10 nm of the electrocatalyst surface. This technique can be used in situ to study aqueous electrochemical reactions with a calibration range from pH 1&#8211;13, time resolution down to 4 s, and an average 95% confidence interval of 14% that varies depending on the pH region (acidic, neutral, or basic). The method is applied in this study to electrochemical nitrate reduction at a copper cathode to demonstrate its capabilities, but is broadly applicable to any aqueous electrochemical reaction (such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, or oxygen evolution) and the electrocatalyst may be any SEIRAS-active thin film (e.g., silver, gold, or copper). The time-resolved results show a dramatic increase in the interfacial pH from pH 2&#8211;7 in the first minute of operation during both constant current and pulsed current experiments where the bulk pH is unchanged. Attempts to control the pH polarization at the surface by altering the electrochemical operating conditions&#8212;lowering the current or increasing the pulse frequency&#8212;showed no significant change, demonstrating the challenge of controlling the interfacial pH.</description>

      <title>Regulating CHO* intermediate pathway towards the significant acceleration of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 through rGO-coated ultrafine Pd nanoparticles</title>

                Tailoring catalytic reaction pathways by using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to tune the electron-hole separation channels in the active sites of noble metals for achieving ideal yield and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction of hydrocarbon fuels remains a challenge. Herein, ternary catalyst of rGO-coated SnO2-supported noble metal Pd nanoparticles (Pd4/SnO2@rGO) has been prepared by coassembly between negatively charged graphene oxide and positively charged Pd nanoparticles. By coating with ultrathin rGO, the selectivity can be shifted from CO (44.69 % for Pd4/SnO2) toward CH4 as the prevalent species, in which the Pd nanoparticles acted as catalytic sites and electron capture sites. The rGO coating reduced the recombination of the photogenerated carriers as well as optimized the band gap and reduction potential of the catalyst. The in situ spectroscopic tests and density functional theory calculations revealed that CO2 adsorbed on Pd nanoparticles selectively formed dominant low-energy CHO* intermediates because of the generation of HCOOH* intermediates, thus providing a unique reaction pathway for the reduction of CO2 to CH4. Therefore, under sunlight irradiation, the CH4 selectivity of the catalyst is enhanced to 94.1 % with a production rate of up to 77.8 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1. This work demonstrated the prospect to tune the electronic structure of Pd using rGO, which provided a strategy for enhancing the carbon dioxide reduction reaction and selectively obtaining CH4 products in photocatalytic systems.</description>

                Abstract Single&#8208;atom catalysts possess great potential for applications in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions. Recently, the fast and low&#8208;cost preparation of highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts remains a challenge. Herein, a high&#8208;density current generated by pulsed discharge is employed for the formation of graphene aerogel anchored Cu single atom catalysts perfectly. The Cu atoms decomposed by Cu(NO 3 ) 2 &#8226;xH 2 O are fixed on graphene under the local transient high temperature and intense electromagnetic field. The activity and selectivity of formic acid are correlated with the coordinatively unsaturated Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 moieties, reaching an optimal Faradaic efficiency (93.7%) at &#8722;0.9 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In situ characterizations reveal that the asymmetric Cu&#9472;N/O structure in a pinched state displays better catalytic activity in CO 2 RR. Density functional theory results indicate that the Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 sites regulate the adsorption configuration of intermediates and lower the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of * OCHO species, thereby promoting CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion.</description>

                CO2 geological storage is the primary means of achieving large-scale, low-cost carbon dioxide reduction. Compared with onshore basins, sequestration in offshore basins has the advantages of larger storage volume and less impact on people and the environment. At the same time, there are also challenges such as high cost and technical difficulty for sequestration. At present, there are many researches on the selection and suitability evaluation of CCS in China, and there are also very successful demonstration applications, while the research on CO2 geological storage in sea areas is relatively few. Taking Zhuyi Depression of Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South China Sea as an example in this paper, with the goal of meeting the storage capacity of one million tons per year. Making statistics on the factors affecting the suitability of CO2 storage of oil and gas-bearing structures in the depression from three aspects: geological characteristics, storage economy and storage safety, and constructs a screening index system of CO2 geological storage field, which includes 3 levels and 18 evaluation factors. The index weight of each evaluation factor is calculated by AHP. The suitability of CO2 sealing of selected oil and gas-bearing structures is quantitatively evaluated by multi-source information overlap analysis. The results show that the Xijiang 23 and other oil-bearing structures in the west of Huizhou Sag have priority as the storage field. The results of this study can provide reference for the implementation and management decision of CO2 saline aquifers storage in this area.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction by borophene supported bimetallic catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.01.051</link>
      <description>Meiling Liu, Jayaraman Balamurugan, Tongxiang Liang, Chao Liu, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390766525

                Bimetal atom catalysts (BACs) hold significant potential for various applications as a result of the synergistic interaction between adjacent metal atoms. This interaction leads to improved catalytic performance, while simultaneously maintaining high atomic efficiency and exceptional selectivity, similar to single atom catalysts (SACs). Bimetallic site catalysts (M2&#946;12) supported by &#946;12-borophene were developed as catalysts for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). The research on density functional theory (DFT) demonstrates that M2&#946;12 exhibits exceptional stability, conductivity, and catalytic activity. Investigating the most efficient reaction pathway for CO2RR by analyzing the Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) during potential determining steps (PDS) and choosing a catalyst with outstanding catalytic performance for CO2RR. The overpotential required for Fe2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 to generate CO is merely 0.05 V. This implies that the conversion of CO2 to CO can be accomplished with minimal additional voltage. The overpotential values for Cu2&#946;12 and Ag2&#946;12 during the formation of HCOOH were merely 0.001 and 0.07 V, respectively. Furthermore, the Rh2&#946;12 catalyst exhibits a relatively low overpotential of 0.51 V for CH3OH and 0.65 V for CH4. The Fe2&#946;12 produces C2H4 through the *CO-*CO pathway, while Ag2&#946;12 generates CH3CH2OH via the *CO-*CHO coupling pathway, with remarkably low overpotentials of 0.84 and 0.60 V, respectively. The study provides valuable insights for the systematic design and screening of electrocatalysts for CO2RR that exhibit exceptional catalytic performance and selectivity.</description>

      <title>CARBON TAX AND ITS EFFECT ON THE ECONOMY, TAXES AND ENVIRONMENT</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.56301/awl.v6i1.1013</link>
      <description>M.E. Retno Kadarukmi, Awang Long Law Review. 6(1)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4390652284

                This research discusses theoretically the relationship between carbon tax with economy, tax and environment. This research is a legal research with analytical descriptive nature, namely research that analyzes secondary data on issues related to carbon taxes as an instrument for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. According to secondary data, this research is aimed at discovering aspects of carbon tax design, collection of carbon taxes, and state management of carbon tax revenues. Carbon taxes are an effective and efficient instrument to support the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. To be implemented, a carbon tax must be feasible. Eligibility requires public acceptance. On the other hand, a carbon tax can create a lot of controversy. The main argument against carbon taxes is that carbon taxes do not always guarantee emission reductions. In addition, there are also concerns over the unintended effects of competitiveness, carbon leakage, and fears of unintended distributional impacts, which could be barriers to implementation.</description>

                China&#8217;s transition to a green, low-carbon economy is among the most essential elements needed to achieve the climate goals set down in the Paris Agreement. China has pledged it &#8220;will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060&#8221;.1 Given the currently high emissions level in China and an economic structure with significant share of industrial sector and fossil fuel consumption, it remains a formidable challenge to realize such steep emission reduction for the 30-60 goals, as we call them in this paper.</description>

      <title>Mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; Benefits from Superelevated CO2 While Adapting to Far-red Light Over Time</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21273/hortsci17522-23</link>
      <description>Emily J. Kennebeck, Qingguo Meng, Hortscience. 59(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390628599

                Compared with the ambient Earth carbon dioxide concentration (&#8776;415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), the International Space Station has superelevated carbon dioxide (&#8776;2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), which can be a stressor to certain crops. Far-red light can drive plant photosynthesis and increase extension growth and biomass. However, the effects of far-red light under superelevated carbon dioxide are unclear. We grew hydroponic mustard ( Brassica carinata ) &#8216;Amara&#8217; seedlings in four growth chambers using a randomized complete block design with two carbon dioxide concentrations (415 and 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), two lighting treatments, and two blocks at temperature and relative humidity set points of 22 &#176;C and 40%, respectively. Each growth chamber had two lighting treatments at the same total photon flux density of 200 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 . Under the same blue and green light at 50 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 each, plants received either red light at 100 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 or red + far-red light at 50 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 each. At day 15 after planting, far-red light did not influence shoot fresh or dry mass at 415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide, but decreased both parameters by 22% to 23% at 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration increased shoot fresh and dry mass 27% to 49%, regardless of the lighting treatment. Far-red light decreased leaf area by 16% at 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide, but had no effect at 415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration increased leaf area by 21% to 33%, regardless of far-red light. Regardless of the carbon dioxide concentration, far-red light promoted stem elongation and decreased chlorophyll concentrations by 39% to 42%. These responses indicate far-red light elicited a crop-specific shade avoidance response in mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217;, increasing extension growth but decreasing leaf area, thereby reducing light interception and biomass. In addition, carbon dioxide enrichment up to 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 increased the biomass of mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; but decreased the biomass of other crops, indicating crop-specific tolerance to superelevated carbon dioxide. In conclusion, mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; seedlings benefit from superelevated carbon dioxide, but exhibit growth reduction under far-red light under superelevated carbon dioxide.</description>

      <title>Influence of tillage methods on carbon dioxide emissions in spring wheat crops</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/20248206006</link>
      <description>Evgeniy Demin, Stanislav Miller, Kirill Likhanov, BIO web of conferences. 82(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4390539980

                The agriculture intensification is associated with an increase in anthropogenic load on arable soils. Tillage leads to disruption of the natural process of soil formation in connection with which the soil biota activity changes and the carbon cycle is disrupted. The purpose of the study is to establish the effects of the tillage method on the carbon dioxide emission in spring wheat crops. The emission of carbon dioxide during the growing season of spring wheat varies significantly depending on the soil processing method and temperature. At the beginning of spring wheat development, the daily emission of carbon dioxide during the dump and subsurface tillage method does not exceed 36.0 and 36.2 CO 2 kg/ha using zero technology provides a reduction in production CO 2 production to 27.8 kg/ha*day. With an increase in soil temperature by July 24, the daily emission increases on a dump and subsurface background to 105.5 and 106.0 CO 2 kg/ha*day, on a zero background to 95.4 CO 2 kg/ha*day. In the future, it decreases. The total carbon losses during the dump and subsurface tillage methods are 2829 and 2793 kg/ha, the use of zero tillage technology reduces carbon losses in grain agrocenosis by 18%.</description>

      <title>Solar Water Heating: Comprehensive Review, Critical Analysis and Case Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.52843/cassyni.z0lx6v</link>
      <description>Amal Herez, No host. None(None)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4390616016

                The increasing global demand for renewable energy sources underscores the significance of Solar Water Heating Systems (SWHS), emphasizing the need for thorough research and analysis in this domain. SWHS play a pivotal role in addressing energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, making it imperative to conduct in-depth studies on their utilization. Hence, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of SWHS. It starts by explaining the principles behind these systems, including their components and classification. Moreover, this review consolidates various studies that have been conducted on SWHS to highlight both their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, a case study is conducted in which it takes into consideration important economic and environmental factors. In particular, it focuses on several scenarios present in Lebanon such as family homes, schools, restaurants hotels and gyms to estimate potential cost savings achieved through implementing SWHS as opposed to relying solely on electric heaters. Furthermore, this investigation also examines the corresponding payback period associated with adopting SWHS along with assessing the significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions possible if these systems were widely implemented. The findings of the study demonstrate that there is a direct correlation between the extent to which SWHS are utilized and both the payback period and reduction in CO2 emissions. It was observed that when SWHS are used more frequently, with a high percentage of time (Pr=0.9), significant advantages can be achieved. For instance, for different types of establishments such as family homes, schools, restaurants, hotels, and gyms, it was estimated that average payback periods would be 14.2 years, 4.6 years, 9.2 years, 4.4 years, and 5.3 years, respectively. These results indicate that adopting a greater dependency on SWHSs not only leads to quicker cost recovery but also significantly contributes towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The analysis reveals that the yearly decrease in carbon dioxide emissions per individual is 0.16 t within a household, 0.016 t per student in an educational institution, 0.04 t per customer within a dining establishment, 0.37 t for each occupied bed in a hotel accommodation, and 0.11 t per individual at a gym. This paper serves as guidelines to SWH community. Additionally, it adds a practical insights into economic and environmental issues relevant to both Lebanon and countries with similar climates.</description>

                The coal-based energy consumption structure has led to high coal consumption and carbon emissions in China's iron and steel industry, and the task of coal saving and carbon reduction in the steel industry is difficult and urgent. The economic viability of various coal-saving and emission-reduction technologies, the extent of their coal-saving and emission-reduction potential, and the guidance on the adoption of advanced technologies are crucial issues that need to be addressed in the Chinese steel industry. This article employs the Energy-Production (E-P) analysis method and the Conservation Supply Curve (CSC) model incorporating coal consumption ratio coefficients to systematically analyze coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the overall iron and steel industry and its sub-processes under different scenarios. It calculates the coal-saving emission reduction costs of 32 technologies, evaluates them comprehensively based on their coal-saving and emission-reduction potentials and cost-effectiveness, and categorizes them accordingly. According to the cost of coal saving and emission reduction as the demarcation point, a total of 19 technologies are cost-effective; according to the coal-saving emission reduction potential and cost division, 32 technologies are divided into 6 categories, among which 6 technologies such as sintering waste heat recovery technology can be used as key technologies for popularization and application. Seven technologies, such as efficient preheating technology of ladle, have high cost and low potential, which can be gradually eliminated or improved and upgraded. After the comprehensive promotion of the 32 technologies, the maximum coal saving potential is about 3.453 billion GJ, the CO2 emission reduction potential is 395 million tons, the total coal consumption of the steel industry can be reduced to about 13.904 billion GJ, and the carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced to 1.179 billion tons.</description>

                The development of floating photovoltaic systems in Romania can help to the share of more than 30.7 % of the total energy produced from renewable energy sources set for the year 2030. Floating photovoltaic plants ensure the achievement of overall energy targets without affecting biodiversity and/or agricultural crops. This study evaluates the insolation and the possibility of installing this technology on Lake F&#259;c&#259;u, Romania, to benefit from the generation of electricity but also better water quality and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$. The obtained results are promising as Floating photovoltaic plants covering around 0.22 % of the lake surface, provide 26.76 $M W h /$ year and the estimated reduction of CO &lt;inf xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt; emission is 7.52 $\mathbf{t C O}_{2 \mathrm{eq}} /$ year.</description>

                Abstract Carbon dioxide conversion into valuable products using photocatalysis and electrocatalysis is an effective approach to mitigate global environmental issues and the energy shortages. Among the materials utilized for catalytic reduction of CO 2 , Cu-based materials are highly advantageous owing to their widespread availability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, Cu-based materials demonstrate interesting abilities in the adsorption and activation of carbon dioxide, allowing the formation of C 2+ compounds through C&#8211;C coupling process. Herein, the basic principles of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions (PCO 2 RR) and electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (ECO 2 RR) and the pathways for the generation C 2+ products are introduced. This review categorizes Cu-based materials into different groups including Cu metal, Cu oxides, Cu alloys, and Cu SACs, Cu heterojunctions based on their catalytic applications. The relationship between the Cu surfaces and their efficiency in both PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR is emphasized. Through a review of recent studies on PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR using Cu-based catalysts, the focus is on understanding the underlying reasons for the enhanced selectivity toward C 2+ products. Finally, the opportunities and challenges associated with Cu-based materials in the CO 2 catalytic reduction applications are presented, along with research directions that can guide for the design of highly active and selective Cu-based materials for CO 2 reduction processes in the future.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Potential Carbon Dioxide Utilization Pathways in Uzbekistan</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/asec2023-15503</link>

                Reaching net-zero emissions by the middle of this century requires the implementation of massive carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction strategies along with the reduction of other greenhouse gases on both global and country scales. Thus, carbon capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU) is a promising technology in combination with renewable energy transition. Currently, CO2 utilization has attracted much attention from the scientific community worldwide, since it can improve the economic viability of CCSU deployment by creating a market for the recovered CO2 stream. In this study, a brief assessment and comparison of potential CO2 utilization pathways in Uzbekistan, including CO2-to-chemical/fuel conversion, CO2 bio-fixation/mineralization, and the direct use of CO2, such as for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery (EHR), are conducted considering the CO2 stationary sources and site-specific conditions of the country. In addition, possible challenges and opportunities for large-scale CO2 utilization routes are also discussed. According to this assessment, there is great potential for the direct use of CO2 as a process-boosting agent for EHR in more than 22 major natural gas, crude oil, and coal reservoirs. Moreover, methanol and urea production processes can also create huge market demand for recovered CO2 as long as the conventional CO2 production processes are replaced by sustainable ones.</description>

      <title>Economic and emissions analysis of behind-the-meter energy storage with rooftop solar: a case study for Indian residential consumers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1049/icp.2023.3106</link>

                The global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels continue to rise, driven by rising energy use. Rooftop photovoltaic (RTPV) systems are an effective way to reduce emissions and, consequently, the carbon footprint for residential consumers. The use of behind-the-meter (BTM) energy storage with RTPV is a flexible and dependable method for generating electricity as it provides power to the customer even if there is an outage from the utility grid. It also reduces reliance on the utility through savings in the electricity bill and reducing CO2 emissions. In this paper, we analyse the economics and emissions along with the sizing of BTM battery storage co-located with RTPV for residential customers in India. Based on the power flow interactions between RTPV, grid, and battery storage, a techno-economic framework is built to compute the system&amp;apos;s life cycle costing. The life cycle cost of energy for BTM battery storage with RTPV to meet a 14-kWh energy demand is INR 11/kWh. We observe a 75% decrease in utility costs and a 58% reduction in CO2 emissions for the same system. The findings of this study can help policymakers, utilities, and homeowners make informed decisions regarding the adoption and integration of energy storage systems with residential solar PV installations.</description>

                Abstract Carbon budgets are quantifications of the total amount of carbon dioxide that can ever be emitted while keeping global warming below specific temperature limits. However, estimates of these budgets for limiting warming to 1.5 &#176;C and well-below 2 &#176;C include assumptions about how much warming can be expected from non-CO 2 emissions. Here, we uncover the non-CO 2 emissions assumptions that underlie the latest remaining carbon budget estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and quantify the implication of the world pursuing alternative higher or lower emissions. We consider contributions of methane, nitrous oxide, fluorinated gases, and aerosols and show how pursuing inadequate methane emission reductions causes remaining carbon budgets compatible with the Paris Agreement temperature limits to be exhausted today, effectively putting achievement of the Paris Agreement out of reach.</description>

                Reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the aerobic biorefinery system is becoming a crucial effort for achieving carbon-economic biosynthesis of biomaterials and chemicals. Poly-2-hydrobutanedioic acid (P2HBD), a long-carbon chain polyester produced by the fungus Aureobasidium pullulans, has garnered significant attention in the biomaterials and chemical industries. In this study, we designed a CO2 emission reduction system using nonfermentable substrates to enable efficient biosynthesis of P2HBD. Based on the genome-scale model iZX637 of A. pullulans, glycerol and ethanol were stimulated to show the potential advantages over glucose in terms of reduced CO2 emission. Additionally, we employed an NADH/NAD+ fluorescent probe called SoNar to dynamically monitor the reductive power ratio during CO2 emission. Subsequently, glycerol metabolism and rTCA carbon fixation pathway were engineered, while implementing a modular assembly strategy to achieve balanced integration between these two modules through precise promoter engineering regulation. The optimal strain ZX-LM03 showed the advantages of less carbon emission with glycerol and ethanol as the co-substrates, and achieved the higher P2HBD titer and yield of 15.07 &#177; 0.18 g/L and 0.54 &#177; 0.01 g/g, with the lower carbon emission of 31.08% compared to glucose in the 5 L fermenter. In conclusion, this study provides novel insights into achieving carbon neutrality using renewable substrates for reducing carbon emission in aerobic fermentation systems.</description>
