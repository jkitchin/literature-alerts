                &lt;p&gt;Inorganic, organic, and hybrid two-dimensional (2D) materials are being developed for ever-expanding numbers of applications, though energy and catalysis remain the main drivers of their development. We present overviews of bottom-up and top-down synthetic strategies of such materials and examine manufacturing scalability issues. Mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties and their modulation are highlighted because they are fundamental to the above-mentioned drivers. The burgeoning importance of heterostructures in such materials, particularly for catalysis and electrode design and function is stressed. Detailed attention is given to applications of 2D materials to the electrocatalysis reactions: oxygen reduction, oxygen evolution, hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction. Water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction by photocatalysis are also examined. A perspective of expected advances in the expansion of applications and types of 2D materials, with a focus on heterostructure development, is presented in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The role of organic cations in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in aprotic solvents</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-wl1bg</link>
      <description>James McGregor, Jay T. Bender, Amanda Petersen, Louise M. Ca&#241;ada, Jan Rossmeisl, Joan F. Brennecke, Joaquin Resasco, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392917891

                The electrochemical reduction of CO2 is sensitive to the microenvironment surrounding catalytic active sites. Although the impact of changing electrolyte composition on CO2 reduction kinetics in aqueous electrolytes has been studied intensively, less is known about the influence of the electrochemical environment in non-aqueous solvents. Here, we present data demonstrating that organic alkyl ammonium cations influence catalytic performance in non-aqueous media and describe a physical model that rationalizes these observations. Using results from a combination of kinetic, spectroscopic, and computational techniques, we argue that the interfacial electric field present at the catalyst surface is sensitive to the molecular identity of the organic cation in the aprotic electrolyte. This is true irrespective of solvent, electrolyte ionic strength, or the supporting electrolyte counter anion. Our results suggest that changes in the interfacial field can be attributed to differences in the cation-electrode distance. Changes in the electric field strength are consequential to CO2R to CO as they modify the energetics of the kinetically relevant CO2 activation step.</description>

                Abstract Precisely designing asymmetrical structure is an efficient strategy to optimize the performance of metallic catalysts for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions. Herein, a transient high-density current induced by pulsed discharge is used to rapidly construct graphene aerogel (GAs) supported asymmetric Cu cluster catalysts. Cu atoms decomposed by CuCl 2 are converged on graphene surfaces in GAs together with oxygen originating from the intense current and instantaneous high temperature. The atomic and electronic structures of Cu nanoclusters exhibit asymmetric distribution due to lattice distortion and O-doping in Cu crystals. Typically, in CO 2 reduction reactions, the selectivity and activity of ethanol are related to the asymmetric structure and strong interfacial interaction of Cu-O/C moieties, exhibiting an ideal Faradaic efficiency (ethanol 75.3% and C 2+ products 90.5%) at -1.1 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Meanwhile, the benefit of the strong interaction between Cu nanoclusters and GA supports, the catalyst exhibits long-term stability. In situ XAFS reveals that the Cu 4 -Cu/C 2 O 1 interaction displays the effective active sites in CO 2 RR. The pathways of corresponding products and the reaction mechanism on Cu 4 -Cu/C 2 O 1 moieties are revealed through the in situ attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and the calculation of density functional theory. This work gives a new solution to solve the challenge for balancing the activity and stability of asymmetric-structure catalysts toward energy conversion reactions.</description>

                The membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEAs) electrolyzers are the most attractive systems for the electrolytic conversion of CO2 into commodity chemicals and fuels at commercially relevant current densities. Suppressing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is vital to the highly efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). However, little attention has been paid to the HER. Herein, polybenzimidazole (PBI) Janus membranes with significant hydrophobic/hydrophilic asymmetric surface wettability were constructed for regulating the HER in CO2RR. The HER was modulated by adjusting the microstructure and surface hydrophobicity of the membrane as well as the CO2 feeding method. The p-PBI-HCF MEA showed a significant suppression of HER and a 6-fold improvement in CO selectivity over p-PBI MEA. The p-PBI-HCF exhibited superior CO2RR performance in MEA compared to commercial membranes (FAA-3-50 and Nafion115). At 2.0&#8211;3.0 V, the CO Faraday efficiency (FECO) of the p-PBI-HCF MEA electrolyzer remained above 92%. The optimal energy efficiency range was between 2.0 and 2.4 V when the FECO was close to 100%. The p-PBI-HCF provided 92% FECO and a current density of 225 mA cm&#8722;2 at 3 V. This work provides guidelines for the development of viable PBI membranes and MEAs for CO2RR.</description>

                Converting carbon dioxide (CO2) into valuable chemicals such as fossil resources via photocatalysis requires the development of advanced materials. Herein, we coupled zirconium-based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) containing porphyrin and Cu-porphyrin with anatase TiO2. The effect of the porphyrin metalation proportion was also investigated. Notably, while the use of free-base porphyrin as the organic linker resulted in the development of PCN-224, the presence of Cu-porphyrin provided mixed-phase MOF structures containing both PCN-224 and PCN-222. MOF/TiO2 composites bearing partial (50%) metalated porphyrin were proven more active and selective towards the production of CH4, at ambient conditions, in the gas phase and using water vapors without the use of hole scavengers. The optimized composite bearing 15 wt.% of the partial metalated MOF was three times more active than pure TiO2 towards CH4 production. This study provides insights on the effect of precise materials engineering at a molecular level on the development of advanced MOF-based photocatalysts for CO2 reduction.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Each Component Ratio of Multiple Thermal Fluids in Extra-Heavy Oil Reservoir</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-97-0260-2_78</link>

                Under the goal of "carbon peaking and carbon neutrality", the technology of multiple thermal fluids is widely used to develop heavy oil reservoirs at home and abroad for its advantages of low carbon and environmental protection. The multicomponent thermal fluids mainly contain nitrogen, carbon dioxide and steam. In the formation, multi-components play an important role in the huff and puff effect. In order to improve the development effect of extra-heavy oil reservoir, the optimization of each component ratio must be further studied. Based on the single factor analysis method and orthogonal test method, this paper designs 40 groups of multi-component thermal fluids numerical simulation schemes with different component proportions. CMG software simulates the influence of steam injection rate, gas-steam ratio, CO2-N2 ratio and other injection parameters on the development effect of multi-component thermal fluids. The results show that the ratio of CO2 to N2 is the significant factor affecting the huff and puff effect, and the sensitivity order is CO2 to N2 ratio, gas-steam ratio and steam injection rate. The optimal injection parameter combination is as follows: the steam injection rate is 200 t/d, the gas-steam ratio is 300 m3/t, and the ratio of CO2 to N2 is 70%:30%. Viscosity deduction of muti-component thermal fluids has two regions: high temperature viscosity reduction and CO2 dissolution viscosity reduction region. The results of this study have theoretical guiding significance for the optimization of injection-production parameters of multiple thermal fluids huff and puff, and can be further applied to field practice.</description>
