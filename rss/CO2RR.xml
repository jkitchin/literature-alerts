                We developed a new electrocatalysts for hybrid homogeneous / heterogeneous conversion of CO2 in water. A Molybdenum-based organometallic compound has been linked by covalent C-C bond to a carbon-cloth electrode surface. This technique allows using the Mo catalyst in water, a solvent in which the catalyst is not soluble, for the direct electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 to methanol. Although the system displays moderate current density (1&#247;4 mA/cm2), the very high faradaic efficiency of the CO2-to-methanol conversion (65%), the good selectivity (H2 is the only other reduction product), the simply experimental setup and the potential industrial scale-up of the technique makes this approach of great interest. Chronoamperometric measurement carried in water for 21 hours show a stable and constant catalytic performance with no other carbon-reduced products. Spectroelectrochemistry and detailed DFT calculations shed light on the catalytic process, which consists of six protons coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps. We propose the catalytic cycle that converts CO to methanol in which the first step is a PCET localized on the CO coordinated to the metal.</description>

                Abstract In this study, a cross&#8208;linked boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) photocatalyst containing a carbazole donor group designed for photoelectrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction is synthesized and characterized. The BODIPY&#8208;based system, coated onto a platinum surface, is evaluated for its electrochemical and photocatalytic performance under light illumination. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry measurements reveals enhanced photocurrent responses, confirming the catalyst's ability to effectively drive CO 2 reduction. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC&#8208;MS) analysis identifies the formation of ethanol (C 2 H 5 OH) as a major reaction product, showing that its yield increased with extended reaction times. Additionally, the photocatalyst demonstrates remarkable performance with significantly increasing turnover numbers (TON) and turnover frequencies (TOF) over time, indicating stable and sustained catalytic activity. With a Faradaic efficiency of 34.79% at a potential of &#8208;1.15 V, this BODIPY system exhibits both high activity and long&#8208;term stability. The combination of efficient electron transfer and visible light absorption by the carbazole&#8208;BODIPY donor&#8208;acceptor structure positions this system as a highly promising candidate for sustainable CO 2 conversion applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the performance of electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction towards C1 products</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.63028/10067/2101340151162165141</link>
      <description>J&#228;ri Van den Hoek, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404724057

                The Industrial Revolution led to significant socio-economic growth and population expansion, yet its environmental consequences have been profound, notably through the increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2). This imbalance in the carbon cycle contributes to global warming, melting ice caps, biodiversity loss, and extreme weather events. To combat this, international and European authorities aim for carbon neutrality by 2050. Achieving this requires innovative technologies to limit global temperature rise to below 2C above pre-industrial levels. One promising solution is the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (eCO2R), a carbon dioxide utilization technology that reduces atmospheric CO2 and closes the carbon cycle by converting it into valuable chemicals using renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal power. Two key products of eCO2R, carbon monoxide and formate, are of particular interest due to their industrial relevance, high market value, and low energy requirements. This dissertation explores the electroreduction of CO2 as a critical solution to mitigate climate change. It delves into the interplay between electrocatalyst performance and interface properties to improve the selectivity, activity, and stability of electrocatalysts used for producing C1 products. The research highlights the challenges faced by current electrocatalysts and suggests ways to enhance their performance. In the context of CO production, the dissertation investigates the limitations of silver (Ag) nanoparticle stability, addressing issues of agglomeration and detachment. The study proposes a nanoparticle confinement strategy to stabilize Ag nanoparticles within nitrogen-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (NOMC). This method significantly reduces instability and improves Faradaic efficiency (FE) towards CO production (&gt;80% at 100 mA cm-2). For formate production, the research focuses on chalcogenide-based electrocatalysts, specifically SnS2 thin films fabricated using atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques. The study examines the impact of morphology on the electrocatalytic interface and its role in the triple-phase boundary (TPB). Although these SnS2 electrocatalysts exhibit high formate FE (~80%), their long-term stability is limited by the reduction of SnS2 to Sn and morphological degradation. Further investigation into the effect of substrate modifications via ALD reveals that thermal deposition of In2S3 electrocatalysts leads to superior formate selectivity (&gt;90%) and stability compared to plasma-enhanced versions. These findings emphasize the importance of interface properties, such as roughness and wettability, in enhancing electrocatalyst performance. The research provides valuable insights for optimizing electrocatalysts for industrial applications, improving their stability, activity, and selectivity.</description>

      <title>Reaction Pathways for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction into Ethanol</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-zmdtq</link>
      <description>Peshala Jayamaha, Lichang Wang, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404779659

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising route to storing chemical energy and producing valuable chemicals, while also contributing to carbon cycle closure. Despite significant advances in electrocatalytic CO2RR for multi-carbon products, challenges remain in optimizing catalysts for high selectivity and efficiency. Cu-based heterogeneous catalysts are among the most promising options; however, enhancing their catalytic efficiency and product selectivity remains complex due to several factors. One key challenge is that product selectivity heavily depends on the catalyst&#8217;s surface morphology, which impacts both Faradaic efficiency and overpotential requirements for target product formation. Additionally, the reaction pathways and intermediates for multi-carbon products are not yet fully understood, complicating efforts to achieve consistent multi-carbon yields. Variability introduced by the electrolyte environment, applied potential, and operating conditions further impacts selectivity and efficiency. This review aims to address these challenges by exploring the interplay between the surface structure of Cu-based catalysts and system parameters that shape reaction pathways for ethanol formation. Notably, we explore alternative pathways beyond the conventional mechanisms involving CHO, COH, and CO dimers.</description>

      <title>In&#8208;situ CeO2/CuO heterojunction electrocatalyst for CO2 reduction to ethylene</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cphc.202400838</link>

                CeO2/CuO heterojunction composite catalysts were synthesized using a one&#8208;step method, achieving the introduction of Ce species on nanoscale copper oxide (CuO) particles during the hydrothermal process. On one hand, this protects the nanostructure of the substrate from damage and prevents the agglomeration of CuO nanoparticles. On the other hand, the bimetallic synergistic effect between Ce and Cu effectively improves the conductivity and catalytic activity of the catalyst, significantly enhancing the selectivity of the catalyst for electrochemical reduction of CO2 to C2H4, while effectively suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). By regulating the amount of CeO2 introducing, a series of CeO2/CuO composite catalysts were designed. The results showed that the 15% CeO2/CuO catalyst exhibited the best selectivity and catalytic activity for C2H4. At a low overpotential of &#8722;1.2 V, the 15% CeO2/CuO catalyst demonstrated a current density of 14.2 mA cm&#8315;&#178; and achieved a Faradaic efficiency for ethylene as high as 65.78%, which is 2.85 times the current density (j = 4.98 mA cm&#8315;&#178;) and 3.27 times the Faradaic efficiency for ethylene (FEC2H4 = 20.13%) of the undoped catalyst at the same potential. This work provides a feasible basis for achieving efficient CO2RR to C2 products, and even multi&#8208;carbon products.</description>

                The electrochemical conversion of low&#8208;concentration CO2 feedstock to value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels is a promising pathway for achieving direct valorization of waste gas streams. However, this is challenging due to significant competition from the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and lowered CO2 reduction (CO2R) kinetics as compared to systems that employ pure CO2. Here we show that terephthalic acid (TPA) functionalization can boost selectivity towards CO2R and suppress HER over a range of catalysts including Bi, Cu and Zn. For instance, TPA functionalized Bi attained a formate Faradaic efficiency (FEHCOO&#8208;) of 96.3% at 300 mA cm&#8208;2 with pure CO2 feedstock. Density functional theory simulations indicate that this is because TPA functionalization modulates the binding energies of the key reaction intermediates *OCHO and *H. With low&#8208;concentration feedstock (15% CO2) at 100 mA cm&#8208;2, we achieved a high FEHCOO&#8208; of 85.8%, which was double that of an unmodified Bi catalyst. Using an electrolyzer with a porous solid electrolyte layer, we successfully showcase 30 h of continuous high&#8208;purity formic acid production from dilute CO2. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that molecular tuning of a catalyst can be an effective strategy for enabling selective CO2R using low&#8208;concentration feedstock.</description>

                The iron and steel industry, a major energy consumer, faces significant pressure to reduce CO2 emissions. As the world&#8217;s largest steel producer, China must prioritize this sector to meet its carbon neutrality goals. This study provides a comprehensive review of various carbon reduction technologies to drive decarbonization in the steel industry. China&#8217;s iron and steel sector, which accounted for approximately 15% of the country&#8217;s total CO2 emissions in 2022, predominantly relies on coke and coal combustion. This study provides a comprehensive review of a variety of carbon reduction technologies to advance decarbonization in the iron and steel industry. This study categorizes carbon reduction technologies in the steel sector into low-carbon, zero-carbon, and negative-carbon technologies. Low-carbon technologies, which are the most widely implemented, are further divided into energy structure adjustment, material structure adjustment, energy efficiency improvement technologies, etc. This study specifically reviews dry quenching technology, high-scale pellet technology for blast furnace, and top pressure recovery turbine power generation technology. As a zero-carbon technology, hydrometallurgy is a central focus of this study and a key area of research within China&#8217;s iron and steel industry. While negative-carbon technologies are primarily centered around carbon capture, utilization technologies are still in early stages. By presenting the latest advancements, this study offers valuable insights and guidance to facilitate the iron and steel industry&#8217;s transition to a low-carbon future, crucial for mitigating global climate change.</description>

                In response to growing concerns about the greenhouse effect, the direct conversion of atmospheric CO2 has become a pivotal research focus. This research utilizes hydrothermal synthesis to develop Bi2WO6/MXene(Ti3C2Tx), which efficiently reduces CO2 directly at the gas&#8211;solid interface through photothermal synergy, without requiring additional sacrificial agents or alkaline absorption solutions. The results indicate that the CO formation rate is about 216.9 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1h&#8722;1. Notably, this system demonstrates exceptional selectivity for reducing CO2 to CO. The outstanding photothermal catalytic efficiency is attributed to the introduction of MXene, which serves as an efficient and economical co-catalyst. The integration of MXene improves the composite material&#8217;s specific surface area and pore structure, enhances its CO2 adsorption capacity, and results in the Bi2WO6/MXene hybrid having a shorter charge transfer distance and a larger interface contact area. This ensures superior charge transfer capabilities, ultimately leading to a significant enhancement in the catalytic efficiency of the composite. This study presents a straightforward and highly selective method for capturing and converting atmospheric CO2, offering fresh insights for developing efficient photothermal catalytic materials.</description>

      <title>Assessing CO2 Reduction Effects Through Decarbonization Scenarios in the Residential and Transportation Sectors: Challenges and Solutions for Japan&#8217;s Hilly and Mountainous Areas</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su162310342</link>
      <description>Xiying Hao, Chuyue Yan, Daisuke NARUMI, Sustainability. 16(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404716793

                Depopulation, aging, and regional decline are becoming increasingly serious issues in Japan&#8217;s hilly and mountainous areas. Focusing on mitigating environmental damage and envisioning a sustainable future for these regions, this study examines the potential for reducing CO2 emissions in the residential and transportation sectors by 2050. Bottom-up simulations were used to estimate CO2 emissions. Subsequently, six decarbonization scenarios were formulated, considering various measures from the perspectives of population distribution and technological progress. Based on these scenarios, this study analyzes changes in future population, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions by 2050. The results of this study show the following. (1) Depopulation and aging problems in these regions are expected to become more severe in the future. It is necessary to take action to promote sustainable regional development. (2) Pursuing decarbonization has a positive impact on enhancing regional sustainability; however, maintaining the intensity of measures at the current level could lead to a reduction of only 40% in CO2 emissions per capita by 2050 compared with 2020. (3) Scenarios that strengthen decarbonization measures could achieve a reduction of over 95% by 2050, indicating that carbon neutrality is attainable. However, this will require implementing measures at a higher intensity, especially in the transportation sector.</description>

      <title>Iron sulfide-catalyzed gaseous CO2 reduction and prebiotic carbon fixation in terrestrial hot springs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54062-y</link>
      <description>Jingbo Nan, Shunqin Luo, Quoc Phuong Tran, Albert C. Fahrenbach, Wenning Lu, Yingjie Hu, Zongjun Yin, Jinhua Ye, Martin J. Van Kranendonk, Nature Communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404824735

                Abstract Understanding abiotic carbon fixation provides insights into early Earth&#8217;s carbon cycles and life&#8217;s emergence in terrestrial hot springs, where iron sulfide (FeS), similar to cofactors in metabolic enzymes, may catalyze prebiotic synthesis. However, the role of FeS-mediated carbon fixation in such conditions remains underexplored. Here, we investigate the catalytic behaviors of FeS (pure and doped with Ti, Ni, Mn, and Co), which are capable of H 2 -driven CO 2 reduction to methanol under simulated hot spring vapor-zone conditions, using an anaerobic flow chamber connected to a gas chromatograph. Specifically, Mn-doped FeS increases methanol production five-fold at 120 &#176;C, with UV&#8722;visible light (300&#8211;720 nm) and UV-enhanced light (200&#8211;600 nm) further increasing this activity. Operando and theoretical investigations indicate the mechanism involves a reverse water-gas shift with CO as an intermediate. These findings highlight the potential of FeS-catalyzed carbon fixation in early Earth&#8217;s terrestrial hot springs, effective with or without UV light.</description>

      <title>Divergent Activity Shifts of Tin&#8208;Based Catalysts for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: pH&#8208;Dependent Behavior of Single&#8208;Atom versus Polyatomic Structures</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202418228</link>

                Tin (Sn)&#8208;based catalysts have been widely studied for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to produce formic acid, but the intricate influence of the structural sensitivity in single&#8208;atom Sn (e.g., Sn&#8208;N&#8208;C) and polyatomic Sn (e.g., SnOx and SnSx; x=1,2) on their pH&#8208;dependent performance remains enigmatic. Herein, we integrate large&#8208;scale data mining (with &gt;2,300 CO2RR catalysts from available experimental literature during the past decade), ab initio computations, machine learning force field accelerated molecular dynamic simulations, and pH&#8208;field coupled microkinetic modelling to unravel their pH dependence. We reveal a fascinating contrast: the electric field response of the binding strength of *OCHO on Sn&#8208;N4&#8208;C and polyatomic Sn exhibits opposite behaviors due to their differing dipole moment changes upon *OCHO formation. Such response leads to an intriguing opposite pH&#8208;dependent volcano evolution for Sn&#8208;N4&#8208;C and polyatomic Sn. Subsequent experimental validations of turnover frequency and current density under both neutral and alkaline conditions well aligned with our theoretical predictions. Most importantly, our analysis suggests the necessity of distinct optimization strategies for *OCHO binding energy on different types of Sn&#8208;based catalysts.</description>

                The natural carbon cycle cannot mitigate and recycle the excess CO2 in the atmosphere, leading to a continuous rise in the global temperature. Electrochemical conversion of CO2 is one of the useful methods to utilise this anthropogenic CO2 and convert it into value&#8208;added chemicals. However, this process suffers the challenges of product selectivity and good Faradaic efficiency. In our current work, we report the role of Zn&#8208;doping in the 2D&#8208;Nanosheet of Cu2(OH)3(NO3)&#8208; a pre&#8208;catalyst that undergoes the in situ transformation into metallic state along with surface reconstruction. Our studies show, in the aqueous medium, the optimum amount of Zn plays a crucial role in the production of ethanol with the Faradaic efficiency of &#8764;45.2% though C&#8208;C coupling. Temperature&#8208;programmed desorption studies conclude that Zn increases the product selectivity for CO adsorption on Cu2(OH)3(NO3) nanosheets, further facilitating the C&#8208;C coupling at higher negative potential. The detailed XPS studies also reveal that the in&#8208;situ conversion of Cu2+ to Cu0 and Cu+ at negative potential contributes to the production of C2 products. The post&#8208;catalytic microstructural and spectroscopic studies converge to this point that cumulative effect of oxidation state, surface reconstruction, as well as the presence of Zn modulates overall Faradaic efficiency for ethanol formation.</description>

                The main goal of this study is to develop charging stations that use solar energy as an environmentally friendly alternative, in order to reduce carbon dioxide gas emissions produced from burning fossil fuels. The method used is qualitative with data collection through system observation and analysis of solar panel performance with dual-axis technology that can follow the movement of the sun. The results of the study show that the use of solar panels equipped with dual-axis actuators can increase the efficiency of sunlight absorption, so that the power produced is more optimal. From the analysis, it was found that these stations not only provide an efficient charging solution, but also contribute to a reduction in carbon footprint, with the potential for significant reductions in CO2 emissions. The conclusion of this study shows that the development of solar energy-based charging station technology is a strategic step in supporting the transition to a more sustainable energy source in Indonesia.</description>

                The utilization of renewable energy for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) represents a pivotal technology in sustainable carbon conversion. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) featuring transition metal&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) structures have demonstrated exceptional electrocatalytic efficacy in CO2RR by maximizing atom efficiency. Nevertheless, further investigation is warranted to optimize the catalytic performance of SACs through the selection of suitable carbon sources and supports, as well as the modulation of the microenvironment surrounding individual metal atoms. In this study, a sulfur&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C catalyst was prepared using a two&#8208;step strategy involving metal ion adsorption and thermal decomposition, with porous ion exchange resin serving as the carbon source. Due to the uniform distribution of single atom active centers on the resin&#8208;based carbon support and sulfur doping, this catalyst efficiently converts CO2 into CO with a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 90% within the range of &#8722;0.79 ~ &#8722;1.29 V (vs. RHE), reaching a maximum value of 97.7% (&#8722;0.79 V vs. RHE). Theoretical calculations indicate that second&#8208;shell sulfur doping effectively promotes coupled transfer of protons and electrons, leading to a significant reduction in Gibbs free energy barriers for CO2RR intermediate products.</description>

      <title>Impact of Supercritical Carbon Dioxide on the Physical and Chemical Properties of Leather</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.34314/xmwp9294</link>
      <description>Michael Prokein, M. Renner, Journal of the American Leather Chemists Association. 119(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404905139

                Leather, a versatile material, faces high resource consumption and waste issues in production. This study explores the use of supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) as a green solvent for leather impregnation, assessing its impact on the leather&#8217;s chemical and physical properties. Furniture and upper shoe leathers were exposed to CO2 pressures between 100 and 250 bar at 40&#176;C. Results show decreasing fat content with increased pressure, which correlates with reduced tensile strength - especially significant in upper shoe leather at 250 bar with a nearly 50% reduction in fat content from 7% to 3.7% and tensile strength from 480 N to 250 N. However, pressure treatment can also enhance tensile strength when fat reduction is low. The highest increase in tensile strength, from 110 N to 180 N, was observed for furniture leather following treatment at 100 bar. In industrial settings with lower CO2 surplus, fat extraction impacts are assumed to be minimal, suggesting significant potential for resource-efficient leather production using scCO2.</description>

                Abstract As a response to the urgent need for global climate change mitigation, negative emissions technologies have gained widespread recognition as essential tools for achieving climate goals. Among these technologies, direct air capture (DAC) and biochar are considered promising methods for carbon capture, contributing to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Biochar stands out as an environmentally friendly and cost-effective adsorbent for DAC. While both DAC and biochar technologies have undergone extensive research, limited attention has been given to the potential of using alkali-dosed biochar as a sorbent for DAC, with most validation conducted at laboratory level. This study focuses on the DAC of CO2 using a KOH-dosed biochar-based adsorbent and introduces a mobile prototype designed to accommodate a portable biochar filter. Our research explores the viability of this innovative approach for carbon capture, offering a possible solution for sectors with limited financial resources and the public.</description>

                The role of the maritime industry in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to mitigate the effects of global warming is significant. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a specific target for the industry, but the challenge is to implement emission-reducing technologies at scale. The use of fossil fuels is still dominant in the shipping sector, also due to the significant barriers that hinder the full adoption of carbon-neutral alternative fuels. The transition to a low-carbon economy presents an opportunity for the industry to lead the way towards a sustainable innovation and demonstrate a commitment to reducing its environmental impact. In this context, Carbon Capture System (CCS) technologies have been identified as a promising solution, but their implementation on ships comes with its own set of challenges. In this paper, the authors aims at exploring the technical requirements and consequences of the installation of a CCS based on the use of Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) onboard a container ship. To validate their assumptions, the authors set up a simulation tool able to evaluate the potential reduction in Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions from the ship along a selected route. On the basis of the tool outcomes, the authors were able to provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed system&#8217;s costs and benefits, emphasizing the considerable savings that could be attained through the implementation of this technology on board cargo ships with a specific consideration to the future implementation of carbon emission taxes and a focus on the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS) regulation. The findings of this research offer valuable perspectives on creating more effective and environmentally friendly approaches to mitigate GHG in the maritime sector.</description>

      <title>Decoding Double Layer Dynamics for CO2 Electroreduction over Cu</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-pzpd0</link>
      <description>Daniel Sinausia, Noam Zisser, Thierry K. Slot, David Eisenberg, Florian Meirer, Charlotte Vogt, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404760756

                Understanding of the nature and role of the electric double layer (EDL) at electrocatalytic interfaces, and its dynamic evolution, is critical to optimizing electrochemical processes such as the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Despite its postulated significant influence on CO2RR activity, direct spectroscopic evidence of the complex interplay between EDL structure and reaction kinetics has remained elusive. Here, we introduce Dynamic Response Spectroscopy (DRS), a novel approach that isolates spectroscopic signatures of key physicochemical features of the EDL, including the compact (interfacial) layer and the diffuse double layer based on their time-variance profiles. By analyzing multi dimensional time-variance within a matrix of time-resolved infrared spectral data recorded during sequential potential steps, we reveal that EDL equilibration is not continuous but involves discrete restructuring events. We correlate these sudden EDL reorganizations with the rapid adsorption and conversion of CO2 to CO, providing - to the best of our knowledge - the first direct spectroscopic evidence of such a phenomenon. Furthermore, we show that saturation of aqueous NaHCO3 electrolytes with CO2, as opposed to Ar, induces more frequent and pronounced water reorientation in the diffuse double layer, characterized by less ice-like ordering and increased randomness. These findings provide novel insights into the dynamic nature of the EDL and its synergistic role in electrocatalysis, establishing a paradigm to better understand, and thus optimize electrochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Governance on the Belt and Road Initiative Toward a Carbon-Zero, Regional, Eco-Friendly Logistics Hub: A Difference-In-Differences Perspective</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/systems12120532</link>
      <description>Xia Tian, Siyu Li, Yunning Ma, Yongrok Choi, Hyoung Seok Lee, Systems. 12(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404827011

                The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) proposed by China in in 2013 prioritizes environmental sustainability and regional economic development from a global perspective. Although the BRI has achieved considerable economic progress in many cities and regions, research on its environmental impacts is still insufficient, with limited attention paid to domestic urban areas in particular. Existing studies have focused primarily on carbon emissions, ignoring the broader environmental impacts of industrial emissions, such as those from smart transportation. To address this gap, this study adopts four major pollutant emissions&#8212;carbon dioxide (CO2), industrial particulate matter, industrial sulfur dioxide (SO2), and industrial wastewater emissions&#8212;as indicators to assess pollution levels in urban environments. Adopting panel data from 281 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2021, this study employs the difference-in-differences (DID) method to estimate the effect of the BRI on urban environmental pollution. This study is based on the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 1. BRI implementation has reduced urban pollution emissions. Hypothesis 2. Advancements in science and technology will drive the implementation of the BRI. Hypothesis 3. A proactive government response can significantly reduce urban environmental pollution. The main findings of this study are as follows. First, BRI implementation significantly reduces urban environmental pollution by 1.05%. Second, the policy effects of the BRI are more pronounced in the eastern and western regions and in larger cities, implying that geopolitical- and market-oriented strategies are important for regional performance. Third, scientific and technological progress positively affects pollution reduction in urban environments. Fourth, the BRI contributes to strengthening government intervention, which subsequently improves sustainable governance, reduces urban environmental pollution, and promotes regional economic cooperation. Our findings will serve as a crucial reference for future policymaking endeavors toward eco-friendly logistics cooperation in the region.</description>

                Abstract Accurate energy system modelling of chemical separations is a critical component of technology selection to minimize operating costs, energy consumption and emissions. Here we report a hybrid modelling approach based on data-driven and mechanistic models to holistically compare chemical separation performance. Our model can be used to select the most suitable technology for a given chemical separation, such as membrane separation, evaporation, extraction or hybrid configurations, by training a machine learning model to predict solute rejection using an open-access membrane dataset. We estimated an average 40% reduction in energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions for industrially relevant separations using our methodology. We predicted and analysed 7.1 million solute rejections across several industrial sectors. Pharmaceutical purification could realize carbon dioxide emissions reductions of up to 90% by selecting the most efficient technology. We mapped the reduction in carbon dioxide emissions and the reduction in operating costs globally, establishing parameter thresholds to facilitate corporate and governmental decision-making.</description>

                Novel amides of some amino and citric acids were synthesized and studied for their ability to improve the kinetics of carbon dioxide hydrate formation. It was demonstrated that these compounds can be effective promoters of hydrate formation, even at low concentrations. The addition of citric acid and norleucine amide (CTR+Nle) increased the water-to-hydrate conversion and significantly reduced the induction time. At a concentration of 0.05 wt. %, the conversion rate reached 57 &#177; 3 %, which is 21 and 3.1 % higher than in water without additives and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution, respectively. In the presence of CTR+Nle, the induction time decreased to 35 min, which is an 8.1-fold reduction compared to water without additives, as well as 5.8-fold less than with tryptophan solution known as a promoter of carbon dioxide hydrate formation.</description>

                The report discusses the serious environmental issues Indonesia's growing economy and rising energy use have brought about. In addition to examining government initiatives to lessen these impacts through sustainable development regulations, the goals include evaluating the connection between economic indicators and environmental results. The research employs a mixed-approaches strategy, combining quantitative and qualitative methods. The quantitative analysis, which employs time series data from 1991 to 2020, focuses on carbon dioxide emissions per capita as the dependent variable and GDP and energy consumption per capita as independent variables. Multiple linear regression using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) evaluates these correlations. A thorough grasp of the relationship between economic growth, energy consumption, and environmental deterioration is provided by qualitative analysis, which entails a review of the literature to investigate government initiatives addressing environmental concerns. The study results show a substantial positive correlation between Indonesia's carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) emissions, energy consumption, and economic development. The analysis indicates that the ongoing economic activities driven by fossil fuel consumption will exacerbate environmental degradation without significant intervention, necessitating effective government policies for sustainable development and emission reduction. The study concludes that economic growth and energy consumption significantly contribute to Indonesia's environmental degradation, particularly through increased carbon dioxide (CO&#8322;) emissions. It recommends that the government strengthen policies promoting sustainable energy use, increase investment in renewable energy technologies, and implement stricter regulations on industrial emissions. Additionally, fostering public awareness and education on environmental sustainability is crucial for effective long-term solutions.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Analysis on the Use of Sustainable Fuels in the Aviation Industry</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.23890/ijast.vm05is02.0202</link>
      <description>Ya&#351;ar K&#214;SE, Emre O&#287;uzhan Polat, International Journal of Aviation Science and Technology. vm05(is02)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404756904

                This study aims to analyze and evaluate different types of alternative fuels for aviation from a life cycle and cost perspective. It aims to analyze different alternative fuels and their use in aircraft for this purpose in the aviation sector in relation to their potential to be a suitable transition solution towards sustainable transformation. Using the GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies) aviation module developed by the US National Research Laboratory (Argonne), the life cycles of petroleum and six different sustainable aviation fuel production methods were calculated, and the environmental impact of kerosene and sustainable aviation fuels in terms of cost and carbon dioxide emissions on long, medium and short-haul flights were analyzed. The life cycle values of carbon dioxide formed as a result of the production of corn, soybean and canola products, which are the most preferred to produce biofuel in the aviation industry, with hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), alcohol-to-jet (ATJ), ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) methods, were calculated. As a result of the study, it was determined that the cost of the sustainable aviation fuels examined was higher than fossil fuel. The key to greater acceptance and deployment of sustainable aviation fuel is cost reduction. In the long term, this will require investment in advanced technologies to process feedstocks more efficiently on a larger scale and in the development of sustainable and scalable feedstock options. However, in the short term, temporary support from governments and other stakeholders through policy incentives is needed.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Oltu Stone (Turbostratic Carbon) from the Olur-Tortum Area: A Natural Composite Carbonaceous Material (Erzurum, T&#252;rkiye)</title>

                This study focuses on geological, microstructural, oxygen isotopic, and thermogravimetric investigations of Oltu stone, which is the most important turbostratic carbonaceous material in Turkey. The results of our investigations indicate that the carbonaceous Oltu stone material (specific gravity of 1.317) is not an organic material, such as jet, derived from fossilized wood. Rather, it is composed of a carbonaceous phase intermediate between amorphous carbon and crystallized graphite (termed turbostratic carbon), that is intercalated with flysch and formed by the reduction of seeping magmatic carbon dioxide during the diagenesis of Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous marine sediments. Oxygen isotope analyses (SMOW) (using EA-IRMS) of both Oltu stone (&#948;18O = +37.2&#8240;to +40.8&#8240;) and the enclosing flysches (&#948;18O = +10.3&#8240; to +12.3&#8240;) suggest that the nodules formed during diagenesis at a temperature of around 50 &#8451;. However, they are enclosed in flysches whose grains are derived from rocks that formed at significantly higher temperatures, perhaps above 100 &#8451;. The main industrial use of Oltu stone is as host material for diamond coating, as the sp3 bonds in the material can provide nucleation sites for diamond crystals and improve the nucleation rate at the early stage of diamond deposition on turbostratic carbon.</description>

      <title>Application of Nanocomposites in Covalent Organic Framework-Based Electrocatalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/nano14231907</link>
      <description>Haiping Zhou, Kechang Li, Qingqing Pan, Zhong&#8208;Min Su, Rui Wang, Nanomaterials. 14(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404756219

                In recent years, the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion and environmental remediation has become a topic of great interest. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), linked by covalent bonds, have emerged as promising materials in the field of electrocatalysis due to their well-defined structures, high specific surface areas, tunable pore structures, and excellent acid&#8211;base stability. However, the low conductivity of COF materials often limits their intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. To enhance the catalytic performance of COF-based catalysts, various nanomaterials are integrated into COFs to form composite catalysts. The stable and tunable porous structure of COFs provides an ideal platform for these nanomaterials, leading to improved electrocatalytic activity. Through rational design, COF-based composite electrocatalysts can achieve synergistic effects between nanomaterials and the COF carrier, enabling efficient targeted electrocatalysis. This review summarizes the applications of nanomaterial-incorporated COF-based catalysts in hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction. Additionally, it outlines design principles for COF-based composite electrocatalysis, focusing on structure&#8211;activity relationships and synergistic effects in COF composite nanomaterial electrocatalysts, as well as challenges and future perspectives for next-generation composite electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Constructing Asymmetric Cu Catalytic Sites for CO2 Electroreduction with Higher Selectivity to C2 Products</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202402120</link>
      <description>Fanfei Meng, Xiaohui Yao, Jingting He, Jianxia Gu, Wei Li, Chunyi Sun, Sheng Wang, Zhong&#8208;Min Su, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404728889

                The design of catalytic sites with tunable properties is considered a promising approach to advance the reduction of CO2 into valuable fuels and chemicals, as well as to achieve carbon neutrality. However, significant challenges remain in precisely constructing catalytic sites to adjust target reduction products. In this study, catalysts were derived from metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) with different coordination environments during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR), referred to as Cu&#8208;N2O2 and Cu&#8208;N2O3, respectively. Higher selectivity towards the production of C2 products was exhibited by the Cu&#8208;N2O2&#8208;derived catalysts, characterized by asymmetric catalytic centers of Cu0 and Cu+, compared to the Cu&#8208;N2O3&#8208;derived catalysts, which contained only symmetric catalytic centers of Cu0 sites. This enhanced selectivity is attributed to the synergistic interaction between the Cu0 and Cu+ sites, facilitating the multi&#8208;electron transfer process and improving the activation of CO2. This study explores how the coordination environment affects the catalytic performance of catalysts derived from MOFs, providing valuable insights for the development of more effective catalysts aimed at CO2 reduction.</description>

                The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (eCO2RR) shows great potential in the realization of carbon neutrality, which requires a dedicated catalyst design. To develop electrocatalysts that favor C2 products, herein, the synthetic protocol for engineering interlayered single-atom metal active sites on the bipyridine-linked 2D conjugated covalent-organic framework (2D c-COF) has been developed by utilizing the interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking. The resultant M@BTT-BPy-COF (where M = Cu, Ni, and Fe) provides fully exposed single-atom active sites with a suitable interdistance for catalyzing the key C&#8211;C coupling in the eCO2RR process. The Faradaic efficiency of ethanol (FEethanol) exceeds 40% with M@BTT-BPy-COF at &#8722;0.8 V vs RHE, outperforming most reported COF-based electrocatalysts. Density functional calculations suggest that the proximal active sites in the pore channel of COFs are the key active sites for promoting the C&#8211;C coupling to generate ethanol product. This investigation presents a novel way to engineer single-atom catalytic centers on 2D c-COFs, displaying the great potential of 2D c-COFs in electrocatalysis.</description>

                The CO2 electroreduction reaction has advantages in clean and pollution&#8208;free carbon conversion, but it still faces challenges in carbon utilization efficiency and improving the selectivity of C2+ products. Although the dynamic Cu&#948;+ state is known to favor the C&#8208;C coupling process, the Cu&#948;+ species suitable for electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 are difficult to maintain under the conditions of strong reduction and large current. Herein, we propose a Ce doping strategy (Ce/CuOx) to protect the Cu&#948;+ state in the CO2RR process, which enables a high Faradaic efficiency of 60% for multi&#8208;carbon products (40% for C2H4, 14% for CH3CH2OH, and 6% for CH3COOH), and 25 h stability at &#8208;1.2 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. In&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ XPS combined with density functional theory calculations reveal that the Cu&#948;+ is stabilized by the redox ion pairs of Ce, which reduces the energy barrier of *CO coupling, and improves the Faraday efficiency of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction of C2H4. This work provides an idea to make full use of lanthanide variable value metals to maintain the stability of dynamic Cu&#948;+ state and improve the performance of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2H4.</description>

                Abstract Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) conversion into valuable chemicals paves the way for the realization of carbon recycling. Downsizing catalysts to single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), and sub&#8208;nanocluster catalysts (SNCCs) has generated highly active and selective CO 2 transformation into highly reduced products. This is due to the introduction of numerous active sites, highly unsaturated coordination environments, efficient atom utilization, and confinement effect compared to their nanoparticle counterparts. Herein, recent Cu&#8208;based SACs are first reviewed and the newly emerged DACs and SNCCs expanding the catalysis of SACs to electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction (CO 2 RR) to high&#8208;value products are discussed. Tandem Cu&#8208;based SAC&#8211;nanocatalysts (NCs) (SAC&#8211;NCs) are also discussed for the CO 2 RR to high&#8208;value products. Then, the non&#8208;Cu&#8208;based SACs, DACs, SAC&#8211;NCs, and SNCCs and theoretical calculations of various transition&#8208;metal catalysts for CO 2 RR to high&#8208;value products are summarized. Compared to previous achievements of less&#8208;reduced products, this review focuses on the double objective of achieving full CO 2 reduction and increasing the selectivity and formation rate toward C&#8211;C coupled products with additional emphasis on the stability of the catalysts. Finally, through combined theoretical and experimental research, future outlooks are offered to further develop the CO 2 RR into high&#8208;value products over isolated atoms and sub&#8208;nanometal clusters.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction to n&#8208;propanol, a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density C 3 chemical, presents a promising method for the long&#8208;term storage of renewable electricity. However, the C 1 &#8208;C 2 coupling step, crucial for C 3 conversion, suffers from low selectivity and sluggish conversion rate. In this study, a strategy is proposed to regulate the adsorption of C 2 active species on Cu by introducing an atomically dispersed Zr, which can effectively enhance the electroreduction of CO 2 to n&#8208;propanol. In situ infrared spectroscopy and theoretical studies unveil that the introduce of atomically dispersed Zr modulates the adsorption configuration of * C 2 intermediates and strengtnens the binding with * C 2 intermediates, thus lowing the energy barrier of the C 1 &#8211;C 2 coupling process and accelerating the conversion efficiency. This novel catalyst achieves a n&#8208;propanol Faradaic efficiency of 14.4 &#177; 0.3% and a high production rate of 70.0 &#177; 1.0 mA cm &#8722;2 , comparable to the best reported values of the CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;propanol electroconversion. This study highlights the effectiveness of designing synergistic electrocatalysts to boost the production of high&#8208;value energy products, providing a promising path toward achieving carbon neutrality.</description>

      <title>Carbon reduction powered by natural electrochemical gradients under submarine hydrothermal vent conditions</title>

                Energy metabolism at the emergence of life has been the topic of intense theoretical and experimental study. Alkaline hydrothermal vents (AHVs) may have facilitated energy-transfer and carbon-fixation at life&#8217;s emergence, via a primordial chemiosmotic mechanism. Specifically, pH separation across vent walls could have been the forerunner to pH separation across microbial membranes, with electron-conductive inorganic barriers containing [Ni-]FeS minerals mimicking the active sites of metalloenzymes in potentially ancient biological reductive acetyl-CoA Wood-Ljungdahl (WL) pathway, reverse Krebs and other metabolic pathways. We previously demonstrated pH gradient dependent reduction of CO2 to formate by H2 in AHV interface conditions. Here, we address the same problem of CO2 reduction, however using a macroscale reactor that allowed us to use minerals synthesized via protocols analogous to the alkaline vent mount formation. This reactor also allowed us to probe more variables, and explore longer experimentation time-frames. Thus, this work aimed to investigate the effect of the different aspects of the gradientrich hydrothermal-vent interface on the observed CO2 electrochemical reduction- such as different minerals, temperature gradients, as well as the flow of electrons under passive vs. induced currents and potentials. Using experimental simulations and electrochemistry techniques, We detected two key steps of the WL pathway (CO2 to formic acid, and the formation acetic acid) as well as reactions in the reverse Krebs cycle (fumarate to succinate). Both Ni in the mineral, and temperature as a property, were shown to affect the formation of formate. Extremely small currents were enough to efficiently carry out CO2 reduction. This work develops benchmarks to electrochemically explore the model of protometabolisms in the vent-ocean interface and opens to future analyses on the catalytic or electrocatalytic properties of Fe-[Ni-]S minerals as precursors of metalloenzymes.</description>

                The focus of this study is to design and simulate a grid tied solar PV system for a higher institution of learning using University of Botswana, Faculty of Engineering and Technology building as a case. The grid-connected system aimed at reducing the energy bill and contributes to the reduction of the CO2 emissions. The system uses the physical data and PVsyst software and OpenSolar and google earth to determine the key parameters crucial for the design of the project. Technical performance analysis of the proposed rooftop PV plant showed that the energy injected into the grid, with consideration of all losses amounts to 480MWh/year with a substantial lifetime carbon reduction of 991.2tons. The economic evaluation of the designed system showed that the project is profitable at the discontinued payback period of 8.63 years and the annual energy bill reduction of 32% is achieved. These results are beneficial to institutions and any other entity that would like to migrate from their use of conventional power in that they will gain an insight on their CO2 emission reduction and contribution to the national quota, their expected energy and cost savings. Governments and utilities can also benefit from these results in integrating with their energy and CO2 emissions.</description>

                Carbon Capture Utilization Storage (CCUS) into geological storage (e.g., Enhanced Oil or Gas Recovery) provides a solution to reduce CO&#173;2 emissions. However, it still remains a potential operational problem, such as sand problem phenomena in producer wells. This study observes the phenomenon of sand problems in production wells possibly triggered by CO2-brine-rock interactions on CO2 injection in rich dolomite sandstone reservoir. This research performs several experimental works (i.e., time-lapse dry mass measurements, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and elastic wave measurements) by using CO2-brine-rock batch experimental setup as well as geochemical simulation to observe mineral dissolution, pore structures alteration as well as rock physics alteration due to CO2-brine-rock interactions. We used an outcrop sample of dolomite-rich sandstone from the Air Benakat Formation, South Sumatera, Indonesia. Our experimental and simulation works show that dolomite dissolution (dolomite reduction of ~4% after 14 soaking days), secondary porosity development (11% of visible porosity improvement), as well as rock strength reduction, occur indirectly (shown by elastic wave velocity, i.e. and reduction of ~3.8% and ~4.4%, respectively) due to CO2-brine-rock interactions. Subsequently, the results of elastic wave velocity measurements were then used to modify a considerable sand onset prediction (sand-free envelope) model. The modified model showed that the production well was more prone to sand problems due to CO2-brine-rock interactions. Thus, it is concluded that the sand onset prediction model with considering CO2-brine-rock interactions could help to design a better sand management strategy in producer wells.</description>

                Abstract The preparation of ethylene from ethane, a main component of shale gas, has become an important process of the petrochemical industry, using ethane steam cracking at high temperatures (&gt;900 &#176;C), which is a highly energy intensive industry. Here, direct dehydrogenation of ethane is engineered electrochemically to produce ethylene and hydrogen in a proton&#8208;conducting electrolysis cell, achieving over 50% ethane conversion and 90.42% ethylene selectivity at 700 &#176;C. On the basis of constructing NiCu bimetallic alloy nano&#8208;catalyst on the surface of perovskite Sr 3 Fe 2 O 7 , Hafnium (Hf) element is doped in the bulk phase to improve proton conductivity, establish triple conductivity, and achieve efficient directional conversion of ethane. The carbon dioxide reduction reaction at the cathode is further coupled, resulting in a higher conversion of ethane on the anode side and the production of syngas on the cathode side. This electrochemical reaction process provides a choice for the clean production of high value&#8208;added small molecule chemical products.</description>

      <title>Relationships between the Surface Hydrophilicity of a Bismuth Electrode and the Product Selectivity of Electrocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction</title>

                Two types of bismuth films (micro-Bi and nano-Bi) were prepared, and their electrocatalytic behavior was studied in terms of reduction current and product selectivity in a potential range of &#8722;0.776 to &#8722;1.376 V vs RHE. CO2 and H2O molecules competed with each other for reduction on the surfaces of both types of films, and formate and H2 were the respective major products of reductive reactions. Under the same conditions, nano-Bi exhibited lower selectivity for formate and higher selectivity for H2 compared to the respective micro-Bi cases with bismuth films of similar thickness. This can be attributed to the higher hydrophilicity of bismuth film surfaces of nano-Bi due to surface nanoscale roughness and lower surface-carbon content compared with those of micro-Bi. Our results suggest a new strategy for controlling the selectivity of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction under aqueous electrolytes through the use of surface engineering.</description>

      <title>Direct low concentration CO2 electroreduction to multicarbon products via rate-determining step tuning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54590-7</link>
      <description>Liangyiqun Xie, Yanming Cai, Yujing Jiang, Meikun Shen, Chun Ho Lam, Jun&#8208;Jie Zhu, Wenlei Zhu, Nature Communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404856717

                Direct converting low concentration CO2 in industrial exhaust gases to high-value multi-carbon products via renewable-energy-powered electrochemical catalysis provides a sustainable strategy for CO2 utilization with minimized CO2 separation and purification capital and energy cost. Nonetheless, the electrocatalytic conversion of dilute CO2 into value-added chemicals (C2+ products, e.g., ethylene) is frequently impeded by low CO2 conversion rate and weak carbon intermediates' surface adsorption strength. Here, we fabricate a range of Cu catalysts comprising fine-tuned Cu(111)/Cu2O(111) interface boundary density crystal structures aimed at optimizing rate-determining step and decreasing the thermodynamic barriers of intermediates' adsorption. Utilizing interface boundary engineering, we attain a Faradaic efficiency of (51.9 &#177; 2.8) % and a partial current density of (34.5 &#177; 6.4) mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 for C2+ products at a dilute CO2 feed condition (5% CO2 v/v), comparing to the state-of-art low concentration CO2 electrolysis. In contrast to the prevailing belief that the CO2 activation step ( $${{CO}}_{2}+{e}^{-}+\, * \,\to {}^{ * }{CO}_{2}^{-}$$ ) governs the reaction rate, we discover that, under dilute CO2 feed conditions, the rate-determining step shifts to the generation of *COOH ( $${}^{ * } {{CO}}_{2}^{-}+{H}_{2}O\to {}^{ * } {COOH}+{{OH}}^{-}({aq})$$ ) at the Cu0/Cu1+ interface boundary, resulting in a better C2+ production performance. The development of catalysts that operate under low concentration CO2 resembling industrial waste gases holds promise for CO2 reduction. Here, the authors report a vacuum calcination approach for regulating the Cu0/Cu1+ density on Cu-based catalysts that can electro-catalyze low-concentration CO2.</description>

      <title>The Valorisation of Biochar Produced from Black Liquor Pyrolysis for the Development of CO2 Adsorbents</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29235613</link>
      <description>Anca Zaharioiu, Violeta&#8208;Carolina Niculescu, Claudia &#350;andru, Stefan Ionu&#539; Spiridon, Amalia Soare, Simona Oancea, Florian Marin, Molecules. 29(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404757943

                The paper manufacturing process produces liquid and gaseous alternative fuels, as well as solid wastes. These can be subsequently treated through chemical processing, oxidation, and thermal activation, resulting in adsorbent materials with CO2 adsorption capacities. The valorisation of black liquor waste resulting from paper manufacturing was achieved through a catalytic pyrolysis process using two catalysts previously prepared in house (Cu-Zn-MCM-41 and Ni-SBA-16). The HCl-treated adsorbent material, resulting from Ni-SBA-16-catalysed pyrolysis, was selected for use in CO2 adsorption tests as it had the highest specific surface area (224.06 m2/g) and pore volume (0.28 cm3/g). The adsorption experimental setup was linked to a gas chromatograph in order to evaluate CO2 adsorption efficiency using a binary gas mixture consisting of 81% CO2 and 19% N2. With a CO2 adsorption capacity of 1.61 mmol/g, a separation efficiency of 99.78%, and a CO2 recovery yield of 90.02%, it can be concluded that the developed adsorbent material resulting from Ni-SBA16-catalysed pyrolysis and HCl treatment represents a viable solution for black liquor pyrolytic solid waste removal and reduction in greenhouse gases.</description>

      <title>Cost&#8211;Benefit Analysis of the China&#8217;s Household Coal-to-Electricity Transition: A Case Study on the Beijing Mentougou Area</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17235933</link>
      <description>Yanran Pan, Lei Jiang, Hui Wang, Energies. 17(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404712107

                Since 2013, China has implemented clean heating projects such as the coal-to-electricity project to reduce emissions and improve air quality in northern China, but it still requires significant investment from governments, businesses, and households. However, the benefits of coal-to-electricity to improve the rural family environment have received less attention. In this study, we conducted a cost&#8211;benefit analysis of the coal-to-electricity transition in Beijing&#8217;s Mentougou District from 2013 to 2017, distinguishing private costs and benefits, government costs and public benefits, and social costs and benefits. The results show that for all coal-to-electricity households, the private benefits far outweigh the private costs, with a benefit&#8211;cost ratio of 15.9. The government costs outweigh the benefit of air pollutants and carbon dioxide emission reduction, with a benefit&#8211;cost ratio of 0.4. Overall, the social benefits outweigh the social costs: the benefit&#8211;cost ratio for society was 2.2. The environmental benefits of the coal-to-electricity policies did not offset the large amount of investment of the government, but society received a positive net benefit owing to the large benefits gained by rural households. This also proves that the investment by the government is efficient and verifies the government&#8217;s next step to continue to promote the coal-to-electricity transition.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of the CO2 Flooding Front for CO2-EOR in Unconventional Reservoirs: Considering the Different Miscibilities of CO2-Crude Oil</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/223225-ms</link>
      <description>Xiliang Liu, Hao Chen, Weiming Cheng, Chenghao Xu, Mingsheng Zuo, Shuaiqiang Gao, Yi Wu, Haipeng Liu, Xinyu Qi, Mahaman Sidi Brahim, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404784636

                Abstract Both laboratory tests and pilot wells have demonstrated the significant potential of CO2 as an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) medium. Due to the weak pressure conduction and mass transfer of the CO2-oil system, multiple zones are generated between the injection well and production well in ultra-low permeability reservoirs. This work aims to explore the characteristics of these multiple zones and the mechanisms of CO2-EOR by combining experimental results, core-scale analysis, and field-scale simulation. Long-core CO2 displacement experiments were conducted under different miscibility pressures, with production gas assayed using gas chromatography. The core-scale simulation was aligned with the experimental results, defining four CO2 fronts to distinguish different zones based on pressure, interfacial tension, and CO2 concentration along the long core. The distribution of five zones was upscaled to the field-scale model after pilot well history matching. The final step involved evaluating the miscible zone range value, CO2 injection utilization factor, oil recovery, and CO2 storage efficiency during the CO2 injection process. Results show that the boundary between the original oil zone and the oil transition zone exists at the CO2 component front, where the CO2 concentration is zero. Additionally, the location of the CO2 component front does not overlap with the contact interface of CO2-crude oil, meaning that the dissolution effect of CO2 in the oil transition zone results in the CO2 component front moving farther. Besides, when the formation pressure is higher than the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP), the distance between the CO2-effective phase front and the CO2-effective component front further expands as the pressure increases, enlarging the miscible zone range. The pressure accumulates around the injection well because of slow pressure conduction. When the average formation pressure reaches 1.1 MMP, the miscible zone range is enlarged by 2.7% higher than that of the near miscible flooding (0.92 MMP), leading to a higher rate of oil recovery by 8.6% and a utilization factor of CO2 by 0.14t/t. It is for the first time that the range of five zones and the characteristics of four CO2 fronts migration is assessed, furnishing an in-depth understanding of the complicated mechanisms and phase behavior in CO2 EOR in the ultra-low permeability oil reservoir. This work contributes to providing significant information for designing an economic and environmental CO2 flooding strategy and is significant in the improvement of oil recovery and the reduction of CO2 emission.</description>

      <title>A geospatial approach for dynamic on-road emission through open-access floating car data</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad984d</link>
      <description>Pak Lun Fung, Omar Al-Jaghbeer, Jia Chen, Ville-Veikko Paunu, Shaghayegh Vosough, Claudio Roncoli, Leena J&#228;rvi, Environmental Research Letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404801485

                Abstract This paper presents a geospatial approach for quantifying street-level on-road emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), nitrogen oxides (NO x ), and carbon monoxide (CO). By leveraging an existing open-access database of real-time congestion information derived from floating car data, we tested three methods to map high-resolution dynamic traffic emissions. To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the methods, we showcased results for summer workdays and winter weekends in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA). The three methods employed include (1) a physics-based relation known as the macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD), (2) a data-driven input-adaptive generalized linear model (GLM), and (3) their ensemble (ENS). These methods estimated traffic density with satisfactory accuracy (R 2 = 0.60&#8211;0.88, sMAPE = 31&#8211;68%). Utilizing speed-dependent emission factors retrieved from a European database, the results compared favorably against the downscaled national emission inventory, particularly for CO 2 (R 2 = 0.70&#8211;0.77). Among the three methods, GLM exhibited the best overall performance in the HMA, while ENS provided a robust upscaling solution. The modeled emissions exhibited dynamic diurnal and spatial behavior, influenced by different functional road classes, fleet compositions and congestion patterns. Congestion-induced emissions were calculated to account for up to 10% of the total vehicular emissions. Furthermore, to anticipate the forthcoming transportation transformation, we calculated emission changes under scenarios with various penetration rates of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) using this geospatial approach. The introduction of CAVs could result in emission reductions of 3&#8211;14% owing to congestion improvements.</description>

                Abstract The red alga Asparagopsis taxiformis has recently been recognized for its unique ability to significantly reduce methane emissions from ruminant animals when fed in small quantities. The main obstacle in using this seaweed as a methane&#8208;mitigating feed supplement is the lack of commercially available biomass. Little is known about how best to grow this red alga on a commercial scale, as there are few published studies that have investigated the factors that influence growth, physiology, and overall performance. This study examined the effects of temperature and CO 2 enrichment on the growth, photophysiology, and concentration of bromoform, the secondary metabolite largely responsible for methane reduction in A. taxiformis . A series of single and multifactor closed culture experiments were conducted on A. taxiformis collected, isolated, and cultured from populations in Southern California. We identified the optimal temperature range to be between 22 and 26&#176;C, with significant short&#8208;term stress observed below 15&#176;C and above 26&#176;C. Carbon dioxide addition resulted in increased performance, when accounting for growth per CO 2 use. In general, we observed the highest bromoform concentrations in algae with the highest growth rates, but these results varied among experiments. These findings indicate that through environmental control and by addressing limiting resources, significant increases in biomass production and quality can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Characteristics and Challenges of Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies</title>

                Climate change is a pressing global issue, leading to the establishment of various carbon reduction goals, and thus carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has attracted considerable attention. This article provides an overview of the primary carbon capture and storage technologies, explores their technical principles along with their pros and cons, and examines the challenges they encounter. There are three ways to capture carbon: post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxy-combustion. Post-combustion capture includes adsorption, absorption and membrane separation. Adsorption can be further categorized into four specific technologies: Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA), Pressure swing adsorption (PSA), Vacuum swing adsorption (VSA), and Electric swing adsorption (ESA). Absorption has physical and chemical types. Membrane separation is to filter the gas to CO2. Pre-combustion capture is to use physical solvents to separate the gas. Oxy-combustion uses pure oxygen to obtain CO2. There are three ways to store carbon, geo-sequestration, marine storage and mineralization storage. Geo-sequestration is to bury CO2 in a suitable state in the rock layer below the surface. Marine storage is to bury CO2 in various places in the sea in a classified manner. Mineralization storage refers to the use of solid waste rich in calcium and magnesium to mineralize CO2 and produce chemical products. There are three main challenges facing CCS technology: economically, the cost is too high with low benefits. The technology is not mature enough and will consume too much energy. Environmentally, there is a potential for ecological deterioration.</description>

      <title>Spatial and temporal variation in water availability across high mountain gravelly pavement herbfields affects the distribution of hydrophilic plant species</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-024-05763-4</link>

                Gravelly pavement herbfields are a groundwater-dependant vegetation type; water composition and supply are hypothesised to be a crucial factor affecting the distribution of plant species in the community. We described the relationship between plant species distribution in pavements and the spatial and temporal availability and composition of water. Water flows into pavements varied through the growing season, as did lateral spread of water, and its permanency. Furthermore, the distribution of dominant pavement plant species was associated with moisture. Oreobolus pumilio (Cyperaceae) was significantly negatively associated, whilst Psychrophila introloba (Ranunculaceae) was significantly positively associated, with persistent moisture. The chemical composition of water changed whilst transiting through pavements, with loss of dissolved CO2 and an increase in pH likely due to strong CO2 evasion. When compared with other hydrologic units across the landscape, the chemical composition of pavement waters was between that of groundwater and peatlands, corresponding to their physical position in the landscape. These results have implications for the conservation of the gravelly pavement herbfield community. With climate change, reductions in water availability threatens the persistence of key hydrophilic species given their strong association with moisture. Reductions in areal extent, as well as re-organisation of the plant community, could be expected.</description>

      <title>Satellite Data and Machine Learning for Benchmarking Methane Concentrations in the Canadian Dairy Industry</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su162310400</link>
      <description>Hanqing Bi, Suresh Neethirajan, Sustainability. 16(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404757044

                Amid escalating climate change concerns, methane&#8212;a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential far exceeding that of carbon dioxide&#8212;demands urgent attention. The Canadian dairy industry significantly contributes to methane emissions through cattle enteric fermentation and manure management practices. Precise benchmarking of these emissions is critical for developing effective mitigation strategies. This study ingeniously integrates eight years of Sentinel-5P satellite data with advanced machine learning techniques to establish a methane concentration benchmark and predict future emission trends in the Canadian dairy sector. By meticulously analyzing weekly methane concentration data from 575 dairy farms and 384 dairy processors, we uncovered intriguing patterns: methane levels peak during autumn, and Ontario exhibits the highest concentrations among all provinces. The COVID-19 pandemic introduced unexpected shifts in methane emissions due to altered production methods and disrupted supply chains. Our Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model adeptly captures methane concentration trends, providing a powerful tool for planning and reducing emissions from dairy operations. This pioneering approach not only demonstrates the untapped potential of combining satellite data with machine learning for environmental monitoring but also paves the way for informed emission reduction strategies in the dairy industry. Future endeavors will focus on enhancing satellite data accuracy, integrating more granular farm and processor variables, and refining machine learning models to bolster prediction precision.</description>

      <title>How Can Outdoor Air Pollutants Adversely Affect the Women&#8217;s Fertility? Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.4103/abr.abr_45_24</link>
      <description>Masoomeh Latifi, Fakher Rahim, Mojtaba Ahmadlou, Nima Pouladian, Leili Allahbakhshian, Advanced Biomedical Research. 13(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404856637

                In the current century, air pollution is known as one of the most critical environmental problems and it is important to find the relations of air pollution and human health. Various air pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), can negatively affect women&#8217;s fertility. An exhaustive electronic search was done from 2013 until July 2023 in PUBMED and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The following keywords were combined using Boolean hints in the databases queried: air pollution AND (fertility OR miscarriage OR embryo quality OR embryo development OR pregnancy OR implantation OR live birth). The randomized controlled trials, case-control and cohort studies analyzing the impact of air pollutants on fertility were included in the review. In this systematic review, a significant relation was found between the increase in air pollution and the reduction of fertility health, live birth rates, embryo quality, fertility, implantation rates, and miscarriage in exposed women. These results suggest low fertility health rates are associated with traffic-related air pollution. This review has concluded four components (particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur, and carbon monoxide) of traffic pollution that can impair women&#8217;s fertility. Air pollution harms women&#8217;s fertility. These effects affect gamete&#8217;s quality at the genetic and epigenetic level. These effects also alter fetal development. Studies have also reported an effect on fetal growth with increased miscarriages. Since air pollution is everywhere and has many sources, it seems necessary to increase the awareness of people and government officials, especially in hygiene and health, to limit air pollutants as much as possible.</description>

                _ This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper SPE 219309, &#8220;The Economics of CCUS Projects in Conjunction With Large Offshore Gas Projects,&#8221; by Chresten S. Meulengracht, SPE, NRG Models, and Deddy Hasanusi, Semesta Energi Services. The paper has not been peer reviewed. _ The complete paper examines the economics of carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS) projects, either standalone or in conjunction with large offshore gas projects, in Denmark, Indonesia, and Australia. An analysis of the legislation in these countries reveals to what degree the frameworks are defined to support CCUS projects. Economic-robustness analyses of the projects are performed to determine under which circumstances CCUS strengthens or weakens the business cases for the operators. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)/CCUS Legislation in Three Countries Denmark. Summary and History of Legislation. Denmark initiated its first CCS legislation by issuing permits in 2023 for CO2 storage exploration in the Danish North Sea to three companies with exclusive exploration rights for 6 years, extendable to 30 years if suitable storage locations are found. A significant initiative is the Greensand project, aiming to store up to 8 mtpa CO2 by 2030. These efforts are part of Denmark&#8217;s goal to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045. The second bidding round for onshore CO2 storage has been completed, and licenses will be awarded in 2024. The Danish government has proposed a plan for onshore CCS to achieve reductions of at least 3.2 million tonnes of CO2 by 2030. CO2 Taxes. Denmark&#8217;s government has proposed a uniform CO2 emissions tax for businesses. However, not all companies will pay the same rate, according to the proposal. The government proposal, entitled Green Tax Reform, aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 3.7 million tonnes by 2030. The government proposes a CO2 tax of 750 kroner per tonne of emission. Companies covered by an EU quota system will receive a deduction and only will be required to pay half of the full amount. Companies in the mineralogical processing sector are to be given further discounts on the tax and only will pay 100 kroner per tonne of emissions. CCUS Incentives. The Danish Energy Agency has created two subsidy funds, the CCUS Fund and the Negative Emissions via CCS (NECCS) Fund, to support the deployment of CCS technology in Denmark. The CCUS Fund can support the capture of both fossil and biogenic CO2, while the NECCS Fund will exclusively support the capture of biogenic CO2. Indonesia. Summary and History of Legislation. Indonesia has introduced a comprehensive regulatory framework for CCS and CCUS in upstream oil and natural gas business activities. Regulation includes the rights, obligations, and liabilities of contractors to implement CCS technology in their oil and gas working areas, and the monetization of CCS projects and CCS activities closure. Indonesia aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2060, and CCS is seen as a promising means of reducing carbon emissions to achieve this goal. Furthermore, a presidential regulation allows CCS operators to set aside 30% of their storage capacity for imported CO2.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity Analysis of Regional Greenhouse Gas Driving Effects: An Empirical Study from Southeast Asian Countries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17235951</link>

                Southeast Asia is suffering from extreme weather, and its carbon emissions are increasing rapidly. For efficient emission reduction, clarifying the complex sources behind is necessary. This study takes a new perspective of incorporating multiple GHGs (greenhouse gases) into the same analysis framework, employing the STIRPAT model to dissect the contributions of various socio-economic factors to the emissions of CO2, CH4, and F-gases based on panel data. The analysis reveals that the driving coefficients of total population and urbanization rate are several to 10 times higher than those of other factors and can reach up to 2.98 and 4.715 and are the most significant drivers of GHG emissions in the region. Quadratic per capita GDP shows a significant positive driving effect, indicating that most Southeast Asian countries are unlikely to reach the Kuznets point in current development trajectories. The driving coefficients of F-gases in industrialized countries are significantly higher than those of other GHGs, indicating that their growth rate of F-gases will outpace that of CO2 and CH4. In countries with a similar industrial structure, the driving coefficient of CO2 from the secondary industry is up to 0.183 and down to 0.057, shows the influence of specific sector composition in the secondary industry on emissions. These findings provide critical insights for Southeast Asian policymakers aiming to develop effective climate policies.</description>

      <title>Histological Analysis of the Effect of a Vector Potential Generator on the Femur of a Hindlimb-Suspended Rat</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/anatomia3040023</link>
      <description>Wataru Minamizono, Nao Yashima, Hiroya Matsunaga, Kaoru Fujikawa, Hirai Suito, Takumi Okunuki, Masafumi Ohsako, Anatomia. 3(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404717922

                Disuse osteoporosis occurs due to rest and reduced mechanical stimulation. Under these conditions, bone resorption exceeds bone formation, leading to a decrease in bone density. Vector potential (VP) generators have been developed, and their ability to maintain cartilage thickness has been reported. However, their effects on bone tissue remain unstudied. In this study, experiments were conducted to test the effects of VP on bones that had undergone weight reduction due to hindlimb suspension as a model of disuse osteoporosis. Methods: In this study, 7-week-old male Wistar rats (N = 6 each) were classified into control (CO), hindlimb suspension (HS), and VP energization intervention groups. The tail was used to suspend the HS and VP to remove the load applied to the hindlimbs. The VP conditions were as follows: voltage, 67 mV; frequency, 20 kHz, 0.12 mA; experimental intervention, 30 min/day, 5 days/week, for 3 weeks. At the end of the experimental period, the rats were euthanized with carbon dioxide gas, and histological specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in the femur and analyzed by electron microscopy, bone morphometry, immunohistology, bone fracture testing, and gene expression analysis. Results: HS decreased trabecular bone density and strength. However, VP maintained a significantly higher bone mass than HS, and VP did not differ from CO in bone strength; more osteoclasts were observed on the bone surface in HS, but they were suppressed in VP, and gene expression of CTSK and MMP-9 was decreased. Conclusions: VP suppressed bone resorption by osteoclasts, suggesting that VP is useful in the treatment of disuse osteoporosis.</description>

      <title>Two golf course putting green turfgrass responses to urea nitrogen and nickel</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/its2.161</link>
      <description>Nick Menchyk, Lei Zhu, Hong Luo, Zhigang Li, S. Bruce Martin, Frank Bethea, D. M. Park, International Turfgrass Society research journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404825425

                Abstract Urea is a popular foliar nitrogen (N) source in turfgrass (TG) management. Before urea can be assimilated, it must be hydrolyzed by urease, a nickel (Ni) dependent metalloenzyme, into ammonium and carbon dioxide. Due to the prevalence of urea use in TG management and the low use efficiency associated with N fertility, more research is necessary to improve efficiency of foliar applied N. Two experiments were conducted to examine N metabolism under foliar urea fertility and Ni application of two warm&#8208;season TG species. TifEagle ultradwarf bermudagrass [ Cynodon dactylon (L) Pers. &#215; C. transvaalensis Burtt&#8208;Davy] and Diamond zoysiagrass [ Zoysia matrella (L.) Merr.] were established in solution culture containing three Ni concentrations [Control (tap water), 200, and 400 &#181;g Ni L &#8722;1 ]. Urease activity and amino acid pools were increased under Ni applications, however, an overall decrease in N concentration in leaf tissue was observed over the course of the study. In the second study, TifEagle and Diamond received four Ni concentrations (Control, 400, 800, and 1600 &#181;M supplied as NiCl 2 ) with irrigation to replace evapotranspiration (ET) every 48 h for 6 weeks. The Control turfgrass not receiving Ni had 3 mg kg &#8722;1 Ni concentrations in leaf tissue and no toxicity symptoms. Visual toxicity symptoms and growth reductions were observed in TG receiving 400, 800, and 1600 &#181;M Ni regimes which resulted in leaf tissue Ni concentrations of 101, 227, and 420, respectively. There was a reduction in clipping yields from Diamond and TifEagle receiving 1600 &#181;M Ni compared to Control (24.1% and 32.5%, respectively, p &lt; 0.0001 for both), and a significant linear relationship ( p = 0.004, R 2 = 0.34 and ( p &lt; 0.0001, R 2 = 0.47, respectively) between Ni concentration and clipping yield. Growth and quality of Diamond and TifEagle declined as leaf tissue Ni concentration surpassed 3 mg kg &#8722;1 .</description>

      <title>Eco-mobility: The role of green technologies in shaping the future of transportation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/202414506012</link>
      <description>Denis Ushakov, Khodor Shatila, I. Poliakova, Tatiana Podolskaya, BIO Web of Conferences. 145(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404828601

                The transportation sector contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for nearly 24% of the world&#8217;s CO2 emissions. Green technologies such as electric vehicles (EVs), alternative fuels, and smart infrastructure have emerged as critical tools for reducing the sector&#8217;s environmental impact. This study examines the role of ecological policy support in facilitating the adoption of these green technologies and their subsequent effect on emission reduction. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the study analyzes survey data from 410 respondents across several Asian countries, focusing on the relationships between green technology adoption, environmental policy, and emission reductions. The results demonstrate that ecological policy support acts as both a direct and mediating factor, significantly enhancing the adoption of EVs, alternative fuels, and smart infrastructure, leading to substantial emission reductions. The findings highlight the importance of solid and supportive policies in accelerating the transition to eco-mobility and achieving global climate goals.</description>

      <title>Performance analysis and engineering application of waste rubber crumbs in concrete</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/2053-1591/ad988f</link>
      <description>Li Liu, Materials Research Express. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404797604

                Abstract With the increasing number of waste tires, rubberized concrete, as a sustainable building material, has garnered widespread attention for its performance and environmental benefits. This study utilized KH-570 modified rubber particles to replace ordinary sand in the preparation of concrete, assessing the workability, shrinkage performance, and axial compression characteristics of rubberized concrete, and establishing a stress-strain constitutive model. The research indicates that the introduction of rubber particles enhances the irregularity and roughness of particles within the concrete matrix, leading to increased inter-particle friction and a reduction in workability. Pre-treatment with KH-570 effectively improves workability, particularly when the rubber content is 15%. Rubberized concrete exhibits higher ductility and slower crack propagation rates, with a decrease in elastic modulus and peak stress as rubber content increases, indicating an enhancement in the deformability and toughness of the concrete. The KH-570 pre-treatment partially counteracts this trend and significantly improves the energy absorption capacity of the concrete. The addition of unmodified rubber particles leads to an increased shrinkage rate in concrete, while the surface pre-treatment with KH-570 enhances the adhesion of rubber to the cementitious matrix, mitigating concrete shrinkage. The proposed axial stress-strain constitutive model for rubberized concrete accurately predicts the mechanical characteristics during the transition from elastic to plastic behavior. Rubberized concrete significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions per unit volume, especially in untreated rubberized concrete, and offers better cost-effectiveness. In the construction of airport patrol roads, rubberized concrete demonstrates excellent durability and lower maintenance costs. In summary, rubberized concrete not only improves the ductility and toughness of concrete but also offers significant environmental and economic benefits, making it a promising sustainable building material.&amp;#xD;</description>

      <title>The sustainability impacts of a web&#8208;based outpatient booking application</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/1754-9485.13815</link>

                Abstract Background Climate change is a critical global issue, impacting ecosystems, economies and communities worldwide. The shift from paper&#8208;based to digital systems is becoming increasingly prevalent across industries, with downstream positive impacts on sustainability. In 2020, Austin Health, a public tertiary hospital in Victoria, Australia, adopted a web&#8208;based outpatient booking application, which succeeded the prior paper&#8208;based system. The application served as an integrated platform for administrative staff to access various Austin Information Technology platforms and replaced previous mail&#8208;based outpatient appointment notifications with Short Message Service&#8208;based notifications. This study aimed to assess the environmental impact and organisation&#8208;wide economic cost of a web&#8208;based outpatient booking application compared to the prior paper&#8208;based system across the same time period. Methods A retrospective environmental and economic assessment was conducted for both the web&#8208;based booking application and the paper&#8208;based system. The evaluation covered 36,925 outpatient diagnostic imaging studies &#8211; including CT, MRI, ultrasound and mammography &#8211; performed at Austin Health from 1st July 2023 until 30th June 2024. The environmental impact was assessed by calculating the expected carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions produced by each system. The economic cost analysis was conducted from the perspective of the hospital and included the direct costs of labour and materials/consumables. Results CO 2 e emissions were significantly reduced using the web&#8208;based outpatient booking application compared to the prior paper&#8208;based system (38.5 tonnes compared to 0.002 tonnes), predominantly attributable to the elimination of postage&#8208;related fuel emissions (27.7 tonnes). The estimated net operating cost savings across the year was at least AUD 175,000 (in 2024 Australian Dollars, adjusted for inflation). This was primarily due to labour savings from the elimination of workflow inefficiencies (at least 2342 h saved) amounting to at least AUD 85,272 in salary, followed by savings from eliminated pathology tests (AUD 57,422) and postage costs (AUD 55,193). Conclusion The adoption of the web&#8208;based outpatient booking application led to a substantial reduction in carbon emissions and operating costs, alongside enhanced operational efficiency and productivity. These benefits are anticipated to be enduring, especially in the face of an ever&#8208;increasing demand for medical imaging services.</description>

      <title>A Study on CO&#8322; Emission Reduction Strategies of Coal-Fired Power Plants Based on CCUS-ECBM Source-Sink Matching</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17235983</link>
      <description>Huawei Yang, Pan Zhang, Chenxing Zhang, Peiwen Zhang, Jia Xiaoyan, Energies. 17(23)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404822641

                In order to reduce CO&#8322; emissions from industrial processes, countries have commenced the vigorous development of CCUS (carbon capture, utilization and storage) technology. The high geographical overlap between China&#8217;s extensive coal mining regions and CO2-emitting industrial parks provides an opportunity for the more efficient reduction in CO2 emissions through the development of Enhanced Coal Bed Methane (ECBM) Recovery for use with CCUS technology. Furthermore, the high geographical overlap and proximity of these regions allows for a shift in the transportation mode from pipelines to tanker trucks, which are more cost-effective and logistically advantageous. The issue of transportation must also be considered in order to more accurately assess the constructed cost function and CCUS source&#8211;sink matching model for the implementation of ECBM. The constructed model, when considered in conjunction with the actual situation in Shanxi Province, enables the matching of emission sources and sequestration sinks in the province to be realized through the use of ArcGIS 10.8 software, and the actual transport routes are derived as a result. After analyzing the matching results, it is found that the transportation cost accounts for a relatively small proportion of the total cost. In fact, the CH4 price has a larger impact on the total cost, and a high replacement ratio is not conducive to profitability. When the proportion of CO2 replacing CH4 increases from 1 to 3, the price of CH4 needs to increase from $214.41/t to $643.23/t for sales to be profitable. In addition, electric vehicle transportation costs are lower compared to those of fuel and LNG vehicles, especially for high-mileage and frequent-use scenarios. In order to reduce the total cost, it is recommended to set aside the limitation of transportation distance when matching sources and sinks.</description>

      <title>Carbon-conserving Bioproduction of Malate in an E. coli-based Cell-Free System</title>

                Formate, a biologically accessible form of CO2, has attracted interest as a renewable feedstock for bioproduction. However, its use in microorganisms suffers from toxicity and limited utilization. Approaches are needed to investigate efficient routes for biological formate assimilation. Cell-free systems hold promise due to their potential for efficient use of carbon and energy sources and compatibility with diverse feedstocks. However, bioproduction using purified cell-free systems is limited by costly enzyme purification, whereas lysate-based systems must overcome loss of flux to background reactions in the cell extract. Here, we engineer an E. coli-based system for an eight-enzyme pathway from DNA and incorporate strategies to regenerate cofactors and minimize background reactions. We produce the industrial di-acid malate from glycine, bicarbonate, and formate by engineering the carbon-conserving reductive TCA and formate assimilation pathways. We demonstrate that in situ regeneration of NADH drives metabolic flux towards malate, improving titer by 15-fold. Background reactions can also be reduced 6-fold by diluting the lysate following expression and introducing chemical inhibitors of competing reactions. Together, these results establish a carbon-conserving, lysate-based cell-free platform for malate production, producing 64 &#956;M malate after 8 hours. This system conserves 43% of carbon otherwise lost as CO2 and incorporates 0.13 mol CO2 equivalents/mol glycine fed. Finally, techno-economic analysis of cell-free malate production from formate revealed that the high cost of lysate is a key challenge to the economic feasibility of the process, even assuming efficient cofactor recycling. This work demonstrates the capabilities of cell-free expression systems for both the prototyping of carbon-conserving pathways and the sustainable bioproduction of platform chemicals.</description>

                Motivation: Caffeine, one of the widely used psychoactive substances is known to reduce basal cerebral blood flow (CBF). However, its effect on vasodilatory capacity has not been characterizedGoal(s): To evaluate the impact of Caffein on cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR)Approach: 8 healthy caffeine-na&amp;iuml;ve volunteers were scanned for baseline (pre-caffeine) and post-Caffeine CVR measurements using BOLD MRI and phase-contrast MRI (PC)-MRI during normal air breathing and hypercapnia using 5% CO2 enriched gas mixtureResults: There was a significant reduction in blood-flux (BF) during room-air (p=0.002) and hypercapnia (p=0.0015) post caffeine administration (variation=33.7% and 41.3% respectively). PC-CVR and BOLD-CVR were reduced by 32.7%(p=0.006) and 22.5%(p=0.006) respectivelyImpact: This study's findings provide valuable insights into the impact of caffeine on cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), revealing a significant reduction after caffeine intake. Findings would be beneficial in reducing the inter-subject variability of CVR by improving the sensitivity in detecting abnormalities.</description>

      <title>Multi-centennial climate change in a warming world beyond 2100</title>

      <description>Sun&#8208;Seon Lee, Sahil Sharma, Nan Rosenbloom, Keith B. Rodgers, Ji&#8208;Eun Kim, Eun Young Kwon, Christian Franzke, In&#8208;Won Kim, Mohanan Geethalekshmi Sreeush, Karl Stein, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404775362

                Abstract. Sustained anthropogenic perturbations are anticipated to influence Earth's climate system well beyond the 21st century. Despite growing interest in climate change after 2100 and improved computational resources, multi-century climate projections remain limited in number. Here, we examine a set of 10 ensemble simulations extending the Community Earth System Model 2 large ensemble (CESM2-LE) from 2101 to 2500 under the shared socio-economic pathway (SSP)3-7.0 scenario, which involves the reduction of fossil and industrial CO2 emissions to zero by 2250. By the year 2500, substantial forced changes are projected in both the spatial and temporal characteristics of variability and mean states. Post-2100, El Ni&#241;o-Southern Oscillation variability is expected to diminish, while the tropical intraseasonal variability will notably strengthen. The mean state changes include a global mean temperature rise of 12 &#176;C and a 23.5 % increase in global precipitation compared with historical observations. Additionally, substantial soil carbon release from permafrost thawing is projected over Siberia and Canada, resulting in a shift of land from a carbon sink to a carbon source after the 22nd century. The ocean experiences a rapidly diminished capacity to absorb anthropogenic CO2 after the 21st century, while nevertheless continuing to act as a carbon sink, with an increased contribution from the Southern Ocean to total carbon uptake. The model also projects a considerable decline in low-latitude marine primary production, which is linked to a considerable depletion of PO4 in the local mesopelagic domain. At urban scales, the extended simulations reveal substantial projected changes in the amplitude and phasing of precipitation seasonality, with the same holding for the partial pressure of CO2 in seawater at regional scales, demonstrating that post-2100 changes are not simply amplifications of projected 21st century changes.

      <title>Modelling long-term Greenhouse Gas mitigation pathways for Mongolia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/2515-7620/ad99a8</link>

                Abstract Mongolia&#8217;s faces substantial challenges to reduce its Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions due to a reliance on coal to meet electricity, heat and other energy demand and large livestock emissions. Despite this, Mongolia has committed to reduce GHG emissions by 22.7% in 2030 compared to a baseline emission scenario. Greenhouse gas mitigation assessments for Mongolia have focussed on actions to achieve emission reductions by 2030, but not on the potential for further reduction over the longer-term. This study addresses this gap through the development of long-term (2050) GHG emission pathways for Mongolia. From a technical mitigation potential perspective, these pathways aim to inform what level of GHG reduction targets Mongolia could commit to for the period after its current target expires. Greenhouse gas emissions are quantified for historic years (2010-2019) for all major GHG emitting source sectors, and projected to 2050 based on the population and socioeconomic development outlined in Mongolia&#8217;s Sustainable Development Vision 2050. Finally, mitigation scenarios that model implementation of 49 specific mitigation measures are developed, to quantify their emission reduction potential. Without mitigation, GHG emissions were estimated to increase by 67% and 139% in 2030 and 2050, respectively, compared to 2019 levels (39 million tonnes CO2-eq emissions). Implementation of the 49 mitigation measures could reduce GHG emissions by 40% in 2050 compared to the baseline. This study highlights that post-2030, Mongolia could increase its climate change mitigation ambition. Renewable Electricity generation, and energy efficiency were the measures that could achieve the majority of these additional emission reductions. However, despite the achieve emission reductions in excess of those within current commitments, there remains a substantial gap between the emission reduction potential of technically feasible measures currently being considered in Mongolia&#8217;s climate change mitigation planning, and full decarbonisation.&amp;#xD;</description>

      <title>POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT IN YOGYAKARTA, INDONESIA: A COMPARATIVE STUDY USING LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.37547/tajiir/volume06issue11-22</link>
      <description>Titi Tiara Anasstasia, Tissa Ayu Algary, Andri Perdana, The American Journal of Interdisciplinary Innovations and Research. 6(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404819082

                Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) serves as a tool to estimate the potential impacts of a waste management system. Sleman Regency needs a scenario of waste management with a lower environmental impact. The present study aims to determine the potential impact of the existing business as usual (BAU) waste management practice in Sleman Regency and compare it with several alternatives to waste management strategies. The LCA method was applied following ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards. The impact was assessed using the CML-1A Baseline and ILCD 2011 Midpoint+ methods, along with data from the Ecoinvent database. In the BAU scenario, the impact values observed in every 1 ton of waste managed were Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 4.90E+03 kg CO2 eq, Acidification Potential (ADP) of 2.78E-03 kg SO2 eq, Eutrophication Potential (EP) of 4.92E-02 kg PO4-eq, Human Toxicity Potential (HTP) of 2.06E+01 kg 1.4 DB eq, and Land Use Potential (LUP) of 4.71E+01 kg C deficit. Processing waste into biomass pellets and Refuse Derived Fuel accompanied by waste reduction could decrease the GWP value to 34.04 kg CO2 eq, ADP to 2.96E-06 kg SO2 eq, EP to 7.33E-05 kg PO4-eq, HTP to 3.70E-04 kg 1.4 DB eq, and LUP to 2.11E-03 kg C deficit. The results of waste management with the lowest impact value can serve as a reference for formulating waste management policies in the study area.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of patients who develop atrial fibrillation-induced cardiomyopathy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1136/openhrt-2024-002955</link>
      <description>Nikhil Ahluwalia, Shohreh Honarbakhsh, Hakam Abbass, Abhishek Joshi, Anthony Chow, Mehul Dhinoja, Steffen E. Petersen, Ross J. Hunter, Guy Lloyd, Richard J Schilling, Open Heart. 11(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404828835

                Introduction Atrial fibrillation (AF)-induced cardiomyopathy (AIC) is retrospectively defined after normalisation of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in sinus rhythm. It is unclear why some patients develop AIC. Hypothesis Patients with AIC have a subtle cardiomyopathic process that precedes their AF-mediated LVEF reduction. Detailed assessment of cardiac function after successful catheter ablation will reveal this. Objective To evaluate the utility of measures to identify cardiomyopathic features that persist after LVEF normalisation in AIC. Methods Patients with rate-controlled persistent AF and LVEF&lt;50% undergoing catheter ablation (CA) were prospectively evaluated using echocardiography, cardio-pulmonary exercise testing and serum N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) at baseline and 6 months after CA. Participants with AIC, (LVEF recovery (&#8805;50%) and no other cause for cardiac dysfunction) were evaluated using left ventricular (LV) longitudinal strain and left atrial (LA) reservoir strain (LARS). Changes in peak oxygen consumption and the minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production slope were measured as markers of functional capacity and ventilatory inefficiency. A control group of patients with persistent AF with preserved LVEF were also enrolled. Results 34/41 (82.9%) participants recovered LVEF in sinus rhythm; defined as AIC. NT-proBNP levels were elevated in 18 (52.9%), and 16 reported ongoing heart failure (HF) symptoms. 10 (29.4%) had no improvement in functional capacity, and seven (20.6%) showed persistent ventilatory inefficiency. 20 (58.8%) had impaired global LV longitudinal strain with a relative apical sparing pattern. Nine (26.5%) had impaired LARS. There was an overlap of these abnormalities. 32 (94.1%) demonstrated at least one, 17 (50.0%) having no cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with preserved LVEF during persistent AF had similar demographics but a lower burden of short R-R intervals (&lt;660 ms) on Holter monitoring. Discussion Abnormal structural, metabolic and HF biomarkers are seen in patients with AIC in sinus rhythm. These features may represent a precedent subtle cardiomyopathic process predisposing them to left ventricular systolic dysfunction in AF. Trial registration number NCT04987723 .</description>

      <title>Integrating Cold Thermal Energy Storage for Air Conditioning Demand in a CO2 Refrigeration System at a Supermarket</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17235923</link>

                A common configuration for transcritical CO2 booster systems in supermarkets involves air conditioning (AC) supplied by cooling a water-glycol circuit. The design capacity of the refrigeration unit must handle all refrigeration loads and the AC load during the hottest summer day, leading to overcapacity and part-load operation for most of the year. A proposed design for implementing cold thermal energy storage (CTES) dedicated to AC demand in a supermarket located in the Oslo region is modeled in the object-oriented language Modelica. Simulation results demonstrate an electricity peak power reduction of up to 32.33%. Even though energy savings are not the primary objective of this project, they are achieved by producing and storing energy when the outdoor temperature is lower, and the coefficient of performance (COP) of the system is higher. The energy savings can reach up to 11.8%. Finally, the economic benefits of the system are assessed under the spot pricing system, revealing potential electricity cost savings of up to 12.56%.</description>

                Abstract Heating accounts for significant primary resource consumption and generation up to 30 % of total GHG emissions in the EU27. The ambitious emissions reduction goals outlined in the European Green Deal and Fit for 55 package necessitate not only the massive renovation of building stocks, but also reconstruction of heat generation and supply systems. With 76 % of the EU building stock located in urban areas, the renewal of urban heating systems is crucial. An easy-to-use methodology has been developed for managing long-term renovation programmes and regularly assessing renovation projects, thereby forming a comprehensive dynamic vision on the progress. This methodology enables flexible, rapid and, at the same time, sufficiently accurate and objective analysis of the potential and benefits of various heating system renovation projects and their variants at the pre-design stage, as well as their comparison according to efficiency. It employs a limited number of open indicators and does not require specialised knowledge in thermal physics, economics and/or construction. The developed methodology provides insights into (1) achievable heat consumption and primary energy savings, (2) reduction of dominant CO2 emissions, (3) changes in heating tariffs and costs, and (4) required investments. The methodology is intended for use by: (1) municipalities to streamline sustainable planning and management of urban heating systems and to facilitate interaction with owners of buildings and local heating systems, and (2) national authorities monitoring the implementation of national programmes under Fit for 55 .</description>

      <title>Isolated High-Gain DC-DC Converter with Nanocrystalline-Core Transformer: Achieving 1:16 Voltage Boost for Renewable Energy Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/technologies12120246</link>
      <description>Tania Elizabeth Sandoval Valencia, Dante Ruiz-Robles, Jorge Ort&#237;z-Mar&#237;n, Jesus Alejandro Franco, Quetzalc&#243;atl Hern&#225;ndez-Escobedo, Edgar L. Moreno&#8208;Goytia, Technologies. 12(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404759042

                This paper presents an isolated DC-DC converter with high voltage gain that features an advanced inter-built nanocrystalline-core medium-frequency transformer (NC-MFT). The isolated DC-DC converter with an NC-MFT is specifically designed for applications such as interconnect photovoltaic (PV) systems, DC microgrids, DC loads, and DC buses, where voltage gain is one of the essential issues to consider. The NC-MFT inside the DC-DC converter is designed with a new approach that not only provides isolation but also contributes to achieving high efficiency and a higher step-up ratio. The high efficiency of the converters contributes to the integration of PV systems into DC microgrids. The converter yields a high voltage conversion ratio of 16.17. The experimental results obtained at 41.8 V/676 V and 275 W for the prototype revealed high efficiency (95.63% at full load). The experimental results validate the theoretical analysis and simulation, confirming that the converter achieves the main objective of high voltage conversion and high efficiency. These results will contribute to the interest in the use of this type of energy and its impact on the reduction in CO2 emissions.</description>

      <title>Development of a Forecasting Framework Based on Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms for Greenhouse Gas Emissions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/systems12120528</link>

                The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, in order to effectively address the issue of climate change, has critical importance worldwide. To achieve this aim and implement the necessary strategies and policies, the projection of greenhouse gas emissions is essential. This paper presents a forecasting framework for greenhouse gas emissions based on advanced machine learning algorithms: multivariable linear regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbor, extreme gradient boosting, support vector, and multilayer perceptron regression algorithms. The algorithms employ several input variables associated with greenhouse gas emission outputs. In order to evaluate the applicability and performance of the developed framework, nationwide statistical data from Turkey are employed as a case study. The dataset of the case study includes six input variables and annual sectoral and total greenhouse gas emissions in CO2 eq. as output variables. This paper provides a scenario-based approach for future forecasts of greenhouse gas emissions and a sector-based analysis of greenhouse gas emissions in the case country considering multiple input variables. The present study indicates that the stated machine learning algorithms can be successfully applied to the forecasting of greenhouse gas emissions.</description>

                Chemical weed control is a significant agricultural concern, and reliance on a limited range of herbicide action modes has increased resistant weed species, many of which use C4 metabolism. As a result, the identification of novel herbicidal agents with low toxicity targeting C4 plants becomes imperative. An assessment was conducted on the impact of 3-cyanobenzoic acid on the growth and photosynthetic processes of maize (Zea mays), a representative C4 plant, cultivated hydroponically over 14 days. The results showed a significant reduction in plant growth and notable disruptions in gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence due to the application of 3-cyanobenzoic acid, indicating compromised photosynthetic activity. Parameters such as the chlorophyll index, net assimilation (A), stomatal conductance (gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), maximum effective photochemical efficiency (Fv&amp;#039;/Fm&amp;#039;), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), quantum yield of photosystem II photochemistry (&#981;PSII), and electron transport rate through PSII (ETR) all decreased. The A/PAR curve revealed reductions in the maximum net assimilation rate (Amax) and apparent quantum yield (&#981;), alongside an increased light-compensation point (LCP). Moreover, 3-cyanobenzoic acid significantly decreased the carboxylation rates of RuBisCo (Vcmax) and PEPCase (Vpmax), electron transport rate (J), and mesophilic conductance (gm). Overall, 3-cyanobenzoic acid induced substantial changes in plant growth, carboxylative processes and photochemical activities. The treated plants also exhibited heightened susceptibility to intense light conditions, indicating a significant and potentially adverse impact on their physiological functions. These findings suggest that 3-cyanobenzoic acid or its analogs could be promising for future research targeting photosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Lower Carbon Footprint Production in SAGD Late Life Recovery</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/223126-ms</link>
      <description>Ismarullizam Mohd Ismail, Peter S. Guilfoyle, E. Gisholt, Jos&#233;-Luis Molina, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404894866

                Abstract The world needs reliable energy. As an industry, we supply that energy. Moreover, our product is one of the major contributors to increasing atmospheric CO2. Steam assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) technique alone contributes nearly 1.4 million barrels per day of oil production but with a range of steam oil ratios, the effectiveness of this production method is often challenged and seen as having high associated GHG emissions per barrel. We cannot solve this dilemma, but by better understanding the sciences of the reservoir and implementing new technologies at the primary level of production, we can help to be part of the solution. One production enhancement technique, injecting NCG at the late life SAGD wind down process is an effective but challenging operation due to high mobility of the gas and subsequent breakthrough at the production well. A new design of Autonomous inflow control valve's (AICV) can distinguish the difference in viscosity of the fluid, and therefore they can strongly choke and shut the NCG effluents zones as breakthrough occurs in the SAGD production well. The AICV design is truly autonomous based on Hagen-Poiseuille equation and Bernoulli's principle. The AICV is utilizing the difference in flow behavior in a laminar flow restrictor and a turbulent flow restrictor to differentiate fluids based on the difference in pressure drop between oil, water, emulsions, gas, CO2 and steam. This will allow the AICV to choke and/or shut off unwanted water, gas, CO2 and steam coming into the producer well. To understand the AICV behavior for a NCG breakthrough application, a laboratory experiment which illustrate the performance of AICV technology and reference orifice type ICD technology have been conducted. Laboratory experiment results illustrate the performance difference between AICV technology and reference orifice type ICD technology illustrate a significant, of more than 80% reduction, in NCG choking performance, when compared to the ICD type nozzle. The laboratory test performance results are used in reservoir simulations. Reservoir simulation results show that utilizing AICV in late life SAGD production well can significantly reduce NCG production and improve the recovery of SAGD operation by retaining more of the injected gas within the reservoir. In today's engineer's toolbox, a variety of new technologies exist that can help achieve the targets for late life SAGD. The new editions to Flow Control Device (FCD), Autonomous Inflow Control Valve (AICV), has evolved to the point that operators can operate in late life in a way that could demonstrate clear economic efficiencies with a reduced environmental impact. Reducing NCG breakthrough, greatly improves the economics and reduce greenhouse gas emissions for each barrel of oil produced thus reducing the carbon footprint and the impact to late life SAGD operation.</description>

      <title>The Javeriana Cali&#8217; Strategic Plan for the Sustainable Management: An Example of How to Implement, Disseminate and Evaluate Sustainability Policies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.14710/jsp.2024.25044</link>
      <description>Isabella Tello, Jos&#233; Aguilar, Journal of Sustainability Perspectives. 4(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404767123

                In order to organize the multiple actions the Universidad Javeriana had been developing for the sustainable management of its campus, a strategic plan was structured. The plan is structured in five major programs: water resources, energy, biodiversity, recycling and reduction of CO2 emissions. For the definition of these five programs we were inspired by the contributions of the thematic structure of Green Metrics, the recommendations of the Encyclical Laudato Si and the SDGs. In turn, each program is broken down into sub-programs, projects and sub-projects. Each program also includes cross-cutting strategies articulated in sub-programs which are broken down into research projects, semester projects, graduate work and theses. Also, sub-programs for disseminating initiatives and entrepreneurship are considered. The planning instrument is taken to the detail of operational planning, using the Gantt Chart. A team coordinates the coordination of the different programs and meets weekly to review its progress. The plan was presented and approved to the University's Steering Committee, and the document has been incorporated into the University's Strategic Plan. It is also being used to link professors from civil engineering, electronics and architecture careers who invite students to carry out semester or degree work on topics that strengthen campus execution.</description>

      <title>Auriferous Fluid Evolution and the Role of Carbonaceous Matter in a Saddle&#8208;Reef Gold Deposit: Dufferin Deposit, Meguma Terrane, Nova Scotia, Canada</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2024gc011861</link>
      <description>Mitchell J. Kerr, Jacob J. Hanley, Daniel J. Kontak, Preetysha Ramlochund, Zolt&#225;n Zajacz, Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems. 25(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404863416

                Abstract The metaturbidite&#8208;hosted, &#8764;380 Ma Dufferin gold deposit, Meguma terrane, northeastern Appalachian Orogen (Nova Scotia, Canada) is an orogenic gold deposit with mineralized saddle reef&#8208;type quartz veins hosted by metasandstones and black slates in a tightly folded anticline. Together with native gold inclusions, genetically related hydrothermal carbonaceous material (CM) in veins occurs as pyrobitumen in cavities and along fractures/grain boundaries proximal to vein contacts and wallrock fragments. Integrating several microanalytical methods we document the precipitation of gold via coupled fluid&#8208; f O 2 reduction (via interaction with CM) and pH increase. These changes in fluid chemistry destabilized gold bisulfide complexes, leading to efficient Au precipitation from a gold&#8208;undersaturated (0.045 &#177; 0.024 ppm Au; 1&#963;; n = 58 fluid inclusions) aqueous&#8208;carbonic fluid (H 2 O&#8208;NaCl&#8208;CO 2 &#177; N 2 &#177; CH 4 ). The proposed mineralization mechanism is supported by: (a) a complementary decrease in Au and redox&#8208;sensitive semimetals (As, Sb), and increase in wall rock&#8208;derived elements (i.e., Mg, K, Ca, Sr, Fe) concentrations in fluid inclusions with time; (b) a corresponding decrease in the X CO2 , consistent with CO 2 removal via reduction/respeciation and late carbonate precipitation; and (c) gold embedding in, or on, the surface of CM inside mineralized cavities and fractures. Despite mineralizing fluids transporting low concentrations of Au far from saturation, precipitation of gold was locally evidently high where such fluids interacted with CM, contributing to the overall gold endowment of Meguma deposits. This work re&#8208;emphasizes CM as a potential prerequisite for efficient gold precipitation within the overall genetic model for similar orogenic metasedimentary settings globally where the presence and/or role of CM has been documented.</description>

                The present study explores incorporating biodiesel made from sunflower waste cooking oil (SWO) into petroleum diesel in varying concentrations. It examines various aspects, including energy, exergy, emissions, exergoeconomic and enviroeconomic factors, and the sustainability index (SI). Experimental findings indicate that higher biodiesel proportions in blends decrease thermal efficiency (&#951;th). Notably, D90WB10 (90% diesel and 10% biodiesel) demonstrates superior &#951;th, ranging from 14.98 to 29.37% across loads, closely resembling diesel (D100) values. Blends show significant reductions in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions (by 10.59&#8211;48.23%) and in unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) emissions (by 10.34&#8211;27.58%) compared to D100 at full engine load. D90WB10 exhibits a maximum exergy efficiency of 27.22% at full load among all blends. Better exergoeconomic efficient fuel is indicated by lower relative cost difference (CR). Among all tested fuels, D100 exhibits the lowest CR value of 2.21. D100 exhibits the least annual CO2 emissions cost, whereas pure biodiesel (WB100) shows the highest, ranging from 55.46 to 144.86 USD/year across loads. The SI values for all tested fuels range between 1.281 and 1.393 at full engine load. Results indicate that blends of SWO biodiesel and diesel, particularly D90WB10, offer promising performance akin to diesel without significant modification.</description>

                Climate change has gained prominence following the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius, with efforts to keep it under 1.5 degrees Celsius. This agreement stresses the importance of collective action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience against climate impacts. In June 2023, the global average surface temperature reached a record high, with subsequent months also setting heat records. Mitigating global warming's adverse effects, such as rising temperatures and extreme weather changes, requires significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Efforts in the energy sector have led to a decrease in CO2 emissions from 40.6 million tons in 2018 to 127.67 million tons in 2023. These efforts include enhancing energy efficiency, transitioning to renewable energy, and implementing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies In Indonesia, CCS regulations are outlined in Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation No. 2 of 2023. CCS involves the capture, transport, injection, and permanent storage of carbon emissions. The management of state-owned assets related to CCS falls under the Ministry of Finance Regulation No. 140/PMK.06/2020, which addresses the transfer, utilization, and valuation of upstream oil and gas assets. This paper discusses the role of state asset management in the implementation of CCS in Indonesia, examining current regulations, challenges, and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Research on Sealing Premium Connections in Corrosive CO2 Environments</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12122680</link>
      <description>Yinping Cao, Pengsheng Gu, Yu Yang, Yihua Dou, Processes. 12(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404826980

                To investigate corrosion and resulting changes in the sealing performance of premium connections in corrosive CO2 environments, we carried out a simulation analysis of their secondary current distribution and structural mechanics based on multi-physics field coupling. A finite element calculation model of &#1060;88.9 mm &#215; 6.45 mm taper&#8211;taper premium connections (steel grade P110) was established using COMSOL6.0 general software. By analyzing corrosion laws under different environmental parameters, five internal pressures and tensile displacements were set. We simulated premium connections under different operating conditions using a secondary current distribution module. To investigate the distribution of the corrosion current density in premium connections under different operating conditions, the sealing performance before and after corrosion was quantitatively evaluated using a seal strength index. The results show that the current density is higher at the torque shoulder of the premium connections, which is more susceptible to damage. As the internal pressure increases, the current density in the inner wall of the column increases, and on the threads, the current density is highest at the rounded corners of the root of the thread, which is also more likely to be damaged. Under different internal pressures, although the sealing strength of the premium connections meets the sealing criterion, the corroded ones show a significant reduction in sealing performance. The results of this study provide a reliable theoretical basis for research on sealing premium connections in corrosive environments.</description>

      <description>Ajmal Khan, Shams Rahman, Farman Ullah, Muhammad Ilyas Khattak, Mohammed M. Bait&#8208;Suwailam, Hesham El&#8208;Sayed, PeerJ Computer Science. 10(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404861506

                Traffic congestion is a growing concern in urban centers worldwide, leading to significant delays, particularly for emergency vehicles such as fire trucks and ambulances. This not only increases emergency response time but also the risk of life and property loss. To address this issue, our research introduces a traffic control system that prioritizes emergency vehicle egress and mitigates intersection congestion. Other than validation through simulation, the system&#8217;s efficacy is further substantiated by real-world hardware implementation. The system employs an access point (AP) at intersections to receive location and direction data from approaching vehicles. Emergency vehicles are given precedence, while non- emergency vehicle data is used to adjust traffic light durations, thereby optimizing the traffic flow. The simulation results demonstrate the system&#8217;s reduced lane opening times and average waiting periods for emergency vehicles. Advancing from simulation to application, we have executed a real-world hardware validation at a high-traffic intersection. This phase entailed the precise installation and calibration of the necessary hardware components, transitioning from theoretical models to practical, operational technology. The hardware setup confirms the system&#8217;s practical viability and offers a more comprehensive assessment of its impact on traffic efficiency and emergency response times. This dual approach of simulation and hardware validation provides a thorough evaluation of the system&#8217;s capabilities, establishing a foundation for future traffic management solutions. Additionally, the implementation of the system leads to a notable reduction in CO2 emissions at intersections, contributing to environmental sustainability efforts.</description>

      <description>Alysha T. Bogard, Andrew Q. Tan, The Journal of Physiology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404841515

                We thank Panza et al. (2024) for their interest in our work (Bogard et al., 2023) and the editors for fostering this dialogue on the effects of acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) on motor learning and metabolic cost. We hope this ongoing exchange continues to advance our understanding of how AIH enhances human motor performance. Below, we address the key points raised by Panza et al. (2024), including our statistical approach, potential mechanisms behind metabolic adaptations and future directions for optimizing AIH protocols. Panza et al. (2024) raised concerns regarding our use of post hoc analyses without significant group or interaction effects. We argue that within-group post hoc analyses are warranted when a significant main effect, such as a learning phase, is observed. These analyses are essential for identifying phase-dependent changes that might otherwise be overlooked. During split-belt walking, features of spatiotemporal co-ordination (Buurke et al., 2022; Leech et al., 2018), walking kinetics (Mawase et al., 2013; Ogawa et al., 2014; Sombric &amp; Torres-Oviedo, 2020) and net metabolic power (Finley et al., 2013; S&#225;nchez et al., 2017, 2021) adapt on different timescales. Moreover, initial asymmetry (Malone &amp; Bastian, 2014) and the degree of asymmetry (Leech et al., 2018) are important predictors of the magnitude of spatiotemporal adaptation. Without within-group analyses, phase-dependent improvements could be missed, particularly during these initial learning phases when motor patterns are more variable. Furthermore, although larger sample sizes would increase sensitivity to detect interaction effects, our observation of significant group effects and greater within-AIH group changes suggests that the AIH group exhibited more substantial alterations in both walking mechanics and net metabolic power. The relationship between walking mechanics and metabolic adaptations during motor learning is incompletely understood (Finley et al., 2013; S&#225;nchez et al., 2017, 2019) because net metabolic power continues to decrease even after spatiotemporal co-ordination plateaus during prolonged split-belt walking (S&#225;nchez et al., 2021). We agree with Panza et al. (2024) that correlational analyses between motor and metabolic outcomes would be valuable. Our subsequent analyses revealed a positive correlation between reduced net metabolic power and spatiotemporal asymmetry during both motor learning and motor savings (Fig. 1) (Bogard, Hembree, et al., 2024). Although these correlations were significant (P &lt; 0.05), it is important to note that biomechanical adaptations alone may not fully explain changes in net metabolic power. Panza et al. (2024) proposed that mitochondrial adaptations might underlie the observed reductions in net metabolic power post-AIH. Because reductions in net metabolic power following AIH had not been previously reported, our study was not designed to examine specific mechanisms such as mitochondrial function. To comprehensively address this hypothesis, future mechanistic studies should be conducted without the confounds of split-belt locomotor adaptation. Determining the 'optimal' dose of AIH remains another critical area for future research. Panza et al. (2024) questioned the intensity of hypoxia in our study, noting that our nadir oxygen saturation ( S p O 2 ${{S}_{{\mathrm{p}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}}}$ ) values (65.4 &#177; 4.7%) were lower than other studies. Notably, our protocol utilized 90 s hypoxic bouts, consistent with prior work showing improvements in motor function after incomplete spinal cord injury (Hayes et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2021; Trumbower et al., 2012). This methodological difference may explain the lower S p O 2 ${{S}_{{\mathrm{p}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}}}$ values compared to studies that utilized 60 s hypoxic bouts (Christiansen et al., 2018; Finn et al., 2022). It is also important to clarify that we reported the lowest S p O 2 ${{S}_{{\mathrm{p}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}}}$ attained during a single AIH session, not the average SpO&#8322; across the 15 hypoxic cycles; for example, average S p O 2 ${{S}_{{\mathrm{p}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}}}$ of 81% in Christiansen et al. (2018). Furthermore, our study was conducted at a higher altitude in Boulder, Colorado, compared to the near-sea-level locations of previous studies, such as Chicago, Illinois (Christiansen et al., 2018) and Sydney, Australia (Finn et al., 2022). Although we utilized a validated low-oxygen air generator to deliver 9% O2 (Tan et al., 2020), the reduced atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes may further increase the hypoxic burden, driving the observed response (Panza et al., 2023). Importantly, lower nadir S p O 2 ${{S}_{{\mathrm{p}}{{{\mathrm{O}}}_{\mathrm{2}}}}}$ levels in our study did not elicit adverse effects and were effective in enhancing motor learning and metabolic efficiency. Another point raised was whether hypercapnia could further enhance motor plasticity. Prior studies indicate that maintaining CO2 levels at (Vermeulen et al., 2020) or above baseline (Tester et al., 2014) is important for facilitating phrenic long-term facilitation (Welch et al., 2022). Rodent studies show that AIH induces plasticity through serotonin-dependent 5HT2A receptor pathways (Bach &amp; Mitchell, 1996; Baker-Herman et al., 2004). Notably, 5HT2A receptors also mediate CO2-induced arousal (Buchanan et al., 2015). Thus, hypercapnic AIH may stimulate central chemoreceptors more effectively, thereby enhancing 5HT release (Welch, 2021). However, the broader application of hypercapnic AIH to non-respiratory motor systems remains unclear. Poikilocapnic AIH has been effective in improving walking performance after incomplete spinal cord injury (Hayes et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2021; Trumbower et al., 2012) and improving motor learning (Bogard et al., 2023) and performance fatigability (Bogard, Pollet, et al., 2024) in able-bodied individuals. Unlike respiratory plasticity (Puri et al., 2021), other non-respiratory motor plasticity does not appear to depend on CO2. Nevertheless, we agree that examining the effects of hypercapnic AIH on motor outcomes is a necessary next step. Standardizing AIH dosing may be essential for comparing responses across multiple sites, advancing our understanding of its effects on motor performance and its interaction with rehabilitation training. Considerable variability exists in how AIH protocols are applied across studies, including duty cycle and total number of sessions, all of which probably influence motor outcomes. Reporting end-tidal O2 as a readout of hypoxic intensity could enhance reproducibility. Future research should systematically examine these dosing parameters and their effects on human motor performance. Once again, we appreciate the careful review of our work by Panza et al. (2024) and the opportunity to contribute to this important discussion.

      <title>The Fossil Fuel Fa&#231;ade</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5204/mcj.3120</link>
      <description>Robyn Gulliver, M/C Journal. 27(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404730894

                Introduction Our era of urgent climate action is underpinned by a perplexing paradox: a continued reliance on fossil fuels is presented as a solution to the very crisis it perpetuates. We live in a world where this logical inconsistency is normalised and accepted; an artificial fantasy realm where we can have our fossil fuel cake and eat it as well. In this realm, society, business, and government acknowledge the reality of climate change and its cause, yet do little to alleviate it. Instead, they express bi-partisan support for zero emissions targets while expanding fossil fuel projects, and promote corporate decarbonisation pledges while advocating against legislation reducing greenhouse gas emissions. They celebrate manipulated emissions reduction data while pushing aside the reality of rapidly breaking heat records (UN News) and decades of locked-in continuous emissions increases (Bhatia) through unabated approvals of coal and gas mines (Roe and Lowrey). Our ability to construct and sustain artificial worlds is nothing new, having long featured in philosophical discourse. From Plato's Allegory of the Cave&#8212;where prisoners mistake shadows for reality&#8212;to modern conspiracy theories, people have long explored and exploited the notion that our understanding of the world has flexible epistemological foundations which can be easily manipulated. Modern scholars have expanded this analysis to a societal scale. For example, Jean Baudrillard explored how media and symbols can create a 'hyperreality' that obscures or replaces objective truth (Wolny), while Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman analysed the mechanisms of 'manufacturing consent', whereby public opinion is carefully curated to align with specific interests (Chomsky and Herman). Through our growing immersion in online communities, networks of power work to create epistemic bubbles and echo chambers. Information is curated to reinforce existing beliefs and exclude contradictory evidence, leveraging our tendency to reject information that does not align with our beliefs. These blurred lines of the fossil-fuelled artificial reality can be difficult to discern given the entrenched role these resources play in our society. Australia is one of the world&#8217;s largest fossil fuel exporters, with one of the highest carbon emissions per capita (Grant and Hare). Fossil fuels hold a central place in the Australian economy, community, and psyche (Botrel et al.). The pervasive grip of the fossil fuel industry compels our continued consumption regardless of climate concerns while offering few pathways for escape. This creates a profound cognitive dissonance: we must simultaneously acknowledge climate change while participating in the very systems that accelerate it. Not only that: in managing this psychological tension, we acquiesce to the industry&#8217;s preferred narrative of an ongoing fossil-fuelled future (Wright et al.). In this mythical future, fossil fuel expansion will bring unbridled collective goods so long as we sweep away any inconvenient concerns about climate change from our thoughts. In doing so, the direct link between fossil fuel production and carbon emissions is severed: rendered trivial, eclipsed by the carefully constructed myth of fossil fuel dependence. And thus a new world comes into existence, one where the use of fossil fuels becomes both necessary and inevitable. In this article, I explore the many channels by which the fossil fuel industry has constructed this artificial reality. I draw on parallels between the tactics employed by the fossil fuel industry and those previously used by other health- and planet-harming industries, particularly the tobacco industry (Lacy-Nichols et al.). Using data compiled from a comprehensive longitudinal database of state and federal lobbying registers, combined with online and archival sources, the following sections explore how the industry and its enablers wield these strategies to perpetuate this artificial reality. The Construction of the Artificial Fossil-Fuelled World Strategy 1: Constructing and Controlling the Narrative Sustaining this artificial reality requires narratives that mask fossil fuels' climate destruction. A veneer of plausibility justifies acceptance of this reality, making it crucial for the industry to control the narrative of its societal role. Accordingly, industry-favoured solutions&#8212;such as carbon capture and storage&#8212;are framed as 'common sense' (Parkin). Mirroring Gramsci&#8217;s concept of "cultural hegemony", this pro-fossil fuel ideology is perpetuated through the extensive material, organisational, and communicative power of the industry, allowing it to be accepted as natural and inevitable (Blondeel). These resources fuel the small army of PR firms, lobbyists, think tanks, and 'junk scientists', who all play various roles in customising narratives for different audiences in a way that is most likely to maintain this artificial reality, as described below (Hoggan and Littlemore). Promoting gas as a transition fuel. The idea of a &#8216;transition&#8217; fuel has been highly effective in neutralising threats to fossil fuel extraction as well as renewable energy challenges (Heras 49). Through dedicated websites and industry reports like "Gas Vision 2050" the industry reframes gas as a climate solution while avoiding direct discussion of its climate impacts. This extends to misleading claims; the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) framed gas as 50% cleaner than an unspecified alternative fuel, in claims subsequently found to have breached environmental advertising codes (Ad Standards Community Panel). Sowing doubt from denial to delay. Despite knowing about climate change since the 1960s, companies like Exxon Mobile promoted scepticism for decades (Bennett). Today, this narrative has now shifted from denial to delay (Hoggan and Littlemore). The industry acknowledges climate change while claiming its fossil fuel expansion serves the public good. Net zero targets are one particularly prominent narrative of delay: companies promote targets to postpone meaningful action while maintaining an appearance of progress (e.g., APPEA's rebranding to Australian Energy Producers). Another example is natural gas company Tamboran Resources, which mirrors this narrative in front-page claims about their net zero vision, despite its role in the controversial Beetaloo fracking project set to emit more greenhouse gases than all Pacific Island nations combined (Ogge, Emissions). Emphasising economic benefits. The fossil fuel industry maintains legitimacy by emphasising economic benefits and jobs (Bryson). Both major political parties adhere to this framing, enabling fossil fuel expansion to continue unabated while the role of other industries in providing jobs&#8212;such as renewable energy and tourism in the Great Barrier Reef&#8212;gains little space in the narrative (Bryson). Companies like Origin Energy promote direct benefits to landowners as &#8220;a valuable addition to farm income&#8221; (Origin Energy), aligning themselves with economic growth, stability, and the broader national interest while downplaying their role in climate-related disasters (Wright et al.). Capturing the media. Media outlets play a crucial role in reinforcing fossil fuel narratives. Some, like the West Australian, openly support the industry and attack climate initiatives (Dumas). More broadly, media outlets perpetuate the connection between fossil fuels and economic wellbeing, while overstating the industry's employment significance relative to environmental concerns (Nyberg and Wright). Strategy 2: Camouflaging and Greenwashing The second strategy used to maintain this artificial reality is camouflaging and greenwashing. These mechanisms actively work to disguise the industry's harmful impacts and present a deceptively eco-friendly image. They construct a picture of corporate virtue, allow destructive companies to deflect criticism, position themselves as solution providers, and act as mouthpieces for industry (Lacy-Nichols et al.). Fossil fuel companies seek to promote their public role through partnerships in the public sector, while sponsorship and advertising help deflect attention from emissions and minimise criticism (Nyberg and Wright; Plec and Pettenger). Three examples of camouflaging and greenwashing are presented below. Promoting front groups. The Climate Leaders Coalition has 47 members each paying around $3000 a year to join and claim their title as a climate leader (Fernyhough; Climate Leaders Coalition, "About"). Members of the group include major gas producers Santos and Woodside, who ostensibly agree with the statement "We take climate change seriously in our business" (Climate Leaders Coalition, "About"). This group is used as a way to overlay a fake climate lens to climate emissions, with Santos even earning its own climate case study in the 2020 Roadmap to Zero report (Climate Leaders Coalition, Roadmap). Fostering public-private partnerships. The Queensland Resources Council highlighted partnerships between Arrow Energy, Moranbah State High School, and Simply Sunshine Day Care (Queensland Resources Council), while Santos provided funding to Queensland police, regional councils, health committees, and government departments (Santos). Similarly, the Australian Earth Science Education Group is supported by Woodside, Santos, and Chevron, and promotes gas-positive education to children in Years 4-10 (AusEarthEd). Sponsorship and advertising. The Australian Institute of Marine Science, despite its goal of supporting sustainable use and protection of oceans, is sponsored by BHP, Santos, Shell, and Woodside (Australian Institute of Marine Science, "World&#8217;s"; Australian Institute of Marine Science, "Industry"). Fossil fuel companies advertise and sponsor sporting venues like the Canberra Tennis Arena (Rimmer), while hundreds of health, community, and education organisations receive sponsorship from energy companies. Major initiatives like Bright-r invest $750 million in community projects (Bright-r), while partnerships with state governments, like Western Australia&#8217;s Resources Community Investment Initiative, further legitimise the industry. Collectively they create a discourse of community wellbeing, supported by actors across industry, politics, and the media (Wright et al.). Strategy 3: Influencing Public Policy and Research Narrative control alone does not maintain fossil fuel dominance. Instead, "petro-hegemony" describes how companies gain deeper political and economic control through lobbying, undermining science, and funding climate denial (LeQuesne 19; Parkin). Fossil fuel interests are crafted to appear synonymous with democratic governance (LeQuesne), enabling them to counter climate policies that threaten their business model (B&#246;hler et al.). In this "carbon democracy" (LeQuesne), historical links between coal and politics give lobbyists significant policy influence, turning modest economic gains into remarkable political power (Baer 199). As demonstrated below, the industry's extensive financial resources allow for persistent lobbying that climate advocates cannot match (Botrel et al.) often resulting in business-friendly policy outcomes (Meng and Rode). Lobbying. Major gas companies have been shown to engage in "predatory lobbying" to secure investments and influence policy (ACCR). This lobbying also involves developing alternatives to public policy, usually promoting options such as fast-tracking projects, tax breaks, self-regulation, or voluntary commitments. Industry bodies promote self-regulation and reduced climate reporting (EY; Minerals Council of Australia). The revolving door between politics and industry has been demonstrated to have influenced major projects (Lucas) and sought preferential treatment for certain companies such as Beach Energy, Sibelco, and Linc Energy (Aulby and Ogge). These lobbying efforts often emphasise decarbonisation risks to communities and employment, while highlighting the industry's economic contributions (Wright et al.; Minerals Council of Australia). Undermining legitimate science. The distortion of evidence and exaggeration of uncertainty is a well-established tactic to neutralise threats to business models (Lacy-Nichols et al.). The Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance (GISERA) exemplifies this approach: funded 75% by gas companies and overseen by industry executives (Ogge, GISERA; Australia Institute, &#8220;CSIRO&#8221;; Bambrick et al.), GISERA has been accused of publishing biased reports, such as claiming fracking was environmentally safe based on a limited sample of just six out of Queensland's 19,000 coal seam gas wells, and conducting surveys that inflate apparent support for coal seam gas projects (Australia Institute, &#8220;CSIRO&#8221;; Lock the Gate). Meanwhile, a 2010 Australian Research Council project on CSG health risks was reportedly not undertaken due to the industry partner, Santos, withdrawing funding (McCarron). Strategy 4: Leveraging State Power The alliance between state power and fossil fuel interests combines financial support with dissent suppression, protecting industry interests while maintaining the narrative that fossil fuels are essential for national prosperity. State support for expansion alongside suppression of protection as described below, makes it increasingly difficult for sustainable energy alternatives to gain public traction. Providing government support. State power actively supports fossil fuel expansion (e.g., see Nyberg and Wright), such as Queensland's backing of the Carmichael coal mine despite market doubts (Bryson). State support can be linked to political donations, as suggested by donations to the Western Australia Labor Party by Mineral Resources and Woodside during consideration of increasing gas export allowances (Readfearn). Financial support to the sector is also provided through the estimated A$14.5b annual cost to the state for various fossil fuel subsidies (Australia Institute, "Fossil"). Criminalising protest. Governments and corporations leverage state power to suppress, protest, and convert political communication practices into offences (Gulliver et al., "Criminalisation"). These include new anti-protest laws, expanded applications of existing discretionary powers, and portraying protesters as extremists (Brock et al.; Irwin et al.). Companies also use private security, strategic lawsuits, and surveillance, as well as attempting to remove environmental organisations' charitable status (Al-Azzawi et al.; Hoggan and Littlemore; Kirkwood). Our Shared Duplicity: Moral Disengagement and Identity Capture While personal choices offer accessible forms of dissent, a focus on individual responsibility to reduce individual emissions serves industry interests by deflecting attention from their role in perpetuating fossil fuel dependence. Two key psychological responses emerge to maintain fossil fuel control: moral disengagement and identity capture, both of which may help individuals cope with but ultimately reinforce the status quo. Moral disengagement. The ubiquitous influence wielded by the fossil fuel industry only succeeds because of societal acceptance of fossil fuel norms (Blondeel). These norms are often at their most visible amongst those who work in environmentally destructive industries where employees justify carbon impacts through various strategies: by emphasising the positive outcomes as opposed to the negative influence of their efforts, through promoting gradual change or relying on future solutions, and by dismissing carbon data (Torres-Delgado et al. 1). Identity capture. Simultaneously, climate change beliefs have become deeply tied to personal identity, with stronger identity attachments increasing resistance to change (Marquart-Pyatt et al.). Climate change beliefs are also substantially linked to, and constrained by, political affiliation (Hornsey et al.; Fielding et al.). This identity capture extends to professional spheres, as evidenced by Arctic tourism operators who morally disengage from their environmental impacts while portraying activities as sustainable (Vespestad et al.). Dismantling the Artificial World The industry gains popular consent by normalising the entrenched role of fossil fuels in our lives and rigorously challenging threats that question the assumptions, beliefs, and patterns that maintain these prevailing norms (Blondeel). However, history demonstrates that social movements offer a powerful mechanism for effectively challenging the status quo. Environmental movements constitute a counter-hegemonic force, mobilising resources, establishing alternative institutions, and developing organisational capacity to challenge the dominant power structure (Heras). In Australia, evidence suggests these efforts can be effective (Gulliver et al., "Understanding"; Gulliver et al., "Civil"). Advocacy groups across the country challenge the processes that enable fossil fuel companies and their enablers to perpetuate this artificial world by demanding greater action on climate change and transparency on climate-harming activities. Legal challenges focussing on climate accountability and greenwashing are proving to be effective avenues to shatter the industry's narrative veneer. Yet, despite increasing awareness of these strategies used to maintain this artificial world, emissions continue to rise. Dismantling this artificial world, therefore, requires more: a multifaceted approach that dismantles the industry's narrative control, economic influence, and societal embeddedness. By shifting focus from individual actions to the systemic forces that lock in fossil fuel use, we can more effectively confront the power structures that underpin the fossil fuel industry&#8217;s power. This involves not only challenging the industry directly but also addressing the broader societal and economic structures that enable its continued dominance.
