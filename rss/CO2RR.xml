                Abstract This study analyzes the principles and methods of carbon dioxide mineralization fixation to address the challenges posed by global climate and ecological changes, achieve carbon neutrality goals, and solve carbon utilization issues in the development of the fluorosilicon new material industry. The research focuses on the direct mineralization reaction system of carbon dioxide flue gas and the development of a carbon dioxide emission reduction device utilizing wet mineralized gas treatment technology. To implement alkaline waste management for industrial solid waste. The research shows that the wet carbon dioxide mineralization and emission reduction device can make the alkaline solution better mineralize carbon dioxide, avoid the gas discharge too fast and affect the reaction rate. At the same time, the solution is mixed and the exhaust linkage is carried out to further improve the reaction rate, and provide a reference for the development of large-scale carbon dioxide utilization technology suitable for high energy consumption industries.</description>

                The reduction of CO2 has become a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in efforts to search for long&#8208;term responses to climate change. We report a a couple of CO2&#8208;reducing molecular catalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant copper complexes. These are [Cu(DPA)(PyNAP)] (1) and [Cu(DPA)(PyQl)] (2) (where, DPA = pyridine&#8208;2,6&#8208;dicarboxylic acid, PyNAP = 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;1,8&#8208;naphthyridine, and PyQl = 2&#8208;(pyridin&#8208;2&#8208;yl)quinoline). The copper metal&#8208;catalysed 2&#8208;electron reduction of CO2 to CO in the presence of 2&#8208;protons is challenging. These catalysts exhibit the production of CO gas in DMF/water mixtures, achieving an impressive faradaic efficiency of 84% and 72% for complex 1 and 2 at &#8208;1.7 V vs. SCE, respectively, for selective CO2 reduction. The production of H2 due to 2H+ + 2e&#8208; was also observed as a byproduct through the competitive proton reduction reaction. This was cross&#8208;verified by online gas and mass analysis. Our investigations confirmed the stability of the electrocatalysts under the electrocatalytic conditions. The mechanistic pathways were proposed to work with the EECC and ECEC (E: electrochemical and C: chemical) mechanisms. A CO2 insertion into an in&#8208;situ generated hydride from the Cu&#8208;center generates CO through the favourable path.</description>

                Silylformates are emerging surrogates of hydrosilanes, able to reduce carbonyl groups in transfer hydrosilylation reactions, with the concomitant release of CO2. In this work, a new reactivity is revealed for silylformates, in the presence of imines. Using ruthenium catalysts, and lithium iodide as a co-catalyst, imines are shown to undergo hydrocarboxysilylation by formal insertion of CO2 to the N-Si bond of silyl amine to yield silyl carbamates in excellent yields.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Stability of Ultra-Thin Metal Oxide Catalyst Films in Non-thermal Plasma CO2 Reduction Reactions</title>

                The use of metal oxide catalysts to enhance plasma CO2 reduction has seen significant recent development towards processes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and produce renewable chemical feedstocks. While plasma reactors are effective at producing the intended chemical transformations, the conditions can result in catalyst degradation. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) can be used to synthesize complex, hierarchically structured metal oxide plasma catalysts that, while active for plasma CO2 reduction, are particularly vulnerable to degradation due to their high surface area and nanoscopic thickness. In this work, we characterized the effects of extended non-thermal, glow-discharge plasma exposure on ALD synthesized, ultra-thin film (&lt; 30 nm) TiO2 and ZnO catalysts. We used x-ray diffraction, reflectivity, and spectroscopy to compare films exposed to a CO2 plasma to ones exposed to an Ar plasma and to ones annealed in air. We found that the CO2 plasma exposure generated some surface reduction in TiO2 and increased surface roughening by a small amount, but did not initiate any phase changes or crystallite growth. The results suggest that ALD-deposited metal oxide films are robust to low pressure CO2 plasma exposure and are suitable as catalysts or catalyst supports in extended reactions.</description>

                Natural photosynthesis utilizes solar energy to convert water and atmospheric CO2 into carbohydrates through all-weather light/dark reactions based on molecule-based enzymes and coenzymes, inspiring extensive development of artificial photosynthesis. However, development of efficient artificial photosynthetic systems free of noble metals, as well as rational integration of functional units into a single system at the molecular level, remain challenging. Here we report an artificial system, the assembly system of Cu6 cluster and cobalt terpyridine complex, that mimics natural photosynthesis through precise integration of nanozyme complexes and ubiquinone (coenzyme Q) on Cu6 clusters. This biomimetic system efficiently reduces CO2 to CO in light reaction, achieving a production rate of 740.7 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with high durability for at least 188 hours. Notably, our system realizes the decoupling of light and dark reactions, utilizing the phenol-evolutive coenzyme Q acting as an electron reservoir. By regulating the stabilizer of coenzyme Q, the dark reaction time can be extended up to 8.5 hours, which fully meets the natural day/night cycle requirements. Our findings advance the molecular design of artificial systems that replicate the comprehensive functions of natural photosynthesis. Natural photosynthesis converts H2O and CO2 into carbohydrates through all-weather reactions based on enzymes and coenzymes. Here, the authors report an artificial photosynthesis system under intermittent light irradiation by integrating nanozyme complexes and ubiquinone on a copper nanocluster.</description>

                The synthesis of molecular host&#8208;guest complexes with enhanced performance, relative to those of their components, is a central theme in supramolecular chemistry. Here we explore a host&#8208;guest system consisting of an atomically precise gold nanocluster bound inside a zinc porphyrin nanoring. UV&#8208;vis absorption and fluorescence titrations with different sized nanorings revealed strong binding between a pyridinethiol&#8208;coated Au25 nanocluster and a nanoring consisting of six zinc porphyrin units, and complexation is confirmed by mass spectrometry. Formation of this assembly enhances the stability of the gold nanocluster. The host&#8208;guest complex also exhibits remarkable activity and selectivity for photochemical CO2 to CO conversion and singlet oxygen generation.</description>

                Immobilizing molecular catalysts on electro&#8208;conductive supports (for example, multi&#8208;walled carbon nanotubes, CNTs) represent a promising way to well&#8208;defined catalyst/support interfaces, which has shown appreciable performance for catalytic transformation. However, their full potential is far from achieved due to insufficient utilization of the intrinsic activity for each immobilized molecular catalyst, especially at loadings that should allow decent current densities. In the present work, we discover host&#8208;guest interaction between tetra&#8208;crown ether substituted cobalt phthalocyanine and metal ions, for example K+ ions, not only eliminate catalyst aggregation at immobilization procedures but also reinforce catalyst/support interactions by additional electrostatic attractions under operational conditions. Through simple dip&#8208;coating procedures, a successful single&#8208;molecular dispersion is achieved. Such a catalyst/electrode interface is stable and can selectively catalyze CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion (&#65310;96%) with almost unchanged turnover frequency (TOF) at all loading conditions, which implies a full utilization of the intrinsic activity of supported molecular catalysts. Therefore, a simultaneous achievement of high TOF and high current density (TOF of 111 s&#8208;1 at 38 mA/cm2) is achieved, in an aqueous H&#8208;type electrolyzer at an overpotential of 570 mV.</description>

      <title>A hybrid electro-thermochemical device for methane production from the air</title>

      <description>Yao&#8208;Wei Huang, Da Xu, Shuai Deng, Meng Lin, Nature Communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403467171

                Coupling direct air capture (DAC) with methane (CH4) production is a potential strategy for fuel production from the air. Here, we report a hybrid electro-thermochemical device for direct CH4 production from air. The proposed device features the cogeneration of carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) in a single compartment via a bipolar membrane electrodialysis module, avoiding a separate water electrolyzer, followed by a thermochemical methanation reaction to produce CH4. H2-induced disturbances lead to efficient CO2 extraction without pumping requirement. The energy consumption and techno-economic analysis predict an energy reduction of 37.8% for DAC and a cost reduction of 36.6% compared with the decoupled route, respectively. Accordingly, CH4 cost is reduced by 12.6%. Our proof-of-concept experiments show that the energy consumption for CO2 release and H2 production is 704.0 kJ mol&#8722;1 and 967.4 kJ mol&#8722;1, respectively with subsequent methanation achieving a 97.3% conversion of CO2 and a CH4 production energy of 5206.4 kJ mol&#8722;1 showing a promising pathway for fuel processing from the air. Direct capture and conversion of CO2 from the atmosphere is appealing to realize negative emissions but challenging due to the inherent low CO2 concentration. Here, authors report a proof-of-concept hybrid electro-thermochemical device for direct CH4 production from the air.</description>

      <title>The effects of climate change technology spillovers on carbon emissions across European countries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.122972</link>
      <description>Jaana Rahko, Andrew Adewale Alola, Journal of Environmental Management. 370(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403561586

                To unravel the challenges in the global diffusion of climate-friendly technologies, this investigation analyzes the diffusion of climate change-related technologies across countries. By using an unbalanced panel of selected European countries over the period 1990-2020, this investigation quantifies the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission effects of the diffusion of climate change-related technologies that are mediated by imports, geographical and technological proximity and free diffusion of technologies. In this study, the effects of domestic development of climate change-related technologies, population and affluence are also accounted for, and the emission effects are estimated using a fixed-effects panel model with instrumental variables. The instrumental variable for foreign technology spillovers is based on the technology support policies adopted in foreign countries. As expected, international spillovers of climate-friendly technologies are negatively linked to CO2 emissions, thus promoting emission reductions across the region. Importantly, emission reductions in Europe are more strongly influenced by international technology spillovers than by domestic innovation activities. Moreover, while all the analyzed technology diffusion channels appear relevant, the results are the most robust regarding import-mediated technology spillovers. Insights from this study support policy recommendations, especially in the trade policy context.</description>

      <title>Re-Imagining Trade Policy and Energy Efficiency: Groundbreaking Pathways to Strengthen Environmental Sustainability in South Korea</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app14209443</link>
      <description>Dongxue Wang, Yugang He, Applied Sciences. 14(20)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403491441

                This study explores the long-term interplay between trade policy, energy efficiency, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in South Korea, using data spanning from 1985 to 2023. By applying the Fourier autoregressive distributed lag (FARDL) model, the analysis reveals that while trade liberalization initially leads to a 0.23% increase in CO2 emissions for each 1% rise in trade openness&#8212;driven by the energy demands of industrial expansion&#8212;integrating energy efficiency standards within trade agreements helps mitigate these effects over time; this results in a 0.26% reduction in emissions for every 1% improvement in energy efficiency. The study also highlights the dual role of foreign direct investment (FDI), which contributes to a short-term 0.08% rise in emissions but significantly reduces carbon intensity in the long term by facilitating the adoption of cleaner technologies. These findings underscore the importance of innovation and FDI in decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation. The study advocates for the incorporation of energy efficiency measures into trade agreements and the prioritization of green technologies, recommending strategies that could enable South Korea to reduce its CO2 emissions by up to 40% by 2030. This research positions South Korea as a key actor in achieving global climate goals while maintaining economic competitiveness, offering valuable insights into the balance between sustainable development and industrial growth.</description>

      <title>Minimizing CO2 Emission of POME Treatment System Using MILP Model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202410.1065.v1</link>
      <description>Sivakumar Pallikodathan, Hasfalina Che Man, Tinia Idaty, A. B. R. Sulaiman, Gunasilan Nagarajoo, Mohamad Firdza Shukery, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403439460

                This paper presents a strategic planning model aimed at optimizing the economic and environmental impacts of Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) treatment systems. The model determines the optimal selection of POME treatment systems to minimize environmental impact, specifically focusing on three systems: Anaerobic Digester Tank System (ADT), Covered Lagoon System (CL) with biogas capture, and Open Pond System (OP). The model incorporates constraints related to Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB) production, POME generation, Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions. The optimization framework, formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, is solved using the GAMS 40.1.0 software. Integer decision variables are used to represent the choice of POME treatment systems that minimize environmental impact. The study specifically considers the ADT, CL, and OP systems, with results indicating that the ADT system is the most effective in reducing BOD, COD, and CO2 equivalent emissions, thereby highlighting its environmental benefits. The model has selected the ADT treatment system, which exhibits the lowest COD, BOD and CO2e emissions. Specifically, the COD registered an 85% reduction rate from 84,830 mg/L to 12,725 mg/L. The BOD level was reduced by 88% resulting in a BOD level from 41,208 mg/L to 4,945 mg/L. The minimum CO2e emission that can be archived was about 3,034 t CO2e per annum. This model provides a valuable tool for governmental agencies and policymakers to guide the private sector in developing environmentally sustainable POME treatment strategies.</description>

                The performance of mid-infrared (MIR) on-chip gas sensors, operating via laser absorption spectroscopy, hinges critically on light&#8211;matter interaction dynamics, significantly influenced by external confinement and the effective light path length. Conventional on-chip sensors, however, face challenges in achieving the required limit of detection for highly sensitive applications, primarily due to their intrinsically short effective light path. Furthermore, these sensors are limited in their spectral range coverage within the MIR spectrum by the constraints of standard silicon-based platforms. To overcome these limitations, our research presents a novel approach to fabricate a freestanding germanium (Ge) photonic crystal waveguide (PCW) on a germanium-on-insulator (Ge&#8211;OI) platform, utilizing yttrium oxide (Y2O3) as the buried oxide layer. This device leverages the broad transparent windows of Ge and Y2O3, broadening the spectral coverage across the MIR range. The introduction of the PCW and its slow light effect significantly elevate external confinement and light&#8211;matter interactions, enabling a notable reduction in waveguide length, which traditionally limits on-chip configurations. The freestanding structure not only expands the sensing region and enhances external confinement but also prevents the emergence of leaky modes within the PCW. As a result, our compact sensor achieves an exceptionally low LoD of 7.56 ppm for carbon dioxide (CO2) sensing at the operational wavelength of 4.23 &#956;m, with a compact waveguide length of only 800 &#956;m.</description>

      <title>Dry Reforming of Methane (DRM) over Hydrotalcite-Based Ni-Ga/(Mg, Al)Ox Catalysts: Tailoring Ga Content for Improved Stability</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14100721</link>

                Dry reforming of methane (DRM) is a promising way to convert methane and carbon dioxide into syngas, which can be further utilized to synthesize value-added chemicals. One of the main challenges for the DRM process is finding catalysts that are highly active and stable. This study explores the potential use of Ni-based catalysts modified by Ga. Different Ni-Ga/(Mg, Al)Ox catalysts, with various Ga/Ni molar ratios (0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and 1), were synthesized by the co-precipitation method. The catalysts were tested for the DRM reaction to evaluate their activity and stability. The Ni/(Mg, Al)Ox and its Ga-modified Ni-Ga/(Mg, Al)Ox were characterized by N2 adsorption&#8211;desorption, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), H2-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Raman techniques. The test of catalytic activity, at 700 &#176;C, 1 atm, GHSV of 42,000 mL/h/g, and a CH4: CO2 ratio of 1, revealed that Ga incorporation effectively enhanced the catalyst stability. Particularly, the Ni-Ga/(Mg, Al)Ox catalyst with Ga/Ni ratio of 0.3 exhibited the best catalytic performance, with CH4 and CO2 conversions of 66% and 74%, respectively, and an H2/CO ratio of 0.92. Furthermore, the CH4 and CO2 conversions increased from 34% and 46%, respectively, when testing at 600 &#176;C, to 94% and 96% when the catalytic activity was operated at 850 &#176;C. The best catalyst&#8217;s 20 h stream performance demonstrated its great stability. DFT analysis revealed an alteration in the electronic properties of nickel upon Ga incorporation, the d-band center of the Ga modified catalyst (Ga/Ni ratio of 0.3) shifted closer to the Fermi level, and a charge transfer from Ga to Ni atoms was observed. This research provides valuable insights into the development of Ga-modified catalysts and emphasizes their potential for efficient conversion of greenhouse gases into syngas.</description>

      <title>Carbon dioxide injection into the Achimov formations using reinjection technology by the example of Ach3-4 formation in the Novo-Urengoy area of the Urengoy field</title>

                The prerequisites for the study are the calculation results for the cycling process, where carbon dioxide is proposed as the injection agent into the Achimov formations instead of dry gas, with the goal of increasing the condensate recovery factor. The work is focused on the efficiency assessment of carbon dioxide reinjection technology and reducing carbon footprint at a late stage of field development. The research object is the &#1040;ch 3-4 formation within the Novo-Urengoy license area of the Urengoy field. The leading method to identify this problem is the results of the full-scale composite dynamic model in the ECLIPSE 300 format. The model takes into account the history of field development on depletion. The articles deals with two schemes for injecting carbon dioxide into the formation. In the first scheme, pure carbon dioxide is injected in a closed-loop system, but carbon neutrality through storage is not achieved. In the second scheme, carbon dioxide is injected using reinjection technology. Once injection begins, gas production stops. Only the condensate separated from the formation gas during low-temperature separation is sold and sent for further processing. After allocation of the condensate, the mixture of natural gas and carbon dioxide, in a specific proportion, is sent to the compressor station for reinjection into the formation in a gaseous state. Injecting pure carbon dioxide achieves a condensate recovery factor similar to that of gas injection with a 30 % carbon dioxide mixture. However, this option is less economically viable compared to the base and other scenarios due to high capital costs for upgrading the existing gas processing equipment (requiring the construction of an amine treatment unit). With carbon dioxide injection using reinjection technology, in addition to recovering extra condensate that had condensed during natural depletion, a reduction in the carbon footprint is also achieved. To maximize the condensate recovery factor, the optimal concentration of carbon dioxide in the injection mixture has been determined. The optimal timing for the start of injection was identified to maximize gas recovery. Economic efficiency is expected from the additional recovery of condensate trapped in the reservoir and from achieving carbon neutrality through the monetization and storage of carbon dioxide.</description>

      <title>Achieving Collaborative Pollutant and Carbon Emissions Reduction through Digital Governance: Evidence from Chinese Enterprises</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.120197</link>

                Under China's dual carbon goals, it is imperative for enterprises to effectively reduce carbon emissions while achieving pollutant reduction. This article explores the potential role of government-implemented digital governance in facilitating these objectives. Utilizing a quasi-natural experiment on digital governance, we established an analytical framework to thoroughly examine how digital governance can help Chinese enterprises realize synergistic effects in pollution control and carbon reduction. Our study reveals that digital governance significantly reduces enterprises' emissions of carbon dioxide and pollutants, with emission intensities of the carbon dioxide, air pollutant and water pollutant being decreased by approximately 6.9%, 7.3%, and 7.0%, respectively. These reductions are primarily driven by improvements in energy efficiency, the promotion of green innovation, digital transformation, and enhanced role of media. However, it is important to note that digital governance also negatively impacts overall corporate productivity and widens the digital divide between large and small-to-medium enterprises. The research results have practical significance for promoting the achievement of emission reduction goals and sustainable development for enterprises.</description>

                With China's proposed carbon reduction goals, many carbon monitoring pilot city projects have been launched, involving greenhouse gas (GHG) inverse estimate analysis based on GHG observations. For the evaluation of emissions estimates in a targeted urban area, the contributions of extra-urban fluxes on urban GHG observations must be excluded, especially for core cities within urban agglomerations, which face more severe emission interference from adjacent cities. In this study, we quantified the impact of external emissions on urban carbon dioxide (CO</description>

      <title>The effect of green credit policy on carbon emissions based on China&#8217;s provincial panel data</title>

                The attainment of "carbon peaking" and "carbon neutrality" is of utmost significance for the optimal progress of China's economy. As the main channel for green finance, the carbon reduction effectiveness of green credit policy is worth discussing. This article constructs an analytical framework for green credit, carbon emissions and technological advancement. Based on panel data from 30 provincial administrative regions in China from 2012 to 2021, this article uses the mediation effect model and the Spatial Durbin Model to investigate the transmission mechanism and spatial spillover effect of green credit policies on carbon emissions. According to baseline regression model results, our study revealed that overall, carbon emissions were reduced by green credit. The spatial spillover effect of green credit on carbon emissions points to the interconnectedness of different regions in terms of environmental impact. The significant negative indirect effect indicates that the increase of local green credit also has a significant inhibitory effect on surrounding carbon dioxide emissions. It suggests that efforts to reduce carbon emissions in one area can have positive consequences for neighboring regions as well. Green credit is able to reduce carbon emissions indirectly via technological advancement, according to the mechanism testing mediation effect model. This paper presents policy recommendations for relevant departments.</description>

                As the European Union (EU) is aiming to realize climate neutrality by 2050, there is a need to investigate greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction and carbon dioxide removal strategies (CRRS) from a life cycle perspective. Existing literature lacks harmonization of building-related strategies considering the whole-life cycle of buildings and the interlinkages across life cycle stages. The aim and novelty of this study was to systematically identify, classify and quantify the impacts of CRRS, as well as assess their applicability in different EU Member States. We identified a total of 35 measures grouped in 11 CRRS for the whole-life cycle of buildings. We classified these measures according to various criteria, such as the avoid-shift-improve framework or the life cycle stages influenced. We then assessed the potential diffusion of these strategies in each EU Member State up to 2050 via qualitative assessment criteria. We could achieve notable short-term reductions in GHG emissions by improving use-phase energy use, selecting low-carbon materials or reducing the per capital space demand. In the medium to long term, the applicability and reduction potential of strategies such as circularity and prioritizing renovation over new construction will increase as supply chains and skills develop across the EU. Due to their different potentials and times of implementation, the entire range of strategies is needed to support building and construction transition efforts.</description>

                Abstract Autotrophic antimony (Sb) oxidation coupled to nitrate reduction plays an important role in the transformation and detoxification of Sb. However, the specific oxidase involved in this process has yet to be identified. Herein, we enriched the microbiota capable of nitrate-dependent Sb(III) oxidation and identified a new Sb(III) oxidase in an uncultured member of Symbiobacteriaceae. Incubation experiments demonstrated that nitrate-dependent Sb(III) oxidation occurred in the microcosm supplemented with Sb(III) and nitrate. Both the 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic analyses indicated that a species within Symbiobacteriaceae played a crucial role in this process. Furthermore, carbon-13 isotope labelling with carbon dioxide-fixing Rhodopseudomonas palustris in combination with nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry revealed that a newly characterized oxidase from the dimethylsulfoxide reductase family, designated as NaoABC, was responsible for autotrophic Sb(III) oxidation coupled with nitrate reduction. The NaoABC complex functions in conjunction with the nitrate reductase NarGHI, forming a redox loop that transfers electrons from Sb(III) to nitrate, thereby generating the energy necessary for autotrophic growth. This research offers new insights into the understanding of how microbes link Sb and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles in the environment.</description>

      <title>Research progress of Mn-based low-temperature SCR denitrification catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1039/d4ra05140h</link>

                Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) is a efficiently nitrogen oxides removal technology from stationary source flue gases. Catalysts are key component in the technology, but currently face problems including poor low-temperature activity, narrow temperature windows, low selectivity, and susceptibility to water passivation and sulphur dioxide poisoning. To develop high-efficiency low-temperature denitrification activity catalyst, manganese-based catalysts have become a focal point of research globally for low-temperature SCR denitrification catalysts. This article investigates the denitrification efficiency of unsupported manganese-based catalysts, exploring the influence of oxidation valence, preparation method, crystallinity, crystal form, and morphology structure. It examines the catalytic performance of binary and multicomponent unsupported manganese-based catalysts, focusing on the use of transition metals and rare earth metals to modify manganese oxide. Furthermore, the synergistic effect of supported manganese-based catalysts is studied, considering metal oxides, molecular sieves, carbon materials, and other materials (composite carriers and inorganic non-metallic minerals) as supports. The reaction mechanism of low-temperature denitrification by manganese-based catalysts and the mechanism of sulphur dioxide/water poisoning are analysed in detail, and the development of practical and efficient manganese-based catalysts is considered.</description>

      <title>Sharing is caring for the environment: But why would managers resist shared mobility?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/bse.4006</link>

                Abstract The debate on carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction strategies for a sustainable environment continues unabated. Thus, this study proposes and validates a model for understanding essential factors that can explain resistance to managers' bus&#8208;sharing system (MBS). MBS is a sustainability strategy where organizations have well&#8208;maintained buses to transport 10&#8211;15 managers to and from work. By drawing on an extended status quo bias theory, the study sampled and analyzed 234 responses from managers using the partial least square structural equation modeling. The results show that perceived switching benefits (PSWB) and perceived switching costs (PSWC) relate to perceived value and influence resistance to the proposed MBS. Meanwhile, managers' family/personal life conflicts and perceived prestige concerns increase the PSWC. These findings have essential theoretical implications for sustainability scholarship and inform organizations to adopt family&#8208;friendly policies to reduce resistance to MBS.</description>

                Abstract The synthesis of battery materials from biomass as feedstock is not only effective but also aligns with sustainable practices. However, current methods like slow pyrolysis/heating are both energy&#8208;intensive and economically impractical. Hence, integrating energy&#8208;efficient technologies becomes imperative to curtail substantial energy consumption and, consequently, minimize carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions during electricity usage. Herein, we employed a one&#8208;step pyrolysis/reduction based on the microwave heating method to synthesize a composite of high&#8208;purity silicon and highly graphitized carbon (Si@GC) from rice husk as feedstock. Compared to the conventional heating methods, the Si@GC samples prepared via the microwave heating method required less time (30&#8211;50 min). Benefiting from ultrahigh heating rates, the highly graphitized carbon and crystalline silicon composite was successfully synthesized. The synthesis by microwave irradiation showed homogenous material, excellent surface area, essential functional groups, and crystallinity revealing the outstanding reaction kinetics to form the material. The as&#8208;synthesized Si@GC composite anode material delivered a high discharge capacity of 799 mAh/g with high cyclic stability of ~71% over 120 cycles. The ex situ ToF&#8208;SIMS revealed great inorganic SEI composition, mainly consisting of the fluorinated species and carbonate species produced at the initial cycle. This investigation provides a novel rapid heating method for the synthesis of battery materials, which can also be extended for other materials and applications.</description>

      <title>DiffGLE: Differentiable Coarse-Grained Dynamics using Generalized
  Langevin Equation</title>

                Capturing the correct dynamics at the Coarse-Grained (CG) scale remains a central challenge in the advancement of systematic CG models for soft matter simulations. The Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE), rooted in the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, provides a robust framework for incorporating friction and stochastic forces into CG models, that are lost due to the reduction in degrees of freedom. Leveraging recent advancements in Automatic Differentiation (AD) and reformulating the non-Markovian GLE using a colored noise ansatz, we present a top-down approach for accurately parameterizing the non-Markovian GLE for different coarse-grained fluids that accurately reproduces the velocity-autocorrelation function of the original All-Atom (AA) model. We demonstrate our approach on two different fluids namely, SPC/E water and carbon dioxide which have distinct structure and dynamical characteristics. Importantly, by being end-to-end differentiable, this approach offers a simplified and efficient solution to achieving accurate CG dynamics, effectively bypassing the complexities inherent in most bottom-up methods.</description>

                Enhancing the efficiencies of electrochemical reactions for converting renewable energy into clean chemical fuels as well as generating clean energy is critical to achieving carbon neutrality. However, this enhancement can be achieved using materials that are not constrained by resource limitations and those that can be converted into devices in a scalable manner, preferably for industrial applications. This review explores the applications of electrochemically deposited manganese dioxides (MnO2) and their composites as electrochemical catalysts for oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution reactions for converting renewable energy into chemical fuels. It also explores their applications as electrochemical catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and bifunctional OER/ORR for the efficient operation of fuel cells and metal&#8211;air batteries, respectively. Manganese is the second most abundant transition metal in the Earth&#8217;s crust, and electrodeposition represents a binder&#8208;free and scalable technique for fabricating devices (electrodes). To propose an improved catalyst design, the studies on the electrodeposition mechanism of MnO2 as well as the fabrication techniques for MnO2&#8208;based nanocomposites accumulated in the development of electrodes for supercapacitors are also included in this review.</description>

                This study investigates the impact of long-term water immersion on the mechanical and hydrochemical properties of cemented calcareous soil, emphasizing the critical role of carbonate content in mechanical performance. Utilizing hydrochemical analysis and triaxial testing, the research revealed that prolonged immersion disrupts the acid-base balance of the solution, resulting in an increased concentration of ions and chemicals. Significant dissolution of carbonates and soluble minerals occurs, which reacts with carbon dioxide to generate bicarbonate ions, thereby elevating the alkalinity of the soaking solution. Additionally, the gradual dissolution of clay minerals compromises the cementitious structure, leading to particle reorientation and interlocking. The study quantitatively assesses the changes in soil properties, demonstrating a substantial reduction in soil cohesion by up to 86.1% and an increase in the internal friction angle by 37.5%. Furthermore, the gradual dissolution of clay minerals compromises the cementitious structure, resulting in particle reorientation and interlocking that contribute to the observed mechanical changes. The findings underscore the importance of understanding the effects of extended immersion on the stability and engineering applicability of cemented calcareous soils.</description>

      <description>Shikuo Li, Yuyi Zhao, Qifeng Wang, Xuehan Li, Chao Chen, Yunxia Zuo, BMC Anesthesiology. 24(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403423909

                Prolonged electroencephalographic depression during surgery is associated with poor outcomes for patients. However, the published literature on electroencephalographic depression caused by a sudden increase in the partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) is lacking. We report four patients who were scheduled for laparoscopic liver surgery under general anesthesia. During the process of EEG monitoring with Sedline, four patients experienced electroencephalographic depression closely after a sudden increase in PETCO2. The four patients showed that electroencephalographic depression mainly manifested as a slow in EEG frequency, a reduction in the amplitude and power of EEG, and a decrease in spectral edge frequency. Patient state index was elevated in three cases. To summarize, our patients showed EEG depression when PETCO2 suddenly increased, which suggests that clinical doctors should be alert to electroencephalographic depression when the PETCO2 abruptly increases. EEG monitoring devices should be applied in patients with possible hypercapnia. Anesthesiologists must comprehensively interpret the raw EEG, spectral edge frequency, and density spectral array data, in addition to patient sedation index values.</description>

      <title>Energy use and greenhouse gas emissions in selected tea factories in Kenya</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pclm.0000329</link>
      <description>Joy Kibet, Sammy Letema, PLOS Climate. 3(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403448486

                Tea sector is a major contributor to Kenya&#8217;s economy through foreign exchange via export. However, extensive amount of energy is required to produce one kilogram of tea, making tea processing energy-intensive. Comparing greenhouse gas emissions from different types of energy consumed in tea factories is imperative to enable policymakers make informed intervention in emission reduction. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions in tea factories is one of the pathways to meeting Kenya&#8217;s nationally determined 32% reduction of carbon emissions by 2030 and commitment to the Paris Agreement. This paper assesses greenhouse gas emissions from different sources of energy used in four tea factories in Kenya. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission factor is used to calculate the total emissions of each type of energy used for 5 years. Life cycle assessment using SimaPro 8 software, Eco-indicator 99 method and Eco invent database was used to assess the specific compound causing the emission. The findings reveal that the 5-year greenhouse gas emissions by biogas, solar, wood, briquettes, and electricity are 336.111, 7.108, 3057.729, and 1,338.28 kg CO 2 /MWh, respectively. Firewood has the highest concentration of carbon dioxide, while solar energy has the least. Analysis of variance confirms significant difference (0.05&gt;p = 0.0272) in greenhouse gas emissions from the different energy sources. Post-hoc analyses shows a significant difference in emissions between solar and firewood (p&lt;0.0125) and no significant difference between other sources of energy. The key environmental hotspot is the energy intensive processes such as drying involved in tea production and processing, which leads to consumption of fossil fuel in the factories. To reduce such key hotspot, switching to renewable energy sources is key. Sustainability in the tea sector can therefore be achieved through switching to macadamia briquettes as a source of thermal energy and a combination of electricity and solar for electrical energy.</description>

      <title>Cascade Conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to Ethylene Carbonate under Ambient Conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c11390</link>
      <description>Zhaoyu Wen, Mengjing Wang, Chen&#8208;Jui Liang, Bolun Fan, Yuchen Yan, Fan Jia, Na Han, Yuhang Wang, Yanguang Li, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403553455

                Ethylene carbonate (EC) is the simplest cyclic carbonate with great industrial significance, most importantly as the vital electrolyte component for lithium-ion batteries. Its conventional synthesis generally involves the use of toxic precursors and requires elevated temperatures and pressures. Herein, we propose a cascade catalytic route for converting CO2 to EC under ambient conditions. Such a hybrid reaction scheme consists of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to ethylene catalyzed by copper in a membrane electrode assembly reactor, the bromine-mediated conversion of ethylene to bromoethanol catalyzed by WO3 nanoarrays grown on carbon cloth, and the reaction between bromoethanol and CO2 to form EC. By separately optimizing individual catalytic steps and then integrating them together in series, we achieved the conversion of CO2 to EC at a good yield under room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Our study also represents the first demonstration about the successful synthesis of organic carbonates from CO2 as the exclusive carbon source.</description>

      <title>Study on Thermal Chamber Expansion of VH-SAGD Process Using CO2-Inducing Effect for Heavy Oil Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12102260</link>
      <description>Haojun Xie, Shiming Zhang, Guanghuan Wu, Wei Li, Processes. 12(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403448923

                In heavy oil thermal recovery processes, higher pressure usually leads to low dryness and expansion difficulty for the injected steam in thermal recovery processes, which will result in lower oil recovery and more carbon emissions. This paper proposed a new CO2-inducing method to accelerate the steam chamber expansion, based on a core flooding experiment and numerical simulation. First, the CO2 showed significant viscosity reduction at high pressure in the PVT test. In the core flooding experiment, the CO2 provided strong flow conductivity in porous media for the thermal flooding, as the CO2 pre-injection restrained the steam condensation. Using the CO2-inducing method, CO2 pre-injection before steam built a fast flow channel in a relatively higher permeability layer and reduced the thermal injection pressure by about 1.0~2.4 MPa. As a result, the steam overlap around the injection wells became slower and the gravity drainage process was able to heat and displace the heavy oil above the channel. Furthermore, the CO2 gas trapped at the top reduced heat loss by about 12.4%. The field numerical simulation showed that this new method improved thermal recovery by 7.5% and reduced CO2 emissions by about 18 million kg/unit for the whole process. This method changes the conventional thermal expansion direction by CO2 inducing effect and fundamentally reduces heat loss, which provides significant advantages in low-carbon EOR.</description>

                The case study delves into the complex issue of CO2 footprint from three distinct viewpoints: sustainability, legislative, and managerial. Each perspective offers unique insights into the challenges and opportunities of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions using scope 1, 2, and 3 data. From a sustainability viewpoint, students are encouraged to explore the concept of CO2 footprint within the broader context of ESG considerations. Key questions delve into understanding sustainability frameworks, assessing the impact of CO2 emissions on ecosystems and communities, and exploring strategies for carbon footprint reduction aligned with sustainability goals. From the legislative perspective, students examine the regulatory landscape governing CO2 emissions. Students learn how legal frameworks shape corporate behavior by studying global sustainability goals such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and national legislation. Discussion questions focus on analyzing the effectiveness of existing regulations, identifying gaps, and proposing regulatory strategies to incentivize carbon reduction. The managerial perspective emphasizes decision-making and goal-setting within organizations. Students explore how managers can leverage data on CO2 footprint to set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals for departments or individuals. This involves understanding the role of carbon accounting, evaluating trade-offs in sustainability initiatives, and exploring best practices in integrating sustainability into organizational strategy. The case encourages critical thinking and data analysis, allowing educators to pose additional questions based on student interests and course objectives. The rich dataset allows for extensive exploration beyond the core questions, facilitating interdisciplinary learning across various courses. Ultimately, the case is a versatile teaching tool that can be applied to courses focusing on sustainability, environmental studies, business ethics, managerial decision-making, and public policy. It equips students with the knowledge and skills to navigate the multifaceted challenges of reducing their CO2 footprint while advancing sustainable practices within organizations and society.</description>

      <title>Cradle-To-Gate Analyses of Biochar Produced from Agricultural Crop Residues by Vacuum Pyrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/ce/zkae069</link>
      <description>Nakum Divyangkumar, N. L. Panwar, Chitranjan Agrawal, Trilok Gupta, G. L. Meena, Manjeet Singh, Clean Energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403517028

                Abstract Agricultural waste, if not managed efficiently, can pose significant environmental threats. Biochar production, a cost-effective solution, offers a potential to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions and thereby combat climate change. However, the environmental impact of this process is not uniform and varies depending on the agricultural residue used. These impacts, spanning the entire lifecycle from cultivation to disposal, underscore the necessity of a thorough assessment before biochar can be widely adopted for practical applications. This study employs a cradle-to-gate approach to evaluate the life cycle assessment of producing biochar from various agro-residues, such as rice husk, sugarcane bagasse, and corn cob. The life cycle assessment was conducted using SimaPro software, version 9.5.0.1, and the ReCiPe impact assessment method. The results indicate that corn cob cultivation has the highest impact across most categories, while rice husks exhibit higher water consumption (2.8&#215;103 m3). Using diesel, electricity, and fertilizers significantly contributes to global warming potential. Sugarcane bagasse shows the most negligible impact during biomass cultivation. However, pyrolysis processes exhibit high implications on various indicators. Applying biochar to soil for carbon sequestration and improvement can reduce global warming potential. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates a notable reduction in global warming potential and cumulative energy demand, approximately 10-24 % and 4-11 MWh, respectively. Paddy cultivation and rice husk biochar production have a lesser environmental impact. Changing energy sources during biomass growth and biochar production significantly influences environmental factors.</description>

      <title>Coaxially Bi/ZnO@ZnSe array photocathode enables highly efficient CO2 to C1 conversion via long&#8208;lived high&#8208;energy photoelectrons</title>

                The key aspect of the photoelectrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (PEC CO2 RR) lies in designing cathode materials that can generate high&#8208;energy photoelectrons, enabling the activation and conversion of CO2 into high&#8208;value products. In this study, a coaxially wrapped ZnO@ZnSe array heterostructure was synthesized using a simple anion exchange strategy and metallic Bi nanoparticles (NPs) were subsequently deposited on the surface to construct a Bi/ZnO@ZnSe photocathode with high CO2 conversion capability. This array photocathode possesses a large aspect ratio, which simultaneously satisfies a low charge carrier migration path and a large specific surface area that facilitates mass transfer. Additionally, the barrier formed at the n&#8208;n heterojunction interface hinders the transfer of high&#8208;energy photoelectrons from ZnSe to lower energy levels, resulting in their rapid capture by Bi while maintaining a relatively long lifetime. These captured electrons act as active sites, efficiently converting CO2 into CO with a Faradaic efficiency above 88.9% at &#8208;0.9 V vs. RHE and demonstrating superior stability. This work provides a novel approach for synthesizing high&#8208;energy photoelectrode materials with long lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Effect of welding gas mixtures on weld material and bead geometry</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/1315/1/012007</link>
      <description>Michael A. Unger, Jo&#227;o R. Neves, Martin Schnall, IOP Conference Series Materials Science and Engineering. 1315(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403545844

                Abstract Shielding gas is an essential parameter in welding processes, serves to shield the molten material from the atmosphere and external contaminations while providing a stable electric-arc pathway during the process, thus influencing the quality of the weld bead and several other aspects of the process. Therefore, any welding-based process, such as wire-arc additive manufacturing, could benefit from shielding gas mixture optimisation to selectively improve the processing and possibly the final mechanical properties of the welded material. In this study welding of EN AW 5183 aluminium (single weld bead and wire-arc additive manufacturing build-up) was conducted using several gas mixtures and their influence on final geometry defects, and microstructure measured. The gas mixtures used were a combination of varying amounts of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and oxygen. These were added to commercially available argon gas. It was observed that: CO 2 additions led to an unfavourable bonding defect and increased mean grain size; nitrogen additions caused a decrease in mean grain size, decreased pore count while maintaining a similar pore volume fraction to the reference argon mixture samples; oxygen additions showed slight reduction of mean grain size, decreased pore count and decreased pore volume fraction. These results further showcase that varying shielding gas mixtures influence the final material properties and should be considered as an additional improvement route for conventional welding and additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>On the dependence of the catalytic activity of nickel ferrite nanoparticles in the oxidative dehydrogenation of 2-propanol on the crystallite size</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-4jzln</link>
      <description>Michael Pittenauer, Raffael Rameshan, Florian Schrenk, Chunlei Wang, Moritz Eder, Gareth S. Parkinson, Christoph Rameshan, Karin F&#246;ttinger, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403466060

                Nickel ferrite spinel nanoparticles of different crystallite sizes were prepared in a glycine assisted sol-gel autocombustion reaction and characterised by powder x-ray diffraction, attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy, near ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, nitrogen physisorption, hydrogen and carbon monoxide temperature programmed reduction and oxygen and carbon dioxide temperature programmed desorption. A different distribution of Ni2+ cations in the tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated sites of the spinel lattice and an increased reducibility of the smaller crystallite size sample were identified as the main impacts of different crystallite size. Their catalytic activity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of 2-propanol was investigated by temperature programmed reaction studies using different ratios of 2-propanol:O2 as well as of possible parallel and consecutive reactions at atmospheric pressure and maximum 400 &#176;C. Operando-DRIFTS-MS studies at different 2-propanol:O2 ratios were carried out under continuous-flow conditions at atmospheric pressure as well. Thereby, the increased reducibility of the small crystallite size sample could be linked to an unselective activity for dehydrogenation yielding acetone and hydrogen, partial oxidation of 2-propanol and acetone, and total combustion leading to a complex network of reactions going on, being further pushed by an excess of oxygen. Ex-situ x-ray diffraction measurements were performed following the temperature programmed reaction experiments. The large crystallite size sample was found to be generally less active, but more selective towards non-oxidative dehydrogenation. Ex-situ x-ray diffraction measurements performed following the temperature programmed reaction experiments confirmed the increased reducibility of the smaller crystallite size sample. In the operando IR studies, 2-propoxide, adsorbed acetone, carbonates and acetates were identified as species occurring in the reaction.</description>

                Aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 batteries suffer from sluggish solid&#8208;solid co&#8208;oxidation kinetics of C and Li2CO3, requiring extremely high charging potentials and leading to serious side reactions and poor energy efficiency. Herein, we introduce a novel approach to address these challenges by modulating the reaction pathway with tailored Pt d&#8208;electrons and develop an aprotic Li&#8208;CO2 battery with CO and Li2CO3 as the main discharge products. Note that the gas&#8208;solid co&#8208;oxidation reaction between CO and Li2CO3 is both kinetically and thermodynamically more favorable. Consequently, the Li&#8208;CO2 batteries with CoPt alloy&#8208;supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanofiber (CoPt@NCNF) cathode exhibit a charging potential of 2.89 V at 50 &#181;A cm&#8208;2, which is the lowest charging potential to date. Moreover, the CoPt@NCNF cathode also shows exceptional cycling stability (218 cycles at 50 &#181;A cm&#8208;2) and high energy efficiency up to 74.6%. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the lowered d&#8208;band center of CoPt alloy effectively promotes CO desorption and inhibits further CO reduction to C. This work provides promising insights into developing efficient and CO&#8208;selective Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.</description>

                Converting greenhouse gases into valuable products has become a promising approach for achieving a carbon&#8208;neutral economy and sustainable development. However, the conversion efficiency depends on the energy yield of the substrate. In this study, we developed an electro&#8208;biocatalytic system by integrating electrochemical and microbial processes to upcycle CO2 into a valuable product (ectoine) using renewable energy. This system initiates the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to methane, an energy&#8208;dense molecule, which then serves as an electrofuel to energize the growth of an engineered methanotrophic cell factory for ectoine biosynthesis. The scalability of this system was demonstrated using an array of ten 25 cm2 electrochemical cells equipped with a high&#8208;performance carbon&#8208;supported isolated copper catalyst. The system consistently generated methane at the cathode under a total partial current of approximately &#8722;37 A (~175 mmolCH4 h&#8211;1) and O2 at the anode under a total partial current of approximately 62 A (~583 mmolO2 h&#8211;1). This output met the requirements of a 3&#8208;L bioreactor, even at maximum CH4 and O2 consumption, resulting in the high&#8208;yield conversion of CO2 to ectoine (1146.9 mg L&#8211;1). This work underscores the potential of electrifying the biosynthesis of valuable products from CO2, providing a sustainable avenue for biomanufacturing and energy storage.</description>

      <title>Climate Change Effects in Stock Markets</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54097/430kvj67</link>
      <description>Yang Ju, Highlights in Business Economics and Management. 41(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403572021

                Climate change significantly impacts global stock markets through both short-term extreme weather events and long-term climate shifts. This study examines the relationship between CO2 emissions and stock returns across 19 countries from 2001 to 2020 using regression analysis. The findings also reveal a positive correlation between CO2 emissions and stock returns, indicating that investors anticipate higher returns to offset climate-related risks. This suggests that higher CO2 emissions drive investor expectations for increased returns to compensate for potential economic losses. The study highlights the importance of balanced emission reduction strategies and promoting green finance to support sustainable economic growth. Additionally, it underscores the need to integrate climate risks into financial decision-making, offering valuable insights into the financial implications of climate change and guiding policymakers and investors in addressing these challenges. By providing empirical evidence on the link between CO2 emissions and stock returns, this research enriches existing knowledge and emphasizes the financial risks and opportunities presented by climate change. The study's results align with the carbon risk premium theory, which posits that investors demand higher returns from companies with higher carbon emissions. This study advocates for policies that balance economic growth with environmental sustainability, promoting green finance initiatives to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on financial markets.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Derived Synthesis of the CuPd Sub-1nm Alloy for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-acetate Electroreduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c07711</link>
      <description>Siyang Nie, Liang Wu, Qingda Liu, Xun Wang, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403560250

                Bimetallic alloys exhibit remarkable properties in catalysis and energy storage, while their precise synthesis at the subnanoscale remains a formidable challenge due to their immiscible nature in thermodynamics. In this study, we engineer an atomically dispersed CuPd alloy with an average size of 1.5 nm loaded on CuO and phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) coassembly subnanosheets (CuO-PMA SNSs). Driven by the high vibrational entropy, Cu atoms could escape from CuO supports and bond with adjacent Pd single atoms, leading to the in situ formation of CuPd alloys. Furthermore, this strategy can also be utilized for synthesizing the ZnPt alloy with an average size of 1 nm, thereby providing a general pathway for the design of immiscible subnanoalloys. The fully exposed Cu&#8211;Pd pairs in CuPd subnanoalloys significantly enhance the adsorption and coverage of surface *CO during the electrochemical reduction of CO2, thereby leading to enhanced stability of ethenone intermediates and facilitating the production of C2 compounds. The resulting CuPd subnanoalloy exhibits a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 46.5 &#177; 2.1% for CO2-to-acetate electroreduction and achieves a high acetate productivity of 99 &#177; 2.8 &#956;mol cm&#8211;2 at &#8722;0.7 V versus RHE.</description>

      <title>Thermochemical Heterolytic Hydrogenation Catalysis Proceeds Through Polarization-Driven Hydride Transfer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-3rp1x</link>
      <description>Hai&#8208;Xu Wang, Yogesh Surendranath, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403476363

                Heterolytic hydrogenations, which split H2 across a hydride acceptor and proton acceptor, are a key class of reactions that span the chemical value chain, including CO2 hydrogenation to formate and NADH regeneration from NAD+. The dominant mechanistic models for heterogeneous catalysis of these reactions invoke classical surface mechanisms that ignore the role of interfacial charge separation. Herein, we quantify the electrochemical potential of the catalyst during turnover and uncover evidence supporting an interfacial electrochemical hydride transfer mechanism for this overall thermochemical reaction class. We find that the proton acceptor induces spontaneous electrochemical polarization of the metal catalyst surface, thereby controlling the thermodynamic hydricity of the surface M&#8211;H intermediates and driving rate-determining electrochemical hydride transfer to the hydride acceptor substrate. Overall, this model invokes that heterolytic hydrogenations proceed via the coupling of two electrochemical half-reactions, the hydrogen reduction reaction (HRR) and hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), which convert H2 to hydride and proton, respectively. This mechanistic framework, which applies across diverse reaction media and for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formate and NAD+ to NADH, enables the determination of intrinsic reaction kinetics and exposes design principles for the future development of sustainable hydrogenation reactivity.</description>

      <title>Proposed standardization changes in the assessment of concrete durability</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5604/01.3001.0054.7473</link>

                The article presents the concept of concrete durability based on the system of concrete resistance classes to ERC exposure included in the proposed standardization documents (EN 206-1 together with EN 206-100 and Eurocode 2). According to the ERC concept, the performance properties of concrete are tested using recognized test methods, and the results are assessed on the basis of criteria independent of the composition of the tested concrete. The ERC durability concept is open to new technical and standardization solutions in the field of concrete composition (new additives) and cement and should replace the generally applicable prescriptive solutions. This solution is important from the point of view of reducing the emissions of the cement industry (production of multi-component cements and the use of new non-clinker main ingredients) and reducing the carbon footprint of concrete (CO2 reduction classes of concrete according to prEN 206-1)</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sewage Sludge Stabilization, Pathogen Removal, and Biomass Production through Indigenous Microalgae Promoting Growth: A Sustainable Approach for Sewage Sludge Treatment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/recycling9050097</link>
      <description>Hajer Ben Hamed, Antoine Debuigne, Hetty KleinJan, Dominique Toye, Ang&#233;lique L&#233;onard, Recycling. 9(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403490659

                Sewage sludge (SS), a byproduct of wastewater treatment plants, poses significant environmental and health risks if not properly handled. Conventional approaches for SS stabilization often involve costly and energy-consuming processes. This study investigated the effect of promoting native microalgae growth in SS on its stabilization, pathogen bacteria removal, and valuable biomass production. The effect on settleability, filterability, and extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) was examined as well. Experiments were conducted in photobioreactors (PBRs) without O2 supply and CO2 release under controlled parameters. The results show a significant improvement in SS stabilization, with a reduction of volatile solids (VSs) by 47.55%. Additionally, fecal coliforms and E. coli were efficiently removed by 2.25 log and 6.72 log, respectively. Moreover, Salmonella spp. was not detected after 15 days of treatment. The settleability was improved by 71.42%. However, a worsening of the sludge filterability properties was observed, likely due to a decrease in floc size following the reduction of protein content in the tightly bound EPS fraction. Microalgae biomass production was 16.56 mg/L/day, with a mean biomass of 0.35 g/L at the end of the batch treatment, representing 10.35% of the total final biomass. These findings suggest that promoting native microalgal growth in SS could be sustainable and cost-effective for SS stabilization, microalgal biomass production, and the enhancement of sludge-settling characteristics, notwithstanding potential filtration-related considerations.</description>

                Abstract Urban traffic congestion and pollution represent critical challenges for sustainable city development. In this paper, we presents a novel approach to optimizing urban mobility infrastructure using a stochastic relaxation algorithm. The method is designed to address the growing challenges of traffic congestion, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions in rapidly urbanizing cities. The system automates the generation and evaluation of road network modifications, drastically reducing the time and effort required for traditional simulation-based approaches. By utilizing real-time traffic data and traffic flow reconstruction algorithms within the Snap4City platform, the proposed system allows for the efficient exploration of "what-if" scenarios, optimizing key performance indicators such as travel time, fuel use, and emissions. A case study conducted in Florence, Italy, demonstrates significant improvements in traffic conditions, fuel efficiency, and emissions reduction, underscoring the system's potential to enhance urban mobility in a sustainable manner. This system has been developed exploiting the Snap4City platform Scenario Editor and platform.</description>

                Antioxidant capacity is one of the most important biological activities in fruits and vegetables and is closely related to human health. In this study, &#8216;Eureka&#8217; lemons were used as experimental materials and stored at 7&#8211;8 &#176;C MT (melatonin, 200 &#956;mol, soaked for 15 min) and CA (controlled atmosphere, 2&#8211;3% O2 + 15&#8211;16% CO2) individually or in combination for 30 d. The changes in lemon fruits&#8217; basic physicochemical properties, enzyme activities, and antioxidant capacities were studied. Comparing the combined treatment to the control, the outcomes demonstrated a significant reduction in weight loss, firmness, stomatal opening, and inhibition of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) activities. Additionally, the combined treatment maintained high levels of titratable acidity (TA), vitamin C (VC), total phenolic content (TPC), and antioxidant capacity and preserved the lemon aroma. Meanwhile, the correlation between fruit color, aroma compounds, and antioxidant capacity was revealed, providing valuable insights into the postharvest preservation of lemons. In conclusion, the combined treatment (MT + CA) was effective in maintaining the quality and antioxidant capacity of lemons.</description>

      <description>Ana Cano-Ort&#237;z, Jos&#233; Carlos Pi&#241;ar Fuentes, J. Pe&#241;a&#8208;Mart&#237;nez, Eus&#233;bio Cano, Soil Systems. 8(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403516759

                The world is currently experiencing unsustainable development, which poses significant risks to global society. In response, there is a growing advocacy for sustainable development across all sectors, driven by social resilience. This shift is fostering substantial socio-environmental tensions. However, the combined power of scientific research and social education has the potential to reverse this trend. Transitioning from an unsustainable territorial model to a sustainable one is both feasible and economically profitable. This transition can be achieved through knowledge of soil bioindicators, which provide valuable information about soil nutrient content. By understanding these indicators, nutrient inputs can be tailored, reducing or eliminating pollutants such as excessive fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides. Training experts and raising social awareness through education on new research are essential steps in this process. For decades, it has been recognized that globalization, industrialization, and population growth have driven unsustainable development, leading to degraded agroecosystems. To address this issue, government institutions are promoting sustainability through ecological agriculture and CO2 reduction, both of which can be supported by the use of soil bioindicators.</description>

      <title>Environmental and Socio-Economic Impact Assessment of Renewable Energy Using Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.32996/jefas.2024.6.5.13</link>
      <description>Md Fakhrul Islam Sumon, Md Osiujjaman, MD Azam Khan, Arifur Rahman, Md. Shazib Uddin, Laxmi Prasad Pant, Pravakar Debnath, Journal of Economics Finance and Accounting Studies. 6(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403567651

                Renewable energy sources, such as solar, hydro, wind, and geothermal energy, have emerged as key alternatives to fossil fuels in combating climate change and addressing energy security concerns in the USA and ad worldwide. Strategic use of this renewable resource is important not only for carbon emission reduction and improvement of environmental sustainability but also for maintaining future energy supplies. At the same time, such transition raises thorough assessments of environmental and socio-economic impacts. Machine learning (ML) models offer a powerful tool for predicting and analyzing such impacts, allowing for more efficient decision-making and long-term planning. These models are supposed to analyze patterns in energy production, land use, and emissions to make a more dynamic and predictive understanding of how renewable energy adoption influences CO2 levels. The principal aim of this research project was to develop and curate machine learning algorithms for predicting CO2 emissions based on renewable energy data, using the knowledge to better understand how solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy systems affect environmental outcomes. The predictive models developed in this research would serve as useful tools for the policymakers and major stakeholders in decision-making on investments in energy infrastructure and characterization of regulatory frameworks. These datasets for this research project were retrieved from several prominent institutions, including governmental agencies, international organizations such as the International Energy Agency-IEA and the World Bank, satellite data repositories, and USA environmental monitoring agencies. For this research project, 3 machine learning algorithms in the experiment were used, namely Logistic Regression, XG-Boost, and Random Forest. Amongst these three, the linear regression model gave the best performance, as it had the least MSE; indicating that its predictive capability was impressive. The comparative analysis of renewable energy projects in Germany, China, and California underlines that effective policy-making plays a very decisive role in the transition toward sustainable energy.</description>

      <title>Exploring Hybrid Vehicle Integration in Nablus Urban Shared-Taxis: Cost-Benefit and Exhaust Emissions Assessment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.35552/anujr.a.39.1.2317</link>
      <description>Sharif Bassam Salman, Khaled Al&#8208;Sahili, An-Najah University Journal for Research - A (Natural Sciences). 39(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403414127

                There is a worldwide concern about the increase in vehicles&#8217; exhaust emissions of traditional fuels and the rise in fuel prices. Nablus city is a major city in the West Bank, Palestine with peculiar topography and traffic congestion. This increases fuel consumption and the gas emission of the diesel operated public transport (PT) shared-taxi vehicles. This paper investigates the viability of introducing hybrid vehicles to the urban shared-taxis in highly congested areas with peculiar topography. Interviews were conducted and questionnaires were distributed among PT drivers and route managers to obtain the operational and cost characteristics of each route. The existing expenses and revenues and gas emissions of diesel vehicles were analyzed. Expenses-revenues analysis revealed that there is no immediate urgency in switching all diesel-fuel shared-taxis to hybrid; therefore, two scenarios were developed. The first was replacing old PT cars (2009 or older) with hybrid vehicles, which provided an average financial saving of 20.9% with a reduction in exhausts emission of CO2-equivalent by 33%. The second scenario included replacing PT vehicles with production dates from 2009-2014, which produced financial savings of 15% and reduction of exhaust emissions by 35%. The comparison showed a preference for the first scenario at the current time, while implementing other scenarios gradually. The first scenario is simple and close to reality; as old vehicles should typically be replaced. The study recommends using hybrid vehicles for new shared-taxis introduced to the service, and establishing national level policies to encourage the use of alternative fuels for the transportation sector, focusing on PT. However, several critical factors must be considered, including topography and route characteristics.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Fuels for Decarbonising UK Rural Transport</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/encyclopedia4040101</link>
      <description>Al-Amin Abba Dabo, Andrew Gough, F. Frank Alparslan, Encyclopedia. 4(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403513454

                Decarbonising transport is a crucial element of the UK&#8217;s strategy to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, as the transport sector is currently the largest contributor to the UK&#8217;s greenhouse gas emissions. Rural communities face distinct challenges in this effort due to their reliance on internal combustion engines (ICEs) across vehicles and machinery essential for daily life, including farming equipment and private transport. While the upcoming ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles paves the way for the adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs), this solution may not fully address the unique needs of rural areas where infrastructure limitations and specific mobility requirements pose significant barriers. In this context, synthetic fuels, produced using renewable energy sources, offer a potential alternative. These fuels can be used directly in existing internal combustion engines without requiring major modifications and have the added benefit of reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions by capturing CO2 during production. This entry explores the potential advantages of adopting synthetic fuels, particularly in rural areas, and examines how community-based buying cooperatives could support their wider use through bulk purchasing, cost reduction, and community empowerment.</description>

      <title>Warm Arctic-Cold Eurasia pattern helps predict spring wildfire burned area in West Siberia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-53470-4</link>
      <description>Zhicong Yin, Yijia Zhang, Shengping He, Huijun Wang, Nature Communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403556988

                Extreme wildfires have devastating impacts on multiple fronts, and associated carbon greatly heats the earth's climate. Whether and how to predict wildfires becomes a critical question. In this study, we find that the preceding-winter "warm Arctic-cold Eurasia" (WACE) pattern significantly enlarges the spring burned area in West Siberia. The winter WACE and accompanying snow reduction result in dryness and vegetation exposure in West Siberia in spring, increasing fire risks. A multiple linear regression model is constructed that successfully predicts the spring burned area in West Siberia one season in advance (R-squared coefficient=0.64). The same predictors also well predict the corresponding fire carbon emissions. Independent predictions for spring burned area in 2019 and 2020 are very close to observations, with a mean absolute percentage error of only 3.0%. The findings of this study provide a possibility for guarding humans against extreme wildfires and predicting sharp rises in carbon emissions. The authors show that the winter "warm Arctic-cold Eurasia" pattern significantly enhances spring fire activity in West Siberia, contributing to the prediction of wildfire burned area, and resulting CO2 emissions, one season in advance.</description>

      <title>Global Freight Transport Emissions Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.4c05658</link>
      <description>Jacob Fry, Keiichiro Kanemoto, Alastair Fraser, Keisuke Nansai, Environmental Science &amp; Technology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403549224

                The transportation of freight by land, sea and air underpins the complex network of global trade in physical commodities. Greenhouse gas emissions from freight transportation are a significant component of global emissions and are predicted to grow in coming decades. However, the inclusion of freight transport in emissions accounts and environmental impact studies is often incomplete. Both data availability and difficulties in allocating freight emissions to specific commodity trades contributes to this. In this study, international freight movements by transport mode are estimated from the bottom-up by imputing global freight transport routes. Emissions are estimated from these freight movements and integrated with a global multiregional input&#8211;output model. This enables the calculation of carbon footprints that are complete with respect to freight emissions. We estimate that global freight transport emissions contributed 2.8 Gt CO2-equiv in 2012, or about 41% of total transport emissions. In general, freight footprints contribute about 9% to national emissions footprints. While trade in physical commodities (such as construction materials, food and fossil fuels) are associated with the largest embodied freight emissions, services (such as public administration, education and health) also require significant freight transport. Using a consumption-based allocation of freight transport emissions allows the decarbonisation of other sectors to be complementary to the decarbonisation of transport through reduction in demand, for example through material efficiency strategies. To drive decarbonisation in maritime transport it is critical to include bunker emissions in national emissions inventories, thereby completing the system boundary.</description>
