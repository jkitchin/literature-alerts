      <title>A Review of the Effect of Defect Modulation on the Photocatalytic Reduction Performance of Carbon Dioxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29102308</link>

                Constructive defect engineering has emerged as a prominent method for enhancing the performance of photocatalysts. The mechanisms of the influence of defect types, concentrations, and distributions on the efficiency, selectivity, and stability of CO2 reduction were revealed for this paper by analyzing the effects of different types of defects (e.g., metallic defects, non-metallic defects, and composite defects) on the performance of photocatalysts. There are three fundamental steps in defect engineering techniques to promote photocatalysis, namely, light absorption, charge transfer and separation, and surface-catalyzed reactions. Defect engineering has demonstrated significant potential in recent studies, particularly in enhancing the light-harvesting, charge separation, and adsorption properties of semiconductor photocatalysts for reducing processes like carbon dioxide reduction. Furthermore, this paper discusses the optimization method used in defect modulation strategy to offer theoretical guidance and an experimental foundation for designing and preparing efficient and stable photocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic and Electronic Insights into Efficient Carbon Dioxide Reduction Driven by Visible Light Using a Coordination Polymer</title>

                In this study, a comprehensive theoretical analysis was undertaken to elucidate the remarkably efficient conversion of CO2 into HCOO&#8211; employing a coordination polymer featuring Pb&#8211;S bonds, namely [Pb(tadt)]n (where tadt stands for 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2,5-dithiolate), referred to as KGF-9. The catalytic activity of this visible-light responsive solid photocatalyst has been carefully compared with that of PbS, a typical compound that also contains the Pb&#8211;S bond. The former shows a very high catalytic activity, while the latter shows almost no activity. The photoreduction process of CO2 on the KGF-9 surface was analyzed in detail using periodic density functional theory calculations. The reduced catalyst surface was modeled as a hydrogenated surface. The reaction at the active center of a formate dehydrogenase provides an interesting contrast, suggesting that the S&#8211;H group plays an important role in the conversion of CO2 to HCOO&#8211;. However, the S&#8211;H group on the reduced PbS surface does not facilitate the conversion to the same extent as KGF-9. This is because the electrons supplied to CO2 on the PbS surface come from deep within the solid, whereas on KGF-9, they come from the top surface. This difference is due to differences in the electronic structure of the S&#8211;H bond, band gap, and valence band maximum position between the two surfaces, accounting for the marked difference in their catalytic activity. These insights are consistent with experimental and computational results on the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of the CO2 reduction reaction of KGF-9 and PbS, and provide guidance for the design of CO2 photoreduction catalysts.</description>

      <title>Rate-Determining Step for Electrochemical Reduction of Carbon Dioxide into Carbon Monoxide at Silver Electrodes</title>

                Silver is one of the most studied electrode materials for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide, a product with many industrial applications. There is a growing number of reports in which silver is implemented in gas diffusion electrodes as part of a large-scale device to develop commercially relevant technology. Electrochemical models are expected to guide the design and operation toward cost-efficient devices. Despite decades of investigations, there are still uncertainties in the way this reaction should be modeled due to the absence of scientific consensus regarding the reaction mechanism and the nature of the rate-determining step. We review previously reported studies to draw converging conclusions on the value of the Tafel slope and existing species at the electrode surface. We also list conflicting experimental observations and provide leads to tackling these remaining questions.</description>

      <title>Supported tetra-atom clusters on g-CN as catalysts for electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to formate: A computational study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apsusc.2024.160299</link>

                Single-cluster catalysts (SCCs) have emerged as highly efficient catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), providing a promising avenue to solve the carbon dilemma. Based on density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigated the capability of 12 tetra-atom transitional-metal clusters anchored on g-CN (TM4@g-CN) for CO2RR and found that all clusters have good stability on the substrate. Notably, the charge variation of the top metal atom (TM4) of six SCCs is close to zero which makes them readily donate electrons to the adsorbate CO2 and subsequent reaction intermediates. Our results demonstrate that CO2 can be efficiently reduced to HCOOH on Ni4, Cu4, and Au4@g-CN with low limiting potentials of &#8722;0.21, &#8722;0.22, and &#8722;0.19 V, respectively, outperforming the corresponding single-atom counterparts. Both &#916;G(&#8727;CO2) and &#916;G(&#8727;OCHO/&#8727;COOH) exhibit a volcano relationship with the reaction activity, and the TM4 serves as electron reservoirs throughout the entire reaction process. This work offers valuable insights for the advancement of cost-effective supported single cluster catalysts.</description>

      <title>Density Functional Study of Electrocatalytic Carbon Dioxide Reduction in Fourth-Period Transition Metal&#8211;Tetrahydroxyquinone Organic Framework</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29102320</link>
      <description>Yufeng Wen, Xianshi Zeng, Yanan Xiao, Rong Wen, Kai Xiong, Zhangli Lai, Molecules/Molecules online/Molecules annual. 29(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396928519

                This study investigates the utilisation of organometallic network frameworks composed of fourth-period transition metals and tetrahydroxyquinone (THQ) in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed in analysing binding energies, as well as the stabilities of metal atoms within the THQ frameworks, for transition metal TM-THQs ranging from Y to Cd. The findings demonstrate how metal atoms could be effectively dispersed and held within the THQ frameworks due to sufficiently high binding energies. Most TM-THQ frameworks exhibited favourable selectivity towards CO2 reduction, except for Tc and Ru, which experienced competition from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and required solution environments with pH values greater than 5.716 and 8.819, respectively, to exhibit CO2RR selectivity. Notably, the primary product of Y, Ag, and Cd was HCOOH; Mo produced HCHO; Pd yielded CO; and Zr, Nb, Tc, Ru, and Rh predominantly generated CH4. Among the studied frameworks, Zr-THQ displayed values of 1.212 V and 1.043 V, corresponding to the highest limiting potential and overpotential, respectively, while other metal&#8211;organic frameworks displayed relatively low ranges of overpotentials from 0.179 V to 0.949 V. Consequently, it is predicted that the TM-THQ framework constructed using a fourth-period transition metal and tetrahydroxyquinone exhibits robust electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 catalytic activity.</description>

      <title>Experimental screening of intermetallic alloys for electrochemical CO2 reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cattod.2024.114805</link>

                In this study, we experimentally screen a promising class of intermetallic alloys for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 toward hydrocarbon products. Based on previous DFT-based screening papers, combinations of strongly CO-binding metals such as iron, cobalt, and nickel with weakly CO-binding metals such as gallium, aluminium or zinc were selected as potentially promising catalytic materials. Despite the challenging production of these alloys, we report a general two-step synthesis method for intermetallic alloys and discuss the specific synthesis conditions that must be taken into account when synthesising these materials. After their synthesis, we use a recently developed differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) setup to rapidly quantify the CO2 reduction products over a range of potentials. Almost all newly developed intermetallic catalysts are shown to produce methane and ethylene, while the CoSn catalyst showed higher selectivity towards formate production. However, all tested catalysts mostly produced hydrogen and only reduce CO2 to a small extent, despite the favourable computational screening results. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy and outline a more holistic approach for linking future DFT studies with experiments.</description>

      <title>Anion effect in electrochemical CO2 reduction: from spectators to orchestrators</title>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) offers a pathway to produce valuable chemical fuels from CO2. However, its efficiency in aqueous electrolytes is hindered by the concurrent H2 evolution reaction (HER), which takes place at similar potentials. While the influence of cations on this process has been extensively studied, the influence of anions remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study how eCO2RR selectivity and activity on a gold catalyst are affected by a wide range of inorganic and carboxylate anions. We utilize in situ differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) for real-time product monitoring, coupled with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We show, that anions significantly impact eCO2RR kinetics and eCO2RR selectivity. MD simulations reveal a new descriptor &#8211; free energy of anion physisorption &#8211; where weakly adsorbing anions enable favorable CO2 reduction kinetics. By leveraging these fundamental insights, we identify propionate as the most promising anion, achieving nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency while showing high CO production rates that are comparable to those in bicarbonate. These insights underscore the vital role of anion selection in achieving highly efficient eCO2RR in aqueous electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of Ni-NHC CO2 Reduction Catalysis Predominantly Affording Formate via Attack of Metal Hydride to CO2</title>

      <description>Chen Liao, Kosei Yamauchi, Ken Sakai, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396898773

                The catalytic role of hydride intermediate in the CO2 reduction to formate (HCOO&#8722;) by NiII-NHC complexes is investigated in detail by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is found that a NiII-hydride is sufficiently hydridic to facilitate the efficient transfer of hydride to the carbon center of CO2, leading to the HCOO&#8722; production. Importantly, the direct hydride transfer path proposed here bypasses the conventional CO2 insertion into a metal-hydride bond. This mechanism is elucidated through a detailed analysis of the free energy changes of the reaction and the activation barriers, where key parameters such as reduction potentials, pKa values, and the thermodynamics of hydride transfer are thoroughly evaluated. The thermodynamic hydricity of the NiII-hydride, calculated to be &#916;GH&#8722; = 19.2 kcal/mol, is in sharp contrast with the less effective NiIII-hydride with &#916;GH&#8722; = 52.4 kcal/mol, highlighting the enhanced reactivity of NiII-hydride in HCOO&#8722; formation. Additionally, an examination of the competitive formation of CO and H2 reveals the preferential tendency of NiII-hydride to produce HCOO&#8722; over these byproducts. Insights into the influence of the pKa for the proton source on the feasibility of H2 production and HCOO&#8722; selectivity are also provided, suggesting a way to optimize reaction conditions for improved selectivity and efficiency. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the CO2 reduction to HCOO&#8722; by NiII-NHC catalysts, emphasizing the direct hydride transfer mechanism rather than the classical CO2 insertion mechanism.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insight into Electrocatalytic Co2 Reduction to Formate by the Iron(I) Porphyrin Complex</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4830504</link>
      <description>Yaqing Wang, Wenzhen Lai, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396981813

                Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 into value-added chemicals has been considered as a promising pathway to alleviate the energy crisis and global warming. Iron porphyrins have been extensively studied for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and are well documented to promote CO2-to-CO conversion. However, the mechanism of CO2-to-HCOO- conversion by Fe porphyrin remains unclear. Here, by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigated the detailed mechanism of a novel Fe porphyrin catalyst for CO2 reduction to HCOO- in its Fe(I) state. Our results demonstrated that the reduction of CO2 to HCOO- proceeds through the C-protonation of an FeII-OCO&#183;- complex rather than through the hydrolysis of an FeIII-COOH complex or CO2 insertion in an Fe-H bond. Moreover, the FeIII-COOH complex is not a stable intermediate. The protonation of its hydroxyl group with concomitant C-OH bond cleavage to produce CO is thermodynamically and kinetically unfeasible. Instead, the FeIII-COOH complex can undergo a coordination switch followed by a conformational change to form the active FeII-OCO&#183;- complex for production of HCOO-. Moreover, the single-electron reduction of FeIII-COOH gives FeII-COOH, which leads to formation of CO rather than HCOO-. The insights gained from this work may be useful for designing the electrocatalysts for selective CO2 reduction to formate.</description>

      <title>Building of rich (111) grain boundary in copper for syngas in electrochemical CO2 reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.124212</link>
      <description>Xiao Bai, Jingmin Ge, Heying Yang, Hua Tian, Xueqi Liu, Shiying Li, Zhikun Peng, Yaxi Li, Jiahao Wang, Hongpo Liu, Qun Xu, Applied catalysis. B, Environmental. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4397048659

                Building of grain boundary (GB) in Cu-based catalysts has been demonstrated to be an efficient strategy to control the product selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR). However, the fabrication and modulation of GBs in Cu are still challenging. In this study, a series of bare Cu catalysts with controllable density of Cu(111) GBs were investigated systematically for eCO2RR. These catalysts exhibit superior eCO2RR performance for syngas production with a high FE of ~80% and tunable H2/CO ratio of 0.46&#8722;2.78. Three-dimensional wormlike Cu with abundant (111) GBs displays a stable H2/CO ratio of ~0.5 over a wide potential range from &#8722;0.9 to &#8722;1.2 V (vs. RHE). In situ Raman and ATR-SEIRAS spectroscopy combined with DFT calculations reveal that Cu(111) GBs enhance the adsorption of CO2, lower the energy barriers of CO2 to &#8270;COOH and &#8270;CO, further highlighting the potential to control syngas production with desirable proportion over Cu-based catalysts.</description>

      <title>Pre-Reduction of Nchwaning Manganese Ore in Co/Co2, H2/H2o, and H2 Atmospheres</title>

                Hydrogen (H2), a relatively underexplored reductant in ferromanganese (FeMn) production, offers an attractive avenue for mitigating gaseous carbon (C) emissions. The reduction behaviour of South African Nchwaning manganese (Mn) ore using gaseous CO/CO2, H2/H2O, and H2 atmospheres was investigated experimentally in the temperature variation of 700, 800, and 900 &#176;C. The effect of different gas compositions and temperatures was studied using a vertical thermogravimetric (TG) tube furnace. During pre-reduction, two parallel reactions occurred, namely the reduction of higher Mn- and iron (Fe) -oxides, and the decomposition of carbonates. After each test, decrepitation, chemical composition, phase transformation, and porosity were characterised. Using the rate of mass loss, a kinetic model was obtained to predict kinetic constants. The oxidation state of the higher Mn- and Fe-oxides was lowered during CO/CO2 and H2/H2O pre-reduction. Only during pure H2 pre-reduction was Fe2+ reduced to its metallic state, Fe0. The majority of carbonates decomposed in the presence of the CO/CO2 atmosphere at 900 &#176;C, whereas in the presence of H2 in the reducing atmosphere carbonates decomposed at a higher rate and at lower temperatures. Additionally, the extent and rate of mass loss were expedited by increasing the temperature, employing H2-containing atmospheres, and lowering the oxygen partial pressure (pO2) of the H2-containing atmospheres. No significant trends were observed in ore decrepitation and porosity across various atmospheres and temperatures, except for decrepitation in the water vapour-containing atmosphere. The utilisation of a pure H2 atmosphere has a significant ability for pre-reducing manganese ores with carbonate content by expediting carbonate decomposition and promoting Fe-oxide metallisation, thereby enhancing the efficiency of ore treatment in metallurgical applications.</description>

                Photobiocatalytic CO2 reduction represents an attractive approach for conversion of solar light and abundant resources to value-added chemicals. However, the design of suitable systems requires a detailed understanding of the interaction between artificial photosensitizer and biocatalyst interface. In this work, we investigate the effect of surfactant charge utilized in the preparation of a phenoxazine-based organic molecule nanorods photosensitizer on the interaction with the carbon monoxide dehydrogenase II from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans within biohybrid assemblies for photobiocatalytic CO2 reduction into CO. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay in pair with cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) and detailed physicochemical characterization are conducted to understand the interaction at the biohybrid interface in order to suggest the strategy for future functionalization of nanoparticles that fulfill the needs from biocatalyst for green fuel production.</description>

                The bifunctional CO&#8208;dehydrogenase/acetyl&#8208;CoA synthase (CODH/ACS) complex couples the reduction of CO2 to the condensation of CO with a methyl&#8208;moiety and CoA to acetyl&#8208;CoA. Catalysis occurs at two sites connected by a tunnel transporting the CO. Here, we investigated how the bifunctional complex and its tunnel support catalysis using the CODH/ACS from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans as a model. Although CODH/ACS adapted to form a stable bifunctional complex with a secluded substrate tunnel, catalysis and CO transport is even more efficient when two monofunctional enzymes are coupled. Efficient CO channeling appears to be ensured by hydrophobic binding sites for CO, which act in a bucket&#8208;brigade fashion rather than as a simple tube. Tunnel remodeling showed that opening the tunnel increased activity but impaired directed transport of CO. Constricting the tunnel impaired activity and CO transport, suggesting that the tunnel evolved to sequester CO rather than to maximize turnover.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Dynamic Structure and Bond Evolutions in BiOIO3 Photocatalysts during CO2 Reduction</title>

                We have established a correlation between photocatalytic activity and dynamic structure/bond evolutions of BiOIO3&#8208;based photocatalysts during CO2 reduction by combining operando X&#8208;ray diffraction with photoelectron spectroscopy. More specifically, the selective photo&#8208;deposition of PtOx species on BiOIO3 (010) facets could effectively promote the electron enrichment on Bi active sites of (100) facets for facilitating the adsorption/activation of CO2 molecules, leading to the formation of Bi sites with high oxidation state and the shrink of crystalline structures. With introducing light irradiation to drive CO2 reduction, the Bi active sites with high oxidation states transformed into normal Bi3+ state, accompanying with the expansion of crystalline structures. Owing to the dynamic structure, bond, and chemical&#8208;state evolutions, a significant improvement of photocatalytic activity for CO evolution has been achieved on PtOx&#8208;BiOIO3 (195.0 &#956;mol g&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1), much higher than the pristine (61.9 &#956;mol g&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1) as well as metal&#8208;Pt decorated BiOIO3 (70.3 &#956;mol g&#8208;1&#8226;h&#8208;1) samples. This work provides new insights to correlate the intrinsically dynamic structure/bond evolutions with CO2 reduction activity, which may help to guide future photocatalyst design.</description>

                Ni/CeO2 catalysts were synthesized to evaluate the effect of varying Ni concentration on the CeO2 structure, studying their structural and catalytic properties in the conversion of CO2 to CH4. The impact of Ni concentration on the Ni/CeO2 catalyst properties was evaluated by TG-DTA-DTG, FTIR, XRD, nitrogen physisorption, SEM, and TEM-EDS analyses. XPS analyses of Ce 3d, Ni 2p, and O 1s were conducted to understand the surface structural organization of these catalysts. In situ monitoring followed by Quick-XAS during activation was performed to obtain results on chemical species that may coexist in the catalytic reduction process and evaluate the performance of each catalyst in the reduction process. Ni-O-Ce solid solutions were identified by MCR-ALS analysis, and their importance in CO2 methanation was discussed throughout this work. The catalytic activity of catalysts with a balanced phase between Ni-O-Ce solid solutions and Ni0 metallic area proved more efficient.</description>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction is a promising method for converting atmospheric CO2 into valuable low&#8208;carbon chemicals. In this study, a crystalline cadmium sulfide/amorphous cadmium hydroxide composite was successfully deposited on the carbon paper substrate surface by in&#8208;situ chemical bath deposition (named as c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrodes) for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce CO. The c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode exhibited high CO Faradaic efficiencies (&gt;90%) under a wide potential window of 1.0 V, with the highest value reaching ~100% at the applied potential ranging from &#8722;2.16 V to &#8722;2.46 V vs. ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+), superior to the crystalline counterpart c&#8208;CdS/CP and c&#8208;CdS/c&#8208;Cd(OH)2@CP electrodes. Meanwhile, the CO partial current density reached up to 154.7 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;2.76 V vs. Fc/Fc+ on the c&#8208;CdS/a&#8208;Cd(OH)2/CP electrode. The excellent performance of this electrode was mainly ascribed to its special three&#8208;dimensional structure and the introduction of a&#8208;Cd(OH)2. These structures could provide more active sites, accelerate the charge transfer, and enhance adsorption of *COOH intermediates, thereby improving the CO selectivity. Moreover, the electrolytes consisting of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate and acetonitrile also enhanced the reaction kinetics of electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO.</description>

                The rational design of copper (Cu)-based catalysts with different oxidation states is essential to achieve highly selective and efficient CO2 electroreduction. However, the effect of different oxide states of Cu-based catalysts has rarely been studied. Herein, the reaction mechanism of CO2 hydrogenation into CO on Cu-based catalysts with different oxidation states, such as Cu(1 1 1), Cu2O(1 1 1) and CuO(1 1 1), was studied using the density functional theory. The most favored pathway for CO production and the rate-controlling step on the three catalyst models were determined. The results show that, Cu2O (1 1 1) shows the best catalytic activity among the three catalysts due to the lowest activation barrier. The electronic structure analysis shows that Cu2O has the proper electronic structure to activate CO2 which is further reduced to CO. This work provides an important insight on the effect of oxidation state of Cu-based catalysts on the reduction of CO2 to CO.</description>

                Bipolar membranes (BPM) are a special class of ion-exchange membranes constituted by a cation- and an anion-exchange layer, allowing the generation of protons and hydroxide ions via water dissociation. This unique feature makes them useful in a wide range of application. In this work, we have fabricated a novel BPM, with SnO2 hollow spheres used as water dissociation catalyst. Such fabricated BPM has been served as a diaphragm to construct a three-chamber electrolyzer for CO2 electro-reduction to CO in organic electrolyte. During the long-term electrolysis process, the cathodic current density has reached to &#8764;96.5 mA&#183;cm-2, with the Faraday efficiency of CO stabled at &#8764;92.6%. Compared with widely used commercial BPM, as-prepared BPM exhibited many advantages, such as lower hydrolysis over-potential, high catalytic efficiency and low total resistance. This technology extends the prospect of BPM application in the field of CO2 reduction.</description>

      <title>Understanding membrane-intensified catalytic CO2 reduction reactions to methanol by structure-based multisite micro-kinetic model</title>

                Membrane reactor processes can be used to overcome the constraints of the chemical rate equilibrium of methanol (MeOH) synthesis products. In this thermodynamics-limited work, three different selective sulfonated poly(ether ether ketones) (SPEEK) membranes were applied in an engineered unit operation with a commercial Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 surface catalyst for several CO2/CO-involving chemistries. A detailed mathematical model with micro-kinetics was developed, optimised and utilised to assess the vessel with barrier by using CERRES (Chemical Reaction and Reactor Engineering Simulations). Scaled separation tests were described by the integrated reference values of permeance. The permeability for all compound molecules (H2, H2O, CO, CO2, MeOH&#8230;) was determined by adjusting parameters to account for the experimental gas composition on the permeate, interface and retention segment side after reduction. The specific kinetic characteristics of the mechanism of elementary step reactions were analysed in fixed bed design. A comparison of the estimated data prediction for the packed system with related definite numbers showed excellent statistical agreement. Similarly, a very good reliability was obtained between the results for 3 SPEEK membrane cases. Thus, the defined particular evaluations of derived theoretical expressions were benchmarked accurately. Although (validated) performance, i.e. the yield of MeOH, was overestimated, discrepancy was not so large so as to simulate behaviour verily. The (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (polyamide) over a SPEEK layer performed best for intensification. Herein, the pressurised (&gt;50 bar) CO2 hydrogenation pathway was not only shifted by in situ removal as a proof of concept, but also modelled intrinsically, considering transport phenomena resistances, adsorption and desorption as well. The storage of hydrogen can benefit from MeOH production reengineering.</description>

      <title>Dual Role of a Novel heteroleptic Cu(I) Complex in Visible&#8208;Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202400765</link>
      <description>Cecilia Bruschi, Xuchun Gui, Pascal Rauthe, Olaf Fuhr, Andreas&#8208;Neil Unterreiner, Wim Klopper, Carla Bizzarri, Chemistry. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396904532

                A novel mononuclear Cu(I) complex was synthesized via coordination with a benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one&#8208;1,2,3&#8208;triazole chelating diimine and the bis[(2&#8208;diphenylphosphino)phenyl] ether (DPEPhos), to target a new and efficient photosensitizer for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The Cu(I) complex absorbs in the blue&#8208;green region of the visible spectrum, with a broad band having a maximum at 475 nm (&#949; = 4500 M&#8208;1cm&#8208;1), which is assigned to the metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition from the Cu(I) to the benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8217;&#8208;one moiety of the diimine. Surprisingly, photo&#8208;driven experiments for the CO2 reduction showed that this complex can undergo a photoinduced electron transfer with a sacrificial electron donor and accumulate electrons on the diimine backbone. Photo&#8208;driven experiments in a CO2 atmosphere revealed that this complex can not only act as a photosensitizer, when combined with an Fe(III)&#8208;porphyrin, but can also selectively produce CO from CO2. Thus, owing to its charge&#8208;accumulation properties, the non&#8208;innocent benzoquinoxalin&#8208;2&#8208;one based ligand enabled the development of the first copper(I)&#8208;based photocatalyst for CO2 reduction.</description>

      <title>Biological S0 reduction at neutral (pH 6.9) and acidic (pH 3.8) conditions: Performance and microbial community shifts in a H2/CO2-fed bioreactor</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.11.592705</link>

                Sulfidogenesis is a promising technology for the selective recovery of chalcophile bulk metals (e.g. Cu, Zn, and Co) from metal-contaminated waters such as acid mine drainage (AMD) and metallurgy waste streams. The use of elemental sulfur (S0) instead of sulfate (SO42-) as electron acceptor reduces electron donor requirements four-fold, lowering process costs, and expands the range of operating conditions to more acidic pH. We previously reported autotrophic S0 reduction using an industrial mesophilic granular sludge as inoculum under thermoacidophilic conditions. Here, we examined the effect of pH on the S0 reduction performance of the same inoculum, in a continuously fed gas-lift reactor run at 30 C under neutral (pH 6.9) and acidic (pH 3.8) conditions. Steady-state volumetric sulfide production rates (VSPR) dropped 2.3-fold upon transition to acidic pH, from 1.79 g L-1 d-1 S2- to 0.71 g L-1 d-1 S2- Microbial community analysis via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing showed that at pH 6.9, the S0-reducing genera Sulfurospirillum, Sulfurovum, Desulfurella, and Desulfovibrio were present at the highest relative abundance, while at pH 3.9 Desulfurella dominated the sequenced reads. The detection of acetic acid and the relative abundance of Acetobacterium at pH 6.9 pointed towards acetogenesis, explaining the dominance of the heterotrophic genus Sulfurospirillum in this H2 and CO2-fed bioreactor.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Origin of Graphene Anchored Single Palladium Atom for Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Syngas with Tunable CO/H2 Ratios</title>

      <description>Fuhua Li, Qing Tang, ChemCatChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4397013207

                Pd based catalysts are rare metal&#8208;based catalyst to yield tunable CO/H2 ratios for Fischer&#8208;Tropsch synthesis. How to achieve the co&#8208;production of CO and H2 with as little Pd as possible is extremely meaningful for Cn industry. Recent experiment revealed single Pd atom anchored on graphene exhibits high activity for CO2 electroreduction to syngas, yet the origin of activity and controllable CO/H2 ratios, especially the exact Pd coordination structure, remains elusive. Here we employ grand&#8208;canonical density functional theory to show that Pd&#8208;N1, rather than the commonly accepted Pd&#8208;N4, serves as the active center, and the charge&#8208;carrying capability is an effective descriptor. The site with more Pd&#8209;C coordination can better submerge in graphene's delocalized &#960; electrons for higher charge&#8208;carrying capacity to carry excess charges that occupy Pd 4dz2 orbital and promote electron injection. Importantly, the tunable CO/H2 ratio can be explained with difference in charge&#8208;carrying capability of transition state for *COOH and *H2 formation. This work solves the puzzle of coordinating structure of Pd active site and demonstrates the important role of charge&#8208;carrying capability in electrochemical process, which shall provide a reference for further exploration of efficient electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Financial Efficiency and Renewable Energy Consumption on CO2 Emissions Reduction in GCC Economies: A Panel Data Quantile Regression Approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202405.0997.v1</link>

                As prominent oil producers, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have played a significant role in the global energy market. However, as the world's attention increasingly shifts towards environmental sustainability, understanding the implications of the GCC's economic activities on CO2 emissions becomes indispensable. This research paper investigates the relationship between specific economic indicators and their impact on CO2 emissions in the GCC from 2001 to 2021. The study employs quantile regression, a powerful statistical method that estimates the conditional quantiles of a response variable given a set of predictor variables. The findings reveal several important insights: Financial institution efficiency is significant and negative at a 1% level at the lower (10th) -83537.3 and the higher quantile (90th) -549002.3. The relationship between GDP per capita and CO2 emissions varies across quantiles, highlighting the complexity of the growth-environment nexus. Total patents exhibit a positive and significant relationship with emissions, underscoring the importance of directing innovation towards environmentally sustainable solutions. Renewable energy consumption displays a nuanced relationship with CO2 emissions, with a stronger negative impact observed at higher consumption levels. This underscores the potential of renewable energy to mitigate emissions when integrated at scale. The study's outcomes hold crucial policy implications for the GCC countries as they seek to align economic growth with environmental sustainability. The findings emphasize the importance of fostering financial institution efficiency, promoting green innovation, and expanding renewable energy sources to reduce emissions</description>

      <title>Charting a path to low-carbon leadership: unlocking up to 90% emissions reductions in greenfield LNG</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23278</link>
      <description>Peter Carydias, Simon Flowers, No host. 64(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396975614

                The liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry stands at the cusp of a transformation driven by the climate imperative. Focussing on the Middle Arm Industrial Precinct, this paper shows how carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are being reduced in a proposed world-class LNG project by assessing, screening and selecting known technologies using a Marginal Abatement philosophy linked to key emissions drivers. (1) We propose a new breed of electrified LNG facilities that could deliver an up to 90% reduction in CO2 intensity. (2) We show that through developing strategic partnerships in upstream renewable power, hydrogen supply, and enabled downstream carbon capture and storage (CCS), the significant low carbon energy requirements of an LNG facility can be delivered. (3) We discuss a Marginal Abatement assessment strategy which ensures a pathway to viable lowest cost opportunities selected in an &#8216;Avoid &amp; Mitigate&#8217; first approach. This proposed strategy ensures that CO2 emission reduction opportunities are assessed and selected consistently to determine both a lifecycle cost ($) and volume (tons CO2e) of emission reduction. These innovative strategies collectively articulate a roadmap for a low carbon future for LNG and other heavy industrial industries, underlining Australia&#8217;s potential to become a leading provider of low-carbon natural resources.</description>

      <title>Can Australia become APAC&#8217;s CCS hub of choice?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23228</link>

                Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is critical in Australia for future production of lower-carbon natural gas for domestic use and international export. There may also be targeted applications in other sectors, such as electricity, industrial heat generation and manufacturing, but only a small portion of the country&#8217;s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are likely to be addressed with carbon capture. That leaves significant CO2 storage potential untapped. Wood Mackenzie&#8217;s analysis suggests that Australia&#8217;s CCS opportunity lies less in the reduction of domestic emissions, and more in enabling other countries&#8217; net zero ambitions. This involves building hubs to transport and store CO2 at scale, using Australia&#8217;s vast geological resources. Such hubs are major capital projects and typically require billions of dollars of investment. However, supporting CO2 storage hubs with public funding may feel like a bitter policy pill to swallow, if there is not a large Australian emissions reduction number on the other side of it. So, why should Australia put its money towards this, and fast? In this paper, we will size the economic opportunity, benchmark Australia&#8217;s competitiveness with other aspiring hubs in the region and assess the amount of investment and policies required to get there.</description>

                The paper analyses European trends in reducing emissions of harmful substances and carbon dioxide. Today, the problem of increasing CO2 is an acute one, and thus the task of decarbonising the planet is an important task for the global community. Along with this, the negative impact of other pollutants, such as NOx and SO2, on the environmental situation in Ukraine and the world as a whole is also important.In order to reduce the amount of polluting gases in the air of Ukraine, it was decided to turn to the experience and practice of the European Union (EU) countries and analyse what has already been done, as well as what is planned to be done in this direction in the coming decades. To this end, we analysed the actual data on the reduction of CO2, NOx, and SO2 emissions by European countries and compared their plans for further emission reductions in the coming years.The theoretical data of the study on the actual reduction of air pollutant and carbon dioxide emissions by European countries, as well as their plans for further reduction of these emissions, are of practical importance, as they show global trends in this problem of global importance and should be applied in all future energy plans both in Ukraine and other countries where this is not taken into account. Therefore, an effective and scientifically based plan for energy saving, clean energy production, and diversification of energy resources is needed to accelerate the transition to clean energy, increase energy independence from unreliable suppliers and unstable supplies of imported fossil fuels (in particular, accelerated phase-out of russian fossil fuels by 2030, which are used by the aggressor as an economic and political weapon), and help solve the climate crisis.</description>

      <title>Effect of Calcium Peroxide on the Food Waste Composting Process</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.59324/ejtas.2024.2(3).04</link>
      <description>Wafula Gerald Nalume, S. A. Seif, Lena Omina Obel, European journal of theoretical and applied sciences. 2(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396978636

                Aerobic composting acknowledged as a crucial technology in the management of food waste, offers a potential approach to sustainable production practices by producing top-notch organic fertilizers and soil conditioners. Nevertheless, the natural process of composting contributes to environmental pollution by releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. This study examines the effectiveness of adding calcium peroxide to the composting process to improve the availability of oxygen, reduce CO2 emissions, and enhance the quality of the final products. The study involved conducting experimental trials using different doses of calcium peroxide (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) to evaluate its effect on reducing CO2 levels. The results demonstrate a substantial decrease in CO2 emissions, where concentrations of 20% lead to a reduction of 36.82%while in 5%, 10%, and 15% the reductions were 19.15%,26.36%, and 36.32%, respectively. In addition, the inclusion of calcium peroxide raises the pH of food waste samples and introduces calcium ions (Ca2+) into the end product. The results emphasize the significance of dealing with carbon emissions in composting procedures to adhere to Sustainable Development Goals 12 (responsible consumption and production) and 13 (climate action), thus progressing towards more sustainable waste management techniques.</description>

      <title>A review of atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration pathways; processes and current status in Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccst.2024.100208</link>
      <description>Ugwudike Patrick O, Michael A. Oladunjoye, Olatunbosun Alao, Carbon capture science &amp; technology. 12(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396883958

                Increased world energy demand due to population and rapid technological growth, and urbanisation has induced climatic change through increased atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration, of which the atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategies have been identified as the pertinent pathway towards the reduction of this GHG. These CDRs serve as an adaptation and mitigation approach to abate the impacts of climate change. Different CDR strategies are encapsulated in the term Carbon sequestration, describing natural and technological approaches by which carbon dioxide (CO2) is removed from the atmosphere. Technologically, Carbon Capture Use and Storage (CCUS) is a CDR strategy that encompasses both carbon capture and storage (CSS) and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technologies. Its developmental pathways and implementation depend on understanding the natural carbon source and sink contained in the natural carbon cycle and CO2 capture technology. CCS technologies capture CO2 from large point sources, mainly power plants and industrial processes and store it in underground geological formations that include the deep saline aquifer, depleted oil and gas reservoirs, unminable coal seams and oceanic basaltic formations. The captured CO2 is also stored through in-situ mineral carbonation and direct ocean injection. Other processes that enhance CO2 removal include ocean fertilisation, ocean alkalinity enhancement and marine/terrestrial photosynthetic conversion, which stores CO2 in the pedosphere or surface ocean relative to natural carbon sequestration. CCU is a CCS complimentary technology that converts the captured CO2 into value-added products through CO2- ex-situ mineralization, value-added storage (enhanced oil/gas recovery, enhanced geothermal system, and enhanced coalbed/shale gas recovery) and CO2- chemical feedstock and biofuels. At present, there is no CCUS project in Nigeria. However, different preliminary site characterisation studies have been carried out for CCUS project development, which is being delayed by a lack of funding, robust policies, and public awareness.</description>

                Pig farmhouses face unprecedented challenges in meeting the growing demand to feed an increasing population. To do so, these farms contribute significantly to the production of approximately 35 % of the world's NH3 emissions, a highly harmful air pollutant. In response to this critical environmental issue, the CO2 Management Pig Slurry Strategy (CO2-MPS) proposes an innovative solution to mitigate NH3 emissions by leveraging the biogenic CO2 produced within pig farmhouses. This groundbreaking Carbon Dioxide Utilization (CDU) approach based on utilizing this biogenic CO2 to form a protective blanket over pig manure lagoons promises the reduction of over 8 million metric tons of NH3 emissions annually. Such NH3 emissions are well-documented initiators of Particulate Matter, particularly PM2.5, highlighting the potential positive impact on air quality of this strategy.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of hydrogen production pathways for emethanol synthesis to decarbonise industry</title>

      <description>Bhrat Bobby Daswani, A. Campbell, No host. 64(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396974632

                Methane pyrolysis and water electrolysis offer alternative hydrogen pathways to methane reforming that utilise renewable power and avoid generating carbon dioxide (CO2). On a scope 1 and 2 basis, both technologies have the potential to generate carbon neutral emethanol fuel when combined with biogenic CO2. However, pyrolysis requires significantly less energy and has a lower capital expenditure (CAPEX). Being a more nascent technology, it also has upside potential for cost reductions and valorisation of the solid carbon by-product can yield lower hydrogen costs than the incumbent technology, however, limited demand from existing markets is a potential constraint. Industry decarbonisation is constrained due to a lack of available renewables and hydrogen infrastructure. Pyrolysis offers a potential cost-effective use of the available renewable assets in the early stages while the carbon by-product is not a constraint and until sufficient renewable infrastructure is in place to support water electrolysis at a cost-effective scale.</description>

      <title>Development of long-distance and large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) value chain using liquefied CO2 ship transportation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23085</link>
      <description>Daein Cha, No host. 64(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396974846

                Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is central to clean energy transition. Globally, potential aggregated carbon dioxide (CO2) storage resource capacity is ~13,000 billion tonnes. Assuming global greenhouse gas emissions of 51 billion tonnes per annum, CO2 storage capacity equates to 250 years of global emissions reduction. While there is significant momentum to deploy CCS technology for meeting Paris Agreement targets, the key challenge for offering CCS to all industrial sectors is that many major CO2 emission sources are located hundreds of kilometres away from geological storage sites. To address this key challenge, there is a need to develop a long-distance and large-scale CCS value chain that utilises liquefied CO2 (LCO2) ship transportation. This paper discusses key technical, commercial, and regulatory considerations that must be addressed in parallel for developing such a CCS value chain. More specifically, it will cover the following: (1) technical &#8211; CO2 liquefaction condition, CO2 supply specification and LCO2 ship parcel size; (2) commercial &#8211; business model (ownership of CO2 retained by emitters or transferred to CCS project proponent), CO2 supply or CCS facility lease terms and conditions; and (3) regulatory &#8211; domestic versus transboundary projects and associated needs for policy and legislative underpinning.</description>

                The exploitation of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a sustainable, plentiful, and harmless C1 source for the catalytic synthesis of enantioenriched carboxylic acids has long been acknowledged as a pivotal task in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we present a current-driven nickel-catalyzed reductive carboxylation reaction with CO2 fixation, facilitating the formation of C(sp3)&#8211;C(sp2) bonds by circumventing the handling of moisture-sensitive organometallic reagents. This electroreductive protocol serves as a practical platform, paving the way for the synthesis of enantioenriched propargylic carboxylic acids (up to 98% enantiomeric excess) from racemic propargylic carbonates and CO2. The efficacy of this transformation is exemplified by its successful utilization in the asymmetric total synthesis of (S)-arundic acid, (R)-PIA, (S)-chizhine D, (S)-cochlearin G, and (S,S)-alexidine, thereby underscoring the potential of asymmetric electrosynthesis to achieve complex molecular architectures sustainably.</description>

                The urban carbon footprint (UCF) is an important tool for assessing an organization&#8217;s ecological impacts and in guiding sustainability efforts. This calculation is usually measured in tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq). Calculations provide important data to determine strategies to reduce the carbon footprint and establish sustainability targets. Various standards and protocols guide UCF calculation, and many organizations aim to make these data transparent to their stakeholders and the public. This study aims to calculate the UCF of Sar&#305;&#231;am Municipality (SM) in the Adana Province of T&#252;rkiye. This study includes the greenhouse gas emission inventories resulting from all activities of the SM main service building, guest house, construction site service building, Cultural Center service building, and additional service buildings between 1 January 2022 and 31 December 2022. The calculations include generator fuel consumption, electricity consumption, the refrigerant gas leaks and refills resulting from these activities, the fuel consumed in vehicles owned by the company or whose fuel consumption is under company control, emissions originating from personal travel, emissions originating from customers and visitors, emissions originating from business travel, purchases, etc. Emissions from products purchased and emissions from waste transportation are included. The findings show that, in 2022, the total UCF of SM was equal to 10,862.46 tons of CO2-eq. The Paris Agreement aims to reduce the per capita emissions to approximately two tons of CO2-eq by 2030. The carbon footprint per employee within the municipality was calculated at 12.43 tons of CO2-eq, as derived from the analyzed data. The results reveal the importance of implementing sustainable practices and strategies within SM, such as energy efficiency measures, waste reduction, and the adoption of renewable energy sources, to mitigate its carbon footprint. This study plans to provide a basis for SM&#8217;s reduction efforts by keeping greenhouse gas emissions under control.</description>

                Abstract We study Japan&#8217;s net-zero emissions target by 2050 in a multi-model framework, focusing on residual emissions and carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Four energy-economic and integrated assessment models show similar but stronger strategies for the net-zero target, compared to the previous, low-carbon policy target (80% emissions reduction). Results indicate that around 90% (inter-model median) of the current emissions are reduced through abatement, including improved energy efficiency and cleaner electricity and fuels. Models deploy new options such as CDR based on carbon capture and storage (CCS) (bioenergy with CCS and direct air carbon dioxide capture and storage) and hydrogen to achieve net zero. The scale of CCS-based CDR deployment reaches an inter-model median of 132Mt-CO2/yr. The median hydrogen share of final energy in 2050 increases from 0.79% to 6.9% between the low-carbon and net-zero scenarios. The CDR sensitivity analysis reveals that limiting the use of CDR significantly increases the mitigation costs for net zero. Achieving Japan&#8217;s net-zero goal will require exploring methods to reduce residual emissions, including demand-side solutions, and accelerating responsible CDR policies.</description>

      <title>Influence of Carbon Dioxide on Micro-cracking in Calcite: An Atomistic Scale Investigation</title>

                In candidate formations for geological Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite) are ubiquitously presented. The dynamic process of chemically induced alteration on carbonate-rich reservoirs due to the injection of supercritical CO2 holds paramount importance for achieving an economic injectivity and structural integrity of the system. How carbonate rocks undergo deterioration and particularly how microcracks develop in the presence of carbon dioxide remain largely unknown. Here we employ a powerful tool of reactive force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, investigating into the impact of representative CO2 environments on Mode I tensile crack propagation in calcite at micro-scale. Our simulation results demonstrate that (1) both dry and wet CO2 environments favor the tensile crack propagation by lowering the fracture toughness of the pre-existing crack; (2) the wet CO2 environment promotes the growth velocity of the subcritical crack compared to the dry CO2 environment, under the same mechanical loading condition; (3) the interaction between the stressed crack and the CO2-water mixture diffusing into the crack opening leads to a small reduction of the system potential energy at an initial stage of subcritical growth; (4) The crack tip appears to be sharper in both dry CO2 and wet CO2 environments, albeit at a lower stress intensity factor than the vacuum case. The atomistic scale findings provide new insights on the process of subcritical calcite cracking induced by a reactive environment via CO2 injection, prior to the damage-enhanced dissolution phase.</description>

      <title>Soil management practices can contribute to net carbon neutrality in California</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad4b41</link>
      <description>Alan Di Vittorio, Maegen Simmonds, A. D. Jones, Whendee L. Silver, Benjamin Z. Houlton, M. S. Torn, Maya Almaraz, Peter Nico, Environmental research letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396883227

                Abstract Stabilizing climate requires reducing greenhouse gas emissions and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in land or ocean systems. Soil management practices can reduce greenhouse gas emissions or sequester atmospheric CO2 into inorganic and organic forms. However, whether soil carbon strategies represent a viable and impactful climate mitigation pathway is uncertain. A specific question concerns the role that land-management practices and soil amendments can play in realizing California&#8217;s ambition for carbon neutrality by 2045. Here we examine the carbon flux impacts of soil conservation (i.e., compost, reduced tillage, cover crop) and enhanced silicate rock weathering (EW) practices at different areal extents of implementation in cropland, grassland, and savanna in California under two climate change cases. We show that with implementation areas of 15% or 50% of private cultivated land, grassland, and savanna in California, soil conservation practices alone can contribute &#12310;1.4&#12311;_0.7^2.1 % ( -&#12310;1.8&#12311;_(-0.9)^(-2.7) Mt CO2eq y-1) and &#12310;4.6&#12311;_2.3^6.9 % (&#12310;-6.0&#12311;_(-3.0)^(-8.9) Mt CO2eq y-1) of the additional emissions reduction needed (beyond previous targets) to meet the 2045 net neutrality goal (-129.3 Mt CO2eq y-1), respectively, on an average annual basis, including climate uncertainty. Including EW in these scenarios increases the total contributions of management practices to &#12310;4.1&#12311;_2.5^5.6 % (&#12310;-5.2&#12311;_(-3.2)^(-7.3) Mt CO2eq y-1) and &#12310;13.5&#12311;_8.2^18.6 % (&#12310;-17.5&#12311;_(-10.7)^(-24.2) Mt CO2eq y-1), respectively, of this reduction. This highlights that the extent of implementation area is a major factor in determining benefits and that EW has the potential to make a real contribution to net reduction targets. Results are similar across climate cases, indicating that contemporary field data can be used to make future projections. With EW there remains mechanistic uncertainties, however, such as rock dissolution rate and environmental controls on weathering products, which require additional field research to improve understanding of the technological efficacy of this approach for California&#8217;s 2045 carbon neutrality goal.</description>

      <title>Study on the Mechanism of Carbon Dioxide Miscible Fracturing Fluid Huff and Puff in Enhanced Oil Recovery</title>

                Carbon dioxide (CO2) miscible fracturing huff-and-puff technology now plays a pivotal role in enhancing crude oil recovery rates, particularly in reservoirs with challenging physical properties, strong water sensitivity, high injection pressure, and complex water-injection dynamics. In this study, the oil-increasing mechanism and huff-and-puff effect of CO2 miscible fracturing fluid are investigated through a comprehensive experimental approach. Specifically, experiments on PVT gas injection expansion, minimum miscible pressure, and CO2 miscible fracturing fluid huff and puff are conducted on the G fault block reservoir of the J Oilfield. The experimental findings demonstrate that injecting CO2 into reservoirs leads to an expansion in oil volume, a reduction in viscosity, and an increase in saturation pressure. Crude oil extraction is further enhanced by the addition of solubilizers and viscosity reducers. The use of solubilizers not only increases oil recovery rates but also reduces the minimum miscible pressure required for effective CO2 dispersion. We also found that shut-in times, permeability, and the huff-and-puff method used all have considerable impacts on huff-and-puff recovery rates. This study offers valuable technical insights, supporting the application of CO2 miscible fracturing huff-and-puff technology to enhance oil recovery rates in low-permeability reservoirs.</description>

                The development of synthetic microorganisms that could use one-carbon compounds, such as carbon dioxide, methanol, or formate, has received considerable interest. In this study, we engineered Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae to both synthetic methylotrophy and formatotrophy, enabling them to co-utilize methanol or formate with CO2 fixation through a synthetic C1-compound assimilation pathway (MFORG pathway). This pathway consisted of a methanol-formate oxidation module and the reductive glycine pathway. We first assembled the MFORG pathway in P. pastoris using endogenous enzymes, followed by blocking the native methanol assimilation pathway, modularly engineering genes of MFORG pathway, and compartmentalizing the methanol oxidation module. These modifications successfully enabled the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris to utilize both methanol and formate. We then introduced the MFORG pathway from P. pastoris into the model yeast S. cerevisiae, establishing the synthetic methylotrophy and formatotrophy in this organism. The resulting strain could also successfully utilize both methanol and formate with consumption rates of 20 mg/L/h and 36.5 mg/L/h, respectively. The ability of the engineered P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae to co-assimilate CO2 with methanol or formate through the MFORG pathway was also confirmed by 13C-tracer analysis. Finally, production of 5-aminolevulinic acid and lactic acid by co-assimilating methanol and CO2 was demonstrated in the engineered P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae. This work indicates the potential of the MFORG pathway in developing different hosts to use various one-carbon compounds for chemical production.</description>

      <title>Megawatts to methane &#8211; a deep drop in emissions reduction transition for existing regional gas-based ammonia plants</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23066</link>
      <description>Jacob de Boer, No host. 64(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396974925

                Synthetic ammonia production sustains food production for more than half of the world&#8217;s population. Many regional ammonia plants convert all ammonia to ammonium nitrate fertiliser. With these, all carbon in the feed ends up as carbon dioxide (CO2), with around 2 tonnes of CO2 released per tonne of ammonia produced using natural gas. Conveniently, ammonia plants produce a substantial pre-concentrated CO2 stream. Ammonia plants are high-capex, long-life assets that operate for 40+ years. With the energy transition, replacing such assets is very high cost and will dramatically impact the cost of food production. Further, green energy is highly variable, leading to the need for additional supply side assets to stabilise energy supply. This paper outlines a transition approach for a 30% CO2 reduction (also a 43% case) to extend the useful life of these assets while re-using much of the plant, with the ability to turn on/off the green energy with minimal disruption for stable operation. The example plant is based on a typical 750 tpd ammonia gas Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) plant. The approach considers adding and integrating green power and biogas into this plant to reduce net reportable CO2 emissions. Methanation of CO2 has been demonstrated in several projects and is considered key in developing a transition pathway for an existing gas-based plant, extending its operational life and flexibility to operate with varying degrees of variable green energy supply. Further, whilst Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) is used in this case, the approach can be beneficially applied with methanol and other Power-to-X opportunities.</description>

      <title>Emissions reduction in LNG production facilities through emerging post-combustion carbon capture and storage technologies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23150</link>
      <description>David T. Kearns, No host. 64(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396974666

                The liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector relies extensively on gas turbines for on-site power generation and to drive refrigeration compressors. They provide an efficient and reliable energy source for LNG operations in remote locations. With upcoming changes to the Safeguard Mechanism in Australia, there is an increased focus on Scope 1 emissions, so management and targeted reduction are a priority to reduce liabilities. Despite technology advancements, gas turbines remain one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in LNG production facilities. Also, in Australia, many facilities are not grid-connected, meaning that displacement of Scope 1 emissions through renewable electricity sourcing is a challenge. To develop deeper cuts in Scope 1 emissions, one solution is to deploy post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) on existing gas turbines, with the potential to reduce associated emissions by over 90%. Globally, a number of LNG facilities are already deploying CCS to permanently store reservoir CO2 from the LNG processing trains. Several Australian LNG facilities are located in close proximity to potential CO2 storage reservoirs, meaning that a coordinated approach to both reservoir and post-combustion CO2 should be considered when sizing pipelines, shipping systems and storage wells to optimise and leverage the required investment. This paper outlines the technological, economic and policy aspects of integrating both reservoir post-combustion CCS on LNG facilities, including barriers and opportunities for deployment. It will discuss new developments and enablers for CCS to be more widely deployed at LNG production sites.</description>

      <title>The role and deployment timing of direct air capture in Saudi Arabia&#8217;s net-zero transition</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad4a8f</link>
      <description>Qin Yang, Gokul Iyer, Jay Fuhrman, Mohamad Hejazi, Puneet Kamboj, Page Kyle, Environmental research letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396850582

                Abstract The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has pledged to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2060. Direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) is critical for the country to meet its net-zero target given its reliance on fossil fuels and limited options for carbon dioxide removal (CDR). However, the role of DACCS in KSA&#8217;s national climate change mitigation has not been studied in the literature. In this study, we aim to understand the potential role of DACCS and the effect of its deployment timing in KSA&#8217;s transition toward its net-zero target using GCAM-KSA, which is a version of Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM) with KSA split out as an individual region. We find that the annual DACCS CO2 sequestration in KSA reaches 0.28 to 0.33 Gt/yr by 2060 depending on its deployment timing. Early DACCS deployment, driven by its early and rapid cost reduction worldwide, could bring significant savings (~420 billion USD during 2020&#172;&#172;&#8211;2060) in the cost of climate change mitigation in KSA, approximately 17% reduction relative to delayed DACCS deployment. Our study suggests a strong role for KSA to proactively invest in the R&amp;D of DACCS, initiate early DACCS deployment, and explore a broad suite of CDR options.</description>

      <title>Defining the geomechanical operating limits for subsurface CO2 storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23126</link>
      <description>Simon Holford, Mojtaba Rajabi, Scott D. Mildren, Robert G. King, Adam Bailey, No host. 64(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396977325

                Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical component of proposed pathways to limit global warming, though considerable upscaling is required to meet emissions reduction targets. Quantifying and managing the risks of fault reactivation is a leading barrier to scaling global CCS projects from current levels of ~40 million tonnes of carbon dioxide(CO2) per year (to target levels of several gigatonnes of CO2 per year), because CO2 injection into reservoirs can result in increased pore-fluid pressure and temperature changes, which can reduce the strength of rocks and faults and induce brittle failure. This can result in induced seismicity, whilst hydraulic fracturing of seals could provide pathways for CO2 leakage. Consequently, identifying favourable geomechanical conditions (typically determined through data on pre-injection rock stress, mechanical and elastic properties, and pore-fluid pressures) to minimise deformation of reservoirs and seals represents a key challenge in the selection of safe and effective sites for CCS projects. Critically, however, such geomechanical data are typically spatially limited (i.e. restricted to wells) and mainly consist of pre-injection crustal stress orientation measurements, rather than a full 3D description of the stress tensor and related geomechanical properties. This paper reviews some key geomechanical issues and knowledge gaps (particularly those associated with data availability and limitations) that need to be understood to enable successful reservoir and seal management for CCS projects. We also highlight recent advances in multi-scale and dimensional geomechanical modelling approaches that can be used to assess sites for the secure storage of CO2 as well as other gases, including hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of temporal changes and influencing factors of carbon dioxide and methane fluxes at the water-gas interface of the Inner Mongolia section of the Yellow River</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1080/02705060.2024.2328704</link>
      <description>Aruhan, Xiaohong Wu, Wuyinga, Hongchu Bao, Yun Lang, Narentuya, Fang Liu, Liming Qi, Xiaoli Wang, Journal of freshwater ecology. 39(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396908757

                Global warming has evolved into a global environmental concern. Despite the significant impact of rivers on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, there remains a lack of wide quantification of emissions at high temporal resolution. This research investigated the characteristics of the CO2 exchange flux (FCO2) and CH4 exchange flux (FCH4) at the interface of water and gas, as well as the primary determinants that impact these fluxes, at both the seasonal and 24-h scales, in the Inner Mongolia section of the Yellow River (IMYR). FCO2 was 52.52 &#177; 78.26 mmol&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;d&#8722;1 in summer, which was higher than autumn (30.81 &#177; 51.24 mmol&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;d&#8722;1) and spring (-96.09 &#177; 264.31 mmol&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;d&#8722;1). FCH4 peaked in summer (928.45 &#177; 513.31 &#956;mol&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;d&#8722;1) and declined in the fall (326.76 &#177; 576.31 &#956;mol&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;d&#8722;1). The lowest FCH4 was recorded in spring (61.75 &#177; 190.26 &#956;mol&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;d&#8722;1). Wind speed (WS) and organic carbon mineralisation were the primary determinants of FCO2 at the seasonal scale, whereas temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) were the primary determinants of FCH4. Monitoring FCO2 and FCH4 at night revealed higher average levels than during the day. FCO2 was regulated by levels of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total phosphorus (TP) levels over a 24-h period, whereas FCH4 was regulated by levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) and total nitrogen (TN). Throughout the majority of the time period, the IMYR river segment emits carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Due to the fact that emission patterns and driving mechanisms of riverine CO2 and CH4 differ across time scales, it is necessary to conduct more precise observations with high spatial and temporal resolution in order to acquire the most reliable data and comprehend more targeted approaches to carbon emission reduction.</description>

      <title>Securing the Australian CCS project rollout by improving aspects of the GHG storage legislation: a discussion paper</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23193</link>
      <description>Geoffrey O&#8217;Brien, S G. S Morton, David Bason, No host. 64(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396974849

                The respective Federal petroleum and greenhouse-gas (GHG) storage legislation was examined in detail to understand the interactions between the technical requirements in the legislation, the overarching emissions-policy framework and the existing and likely future technical capabilities of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry. Key elements of the GHG legislation were then stress-tested using CCS project examples to determine applicability. The number of CCS projects required to meet the nation&#8217;s emission reduction targets over the next 5&#8211;25 years is high (probably between 20&#8211;40 projects of 4 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa)), but the existing 8&#8211;10 year approvals timeline provides only a maximum of 2.5 full project cycles to undertake 20&#8211;40 projects, a goal not considered possible without substantial regulatory reform. Opportunities for improvement should focus on facilitating a robust and rapid CCS project rollout and could include the following: changing the legislation to facilitate the accelerated utilisation of depleted petroleum fields to storage facilities, including allowing the progressive expansion of the awarded injection licence (IL); changing the concept of containment to emphasise carbon dioxide (CO2) plume management via assessing risk and potential impacts, not by artificial constraints into GHG permits and licences; including unitisation and combination pathways in the GHG legislation; &#8216;CO2 plume&#8217; is not defined in legislation, even though the spatial location of a plume is central to numerous approvals, such as declaration of storage, demonstrating containment and all measurement, monitoring and verification (MMV) programs; developing a framework to manage future CCS project interactions at a basin scale, as is undertaken in groundwater management onshore.</description>

      <description>Gianpiero Colangelo, Gianluigi Spirto, Marco Milanese, Arturo de Risi, Energy conversion and management. 311(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396883310

                In the face of increasing demand for hydrogen, a feasibility study is conducted on its production by using Renewable Energy Resources (RERs), especially from wind and solar sources, with the latter preferring photovoltaic technology. The analysis performed is based on climate data for the Province of Brindisi, Apulia, Italy. The various types of electrolyzers will be analyzed, ultimately choosing the one that best suits the case study under consideration. The technical aspect of the land consumption for RER exploitation until 2050 is analyzed for the Italian case of study and for the Apulia Region. For both the 200 MW and 100 MW RER Power Plants, an economic analysis is carried out on the opportunities for using hydrogen. In the last part of the economic analysis, the trade-off between the high specific investment cost and the Capacity Factor of Wind technologies is also investigated. The results show the affordability of building high-scale Wind Farms, harnessing the existing scale economies. The lowest Hydrogen selling price is achieved by the 200 MW Wind Farms equal to 222 &#8364;/MWh against 232 &#8364;/MWh of the 200 MW Photovoltaic (PV) Farm. Finally, the feasibility analysis considers also the greenhouse gas emission reduction by including in the economic analysis the carbon dioxide (CO2) Average Auction Clearing Price leading for the 200 MW Wind Farms to a hydrogen selling price equal to 191.2 &#8364;/MWh against 201 &#8364;/MWh of the 200 MW Photovoltaic Farm.</description>

                For over 50 years Gippsland Basin Joint Venture (GBJV) has been producing oil and gas from the Gippsland Basin. Through hard work, challenging the status quo and innovation, the business, the operation and the people have been on a transformational journey. You may have heard about our conventional expansion opportunities, Kipper-Tuna-Turrum development and Longford Gas Conditioning Plant, but have you heard about how GBJV is progressing carbon dioxide (CO2) to sales with BOC and Air Liquide or how the team has reduced flare by 46% since 2018? Have you heard how the team increased Longford&#8217;s capacity by 11% in 2022 to deliver the highest gas production since 2017 to meet market demand. Or about how we are transforming the operation through our Gippsland Asset Streamlining Project, where we will no longer have a Crude Stabilisation Plant or a Gas Plant 1 at Longford? We continue to focus on our reliable gas operation through upcoming projects such as Hastings Generation Project, and Kipper Compression Project while also pursuing meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions such as South East Australia Carbon Capture and Storage Project in the Gippsland Basin. Our transformation to a &#8216;Modern Australian Gas Business&#8217; has not only meant change for our facilities but also change for our people in how we work and the culture we have built. Every day, our teams work to supply essential energy to Australian homes and businesses while also being on a transformational journey to improve the sustainability of our operation and contribute to the energy transition.</description>

      <title>Decarbonisation &#8211; how are we tracking against plans</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23037</link>
      <description>Mitch Wilkes, No host. 64(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396974965

                Globally many countries have committed to reducing carbon dioxide emissions and their dependence on fossil fuels with most large emitting countries now committing to &#8216;net-zero&#8217; targets sometime in the second half of this century and earlier intermediate targets in 2030. With only 6 years to go until the deadline to meet 2030 emission reduction targets, what is the verdict? How are Australian and global emission reduction projects tracking? World electricity demand in 2022 was 28,500 TWh with 39.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted in the same year as a result. The global energy mix hasn&#8217;t changed much: fossil fuel consumption as a percentage of primary energy in 2022 remained steady at 82% and in July 2023 the International Energy Agency projected 2023 oil demand to be 102.1 million barrels a day, an all-time high. This paper will take a look at decarbonisation efforts around the world and provide an overview of what was targeted in previous years and compare it with what has actually been achieved. How far are we truly on the road to decarbonisation? Are decarbonisation initiatives including carbon capture, utilisation and storage, hydrogen projects, solar and wind farms providing the intended results? Incorporating recent key regulatory initiatives from governments around the world including the US, Australia and the EU, this paper will outline progress to date and attempt to show possible paths going forward in answering the question whether it is possible to achieve the proposed emission reduction targets in 6 years.</description>

                Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global economy slowdown. Sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s (SSA) economy is gradually recovering from the pandemic. This study examines whether climate change variables (such as temperature, carbon dioxide emissions) and technological innovation (measured by total patent applications) can forecast the economic recovery of 19 selected countries in SSA from 2000 to 2022. We applied Kernel-based Regularized Least Squares (KRLS), a machine learning technique, while controlling for financial development, human capital and inflation rates. Our findings indicate that climate change exerts a negative and significant influence on SSA's economic recovery. Specifically, rise in average annual surface temperature change and carbon dioxide emissions decrease in economic recovery. An increase in average technological innovation improves in economic recovery. Inflation rate is associated with reduction in economic recovery. We discuss policy implications and mechanisms through which technological innovation and climate change affect the SSA economy, offering practical policy suggestions.</description>

                Two structurally distinct and biologically privileged succinimide and isoindole heteroarenes bearing benzothiadiazinedioxide motif-centered hybrid conjugates are proficiently achieved through Rh(III)-catalyzed sequential C(sp2)&#8211;H bond activation, ortho-alkenylation and finally cascade intramolecular cyclization. The significant feature of this developed protocol is that the resulting diversely decorated heterocycles contain a quaternary carbon center and this has been coursed through atypical [4 + 1] annulation ignoring the prevalent [4 + 2]-cyclization pathway and interestingly the applied coupling partners (e.g., maleimide, maleate, and styrene) to materialize the protocol functioned only as C1 synthon. Furthermore, the selective reduction strategy enables to modify the hybrid conjugate of succinimide and benzothiazine dioxide to benzothiazine dioxide-based spirocyclic isoindolopyrrolidinedione skeleton following preferential reduction of one carbonyl group of imide functionality. Overall this methodology emerges to be easily handled, versatile, time-efficient, and manifests relatively unfamiliar spiro-cyclization and good functional group tolerance so easy to grab a library of the entirely new variant of decorated hybrid spiro-heterocyclic scaffolds.</description>

      <title>Copper-Based Nanomaterials in Electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/bk-2024-1466.ch006</link>
      <description>Fan Yang, Shuhui Sun, Jiahui Liu, S. Das, Ji&#8208;Min Zheng, ACS symposium series. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396893609

                Electrochemical reactions are those that occur on the surface of a charged catalyst, including carbon dioxide reduction reaction, hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reaction in total hydrolyzed water, anode fuel oxidation reaction, and cathode oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells and so on. Usually, active sites of these catalysts used in the aforementioned electrochemical reactions are noble metals like Pt, Pd, and Ru, which are limited by high cost and low reserves. In comparison, transition metals with low cost and high reserves are gradually used in these electrochemical fields, and have the potential to replace common noble metal catalytic materials. As a typical transition metal, copper is not the best choice as active site in catalysts for electrochemical reactions, but its properties offer unique characteristics in different electrochemical reactions. For example, in CO2RR process, moderate adsorption capacity of CO intermediates on Cu active site promotes the formation of a carbon-carbon bond, which will increase the proportion of multi-carbon products. In other electrochemical reactions, the use of copper can affect the electronic structure of other transition metal active sites to improve the catalytic capacity. Therefore, this chapter gives an overview of the application of copper used as active site or dopant in the field of electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>Study on carbon emissions towards flange connection joints of assembled steel structures</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s44242-024-00036-8</link>
      <description>Jianpeng Guo, Yanxia Zhang, Ming-zhao Zheng, Xi Zhao, Bobo Wu, Low-carbon materials and green construction. 2(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4397293942

                Abstract In order to comply with the trend of global climate change, countries are gradually promoting energy conservation and emission reduction, and prefabricated buildings have become one of the main paths for the construction industry to develop towards carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. This paper takes the box-shaped column flange connection achieved by plug welding-core sleeve in the dormitory building of Tongzhou Campus of the Affiliated High School of Capital Normal University in China as the research object. Based on the consumption quota of prefabricated construction projects and the actual project quantity, the carbon emissions of steel structure column connection joints at different phases are calculated by the emission factor method, and it is proposed that the production consumption of building materials plays a key role in energy conservation and emission reduction. This paper concludes that the box-shaped column flange connection achieved by plug welding-core sleeve in the construction phase of an assembled steel building emits 49.5% less carbon dioxide than a conventional full fusion-welded joint. And the reason for the high carbon emissions of the latter is mainly from the amount of materials and machinery required for full penetration welding. It further affirms the green and environmental protection effect of the assembled steel structure plug welding-core sleeve flange connection joint in actual projects, and provides a reference for related research.</description>

      <title>Surface Facets Reconstruction in Copper&#8208;Based Materials for Enhanced Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202401530</link>
      <description>Zezhong Xie, Qiushi Wang, Hao Yang, Jin Feng, Jian Chen, Shuqin Song, Changgong Meng, Kun Wang, Bei Long, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396967884

                Abstract The unavoidable and unpredictable surface reconstruction of metallic copper (Cu) during the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reduction process is a double&#8208;edged sword affecting the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added hydrocarbon products. It is crucial to control the surface facet reconstruction and regulate the targeted facets/facet interfaces, and further understand the mechanism between activity/selectivity and the reconstructed structure of Cu for CO 2 reduction. Based on the current catalyst design methods, a facile strategy combining chemical reduction and electro&#8208;reduction is proposed to achieve specified Cu(111) facets and the Cu(110)/(111) interfaces in reconstructed Cu derived from cuprous oxide (Cu 2 O). The surface facet reconstruction significantly boosted the electrocatalytic conversion of CO 2 into multi&#8208;carbon (C 2+ ) products comparing to the unmodified catalyst. Theoretical and experimental analyses show that the Cu(110)/(111)s interface between Cu(110) and a small amount of Cu(111) can tailor the reaction routes and lower the reaction energy barrier of C&#8211;C coupling to ethylene (C 2 H 4 ). The work will guide the surface facets reconstruction strategy for Cu&#8208;based CO 2 electrocatalysts, providing a promising paradigm to understand the structural variation in catalysts.</description>

                The integration of artificial intelligence (AI)&#8211;machine learning (ML) in the field of electrochemistry is expected to reduce the burden of time and cost associated with experimental procedures. The application of AI&#8211;ML has pioneered a novel approach and has heralded a paradigm shift in catalyst development, optimization of operational conditions, prediction of battery lifespan, and the development of innovative descriptors. This review delves deep into these critical objectives, highlighting the intersection of AI&#8211;ML in the fields of water electrolysis, fuel cells, batteries, and carbon dioxide reduction. This review also underscores the potential of AI&#8211;ML to bridge theoretical computations with practical applications and to advance the electrochemical field.</description>

      <title>From carrot to stick &#8211; the impact of a changing landscape of CCS policy and funding in Australia since 1999</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23167</link>
      <description>Rebecca Johnstone, No host. 64(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396974706

                Since 1999 successive Australian Commonwealth governments have provided direct funding for carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) projects, notably the carbon capture and storage (CCS) Flagships Fund (Rudd government, 2009). The most recent CCUS Hubs and Technologies Fund (Morrison government, 2022) was later revoked (Albanese government, 2022) marking a shift from direct funding (&#8216;carrot&#8217;) to emission reduction through a strengthening of the Safeguard Mechanism, the introduction of a 43% emissions reduction target by 2030, and the establishment of the Net Zero Authority (&#8216;stick&#8217;). Reports such as the &#8216;Net Zero Mobilisation Report&#8217;, have delineated the need for, and size of, the role of CCUS in Australia, especially for hard-to-abate sectors and the report states &#8216;private investment in a CCUS industry requires targeted government support&#8217; i.e. funding. As government focus moves from direct funding support for CCS to CCU and direct air capture (DAC), the development of underground geological storage of carbon dioxide will be largely left to fossil fuel emitters, especially large liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies, reflected in current Western Australian government policy (Cook government, 2023) to develop CCS strategy as part of the LNG Jobs Taskforce. The only current exception is CarbonNet, operated by the Victorian government and one of the early CCS Flagship funded projects.</description>

      <title>ETE-SRSP: An Enhanced Optimization of Tramp Ship Routing and Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse12050817</link>
      <description>Xiaohu Huang, Yuhan Liu, Mei Sha, Bing Han, Dezhi Han, Han Liu, Journal of marine science and engineering. 12(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396929827

                In the contemporary tramp shipping industry, route optimization and scheduling are directly linked to enhancements in operations, economics, and the environment, making them key factors for the effective management of maritime transportation. To enhance effective ship-to-cargo matching and the refinement of maritime transportation itineraries, this paper introduces a time efficiency and carbon dioxide emission multi-objective optimization algorithm named ETE-SRSP (efficiency&#8211;time&#8211;emission multi-optimization algorithm). ETE-SRSP incorporates several factors, including the initial positions of ships, time windows for loading and unloading operations, and varying sailing speeds. Within the ETE-SRSP framework, pioneering an approach that integrates ballast and laden sailing velocities as decisional parameters, it employs a multi-objective optimization technique to investigate the intricate interplay between temporal efficiency and carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, the model&#8217;s proficiency in mitigating emissions and managing costs is clearly demonstrated through the optimization of these objectives, thereby offering a robust framework for decision support. The experimental results show that the optimal sailing speeds derived from the ETE-SRSP, under typical time-weight scenarios, can achieve an optimal balance between emission reduction and cost control. In summary, this study underscores the optimization strategy&#8217;s potential to effectively address the maritime sector&#8217;s need for economic growth and ecological conservation, showcasing its practical value in the industry.</description>

                Abstract As a result of electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), value-added chemicals like as synthetic fuels and chemical feedstocks can be produced. In the current state of the art, copper-based materials are most widely used being the most effective catalysts for this reaction. It is still necessary to improve the reaction rate and product selectivity of CuOx for electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). The main objective of this work was synthesized and evaluate the copper oxide electrocatalyst combined with silver (CuO 70% Ag 30%) for the conversion of carbon dioxide into synthetic fuels. The catalysts have been prepared by the oxalate method and assessed in a flow cell system. The results of electrochemical experiments were carried out at room temperature and at different potentials (-1.05 V&#8211;0.75 V vs. RHE in presence of 0.1 M KHCO 3 ) and gas and liquid chromatographic analysis are summarized. The CuOx-based electrodes demonstrated the selective of ~ 25% at -0.55 V for formic acid (HCOOH) and over CuO -Ag and selective of ethylene at ~ 20% over CuOx at -1.05 V. Other products were formed as ethylene, ethanol, and propanol (C 2 H 4 , EtOH, PrOH) at more positive potentials. On the other hand, carbon monoxide, acetate, ethylene glycol, propinaldehyde, glycoaldehyde and glyoxal (CO, CH 3 COO, C 2 H 6 O 2 , C 3 H 6 O, C 2 H 4 O 2 , C 2 H 2 O 2 ) have been formed and detected. Based on the results of these studies, it appears that the formation of synthetic fuels from CO 2 at room temperature in alkaline environment can be very promising.</description>

      <title>Indigo as a Low&#8208;Cost Redox&#8208;Active Sorbent for Electrochemically Mediated Carbon Capture</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202402355</link>
      <description>Krish N. Jayarapu, Anmol Mathur, Xing Li, Andong Liu, Lingyu Zhang, Jaeeun Kim, Hyun-Ah Kim, Su Keun Kuk, Yayuan Liu, Advanced functional materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396857371

                Abstract Climate change has driven the need for carbon capture to mitigate anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, yet current thermochemical methods are hampered by high energy intensities. Electrochemically mediated carbon capture (EMCC) utilizing redox&#8208;active carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) carriers is an attractive alternative for carbon capture. Here, an economical vat dye compound, indigo, is presented, which can reversibly capture and release CO 2 upon electrochemical reduction and oxidation, respectively. Electrode and electrolyte engineering strategies are utilized to improve the reversibility and stability of indigo for EMCC. A bench&#8208;scale prototypical fixed&#8208;bed carbon capture device is constructed to demonstrate indigo's EMCC performance under various practically relevant conditions, such as simulated flue gas and extremely dilute sources pertinent to direct air capture. A hybrid sorbent electrode&#8208;gas diffusion layer approach is revealed to alleviate CO 2 mass transport limitations, achieving &#8776;80% CO 2 capacity utilization under a 15% CO 2 feed stream. Furthermore, a reactive&#8208;diffusive mass transport model is developed to illustrate engineering approaches that can be universally applied to optimize fixed&#8208;bed EMCC systems. This work advances the potential for a class of low&#8208;cost sorbents for EMCC while underscoring the importance of molecular, electrolyte, materials, and device engineering strategies to enable high&#8208;performance carbon capture.</description>

      <title>Precise Modulation and Densification of Metal Sites in Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Energy Storage and Conversion</title>

      <description>Xiaoqing Liu, Wei Peng, Haotian Tan, Zhiyuan Sang, Ji Liang, Advanced energy materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396883648

                Abstract Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance in various catalytic reactions. However, the low metal loading (&lt;1.0 wt.%) and the difficulty in precisely modulating their coordination configurations hinder the practical yield of target products and the understanding of actual reaction mechanisms. To overcome these obstacles, a series of strategies are proposed to design SACs with a precise coordination configuration and/or a high density of active sites. For an insightful and comprehensive understanding of these strategies, it is worth analyzing and categorizing them according to their intrinsic mechanisms and applicational perspectives. In this review, the synthesis strategies of precise and/or high&#8208;density SACs are first summarized. Moreover, taking typical electrochemical processes, including oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction, metal&#8211;sulfur batteries, etc., as examples, the applications of these SACs are discussed, focusing on their advantages in enhancing the yield of target products, improving the efficiency of energy storage, and revealing the unique effects. Finally, the challenges and perspective of precise modulation and densification of metal sites for SACs are proposed. It is expected that this review can provide a useful reference for the design and preparation of high&#8208;density and/or controllably coordinated SACs.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and challenges to improve carbon and greenhouse gas budgets of the forest industry through better management of pulp and paper by-products</title>

                Developing land use strategies to optimize carbon sinks and improve carbon footprints involves proposing efficient nature-based solutions that industries and businesses can implement while considering financial and legislative constraints. The pulp and paper industry is associated with significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily due to the substantial carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) footprint of its mills. Also, some forestry operations contribute to the release of carbon to the atmosphere in the form of CO 2 and methane (CH 4 ). Conversely, this industry could potentially be a significant ally in the fight against climate change by favoring forestry practices that reduce carbon emissions and increase its sequestration, namely, by adding value to industrial by-products (e.g., biosolids) instead of treating them as wastes and landfilling them. Notably, the pulp and paper industry has been seeking alternative uses of its by-products, such as fertilizers to maximize tree growth. In this paper, we identify opportunities and challenges that exist for the pulp and paper industry in regard to recycling industrial by-products to: 1) lower GHG emissions directly at the mill and 2) improve its GHG budget by increasing carbon sequestration in forests and plantations. We illustrate our analyses by describing a case study of a pulp and paper mill in southern Quebec, Canada, that uses its biosolids and other by-products as fertilizers. This case study highlights that this strategy could not only contribute to the reduction of GHGs but could also create added value and improve economic returns of forest operations.</description>

      <title>Electrification of distillation for decarbonization: An overview and perspective</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2024.114522</link>
      <description>Chong Cui, Meng Qi, Xiaodong Zhang, Jinsheng Sun, Qing Li, Anton A. Kiss, David Shan Hill Wong, Cornelius Mduduzi Masuku, Moonyong Lee, Renewable &amp; sustainable energy reviews. 199(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396881088

                Distillation remains the leading and most frequently adopted technique for the separation and purification of condensable mixtures in numerous industries. However, the inherently poor thermal efficiency of distillation requires a large amount of thermal energy, making it the chief factor in total process energy usage and a significant emitter of carbon dioxide due to the combustion of fossil fuels. To address this issue, electrification has arisen as a popular approach to reduce carbon emissions in different processes by primarily replacing the energy source with electricity derived from renewable energy resources. This review is designed to thoroughly explore the electrification concept in decarbonizing distillation and present a detailed analysis and summary of the cutting-edge technologies used in various distillation operations. The focus is on creating electrified distillation processes and their associated utility systems, making use of a range of power-to-heat and intensification strategies, to achieve simultaneous carbon reduction and energy savings. With the increasing variety of operating environments that incorporate renewable power, this review additionally encompasses the control and operation aspects to ensure efficient management of electrified distillation processes. To further delve into the advantages of incorporating electrification into distillation, this work proposes future directions from the viewpoints of technological advancement, design optimization, operation, and real-time scheduling of electrified distillation processes. Furthermore, this review highlights the enormous potential of electrification in dramatically lowering carbon emissions and promoting sustainable practices in the distillation industry.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Evolution Trend of China&#8217;s Digital Carbon Footprint: A Simulation Based on System Dynamics Approach</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16104230</link>
      <description>Ruiheng Xu, Kaiwen Ji, Zichen Yuan, Cheng Wang, Yihan Xia, Sustainability. 16(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4397002348

                The rapid growth of the digital economy has heightened concerns over its environmental impacts, particularly in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. In contrast to previous studies that focus on the positive effects of digital technology on reducing carbon emissions, this paper provides a detailed analysis of the various factors that influence digital economy carbon emissions and their interrelationships, using the system dynamics method to simulate and predict China&#8217;s future digital economy carbon emission baseline from 2016 to 2046. Four different scenarios were established by adjusting parameters for the percentage of the digital economy, e-waste growth rate, and data center power consumption. The simulation results indicate the following: (1) The baseline scenario shows China&#8217;s digital economy carbon emissions peaking at 1.9045 billion tons in 2041 after an initial increase and subsequent decrease. (2) Single-policy simulations indicate that changing the digital economy&#8217;s scale and e-waste growth independently leads to peak emissions of 1.9205 billion tons and 1.5525 billion tons, respectively. Adjusting data center power consumption has a greater impact, increasing the peak emissions to 2.1675 billion tons, a 13.82% rise from the baseline. (3) Under the comprehensive regulation scenario, emissions peak in 2040 at 2.0813 billion tons, considering the interactions between the digital economy, data center power, and e-waste. Based on the findings, we recommend fostering innovation in the digital industry, enhancing the e-waste treatment process, strategically developing digital infrastructure, and exploring effective carbon reduction strategies for the digital economy aimed at supporting China in achieving its dual-carbon goals.</description>

      <title>Monitor and reduce emissions to meet compliance and sustainability goals</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/ep23218</link>
      <description>Nicolas Castelijns, No host. 64(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396975294

                In today&#8217;s climate-conscious world, companies across the globe continue to push to optimise energy use and reduce or eliminate their greenhouse gas emissions. Investments aimed at emission monitoring and reduction are driven by the need to optimise consumption of electricity, gas, oil, and water to meet emissions reduction targets and sustainability goals. Tracking and reducing emissions can improve process uptime through predictive maintenance and reduce product losses across the process. Methane emissions are in particular focus as methane is more than 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stated that a third of methane emissions in North America come from the industrial sector, and similar figures come from the European Commission. It is no wonder that government and industry are laser-focussed on improving their approach to the reduction of methane emissions. As companies drive their own corporate standards to achieve net zero emissions, there is also a need to comply with existing and upcoming governmental emissions standards and regulations, and report emissions on a periodic basis. The trend to move fugitive emissions monitoring from periodic to continuous provides operators with a greater insight into emissions sources which drives efficiencies through the reduction of lost product and a more predictive approach to maintenance. Investors are increasingly focussed on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting and favouring companies that can demonstrate strong ESG performance. Fugitive emission leaks can translate into billions of dollars of lost productivity annually, and serious occupational accidents.</description>

      <title>Second Coordination Sphere Effects in an Earth-Abundant Monometallic Complex as Catalyst Dictate Highly Selective Photochemical Conversion of CO2 to HCOOH</title>

                Photochemical reduction of CO2 to formic acid (HCOOH) using molecular transition metal complexes as catalysts has been previously documented to proceed via either of the two mechanisms: CO2 insertion into metal hydride bonds, or hydrogenation of CO2. We present herein photoreduction of CO2 to HCOOH that adopts both these pathways by a single monometallic molecular catalyst featuring earth-abundant cobalt - a characteristic not observed in other molecular catalysts for CO2 photoreduction to date. This dual functionality stems from distinctly different, active forms of the catalyst, at different temporal stages of irradiation. We employ in situ NMR spectroscopy to monitor potential catalytic intermediates at various time points of irradiation by visible light. These observed states align with the kinetic profiles of product evolution, proving instrumental in revealing the catalyst's unique behavior. We advocate for the integration of such in situ NMR monitoring in future studies as it provides a valuable tool for an informed design of photochemical CO2 reduction by molecular catalysts.</description>

                Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are the primary drivers of global climate change. Human activities, particularly those related to energy production, transportation, and industry, have long contributed to the escalating levels of GHGs in the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Recognizing the significance of this issue, universities, including Thammasat University, play a vital role in Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions research and education, carrying a responsibility to address the matter. This study is aimed aims to assess the greenhouse gas emissions and mitigation measures at Thammasat University (Lampang campus), Thailand. The emissions are categorized into 3 types: (1) direct GHG emissions; (2) energy-related indirect GHG emissions; and (3) other indirect GHG emissions. Activity data from the years 2019 to 2022 was used for the calculations, resulting in GHG emissions of 1051.70, 778.28, 558.64, and 1034.531 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. Among these emissions, energy-related indirect GHG emissions from electricity purchases represent the majority, accounting for approximately 78.55% of the total emissions. Consequently, implementing mitigation strategies, such as solar panel installations and solid waste reduction (combined scenario), has the potential to reduce GHG emissions by up to 57.78%. Furthermore, the university should actively promote GHG emissions reduction through the enactment of energy-saving policies and the adoption of energy-efficient technologies to reduce reliance on energy purchases.</description>

                Abstract Modelling of the co-electrolysis process requires understanding of the underlying reaction pathways under H2/H2O/CO/CO2-atmospheres. These include the electrochemical steam reduction/hydrogen oxidation, the electrochemical CO2 reduction/CO oxidation and their coupling via the catalytic (reverse) water gas shift reaction ((R)WGS). The assumption of a very fast RWGS and therefore neglectable electrochemical CO2 conversion is commonly used to model the co-electrolysis process. In contrast, previous studies on Ni/GDC fuel electrodes suggest that the electrochemical conversion of CO / CO2 can be present in H2/H2O/CO/CO2-atmospheres. To deconvolute surface-related and non-surface-related processes in the impedance response we present results from a complex variation of operating parameters for process identification by the use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and the subsequent impedance analysis by the distribution of relaxation times. A physically meaningful equivalent circuit model, based on a single channel transmission line, is then derived. The model enables quantification of the surface reaction resistance under varied C/H-ratios. From a kinetic analysis it is shown that the electrochemical H2/H2O conversion is dominant for y_CO+y_(CO_2 )&#8804; 50% and electrochemical CO/CO2-conversion onsets from y_CO+y_(CO_2 )&#8805; 60%.</description>

                Continuing a comprehensive study of the reduction of COx over supported Ru catalysts, we explored the interaction of CO2 with Ru/g-Al2O3 by TAP reactor measurements, focusing on dynamic aspects in adsorption/desorption, reaction and oxygen exchange processes. Pulse shape analysis in H2/CO2 multipulse sequences provides information on the interaction of reactant/product species with the catalyst. The measurements provide information on the dynamic build-up of reaction intermediates and more stable adspecies during pulsing, and its relation to CH4 formation. Facile oxygen exchange between CO2 and catalyst, followed by isotope labelling experiments, is quantitatively reconciled in a simple model, relating the ratio between different CO2 isotopologues to the 18O : 16O ratio in the total exchangeable oxygen on the surface and in the CO2 pulse. The results provide detailed insight into various aspects of the interaction between CO2 and Ru/Al2O3 catalysts important for a mechanistic understanding of various catalytic reactions involving CO2.</description>

                In an exploration of environmental concerns, this groundbreaking research delves into the relationship between GDP per capita, coal rents, forest rents, mineral rents, oil rents, natural gas rents, fossil fuels, renewables, environmental tax and environment-related technologies on CO2 emissions in 30 highly emitting countries from 1995 to 2021 using instrumental-variables regression Two-Stage least squares (IV-2SLS) regression and two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimates. Our results indicate a significant positive relationship between economic growth and CO2 emissions across all quantiles, showcasing an EKC with diminishing marginal effects. Coal rents exhibit a statistically significant negative relationship with emissions, particularly in higher quantiles, and mineral rents show a negative association with CO2 emissions in lower and middle quantiles, reinforcing the idea of resource management in emissions reduction. Fossil fuels exert a considerable adverse impact on emissions, with a rising effect in progressive quantiles. Conversely, renewable energy significantly curtails CO2 emissions, with higher impacts in lower quantiles. Environmental tax also mitigates CO2 emissions. Environment-related technologies play a pivotal role in emission reduction, particularly in lower and middle quantiles, emphasizing the need for innovative solutions. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, highlighting the importance of tailoring interventions to different emission levels and leveraging diverse strategies for sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Tandem atomically dispersed metal catalysts to promote flow-line electrocatalytic CO2RR</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2024.215955</link>
      <description>Shoufu Cao, Zhaojie Wang, Shuxian Wei, Siyuan Liu, Xiaoqing Lu, Coordination chemistry reviews. 514(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396881448

                Atomically dispersed metal catalysts (ADMCs), featuring attractive electronic/geometric configuration and excellent catalytic performance, have emerged a novel class of heterogenous catalysts. However, the linear limitations of ADMCs for complex catalytic reactions, such as the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (ECO2RR) for C2+ products, constrain the further improvement of the catalytic performance. Hence, we proposed a tandem ADMCs (T-ADMCs) model for the first time, which is inspired by the tandem catalysis observed in the multienzyme catalytic cycles of biocatalytic systems. The coupled multistep reactions occurring at the adjacent sites in T-ADMCs may promote flow-line ECO2RR and optimize the overall catalytic performance. This perspective overviews the recent research advances on T-ADMCs for ECO2RR and highlights the advancing orientation of T-ADMCs. Reaction mechanisms based on CO, formic acid, and acetaldehyde intermediates on T-ADMCs are proposed. The activity-promoting effects of tandem catalyst are elucidated, including the regulation of electronic structure via long-range interaction, breaking of linear scaling relationship, and modulation of local microenvironment through intralayer or interlayer diffusion. The challenges, opportunities, and further development of T-ADMCs and reaction mechanisms under realistic electrocatalytic environment are proposed. This work sheds new light on the design of high-performance T-ADMCs.</description>

      <title>Mesomorphology of clathrate hydrates from molecular ordering</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0200516</link>
      <description>Carlos L. Bassani, Michael Engel, Amadeu K. Sum, Journal of chemical physics online/&#152;The &#156;Journal of chemical physics/Journal of chemical physics. 160(19)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4398132031

                Clathrate hydrates are crystals formed by guest molecules that stabilize cages of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Whereas thermodynamic equilibrium is well described via the van der Waals and Platteeuw approach, the increasing concerns with global warming and energy transition require extending the knowledge to non-equilibrium conditions in multiphase, sheared systems, in a multiscale framework. Potential macro-applications concern the storage of carbon dioxide in the form of clathrates, and the reduction of hydrate inhibition additives currently required in hydrocarbon production. We evidence porous mesomorphologies as key to bridging the molecular scales to macro-applications of low solubility guests. We discuss the coupling of molecular ordering with the mesoscales, including (i) the emergence of porous patterns as a combined factor from the walk over the free energy landscape and 3D competitive nucleation and growth and (ii) the role of molecular attachment rates in crystallization&#8211;diffusion models that allow predicting the timescale of pore sealing. This is a perspective study that discusses the use of discrete models (molecular dynamics) to build continuum models (phase field models, crystallization laws, and transport phenomena) to predict multiscale manifestations at a feasible computational cost. Several advances in correlated fields (ice, polymers, alloys, and nanoparticles) are discussed in the scenario of clathrate hydrates, as well as the challenges and necessary developments to push the field forward.</description>

      <title>MULTI-OBJECTIVE GREEN DESIGN MODEL BASED ON COSTS, CO2 EMISSIONS AND SERVICEABILITY FOR HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS WITH A MEGA-STRUCTURE SYSTEM</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3846/jcem.2024.21357</link>
      <description>Jewoo Choi, Seung Hyeong Lee, Taehoon Hong, Dong&#8208;Eun Lee, Hyo Seon Park, Journal of civil engineering and management. 30(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4397010538

                In light of growing environmental concerns, the reduction of CO2 emissions is increasingly vital. Particularly in the construction industry, a major contributor to global carbon emissions, addressing this issue is critical for environmental sustainability and mitigating the accelerating impacts of climate change. This study proposes the Optimal Green Design Model for Mega Structures (OGDMM) to optimise CO2 emissions, cost-effectiveness, and serviceability in highrise buildings with mega structures. The OGDMM examines the impact of each material and structural design of main members on these three critical aspects. Analytical results for high-rise buildings (120&#8211;200 m, slenderness ratio: 2.0&#8211;8.0) demonstrate that OGDMM can reduce CO2 emissions and costs by an average of 4.67% and 3.97%, respectively, without compromising serviceability. To ensure comprehensive evaluation, this study introduces five new evaluation indicators encompassing environmental, economic, and serviceability performances of high-rise buildings. Based on these criteria, optimised structural designs for high-rise buildings are classified into four categories according to slenderness ratio, leading to the formulation of corresponding design guidelines. The model&#8217;s applicability is further validated through its application to a 270-m-tall high-rise building in Korea, showing reductions in CO2 emissions and costs by 8.99% and 18.50%, respectively, while maintaining structural serviceability.</description>

      <title>Climate-dependency of Impact of Increased Carbon Dioxide on African Monsoon Rainfall: Insights from model simulations</title>

                Previous studies on future scenarios identified two key effects of increasing CO2 on the African summer monsoon (ASM): Rising CO2 leads to an enhancement in moisture supply, favoring an increase in ASM precipitation (the thermodynamic effect). However, it also results in a weakening in mean atmospheric flow, thus facilitating a dryness across the ASM region (the dynamic effect). Therefore, the ultimate change in ASM precipitation stems from the balance of both the thermodynamic and dynamic effects. This study further examines the impact of rising CO2 on ASM rainfall, by taking into account various climate states. Our results suggest that an increase in CO2 during warm interglacial periods has a stronger influence from thermodynamic factors than from dynamic factors, resulting in an enhancement in ASM rainfall. In contrast, if CO2 increases under cold glacial climate backgrounds, its dynamic impact dominates a reduction of rainfall in the ASM region.</description>

      <title>IMPACT OF SHADING DEVICES ON COOLING LOAD IN EDUCATIONAL BUILDINGS</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3992/jgb.19.2.223</link>
      <description>Sofiane Rahmouni, Antar Si Mohammed, Journal of green building. 19(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396933488

                ABSTRACT This paper examines the influence of shading devices in non-residential buildings on enhancing cooling loads, mitigating environmental impact, and reducing energy consumption in semi-arid climates. The focus is on educational buildings as part of Algeria's national strategy to enhance sustainability and decrease energy usage. To achieve this, a comparative analysis was conducted, encompassing both numerical and experimental assessments of the effects of four indoor shading techniques and three outdoor shading techniques. Subsequently, the impact of the optimal shading combination on four main orientations was evaluated using dynamic building simulation software. The outcomes demonstrate that the optimal combination of shading devices substantially affects cooling loads, leading to noteworthy energy savings and a reduction in CO2 emissions. Notably, these savings can reach up to 7% in cooling load reduction and up to 32% in energy and CO2 emission reductions. Furthermore, the study concludes that distinct design considerations should be tailored to climate attributes and building orientations to achieve maximal cooling load reductions. This research enriches the existing knowledge concerning the optimization of shading devices for educational buildings with a focus on cooling load reduction. The findings emphasize the necessity for architects, builders, and proprietors to incorporate passive design alternatives that align optimally with energy efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and overall building sustainability.</description>

                Growing trend of air pollution has become one of the familiar environmental hazards for the society. It is a mixture of toxic compounds emerging from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Depending on the source and rate of emission the components of air pollution change dramatically. The primary human-made sources of air pollution may include vehicle emissions, natural gas to heat homes, fuel oils, and by-products of manufacturing and power generation and fumes from chemical production. In addition to that, various hazardous substances such as methane and other gases are released by decomposing organic matter in soils, and other gases include ash and smoke from volcanic eruptions, which are frequently caused by humans. Various reports around the world have consistently demonstrated that air pollution is a significant adaptable risk factor for enhanced mortality. Air pollutants can harm the health of humans, animals, plants, and buildings. The pollutants are in the form of gases, solid particles, or liquid droplets. Ozone (O3), nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2) are some of the gaseous pollutants that contribute to air pollution. The pollution is now the leading environmental cause of premature death. Cardiovascular events such as acute ischemic account for the majority of the additional mortality caused by air pollution. Aside from increased mortality, air contamination is linked to significant reductions in worker productivity. Exposure to air pollution has a wide range of negative consequences on people's health. The effects of air pollution can be divided into short-term and long-term effects. The discomfort, such as irritation to the nose, eyes, throat or skin, as well as infections like bronchitis are short-term symptoms that are transient. It can also cause headaches, nausea and dizziness. The long-term effects of pollution can last for years and cause various respiratory diseases. Long-term damage to people's nerves, brains, kidneys, liver, and other organs, birth defects are the consequences of air pollution (Brook et al. 2004; Newby et al. 2015; Zivin and Neidell 2018; Hamanaka and Mutlu 2018).</description>

                A Cu/Co tandem catalysis protocol was developed to conduct the hydroformylation of olefins using CO2/H2 and PMHS (polymethylhydrosiloxane) as a readily available and environmentally friendly hydride source. This methodology was performed via a two-step approach consisting of the copper-catalyzed reduction of CO2 by hydrosilane and subsequent cobalt-promoted hydroformylation with H2 and the in situ formed CO. The optimized triphos oxide ligand, which presumably facilitates the migratory insertion of CO gives moderate to excellent yields for both terminal and internal alkenes. This earth-abundant metal catalysis provides a reliable and efficient way to afford useful aldehydes in industry using silicon by-product PMHS as hydrogen source and renewable CO2 as carbonyl source.</description>

      <title>Extracting critical paths for synergistic control of carbon emissions and air pollution: Case of Henan Province</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2024.05.011</link>
      <description>Ningwei Wang, Shanshan Wang, Y. Li, Yingying Zhao, Tiantian Chun, Ruiqin Zhang, Journal of Environmental Sciences/Journal of environmental sciences. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396893168

                Synergistic reduction of carbon emissions and air pollution is the core means to address the two major strategic tasks of fundamentally improving the ecological environment and the 'Dual-carbon target'. The issue of synergistic reduction at the provincial level needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. Taking Henan Province, the largest economy in central China, as an example, this study uses environmentally extended input-output analysis and structural path analysis to identify the key sectors that contribute to CO2, SO2, and total particulate matter (TPM) emissions, and to sort out key emission pathways (e.g., Final Demand &#8594; Sector&#8230;). The results indicate that S2 (Mining of Fossil Energy), S10 (Nonmetal Mineral Products), S11 (Metal Smelting), S13 (Power and Heat) and S17 (Transportation) are mainly responsible for CO2, SO2, and TPM direct emissions on the production side, while S16 (Construction), S12 (Equipment) and S18 (Services) account for more than 45 % of CO2, SO2, and TPM embodied emissions on the consumption side. 32 shared emission pathways are extracted from the top 100 pathways for CO2, SO2, and TPM emissions, which account for 27 %-51 % of total emissions in Henan Province. P9 (Export &#8594; Nonmetal Mineral Products), P10 (Export &#8594; Metal Smelting) and P21 (Gross Capital Formation &#8594; Construction &#8594; Nonmetal Mineral Products) are the leading paths responsible for embodied emissions. The research results provide the foundation and guidance for well-designed mitigation policies, as well as a reference for better synergistic control in provinces facing similar situations.</description>

                Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) can efficiently utilize renewable energy to achieve efficient CO2 reduction and CH4 reforming for syngas production. In this work, a high-performance quasi-symmetric Ni-based electrolyzer with Ni&#8211;Gd0.1Ce0.9O2 (GDC) porous cathode and Ni&#8211;Y0.16Zr0.84O1.92 (YSZ) microchannel anode, is designed for efficient CO2 electrolysis and electrochemical oxidation of CH4. The electrolytic current density of SOEC reaches 3.2 A cm&#8722;2 at the voltage of 1.5 V for CH4-assisted CO2 electrolysis. Highly efficient and stable electrolysis of CO2 is achieved at the thin porous Ni-GDC cathode without external protective gases through the regulation of methane concentration and increasing the electrolysis current. The designed SOECs exhibits a stable operation for 400 h at a highly electrolysis current density of 2 A cm&#8722;2 without external protective gases and does not experience detrimental effects from the carbon deposits, despite the presence of a small amount of carbon deposits observed in the anode channels confirmed by the EDS analysis. This study has demonstrated that the design of quasi-symmetric Ni-ceramic electrolyzer is a highly efficient strategy for achieving electrochemical reforming of CH4 with CO2.</description>

      <title>An integrated technology for the absorption and utilization of CO2 in alkanolamine solution for the preparation of BaCO3 in a high gravity environment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cjche.2024.04.012</link>
      <description>Kaiyu Nie, Ruize Shang, Fuming Miao, Liuxiang Wang, Youzhi Liu, Weizhou Jiao, Chinese journal of chemical engineering/Chinese Journal of Chemical Engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396906674

                In this study, an integrated technology is proposed for the absorption and utilization of CO2 in alkanolamine solution for the preparation of BaCO3 in a high gravity environment. The effects of absorbent type, high gravity factor, gas/liquid ratio, and initial BaCl2 concentration on the absorption rate and amount of CO2 and the preparation of BaCO3 are investigated. The results reveal that the absorption rate and amount of CO2 follow the order of ethyl alkanolamine (MEA) &gt; diethanol amine (DEA) &gt; N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), and thus MEA is the most effective absorbent for CO2 absorption. The absorption rate and amount of CO2 under high gravity are higher than that under normal gravity. Notably, the absorption rate at 75 min under high gravity is approximately 2 times that under normal gravity. This is because the centrifugal force resulting from the high-speed rotation of the packing can greatly increase gas-liquid mass transfer and micromixing. The particle size of BaCO3 prepared in the rotating packed bed is in the range of 57.2&#8722;89 nm, which is much smaller than that prepared in the bubbling reactor (&gt;100.3 nm), and it also has higher purity (99.6 %) and larger specific surface area (14.119 m2/g). It is concluded that the high gravity technology has the potential to increase the absorption and utilization of CO2 in alkanolamine solution for the preparation of BaCO3. This study provides new insights into carbon emissions reduction and carbon utilization.</description>

      <title>Opinion: A research roadmap for exploring atmospheric methane removal via iron salt aerosol</title>

                Abstract. The escalating climate crisis requires rapid action to reduce the concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases and lower global surface temperatures. Methane will play a critical role in near-term warming due to its high radiative forcing and short atmospheric lifetime. Methane emissions have accelerated in recent years, and there is significant risk and uncertainty associated with the future growth in natural emissions. The largest natural sink of methane occurs through oxidation reactions with atmospheric hydroxyl and chlorine radicals. Enhanced atmospheric oxidation could be a potential approach to remove atmospheric methane. One method proposes the addition of iron salt aerosol (ISA) to the atmosphere, mimicking a natural process proposed to occur when mineral dust mixes with chloride from sea spray to form iron chlorides, which are photolyzed by sunlight to produce chlorine radicals. Under the right conditions, lofting ISA into the atmosphere could potentially reduce atmospheric methane concentrations and lower global surface temperatures. Recognizing that potential atmospheric methane removal must only be considered an additive measure &#8211; in addition to, not replacing, crucial anthropogenic greenhouse gas emission reductions and carbon dioxide removal &#8211; roadmaps can be a valuable tool to organize and streamline interdisciplinary and multifaceted research to efficiently move towards understanding whether an approach may be viable and socially acceptable or if it is nonviable and further research should be deprioritized. Here we present a 5-year research roadmap to explore whether ISA enhancement of the chlorine radical sink could be a viable and socially acceptable atmospheric methane removal approach.</description>

      <title>Insights into Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction on Metallic and Oxidized Tin Using Grand-Canonical DFT and In Situ ATR-SEIRA Spectroscopy</title>

                Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) to formate is an attractive carbon emissions mitigation strategy due to the existing market and attractive price for formic acid. Tin is an effective electrocatalyst for CO2R to formate, but the underlying reaction mechanism and whether the active phase of tin is metallic or oxidized during reduction is openly debated. In this report, we used grand-canonical density functional theory and attenuated total reflection surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy to identify differences in the vibrational signatures of surface species during CO2R on fully metallic and oxidized tin surfaces. Our results show that CO2R is feasible on both metallic and oxidized tin. We propose that the key difference between each surface termination is that CO2R catalyzed by metallic tin surfaces is limited by the electrochemical activation of CO2, whereas CO2R catalyzed by oxidized tin surfaces is limited by the slow reductive desorption of formate. While the exact degree of oxidation of tin surfaces during CO2R is unlikely to be either fully metallic or fully oxidized, this study highlights the limiting behavior of these two surfaces and lays out the key features of each that our results predict will promote rapid CO2R catalysis. Additionally, we highlight the power of integrating high-fidelity quantum mechanical modeling and spectroscopic measurements to elucidate intricate electrocatalytic reaction pathways.</description>

      <title>Wastewater-grown microalgae biomass as a source of sustainable aviation fuel: Life cycle assessment comparing hydrothermal routes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121164</link>
      <description>Bianca Barros Marangon, Jackeline de Siqueira Castro, Paula Peixoto Assemany, N&#237;talo Andr&#233; Farias Machado, Maria L&#250;cia Calijuri, Journal of environmental management. 360(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4397289846

                The present paper compared, through life cycle assessment (LCA), the production of aviation biofuel from two hydrothermal routes of microalgae cultivated in wastewater. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) and gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (G + FT) were compared. Both routes included biomass production, hydrotreatment for biofuel upgrading, and product fractionation. Secondary data obtained from the literature were used for the cradle-to-gate LCA. G + FT had a higher impact than HTL in the 18 impact categories assessed, with human carcinogenic toxicity exerting the most harmful pressure on the environment. The catalysts were the inputs that caused the most adverse emissions. The solvent used for bio-oil separation also stood out in terms of impacts. In HTL, emissions for global warming were &#8722;51.6 g CO2 eq/MJ, while in G + FT, they were 250 g CO2 eq/MJ. At the Endpoint level, HTL resulted in benefits to human health and ecosystems, while G + FT caused environmental damage in these two categories, as well as in the resources category. In the improvement scenarios, besides considering solid, aqueous, and gaseous products as co-products rather than just as waste/emissions, a 20% reduction in catalyst consumption and 90% recovery were applied. Thus, in HTL, 39.47 kg CO2 eq was avoided, compared to 35.44 kg CO2 eq in the base scenario. In G + FT, emissions decreased from 147.55 kg CO2 eq to the capture of 8.60 kg CO2 eq.</description>

                Here, we report an efficient integrated CO2 photoreduction to methanol accompanied with the simultaneous oxidation of benzyl amines to corresponding imines using quadrangular WO3 nanoplates grafted with Cu(BTC) as a photocatalyst under visible light, enabling to provide efficient use of the photogenerated electrons and holes. Under the optimized reaction conditions, the maximum yield of methanol and N-(4-methoxybenzyl)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)methanimine was found to be 642 &#956;mol-g &#8722; 1 and 98 %, respectively. The developed integrated dual functional system comprising CO2 reduction coupled with the oxidative organic synthesis opens a new window for value chain up gradation at both ends using sustainable solar energy.</description>

                This research paper aims to optimize electrical system modeling to minimize CO2 emissions, improve reliability, and reduce costs. It proposes integrating Elman Neural Network (ENN) and metaheuristic algorithm to evaluate environmental impact and optimize system performance. The goal is to create a mathematical model considering renewable energy sources, grid energy, CO2 emissions, and maintenance costs, and use metaheuristic algorithms to determine the optimal combination of wind turbines and photovoltaic panels. To train the ENN model and optimize the system, a three-stage approach is proposed. Quasi-random numbers are generated using Sobol techniques to create input data, which is then processed by TRNSYS for simulation. The proposed approach incorporates an ENN with Boosted version of the Coyote optimization algorithm to accurately model and predict the behavior of Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems for Zero Energy Buildings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our method significantly reduces energy consumption, costs, and system reliability, achieving a 25% reduction in energy consumption and 12% reduction in system cost, and is effective in optimizing hybrid solar/wind and hydrogen storage systems. The optimal system configuration significantly reduces CO2 emissions, achieves a high level of system reliability, and minimizes costs. Comparative analysis with previous studies showcases the superiority of the proposed method in achieving comprehensive optimization. In conclusion, this study combines AI techniques and metaheuristic algorithms to optimize electrical system design, considering environmental, technical, and economic factors. The proposed approach overcomes limitations in previous studies and offers an effective solution to address the optimization problem.</description>

                Here, a Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst by integration of copper phthalocyanine with carboxyl grafting (CuTcPc) and BiVO4 nanosheets (BVO) via the hydroxyl induced assembly strategy has been developed for selective CO2 photoreduction. The optimal CuTcPc/BVO catalyst delivers a 21-fold increments in CO yields compared with pristine BVO and 91 % selectivity towards CO2 reduction, coupled with nearly stoichiometric O2 in pure water. As unraveled by experimental results and theoretical simulations, the remarkably improved photoactivity is attributed to the complementary light absorption of BVO and CuTcPc, the enhanced charge transfer and separation due to the formation of Z-scheme heterojunction and most importantly the preferable CO2 adsorption and activation brought by the adjusted local coordination and electronic environment of central Cu-N4 sites by electron-withdrawing substituents. This study provides a feasible avenue to manipulate the active sites from the perspective of functional substitute tailoring on metal phthalocyanine over novel BiVO4-based Z-scheme heterojunctions for artificial photosynthesis.</description>

                Considering the alarming frequency of coal mine gas disasters globally, there is an urgent need to develop efficient gas control technologies to ensure mining safety. This study focuses on the problem of high peak gas emission restriction in the process of coal roadway tunneling in outburst coal seams, taking the No. 15 outburst coal seam of the Pingshu Coal Mine as the research object. Based on coal sample testing analysis and the application of CO2 gas fracturing (CO2-Frac) in coal mines, a comprehensive evaluation was conducted on pore-fracture structure alteration and homogenization gas emission effect induced by CO2-Frac, providing technical solutions for coal mine safety production. The results are as follows: (1) CO2-Frac induces fracture propagation and the development of three types of fracture structures: Tri-Wing Fracture, Damage Markers, and Coal Matrix Fragmentation. (2) Following CO2-Frac at 150 MPa, the pore volume and average diameter of pores in the 100&#8211;10,000 nm range increased by 128% and 61%, respectively, compared to the pre-CO2-Frac state. (3) During the excavation period, continuous monitoring of the airflow for 3 days showed a significant homogenization of gas emission, with a maximum value of 0.450% and a variance value of 0.0031, indicating a reduction of 31% and 68%, respectively. These results reveal several key findings: The pore-fracture structure alteration enhances gas diffusion and permeation, providing high-speed pathways for gas migration, resulting in a substantial increase in gas extraction efficiency. During coal cutting, the modified coal exhibits homogenized gas emission, eliminating the high peak phenomenon and achieving safe and efficient mining. These findings demonstrate that CO2-Frac has broad potential in gas emission homogenization for widespread application in coal mines with similar gas geological conditions.</description>

                The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has been widely studied as a promising means to convert anthropogenic CO2 into valuable chemicals and fuels. In this process, the alkali metal ions present in the electrolyte are known to significantly influence the CO2RR activity and selectivity. In this study, we report a strategy for preparing efficient electrocatalysts by introducing a cation&#8208;relaying ligand, namely 6&#8208;mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA), into atom&#8208;precise Au25 nanoclusters (NCs). The CO2RR activity of the synthesized Au25(MHA)18 NCs was compared with that of Au25(HT)18 NCs (HT = 1&#8208;hexanethiolate). While both NCs selectively produced CO over H2, the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity of the Au25(MHA)18 NCs was significantly higher than that of the Au25(HT)18 NCs when the catholyte pH was higher than the pKa of MHA, demonstrating the cation&#8208;relaying effect of the anionic terminal group. Mechanistic investigations into the CO2RR occurring on the Au25 NCs in the presence of different catholyte cations and concentrations revealed that the CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activities of these Au25 NCs increased in the order Li+ &lt; Na+ &lt; K+ &lt; Cs+, and are gated by the cation&#8208;coupled electron transfer step. These results were confirmed by the Nernstian shifts of the polarization curves at different cation concentrations.</description>

                Epicardial (Epi) access is commonly required during ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation. Conventional Epi (ConvEpi) access targets a "dry" pericardial space presenting technical challenges and risk of complications. Recently, intentional puncture of coronary venous (CV) branches with Epi carbon dioxide insufflation (EpiCO2) has been described as a technique to improve Epi access. The safety of this technique relative to conventional methods remains unproven. To compare the feasibility and safety of EpiCO2 to ConvEpi access. All patients at a high-volume center undergoing Epi access between 1/2021 and 12/2023 were included and grouped according to ConvEpi or EpiCO2 approaches. Access technique was according to the discretion of the operator. Epi access was attempted in 153 cases by 17 different operators (80 ConvEpi vs 73 EpiCO2). There was no difference in success rate whether ConvEpi or EpiCO2 approach was used (76 [95%] vs 67 [91.8%], p=0.4). Total Epi access time was shorter in the ConvEpi group compared to the EpiCO2 group (16.3&#177;11.6min vs 26.9&#177;12.7min, p&lt;0.001), though total procedure duration was similar. Major Epi-access related complications occurred in only the ConvEpi group (6 [7.5%] ConvEpi vs 0 [0%] EpiCo2, p=0.02). Bleeding &#8805; 80 mL was more frequently observed following ConvEpi access (14 [17.5%] vs 4 [5.5%], p=0.02). After adjusting for age, repeat Epi access and antithrombotic therapy, EpiCO2 was associated with a reduction in bleeding &#8805; 80 mL (OR=0.27, 95%CI 0.08 &#8211; 0.89, p=0.03). EpiCO2 access is associated with lower rates of major complication and bleeding when compared to ConvEpi access.</description>

      <title>Life Cycle Assessment of Wheat Straw Pyrolysis with Volatile Fractions Chemical Looping Combustion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16104013</link>

                Among the approaches to facilitating negative CO2 emissions is biochar production. Biochar is generated in the pyrolysis of certain biomasses. In the pyrolysis process, carbon in the biomass is turned into a solid, porous, carbon-rich, and stable material that can be captured from the soil after a period of from a few decades to several centuries. In addition to this long-term carbon sequestration role, biochar is also beneficial for soil performance as it helps to restore soil fertility and improves the retention and diffusion of water and nutrients. This work presents a Life Cycle Assessment of different pyrolysis approaches for biochar production. Biomass pyrolysis is performed in a fixed-bed reactor, which operates at a mild temperature (550 &#176;C). Biochar is obtained as solid product of the pyrolysis, but there are also liquid (bio-oil) and gaseous products (syngas). The pyrolysis gas is partly used to fulfil the energy demand of the pyrolysis process, which is highly endothermic. In the conventional approach, CO2 is produced during the combustion of syngas and emitted to the atmosphere. Another approach to facilitate CO2 capture and thus obtain more negative CO2 emissions in the pyrolysis process is burning syngas and bio-oil in a Chemical Looping Combustion unit. Life Cycle Assessment was performed of these approaches toward biomass pyrolysis to evaluate their environmental impact. The Chemical Looping Combustion approach significantly reduced the values of 7 of the 16 environmental impact indicators studied, along with the Global Warming Potential among them, it slightly increased the value of one indicator related to the use of fossil resources, and it maintained the values of the remaining 8 indicators. Environmental impact reduction occurs due to the avoidance of CO2 and NOx emissions with Chemical Looping Combustion. The CO2 balances of the different pyrolysis approaches with Chemical Looping Combustion configurations were compared with a base case, which constituted the direct combustion of wheat straw to obtain thermal energy. Direct biomass combustion for the production of 17.1 MJ of thermal energy had CO2 positive emissions of 0.165 kg. If the gaseous fraction was burned by Chemical Looping Combustion, CO2 was captured and the emissions became increasingly negative, until a value of &#8722;3.30 kg/17.1 MJ was generated. If bio-oil was also burned by this technology, the negative trend of CO2 emissions continued, until they reached a value of &#8722;3.66 kg.</description>

                The reduction of carbon emissions has become a critical global issue, and the use of monoethanolamine (MEA) solution for CO2 absorption is prevalent in industry. To elucidate the mass transfer mechanisms in reactive multiphase flow, we employed high-speed photography and digital image processing to examine the dynamics and mass transfer behavior of CO2 bubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell. The results indicate that as the MEA solution concentration increases, oscillations during bubble ascent diminish, and the terminal velocity decreases. Based on changes in the mass transfer coefficient, the reaction process can be segmented into a phase of intensified mass transfer, marked by a rapid decrease in bubble equivalent diameter, and a phase of deteriorating mass transfer, where the diameter stabilizes. Additionally, we introduced a dimensionless mathematical model for the Sherwood number based on experimental findings, and its reliability was confirmed.</description>

      <title>Two-stage day-ahead and intra-day scheduling considering Electric Arc Furnace control and wind power modal decomposition</title>

                As the uncertainty in energy supply increases, engaging various flexible resources in power systems has emerged as an effective strategy to address wind curtailment issues. Existing research insufficiently explores how EAFs can participate in reducing wind curtailment or optimizing flexible power system resources to decrease CO2 emissions from TTPs and enhance wind energy absorption across various timescales. This study introduces a dual timescale, dual-tier scheduling methodology incorporating EAF regulation and wind power modal decomposition. The day-ahead model integrates EAF demand response to decrease wind curtailment, a comprehensive wind power allocation, and a TTP carbon minimization model. The intra-day model employs wind power modal decomposition for optimizing BESSs within WFs and schedules TTPs to minimize CO2 emissions. Implemented through iterative genetic algorithms and CPLEX solver techniques, simulation results from a real-case scenario indicate that incorporating EAF loads reduces wind curtailment by 40.49% and cuts CO2 emissions by 2.5% in the day-ahead phase. Furthermore, by applying modal decomposition, TTPs and BESSs absorb fluctuating wind power components, ensuring maximal wind utilization and substantial CO2 reduction at TTPs. This approach offers vast potential to enhance power system flexibility, advance energy-intensive industries' transition, and foster low-carbon initiatives at TTPs.</description>

      <title>Integration of Chemical Looping Combustion in the Graz Power Cycle</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17102334</link>
      <description>Carlos Arnaiz del Pozo, Susana S&#225;nchez Orgaz, Alberto Navarro-Calvo, &#193;ngel Jim&#233;nez Alvaro, Schalk Cloete, Energies. 17(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396857828

                : Effective decarbonization of the power generation sector requires a multi-pronged approach, including the implementation of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technologies. The Graz cycle features oxy-combustion CO2 capture in a power production scheme which can result in higher thermal efficiencies than that of a combined cycle. However, the auxiliary consumption required by the air separation unit to provide pure O2 results in a significant energy penalty relative to an unabated plant. In order to mitigate this penalty, the present study explores the possibility of chemical looping combustion (CLC) as an alternative means to supply oxygen for conversion of the fuel. For a midscale power plant, despite reducing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by approximately 12.6% at a CO2 tax of EUR 100/ton and a natural gas price of EUR 6.5/GJ and eliminating the energy penalty of CCS relative to an unabated combined cycle, the cost reductions of CLC in the Graz cycle were not compelling relative to commercially available post-combustion CO2 capture with amines. Although the central assumptions yielded a 3% lower cost for the Graz-CLC cycle, an uncertainty quantification study revealed an 85.3% overlap in the interquartile LCOE range with that of the amine benchmark, indicating that the potential economic benefit is small compared to the uncertainty of the assessment. Thus, this study indicates that the potential of CLC in gas-fired power production is limited, even when considering highly efficient advanced configurations like the Graz cycle.</description>

      <title>Research on the Interaction Mechanisms between ScCO2 and Low-Rank / High-Rank Coal with ReaxFF-MD Force Field</title>

                CO2 geological sequestration in coal seams can achieve the dual objectives of CO2 emission reduction and enhanced coalbed methane production, making it a highly promising carbon capture and storage technology. However, the injection of CO2 into coal reservoirs in the form of supercritical fluid (ScCO2) leads to complex physicochemical reactions with the coal seam, altering the properties of the coal reservoir and impacting the effectiveness of CO2 sequestration and methane production enhancement.In this paper, theoretical calculations based on ReaxFF-MD were conducted to study the interaction mechanism between ScCO2 and the macromolecular structure of both low-rank and high-rank coal, to address the limitations of experimental methods. The reaction of ScCO2 with low-rank coal and high-rank coal exhibits significant differences. At swelling stage, the low-rank coal experiences a decrease in aromatic structure and aliphatic structure, high-rank coal shows an increase in aromatic structure and a decrease in aliphatic structure, while swelling phenomenon is more pronounced in high-rank coal. At dissolution stage, low-rank coal is initially decomposed into two secondary molecular fragments, and then recombine to form new molecular structure, the aromatic structure increased and the aliphatic structure decreased. In contrast, high-rank coal occurs stretches-breakage-movement-reconnection, a reduction in aromatic structure and an increase in aliphatic structure.The primary reasons for these variations lie in distinct molecular structure compositions and the properties of ScCO2, leading to different reaction pathways of functional group and aromatic structure. The reaction pathways of functional groups and aromatic structures in coal can be summarized as follows: the breakage of the O-H bond in hydroxyl groups, the breakage of the C-OH bond in carboxyl groups, transformation of aliphatic structures into smaller hydrocarbon compounds or formation of long-chain alkenes, and various pathways involving broken, rearrangement, recombination of aromatic structures. In low-rank coal, there is a higher abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups and aliphatic structures. The breakage of O-H and C-OH chemical bonds results in the formation of free radical ions, while some aliphatic structures detach to produce hydrocarbons. Additionally, some of these aliphatic structures combine with carbonyl groups and free radical ions to generate new aromatic structures. Conversely, in high-rank coal, the lower content of oxygen-containing functional groups and aliphatic structures, along with stronger intramolecular forces, results in fewer chemical bond breakages and makes it less conducive to the formation of new aromatic structures.These results elucidate the specific deformations of different chemical groups, offering a molecular-level understanding of the interaction between CO2 and coal.</description>

                Developing highly active and robust cathodes remains challenging for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Therefore, we report an A-site medium-entropy double perovskite oxide PrBa0.5Sr0.25Ca0.2Ce0.05Co2O5+&#948; (PBSCCC) and its electrocatalytic activity and CO2 tolerance property are systematically probed. The PBSCCC cathode exhibits excellent oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a low polarization resistance of 0.027 &#937; cm2 at 700 &#176;C. More importantly, compared to PrBaCo2O5+&#948; (PBC) and PrBa0.8Ca0.2Co2O5+&#948; (PBCC) oxides, its CO2 resistance is prominently enhanced with significantly less BaCO3 and Co3O4 impurities formed. The superior ORR performance and structure stability are mainly attributed to its high electrical conductivity and significantly reduced surface cation segregations. Our results show that the potential of PBSCCC as a cathode material for SOFCs is enormous and also prove the rationality and feasibility of entropy engineering for cathode development.</description>

                Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to ethanol has been widely researched for potential commercial application. However, it still faces limited selectivity at a large current density. Herein, Mo4+-doped CuS nanosheet-assembled hollow spheres are constructed to address this issue. Mo4+ ion doping modifies the local electronic environments and diversifies the binding sites of CuS, which increases the coverage of linear *COL and produces bridge *COB for subsequent *COL&#8211;*COH coupling toward ethanol production. The optimal Mo9.0%&#8211;CuS can electrocatalyze CO2 to ethanol with a faradaic efficiency of 67.5% and a partial current density of 186.5 mA cm&#8211;2 at &#8722;0.6 V in a flow cell. This work clarifies that doping high valence transition metal ions into Cu-based sulfides can regulate the coverage and configuration of related intermediates for ethanol production during the CO2RR in a flow cell.</description>

      <title>Active pairs of Cu0/Cu+ for CO2 hydrogenation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.101</link>
      <description>Wei Zhou, Mazhar Ahmed Memon, Mengmeng Niu, Xinqiang Fan, Yanan Jiang, Xinge Zhang, Yuan Liu, International journal of hydrogen energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396899909

                Copper (Cu) based catalysts are frequently used in CO2 hydrogenation, particularly in reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) and CO2-to-methanol reaction. Cu0 and Cu + are the key species affecting the catalyst performance and product distribution. Therefore, constructing and adjusting Cu0/Cu+ active pairs is significant for the catalyst design. In this study, Cu0/Cu+ active pairs are obtained by utilizing the properties of perovskite-type oxides (PTOs). A series of CaTi1-xCuxO3 and Ca0.8La0.2Ti1-xCuxO3 (x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.30, 0.40 and 0.50) were synthesized via citric acid complexing method and part of the Cu species entered the PTOs lattice. After reduction, large Cu particles and highly-dispersed Cu clusters were obtained simultaneously. The dispersed Cu clusters have more interfaces with the PTOs and provide abundant Cu + while large Cu particles tend to aggregate and supply mainly Cu0. Cu0 activates H2 and CO2 and plays a vital role in the rWGS reaction. Cu+ is the active site for methanol synthesis and it can strongly absorb CO. The ratio of Cu0/Cu + varies with different Cu content and doping La can also adjust the chemical state of surface Cu. The performance test demonstrates that both excessively high and low Cu0/Cu+ ratios are beneficial for CO generation, while a moderate ratio is suitable for methanol synthesis. These insights provide a method for regulating the chemical state of surface metal species and help the catalyst design for CO2 hydrogenation.</description>

      <title>Life Cycle Economic and Environmental Assessment of Producing Synthetic Jet Fuel Using CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/Biomass Feedstocks</title>

                The aviation industry is responsible for over 2% of global CO2 emissions. Synthetic jet fuels generated from biogenic feedstocks could help reduce life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to petroleum-based fuels. This study assesses three processes for producing synthetic jet fuel via the synthesis of methanol using water and atmospheric CO2 or biomass. A life cycle assessment and cost analysis are conducted to determine GHG emissions, energy demand, land occupation, water depletion, and the cost of producing synthetic jet fuel in Switzerland. The results reveal that the pathway that directly hydrogenates CO2 to methanol exhibits the largest reductions in terms of GHG emission (almost 50%) compared to conventional jet fuel and the lowest production cost (7.86 EUR kgJF&#8211;1); however, its production cost is currently around 7 times higher than the petroleum-based counterpart. Electrical energy was found to be crucial in capturing CO2 and converting water into hydrogen, with the sourcing and processing of the feedstocks contributing to 79% of the electric energy demand. Furthermore, significant variations in synthetic jet fuel cost and GHG emissions were shown when the electricity source varies, such as utilizing grid electricity pertaining to different countries with distinct electricity mixes. Thus, upscaling synthetic jet fuels requires energy-efficient supply chains, sufficient feedstock, large amounts of additional (very) low-carbon energy capacity, suitable climate policy, and comprehensive environmental analyses.</description>

                2,3-Diaryl propanoic acids are important structures as a result of their widespread presence in numerous bioactive compounds. However, the limitations of existing synthetic techniques include the requirement for costly catalysts and limited substrates. Here, we developed a novel electroreductive arylcarboxylation of alkenes with CO2 based on a radical&#8211;polar crossover pathway assisted by easily accessible dimethyl terephthalate as a reductive mediator. This method will provide an efficient strategy for the synthesis of 2,3-diarylpropanoic acids.</description>

                The reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction serves as a critical pathway for converting CO2 into diverse chemicals. The Mars&#8211;van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, which leverages lattice oxygen as the oxidant and oxygen vacancies as reductants, offers an alternative catalytic strategy for the selective RWGS reaction. While Mn-substituted SrTiO3 (i.e., SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3) has been shown to promote the RWGS reaction selectively via the MvK mechanism, achieving a sufficient conversion of CO2 necessitates elevated temperatures. This study investigated the effect of Pd-loaded SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 on the activation of adsorbed H2 molecules, which generated oxygen vacancies and enhanced CO2 conversion. Notably, 1.0 wt% Pd-loaded SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 yielded 13.4% of CO at 673 K, whereas pristine SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 and Pd-loaded SrTiO3 yielded negligible or minimal amount of CO. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements revealed that Pd promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies via both thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and kinetic studies revealed that the RWGS reaction over Pd-loaded SrTi0.8Mn0.2O3 proceeded primarily via the MvK mechanism with a partial contribution from the Langmuir&#8211;Hinshelwood mechanism. This study underscores the effectiveness of combining metal and MvK-type catalysts to enhance the efficiency of the RWGS reaction.</description>

                The mechanistic understanding of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) under electrochemical conditions is crucial for optimizing the overall catalytic performance. While electrolyte ions have received considerable attention, it remains unclear how the condition of interfacial cations modulates the CO2RR and the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we explore the CO2 activation and Volmer step representing the critical first electron transfer during the CO2RR and HER, respectively. This investigation involves manipulating the cation identity (K+, Li+, and H+) and concentration at Au&#8211;water interfaces, which is carried out via the slow-growth sampling approach integrated with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results demonstrate that the high local alkali metal cation (AM+) concentration facilitates the CO2RR following the order of 2K+ &gt; 1K+ &gt; 2Li+ &gt; 1Li+ &gt; 0AM+, and the highly promoted CO2 activation kinetics originate from the short-range coordination between alkali metal cations and reaction intermediates. However, the interfacial HER behaves very differently with the kinetic order of 1Li+ &gt; 0AM+ &gt; 1K+ &gt; 2Li+ &gt; 2K+, closely related to the interfacial water structures, which are affected by both cation identity and local concentrations. Overall, the activity and selectivity of the CO2RR at the Au&#8211;water interface can be enhanced by increasing the local cation concentration (K+ &gt; Li+). These findings highlight the critical roles of alkali metal cations and reaction microenvironments in modulating interfacial reaction kinetics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Cu&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;/Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Interface Promotes Acidic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electroreduction</title>

                Acidic CO2 electroreduction reaction (CO2RR) shows advantages in high carbon utilization efficiency yet encounters great challenges in suppressing undesired hydrogen evolution competition and increasing C2+ product selectivity. Although it is known that Cu0/Cu+ interfaces are conducive to C&#8211;C coupling processes, the oxidation state of copper cannot be well maintained under the strong reductive condition and large current electrolysis operation. Herein, we propose an I2 addition involved strategy to protect the oxidation state of Cu and promote dynamic Cu0/Cu+ interfaces during acidic CO2RR. With the addition of I2 in the electrolyte, a high C2+ product Faraday efficiency of above 70% can be achieved at 0.4&#8211;0.6 A cm&#8211;2 even under a low K+ concentration of 0.3 M, which is comparable to those reported performances with almost ten times higher K+ concentrations (2&#8211;3 M). This low K+ concentration in electrolytes significantly avoids salt crystallization in the CO2 transport channel to enhance the electrolyzer's stability. As proved by the surface Pourbaix diagram and experimental results, adding excessive I2 into the electrolyte boosts the generation of CuI; also, CuI and metallic Cu coexist under electrochemical reduction conditions, demonstrating that a redox loop of Cu &#8594; CuI &#8594; Cu exists. The loop holds the key to constructing the dynamic Cu0/Cu+ interface, which is tightly bound to the adsorption of the *CO reaction intermediate and further promotes the C&#8211;C coupling process.</description>

      <title>Effect of elevation feedbacks and climate mitigation on future Greenland ice sheet melt</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1126</link>
      <description>Thirza Nadine Feenstra, Miren Vizca&#237;no, Bert Wouters, Michele Petrini, Raymond Sellevold, Katherine Thayer&#8208;Calder, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396865280

                Abstract. The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) stores freshwater equal to more than seven meters of potential sea level rise and strongly interacts with the Arctic, North Atlantic and global climate. Over the last decades, the GrIS has been losing mass and is projected to lose mass at an increasing rate. Interactions between the GrIS and the climate have the potential to amplify or reduce GrIS mass balance responses to ongoing and projected warming. Here, we investigate the impact of ice sheet-climate interactions on the climate and mass balance of the GrIS using the Community Ice Sheet Model version 2 coupled to the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2-CISM2). To this end, we compare two idealized simulations with a nonevolving and evolving ice sheet topography in which we apply an annual 1 % increase in CO2 concentrations until stabilization at four times pre-industrial (PI) CO2 concentrations (4xCO2). By comparing the 1- and 2-way coupled simulations, we find significant changes in atmospheric blocking, precipitation and cloud formation over Greenland as the GrIS topography evolves, acting as negative feedbacks on mass loss. We also find that a uniform temperature lapse rate represents temperature changes in the ablation area, leading to an overestimation of the positive melt-elevation feedback in the 1-way coupled simulation, resulting in an overestimation of mass loss. Furthermore, we analyze an idealized simulation in which we first apply a 4xPI CO2 forcing and thereafter annually reduce atmospheric CO2 by 5 % until PI concentrations are reached. During the 350 year 4xCO2 forcing period, the ice sheet loses a total mass of 1.1 m sea level equivalent, and part of its margins retreat landward. When the PI CO2 concentration is restored, melt decreases rapidly, leading to a small positive surface mass balance. Combined with the strongly reduced ice discharge resulting from the widespread retreat of the ice sheet margin, this results in the halting of GrIS mass loss, despite a remaining global warming of 2 K. The GrIS, Arctic and North Atlantic ocean strongly interact, causing a complex transitional phase towards a colder climate during the century following the CO2 reduction. Elevated atmospheric temperatures, larger ocean heat transport and a deteriorated state of the snowpack, compared to the initial pre-industrial state, result in limited regrowth of the ice sheet under reintroduced PI CO2 conditions.</description>

                Ground heat is a renewable energy source that is less affected by atmospheric temperature and maintains a nearly constant temperature throughout the year. Therefore, it can serve as a heat source for hot water and air conditioning systems, resulting in a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to conventional systems. In Japan, the recognition of the use of ground heat is still low, and the prices of ground heat exchangers and geothermal heat pumps tend to be high. In addition, the excavation cost is very high, so it is very important to reduce the construction cost. One cost-saving method is to install a ground heat exchanger in the core material of the earth retaining wall, which has been shown to reduce construction costs by more than 50%. In this study, a numerical program was developed to clarify the performance and characteristics of a ground heat exchanger attached to an H-beam in a "Pre-installation method using the earth retaining wall". Then, the factors influencing the heat extraction performance of two U-Tube heat exchangers connected in series, four U-Tube heat exchangers connected in series and two W-Tube heat exchangers connected in series were investigated. Firstly, the validity of the calculation program was confirmed by comparing the numerical results with the experimental thermal response results. Secondly, numerical simulations were performed using the calculation program, and the following results were obtained. Under the conditions defined in this study, we found that the rate of heat extraction increases as the flow rate of the heat extraction medium increases in all ground heat exchangers. However, it becomes difficult to increase the heat extraction when the flow of the heat extraction medium reaches a turbulent area. All three models confirmed that the H-beam expanded the area where the formation temperature changes and increased the temperature of the heat extraction medium. This led to an enhanced heat extraction performance of the ground heat exchanger. Finally, we compared the heat extraction performance of several ground heat exchangers using the 'coefficient of heat extraction or rejection'. The results showed that the four U-Tube model had the highest performance, followed by the two W-Tube model, and the two U-Tube model had the lowest performance, although the differences were small.</description>

                Increasing energy efficiency will be crucial to achieving the climate goals laid out in European Uniondirectives. This is particularly true for industries whose share of heat and energy consumption,with Poland as an example, is about one-third of the total. This challenge entails implicationsboth for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2, and for maintaining thecompetitiveness of EU industry on the global market. This article presents the basic principlesand application of an Energy Management System &#8211; EMS &#8211; in industrial processes, together withthe monitoring of Key Energy Performance Indicators &#8211; KPIs &#8211; as a tool for making informedinvestment decisions to improve the energy efficiency of companies and industrial processes. Anattempt is made to present the situation in Poland in terms of the energy situation, with a focus onthe automotive industry as an example.</description>

                We combined ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) surface science techniques, electrochemical measurements, and computational modeling to investigate electrocatalytic systems that are crucial components of the carbon management effort, including oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and CO2 reduction reactions (CO2RR). Well-defined Model catalysts were grown on substrates in the UHV chamber and characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Selected model electrocatalysts were then tested in electrochemical cells to establish the structure-property relationships in OER and CO2RR. Our results showed that the edge sites of Fe2O3 grown on Au(111) were the most active toward OER and incorporation of Ni at the edge sites (NiFeOx) further boosted their OER activity. We also resolved the size-dependent electrocatalytic CO2-to-CO conversion of the Ag nanoparticle electrocatalysts with average particle diameter between 2 to 6 nm: smaller diameter (&lt; 3 nm) particles favored H2 evolution reaction (HER) due to a high population of Ag edge sites, whereas larger diameter particles favored CO2RR as the population of Ag(100) surface sites grew. We further discovered that electronic interactions between small diameter Ag particles and highly defective carbon supports could break the size-dependent CO2RR selectivity, resulting in highly selective (CO Faradaic Efficiency &gt; 90%) and active Ag nanoparticle electrocatalysts with sizes &lt; 2 nm diameter.</description>

                The pressure-swing distillation traditionally used in the industry for separating dimethyl carbonate/methanol (DMC/MeOH) commonly suffers from high energy consumption and challenges in achieving high-purity separation due to the existence of pinch zone. Hence, energy-saving extractive distillation system is explored to achieve the high-purity separation of DMC/MeOH azeotrope. With the analyses of isovolatility and residue curve maps based on Wilson model calibrated by vapor&#8211;liquid equilibrium experimental data, an extractive distillation process using O-Xylene (OX) as the most suitable entrainer were modeled and validated by using extractive distillation experiment. Furthermore, the design, optimization, and comparison of a 10000 t/a DMC extractive distillation process and a pressure-swing distillation process are investigated. It is demonstrated that the extractive distillation process presents significant economic and emission advantage, specifically with 34.66 % and 26.95 % reductions in operating cost (OC) and in total annual cost (TAC) respectively, as well as 42.53 % reduction in CO2 emissions. This work should provide a feasible and promising approach to energy saving, low-carbon, and high-purity separation of DMC/MeOH azeotrope.</description>

                Electrocatalysis plays a crucial role in the production of renewable clean fuels and carbon reduction. However, the catalytic efficiency of transition metal-based electrocatalysts often falls short due to unfavorable surface structures. To address this challenge, the phase transition technique has emerged as a promising surface structure optimization strategy that can modify the crystal and electronic structure of catalysts, thereby enhancing their electrocatalytic efficiency. This comprehensive review explores the mechanism of phase transition in catalysts and its potential for enhancing electrocatalysis. It provides an in-depth analysis of commonly employed phase transition strategies for transition metal-based materials and discusses the characterization techniques used to observe the phase transition process. The significance of the phase transition strategy in electrocatalysis is elucidated through the lens of key reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction, hydrogen evolution reaction, and CO2 reduction reaction. Furthermore, the review addresses the challenges associated with implementing phase transition strategies to achieve advanced catalytic performance. By providing valuable insights, this review aims to inspire further research in phase transition modulation, paving the way for the advancement of the catalysts that contribute to sustainable and eco-friendly energy production.</description>

                This study offers an in-depth analysis and optimization of a microgrid system powered by renewable sources, designed for the efficient production of hydrogen and dimethyl ether&#8212;key elements in the transition toward sustainable fuel alternatives. The system architecture incorporates solar photovoltaic modules, advanced battery storage solutions, and electrolytic hydrogen production units, with a targeted reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the enhancement of overall energy efficiency. A rigorous economic analysis was conducted utilizing the HYSYS V12 software platform and encompassing capital and operational expenditures alongside profit projections to evaluate the system&#8217;s economic viability. Furthermore, thermal optimization was achieved through heat integration strategies, employing a cascade analysis methodology and optimization via the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS), yielding an 83% decrease in annual utility expenditures. Comparative analysis revealed that the energy requirement of the optimized system was over 50% lower than that of traditional fossil fuel-based reforming processes. A comprehensive assessment of CO2 emissions demonstrated a significant reduction, with the integration of thermal management solutions facilitating a 99.24% decrease in emissions. The outcomes of this study provide critical insights into the engineering of sustainable, low-carbon energy systems, emphasizing the role of renewable energy technologies in advancing fuel science.</description>

                The circular economy has come with momentum to settle in the countries as a new model of economic growth. Thus, sustainable development and the objectives set forth by the United Nations for its achievement and expansion highlight the concern and preoccupation of society for these issues. For this reason, this chapter deals with four specific aspects of the agricultural industry sector, which aim to improve our lives and the sustainability of our planet. These aspects refer to the use of biomass residues and their contribution to the food sector, the generation of biofuel and electricity from biogas for agricultural use, as well as the reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation. Finally, a decrease in cotton production and the use of regenerated cotton by the textile industry will be considered. Based on the theoretical framework, four specific proposals are established to achieve the aggregate global growth requirement posed by Sustainable Development Goal 8, compared to the reduction in the use of CO2, together with the reduction in the use of resources (Goals 6, 7, 9, 12 and 15). These proposals cover aspects such as the reuse of organic and biodegradable wastes, the reuse of water through different irrigation methods and its application based on its components, and the reuse of cotton from existing clothing. All of this provides economic agents, administration, companies, and households with opportunities for reflection and implementation of a more sustainable economic and social model.</description>

      <title>Review on Mercury Control during Co-Firing Coal and Biomass under O2/CO2 Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app14104209</link>
      <description>Qiang Lyu, Fei Xin, Applied sciences. 14(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396964526

                Combining biomass co-firing with oxy-fuel combustion is a promising Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technology. It has the potential to achieve a large-scale reduction in carbon emissions from traditional power plants, making it a powerful tool for addressing global climate change. However, mercury in the fuel can be released into the flue gas during combustion, posing a significant threat to the environment and human health. More importantly, mercury can also cause the fracture of metal equipment via amalgamation, which is a major risk for the system. Therefore, compared to conventional coal-fired power plants, the requirements for the mercury concentration in BECCS systems are much stricter. This article reviews the latest progress in mercury control under oxy-fuel biomass co-firing conditions, clarifies the impact of biomass co-firing on mercury species transformation, reveals the influence mechanisms of various flue gas components on elemental mercury oxidation under oxy-fuel combustion conditions, evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of various mercury removal methods, and finally provides an outlook for mercury control in BECCS systems. Research shows that after biomass co-firing, the concentrations of chlorine and alkali metals in the flue gas increase, which is beneficial for homogeneous and heterogeneous mercury oxidation. The changes in the particulate matter content could affect the transformation of gaseous mercury to particulate mercury. The high concentrations of CO2 and H2O in oxy-fuel flue gas inhibit mercury oxidation, while the effects of NOx and SO2 are dual-sided. Higher concentrations of fly ash in oxy-fuel flue gas are conducive to the removal of Hg0. Additionally, under oxy-fuel conditions, CO2 and metal ions such as Fe2+ can inhibit the re-emission of mercury in WFGD systems. The development of efficient adsorbents and catalysts is the key to achieving deep mercury removal. Fully utilizing the advantages of chlorine, alkali metals, and CO2 in oxy-fuel biomass co-firing flue gas will be the future focus of deep mercury removal from BECCS systems.</description>

                Methanol is considered as an essential base chemical, which is widely known for its versatility and broad potential use contexts in future chemical industries and energy storage applications. Methanol production pathways powered by renewable electricity sources, also known as power-to-methanol processes, are characterized by low specific life-cycle emissions and are therefore of paramount interest. One possible renewable process chain features proton-conducting high temperature electrolyzers combined with a direct hydrogenation of CO2. In this paper, a techno-economic forecast study of this process chain is presented and specific production costs of renewable methanol under different electricity supply scenarios are determined and discussed for the years 2030 and 2050. The studies showed that flexible grid-supported scenarios through direct spot-market participation and renewable scenarios enable the largest production cost reduction potential in the upcoming decades.</description>

      <title>Effects of steam feeding on microwave heating of cellulose with magnetite used as susceptor</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.261</link>

                Microwave heating (MWH) of lignocellulosic biomass with susceptors has attracted attention for H2 production. In this study, H2 is produced from cellulose via MWH at 800 &#176;C in a steam atmosphere with magnetite used as the susceptor. The effects of steam feeding and MWH on the product yields are experimentally investigated in comparison with conventional heating (CH). The H2 and CO2 yields are increased by steam feeding for both MWH and CH because the water&#8211;gas shift reaction occurs. Without steam feeding, MWH enhances H2 and CO production, thereby increasing the maximum energy efficiency. With steam feeding, the steam gasification of C is more predominant for CH than for MWH as the reduction in the C content in the char of CH is higher than that of MWH. MWH reduces the formation of secondary char, and it is therefore expected to overcome issues such as the clogging or blockage of gas lines.</description>

                Magnetron sputtering (MS) is a very promising approach for electrode preparation due to its versatility, environmental benignity, and sustainability. In particular, by allowing high control of the deposited nanostructures, MS is characterized by: high deposition rates at low temperatures, deposition of complex species just selecting a specific target, high-density films, and outstanding adhesion of the films on supports. In the following study, the preparation by MS, and thus avoiding toxic chemical reagents, of NbRe thin films, for both hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), was reported. Firstly, the electrocatalytic activity of NbRe thin films was tested towards HER showing promising performance: negligible overpotentials and very small Tafel slopes. Secondly, in the context of carbon recycling, and considering renewable sources intermittence, the electrodes were tested towards CO2RR, obtaining selectively C3 compounds. Overall, the proposed study aims to contribute to the development of sustainable catalytic electrochemical processes, supporting the ecological transition.</description>

      <title>Driving a Deficient Cathodic Environment Using Anode to Control Selectivity for Co2 Electroreduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4829136</link>
      <description>D. S. Kim, Man Ho Han, Jae Yong Park, Hyunchul Kim, Hyeon&#8208;Seok Bang, Seungho Yu, Jae&#8208;Young Choi, Hyung&#8208;Suk Oh, Woong Hee Lee, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396941721

                The anode has not been extensively studied in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) systems because it is believed to have no significant effect on the catalytic selectivity and activity of the cathode. Herein, we report that the anode can indeed influence the catalytic activity of the CO2RR by regulating the transfer of water and ions in a membrane electrode assembly. Despite employing identical cathode conditions, we observed optimal ethylene production at different current densities for distinct anode substrates: carbon paper (CP) and Ti meshes. Based on the results of in situ/operando analysis and transparent cell tests, CP creates an environment deficient in water and cations, thereby promoting local pH effects. Consequently, this leads to a higher valence state of Cu during the CO2RR, resulting in increased catalytic activity for ethylene production. However, in the high-current-density region, the catalytic activity of CP degrades due to the uneven distribution of the reaction. Our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the reaction environment for CO2RR and offers insights for optimizing the catalytic activity of CO2RR systems.</description>

                In this work, La(FeCuMnMgTi)O3 HEO nanoparticles with a perovskite-type structure are synthesized and used in the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The catalyst demonstrates high performance as an electrocatalyst for the CO2RR, with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 92.5% at a current density of 21.9 mA cm&#8211;2 under &#8722;0.75 V vs a saturated calomel electrode (SCE). Particularly, an FE above 54% is obtained for methyl isopropyl ketone (C5H10O, MIPK) at a partial current density of 16 mA cm&#8211;2, overcoming all previous works. Besides, the as-prepared HEO catalyst displays robust stability in the CO2RR. The excellent catalytic performance of La(FeCuMnMgTi)O3 is ascribed to the synergistic effect between the electronic effects associated with five cations occupying the high-entropy sublattice sites and the oxygen vacancies within the perovskite structure of the HEO. Finally, DFT calculations indicate that Cu plays a vital role in the catalytic activity of the La(FeCuMnMgTi)O3 HEO nanoparticles toward C2+ products.</description>

      <title>In the Pursuit of Greenness: Drivers and Consequences of Green Corporate Revenues</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4823664</link>

                Corporate revenues from environmentally friendly products and services are surging, having reached US$4.69 trillion worldwide in 2023. In this paper, I provide a comprehensive evaluation of these green revenues across countries over the 2008-2023 period. I find that foreign institutional ownership, particularly from countries with stringent environmental norms and regulations, significantly increases green revenue intensity. This correlation is further supported by evidence from index inclusions, indicating a causal relationship. Additionally, firms that tie executive compensation to ESG goals and those with gender-diverse leadership show enhanced green revenue intensity. Leveraging the EU Green Deal as a natural experiment, I demonstrate that increases in green revenues are associated with reductions in CO2 emissions and enhancements in environmental policies and profitability. These effects are mostly concentrated in carbon-intensive industries. Overall, these findings highlight how environmental considerations are integral to shaping corporate strategies and illustrate the pivotal role of institutional investors in fostering the green transition.</description>

      <title>Realizing extraordinary bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of layered perovskite through Ba-site Gd doping toward oxygen reduction and evolution reactions</title>

                Herein we propose a Ba-site Gd doping protocol in layered perovskites, demonstrating highly active bifunctional PrBa1-xGdxCo2O5+&#948; electrocatalysts toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from enhanced oxygen surface exchange and chemical diffusion kinetics, resultant PrBa0.95Gd0.05Co2O5+&#948; (PBG0.05CO) exhibits an area-specific resistance (ASR) of 0.038 &#937; cm2 at 700 oC, reduced by &#8764;46.5% relative to undoped PrBaCo2O5+&#948; (PBCO). When evaluated as the air electrode, the as-fabricated single coin fuel cell delivers a peak power density (PPD) of 1230 mW cm-2 at 700 oC. For the CO2-electrolysis at 750 oC, the large current density (J) of 2630 mA cm-2 is achieved in the PBG0.05CO anode-based electrolysis cell at a voltage (V) of 1.8 V. Furthermore, exceptional operating stability is realized in both ORR and OER manners. Our findings highlight an effective strategy to optimize the electrocatalytic properties of layered perovskites, endowing potential applications in energy storage and conversion aspects.</description>

      <title>Metal Synergy in Pd-Ni Bimetallics</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.33540/2361</link>
      <description>Florian Zand, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396873269

                This thesis aims to enhance our understanding of metal segregation in supported bimetallic catalysts, to maximize the synergy between metals. It covers the assessment, effects, and origin of metal segregation as exemplified by supported alloyed Pd-Ni nanoparticles. To assess the degree and type of metal segregation in detail, we introduce a novel analytical technique to study industrial mesoporous catalysts &#8211; atom probe tomography (APT). Due to its nature, measuring mesoporous catalysts was not yet possible with APT, thus we have developed a resin-based sample preparation approach. This enables to unravel sub-nm compositional heterogeneities within/between nanoparticles, which is crucial for the optimization of industrial catalysts. With this upgraded arsenal of analytical techniques, we investigated the origins and effects of metal segregation for bimetallic catalysts prepared via industrially relevant incipient wetness impregnation. It spans most of the catalyst&#8217;s lifetime from precursor decomposition during calcination, alloy formation during reduction, and restructuring under steady and modulating operating conditions. Hereby, we elucidate the pathways for alloy formation for less uniform catalyst materials, describe the origin of reduction promotion, and showcase the catalyst&#8217;s state under operando conditions. However, next to revealing pathways which lead to alloy formation, we shed light on the origins leading to metal segregation. Therefore, we followed the metal precursor decomposition using different gas atmospheres. This allowed to assess the degree of metal segregation and pinpointed which role the decomposition of precursors plays. Finally, we elucidated how metal segregation/alloying between Pd and Ni affects catalysis mechanistically for both CO2 hydrogenation and chitosan depolymerization.</description>

      <title>Effect of a Hybrid Pumice&#8211;Portland Cement Extract on Corrosion Activity of Stainless Steel SS304 and Carbon Mild Steel A36</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17102255</link>
      <description>David J. Bonfil, L. V&#233;leva, J.I. Escalante-Garc&#305;&#769;a, Materials. 17(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396857313

                The change in the corrosion activities of SS304 and the carbon steel A36 were studied during their exposure for 30 days to hybrid pumice-Portland cement extract (CE), to simulate the concrete&#8211;pore environment. The ionic composition and the initial pH (12.99) of the CE were influenced by the reduction of Portland cement (PC) content, volcanic pumice oxides and alkaline activators. Because of the air CO2 dissolution, the pH decreased and maintained a constant value &#8776; 9.10 (established dynamic ionic equilibrium). The CE promoted the passivation of both steels and their free corrosion potential (OCP) reached positive values. On the surfaces, Fe and Cr oxides were formed, according to the nature of the steel. Over the time of exposure, the presence of chloride ions in the pumice caused a localized pitting attack, and for carbon steel, this fact may indicate an intermediate risk of corrosion. The chloride effect was retarded by the accumulation of SO42&#8722; ions at the steel surfaces. Based on electrochemical impedance (EIS), the polarization resistance (Rp) and the thickness of the passive layers were calculated. Their values were compared with those previously reported for the steels exposed to CEs of Portland and supersulfated cements, and the hybrid cement was considered as a PC &#8220;green&#8221; alternative.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic and Environmental Analysis of the Integration of PV Systems into Hybrid Vessels</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17102303</link>
      <description>Lewis McAllister, Haibin Wang, Energies. 17(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396858255

                Solar energy is one type of clean energy resource, and currently the IMO, EU and UK are targeting net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This paper delves into the integration of photovoltaic (PV) systems into hybrid vessels in order to meet their strategies and targets. The technical challenges that come with designing such systems as well as their economic and environmental impacts are examined. By optimizing the usage of harnessed solar energy, we discover the operational strategy that provides maximal benefits through day-to-day savings as well as over the 25 year lifespan of solar panels. It demonstrates impressive economic viability, with cost savings of up to GBP 4.55 per day and a payoff period as short as 9 years. It also displays a modest emission reduction of up to 8.002 kg of CO2, which serves as proof for a pathway to greener practices in the maritime industry. This report highlights the operational flexibility that a hybrid vessel possesses once paired with a PV system through the ability to withstand regulatory and market changes. Also, when looking ahead, further adoption of PV technology creates opportunities for innovation in adopting renewable energy solutions in maritime transportation.</description>

      <title>Influence of Hf Doping on the Oxygen Behaviors on ZrCo(110) Surface Using First-Principles Calculation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17102424</link>
      <description>Ruijun Qian, . Habibullah, Meitong Ye, Wanglai Cen, Chaoling Wu, Materials. 17(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4397002179

                ZrCo alloy is easily poisoned by impurity gases such as O2, CO, and CO2, resulting in a deterioration in hydrogen storage performance. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the adsorption and dissociation characteristics of oxygen on the ZrCo(110) surface using first-principles calculations. Previous studies indicated that the anti-disproportionation properties of ZrCo alloy can be significantly improved by Hf substitution, but the effect of Hf doping on the anti-poisoning properties has not been reported. We also examined the effect of Hf doping on the adsorption, dissociation, and diffusion characteristics of oxygen. It is found that on the ZrCo(110) surface, O2 molecules are easily dissociated and then stably adsorbed at the hollow site. Oxygen atoms will fill the surface preferentially and then diffuse inward. The doping of Hf has an insignificant impact on the adsorption or dissociation behavior of oxygen in comparison to the pure ZrCo surface. However, a notable observation is that the doping of Hf resulted in a reduction in the diffusion barrier for oxygen from the surface to the subsurface by 0.61 eV. Consequently, our study suggests that doping Hf is not an advisable strategy for improving the ZrCo(110) surface&#8217;s resistance to O2 poisoning because of improved oxygen permeability.</description>

      <title>From wreckage to resource: Advanced 3D printing materials from construction waste for energy infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0201775</link>
      <description>Zhouyi Lai, Yuancai Chen, Journal of renewable and sustainable energy. 16(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396891081

                This study redefines resource efficiency in the renewable energy sector by repurposing construction waste into high-performance thixotropic soils for additive manufacturing. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that these engineered soils achieve compressive strengths up to 30 MPa&#8212;indicating a 50% increase over traditional substrates&#8212;and flexural strengths reaching 5 MPa. Rigorous life cycle assessments quantify a reduction in carbon emissions by 20% and a resource efficiency enhancement to 85%, surpassing conventional materials which average 500 kg CO2 eq/ton in carbon footprint and 60% in resource efficiency. Fine-tuned 3D printing parameters deliver unparalleled precision, achieving layer accuracy to &#177;0.1 mm and reducing material wastage by 30%, while accelerating construction timelines by 40%. Additionally, the materials exhibit thermal stability with only a 0.1% variation under elevated temperatures and a durability that sustains less than 0.5 MPa degradation over a 10-month period. These quantitatively robust results support the thixotropic soils' adoption, not just as a sustainable choice but as a superior alternative to conventional building materials, setting a new paradigm in the construction of environmentally resilient and economically viable renewable energy infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Engineering Ultrathin CuxS Layer on Planar Sb2S3 Photocathode to Enhance Photoelectrochemical Transformation</title>

                Sb2S3 has been extensively used as light absorber for photoelectrochemical cell. However, its p&#8208;type nature may result in the formation of Schottky junction with substrates, thus hindering the collection of photogenerated holes. Herein, an ultrathin CuxS layer is successfully engineered as the bottom junction for Sb2S3 for the first time. Capitalizing on its impressive electrical properties and superior optical properties, the CuxS layer exhibits a high work function of 4.90 eV, which causes the upward band bending of p&#8208;type Sb2S3, forming a hole&#8208;transparent structure with ohmic contact. The transparency of the ultrathin CuxS layer enables back&#8208;illumination of the Sb2S3/CuxS platform, facilitating the integration of intricate catalyst layers for photoelectrochemical transformation. When modified with Pt nanoparticles, the photocurrent density reaches &#8722;5.38 mA cm&#8722;2 at 0 V vs. RHE, marking a fourfold increase compared to the photocathode without CuxS layer. When introducing a molecular hybrid TC&#8208;CoPc@carbon black, a remarkable average photocurrent density of &#8722;0.44 mA cm&#8722;2 at the overpotential of 0 V is obtained for CO2 reduction reaction, while the photocurrent density is less than &#8722;0.03 mA cm&#8722;2 without CuxS.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation of the Radioactive Content of Ashes Obtained from the Use of Fuels from Recycled Materials by Co-Processing in the Cement Industry</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17102287</link>
      <description>J.A. Su&#225;rez-Navarro, Miguel &#193;ngel Sanju&#225;n, Pedro Mora, Ma del Mar Alonso, Materials. 17(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396857909

                The co-processing of different wastes as fuels in the manufacture of cement clinker not only meets the objectives of a circular economy but also contributes to the reduction in CO2 emissions in the manufacture of Portland cement. However, waste used as alternative fuels, such as sludge or organic-rich residues, may contain naturally occurring radionuclides that can be concentrated during the combustion process. In this study, the presence of natural radionuclides (radioactive series of uranium, thorium, and 40K) and anthropogenic radionuclides (137Cs) in these wastes has been investigated by gamma spectrometry. Possible relationships between the radioactive content and the obtained chemical composition, determined by X-ray fluorescence, have also been studied by applying a principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that the wastes with the highest radioactive content were sewage sludge with activity concentrations of 238U and 210Pb of 321 &#177; 38 Bq kg&#8722;1 and 110 &#177; 14 Bq kg&#8722;1, respectively. A correlation between radioactive content and Fe2O3 concentration was also observed. The annual effective dose rates to workers for the ashes estimated from the ash content ranged from 0.0033 mSv to 0.092 mSv and therefore do not pose a risk to workers as they are lower than the 1 mSv per year limit for the general public (DIRECTIVE 2013/59/EURATOM).</description>

                This paper presents an in-depth analysis of decarbonizing the electricity sector in the Dominican Republic, pivotal for addressing climate change and fostering economic growth. Employing the robust-decision making methodology, we studied multiple scenarios via computational models, capturing inputs from stakeholders and evaluating each scenario across 1,000 futures to capture deep uncertainty. Four scenarios were examined: baseline, reference, natural gas, and renewable. The renewable scenario emerged as the most advantageous, proposing the replacement of coal-fired power generation with renewable sources, primarily solar and wind, coupled with batteries. A significant investment, averaging US$3.3 billion, is necessary for this shift toward renewable energy; however, these investments are overcompensated by savings in operational costs. Crucially, this transition promises substantial benefits by 2050: an estimated cumulative average net economic gain of US$2.7 billion, an 8% reduction in average generation costs in 2050, the creation of 160,000 direct jobs, and the avoidance of circa 140 million tons of CO2. The findings underscore the feasibility and economic viability of transitioning to a 55% renewable energy generation by 2050. The study offers a critical roadmap for policymakers, highlighting renewable energy expansion, transmission grid strengthening, and strategic coal generation replacement, thus offering a comprehensive blueprint for the nation's energy transition.</description>

      <title>Corrosion Enhancement of PM Processed Magnesium by Turning Native Oxide on Mg Powders into Carbonates</title>

                In addition to its use as a lightweight material, pure magnesium is a promising candidate for prospective bioimplants considering its excellent biocompatible properties. Regardless of what Mg application is used, the ultimate goal is to improve magnesium's mechanical properties and degradation behaviour. Because of the high affinity for oxygen native oxide layer of gas-atomized powders is naturally formed in contact with the atmosphere. S/TEM investigation of the native oxide of the Mg powder particles revealed a nonhomogeneous nano-crystalline MgO layer. MgO is relatively soluble in water and does not provide sufficient corrosion protection. Among various surface treatment methods, conversion of the non-protective magnesium oxide to carbonate products is possible depending on the environmental conditions. This work used a simple experimental method using CO2 and water vapour to achieve surface carbonation of Mg powders. Two carbonated samples and pure magnesium were prepared by direct extrusion. The samples after carbonation retained good mechanical properties and the layer of carbonates had a significant impact on corrosion resistance. 1 day carbonation resulted in transformation of native oxide into amorphous layer and reduction of corrosion rate. Longer carbonation (10 days) revealed layer growth and transformation of native oxide to crystalline nesquehonite structure.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Electrocatalytic Kinetics via Synergy of Co Nanoparticles and Co/Ni&#8211;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;C- and N-Doped Porous Carbon</title>

                Transition-metal species embedded in carbon have sparked intense interest in the fields of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, improvement of the electrocatalytic kinetics remains a challenge caused by the synergistic assembly. Here, we propose a biochemical strategy to fabricate the Co nanoparticles (NPs) and Co/Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;C co-embedded N-doped porous carbon (CoNPs&amp;Co/Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;C@NC) catalysts via constructing the zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)@yeast precursor. The rich amino groups provide the possibility for the anchorage of Co2+/Ni2+ ions as well as the construction of Co/Ni&#8211;ZIF@yeast through the yeast cell biomineralization effect. The functional design induces the formation of CoNPs and Co/Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;C sites in N-doped carbon as well as regulates the porosity for exposing such sites. Synergy of CoNPs, Co/Ni&#8211;N4&#8211;C, and porous N-doped carbon delivered excellent electrocatalytic kinetics (the ORR Tafel slope of 76.3 mV dec&#8211;1 and the OER Tafel slope of 80.4 mV dec&#8211;1) and a high voltage of 1.15 V at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 for the discharge process in zinc air batteries. It provides an effective strategy to fabricate high-performance catalysts.</description>

      <title>Study on the Environmental Impact and Benefits of Incorporating Humus Composites in Anaerobic Co-Digestion Treatment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics12050360</link>
      <description>Ke Zhao, Qiang Wang, Meng-Xin Bai, Mengnan Shen, Toxics. 12(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396853666

                This study evaluated the environmental impact and overall benefits of incorporating humus composites in the anaerobic co-digestion of kitchen waste and residual sludge. The life cycle assessment method was used to quantitatively analyze the environmental impact of the entire anaerobic co-digestion treatment process of waste, including garbage collection, transportation, and final product utilization. Moreover, the comprehensive assessment of the environmental impact, energy-saving and emission-reduction abilities, and economic cost of using humus composites in the anaerobic co-digestion treatment process was conducted using a benefit analysis method. The results showed that the anaerobic co-digestion of kitchen waste and residual sludge significantly contributed to the mitigation of global warming potential (GWP), reaching &#8722;19.76 kgCO2-eq, but had the least impact on the mitigation of acidification potential (AP), reaching &#8722;0.10 kgSO2-eq. In addition, the addition of humus composites significantly increased the production of biogas. At a concentration of 5 g/L, the biogas yield of the anaerobic co-digestion process was 70.76 m3, which increased by 50.62% compared with the blank group. This amount of biogas replaces ~50.52 kg of standard coal, reducing CO2 emissions by 13.74 kg compared with burning the same amount of standard coal. Therefore, the anaerobic co-digestion treatment of kitchen waste and residual sludge brings considerable environmental benefits.</description>

      <title>Effects of atmospheric pressure, and of the partial pressures of CO2 and N2, on the growth rates of Anabaena sp. PCC 7938: Assessment and implications for cyanobacterium cultivation on Mars</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4348078/v1</link>
      <description>Cyprien Verseux, Tiago P Ramalho, Emma Bohuon, Nils Kunst, Viktoria Lang, Christiane Heinicke, Research Square (Research Square). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396868615

                Abstract In situ resource utilization systems based on cyanobacteria could support the sustainability of crewed missions to Mars. However, their resource-efficiency will depend on the extent to which gases from the Martian atmosphere must be processed to support cyanobacterial growth. The main purpose of the present work is to help assess this extent. We therefore start with investigating the impact of changes in atmospheric conditions on the photoautotrophic, diazotrophic growth of the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7938. We show that lowering atmospheric pressure from 1 bar down to 80 hPa, without changing the partial pressures of metabolizable gases, does not reduce growth rates. We also provide equations, analogous to Monod&#8217;s, that describe the dependence of growth rates on the partial pressures of CO2 and N2. We then outline the relationships between atmospheric pressure and composition, the minimal mass of a photobioreactor&#8217;s outer walls (which is dependent on the inner-outer pressure difference), and growth rates. Relying on these relationships, we demonstrate that the structural mass of a photobioreactor can be decreased &#8211; without affecting cyanobacterial productivity &#8211; by reducing the inner gas pressure. We argue, however, that this reduction would be small next to the equivalent system mass of the cultivation system. A greater impact on resource-efficiency could come from the selection of atmospheric conditions which minimize gas processing requirements while adequately supporting cyanobacterial growth. The data and equations we provide can help identify these conditions.</description>

      <title>Research on the energy efficiency improvement of closed loop wastewater source heat pump with direct-expansion heat exchanger</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2298/tsci231223115l</link>
      <description>Yuanyuan Liu, Tiekun Jia, Wang Jing, Lijun Yang, Jun Zhao, Yirong Wang, Xidong Liang, Thermal science/Thermal Science. None(00)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396928695

                The closed-loop wastewater source heat exchanger (WSHE) has advantages such as being non-clogging and resistant to corrosion, but their heat transfer efficiency is relatively low, therefore it is still not the mainstream form of heat exchanger of wastewater source heat pump (WSHP). A novel CO2 direct-expansion wastewater source heat exchanger (DX-WSHE) is proposed in this paper, aiming to significantly improve the heat transfer rate of the heat exchanger and the energy efficiency of the heat pump system. The direct-expansion heat transfer process is complex, large grid number and long calculation time will be required if calculated by conventional numerical simulation software. Therefore, a three-dimensional transient heat transfer model was developed based on the thermal resistance and capacity model, which offers the advantages of fast computation speed and strong flexibility. The heat transfer and energy efficiency characteristics under different parameters were studied. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the direct-expansion wastewater source heat pump (DX-WSHP) can be increased by 31.0% compared to conventional design, and the heat flux of the direct-expansion wastewater source heat exchanger can be up to 250 W/m for the standard group. Compared with conventional designs, the direct-expansion wastewater source heat pump has excellent heat transfer and energy efficiency capabilities, which is a promising building energy saving and emission reduction technology.</description>

      <title>TECHNO-ECONOMIC VIABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESS- MENT STUDY OF SMALL-SCALE GRID-TIED ROOFTOP PV PLANT UNDER CHANGING WEATHER CONDITION</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26480/icpesd.03.2022.261.268</link>

                Land is a big issue in population dense country like India to implement large scale PV plant, whereas Grid-tied PV system is more economic than off- grid system in long run. The solar energy mission of the country will be success- ful if more and more small-scale rooftop plant will be developed. To address this issue and to find out different aspects of small-scale rooftop grid-tied PV plants, a 1kWp rooftop grid-tied PV plant is developed and different aspects of the plant on changed climate condition are studied. The study on the plant performance revealed that panel efficiency, inverter efficiency and overall system efficiency are 12.55%, 94.94% and 11.86% respectively. Array Yield, Reference Yield and final Yield of the plant are found to be 4.74,5.002 and 4.45 respectively. Also, authors analyzed capture loss, system loss and performance ratio are found to be 0.262,0.29 and 0.89 respectively. Reduction of the overall plant efficiency due to dust accumulation over the panels with changed climate condition is 0.6% for lower radiation levels and 1.6% for higher radiation levels after 4 consecutive non-cleaning days in Kolkata. Overall efficiency drops to 6.45% from 12.545% for continuous 60 non- cleaning days. From the environmental point of view the plant generates around 1149.75 kWh of electricity and fed to the grid which in turn reduces around 0.9 tons of CO2 to mix with the atmosphere annually. Apart from that the system has been compared with the simulation study in PV sol soft- ware and the production forecast, panel temperature and performance ratio has been carried out for annual basis. The payback period of the plant is evaluated as 11 years which is far less than the total life span of the plant which is 25 years. So, the results from the study sound positive for small scale grid-tied rooftop plants.</description>

      <title>Numerical-experimental investigation of a wind tower-room sustainable system: A parametric analysis of the mixed convection with humidification.</title>

                The wind tower is a sustainable architectural solution designed to improve natural ventilation and thermal comfort in buildings while reducing energy consumption. This study examines thermal comfort, natural ventilation, and heat transfer in a wind tower-room system with air humidification, such that the interaction of mixed convection with these parameters can be linked. The performance of the system is evaluated considering both natural and forced convection, influenced by differential heating and air inlet through the tower, respectively. A parametric analysis explores various parameters like outside air temperature, humidity, and velocity, along with room wall temperatures. Reynolds and Grashof numbers range from 8.57&#215;103-1.99&#215;105 and 2.20&#215;109-1.31&#215;1010, respectively. Simulations are validated against experimental data, with deviations under 5.0%, 10.0%, and 19.6% for dry-bulb temperature, wet-bulb temperature, and air velocity. The system shows improved heat extraction efficiency under dominant forced convection conditions. Humidification yields PPD values between 10.0% to 46.0% and PMV values below 0 at air temperatures range 25.0-30.0 &#176;C. At air temperatures of 35.0 &#176;C with air humidity below 40.0%, PPD values remain below 20.0%. However, above 40% humidity, humidification is less effective. The air exchange effectiveness reduction due to humidification is minimal at 0.61%. These results illustrate the combination of parameters necessary for the optimal performance of the tower-room system, this study provides a valuable guide for integrating wind towers with humidification systems in building design and contributing to reduced electricity use and CO2 emissions.</description>

      <title>A Life Cycle Assessment of Reusable and Disposable Surgical Caps</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2024.04.007</link>
      <description>Laura Donahue, Hayley J. Petit, Cassandra L. Thiel, Gwyneth A. Sullivan, Brian C. Gulack, Ami N. Shah, &#152;The &#156;Journal of surgical research/Journal of surgical research. 299(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396912277

                Introduction Surgical cap attire plays an important role in creating a safe and sterile environment in procedural suites, thus the choice of reusable versus disposable caps has become an issue of much debate. Given the lack of evidence for differences in surgical site infection (SSI) risk between the two, selecting the cap option with a lower carbon footprint may reduce the environmental impact of surgical procedures. However, many institutions continue to recommend the use of disposable bouffant caps. Methods ISO-14044 guidelines were used to complete a process-based life cycle assessment to compare the environmental impact of disposable bouffant caps and reusable cotton caps, specifically focusing on CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions, water use and health impacts. Results Reusable cotton caps reduced CO2e emissions by 79% when compared to disposable bouffant caps (10 kg versus 49 kg CO2e) under the base model scenario with a similar reduction seen in disability-adjusted life years. However, cotton caps were found to be more water intensive than bouffant caps (67.56 L versus 12.66 L) with the majority of water use secondary to production or manufacturing. Conclusions Reusable cotton caps have lower total lifetime CO2e emissions compared to disposable bouffant caps across multiple use scenarios. Given the lack of evidence suggesting a superior choice for surgical site infection prevention, guidelines should recommend reusable cotton caps to reduce the environmental impact of surgical procedures.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficiency Management in China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-51532-3_4</link>
      <description>Alexey Mikhaylov, Contributions to management science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396876663

                At the current stage of economic development, environmental factors have become crucial in improving the energy efficiency of production. This includes environmental protection, controlling harmful emissions from fuel combustion, energy produced per unit of CO2 released, and managing industrial waste. These indicators, although may seem like restrictions, actually stimulate the implementation of measures to improve energy conservation. Developing an energy strategy for an enterprise is a complex process that requires considering several factors and reviewing them periodically in connection with new technological advancements and competitor initiatives. Without such a strategy, a company cannot create a clear and precise program to improve energy efficiency, which is essential to be a competitive production today. However, it is worth noting that developing an energy efficiency program for a production complex is particularly challenging. It is because optimizing the energy efficiency of individual components alone cannot ensure the overall energy efficiency of the complex as it is a complex socioeconomic system. To maintain competitiveness, the enterprise should reduce its costs, which can be achieved through energy efficiency and energy-saving programs based on a cost leadership strategy. This strategy involves reducing product prices by reducing costs (including energy costs) to attract more consumers, resulting in increased profit volumes. Alternatively, the enterprise can reduce costs (including energy) without reducing product prices while maintaining market share, resulting in increased profit from the sale of each unit of production. A cost reduction strategy to improve energy efficiency and save energy should consider the existence of such costs in almost all parts of the company's value chain, with the scale of production being the most important.</description>

      <title>IAA induced biomass and lipid overproduction in microalga via two-stage cultivation strategy: Characterization using FTIR/CHNS/TGA/DTG and 1H- NMR for bioenergy potential</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2024.118546</link>
      <description>S. R. Singh, Amit Kant Singh, Sakshi Singh, N. B. L. Prasad, Laxmi Laxmi, Prabhakar Singh, Prabhakar Singh, Energy conversion and management. 311(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396943576

                Microalgae are an excellent carbon concentrators with substantial lipid content. However, biomass production vis-&#224;-vis lipid hyperaccumulation is a major constraint in the biofuel economy. In this regard, Dunaliella salina, an oleaginous, wall less microalga, was grown in graded concentration of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). There was a significant increase in biomass (1.57-fold), photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm = 0.72), and chlorophyll a content in 0.25 mg/L IAA supplemented cultures over the control (stage I). However, supplementation of IAA under nitrogen deprivation (stage II) led to a significant rise in the lipid content (47 % DCW), carbohydrate (18.37 %) and simultaneous reduction in the oxidative status (MDA, H2O2, O2&#183;&#8722;, OH&#183;) over the control. Further, 0.25 mg/L IAA supplemented cultures under nitrogen starvation were undertaken for biomass and lipid characterization. Nile red based flow cytometric analysis revealed an apparent increase in the neutral lipid fluorescence, also validated by 1H- NMR based lipidome, revealing the presence of triacylglycerol (TAG, 4.12&#8211;4.31 ppm). FTIR spectra revealed the increased absorbance at 2926 cm&#8722;1, 1740 cm&#8722;1 and 1025 cm&#8722;1, validating the increased carbohydrate and lipid, while biomass pyrolysis showed 81.42 % decomposition in the active pyrolytic zone as recorded by the TGA/DTG analysis. Interestingly, elemental analysis (CHNS) of the biomass showed an increased carbon and hydrogen %, HHV (19.94 MJ kg&#8722;1), H/C ratio (1.78), and CO2 fixation rate. Thus, the present study opens new avenues for the economic feasibility of bioenergy/biofuel production from microalgal biomass at commercial scale.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Spatial and Temporal Variations in N2O Emissions from Dairy Manure Management in China Based on IPCC Methodology</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14050753</link>
      <description>Bin Hu, Lijie Zhang, Chao Liang, Xiaoshan Yang, Zhaoyong Shi, Chaoyuan Wang, Agriculture. 14(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396888431

                The emission factor method (Tier 1) recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is commonly used to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock and poultry farms. However, the estimation accuracy may vary due to practical differences in manure management across China. The objectives of this study were to estimate the direct and indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from dairy manure management between 1990 and 2021 in China and characterize its spatial and temporal variations following IPCC guideline Tier 2. The N2O emission factor (EF) of dairy cow manure management systems was determined at the national level and regional level as well. The results showed that the national cumulative N2O emission of manure management from 1990 to 2021 was 113.1million tons of CO2 equivalent, ranging from 90.3 to 135.9 million tons with an uncertainty of &#177;20.2%. The annual EF was 0.021 kg N2O-N (kg N)&#8722;1 for total emissions, while it was 0.014 kg N2O-N (kg N)&#8722;1 for direct emissions. The proportions of N2O emissions in North China, Northeast China, East China, Central and Southern China, Southwest China and Northwest China were 32.3%, 18.6%, 11.4%, 5.8%, 6.1% and 25.8%, respectively. In addition, N2O emissions varied among farms in different scales. The respective proportions of total N2O emissions from small-scale and large-scale farms were 64.8% and 35.2% in the past three decades. With the improvement in farm management and milk production efficiency, the N2O emissions per unit mass of milk decreased from 0.77 &#215; 10&#8722;3 kg to 0.48 &#215; 10&#8722;3 kg in 1990&#8211;2021. This study may provide important insights into compiling a GHG emission inventory and developing GHG emission reduction strategies for the dairy farming system in China.</description>

                Boosting solutions such as turbochargers are one of the popular technologies in the development of IC engines. Turbochargers date back to their usage on aircraft engines in the early nineteenth century and started usage in heavy-duty Caterpillar engines in 1954. Later they were introduced in passenger car applications in the early 1960s and became more popular after the 1990s due to the usage of high-power density engines in passenger cars. Popular technologies in engine air management systems such as variable valve timing (VVT), supercharging, turbocharging and intercooling have significantly improved engine power-to-weight and power-to-displacement ratios. Turbocharging internal combustion engine is widely recognized as one of the best and most cost-effective technologies for the enhanced benefits in power density, low-end torque, fuel consumption (CO2 emissions), transient performance etc. Basis the benefits of fuel efficiency from turbocharging, it is considered as one of the key technologies to adopt for CAFE standards (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) with downsized engines. Globally turbocharging has gained popularity and higher penetration year on year in diesel, gasoline, and bi-fuel /Natural gas engine types. The boosting system has been undergoing upgradation with various add-on features to meet performance and emission needs. The introduction of emission norms like RDE (Real Driving Emission) drives engines to optimise for a reduction in scavenging, maintain &#955; = 1 in full operations and usage of the gas particulate filter to meet the Particulate number (PN) limit. In gasoline engines, there is a need to incorporate advanced combustion technologies like Miller/Atkinson and Low-Pressure Exhaust Gas Recirculation (LPEGR), with lean burn combustion for improved fuel economy. In this chapter, the benefits and challenges of the turbocharger boosting system and its integration into the gasoline engine are described. Additionally, the simpler ways of modelling the engine air management system to help the selection of the right boosting solutions are described.</description>

                Solar-based home PV systems are the most amazing eco-friendly energy innovations in the world, which are not only climate-friendly but also cost-effective solutions. The tropical environment of Malaysia makes it difficult to adopt photovoltaic (PV) systems because of the protracted rainy monsoon season, which makes PV systems useless without backup batteries. Large quantities of lithium-ion battery (LIB) trash are being produced by the electric vehicle (EV) sector. A total of 75% of the highest capacity levels have been discarded. By 2035, it is predicted that the wasted LIBs held as a result of expensive recycling and difficult material separation would carry up to 1200 GWh. An economical and sustainable option is offered by our study, which prototypes a replicated LIB pack that is incorporated into a PV home system. This study investigates the transformational power of second-life electric vehicle batteries (SLEVBs) when incorporated into home photovoltaic (PV) systems. The concept entails reusing existing electric vehicle batteries for stationary applications, offering a unique approach to extending the life of these batteries while meeting the growing need for sustainable domestic energy storage. The study looks at the technological feasibility, economic viability, and environmental effect of introducing SLEVBs into household PV systems, giving vital insight into their role in revolutionizing energy storage techniques and promoting sustainability. In comparison to the Lead&#8211;Acid Battery (LAB) system, the SLEVB system has a cheaper total cost of ownership, with savings of 12.62% compared with new LABs. A CO2 emission reduction of at least 20% is achieved by using the SLEVB system compared with LABs. Electricity can be provided in houses in rural areas where there is no electricity. As a result, the security and superiority of the life of rural residents will improve. It is anticipated that the suggested strategy will lower EV pricing, enabling EV adoption for M40 and B40 groups. Consequently, the Malaysian and worldwide EV business will remain viable.</description>

                In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the capacity to generate energy faces significant hurdles. Despite efforts to integrate renewable energy sources and natural gas power plants into the energy portfolio, the desired reduction in environmental impact and alleviation of energy poverty remain elusive. Hence, exploring a spectrum of hybrid technologies, encompassing storage and hydrogen-based solutions, is imperative to optimize energy production while mitigating harmful emissions. To exemplify this necessity, the 216 MW Kribi gas power plant in Cameroon is the case study. The primary aim is to investigate cutting-edge emissions and energy schemes within the SSA. This paper assessed the minimum complaint load technique and four power-to-fuel options from technical, financial, and environmental perspectives to assess the viability of a natural gas fuel system powered with hydrogen in a hybrid mode. The system generates hydrogen by using water electrolysis, with photovoltaic electricity and gas power plant. This research also assesses process efficiency, storage capacity, annual costs, carbon avoided costs, and production prices for various fuels. Results showed that the LCOE from a photovoltaic solar plant is 0.19$/kWh, with the Power-to-Hydrogen process (76.2% efficiency) being the most efficient, followed by the ammonia and urea processes. The study gives a detailed examination of the hybrid hydrogen natural gas fuel system. According to the annual cost breakdown, the primary costs are associated with the acquisition of electrical energy and electrolyser CAPEX and OPEX, which account for 95% of total costs. Urea is the cheapest mass fuel. However, it costs more in terms of energy. Hydrogen is the most cost-effective source of energy. In terms of energy storage and energy density by volume, the methane resulted as the most suitable solution, while the ammonia resulted as the best H2 storage medium in terms of kg of H2 per m3 of storage (108 kgH2/m3). By substituting the fuel system with 15% H2, the environmental effects are reduced by 1622 tons per year, while carbon capture technology gathered 16,664 tons of CO2 for methanation and urea operations, yielding a total carbon averted cost of 21 $/ton.</description>

      <title>DiagNet-A Hybrid Physics-Data Driven Model for Fractured Reservoir Simulation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/219110-ms</link>

                Abstract Fractured reservoir simulation is important and applicable to understand many processes related to subsurface geo-energy recovery and storage, such as shale gas/oil, enhanced geothermal systems, and CO2 sequestration in basaltic rocks. However, such simulations are often computationally expensive to capture the high contrast of permeability and pore volume between matrix and fracture. Therefore, a reduced order model (ROM) can be extremely beneficial for fractured reservoir simulation to reduce computational costs for iterative history-matching and reservoir optimization workflows. In this study, we propose a novel ROM that flexibly honors fracture representations, namely DiagNet. In DiagNet, we generate the coarse matrix nodes based on the reservoir outlines, and add extra diagonal connections between non-neighboring matrix nodes if intersecting fractures traverse them, which avoids the inclusion of additional fracture nodes. Since dimensionality reduction methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can facilitate the model parameterization, we adopt PCA to generate quality priors for sampling of the matrix transmissibility and pore volume arrays. Further, the DiagNet models are then calibrated to the well observation data (such as well flow rates and bottom-hole pressures), and a gradient-based optimization method is implemented in a general automatic-differentiable simulator framework to tune the model parameters (e.g., matrix/fracture transmissibilities, pore volumes, and well indices). Our results show that we can perform robust calibration of DiagNet based on the synthetic well observation data from a fine-scale reference simulation model. We have found that it is necessary to incorporate the dominant flow physics (i.e., water breakthrough) from the observation data to improve the training convergence and the prediction accuracy for DiagNet. Further, PCA for parameterization improves the convergence rate of model calibration, as compared to random initialization. Interpretation of the calibrated transmissibility field from DiagNet aligns with high connectivity regions from the fine-scale reference model. As a result, the new DiagNet is interpretable in terms of reservoir connectivity or geology and thus can be used for reservoir history-matching using observation data from the field and the further optimization.</description>
