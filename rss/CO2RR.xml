                Carbon dioxide (CO2) electroreduction provides a sustainable route for realizing carbon neutrality and energy supply. Up to now, challenges remain in employing abundant and inexpensive nickel materials as candidates for CO2 reduction due to their low activity and favorable hydrogen evolution. Here, the representative iron-modified nickel nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (Ni1-Fe0.125-NC) with the porous botryoid morphology were successfully developed. Hexamethylenetetramine is used as nitrogen-doped carbon source. The collaboration of internal lattice expansion with electron effect and external confinement effect with size effect endows the significant enhancement in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The optimized Ni1-Fe0.125-NC exhibits broad potential ranges for continuous carbon monoxide (CO) production. A superb CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 85.0 % realized at &#8722;1.1 V maintains a longtime durability over 35 h, which exceeds many state-of-the-art metal catalysts. Theoretical calculations further confirm that electron redistribution promotes the desorption of CO in the process for favorable CO production. This work opens a new avenue to design efficient nickel-based materials by considering the intrinsic structure and external confinement for CO2 reduction.</description>

                This study explores the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) using tin (Sn) and zinc (Zn) catalyst-loaded gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs). The research explores the influence of electrolytic potential and catalyst loading on the efficiency of CO2 conversion to valuable chemicals, specifically formic acid and carbon monoxide. The best Sn loading for Sn-loaded GDEs, according to the morphological study, is 7 mg.cm-2, which results in higher current density (0.33 mA.cm-2) and current efficiency (36%). An electrolytic potential of -1.3 V Vs. Ag/AgCl is identified as optimal for Sn GDEs, offering a balance between high current efficiency (35%) and controlled current density. For Zn-loaded GDEs, an optimal loading of 5 mg.cm&#178;- yields the highest current efficiency of 19.4% and a peak current density of 0.28 mA.cm&#178;- at an electrolytic potential of -1.55 V Vs. Ag/AgCl, in addition to highlighting the crucial role that catalyst loading and electrolytic potential play in enhancing CO2 reduction efficiency, this research offers insightful information for environmentally friendly CO2 conversion technology.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Accumulation and Stability Enhancement Effects Triggered by Built&#8208;in Electric Field of SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/LaOCl Nanofibers Boost Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202402654</link>

                Abstract Constructing a built&#8208;in interfacial electric field (BIEF) is an effective approach to enhance the electrocatalysts performance, but it has been rarely demonstrated for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) to date. Herein, for the first time, SnO 2 /LaOCl nanofibers (NFs) with BIEF is created by electrospinning, exhibiting a high Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 100% C 1 product (CO and HCOOH) at &#8722;0.9&#8211;&#8722;1.1 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a maximum FE HCOOH of 90.1% at &#8722;1.2 V RHE in H&#8208;cell, superior to the commercial SnO 2 nanoparticles (NPs) and LaOCl NFs. SnO 2 /LaOCl NFs also exhibit outstanding stability, maintaining negligible activity degradation even after 10 h of electrolysis. Moreover, their current density and FE HCOOH are almost 400 mA cm &#8722;2 at &#8722;2.31 V and 83.4% in flow&#8208;cell. The satisfactory CO 2 RR performance of SnO 2 /LaOCl NFs with BIEF can be ascribed to tight interface of coupling SnO 2 NPs and LaOCl NFs, which can induce charge redistribution, rich active sites, enhanced CO 2 adsorption, as well as optimized Gibbs free energy of *OCHO. The work reveals that the BIEF will trigger interfacial accumulation and stability enhancement effects in promoting CO 2 RR activity and stability of SnO 2 &#8208;based materials, providing a novel approach to develop stable and efficient CO 2 RR electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking microwave-induced CO2 plasma splitting against electrochemical CO2 reduction for a comparison of promising technologies</title>

      <description>A. Hecimovic, Matthew T. Mayer, L.G.J. de Haart, S. K. Gupta, C. Kiefer, Alexander Navarrete, Andreas Schulz, U. Fantz, Journal of CO2 utilization. 83(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399217262

                Plasma conversion technology is an emerging technique under development to activate, convert or valorize gas molecules such as CO2, N2, CH4, NH3 and others. A large-scale application beyond the lab-scale demonstrator unit requires assessment of the efficiency of this new technology. The straightforward approach for assessment of the efficiency is benchmarking with the other well-established technologies of similar technology readiness level (TRL). In this paper we present a benchmarking of the atmospheric pressure microwave-induced CO2 plasma splitting with electrochemical CO2 conversion, via both low-temperature and high-temperature electrolysis. An additional step of oxygen removal in case of the plasma reactor is implemented due to the difference in the output stream of the plasma (gas mixture containing CO2, CO, and O2) and the electrochemical reactor (typical gas mixture on cathode containing CO2 and CO). For the benchmarking, a comprehensive set of comparison parameters that are applicable for both the plasma and the electrochemical route is identified and grouped in three comparison categories: performance, interfaces, and economics. The comparison of these parameters demonstrates that in terms of the electric power consumption (EPC; power required for production of one Nm3CO) plasma conversion technology (&#8764;20 kWh/Nm3CO) is in the ballpark with the other two electrochemical technologies (&#8764;4&#8211;20 kWh/Nm3CO). The key features of the plasma conversion technology are relatively large conversion (up to 56%) and moderate energy efficiencies (up to 27%). Also, CO2 gas of reduced purity of only 98% can be used without decrease of the performance, and CO output values are currently at 3.5 slm (standard litre per minute). Fast on/off response time of order of minutes, and no need for the hot standby indicate that the plasma conversion is particularly suitable for use of intermittent renewable energy sources. The aspects that require further development include optimization of the process towards lower EPCtotal values, improved oxygen gas separation, and reliable ignition of the plasma.</description>

                The development of highly efficient catalysts for the selective electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (eCO2RR) to high-valued formate remains a challenge in achieving carbon neutrality and renewable energy conversion. In this study, ultrathin Bi4Cl2S5 nanowires, synthesized using different branched-chain thiols as sulfur sources, were reported for the first time as precatalysts for eCO2RR to formate. Systematic material characterization demonstrated that Bi4Cl2S5 can undergo in-situ evolution into Bi2O2CO3 nanowires, serving as the genuine electrocatalyst for eCO2RR. Through the fine-tuning of ligands during the synthesis of Bi4Cl2S5 nanowires, the optimized Bi4Cl2S5-derived Bi2O2CO3 nanowires exhibited a maximum formate Faradaic efficiency (FEformate) of 95.3 % in eCO2RR using a traditional H-cell, surpassing other prepared samples. Furthermore, an FEformate of over 92.9 % was achieved in a wide potential window of 500 mV, and high performance was maintained over 20 h. This outstanding performance is attributed to the high intrinsic activity, accelerated charge transfer, and the large electrochemical active surface area associated with the characteristic sub-10 nm diameter nanowire structure. Moreover, density function theory calculations further revealed that Bi2O2CO3 can reduce the energy barriers for the formation of *OCHO intermediate and bolster formate production. Our work provides a novel synthesis strategy for excellent Bi-based catalysts in electrocatalysis.</description>

                The photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction is severely limited by sluggish charge kinetics. To address this issue, a strategy utilizing non-metal-doped layered double hydroxide (LDH) has been developed to control the electronic structure of spindle-shaped nanoflowers, resulting in efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The results demonstrate that the designed catalyst yields 263.16 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for the photoreduction of CO2 to CO. Furthermore, the in situ FT-IR analysis demonstrate that the specific S-ligand (S-bridge) facilitates CO2 activation, ensuring the continuous production of *COOH. The hydrothermal-assisted ionic liquid method proposed in this study offers guidance for modifying catalysts.</description>

                Engine downsizing is considered a strategic idea in fuel economy enhancement as well as reduction. It is defined in the literature as the decrease in engine geometrical dimensions besides its performance being fixed. In this research, the Iranian gasoline-fueled national engine, EF7, has been investigated for 25% downsizing. After introducing the gasoline-fueled and CNG-fueled versions of downsized engines, their performance, besides release rates are studied in detail. A one-dimensional engine simulator coupled with a 3D-CFD model is developed to carry out such an investigation, an experimental test setup is provided to evaluate the accuracy of the provided numerical model, as well. The first version of presented downsized engines, called EF7, is a 3-cylinder engine with the same geometrical characteristics as the base engine, which is equipped with a turbo-charger and dual CVVT technologies. The EF7 is then introduced by fuel shifting to CNG as the second version of downsized engines, and finally, increasing the compression ratio, the EF7 is presented as the third version of studied-downsized engines. The results show almost the same rate of BSFC besides a 3.4% reduction in concentration for EF7, 20.6% fuel economy enhancement, besides 20.8% reduction in the specific release rate for EF7, and 28.8% fuel economy enhancement, besides 25.3% reduction in the specific release rate for EF7 in comparison with the base engine.</description>

      <title>Tunable syngas generation by metal-free B, N co-doping nanolayered carbon via CO2 reduction reaction</title>

                Syngas generation by cost-effective carbons through CO2 reduction reaction contributes greatly to environmental CO2 mitigation. Herein, a series of B, N co-doping nanolayered carbon (BN-NLC) electrocatalysts are developed by molten-salt pyrolysis. The results show that, the products of CO2 electroreduction on as-prepared BN-NLC are CO and H2 with no liquid phase product. And the optimal BN-NLC (900 &#176;C, n(C6H5)4BNa : nmelamine =1:200) exhibits high selectivity (the faradaic efficiency of CO and H2 is 83.45 % and 16.54 %, respectively) with the syngas ratio from 0.2 to 3.2 (H2 / CO), easily regulated by controlling the applied potential during the CO2 reduction process. This study would provide a good option for the electrochemical CO2 reduction to produce tunable syngas feedstock for numerous downstream processes (e.g. Fischer-Tropsch process and hydroformylation of alkenes to aldehydes).</description>

      <title>Towards Practical CO2 Storage Capacity in Dutch Depleted Gas Fields: Reservoir Quality and Regulatory Limits Reductions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3997/2214-4609.2024101586</link>
      <description>J. Bijkerk, M. Blasweiler, C&#237;ntia Machado, T. Ravestein, Jon Limberger, Rory Dalman, G. Remmelts, J.N. Breunese, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399186063

                Summary CO2 storage capacity is limited in the Netherlands and high demand from emitters makes it essential to determine a practical capacity. Especially if neighbouring countries with even lower storage capacity such as Belgium and Germany will export significant CO2 volumes to fulfil their industrial abatement requirements. Previous work calculated a theoretical capacity for depleted gas fields from a simple gas replacement-pressure relationship. Practical capacity was then derived from a generic discount factor. Aquifer storage potential in the Netherlands was assumed limited but is currently being revaluated. This study shows a significant improvement by analysing the interaction of intrinsic geological properties and potential regulatory choices. Regulatory requirements to mitigate leakage risk by defining strict pressure limits for depleted gas field stores are not yet defined, but could have a strong effect. Hydrostatically limiting the bottom hole pressure is shown to severely reduce the capacity, especially on poorer quality fields and is largely related to pressure build-up around injection wells in these fields. Combined with additional economic limitations, more than 40% of the gas-replaced capacity is lost from the overall portfolio. Given the large effect, the necessity of these risk mitigation measures needs to be further assessed.</description>

                Using photoelectrochemical technology to construct efficient photoelectric materials has aroused extensive research interest. In this study, we propose a two-dimensional porous CuSe@BiOI isotype heterojunction photocathode for CO2 reduction to formic acid. The heterojunction was constructed by the epitaxial growth of high-quality oriented BiOI nanosheets onto the porous CuSe framework. The CuSe framework as a template to ensure the formation of the (1 0 2) facets of BiOI and the isotropic charge transport characteristics of the (1 0 2) surface greatly improve the efficiency of charge separation and transfer. This CuSe@BiOI isotype heterojunction electrode can efficiently reduce CO2 to formic acid with a selectivity of up to 80.5 % in 0.5 M potassium bicarbonate aqueous solution. Meanwhile, the performance of the photodetector based on CuSe@BiOI heterostructure is 6.97 &#215; 1011 Jones and a response rate of 87.13 mA W&#8722;1. This finding provides a new approach to designing stable heterojunction photoelectrocatalysts with isotropy</description>

                Abstract Climate change mitigation through negative CO 2 emissions has been recognized as a crucial strategy to combat global warming. However, its potential effects on terrestrial productivity and agricultural activities remain uncertain. In this study, we utilized large ensemble simulations with an Earth system model of full complexity to investigate the response of Gross Primary Production (GPP) to CO 2 forcings. Our findings reveal a significant asymmetry in the GPP response to CO 2 ramp-up and symmetric ramp-down model experiments, especially in Europe, suggesting that GPP declines rapidly as CO 2 levels decrease. Remarkably, during the CO 2 removal period, the North Atlantic Sea surface temperature experienced cooling due to a delayed recovery of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). This cooling led to precipitation and soil moisture deficits, resulting in a rapid reduction in GPP. This asymmetry in GPP response holds consistent across multi-model simulations. These results underscore the potential implications of delayed recovery in ocean circulation, which could unexpectedly accelerate terrestrial GPP reduction. These insights are crucial for policymakers, aiding them in projecting agricultural activity and formulating targeted GPP control policies specific to the European region.</description>

                Summary This research investigates the feasibility of using Redcar Mudstone formation in the UK for carbon dioxide sequestration through mineral carbonation and enhanced weathering. Given the urgency of reducing atmospheric CO2 levels, it is essential to explore carbon dioxide removal methods such as mineral carbonation and enhanced weathering. These methods aim to accelerate natural CO2 reducing reactions involving alkaline minerals, potentially leading to the formation of stable carbonate minerals that can securely sequester CO2. The study conducted various experiments under different conditions, including high-pressure/temperature experiment, column experiment and CO2 incubator experiments. The results demonstrated that high pressure/temperature conditions were particularly effective for mineral carbonation, with the formation of stable calcite indicative of successful CO2 capture. The pH levels decreased across all experiments, confirming the acidification of the system and promoting further reactions with CO2. The research suggests that RM, with its abundant clay minerals, can be a suitable medium for CO2 sequestration through both mineral carbonation and enhanced weathering. RM's potential reactivity and scalability make it a promising candidate for carbon capture technologies, offering a passive and continuous approach for CO2 reduction.</description>

                In recent years, boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes have attained great significance and emerged as outstanding potential candidates for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion to valuable products. The features like chemical stability, abundant economical raw material, and long cyclic stability of BDD electrodes made them highly competitive as compared to the conventional metal-based electrodes. However, the direction of research approach is not focused and not adequate for improvement in the design, yield, and selectivity. Most of the countries have targeted the achievement of "net zero", i.e., utmost removal of CO2 from the atmosphere that has been emitted by human activities within the next decade. In this context, we have reviewed electrochemical CO2 reduction using a diamond electrode. In this mini-review, we used the curated literature available in the CAS content collection to present a systematic analysis of the various approaches applied by scientists on recent developments on BDD electrodes for electrochemical reduction of CO2. More significantly, we wisely addressed the challenges and future perspectives to improve the yield and selectivity of CO2 reduction products as a direction to researchers in this field. Multiple strategies have been discussed allied to tackle the high overpotential and low carbon monoxide yield issues. The review highlights the current status and developments with focus on understanding the reaction mechanisms, impact of dopant concentration on performance, improved electrolyte designs, surface characteristics, choice of electrolytes, and challenges such as low yield and unsatisfactory selectivity of BDD based CO2 electroreduction. Our analysis highlights the latest trends alongside the associated challenges with BDD based CO2 electroreduction and future direction for researchers.</description>

      <title>Sustainability in Vietnam: Examining Economic Growth, Energy, Innovation, Agriculture, and Forests' Impact on CO2 Emissions</title>

                Global warming, induced by human-generated greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO2), threatens the planet's ecology, economic development, and long-term viability in unparalleled ways. Vietnam's utilization of energy and CO2 emanations are on the increase as a consequence of the country's increasing economic and improving agricultural practices. Governments seeking to accomplish an equilibrium between combating climate change and sustainable development would benefit from a deeper understanding of Vietnam's climate change vulnerability. A better understanding of the trade-off between pollution and economic growth is crucial if Vietnam is to slow the rate at which its environment is being damaged. So, the current study empirically examined the connections between GDP development, energy consumption, technical advancement, agricultural output, forest region, and carbon dioxide emissions in Vietnam. This study collected annual data from 1990 to 2020 and analyzed it using the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares method. Based on the projection, Vietnam experiences a direct correlation between energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This implies that an increase in energy consumption and economic growth corresponds to a corresponding emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that this pattern might be alleviated by means of technological innovations, increased agricultural output, and initiatives to broaden forested regions. A negative correlation exists between these variables and CO2 emissions; technological innovations, more sustainable agricultural methods, and forest preservation initiatives may contribute to the gradual reduction of CO2 emissions. Therefore, environmental sustainability could be achieved through reduced emissions if the policies advocated in this article were implemented. Some of these policies include using renewable energy sources, encouraging innovations in technology, encouraging climate-conscious agriculture, and encouraging careful forest management.</description>

      <title>Ecoefficient Cementitious Materials with High Levels of Portland Cement Replacement Using Blast Furnace Slag</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1061/jmcee7.mteng-17320</link>
      <description>Arlindo Gon&#231;alves, Eduardo Inocente Jussiani, Avacir Casanova Andrello, Romel Dias Vanderlei, Berenice Martins Toralles, Journal of materials in civil engineering. 36(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399160643

                The portland cement (PC) industry is responsible for approximately 7% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the world. Blast furnace slag (BFS) has been increasingly used as a substitute for PC, due to the efficient disposal of steel industry waste and reductions in CO2 emissions. The present work investigated the environmental benefits of cementitious materials with large volumes of BFS (up to 90% PC replacement for the S90 mixture) and the influence on porosity and compressive strength. By X-ray computed microtomography and mercury intrusion porosimetry, pore size distribution was assessed. Porosity was also evaluated by water absorption. The environmental impacts were investigated by analyzing the embodied CO2 emissions (ECO2) and embodied energy (EE) by using life cycle assessment methodology. Reductions of around 40% in the compressive strength of S90 were found, while reductions in EE and ECO2 were above 80%. The S90 showed higher porosity at the age of 28 days, but then promoted a more active pore closing effect over time, being nevertheless feasible for use in terms of porosity. The use of S90 is expected to increase durability due to its thinner porous matrix, and contribute to reducing environmental impact and advancing cleaner production.</description>

      <title>Development of Technology and a Convert&#1077;r for Neutralizing Greenhouse Gases Emitted from Automobiles</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54338/27382656-2024.6-001</link>

                The article touches upon the issues of global warming associated with carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions into the atmosphere from vehicle internal combustion engines (ICE). To neutralize existing greenhouse gases emitted by ICE, in particular CO2, the interaction of the latter with various chemicals has been studied. The dynamics of exhaust gas emissions from ICE cylinders were observed. The experimental research was conducted to develop a greenhouse gas neutralization technology. Carbon dioxide neutralization converter with three neutralization batteries and a homogenization device is presented. This converter can guarantee CO2 neutralization of up to 92%. The formation of CO2 in the cylinders of modern petrol engines is due to the final combustion of the air-petrol fuel mixture. The combustion of the latter in the cylinder can be heterogeneous and diffusive. In addition, CO2 is generated in large quantities during diffusion combustion. The most effective method of diffusive combustion was chosen by the constructors of modern ICE, which is the formation of an artificial turbulent gas-dynamic condition for the fuel mixture due to the increase in the temperature of the air adsorbed in the cylinder, which ensures the engine's thermal energy efficiency coefficient of up to 35%. The CO2 volume in the exhaust gases of such engines reaches up to 16%. Thus, considering the perfection of modern ICE design for providing a high-efficiency reaction for the hydrocarbon oxidation in the fuel mixture in the combustion chamber, it becomes apparent that the presence of about 16% CO2 in the fractional composition of emitted dissolved gases is a serious problem in terms of increasing the volume of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Therefore, the goal of this article is to develop a reduction technology.</description>

      <title>Techno-economic Analysis of Water-based CO2 Capture Method Based on Adiabatic Compressed Air Energy Storage: Comparison with Monoethanolamine-based CO2 Capture Method</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142790</link>

                Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage is considered an effective measure to mitigate climate change, used to reduce CO2 emissions from industrial sectors, especially for coal-fired power plants. In our previous work, a novel water-based CO2 capture (WCC) method based on adiabatic compressed air energy storage (A-CAES) was developed. This method is simple and environmentally friendly. However, unlike the widely used monoethanolamine (MEA)-based CO2 capture (MCC) technology, which consumes low-grade thermal energy, the WCC technology consumes high-grade electrical energy. Therefore, in this work, a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of the WCC technology is conducted and compared with the MCC technology from the perspective of carbon emission reduction. A universal economic assessment criterion of CO2 capture cost based on electricity prices is proposed, and the techno-economic analysis is based on the cost in 2022 USD ($). The result shows that the CO2 capture cost of the WCC system ranges from 53.74 to 71.70 $/tonne CO2 due to the different factors considered in computational models, taking 63.57%&#8764;84.81% of the MCC system under the same capture rate (85%). The dynamic payback period of the WCC system ranges from 7.14 years to 20.52 years, while the MCC system failed to recover capital throughout the entire lifecycle. Moreover, the CO2 capture cost of the WCC system can be reduced to below carbon tax (43 $/tonne CO2) when the CO2 concentration in the feed flue gas is above 18 vol%, achieving positive benefits with no carbon trading required, which means the WCC system can achieve positive profitability for higher CO2 concentration emission sectors. The results provide significant guidance for developing and promoting the WCC technology.</description>

                Monoethanolamine (MEA)-based carbon dioxide absorption is one of the effective carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies but is significantly restricted by the high energy consumption in the regeneration of rich amine solution. Solid acid catalysts have the potential to reduce energy consumption, while the exploration of highly active catalysts with abundant Bro&#823;nsted and Lewis acid sites remains needing. We developed an efficient solid acid catalyst, niobium-modified HZSM-5 (Nb/HZ), to facilitate CO2 desorption from the CO2-captured MEA solutions. The Nb/HZ catalysts with various niobium loadings were synthesized by using an impregnation method. HZSM-5 retained its pore structure and large surface area after niobium incorporation. The catalyst with 4% Nb (4.0-Nb/HZ) has the highest activity and stability, with 61% increase in the desorption rate, 50% increase in the desorbed CO2 amount, and 37% reduction of relative heat duty. According to theoretic calculations and experimental analyses, the Nb/HZ catalyst provides abundant Bro&#823;nsted and Lewis acid sites to facilitate carbamate adsorption, proton transfer, and carbamate breakdown, thus reducing the activation energy for CO2 desorption. This work provides a valuable solid acid catalyst for amine-based CO2 capture and also brings insights for the development of a novel solid acid for diverse catalysis.</description>

                The motivation behind the advancement of novel technologies for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) originates from the increasing energy demand and imperative to explore new oil reserves. Novel approaches, including the injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) and sequestration of CO2 in oil reservoirs, have emerged as potential remedies. In response to the rising apprehensions regarding global warming attributed to anthropogenic activities and the consequent rise in CO2 emissions, scholars are directing their attention toward the utilization of CO2 sequestration methods for EOR. This methodology presents an achievable strategy to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions and diminish their influence on the atmosphere. The implementation of CO2 sequestration in EOR operations has the potential to yield the dual benefits of cost reduction and additional oil recovery. The paper presents a study that investigates distinct scenarios of CO2 injection and sequestration in various formations. The study incorporates conventional methodologies, such as gas injection, for the purpose of EOR. It explores diverse fields of CO2 injection and sequestration, deliberates on the decision-making process concerning injection strategies, and employs dynamic as well as static models to generate long-term production profiles, evaluate production profiles, and manage the process. The paper explores the challenges encountered by various industries in the process of capturing, transporting, and storing of CO2 in geological formations. Additionally, the study assesses the geological potential and practicality of implementing this methodology in India. In brief, this study presents a thorough examination of Indian scenarios for CO2 injection and sequestration utilized in EOR techniques.</description>

      <title>Novel wastewater recovery process for sustainable sodium carbonate production with CO2 and SOx utilization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcou.2024.102824</link>
      <description>Jongmin Choi, Jonghun Lim, Yurim Kim, Seongbin Ga, Junghwan Kim, Journal of CO2 utilization. 83(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399239965

                Ammonia-soda process, which produce soda ash, emits flue gas containing a large amount of CO2 and SOx. The wastewater discharged from the ammonia-soda process contains cations, such as Na+ and Ca2+, which can be recovered and reacted with a CO2 and SOx. In this study, we designed a CO2 and SOx utilization process for the sustainable production of sodium carbonate using wastewater recovery system, extracting Na+ and Ca2+. The proposed process involved the following steps: (1) metal-ion separation, which produces NaOH and Ca(OH)2; (2) capture and utilization of SOx using Ca(OH)2; and (3) capture and utilization of CO2 using NaOH and Ca(OH)2, respectively. The economic feasibility of the proposed process was verified by comparing its total annualized cost (TAC) with those of conventional processes. Approximately 99% of SOx was captured to produce high-purity desulfurized gypsum, and 99% of CO2 was captured to be transformed into CaCO3. To confirm the CO2 reduction of the process, the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) was calculated by evaluating the amount of greenhouse gases. The CO2e decreased to 71.4% compared with that of the conventional process. The TAC of the proposed process decreased by 10.67% and 19.63% compared with that of the ammonia-soda and Hou processes, respectively. Thus, this study proposes an industrially potential process design for sustainable sodium carbonate production by utilizing CO2 and SOx with wastewater recycling, without additional reactants, making it more economically viable.</description>

      <title>Experimental Research on Regulated and Unregulated Emissions from E20-Fuelled Vehicles and Hybrid Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos15060669</link>
      <description>Tao Qiu, Yaohua Zhao, Yan Lei, Z.H. Chen, Dong-Dong Guo, Fulu Shi, Tao Wang, Atmosphere. 15(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399285602

                Ethanol as a renewable fuel has been applied in fuel vehicles (FVs), and it is promising in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). This work aims to investigate the emission characteristics of ethanol applied in both FVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). The paper conducted a real-road test of an internal combustion FV and PHEV, respectively, based on the world light vehicle test cycle (WLTC) by using gasoline and regular gasoline under different temperature conditions. The use of E10 and E20 in FVs has been effective in reducing the conventional emissions of the vehicles. At 23 &#176;C, E10 and E20 reduced the conventional emissions including carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbon compound (THC), non-methane hydrocarbon compound (NMHC), particulate matter (PM), and particulate number (PN) by 15.40&#8211;31.11% and 11.00&#8211;44.13% respectively. At 6 &#176;C, E10 and E20 reduced conventional emissions including THC, CO, and PM by 2.15&#8211;8.61% and 11.02&#8211;13.34%, respectively. However, nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions increased to varying degrees. The reduction trend of non-conventional emissions including methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2) from FVs fueled with E10 and E20 is not significant for vehicles. Overall, the emission reduction effect of E20 is better than that of E10, and the emission reduction effect of ethanol gasoline on vehicle emissions is reduced at low temperatures. Lower ambient temperatures increase vehicle emissions in the low-speed segment but decrease vehicle emissions in the ultra-high-speed segment. HEV emissions of THC, CO, PN, and PM are reduced by 25.28%, 12.72%, 77.34%, and 64.59%, respectively, for E20 compared to gasoline, and the use of E20 in HEVs contributes to the reduction of overall vehicle emissions.</description>

      <title>Predicted C&#8211;N Coupling Performance of Lateral Heterostructure Interfaces between Two Types of Layered Materials for Electrochemical Synthesis of Acetamide and Ammonia Via Coreduction of Co2 and N2</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4851398</link>

                Currently, carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) can convert CO2 into many high-value hydrocarbon chemicals via electrochemical processes, contributing to achieving energy conservation and emission reduction. Importantly, this method also guides the electrocatalytic synthesis of organonitrogen chemicals via C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N coupling, such as acetamide synthesis during the coelectroreduction of CO2 and N2. Herein, we utilized density functional theory calculations to predict the C&#8211;N coupling performance of *CCO and NH3 for acetamide synthesis on lateral heterostructure (LHS) interfaces of two types of layered materials: Type-A includes NbS2/MoS2, NbS2/TaS2, NbS2/WS2, MoS2/TaS2, and TaS2/WS2; Type-B contains LHS NbS2/AlN, NbS2/GaN, NbS2/ZnO, MoS2/AlN, MoS2/GaN, MoS2/ZnO, TaS2/AlN, TaS2/GaN, TaS2/ZnO, and WS2/AlN, WS2/GaN, WS2/ZnO. However, achieving simultaneous C&#8211;C coupling and C&#8211;N coupling remains a great challenge in designing catalysts. To address this, we systemically investigated these LHS catalysts, evaluating factors such as adsorption stability, electroconductivity, catalytic activity, selectivity, and electronic properties. Our findings suggest that MoS2/WS2 and NbS2/ZnO may be potential catalysts, facilitating acetamide synthesis from CO2 and N2 reduction with low limiting potentials of &#8722;1.11 and &#8722;0.97 V, respectively. The reaction pathway of CO2RR involves the formation of CO, C&#8211;C coupling via keto&#8722;enol tautomerism to form ketene (*CCO), N2 reduction, and C&#8211;N coupling between NH3 and *CCO to produce *CC(OH)NH2, finally resulting in acetamide production. Most of these LHS junction catalysts exhibit metallic and semiconductor electronic states, except for MoS2/GaN, which possesses a large band gap of up to 3.73 eV. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that NbS2/AlN, NbS2/GaN, TaS2/ZnO, WS2/AlN, and WS2/ZnO effectively suppress competing byproducts, ensuring the formation of *CCO and promoting nucleophilic reactions leading to *CC(OH)NH2 during *CC(OH)NH2. This strategic approach enables the synthesis of organonitrogen chemicals via C&#8211;N coupling in the coreduction of CO2 and NOx, expanding the scope of hydrocarbon products derived from CO2RR. The LHS catalysts identified in this study may be employed to form amide chemicals.</description>

                Electrolysis of bicarbonate&#8208;containing CO2 capture solutions is a promising approach towards achieving low&#8208;cost carbon&#8208;neutral chemicals production. However, the parasitic bicarbonate&#8208;mediated hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and electrode instability in the presence of trace impurities remain major obstacles to overcome. This work demonstrates that the combined use of titanium dioxide (TiO2) overlayers with the chelating agent ethylene diamine tetra&#8208;acetic acid (EDTA) significantly enhances the selectivity and stability of Ag&#8208;based electrocatalysts for bicarbonate electrolysis. The amorphous TiO2 overlayers suppress the HER by over 50% at potentials more negative than &#8208;0.7 V vs. RHE, increasing the CO faradaic efficiency (FE) by 33% (relative). In situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurements reveal the absence of near&#8208;surface bicarbonate species and an abundance of CO2 reduction intermediates at the Ag|TiO2 buried interface, suggesting that the overlayers suppress HER by blocking bicarbonate ions from reaching the buried active sites. In accelerated degradation tests with 5 ppm of Fe(III) impurity, the addition of EDTA allows stable CO production with &gt;47% FE, while the electrodes rapidly deactivate in the absence of EDTA. This work highlights the use of TiO2 overlayers for enhancing the CO:H2 ratio while simultaneously protecting electrocatalysts from impurities likely to be present in &#8220;open&#8221; carbon capture systems.</description>

      <title>Embodied Carbon in New Zealand Commercial Construction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17112629</link>
      <description>David H. Finnie, Rehan Masood, Seth Goldsworthy, Benjamin Harding, Energies. 17(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399185883

                Decarbonization is gaining priority from the macro to the micro level. However, achieving this is a critical challenge, as industries are still immature. This study explores the practices used to calculate and reduce embodied carbon (EC) in New Zealand (NZ) commercial construction projects. In the Paris Agreement, NZ pledged to reduce its net GHG emissions to 50 percent below the gross 2005 levels by 2030. The built environment generates approximately 40% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with 11% being generated by manufacturing materials. EC represents carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the atmosphere throughout the extraction, fabrication, transportation, and assembly of building materials. A survey questionnaire was distributed to stakeholders in commercial construction via the New Zealand Institute of Quantity Surveyors (NZIQS) open forum. Twenty-seven valid responses were analyzed. The survey tested and expanded on the interview findings. Calculating and reducing EC are not mandatory in NZ. Most industry professionals had yet to experience EC calculation in projects. Clients most commonly drive EC reduction in public projects with calculations that are often conducted during the concept or detailed design stages. The challenges in measuring and lowering EC include a lack of client willingness to fund EC calculation, lack of knowledge and experience, lack of previous cost data, lack of EC materials, and lack of fit-for-purpose EC calculation tools. These findings may inform NZ government policy initiatives supporting EC reduction to meet their 2050 target.</description>

      <title>Additive effects of basalt enhanced weathering and biochar co-application on carbon sequestration, soil nutrient status and plant performance in a mesocosm experiment</title>

                Co-deployment of a portfolio of carbon removal technologies is anticipated in order to remove several gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and meet climate targets. However, co-application effects between carbon removal technologies have rarely been examined, despite multiple recent perspectives suggesting potential synergies between basalt enhanced weathering and biochar application. To study the co-application effects of basalt for enhanced weathering and biochar on carbon sequestration, along with related co-benefits and risks, we conducted a fully replicated factorial mesocosm experiment with wheat. Basalt applied alone (74 t ha-1) resulted in an estimated carbon sequestration potential of 1.13 t of equivalent CO2 ha-1 over the course of approximately 6 months. Co-application with biochar (12 t ha-1) did not significantly increase estimated carbon sequestration potential. Total alkalinity fluxes and isotopic evidence indicated nearly exactly additive effects of basalt and biochar co-applied, with no significant interaction effect. Biochar carbon sequestration, approximately 32 t of equivalent CO2 ha-1 in our experiment, was unaffected by basalt addition during our experiment. Co-benefits of basalt and biochar on plant biomass as well as nutrient uptake and availability similarly mostly showed additive tendencies when co-applied. Nonetheless, a few synergistic tendencies were observed when co-applied for plant potassium and magnesium uptake as well as soil calcium availability. Soil calcium availability increased by 126% compared to expected effects based on separate application. Finally, we did not observe a reduction in the increased uptake of potentially harmful trace elements released from basalt when co-applied with biochar. Overall, our results support the co-application of basalt for enhanced weathering and biochar, with additive effects on carbon sequestration and additive, if not synergistic, effects on associated co-benefits.</description>

                Biogas represents an important renewable source alternative to fossil fuels, which can significantly contribute to the reduction of global warming and the gradual decarbonisation. In this work, the purification of CH4 and CO2 from a biogas mixture was investigated using DD3R zeolite membrane modules, as a possible solution to replace the traditional techniques at higher environmental impact (i.e., solvent absorption and cryogenic distillation). Multistage membrane configurations operating at 25&#176;C and 30 bar were proposed and explored to get highly pure biomethane (concentration of 98%) and carbon dioxide (concentration of 99.5%), imposing a recovery of both the species higher than 90%. Then, an economic analysis was carried out, evaluating the economic potential of each configuration as a function of several parameters, such as membrane module cost, biomethane selling price, CO2 permeance, CO2/CH4 selectivity, feed flow rate and pressure. The multistage schemes were found to be promising in a wide range of zeolite membrane module cost (i.e., up to 2000 $/m2), providing positive values of the economic potential, due to the good recovery of both the components, which produced high revenues. The increment of the CO2 permeance and, especially, of the feed flow rate (i.e., plant size) allowed for a more profitable process. In particular, if feed flow rate increased from 100 to 1000 Nm3/h, the economic potential would grow of about 12 times, from 113 to 1370 thousand dollars per year. Hence, this preliminary economic assessment showed that zeolite membranes can be successfully used in biogas treatment to get pure CH4 and CO2. Such an analysis can be applied to any membrane materials, once permeance and selectivity are fixed.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Sustainability Analysis of Construction Projects to Achieve Net-Zero Emission Goal by 2050</title>

                Many regard the construction industry as a non-sustainable sector due to its energy-intensive activities, coupled with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and low productivity. According to a recent United Nations Environment Program report, building and construction account for 36% of global energy use and 37% of energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas emissions. Concerning the current emerging rules and regulations related to sustainability, Canada has introduced the 2030 emission reduction plan, which aims to achieve clean air and a strong economy. The 2030 plan is a detailed road map that outlines a sector-by-sector path for Canada to reach its emissions reduction target of 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050, and it is intended to be continuously updated. The construction industry is also involved in the 2030 emission reduction plan, as it has a prominent role in generating emissions during the life cycle of its projects. Therefore, the construction industry has no option but to shift gradually toward achieving sustainability. The core concept of sustainable construction is to maximize value and minimize harm by achieving a balance between social, economic, technical, and environmental aspects, commonly known as the pillars of sustainability. In general, the integration of sustainability in any construction project remains a complex and open issue due to the involvement of a large number of factors influencing the decision. This paper analyzed significant factors causing greenhouse gas emissions considering the project's complete life cycle and developed a framework to suggest action plans to reduce those gradually. The outcome is expected to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers, industry practitioners and policymakers to integrate the information available to support decision-making to achieve net-zero GHG emissions targets in construction.</description>

                The infrastructure of a country depends significantly on cement concrete as the primary construction material. The aggregate comprises a significant proportion of the overall volume of concrete. However, the ongoing extraction of granite rock to obtain coarse aggregate contributes to the escalating need for natural resources among future generations. Due to its high carbon dioxide (CO2) footprint, the cement industry is a significant contributor to global warming. An appropriate reduction in the amount of cement in concrete without affecting its key properties can result in economical and sustainable development of the construction industry. In this investigation, agricultural waste coconut shell is considered as a substitute for conventional aggregate in concrete to produce lightweight coconut shell concrete. The alccofine-1203 contains ultrafine particles with a distinctive composition that enhances the pozzolanic and hydration process in concrete. Alccofine ranging from 5 % to 15 % were added to cement. The results demonstrated that the 10 % alccofine enhanced the fresh and mechanical properties of the lightweight coconut shell concrete. Using a combination of coconut shell and alccofine in concrete would be the most environmentally sustainable option in the construction industry.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Multi-Criteria Decision Support Model for Sustainable Ship Queuing Policy Application via Vessel Traffic Service (VTS)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114615</link>

                The International Maritime Organization (IMO) persistently improves policies to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from maritime operations, emphasizing the significance of operational measures. Simultaneously, heightened recognition of collaborative efforts within the maritime sector has increased the applicability of arrival policies like Just-In-Time Arrival (JITA), aimed at curtailing unnecessary anchorage time and emissions affecting adjacent communities in port vicinities. Nevertheless, ongoing initiatives advocate adopting JITA over the prevailing First Come, First Served (FCFS) policy, which is perceived as inefficient and, in the meantime, fair in the shipping industry. This research introduces an integrated decision support model to facilitate the implementation of a sustainable ship queuing policy by the VTS. The model addresses critical concerns, including the priorities of relevant authorities, the duration of nautical services for incoming vessels, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions attributable to anchorage waiting times. The decision support framework presented integrates the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and PROMETHEE II methodologies; the study&#8217;s outcomes suggest that the model significantly reduces ships&#8217; unnecessary CO2 emissions during anchorage waiting periods compared to the FCFS policy, with reduction rates ranging from 32.8% to 45% based on case analysis. Moreover, the proposed model ensures fairness by treating competing arriving ships equitably according to predefined criteria.</description>

                Summary COP28 closed with a historic agreement signalling the "transitioning away' from fossil fuels by laying the ground for a swift, just and equitable transition, underpinned by deep emissions cuts and scaled-up finance. Capturing and storing gigatonnes of CO2 annually is crucial for a just and sustainable transition to net-zero emissions by 2050 as CCS technology offers the potential to significantly reduce emissions from energy and industrial processes and enable large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Leveraging 40 years of CCS history, new and impactful collaborations between experts in the CCS industry and pioneering research groups, equipped with the pan-European ECCSEL research infrastructure, will create competitive CCS technologies, increase value, and reduce risk for industry and society through strategic competence and capacity building, supporting the achievement of emissions reduction targets. Since the pace of CCS implementation is of the utmost importance, industrial actors must make use of existing CCS knowledge to secure the necessary investments. It is essential that research and industry work closely together to secure knowledge that can be used for deployment, as well as research new challenges that arise from deployment activities.</description>

      <title>On the Post-Heat Behavior of Cement Mortar Containing Mechanically Modified Ground Coal Bottom Ash</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.56294/sctconf2024813</link>
      <description>Mohammad I. Al Biajawi, Rahimah Embong, Khairunisa Muthusamy, Haneen Abdel Jabar, Nahla Hilal, Fadzli Mohamed Nazri, Salud, Ciencia y Tecnolog&#237;a - Serie de Conferencias. 3(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399213652

                Coal is widely recognized as a significant and essential fuel source due to its capacity to undergo combustion and produce heat in many different regions worldwide. Over the course of many decades, there has been a notable rise in power usage among individuals, thus resulting in an upsurge in the utilization of coal. The growth of mankind has a parallel rising trajectory with the utilization of cement in the building industry, as well as a corresponding rise in cement manufacturing. These two phenomena significantly contribute to the escalation of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the improper disposal of coal ash, both of which pose significant environmental hazards. Coal-fired thermal power plants generate many waste products from industry, including coal-bottom ash (CBA), which may be effectively used in the production of mortar or concrete. This practice not only promotes the adoption of sustainable construction materials but also encourages the utilization of these wastes. In contrast, it is worth noting that cement manufacture yields a significant quantity of carbon dioxide emissions, so exerting a detrimental influence on the ecosystem. The reduction of environmental deterioration may be achieved by substituting cement with waste products. The substitution of Portland cement with reutilized coal combustion products has the potential to provide significant environmental and infrastructural advantages. This study presents an experimental investigation into the post-heat performance of cement mortars including ground coal bottom ash (CBA). To achieve this objective, an investigation was conducted to assess the strength qualities, residual strength, and mass losses of mortar specimens. These specimens comprised varying proportions (10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%) of CBA as a substitute for cement. To perform the heating procedure, samples were subjected to temperatures of 200&#176;C, 400&#176;C, and 600&#176;C, which corresponded to room temperatures. The findings indicate that the use of ground CBA up to a proportion of 20% yields mortar with the maximum value of compressive strength compared with the control sample. The use of a substantial amount of ground CBA has been shown to produce the most significant reduction in mass and decrease in strength when subjected to high temperatures. As a result, the residual strength of concrete experiences a decrease of 33.65% when exposed to a temperature of 600&#176;C in conventional concrete while for CBA in concrete decreases around 40.9% . In general, the integration of ground CBA alternatives as an alternative to cement would result in a decrease in the need for the manufacture of cement and the environmental pollution associated with CBA discharge.</description>

      <title>Efficacy of Salvia officinalis Shrub as a Sustainable Feed Additive for Reducing Ruminal Methane Production and Enhancing Fermentation in Ruminants</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ani14111648</link>

                The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the inclusion of dried Salvia officinalis (SO) shrub leaves on nutrient degradability, ruminal in vitro fermentation, gas production (GP), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) productions. Dried and ground SO shrub leaves were included at 0% (control), 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2% DM of a diet consisting of (per kg DM) 500 g concentrate feed mixture, 400 g berseem hay, and 100 g rice straw. The diet was incubated for 48 h. The asymptotic GP and the rate of GP changed linearly and quadratically (p &lt; 0.01), with the highest GP observed at 1% inclusion of SO and then decreasing thereafter with greater inclusion (i.e., 1.5% and 2%), while CH4 production and its rate decreased linearly (p &lt; 0.01) with all levels of SO inclusion. A linear increase in CO2 production and its rate was also found with an increasing level of SO inclusion in the diet (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the degradability of DM, NDF, and the concentration of total short-chain fatty acids and acetate changed linearly and quadratically, with the greatest being found at 1% SO inclusion and then steadily declining after (p &lt; 0.01) with the 1.5% and 2% inclusion levels. Meanwhile, the propionate, NH3-N, and microbial crude protein levels showed similar trends, with the plateau found at 1% inclusion of SO, where there was no change in butyrate concentration. Moreover, the pH, metabolizable energy, and partitioning factor (PF24) also changed linearly and quadratically (p &lt; 0.05), where the pH and PF24 were considerably reduced and ME increased with a 1% inclusion of SO (p &lt; 0.05). In summary, SO at 1% inclusion in the diet showed the potential to improve gas production kinetics, nutrient degradability, and the ruminal fermentation profile, with a more significant reduction in ruminal CH4 production suggesting that SO at 1% could be included in the ruminant diet to reduce their carbon footprint and increase the production performance.</description>

                The China-Europe Railway Express (CRE) has attracted and fostered low-carbon, export-oriented manufacturing industry; thus, it could reduce carbon dioxide emissions through manufacturing industry substitution effect. To verify this new mechanism, this study focuses on a specific case, namely, Chongqing's electronic and telecommunications equipment (ETE) manufacturing industry, as this sector is a low-carbon industry promoted by the CRE. This study proposes a novel detour estimation strategy for causal identification of the environmental externality of CRE on carbon dioxide emissions. The results show that the CRE could contribute to an increase of 567.06 billion yuan in ETE exports from Chongqing to Europe and a consequent reduction of 17.10 million tons of carbon dioxide between 2011 and 2021. This study provides new insights into the environmental externality of CRE and the mechanism of manufacturing industry substitution effect, contributing to the understanding of the relationship between transportation and carbon dioxide emissions.</description>

      <title>Deployment of carbon removal technologies could reduce the rapid and potentially disruptive pace of decarbonization in South Africa&#8217;s climate ambitions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.142753</link>
      <description>Sandylove Afrane, Jeffrey Dankwa Ampah, Zhao Jinjuan, Pingjian Yang, Jian Lin Chen, Guozhu Mao, Journal of cleaner production. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399301369

                As a developing country, South Africa faces the risk of having to undertake disruptive actions to meet its internationally pledged emission reduction targets. It has become necessary to find alternative measures for South Africa to meet its climate targets without such a disruptive and aggressive transformation of its energy sector. To truly reach net-zero CO2 emissions, South Africa must ensure that residual emissions from its recalcitrant sectors are equally compensated by carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Given the potential for CDR technologies to delay the need for rapid emissions cuts, we leverage this characteristic to explore their role in helping South Africa achieve its climate targets on time, but through a less disruptive and overly aggressive pace of energy system decarbonization. Using an integrated assessment model, we show that while reaching its emission reduction targets, the presence of novel CDR (nCDR) could significantly reduce South Africa's mitigation costs, from $190-590/tCO2 without nCDR to $155-240/tCO2 with nCDR by 2050. Furthermore, the availability of nCDR may allow for a less aggressive expansion of renewable and nuclear power generation, saving about 35-55TWh/yr by 2050 compared to scenarios without nCDR. Importantly, we reveal that nCDR could help avoid the asset stranding of up to 4-6 GW and $15-25 billion in associated costs between 2016 and 2050. However, this comes at the cost of higher residual greenhouse gas emissions, as the continued reliance on fossil fuels under nCDR availability would likely lead to the perpetuation of some emissions. Overall, South Africa's priority must remain on decarbonization, especially in sectors where fuel switching and energy efficiency are feasible. Nonetheless, the complementary role of nCDR must not be underestimated, and South Africa should begin investing in these emerging technologies to support its ambitious net-zero goal.</description>

      <title>Fuel cells &#8211; Molten carbonate fuel cell | Cathodes</title>

                The molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) operates at temperatures around 650 &#176;C and uses an electrolyte of molten alkali metal carbonates. The key electrochemical reaction at the cathode is the reduction of oxygen and reaction with carbon dioxide to form carbonate ions that are transported through the molten electrolyte and converted back to carbon dioxide at the anode. Since the earliest days of development, lithiated nickel oxide (NiO) has been the material of choice for the cathode. It meets all the essential needs of the MCFC cathode except for that it slowly dissolves in the electrolyte. Over time this may lead to cell degradation through precipitation of nickel in the electrolyte and subsequent internal short circuits. Dissolution of NiO is influenced by the composition of the electrolyte as well as the pressure of the oxygen and carbon dioxide at the cathode surface. Current commercial MCFC cells have already achieved &gt;7-year durability. Approaches to further enhance durability include alternative cathode and/or electrolyte materials, or simply by limiting the operating pressure/temperature.</description>

                Based on panel data for 30 provinces in China from 2000 to 2020, this paper uses entropy method to construct the integrated development indicators of energy Internet, and explores the impact of the development of the energy Internet on reducing carbon emissions in China and its internal transmission mechanism. The research results show that the development of energy Internet can significantly reduce regional carbon dioxide emissions, and increasing the use of renewable energy is an important mechanism for the comprehensive development of energy Internet to curb carbon emissions. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the emission reduction effect brought by the development of energy Internet is more remarkable in the regions with lower carbon emissions and western China. Furthermore, this paper finds that in the setting of the development of energy Internet, the development of renewable energy can promote natural gas consumption and advance energy conversion efficiency. The government&#8217;s emphasis on regional technology development has an external strengthening effect on carbon emission reduction. The research in this paper expands and diversifies carbon reduction pathways and provides reference for more developing countries to utilize the development of energy internet to achieve carbon reduction.</description>

                This study aimed to examine the actual effects of policies by applying a quasi-experimental methodology to the second phase of China&#8217;s low-carbon pilot city project. Particularly, we tried to investigate whether a significant reduction in particulate matter and carbon emissions occurred through the implementation of the policy. Analyzing 31 cities in China from 2008 to 2018, the study revealed a significant decrease in both particulate matter and carbon dioxide emissions in the pilot cities compared to non-pilot cities post-policy implementation. Further categorization of cities into groups based on a GDP of over 90,000 yuan and cities with a secondary industry contribution exceeding 50% indicated that the pilot city initiatives had the most substantial effects in these areas. Additionally, deriving insights from the analysis of factors influencing particulate matter and carbon emissions, the study drew policy implications. These findings underscore the significant practical impact of municipally-led, city-specific approaches in China&#8217;s environmental policies.</description>

                Reducing carbon dioxide emissions has become a prominent issue in city construction. Here, with the objective of spatial pattern optimization, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for low-carbon cities. To shed further light on the mechanism by which green finance facilitates the low-carbon transformation of the economy, we chose Xi'an as a study area, used the system dynamics model, simulated the relationship between different factors in the development of low-carbon cities, and provided guidance for spatial planning of low-carbon cities. Through systematic analysis of results, we found that with the progress of urbanization and the improvement of people's living standards, the carbon emissions from urban buildings in Xi'an will increase annually and reach 2.47 million tons by 2030. In scenario 1, the faster pace of urbanization raises carbon emissions from urban buildings by 3%, to 2.5543 million tons from the base. In contrast, in Scenario 2, the reduction in urbanization rate results in a decrease in urban building carbon emissions to 2.4243 million tons, a reduction of 2.26% compared to the baseline scenario. Thus it can be seen that diverse modifications of parameters exert distinct effects on the ultimate carbon emissions from urban buildings.</description>

      <title>Experimentally assessing the uncertainty of forecasts of geological carbon storage</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2024.104162</link>

                Geological storage of carbon dioxide is a cornerstone in almost every realistic emissions reduction scenario outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Our ability to accurately forecast storage efficacy is, however, mostly unknown due to the long timescales involved (hundreds to thousands of years). To study perceived forecast accuracy, we designed a double-blind forecasting study. As ground truth, we constructed a laboratory-scale carbon storage operation, retaining the essential physical processes active on the field scale, within a time span of five days. Separately, academic groups with experience in carbon storage research were invited to forecast key carbon storage efficacy metrics. The participating groups submitted forecasts in two stages: First independently without any cross-group interaction, then finally after workshops designed to share and assimilate understanding between the forecast groups. Their confidence in reported forecasts was monitored throughout the forecasting study. Our results show that participating groups provided forecasts that appear bias-free with respect to carbon storage as a technology, yet the forecast intervals are too narrow to capture the ground truth (overconfidence bias). When asked to qualitatively self-assess their forecast uncertainty (and later when asked to provide an external assessment of other forecast groups), the assessment of the participants indicated an understanding that the forecast intervals (both their own and those of others) were too narrow. However, the participants did not display an understanding of how poorly the forecast intervals calibrated to the ground truth. The quantitative uncertainty assessments contrast the qualitative comments supplied by the participants, which indicate an acute awareness of the challenges associated with assessing the uncertainty of forecasts for complex systems such as the geological storage of carbon dioxide.</description>

      <title>Scanning Bubble Electrochemical Microscopy: Mapping of Electrocatalytic Activity with Low-Solubility Reactants</title>

                Determining electrocatalytic activity for reactions that involve reactants with limited solubility presents a significant challenge due to the reduced mass-transport to the electrocatalyst surface. This limitation is seen in important reactions such as the oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. We introduce a new approach, which we call scanning bubble electrochemical microscopy, to enable the detection and high-resolution mapping of electrocatalytic activity with low-solubility reactants at high mass-transport rates. Using a scanning probe approach, a dual-barreled nanopipette is used to precisely deliver the gas-phase reactant within micrometers of an electrocatalyst surface, which results in high mass-transport rates at the electrocatalyst surface directly under the probe. We demonstrate the scanning bubble electrochemical microscopy approach by mapping the oxygen reduction reaction on model platinum microelectrode surfaces. We anticipate that scanning bubble electrochemical microscopy will provide an effective tool for measuring the electrocatalytic activity of reactants that have limited solubility.</description>

      <title>Monitoring technology of near-surface atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration in multiple regions based on unmanned aerial vehicle</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1117/12.3032121</link>

                Due to the unclear distribution of near-surface atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) in small areas, by choosing Yulin City and Xi'an City as the research areas and applying Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to carry out atmospheric CO2 concentration monitoring at multiple carbon monitoring points, this study explores the impact of ground object type, height and time on atmospheric CO2 concentration. Regarding the temporal variation, the atmospheric CO2 concentration of the vegetation-covered area in the afternoon is lower than that in the morning in summer, and only the evergreen vegetation-covered area in winter has similar characteristics as that in summer. The near-surface atmospheric CO2 concentration in the vegetated area changes greatly in summer and winter. For the characteristics of vertical distribution of CO2, the CO2 concentration gradually decreases with increasing altitude. In summer, the CO2 concentration in areas affected by human activities decreases rapidly from 0 to 50 meters and decreases slowly from 50 to 150 meters. The CO2 concentration in vegetation-covered areas decreases slightly from 0 to 150 meters. In winter, the areas affected by human activities and the vegetation-covered areas both decrease rapidly from 0&#8211;20 meters and relatively slowly from 20 meters to 100 meters. The experimental results indicate that using UAVs can accurately monitor the atmospheric CO2 concentration near the surface of typical land features in small areas. UAVs can form air-space-ground carbon monitoring networks with satellites and ground observation points, which is of great significance for quantitative analysis of carbon reduction paths to achieve peak carbon dioxide emission and carbon neutralization.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Caprock Integrity and Fault Reactivity for the First China Offshore Ccs Hub Operation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4848476</link>

                Since the Paris Agreement, the world has reached a consensus that CCS/CCUS technology is the most efficient and priority choice to achieve carbon reduction, emission reduction, and temperature control after extensive explorations to fulfill their commitments. China faces a natural contradiction in its carbon dioxide sequestration efforts while the eastern part of the country is rich in carbon sources but lacks geological storage capacity. Therefore, making use of marine sedimentary basins for offshore CCS/CCUS becomes an inevitable choice to achieve China's "dual carbon" goal. In pursuit of this goal, CNOOC Limited has conducted a series of explorations and practices and launched China's first offshore CCS/CCUS industrial cluster project. Through preliminary research on this project, we realized that China's offshore basins generally exhibit strong structural activity, poor reservoir or caprock distribution continuity, and extensive fault development compared to onshore storage sites and foreign typical offshore CCS projects. As such, evaluating caprock integrity and fault reactivity becomes crucial in monitoring the risk associated with offshore CCS. Here, to address these challenges, a reactive transport modeling with a geomechanics module was employed to examine caprock integrity and fault reactivity at the first China offshore CCS Hub operation using a geological model constructed from near-site existing well logging and seismic data. The results from the model demonstrate that caprock integrity and fault reactivity at this offshore CCS site are safe and stable under injectivity scales of 2 Mt., 5 Mt., and 10 Mt. during the operational period.</description>

      <title>Direct use of low-concentration CO2 in the synthesis of dialkyl carbonates, carbamate acid esters, and urea derivatives</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcou.2024.102814</link>
      <description>Katsuhiko Takeuchi, Hiroki Koizumi, Haruki Nagae, Kazuhiro Matsumoto, Norihisa Fukaya, Kazuhiko Sat&#333;, Junho Choi, Journal of CO2 utilization. 83(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399236708

                The CO2 in thermal power plant and factory exhaust gases and the air must be addressed because all have low-concentration CO2. However, applying low-concentration CO2 to developed reactions that use high-purity CO2, energy- and cost-intensive pretreatments, such as CO2 purification, concentration, and compression, are required. Thus, a technology that directly converts low-concentration CO2 into useful chemicals without these pretreatment processes is attractive for energy saving and cost reduction. Such technology has been achieved in the fields of methane and methanol synthesis via the hydrogen reduction of CO2. Recently, the concept of directly using low-concentration CO2 has been applied to the synthesis of high value-added chemicals without hydrogen reduction. The synthesis of useful chemicals from CO2 without hydrogen reduction is a technology that will be put into practical use without waiting for the widespread use of green hydrogen. Thus, this review introduces the technology for the direct synthesis of useful chemicals, such as dialkyl carbonates (DRCs), carbamic acid esters (CAEs), and urea derivatives from low-concentration CO2 contained in exhaust gas or air, without hydrogen reduction. DRCs, CAEs, and urea derivatives are synthesized via the non-hydrogen reduction route of CO2. They are expected to contribute to long-term, large-volume CO2 fixation because they are raw materials of functional polymers, which have long-material-life and large market potential. Details on how to synthesize these compounds directly from low-concentration CO2 are presented, focusing on the efforts to devise CO2 capture processes, reactants, and catalysts.</description>

                Summary A massive and rapid reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is required to effectively address climate change and comply with international agreements. CCS technologies have been successfully applied and can actively contribute to this goal. By interpreting 2D and 3D seismic and well data, a regional model of the Bunter Sandstone Formation in the Southern North Sea has been built to investigate the feasibility of basin-scale carbon storage. Furthermore, parameters that affect long-term plume migration in saline aquifers have been studied. This comprehensive analysis of static modelling and reservoir simulation has shown that migration naturally occurs over decades and centuries, with distinct patterns during and after injection phases. Consequently, plume evolution is influenced by reservoir heterogeneities, connectivity, and top structure shapes, which also help increase trapping mechanisms. Moreover, existing pressure gradients stimulate hydrodynamic fluxes affecting the whole region, allowing long-term migration and containment efficiency. The complex interplay of these elements underscores the need for a deep, large-scale understanding of geological storage, but not limited to the operational time, which can potentially drive innovative strategies for expanding geological carbon storage in similar saline aquifers.</description>

      <title>How Have Land Use Carbon Emissions Changed in the Past and Future Under Multiple Scenarios? -Based on Carbon Emissions Fair Model and Plus Model</title>

                With the increase of carbon dioxide concentration, global warming has become increasingly serious, and has posed a serious threat to human survival and the ecological environment. The land use carbon emissions (LUCE) are only second to those caused by fossil fuel combustion. The affected area of the lower Yellow River (ALYR) is an essential grain producing area in China. Studying its LUCE and future development has practical significance for the low-carbon development and food security of the basin. We analyzed the characteristics and drivers of LUCE in the ALYR from 2000 &#8722; 2018 and simulated the LUCE under different scenarios in 2030. The LUCE in the ALYR were in a continuous growth trend, with a growth rate of 27.94%, and the economic efficiency and ecological carrying capacity remained stable. The built-up land area and the proportion of secondary industry in GDP can promote the LUCE, while the per capita GDP has a suppressive effect. The LUCE will decrease in 2030, with the least LUCE under the cultivated land protection scenario. The results show that it is necessary to control the built-up land and increase the area of ecological land in order to achieve carbon emission reduction. This study analyzed the LUCE in the ALYR from the different periods, providing a theoretical reference for promoting sustainable development of the basin and scientific land use management.</description>

                The 28th meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP 28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, concluded in December 2023. The meeting discussed the overarching goal of the legally binding Paris Agreement to limit &#8220;global average temperature to well below 2 &#176;C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 &#176;C above pre-industrial levels&#8221;. The COP 28 recognised recent findings of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that &#8220;limiting global warming to 1.5 &#176;C with no or limited overshoot requires deep, rapid and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions of 43% by 2030 and 60% by 2035 relative to the 2019 level, and reaching net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050&#8221;.</description>

      <title>Mechanism study on CO2 hydrogenation to methanol on Cu5/TiO2 catalyst</title>

                Copper clusters supported on TiO2 have demonstrated exceptional performance in catalyzing the reduction of CO2. However, there is a lack of detailed studies on the underlying mechanism. In this study, we employ first-principles thermodynamics and kinetic calculations to unveil the catalytic reduction mechanism of CO2 to C1 product on the Cu5/TiO2 catalyst. Our calculations reveal that the interaction between the cluster and the support significantly enhances the chemical adsorption of CO2 and lowers the dissociation barrier of H2, creating favorable conditions for hydrogenation reduction of CO2. Additionally, our findings suggest that the Cu5 cluster also significantly enhances the adsorption of *CO intermediates, resulting in a preference for the RWGS pathway over the formate pathway for CO2 reduction. The rate-determining barrier for CH3OH formation is considerably lower than that for CH4 formation, indicating that Cu5/TiO2 exhibits remarkable CO2 conversion performance with nearly 100 % selectivity towards CH3OH production.</description>

                The gas sensors were prepared using carbon quantum dots (CQDs) using an electrochemical method after mixing the CQDs with Tris (8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (III) (Alq3) polymer. A spin coating technique was used to deposit CQDs/Alq3 composite film on glass substrates with a ratio of 1:1. The CQDs/Alq3 gas sensor showed a sensitivity of about 24&#1642; at a temperature of 300 &#8451;, and this was calculated after measuring the change in the resistance of the samples with a response time of 2 and 8sec recovery time. The sensor showed a good response for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gas. However, the sensitivity, response time, and recovery time for the CQDs gas sensor when exposed to NO2 gas at 300 &#176;C were 78%, 4s, and 129s, respectively. The results showed that the best sensor CQDs/Alq3 led to a reduction in the recovery time, which shows the importance of the Alq3 polymer in improving the properties of the gas sensor.</description>

                Abstract A sealed reciprocating tribometer has been used to study the influence of different gaseous environments on the friction and wear properties of AISI52100 bearing steel at atmospheric pressure and 25&#176;C. Helium, argon, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen all give high friction and wear, suggestive of very little, if any tribofilm formation under the conditions studied. Dry air and oxygen also give high friction, slightly lower than the inert gases, but produce extremely high wear, much higher than the inert gases. This is characteristic of the phenomenon of &#8220;oxidational wear&#8221;. The two gases ammonia and carbon monoxide give relatively low friction and wear, and XPS analysis indicates that this is due to the formation of adsorbed ammonia/nitride and carbonate films respectively. For the hydrocarbon gases studied, two factors appear to control friction and wear, degree of unsaturation and molecular weight. For the saturated hydrocarbons, methane and ethane give high friction and wear but propane and butane give low friction after a period of rubbing that decreases with molecular weight. The unsaturated hydrocarbons all give an immediate reduction in friction with correspondingly low wear. Raman analysis shows that all the hydrocarbons that reduce friction and wear form a carbonaceous tribofilm of the rubbed surfaces.</description>

                Abstract Climate change poses manifold consequences to the world&#8217;s ecosystems and human well-being. Greenhouse gas emissions reduction and climate-friendly technological innovations at the corporate level are considered effective measures to mitigate climate change. Using the Bayesian Mindsponge Framework (BMF) to analyze 178 enterprises listed in the Standard and Poor&#8217;s 500 companies from 2016 to 2021, this paper examines how companies&#8217; climate risk-mitigating efforts can affect their market value. We found that emitted carbon dioxide negatively affects the stock price. Meanwhile, companies&#8217; income and climate risk-mitigating efforts, including producing eco-friendly products, using renewable energy, and environmental investments, are positively associated with their share value. However, the effects of these efforts are conditional on the companies&#8217; income. Based on these findings, we suggest that building an eco-surplus culture among investors and improving their climate change knowledge can be a promising approach to promoting a corporation&#8217;s mitigation efforts.</description>

                Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have devastating effects on ecosystems and impact regional air-sea CO2 exchange. Yet a global assessment of these regional impacts of MHWs on the air-sea CO2 exchange is missing. Here, we analyze thirty global observation-based air-sea CO2 flux datasets from 1990 to 2019. We observe minimal reduction in global oceanic CO2 uptake during MHWs. Regional variations are evident with the equatorial Pacific experiencing a 31% (spread across datasets: 3-49%) reduction in carbon release, suggesting that MHWs are the dominant drivers of strong air-sea CO2 flux anomalies in this region. In low-to-mid latitudes, MHWs cause a 29% (19-37%) decrease in air-sea CO2 uptake. Reduced dissolved inorganic carbon in the tropics weakens outgassing, while high ocean temperatures diminish uptake in the low-to-mid latitudes. In the North Pacific and Southern Ocean, enhanced carbon uptake occurs during MHWs, but uncertainties in pCO2 datasets limit a comprehensive assessment in these regions.</description>

                Summary In this paper, we investigate microbial representatives from the worldwide first pilot project on hydrogen storage and in-situ methanation conducted in the Lehen Gasfield in Upper Austria. A microfluidic approach was used to investigate biomass accumulation in the pore space. Particular attention was paid to the growth and detachment mechanisms and the resulting microscopic structure formation, which was imaged with high spatial and temporal resolution. By combining microfluidic experiments with direct numerical simulations on digital twins, the influence of biomass accumulation on the hydraulic properties was quantified, including the intrinsic biomass permeability. A decisive factor for the nutrient supply of the biomass and, thus, the gas conversion rate. The quantification of the relationship between permeability and porosity reduction provides a deep insight into the general hydraulic conductivity of the altered system. The study compares the microbial consortium extracted from the Lehen field and M. formicicum, an extracted active species of the consortium. The experiments were carried out under saturated flow conditions, with the nutrient gas hydrogen and carbon dioxide dissolved in the aqueous phase. This represents a limiting case of a completely mobile aqueous phase, in contrast to the other limiting case of immobile connate water saturation.</description>

                Driving co-abatement of Greenhouse Gas (GHGs) and Air Pollutants (APs) in the city level is crucial for fostering societal green and low-carbon transitions, yet comprehensive and refined researches at this level remain limited. To facilitate subtle and precise urban management of GHGs control and APs reduction, this study targeted almost all anthropogenic emission sources in Shanghai, a typical megacity of China, analyzing the co-benefits of GHGs and APs via emissions flow, spatial distribution, hotspot identification, and scenario prediction. Results highlighted the source heterogeneity of different species and significant contributions of energy consumption. CO2 emissions showed a strong spatial correlation with SO2, NOx, and CO, followed by VOCs and PM. Hotspots for co-abatement included power plants, steel enterprises, petrochemical enterprises and chemical industrial parks in coastal areas, and airports. Achieving positive co-benefits in industrial sector would depend on the steady decline of CO2 emissions in power generation and steel industries. Introducing carbon capture devices and improving energy efficiency would be more conducive to CO2 emission reduction, while energy cleaning and elimination of backwardness are more effective in reducing APs. These mitigation measures could achieve 68.8% and 47.6% reduction for CO2 and APs by 2050, respectively.</description>

      <title>Balancing Progress: Economic Growth, Innovation, and Political Influence on Carbon Emissions in Developing Nations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4849395</link>

                The challenge of reconciling economic development with environmental sustainability amidst resource constraints poses a significant dilemma for governments. This dilemma often necessitates difficult choices between prioritizing economic growth or environmental protection. Despite the growing body of literature on economic growth, CO2 emissions, and related topics, certain critical factors such as innovation and political institutions remain understudied, despite their profound impacts on CO2 emissions and environmental degradation. Moreover, existing literature on these subjects is either limited or contradictory. Therefore, this study explores the influence of political institutions, economic growth, FDI inflows, and innovation on CO2 emissions. Additionally, it seeks to ascertain the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) and pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) in selected developing economies, particularly in light of political institutions. Employing panel ARDL methodology, this study aims to provide both short-run and long-run estimates. The findings of this study affirm the EKC hypothesis in selected developing economies while presenting conflicting evidence regarding the existence of the PHH. Furthermore, the study highlights the positive impact of innovation and energy consumption on CO2 emissions, contrasting with the negative correlation between population density, human capital, and CO2 emissions. Notably, it suggests that tackling corruption can lead to pollution reduction, increased government effectiveness can mitigate CO2 emissions, and enhanced political stability can enhance environmental quality. Moreover, the rule of law is found to positively influence CO2 emissions. Thus, the study concludes that robust anti-corruption measures and governance regulations are essential for pollution reduction and environmental quality improvement, while greater adherence to the rule of law fosters economic development alongside reduced CO2 emissions. Overall, this research contributes significantly to understanding the role and significance of political institutions in shaping economic growth, FDI inflows, innovation, and CO2 emissions across a broader spectrum of developing nations.</description>

                1522 Background: Greenhouse gas emissions from healthcare are substantial and harm persons with cancer. Emissions from outpatient cancer care visits are not well described, nor are the downstream reduction in human harms that could be obtained through visit &#8220;decentralization&#8221; (telemedicine and local care when possible). Methods: This life-cycle assessment (LCA)-based study evaluated changes in emissions and downstream health harms associated with (1) telemedicine visits using retrospective observational analysis and (2) fully decentralized visits using counterfactual modeling. The retrospective observational cohort included persons receiving cancer care at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) and 20 affiliated facilities between 5/2015-12/2020. The main outcome was the adjusted per visit-day difference in emissions (in kilograms carbon dioxide equivalents: kgCO 2 e) between two periods: an in-person care period (5/2015-2/2020; &#8220;Pre&#8221;) and a telemedicine period (3/2020-12/2020; &#8220;Post&#8221;). Mixed effects log-linear model assessed emissions changes adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and cancer type, with random effects on person. The counterfactual model assessed emissions changes between actual in-person visits during the Pre period and a counterfactual with maximal decentralization. Visit-day eligibility for decentralization was obtained by categorizing appointments (e.g., clinician visit, infusion) as DFCI required, local care possible, or telemedicine possible. This cohort was matched to a national population diagnosed with cancer over the same period (Cancer in North America [CiNA] dataset) using mixed-effects linear modeling, through which annual changes in disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) from clinician visit decentralization were estimated using Eckelman&#8217;s mortality cost of carbon conversion. Results: There were123,890 unique patients in the DFCI cohort seen over 1.6 million visit-days (Pre N=110,180, Post N=61,691) at a median of 6 visit-days per patient (IQR 2, 15). An estimated 72,554,006 kgCO 2 e were within scope of the LCA emitted during the study period. In mixed-effects log-linear regression, the adjusted mean absolute reduction in per visit-day emissions between Pre and Post periods was 36.4 kgCO 2 e (95%CI 36.2,36.6), or a reduction of 81.3% (95%CI 80.8,81.7) compared to the baseline model. In the counterfactual decentralized care model of the Pre period, there was a relative emissions reduction of 33.1% (95%CI 32.9,33.3). When demographically matched to 10.3 million persons in the CiNA dataset, decentralized care would have reduced national emissions by 75.3 million kgCO 2 e annually; this corresponds to an estimated annual reduction of 15.0-47.7 DALYs. Conclusions: Employing decentralization through telemedicine and local care can substantially reduce emissions during cancer care delivery; this corresponds to a small reduction in human mortality.</description>

      <title>Effect of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O Interaction with High-Rank Coal on Mechanical Properties and Acoustic Emission Characteristics under Confining Pressure</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.4c02599</link>

                The adsorption of CO2 by coal leads to changes in its mechanical properties, particularly when considering supercritical CO2 and water with supercritical CO2 adsorption. This is strongly linked to the efficiency of CO2-enhanced coalbed methane (CO2-ECBM) extraction and the safety of CO2 geological storage. This study focuses on 3# coal from the Datong Mine in Gaoping City, Shanxi Province. The high-rank coal's mechanical properties, including the triaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus, were examined under the combined effects of CO2 injection pressure, CO2 injection time, and moisture content. The triaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus of the coal showed a decrease following CO2 injection. Increasing the CO2 injection pressure, prolonging the CO2 injection time, and increasing the moisture content were favorable for coal softening. In particular, the triaxial compressive strength and elastic modulus of the coal sample after 144 h of water and supercritical CO2 softening decreased by 67.67 and 64.15%, respectively. Injecting CO2 into coal changed its failure mode. The dry raw coal sample exhibited a brittle shear failure mode, while the coal samples showed transitional shear failure after injecting 6 MPa CO2 and 8 MPa CO2 and ductile nondilatant barreling failure after injecting water and 8 MPa CO2 (with a moisture content of 3.02%). Moreover, the cumulative acoustic emission energy of the coal samples followed a similar trend to the decrease in mechanical properties under different conditions. The physical and chemical interactions among coal, CO2, and water caused the softening of coal; these included the generation of the swelling stress, the dissolution of minerals by carbonate solutions, the reduction in surface energy of coal owing to CO2 adsorption, and the extraction and plasticization reactions of organic matter in coal. The research results are of great significance for further understanding CO2-ECBM and CO2 geological sequestration.</description>

                The utilization of hydrogen fuel represents a global shift towards sustainable energy sources, yielding significant reductions in carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the abundance of renewable energy options, widespread adoption has been slow, with persistent reliance on fossil fuels. The purpose of this study was to establish the effect of strategic innovation on the performance of hydrogen fuel consumption in Kenya. The proposed objectives of this study were: to determine the effect of product innovation on the performance of hydrogen fuel consumption in Kenya, and to assess the influence of process innovation on the performance of hydrogen fuel consumption in Kenya. Employing a desktop research methodology, the study emphasizes the pivotal role of strategic innovations in fostering sustainability, product and process innovation in hydrogen fuel consumption and the renewable energy sector. This study concludes that strategic innovations, including product innovation and process innovation have a positive effect on the performance of hydrogen fuel consumption in Kenya. Further, robust policy frameworks are essential to incentivize and facilitate innovation in hydrogen fuel production. The study recommends that the Kenyan government prioritize policy formulation to stimulate hydrogen generation and utilization, integrating incentives for research and development, tax exemptions, and financial support to encourage private investment and domestic industry growth, thus reducing reliance on imports and fostering economic diversification.</description>

      <title>Exploring Sustainable Planning Strategies for Carbon Emission Reduction in Beijing&#8217;s Transportation Sector: A Multi-Scenario Carbon Peak Analysis Using the Extended STIRPAT Model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114670</link>

                The transportation sector plays a pivotal role in China&#8217;s efforts to achieve CO2 reduction targets. As the capital of China, Beijing has the responsibility to lead the era&#8217;s demand for low-carbon development and provide replicable and scalable low-carbon transportation development experience and knowledge for other cities in China. This study calculates the CO2 emissions of the transportation sector in Beijing from 1999 to 2019, constructs an extended STIRPAT model (population, affluence, technology, and efficiency), employs ridge regression to mitigate the effects of multicollinearity among the eight indicators, reveals the extent and direction of influence exerted by different indicators on CO2 emissions, and predicts the development trends, peak times, and quantities of transportation CO2 emissions in nine scenarios for Beijing from 2021 to 2035. Finally, adaptive low-carbon planning strategies are proposed for Beijing pertaining to population size and structure, industrial layout optimization, urban functional reorganization and adjustment, transportation infrastructure allocation, technological research and promotion, energy transition planning, and regional collaborative development. The results are as follows: (1) The total amount of CO2 emissions from Beijing&#8217;s transportation sector exhibits a trend of gradually stabilizing in terms of growth, with a corresponding gradual deceleration in the rate of increase. Kerosene, gasoline, and diesel are the main sources of transportation CO2 emissions in Beijing, with an annual average proportion of 95.78%. (2) The degree of influence of the indicators on transportation CO2 emissions, in descending order, is energy intensity, per capita GDP, population size, GDP by transportation sector, total transportation turnover, public transportation efficiency, possession of private vehicles, and clean energy structure. Among them, the proportion of clean energy structure and public transportation efficiency are negatively correlated with transportation CO2 emissions, while the remaining indicators are positively correlated. (3) In the nine predicted scenarios, all scenarios, except scenario 2 and scenario 4, can achieve CO2 emission peaks by 2030, while scenarios 7 and 9 can reach the peak as early as 2025. (4) The significant advancement and application of green carbon reduction technologies have profound implications, as they can effectively offset the impacts of population, economy, and efficiency indicators under extensive development. Effective population control, sustainable economic development, and transportation efficiency improvement are viable means to help achieve carbon peaking and peak value in the transportation sector.</description>

      <title>Simulation Insights into Carbon Mineralization Effects on Basaltic Seismic Properties</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3997/2214-4609.202410114</link>

                Summary This comprehensive study investigates the seismic response of basalt to CO2 injection, focusing on alterations in P- and S-wave velocities. We conduct simulations to examine how injecting CO2 into basalt affects P- and S-wave velocities, a process influenced by the substitution of water with CO2 and the formation of carbonate cement mineralization. This carbonation process can be tracked using seismic data through observed velocity changes. Our focus is on basalts primarily composed of minerals like iron, calcium, and magnesium, with an initial assumption of water-filled pore spaces. The mineralization process is modeled to predict the volume of cement formed and the associated decrease in porosity. We use a patchy cement model to calculate the velocities over time as CO2 is injected. Our example includes two phases: a one-week CO2 injection period followed by 29 weeks of frame cementation. After the first week, CO2 replaces water, leading to a reduction in density and P-wave velocity, while cementation results in increased bulk density and P-wave velocity, and a decrease in porosity and surface area. Therefore, this is the first study to directly link carbon mineralization's impact on seismic properties.</description>

                Summary This study introduces an innovative approach to carbon capture and storage (CCS) site monitoring by integrating DeepNRMS, an unsupervised deep learning method, with t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). Focusing on the Aquistore CO2 storage site, the research utilizes DeepNRMS to manage seismic time-lapse noise and improve accuracy in identifying CO2 plumes. The method employs pre-injection seismic images for training, analyzing embedding spaces using t-SNE to track the model's learning progression. By evaluating distances within this space, DeepNRMS demonstrates increased precision over traditional NRMS in filtering noise and highlighting CO2-induced signal changes. The study also details the application of t-SNE for dimensionality reduction, mapping high-dimensional data from the DeepNRMS encoder into a two-dimensional space to visualize and validate the model's performance. The results, particularly in different stages of CO2 injection at the Aquistore site, illustrate the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between noise and actual CO2 plumes.</description>

                Importance Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from health care are substantial and disproportionately harm persons with cancer. Emissions from a central component of oncology care, outpatient clinician visits, are not well described, nor are the reductions in emissions and human harms that could be obtained through decentralizing this aspect of cancer care (ie, telemedicine and local clinician care when possible). Objective To assess potential reductions in GHG emissions and downstream health harms associated with telemedicine and fully decentralized cancer care. Design, Setting, and Participants This population-based cohort study and counterfactual analyses using life cycle assessment methods analyzed persons receiving cancer care at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute between May 2015 and December 2020 as well as persons diagnosed with cancer over the same period from the Cancer in North America (CiNA) public dataset. Data were analyzed from October 2023 to April 2024. Main Outcomes and Measures The adjusted per&#8211;visit day difference in GHG emissions in kilograms of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) equivalents between 2 periods: an in-person care model period (May 2015 to February 2020; preperiod) and a telemedicine period (March to December 2020; postperiod), and the annual decrease in disability-adjusted life-years in a counterfactual model where care during the preperiod was maximally decentralized nationwide. Results Of 123 890 included patients, 73 988 (59.7%) were female, and the median (IQR) age at first diagnosis was 59 (48-68) years. Patients were seen over 1.6 million visit days. In mixed-effects log-linear regression, the mean absolute reduction in per&#8211;visit day CO 2 equivalent emissions between the preperiod and postperiod was 36.4 kg (95% CI, 36.2-36.6), a reduction of 81.3% (95% CI, 80.8-81.7) compared with the baseline model. In a counterfactual decentralized care model of the preperiod, there was a relative emissions reduction of 33.1% (95% CI, 32.9-33.3). When demographically matched to 10.3 million persons in the CiNA dataset, decentralized care would have reduced national emissions by 75.3 million kg of CO 2 equivalents annually; this corresponded to an estimated annual reduction of 15.0 to 47.7 disability-adjusted life-years. Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study found that using decentralization through telemedicine and local care may substantially reduce cancer care&#8217;s GHG emissions; this corresponds to small reductions in human mortality.</description>

      <title>Re-Assessment of Cyclic Co2 Injection for Enhanced Oil Recovery and Co2 Storage in Unconventional Reservoirs Integrating Multi-Geomechanical and Multi-Geochemical Impacts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4848211</link>
      <description>Xun Hu, Bing Wei, Runxue Mao, Heng Wang, Jun Lu, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399163329

                Cyclic CO2 injection holds great potential for enhanced oil recovery and CO2 storage (CCUS-EOR) in unconventional reservoirs, with major projects in progress worldwide. There, however, is a lack of thorough understanding of CO2 migration and evolution behaviors over cycles at a large scale, particularly considering multi-geomechanical and multi-geochemical impacts. In this work, the complex CO2-oil-brine-rock interactions and rock stress-sensitivity were integrated into a well-established three-dimensional microseismic model to account for the impacts of geomechanics and geochemistry. The reaction kinetics model related to mineral composition aids in well-capturing changes in the petrophysical properties of the reservoir under in-situ conditions. The objective is to re-assess the CCUS-EOR response of cyclic CO2 injection in a specific tight reservoir and gain a comprehensive understanding of the CO2 transport process. The re-assessment results indicated that the cyclic CO2 injection model with geophysical and geochemical effects notably raised the oil recovery by 3.4% of original oil in place (OOIP) after ten cycles, with 48% of the injected CO2 being stored underground. The occurrence of multiple CO2 storage impeded CO2-oil interaction, resulting in a reduction of 25.9% in the volume of the CO2-oil mixing zone and 2.2% in the cumulative oil production, yet a 7.7% increase in the storage rate. Cyclic injection mode exerted a significant impact on the migration and evolution of CO2 in the reservoir. CO2 dissolution in oil serves as the primary trapping mechanism, but it also contributes significantly to CO2 production. The residual gas is particularly influenced by well operations and predominantly trapped in the non-fracture zone of the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). After ten cycles, 20% of the injected CO2 (approximately 12,000 tons) was sequestered long-term through carbonate mineralization (6%), dissolution in connate water (6%), aqueous ions (4%), and trapped gas (4%). The mineral reaction rate was affected by intermittent operations, and the average matrix porosity and permeability induced by geochemical reactions were reduced by 0.61% and 1.62%, respectively. The results of this study supplement earlier findings in the CCUS-EOR dynamic process and offer guidance for maximizing EOR and long-term storage efficiency.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Sustainable Practices for Managing Residue Derived from Wheat Straw</title>

      <description>Harikishore Shanmugam, G.S.V. Raghavan, Rajinikanth Rajagopal, Bernard Goyette, Linxiang Lyu, Siyuan Zhou, Chunjiang An, Bioengineering. 11(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399174108

                Farm leftovers, particularly crop residues, are a key source of renewable energy in Canada. The nation&#8217;s robust agricultural industry provides ample biomass, derived from forestry and agriculture resources, for energy generation. Crop residues, such as straws and husks, play a crucial role in this biomass reservoir, contributing to biofuel production and greenhouse gas mitigation efforts. Focusing on supply chains, waste management, and emission reduction, this study evaluates the sustainability of wheat straw, an agricultural biomass by-product. The environmental issues of various approaches to managing agricultural biomass were explored. Following an evaluation of biomass features, conversion methods, and economic and environmental advantages, the results show anaerobic digestion to be the most sustainable approach. Four metrics were examined in relation to social elements, and numerous aspects were considered as inputs in the evaluation of transportation costs. The use of electric trucks versus fuel-based trucks resulted in an 18% reduction in total operating costs and a 58% reduction in consumption costs. This study examined CO2 emissions over four different transportation distances. The data indicate that a significant reduction of 36% in kg CO2 equivalent emissions occurred when the distance was lowered from 100 km to 25 km. These findings offer insights for creating practical plans that should increase the sustainability of agricultural biomass leftovers.</description>

      <title>The artificial neural network-based two-phase equilibrium calculation framework for fast compositional reservoir simulation of CO2 EOR</title>

                Injecting CO2 into the reservoir is an essential method for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) and enhanced oil recovery (EOR). However, due to the complex phase behavior between CO2 and hydrocarbons, the reservoir simulation of the injection process becomes time-consuming. To expedite phase equilibrium calculations (PECs) involved in CO2-EOR, we have developed an artificial neural network (ANN)-based PECs framework comprising the 1P-stability and 2P-flash models, which replaced traditional single-phase stability analysis and two-phase flash calculations. Additionally, We proposed a straightforward method for generating training points tailored to CO2-EOR production characteristics. Specific settings are placed on the two models to ensure a 100% correct solution, including predefining criteria to filter the stability model output and utilizing the flash model output as the standard algorithm initial value. We have enhanced the ANN-based models to integrate seamlessly with the compositional simulator. Four published fluids were selected to test this framework by implementing the standalone PECs, and one fluid was used for the simulation of CO2-EOR. The ANN-based framework can save up to 80% of time on phase equilibrium calculations, resulting in a 40% reduction in simulation time compared to the conventional algorithm. In summary, the newly developed ANN-based PECs framework shows great potential to accelerate the reservoir simulation for CO2-EOR, which helps design the program of CCUS by injecting CO2 into the reservoir.</description>

      <title>Simulated radiocarbon cycle revisited by considering the bipolar seesaw and benthic 14C data</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2024.118801</link>

                Carbon cycle models used to calculate the marine reservoir age of the non-polar surface ocean (called Marine20) out of IntCal20, the compilation of atmospheric &#916;14C, have so far neglected a key aspect of the millennial-scale variability connected with the thermal bipolar seesaw: changes in the strength of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) related to Dansgaard/Oeschger and Heinrich events. Here we implement such AMOC changes in the carbon cycle box model BICYCLE-SE to investigate how model performance over the last 55 kyr is affected, in particular with respect to available 14C and CO2 data. Constraints from deep ocean 14C data suggest that the AMOC in the model during Heinrich stadial 1 needs to be highly reduced or even completely shutdown. Ocean circulation and sea ice coverage combined are the processes that almost completely explain the simulated changes in deep ocean 14C age, and these are also responsible for a glacial drawdown of &#8764;60 ppm of atmospheric CO2. We find that the implementation of abrupt reductions in AMOC during Greenland stadials in the model setup that was previously used for the calculation of Marine20 leads to differences of less than &#177;100 14C yrs. The representation of AMOC changes therefore appears to be of minor importance for deriving non-polar mean ocean radiocarbon calibration products such as Marine20, where atmospheric carbon cycle variables are forced by reconstructions. However, simulated atmospheric CO2 exhibits minima during AMOC reductions in Heinrich stadials, in disagreement with ice core data. This mismatch supports previous suggestions that millennial-scale changes in CO2 were probably not driven directly by the AMOC, but rather by biological and physical processes in the Southern Ocean and by contributions from variable land carbon storage.</description>

      <title>Injectivity and Reactivity of Carbonated Water in Sandstone</title>

                Summary Injectivity problems can be very costly and the potential for formation damages should therefore be investigated for CO2 projects. The objective of the presented study was to evaluate the injectivity and reactivity of Carbonated Water (CW) in selected sandstone rock at reservoir conditions. Injectivity and reactivity of CW compared to Formation Water were investigated in flooding experiments in Bandera Gray plugs at 80&#176;C and 340 bar. Concentration of CO2 in the CW and the injection rates were varied. Little or no significant increase in differential pressure across plugs (dP) was measured during the flooding experiments, i.e. no or minor formation damage occurred especially at high injection rate. The low-rate floods had some reduction in the permeability depending on the CO2 concentration in CW. No fines were observed in effluent samples. The reactivity of the plugs and CW can be understood from the effluent ion compositions. Most of the effluent ion concentrations were stable with CW injection, however excess Magnesium and Iron ions were produced from the plugs. It is concluded that CW injectivity and reactivity should be investigated by varying CO2 concentration in CW and injection rates.</description>

      <title>Selection of sheep skin bacteria to reduce blood-feeding by biting midges under laboratory conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.30.596646</link>

                Biting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are of huge veterinary importance, mainly as vectors of pathogens, such as Bluetongue virus. Currently, there are no effective methods to protect animals against biting midges since insecticides have limited or short-lived efficacy. Biting midges are attracted to hosts by carbon dioxide and by their body odours, which are mainly produced by skin bacteria. In humans, it has been shown that differences in attractiveness between individuals to mosquitoes is mediated by these skin bacterial volatiles. This opens the possibility to protect individuals from biting insects by supplementing their skin microbiome with probiotics. In this study, we investigated this approach by culturing sheep skin bacteria on different media and assessed their effects against field-caught Culicoides (overwhelmingly Obsoletus group species) as well as laboratory-reared Culicoides nubeculosus (Meigen). Aerococcus urinaeeequi, Bacillus safensis, Bacillus subtilis, Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, Micrococcus sp. and Staphylococcus equorum were selected to be tested in a dual-choice Y-tube olfactometer, assessing their behavioural effects towards biting midges. We revealed an avoidance effect towards laboratory-reared C. nubeculosus when testing B. safensis (P &#8804; 0.001) and B. subtilis (P &#8804; 0.001). Bacillus safensis (P = 0.006) and Micrococcus sp. (P &#8804; 0.001) yielded significant repellent potential towards field-caught Culicoides. These two candidates were subsequently tested in a membrane blood feeding assay. When the bacterial species B. safensis was applied to the membrane, a feeding reduction of 83 % was observed with field-caught Culicoides.</description>

      <title>Application of Flotation for Removing Barium(II) Ions Using Ionized Acyclic Polyethers in the Context of Sustainable Waste Management</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114665</link>
      <description>Agnieszka Sobianowska-Turek, Katarzyna Grudniewska, A. Fornalczyk, J. Willner, W. Bialik, Weronika Urba&#324;ska, Anna Janda, Sustainability. 16(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399172384

                Energy transition is one of the basic actions taken to counteract and prevent climate change. The basic assumption of energy-related changes is its sustainable use according to the closed-loop model, as well as moving away from fossil fuels, in particular from coal, the combustion of which contributes to excessive harmful carbon dioxide emissions. One of the most popular solutions towards green energy is nuclear energy. Its use allows for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions harmful to the environment and climate, but it also involves the generation of radioactive waste that requires appropriate processing. This paper presents the results of the flotation removal of barium(II) ions from a dilute aqueous solution using ionized acyclic polyethers. The basic factors determining the efficiency and kinetics of the process were defined. It has been shown that as the acidity of the attached polyether molecules increases: the flotation rate constant 1 (0.1667 min&#8722;1) &lt; 3 (0.2468 min&#8722;1) &lt; 2 (0.3616 min&#8722;1) and the separation degree Ba2+: 1 (86.8%) &lt; 3 (99.3%) &lt; 2 (99.4%). The presented results of ion flotation tests may facilitate the collective or selective separation of radioactive isotopes, i.e., Cs-137, Sr-90, Ba-133 and Co-60, from radioactive wastewater in the future. The results of the experimental work described in the article can also be used to develop individual processes for separating mixtures of radioactive isotopes (radioactive wastewater) into individual components (isotopes) and subjecting them to subsequent transformation processes. The obtained results allow us to claim that the tested organic compounds can be used in the future in the selective treatment of hazardous wastewater, which will translate into a reduction in unit costs of industrial processes. The selective recovery of individual pollutants is the basis for the next step in waste management, i.e., designing a cheap method of waste disposal, which also directly affects the economics of the process and its use in industrial conditions.</description>

      <title>Effect of Algal Biomass on the Properties of Calcium Sulfoaluminate Cement</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c01007</link>

                Calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement is a low-CO2 alternative to portland cement (OPC). To further enhance its sustainability, the use of CO2-storing algal biomass and algal biochar was explored herein as carbon-negative cement retarding admixtures. CSA cement was replaced with 0, 5, 10, or 15% raw algal biomass or biochar derived from the raw algal biomass. Results showed that increasing raw algae dosage led to longer delays in hydration; however, the retardation effect was not observed in samples containing algal biochar due to the absence of hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups in biochar. Delays in cement hydration due to the incorporation of raw algal biomass corresponded to lower compressive strengths, as anticipated. Despite these reductions, the compressive strengths of the CSA cement pastes were similar to the control OPC pastes due to the inherently high initial compressive strengths of CSA cement compared to OPC. Both raw algae and biochar effectively lowered the net CO2 emissions of CSA and OPC, with biochar samples exhibiting lower CO2 emissions relative to raw algae when normalized for strength performance. Overall, the results suggest that algae may be used effectively with CSA cement for a more workable and sustainable binder system.</description>

      <title>Using CSEM for CCUS Fluid Monitoring: Examples and Applications</title>

                Summary Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS) is a pillar of the energy transition. Two key technical elements are CO2 containment (seal integrity) and storage volumes (dynamic fluid plume) requiring geophysical monitoring. Over the past years, we carried out various electromagnetic surface monitoring surveys. When using the right workflow we can obtain surface data that is reconciled to borehole log scale. This makes the data certifiable in that context. For one application, the storage reservoir is a saline aquifer, we used Controlled Source ElectroMagnetics (CSEM) combined with magnetotellurics (MT) to obtain the background geologic structure. It included a high-power CSEM transmitter (200 KVA) and multi-component receivers to see resistive and conductive strata. Presently, we prepare for CO2 to be stored in basalt formation, where it solidifies. When CO2 is injected into basalt, it is first gaseous or liquid phase (pressure dependent) which causes a reduction in resistivity of the basalt reservoir followed by a strong resistivity increase when it solidifies. Another application is to contain CO2 under hydrocarbon reservoirs associated with salt dome provinces. We verified CSEM imaging over various salt domes to image the reservoir boundaries accurately.</description>

                Summary Carbon capture and storage is one of the key elements of atmospheric greenhouse gas reduction. Carbon storage projects often explore areas where little data exist. Faults in the storage complex impact on the migration and retention of CO2 plumes, CO2 injectivity, and the pressure propagation in the larger aquifer. Using a global database of core plug samples from hydrocarbon exploration and production, where mercury injection capillary entry pressure measurements are available for host rock - fault rock pairs in faulted reservoir sandstones, a statistical analysis of capillary entry pressure increase and permeability decrease from host to fault rock is presented. The analysis intends to provide a realistic range of host to fault rock multipliers for modeling purposes. It is found that the deformation mechanism, which is a function of burial depth at the time of faulting, plays a larger role than the clay content of the sample. Cataclasites in pure sandstones, phyllosilicate framework fault rocks, and clay smears all have very similar median values of capillary entry pressure increase and permeability reduction, compared to their respective host reservoir rocks. Disaggregation zones are the only fault rocks that deviate from this trend.</description>

      <title>Energy prediction for future energy supply in electrical vehicles</title>

                The carbon dioxide emission due to fuel-based vehicle transportation was greatly reduced by the usage of electric vehicles (EVs). The energy management of battery systems in EV plays a vital role in the development of modern vehicles. The consumption of energy by EVs depends on vehicle parameters and path details. By monitoring these parameters, the energy prediction models are developed to predict future energy consumption, which increases the vehicle performance, and to avoid driver's range anxiety problems. Artificial intelligence (AI) helps to develop sophisticated energy prediction models in EV systems. The machine learning (ML) algorithms are harnessed to predict future energy requirements based on the vehicle's prior details. Recurrent neural network algorithms and sequence-based ML algorithms are effectively forecasting required energy in EV models. In this proposed work, a sequence-based hybrid deep ML algorithm is employed because of its ability to intricate relationships within the dataset. Long-short-term memory and gated recurrent unit algorithms are bootstrap aggregated to make a hybrid bagging deep ML model. The model is developed using an EV model BMWi3 driving trips dataset. The EV dataset is preprocessed using the dimensionality reduction method. The random forest-based feature selection algorithm is used to achieve dimensionality reduction. The details of the EV vehicle's battery current, battery voltage, driving velocity, electric motor torque, elevation of the road, throttle, environmental temperature, and battery state of charge are selected as important features to model the dataset for AI model training. The model is validated by a fivefold cross-validation method. The results reveal that the predicted energy consumption values are nearly equal to the original energy consumed values. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The MSE of the proposed prediction algorithm is achieved as 0.20%, and the MAE is achieved as 0.4%. The results show that the proposed model can be implemented in hardware for the design of an effective energy management system in modern EVs to retrieve the issue of driver anxiety and improve performance.</description>

                Summary In response to the need for effective CO2 emission reduction to meet climate targets, the Danish government is actively identifying and evaluating potential Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) sites. The study focuses on the Upper Triassic-Jurassic Gassum and Fjerritslev formations in the Danish Basin, employing forward stratigraphic modeling to characterize reservoir-seal combinations with limited data. Two potential onshore sites for CO2 storage were identified through a basin-scale model, considering factors such as pressure, temperature, and porosity. The study involved calibration using well and field data to create a reference basin model, serving as the initial state for subsequent CO2 injection simulations. Four injection scenarios were tested, ranging from 30Mt to 150Mt per injection spot over 60 years, with plume evolution monitored for 3000 years. The results indicated effective containment within the Gassum Formation during injection and the relaxation phase. However, increased aquifer pressure within a 130 km radius raised concerns about associated risks and necessitates further studies to derisk CCS operations.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Seepage Mechanism of Nanofluids Assistant Co2 Aerosol Foam System Flooding after Water Flooding</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4852409</link>
      <description>Xiangyu Wang, Chenwei Liu, Jiacheng Nie, Chenru Zhou, Chuixiu Huang, &#1051;&#1080;&#1085;&#1075; &#1051;&#1086;&#1085;&#1075;, Mingzhong Li, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399311111

                CO2 foam (CF) flooding is an effective method for enhancing oil recovery (EOR) in late-stage water drive reservoirs. However, inadequate mixing of CO2 and foaming agent solution during the injection process leads to the formation of uneven and unstable foam, thereby limited the efficient development of water drive reservoirs. Herein, we report a novel CO2 aerosol foam system (CAFS) generated by a custom-built aerosol foam generator. The CAFS development performance was systematically analyzed after water flooding and investigate the affecting factors about gas-liquid ratio, pre-injection volume, and solution concentration using flooding experiments. Evaluation parameters such as recovery, water cut, differential pressure, and resistance coefficient are employed. Additionally, we examine the microscopic EOR mechanism of CAFS through visualized microscopic flooding experiments. The results reveal that CAFS exhibits better development performance compared to conventional CF flooding. This improvement is attributed to enhanced rock wettability by hydrophobic nanoparticles and the high resistance coefficient of aerosol foam, both of which contribute significantly to the superior oil production performance of CAFS. Microscopic experiments demonstrate that CO2 aerosol generates more uniform foam and effectively expands the sweep area through trapping effects, superimposed Jamin effects, and squeezing occupation in pore throats. Moreover, the emulsification capability of nanofluid-SDS solution and viscosity reduction of oil due to dissolved CO2 after foam breakdown in the matrix further facilitate oil recovery, where the remained oil is recovered as foamy oil driven by the subsequently injected fluid.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Analyzable Solutions for Left-Turn-Centered Congestion Problems in Urban Grid Networks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114777</link>
      <description>Taraneh Ardalan, Denis Sarazhinsky, Nemanja Dobrota, Aleksandar Stevanovic, Sustainability. 16(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399321298

                Traffic congestion caused by left-turning vehicles in a coordinated corridor is a multifaceted problem requiring tailored solutions. This study explores the impact of shared left-turn lanes within one-way couplets, particularly during peak hours, where high left-turn volumes, limited side street storage, and the overlapped green time between pedestrians and left-turners contribute to queue spillbacks, coordination interruption, and network congestion. The focus of this paper is on the solutions that can be easily analyzed by practitioners, here called &#8220;analyzable solutions&#8221;. This approach stands in contrast to solutions derived from &#8220;non-transparent&#8221; optimization tools, which do not allow for a clear assessment of the solution&#8217;s adequacy or the ability to predict its impact in real-world applications. This paper investigates the effects of employing two analyzable signal timing strategies: Lagging Pedestrian (LagPed) phasing and Left-Turn Progression (LTP) offsets. Using high-fidelity microsimulation, the authors evaluated different scenarios, assessing pedestrian delays, queue lengths, travel time index, area average travel time index, and environmental impacts such as Fuel Consumption (FC) and CO2 emissions. The effectiveness of the proposed strategies was comprehensively evaluated against the base case scenario, demonstrating considerable improvements in various performance measures, including approximately a 5% reduction in FC and CO2 emissions. Implementation of the LTP strategy alone yields substantial reductions in delays, the number of stops, the queue length for left-turning vehicles, travel times for all road users, and ultimately FC and CO2 emissions. This study offers innovative approach to addressing the complex and multifaceted problem of left-turn-centered congestion in urban grid networks using efficient and down-to-earth analyzable solutions.</description>

      <title>Delayed effects of air pollution on public bike-sharing system use in Seoul, South Korea: A time series analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2024.117030</link>

                As a complementary means to urban public transit systems, public bike-sharing provides a green and active mode of sustainable mobility, while reducing carbon-dioxide emissions and promoting health. There has been increasing interest in factors affecting bike-sharing usage, but little is known about the effect of ambient air pollution. To assess the short-term impact of daily exposure to multiple air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3) on the public bike-sharing system (PBS) usage in Seoul, South Korea (2018--2021), we applied a quasi-Poisson generalized linear model combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM). The model was adjusted for day of the week, holiday, temperature, relative humidity, and long-term trend. We also conducted stratification analyses to examine the effect modification by age group, seasonality, and COVID-19. We found that there was a negative association between daily ambient air pollution and the PBS usage level at a single lag day 1 (i.e., air quality a day before the event) across all four pollutants. Our results suggest that days with high levels of air pollutants (at 95th percentile) are associated with 0.91% (0.86% to 0.96%) for PM2.5, 0.89% (0.85% to 0.94%) for PM10, 0.87% (0.82% to 0.91%) for O3, 0.92% (0.87% to 0.98%) for NO2, reductions in cycling behavior in the next day compared to days with low levels of pollutants (at 25th percentile). No evidence of effect modification was found by seasonality, age nor the COVID-19 pandemic for any of the four pollutants. Our findings suggest that high concentrations of ambient air pollution are associated with decreased rates of PBS usage on the subsequent day regardless of the type of air pollutant measured.</description>

                Abstract. The rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) would decrease in response to decrease of anthropogenic emissions or cessation (net zero emissions) is of great scientific and societal interest. Such decrease in atmospheric CO2 on the centennial scale would be due essentially entirely to transfer of carbon into the world ocean (WO) and the terrestrial biosphere (TB), which are sink compartments on this time scale. The rate of decrease of excess atmospheric CO2 and the apportionment of this decrease into the two sink compartments has been examined in two prior model intercomparison studies, subsequent either to a pulse emission of CO2 or to abrupt cessation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The present study examines and quantifies inter-model anticorrelation in those studies in the net rate and extent of uptake of CO2 into the two sink compartments. Specifically, in each study the time-dependent coefficients characterizing the net transfer rate into the two sink compartments, (evaluated as the net transfer rate normalized to excess atmospheric CO2 above pre-pulse amount, for the pulse experiment; or as the net transfer rate divided by excess atmospheric CO2 above preindustrial amount, for the abrupt cessation experiment) was found to exhibit strong anticorrelation across the participating models. That is, models for which the normalized rate of uptake into the WO was high exhibited low uptake rate into the TB, and vice versa. This anticorrelation in net transfer rate results in anticorrelation in net uptake extent into the two compartments that is substantially greater than would be expected simply from competition for excess CO2 between the two sink compartments. This anticorrelation, which is manifested in diminished inter-model diversity, can lead to artificially enhanced confidence in current understanding of the consequences of potential future reductions of CO2 emissions and in the global warming potentials of non-CO2 greenhouse gases relative to that of CO2.</description>

      <title>Adjusting the phase transition time node of a solid&#8211;liquid biphasic solvent based on 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol for efficient CO2 capture: Insight into the regulatory effect of aminoethylethanolamine</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2024.128149</link>
      <description>Xiaobin Zhou, Ting Zou, Wei Wang, Zhifang Tu, Yinming Fan, Jianwen Wei, Lei Liao, Zongqiang Zhu, Yinian Zhu, Dunqiu Wang, Guohua Jing, Separation and purification technology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399243375

                Solid-liquid biphasic solvents (SLBSs) hold promise as energy-efficient candidates for CO2 capture. Nevertheless, the premature phase transition of current SLBSs leads to inopportune solid precipitation, posing operational challenges for the CO2 capture system. This study proposed a promising strategy that using aminoethylethanolamine (AEEA) as a regulator to fine-tune the phase transition time node of the 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP)/N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) SLBS, enabling the phase transition to occur precisely as desired. Experimental results showed that the AEEA/AMP/NMP (A/A/N) SLBS exhibited tunable phase transition time nodes, modulated by the concentration of AEEA. Specifically, with the addition of 0.2 mol&#183;L&#8722;1 AEEA, the CO2 loading associated with the phase transition increased significantly, from 0.19 to 0.54 mol&#183;mol&#8722;1, approaching the saturation loading of 0.57 mol&#183;mol&#8722;1. The delayed phase transition would facilitate the CO2 absorption operation. The regulatory mechanism of AEEA on the phase transition were thoroughly studied via 13C NMR and quantum calculations. AMP reacted with CO2 to produce AMPCOO&#8722; and AMPH+, which had a significantly stronger affinity for each other than for the solvent NMP, mediated by strong hydrogen bond interactions. Consequently, the continuous and fast aggregation of AMPCOO&#8722; and AMPH+ caused their swift precipitation from NMP. With the introduction of AEEA, the derived product AEEAH+(S)COO&#8211;(P) acted as a bridge-builder, connecting AMPCOO&#8722; or AMPH+ and NMP via hydrogen bonds, increasing the solubility of the AMP-derived products in NMP, thus effectively delaying the phase transition. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the A/A/N SLBS exhibited a total regeneration energy consumption of 1.94 GJ&#183;ton&#8722;1 CO2, representing a significant reduction of 48.9 % compared to that of 30 wt% MEA. This study provided a novel idea for designing SLBSs with controllable phase transition behavior, and offered a promising A/A/N SLBS for energy-efficient CO2 capture.</description>

      <title>Pilot-scale study on combustion characteristics, slagging characteristics and flue gas composition of coal oilfield wastewater slurry</title>

                As the volume of oil extraction continues to rise, the issue of oilfield wastewater treatment has become increasingly urgent. Traditional water treatment technologies struggle to effectively and economically eliminate the pollution caused by oilfield wastewater, as well as efficiently utilize its various components. This study proposes the utilization of oilfield wastewater for the preparation of coal water slurry, and the combustion experiments of coal oilfield wastewater slurry (COWS) and original coal water slurry (CWS) under various working conditions are conducted on a pilot-scale horizontal furnace. The investigation focused on the combustion characteristics, slagging characteristics and flue gas composition, as these indicators directly impact the industrial application of such slurry fuel. The combustion characteristics results reveal that both COWS and CWS demonstrate stable ignition and combustion across all working conditions, with combustion efficiency exceeding 99.69%, and the incorporation of oilfield wastewater promotes volatiles precipitation and combustion. The slagging characteristics results indicate that the flame temperature within the furnace is critical in determining slagging occurrence, and the incorporation of oilfield wastewater increases the likelihood of slagging. The flue gas composition measurement results indicate that the incorporation of oilfield wastewater slightly elevates carbon monoxide (CO) levels, albeit within a low concentration range. Additionally, oilfield wastewater demonstrates a modest reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. These test results underscore that incorporating oilfield wastewater into the preparation of fuel coal water slurry not only facilitates thorough treatment of oilfield wastewater, but also enhance the combustion performance of slurry fuel within the furnace, thereby offering significant industrial application potential.</description>

                The reduction of CO2 emissions is a critical challenge on which scientific research is mainly focused on recent times. The study represents an innovative method to utilize the strong computational power of CMG-GEM the numerical reservoir simulator coupled with the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict carbon storage and sequestration capacity in saline aquifers. The key parameters in geological storage formations are identified, by generating a diverse dataset from CMG-GEM simulation runs by varying the different geological and operational parameters such as injector bottom hole pressure (BHP), injection rate, aquifer thickness, aquifer volume, hysteresis factor, porosity, reservoir pressure vertical and horizontal permeability. Robust Data analysis was done to understand the effects of these parameters and access the different CO2 trapping mechanism types including structural, dissolved, mineral, and aqueous ions states. The generated dataset was used in the MATLAB neural network toolbox to develop an ANN model for CO2 storage and sequestration prediction across various trapping mechanisms. Rigorous testing and validation processes are performed to optimize the ANN model resulting in an accuracy of 98% using the best algorithm. The high accuracy reflects the model's reliability in evaluating the CO2 storage and sequestration in saline aquifers. Furthermore, the simulation and ANN hybrid approach was not only considered a successful and innovative technical solution but also addresses a way to optimize and minimize the time of CO2 subsurface storage evaluation as the ANN model can deliver very accurate results from relatively minimal simulation runs. Therefore, it was significantly reduced the number of simulations runs which requires high computational power and long simulation running time.</description>

                Summary To meet emissions reductions targets by mid-century, dozens of geological CO2 storage projects are currently being developed in the offshore UK. Many of these are in the Southern North Sea, targeting the large saline aquifers in the Bunter sandstone. To design and operate these projects effectively, seismicity rates need to be accurately characterised. Measuring seismicity can provide insights into the stress state in the region, fault density and faulting style, as well as fracturing in the overburden. Understanding background seismicity is also key to discriminating and determining the risk of induced seismicity that could result from injection. To significantly improve the detection of smaller events in the Southern North Sea region, we have deployed a dense array of three-component broadband sensors on the North York Moors ( Figure 1 ). Using this data and beamforming methods, we have more accurately characterised earthquake rates in the Southern North Sea, informing the development of CO2 storage operations in the region. Telemetry systems have also been deployed, showing that onshore dense arrays could act as a cost effective, real time, continuous monitoring method of the reservoir response to CO2 injection.</description>

                Ternary Cu/Zn/ZrO2 catalysts prepared recently using atomic layer deposition (ALD) have shown increased performance toward methanol synthesis. In the present computational study, we have investigated the structure, composition, and stability of various zinc- and copper-containing subnano size species on a zirconia support. Density functional theory calculations with minima hopping were used to sample the positioning and geometry of supported ZnxCuyOz structures up to 8 metal atoms in total. ZnO monomeric species were found to be energetically more favorable than small clusters, which could suggest a resistance to initial stage agglomeration. Ab-initio thermodynamics revealed that under typical methanol synthesis conditions, the complete reduction of ZnO and mixed ZnO/Cu clusters is unfavorable. The investigated ZnO monomers and clusters are able to provide CO2 activation sites, with the Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 triple interface offering the best stabilization for the adsorbed CO2. All in all, the findings suggest that small ZnO species generated by ALD could be stabilized by the zirconia component, while contact with copper species at the interface benefits CO2 activation.</description>

      <title>Core-in-shell, glucose-templated, ZrO2-stabilized calcium/copper-based pellets with robust CO2 capture performance for Ca/Cu process</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2024.128241</link>
      <description>Jian Chen, Weimin Xia, Huiping Tang, Anqi Huang, Changqiang Huang, Y. Li, Yuxin Jiang, Zhicheng Wang, Yu Gu, Bin Qi, Separation and purification technology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399207529

                Calcium/copper-based pellets are crucial to the advancement of the Ca/Cu process, as CuO reduction provides the heat necessary for CaCO3 calcination. Yet, a significant challenge lies in preserving their CO2 capture performance, which tends to deteriorate rapidly. Thus in this study, we proposed a two-stage method to synthesize core-in-shell, glucose-templated, ZrO2-stabilized calcium/copper-based pellets that are highly efficient at capturing CO2. The designed pellets featured a core concentrated with CaO and CuO, surrounded by an outer shell of ZrO2. Initially, different particle size ranges of unstabilized calcium/copper-based pellets were fabricated, including 200&#8211;470, 210&#8211;600, 400&#8211;890, and 800&#8211;1090 &#956;m. A minor improvement in CO2 capture performance was observed with decreasing particle sizes, ranging from 0.16 to 0.20 gCO2/gmaterial. However, a noticeable decline in CO2 capture performance was observed in these unstabilized calcium/copper-based pellets during cycling. To address this issue, these pellets were then coated with a ZrO2 shell. The core-in-shell, ZrO2-stabilized calcium/copper-based pellets possessed much-improved CO2 sorption stability, mainly due to that the ZrO2 shell mitigated the degradation of the pore structure resulting from sintering during cycling. Finally, glucose was incorporated as a pore-forming material into the core-in-shell, ZrO2-stabilized calcium/copper-based pellets, improving the pore structure and further boosting their reactivity. The incorporation of glucose proved to be beneficial, resulting in enhanced capacity and stability for CO2 sorption for the core-in-shell, glucose-templated, ZrO2-stabilized calcium/copper-based pellets. The best-performing sample, i.e., calcium/copper-based pellets with the simultaneous coating of a ZrO2 shell and the incorporation of glucose, demonstrated a sorption capacity of 0.26 gCO2/gmaterial in the initial cycle. This capacity decreased to 0.18 gCO2/gmaterial in the tenth cycle, retaining 70 % of its initial reactivity.</description>

                The scale of offshore wind energy has been rapidly growing worldwide in recent years. Accurate assessment of the offshore wind energy potential and emission reduction benefits is essential to realize the ambitious targets for future installations. In this study, the Shandong Sea of China was selected as a case study, and the long-term offshore wind energy potential was assessed using ERA5 reanalysis data for the last 30 years, including the spatio-temporal variation and the technical potential of wind resources. An innovative approach to evaluate the technical potential of installed offshore wind farms based on deep learning, satellite images and ERA5 reanalysis data was proposed and applied to the Shandong Sea. The results show that (1) the highest offshore wind energy potential is observed in the northeast sea of Weihai; (2) the inter-annual variation of wind resources is relatively modest, with a pronounced monthly variability. The richest wind resources are found in the spring; (3) the electricity generation of wind resources is 12.66&#8764;30.53 GWh/year, equivalent to a reduction of 9.35&#8764;22.55 Kt of CO2 emissions; (4) as of 2023, there were 12 OWFs including 633 offshore wind turbines in Shandong Sea, generating 14,218 GWh/year of clean electricity and reducing 10,505 Kt/year of CO2 emissions. The method proposed in this study is applicable to both small- and large-scale areas and allows for an accurate assessment of the electricity generation from installed offshore wind farms.</description>

      <title>Investigation of microstructure evolution and redox behavior of Ni-GDC cermet by cyclic re-oxidation in CO2</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.05.478</link>
      <description>Yang Sun, Yanan Hou, Xiaofeng Guo, Huiying Qi, Ding Rong Ou, Peng Qiu, Tonghuan Zhang, Di Liu, Shuna Han, Baofeng Tu, International journal of hydrogen energy. 72(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399321601

                The microstructure and reactivity of Ni-GDC cermet under cyclic oxidation in CO2 conditions were investigated using temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The XRD results revealed that NiO was formed during the re-oxidation process in CO2. SEM and TPR results demonstrated that nanostructured NiO aggregates were formed on the surface of the sample after being re-oxidized at 400 &#176;C for 1200 min, resulting in an &#945; peak with high reduction activity and a conversion of only 16% from Ni to NiO. In contrast, the samples re-oxidized at 600 &#176;C for 600 min and 800 &#176;C for 240 min were completely oxidized, resulting in reconstructed and sintered NiO with larger particle size, and a &#946; peak with lower reactivity and a conversion of 100%. Redox cycling was further conducted on completely oxidized samples, which showed a decrease in &#946; peak temperature from the first to seventh cycle. The migration and redistribution of sintered NiO towards the exterior were confirmed by comparing SEM images after the first and fourth cycles, which favored an increase in the reactive area. Therefore, this study reveals that lower re-oxidation temperatures (&#8804;400 &#176;C) and an appropriate increase in redox cycles are beneficial for forming surficial nanostructures while hindering the formation of large sintered NiO particles.</description>

      <title>Supercritical CO2 Extraction of Terpenoids from Indocalamus latifolius Leaves: Optimization, Purification, and Antioxidant Activity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/foods13111719</link>
      <description>Y. Chen, Yanbin Wang, Li He, Liling Wang, Jingzhe Zhao, Zongming Yang, Li Q, Rui Shi, Foods. 13(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399174807

                This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) extraction in enhancing the extraction rate, purity, and antioxidant activity of Indocalamus latifolius (Keng) McClure (Poaceae) leaf terpenoids (ILLTs). Crude extracts obtained from leaves were subjected to qualitative and quantitative analyses, revealing neophytadiene, phytol, &#946;-sitosterol, &#946;-amyrone, squalene, and friedelin as the primary terpenoid constituents, identified through gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Compared with steam distillation extraction (SD), simultaneous distillation extraction (SDE), ultra-high pressure-assisted n-hexane extraction (UHPE-Hex), ultra-high pressure-assisted ethanol extraction (UHPE-EtOH), ultrasound-assisted n-hexane extraction (UE-Hex), and ultrasound-assisted ethanol extraction (UE-EtOH), SC-CO2 exhibited a superior ILLT extraction rate, purity, and antioxidant activity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations of the residues further revealed more severe damage to both the residues and their cell walls after SC-CO2 extraction. Under optimal parameters (4.5 h, 26 MPa, 39 &#176;C, and 20% ethyl alcohol), the ILLT extraction rate with SC-CO2 reached 1.44 &#177; 0.12 mg/g, which was significantly higher than the rates obtained by the other six methods. The subsequent separation and purification using WelFlash C18-l, BUCHI-C18, and Sephadex LH-20 led to an increase in the purity of the six terpenoid components from 12.91% to 93.34%. Furthermore, the ILLTs demonstrated cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells with an IC50 value of 148.93 &#177; 9.93 &#956;g/mL. Additionally, with increasing concentrations, the ILLTs exhibited an enhanced cellular antioxidant status, as evidenced by reductions in both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels.</description>

      <title>The Intraday Impacts of Wind Energy on Wholesale Electricity Prices and Carbon Emissions in Great Britain</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4852343</link>
      <description>Huang Xiao, Xiaoyi Mu, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399310636

                This paper studies the intra-day impacts of wind power on wholesale electricity prices and carbon emissions in Great Britain. Exploiting hourly variations across years from 2008 to 2019, we differentiate the longer-term impact of wind power, largely due to capacity increases, and the short-term impact driven by weather conditions. The results show that the expansion of wind energy significantly decreases wholesale electricity prices in most hours, although the effect is not uniform. The prices decrease more during peak hours than during off-peak hours, with no significant effect during the ramping-up and ramping-down hours. However, over the sample period, the negative effects of wind expansion and load reduction on wholesale electricity prices are more than offset by the increases in carbon and fuel prices. Wind expansion, load reduction, and increases in carbon prices all contributed to the significant reduction in CO2 emissions.</description>

                In this study, we synthesize a series of active Ni3Co&#8211;Al2O3 catalysts, calcined at 850 &#176;C for 5 h, to examine the effects of (i) substituting Ni with Co on the catalytic performance of the Ni&#8211;Al2O3 catalyst and (ii) the total metal amount on the catalytic activity of Ni3Co&#8211;Al for the flue gas reforming of methane (FGRM) reaction at 600 &#176;C. We maintain high calcination temperatures to ensure strong alloy&#8211;support interactions. We also synthesize a Co&#8211;Al2O3 catalyst and use the data of a previously synthesized Ni&#8211;Al2O3 catalyst to analyze the effect of cobalt promotion. In the Ni3Co&#8211;Al catalysts, we maintain the Ni/Co ratio to be 3 and increase the Ni+Co amount from 5 to 25 wt % to examine the effect of total metal loading. The H2-reduction profiles reveal that the temperature where the consumption of H2 was maximum, Tmax temperature, is a function of the total metal loading. Comparison of the catalytic activities appears to suggest that in situ reduction of the catalyst at Tmax was better than the reduction at higher temperatures, since a larger number of surface active sites are available. The CH4 and CO2 conversions and H2 and CO yields increase when nickel is substituted with cobalt due to Ni&#8211;Co nanoalloy formation. However, the dispersion of the nanoalloy varies with the metal loading, and the optimum dispersion is when Ni+Co = 10 wt %. This 10Ni3Co&#8211;Al catalyst exhibits optimum CH4 (89%) and CO2 (30%) conversions and H2 (79%) and CO (46%) yields for the FGRM reaction at 600 &#176;C for a GHSV of 120,000 mL g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1. The conversions, yields, and particle size of the alloy of this 10Ni3Co&#8211;Al catalyst do not change significantly, and an insignificant amount of carbon is formed during 24 h of operation. Thus, after using a promoter, it is necessary to optimize the loading of the active phase to obtain the best catalyst for FGRM.</description>

                A 3D flower-like structure composed of porous bismuth oxychloride (p-BiOCl) nanosheets was synthesized through a hydrothermal process utilizing Bi(NO3)2, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and LiCl. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies confirmed the successful formation of the p-BiOCl. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were exploited to identify the nanosheet structure. The catalyst appeared as reduced Bi0 nanosheets at an applied cathodic potential of - 0.92 V (vs. RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode)). The maintenance of Bi nanosheet structures, controlled by the cationic surfactant of CTAB, resulted in enhanced electrochemical activity with a favorable Tafel slope and lower charge resistance. Defects of under-coordinated Bi sites and oxygen vacancy with interconnected 3D structures possess abundant active sites that further assist the activity. In 1.0 and 2.0 M KHCO3 electrolytes, the catalyst achieved a maximum current density of - 80 and 100 mA/cm2, respectively, at - 0.92 V (vs. RHE) with Faradaic efficiency &gt; 99% for converting CO2 to formate in H-cell electrolyzers. The substantial H/D kinetic isotope effect revealed from H2O versus D2O electrolytes, and the feature of bicarbonate concentration-dependent performance provided the mechanistic insights that bicarbonate intermediates are in equilibrium with CO2, activated by water, in the aqueous environment, together with the effects of electrode surface modulated by CTAB, are essential for the efficient electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction to formate.</description>

                The bonding effects between 3d transition&#8208;metal single sites and supports originate from crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE). The 3d transition&#8208;metal atoms of the spontaneous geometrical distortions, that is the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect, can alter CFSE, thereby leading to the Irving&#8208;Williams series. However, engineering single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) using the Irving&#8208;Williams series as an ideal guideline has not been reported to date. Herein, alkynyl&#8208;linked covalent phenanthroline frameworks (CPFs) with phenanthroline units are developed to anchor the desired 3d single metal ions from d5 to d10 (Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+). The Irving&#8208;Williams series was employed to accurately predict the bonding effects between 3d transition&#8208;metal atoms and phenanthroline units. To verify this, theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs exhibits higher stability and faster charge&#8208;transfer efficiency, far surpassing other metal&#8208;SASs/CPFs. As expected, Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs demonstrates a high photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO activity (~30.3 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1) and an exceptional photooxidation of CH3CHO&#8208;to&#8208;CH3COOH activity (~24.7 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1). Interestingly, the generated *O2&#8208; is derived from the process of CO2 reduction, thereby triggering a CH3CHO oxidation reaction. This work provides a novel design concept for designing SASs by the Irving&#8208;Williams to regulate the catalytic performances.</description>

      <title>Economic and Environmental Benefit Analysis between Crumb Rubber Concrete and Ordinary Portland Cement Concrete</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114758</link>

                Although manifold empirical studies have identified the mechanical properties of crumb rubber concrete (CRC), a comparative analysis of economic and environmental benefits between CRC and ordinary Portland cement concrete (OPCC) is not explored. In this paper, a quantitative meta-analysis between CRC and OPCC is conducted to explore optimized design strength, and a comparative analysis of the economic and environmental benefits of the two materials is undertaken. Considering cost price as the economic index and CO2 emissions per cubic meter of concrete as the environmental index in the materialization stage, CRC and OPCC were compared with different mix designs to achieve grades of similar strengths. Upon replacing less than 20% of natural fine aggregates in concrete with crumb rubber, while retaining the cement content, an increase of 6% in the cost price was achieved for CRC with 30&#8211;40 MPa strength grade. Apart from the aspect of mining and transportation of natural aggregates, the reduction of CO2 emissions by means of CRC adoption was verified in the treatment process of waste tire incineration. The results show that CO2 emissions from CRC decreased by 15&#8211;17% when compared with OPCC for 30~40 MPa grade concrete. The research conclusion can serve as a theoretical basis for the engineering application of CRC with the same strength, and make certain contributions to the industrial application of crumb rubber aggregates and the sustainable treatment of waste tires.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Energy Demand and Carbon Emission Reduction Potential of Singapore&#8217;s Future Road Transport Sector</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114754</link>
      <description>Shiddalingeshwar Channabasappa Devihosur, Anurag Chidire, Tobias Massier, Thomas Hamacher, Sustainability. 16(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399290302

                About 20% of the world&#8217;s CO2 emissions originate from transport. Many countries are committed to decarbonizing their transport sector. Singapore pledged to electrify a whole host of its land transportation fleet, which includes private cars, public buses, ride-hail vehicles, and motorcycles. This paper proposes a simple empirical framework to estimate the future energy demand after 100% electrification has been realized for nine selected road transport vehicle sub-classes and to calculate the carbon emission reduction potential based on various scenarios. The present energy demand for each vehicle sub-class is first calculated based on parameters like petrol and diesel consumption, heat value and density of petrol and diesel, population of vehicle type, and average mileage per vehicle sub-class. Several scenarios are presented, and an analysis is carried out to derive a range of emission factors which are used to estimate the carbon emission reduction potential. Relative to the present day, the future energy demand estimates reveal an overall reduction of 73.60%. Full electrification and a &#8220;clean&#8221; power generation mix could lead to an emission reduction as high as 93.64% across all vehicles sub-classes, with private cars having the highest reduction potential.</description>

      <title>Relation to Blood Chemistry and Acid-Base Balance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/med/9780197584569.003.0173</link>

                Abstract The physiologic mechanisms of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) buffering in relation to blood chemistry and acid-base balance are crucial in understanding the ventilatory response to metabolic derangements and induced changes in intracranial pressure (ICP). Hyperventilation is often used in the context of head trauma or neurosurgical procedures to reduce ICP; however, careful use of this technique is critical. Because non-ionized CO2 molecules, and not ionized molecules such as H+, are able to cross the blood-brain barrier, induced changes in cerebrovascular blood flow (CBF) are largely independent of systemic arterial pH. Due to compensatory mechanisms, CBF will return to baseline as both blood and CSF pH return to normal over 6&#8211;24 hours, regardless of continued hyperventilation. Preoperative communication with the neurosurgical team prior to procedure is key for planning any potential need for reduction in ICP to improve operative conditions. Postoperatively this return to baseline must be kept in mind as prolonged hyperventilation also results in increased &#8220;CO2 reactivity,&#8221; making the patient more susceptible to acute rises in ICP.</description>

      <title>EU ETS Market Expectations and Rational Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4848176</link>
      <description>Christoph Wegener, Robinson Kruse&#8208;Becher, Tony Klein, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399170291

                The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) aimed to combat CO2 emissions in Europe, but concerns arose during the third trading period (2013-2020) due to rising prices, sparking speculation about a potential price bubble, compromising the system's efficiency. Distorted price signals lead to suboptimal abatement choices by firms. We argue that (i) testing for rational bubbles based on transition costs, from cheap, polluting to costly, clean energy, is limited to scenarios of market certainty, which is unrealistic given evolving CO2 reduction measures, and (ii) defining fundamental value through switching costs lacks a singular approach, leading to inconclusive findings. As a more robust alternative, our study suggests testing for rational bubbles based on futures prices. This approach remains robust even with a trending risk premium component in the futures price. Empirical findings reveal no evidence of a rational bubble in the third or fourth trading period of the EU ETS.</description>

      <title>Economic sanctions, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions in Iran: a system dynamics model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1080/01442872.2024.2358842</link>

                Economic sanctions have the potential to affect environmental factors through various channels, including income reduction and constraints on accessing finance and environmentally friendly technologies. This study aims to simulate the energy and environmental consequences resulting from international sanctions in Iran. To achieve this, we develop a System Dynamics model integrating a spectrum of variables spanning economic, social, and environmental dimensions, for the period from 2008 to 2028. Our simulation outcomes indicate that by 2028, sanctions are anticipated to precipitate a notable upsurge in CO2 emissions, ranging from 12.5% to 30% compared to the baseline scenario. The magnitude of this escalation hinges on a variety of factors, including energy intensity and scenarios related to economic growth. According to our findings, prolonging international sanctions could be a major barrier to improving energy intensity and lowering CO2 emissions. Given the potential environmental consequences of sanctions, international communities, particularly sanctioning countries, should consider the environmental impacts of sanctions in their policy-making decisions in order to reduce emissions damage.</description>

      <title>Towards Sustainable Mobility: Assessing the Benefits and Implications of Internal Combustion Engine Vehicle Bans and Battery Electric Vehicle Uptake in Qatar</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos15060677</link>
      <description>Abdulla Alishaq, Daniel Mehlig, Atmosphere. 15(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399285817

                The global shift towards sustainable transportation, primarily through vehicle electrification, is critical in addressing climate change. Qatar presents a knowledge gap with specific challenges and opportunities in this transition. This study calculates the potential reduction in CO2-eq, NOx, and PM2.5 emissions resulting from substituting Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs) with Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in Qatar, considering ICEV ban scenarios in 2030, 2035, and 2040, alongside five policy pathways. A Vehicle Stock Model (VSM) simulates Qatar&#8217;s fleet evolution from 2022 to 2050, focusing on the vehicle&#8217;s operational phase. An ICEV ban in 2030 would result in a 34% cumulative emission reduction in road transport between 2022 and 2050 compared with the Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario. For NOx and PM2.5, cumulative emissions for the 2030 ICEV ban pathways are approximately 20% and 9% lower, respectively, compared with BAU. This study underscores the necessity of localising environmental strategies to meet Qatar&#8217;s specific needs and climate commitments, where results indicate significant emission reductions are possible through BEVs.</description>

      <title>Engineering Frustrated Lewis Pair Active Sites in Porous Organic Scaffolds for Catalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Hydrogenation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c01890</link>
      <description>Shubhajit Das, Rub&#233;n Laplaza, J. Terence Blaskovits, Cl&#233;mence Corminb&#339;uf, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399174013

                Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), featuring reactive combinations of Lewis acids and Lewis bases, have been utilized for myriad metal-free homogeneous catalytic processes. Immobilizing the active Lewis sites to a solid support, especially to porous scaffolds, has shown great potential to ameliorate FLP catalysis by circumventing some of its inherent drawbacks, such as poor product separation and catalyst recyclability. Nevertheless, designing immobilized Lewis pair active sites (LPASs) is challenging due to the requirement of placing the donor and acceptor centers in appropriate geometric arrangements while maintaining the necessary chemical environment to perform catalysis, and clear design rules have not yet been established. In this work, we formulate simple guidelines to build highly active LPASs for direct catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 through a large-scale screening of a diverse library of 25,000 immobilized FLPs. The library is built by introducing boron-containing acidic sites in the vicinity of the existing basic nitrogen sites of the organic linkers of metal&#8211;organic frameworks collected in a "top-down" fashion from the CoRE MOF 2019 database. The chemical and geometrical appropriateness of these LPASs for CO2 hydrogenation is determined by evaluating a series of simple descriptors representing the intrinsic strength (acidity and basicity) of the components and their spatial arrangement in the active sites. Analysis of the leading candidates enables the formulation of pragmatic and experimentally relevant design principles which constitute the starting point for further exploration of FLP-based catalysts for the reduction of CO2.</description>

      <title>Electric Double Layer Effect on the Outer-Sphere Benzyl Halides Electro-Reduction Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c08224</link>
      <description>Aleksandr S. Kramarenko, Ivan Yu. Chernyshov, Evgeny A. Pidko, Journal of physical chemistry. C./Journal of physical chemistry. C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399181814

                Electrocatalytic reduction of organic halides and subsequent carboxylation are promising methods for the valorization of CO2 as a C1 source in synthetic organic chemistry. The reaction mechanism underlying the selectivity and reduction mechanism of benzyl halides is highly dependent on the nature of the electrode material as well as the processes, composition, and structure of the liquid phase at the electrode&#8211;solution interface. Herein, we present a computational study on the influence of the electric double layer (EDL) on the activation of benzyl halides at different applied potentials over the Au (111) cathode. Using a multiscale modeling approach, we demonstrate that, under realistic electrocatalytic conditions, the formation of a dense EDL over the cathode hampers the diffusion of benzyl halides toward the electrode surface. A combination of classical molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations reveals the most favorable benzyl halide electro-carboxylation pathway over the EDL that does not require direct substrate adsorption to the cathode surface. The dense EDL promotes the dissociative reduction of the benzyl halides via the outer-sphere electron transfer from the cathode surface to the electrolyte. Such a reduction mechanism results in a benzyl radical intermediate, which is then converted to benzyl anions in the EDL via an additional electron transfer step.</description>

                This research aims to analyze the efficiency of triangular and trapezoidal membership functions in forecasting CO2, N2O, and CH4 emissions in Indian smart cities. Over 10-years, emissions data for these gases were collected and used to determine membership values for both functions. The study evaluated the performance of the membership functions using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values and percentage error analysis. The results indicated that the trapezoidal membership function provided more accurate results for CO2 and CH4 emissions, while the triangular membership function was more accurate for N2O emissions. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate membership functions tailored to specific gases to enhance emission forecast accuracy. The study emphasizes the significance of such insights for decision-makers, urban planners, and environmental agencies involved in emissions reduction measures and smart city development. However, further research is recommended to validate these findings and explore additional factors that may influence the performance of membership functions in emission prediction in smart cities. In conclusion, this project offers a comprehensive analysis of triangular and trapezoidal membership functions&#8217; accuracy in predicting emissions in Indian smart cities, emphasizing the crucial factors.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Carbon Storage Subsurface Characterization with an Unbiased Seismic Interpretation Technique</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3997/2214-4609.202410209</link>
      <description>Amberyn Thomas, L. Lhommet, N. Tnacheri, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399186166

                Summary ChatGPT This paper focuses on the vital task of quickly identifying potential subsurface locations for carbon storage, a key aspect in combating climate change. It highlights the increasing significance of geoscience in the energy transition, especially in the context of carbon capture and storage (CCS). The major challenges in CCS involve the detailed screening and characterization of geological formations suitable for CO2 storage, a process essential for environmental and practical reasons. The main aim of the paper is to introduce a new method that utilizes advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and seismic interpretation to transform the process of subsurface characterization. Traditional seismic interpretation methods are reliable but slow and prone to human bias, leading to delays in meeting CO2 reduction goals. The proposed AI-driven technique offers unbiased, accurate, and faster seismic interpretation, enhancing site selection efficiency. The paper is structured to initially explain the technical details of the AI-driven seismic interpretation method. It then examines the Smeaheia case study in the North Sea, focusing on aspects such as horizon extraction, cap rock characterization, and fault analysis. Lastly, it explores the wider implications of this AI-based method for future carbon storage selection efforts.</description>

                The physicochemical properties of any material undergo drastic change during reduction of size of particles, particularly at the nanometer region. A large number of possibilities open up in several fields of research and technology. The special properties of nanomaterials made it suitable for different applications. One of the significant challenges faced by the world is the environmental pollution due to released gases from industries, household, and other sources in the form of gas, liquid, and the dispersed materials. Nanomaterials, having high surface area, adjustable properties, particularly those having porosity, are known to adsorb a variety of gaseous substances. Discovery of single-layer graphene at the University of Manchester in 2004 has triggered intense interests in 2D materials in broad fields of science such as chemistry, physics, and material science. Unique properties of 2D materials such as infinitesimal thickness, molecular sieving ability along with good thermal and chemical stability make them ideal building blocks for developing the new generation of high-performance gas and liquid separation membranes. Beyond graphene and its derivatives, abundant 2D nanomaterials such as metal-organic frameworks, transitional metal dichalcogenides, covalent organic frameworks, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and MXenes have been discovered during recent past. The chapter will discuss various aspects of the removal of gas including the underlying mechanisms. As an example, h-BN adsorbs CO2 very loosely. Interestingly, DFT calculation results indicate that the injection of extra electron into the h-BN nanoadsorbent dramatically increases the adsorption of CO2 via a charge-induced chemisorption interaction. When the extra charge is released, there is a spontaneous release of CO2.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Production by Steam Reforming of Ethanol and Dry Reforming of Methane with CO2 on Ni/Vermiculite: Stability Improvement via Acid or Base Treatment of the Support</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29112575</link>
      <description>Hanane Mahir, Abdellah Benzaouak, Farah Mesrar, Adnane El Hamidi, M. El Kacimi, Luca Consentino, Leonarda Francesca Liotta, Molecules/Molecules online/Molecules annual. 29(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399155977

                In this study, vermiculite was explored as a support material for nickel catalysts in two key processes in syngas production: dry reforming of methane with CO2 and steam reforming of ethanol. The vermiculite underwent acid or base treatment, followed by the preparation of Ni catalysts through incipient wetness impregnation. Characterization was conducted using various techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM&#8211;EDS, FTIR, and temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR). TG-TD analyses were performed to assess the formation of carbon deposits on spent catalysts. The Ni-based catalysts were used in reaction tests without a reduction pre-treatment. Initially, raw vermiculite-supported nickel showed limited catalytic activity in the dry reforming of methane. After acid (Ni/VTA) or base (Ni/VTB) treatment, vermiculite proved to be an effective support for nickel catalysts that displayed outstanding performance, achieving high methane conversion and hydrogen yield. The acidic treatment improved the reduction of nickel species and reduced carbon deposition, outperforming the Ni over alkali treated support. The prepared catalysts were also evaluated in ethanol steam reforming under various conditions including temperature, water/ethanol ratio, and space velocity, with acid-treated catalysts confirming the best performance.</description>

      <title>Dynamic performance and control analysis of supercritical CO2 brayton cycle for solid oxide fuel cell waste heat recovery</title>

                Due to the high-temperature operation of solid oxide fuel cell, recovering its exhaust waste heat is worthwhile. The supercritical CO2 cycle features low compression power consumption and high thermal efficiency, making it a promising power cycle. Therefore, this paper adopts the supercritical CO2 recompression cycle as the bottom cycle, combined with solid oxide fuel cell to form a joint system, further improving energy utilization. Given the long temperature response time of the solid oxide fuel cell and the variability of its exhaust waste heat with load changes, this paper innovatively proposes establishing an integrated dynamic model of the joint system, instead of directly providing heat source flow and temperature changes as in traditional research, to more accurately study the dynamic response of the cycle during solid oxide fuel cell startup and load variations. Based on this, a control strategy utilizing inventory control is proposed, and the feasibility of the control effect is verified. The research results indicate that the uncontrolled cycle may lead to safety issues with a significant increase in turbine inlet temperature when solid oxide fuel cell load increases. Under the control strategy, the turbine inlet temperature and main compressor inlet temperature are rapidly stabilized at the target values. The controlled cycle achieves higher efficiency compared to the uncontrolled cycle, particularly prominent during solid oxide fuel cell load reduction, with an efficiency increase of approximately 5.23%.</description>

                This study proposes a straightforward strategy utilizing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to obtain efficient electrocatalysts for synthesizing C2 products (C2H4 and C2H5OH) via a CO2 reduction reaction. Cu-MOF-74 was chosen as the precursor, while copper oxide nanoparticles were obtained through a calcination method. During the calcination process, by controlling the calcination conditions, the porous structure of the MOF framework was successfully retained, leading to CuO-400 with a high catalytic activity and C2 production efficiency. Compared to CuO-n formed by the calcination of Cu(NO3)2, CuO-400 derived from MOFs exhibits a 1.6 times higher C2 activity as an electrocatalytic material at &#8722;1.15 V vs. RHE.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic and Environmental Analyses of an Integrated Liquefied Natural Gas/Allam&#8211;Fetvedt Cycle/Air Separation Unit Complex</title>

                The natural gas (NG)-powered compressors/engines used in liquified natural gas (LNG) plants are a major source of methane emission. The Allam&#8211;Fetvedt cycle (AFC), an oxyfuel, carbon-neutral, high-efficiency power plant, generates pipeline-grade CO2. This work performed novel process modeling, economic analysis, and greenhouse gas emissions analysis for a heat-integrated, electrified LNG/AFC/air separation unit (ASU) complex (LAA), then compared it to standalone LNG and AFC/ASU plants (baseline) as well as an LNG plant electrified with AFC/ASU without heat integration. The low-grade heat generated from compressors of the LNG plant can enhance the AFC net power output by 7.1%. Utilizing the nitrogens cold energy reduces the compressor power requirement by 1.6%. In the integrated LAA complex, not only are GHG emissions avoided, but the energy efficiencies are also improved for both the LNG plant and the AFC power plant. A cash flow analysis of LAA was performed over a 20-year period with 5%, 7%, and 10% discount rates and three levels of LNG prices. The 45Q CO2 credit of USD 85/T as stipulated by the recent Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 has been incorporated. The results clearly indicate the economic and environmental benefits of the proposed electrification and heat/power integration.</description>

      <title>Polymer-Assisted WAG Injection Improves CO2 Flow Properties in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/0624-0083-jpt</link>
      <description>Chris Carpenter, Journal of petroleum technology. 76(06)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399269512

                _ This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper SPE 215024, &#8220;Polymer-Assisted Water-Alternating-Gas for Improving CO2 Flow Properties in Porous Media,&#8221; by Mohsen M. Yegane, SPE, Delft University of Technology and the Dutch Polymer Institute; Thijs van Wieren, SPE, Delft University of Technology; and Ali Fadili, Shell, et al. The paper has not been peer reviewed. _ CO2 flow in porous media is vital for both enhanced oil recovery and underground carbon storage. For improving CO2 mobility control and improved reservoir sweep efficiency, water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection often has been applied. The effectiveness of WAG diminishes, however, because of the presence of microscale reservoir heterogeneity that results in an early breakthrough of gas. In the complete paper, the authors propose polymer-assisted WAG (PA-WAG) as an alternative method to reduce gas mobility and the mobility of the aqueous phase, consequently improving the performance of WAG. In this method, high-molecular-weight water-soluble polymers are added to the water slug. Introduction Recently, PA-WAG has received attention as a method to mitigate early gas breakthrough and gravity segregation during WAG injection. However, the flow mechanisms in PA-WAG injection in porous media remain poorly understood. In particular, no experimental study exists to the authors&#8217; knowledge that demonstrates in-situ visualization and discusses how PA-WAG can improve the gravity override and early gas breakthrough of WAG. The objective of this study is to demonstrate experimentally the feasibility of PA-WAG by conducting a series of X-ray computed tomography (CT) -aided coreflood experiments. To this end, coreflood experiments in Bentheimer cores using different injection schemes (CO2 and polymer injection, WAG injection, and PA-WAG injection) were conducted. The aim of CT scanning during the coreflood experiments was to map the phase saturations at different times of injection. Using dual-energy CT scanning, a reduction in gravity override could be visualized, and the CO2 breakthrough was delayed when PA-WAG was used. Experiments Table 1 of the complete paper presents the various chemical components that were used in this study. The coreflood experiments were performed using Bentheimer sandstone cores. Bentheimer cores have high permeabilities and a homogeneous mineralogy. The porosity of the core samples was measured using CT scanning. To introduce the aqueous phases into the core, a dual-cylinder pump was used. The core, core holder, and heating sleeve were placed in a fixed horizontal position on the CT bench because vertical scanning led to undesirable artifacts and yielded no meaningful insights. Fraction-collector sampling was used to collect effluents at the outlet at various time intervals. CO2 was injected into the system by a mass-flow controller sourced from a dedicated CO2 supply. The pump indirectly introduced both the oleic phase during primary drainage stages and the polymer solution used for secondary or tertiary recovery by means of a transfer vessel. The pressure drop across various sections of the core was measured using four pressure transducers. Pressure and temperature measurements were recorded at 10-second intervals. Four coreflood experiments were conducted in this study. As mentioned, all experiments were performed at pressures and temperatures of 20&#177;1 bar and 40&#177;1&#176;C.</description>

                In recent years, the construction industry has been increasingly focused on finding solutions to improve infrastructure and building performance while fulfilling environmental requirements. One area of focus is the production of cementitious composites, which currently produce high CO2 emissions. However, there are adaptable strategies for decarbonising the cement sector, including nanomaterials like graphene and graphene-related materials (GRM). GRM enhances the lifespan and adds innovative properties to cementitious composites. This study pioneers the application of few-layer graphene (FLG) in cementitious composites, resulting in a notable 94% reduction in electrical resistance and a 55% increase in thermal conductivity. This novel approach can significantly elevate the multifunctionality and performance attributes of cementitious materials, furthering sustainable construction practices.</description>

                Slag is a significant by-product generated in large quantities during metallurgical processes involved in the production of ferrous and nonferrous metals. Due to the chemical compositions and processing feature, various slags can be recycled into cement clinker in large quantities. This chapter reviews several types of slag and their contribution to the sustainable development of cement industry. The processing of cement clinker made with various slag is discussed, and the factors influencing clinker feature are presented. The effect of slag on the clinker mineralogical compositions, hydration feature, and mechanical properties is thereafter assessed. Since there are various elements presented in the slag, which could exert a detrimental effect on the cement properties, the stabilization mechanism and efficiency is discussed. With the industrialization and increased requirement for CO2 reduction, recycling various slags into cement clinker would be the route one must take for both metallurgical and cement field.</description>

      <title>Generic Buffers: A Flexibility Modeling Approach for Predictive Control of an Industrial Steam Network</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4852110</link>

                Steam networks offer a practical solution to increase flexibility in energy-intensive industries, thanks to their potential for electrification and integration of various energy sources. However, effectively using this flexibility requires models that accurately represent system constraints and dynamics for control. While first-principle models provide accuracy, their complexity can hinder practical control applications. This paper proposes a data-driven model using generic buffers to model the intrinsic flexibility and dynamics of a steam network in order to efficiently leverage the available flexibility through model predictive control. Our simulations show significant weekly reductions in CO2 emissions (between 3120 and 7990 tCO2) with an emissions-oriented controller, and in costs (between 0.448 and 1.419 million EUR) with a cost-oriented controller, compared to a pressure-regulating PI controller.</description>

                Light olefins, crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry, are projected to reach a market size of USD 475.8 million by 2027. Traditional methods for producing light olefins, such as cracking and the Fischer&#8211;Tropsch process, are energy-intensive and heavily reliant on fossil fuels. These production methods contribute significantly to environmental issues, emitting approximately 400 million tons of CO2 annually. Integrating solar energy into the olefin synthesis process presents a promising avenue for enhancing sustainability and efficiency. Recent research reveals the potential of utilizing solar energy to activate light-alkanes and COx, enabling solar olefin production via dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and reduction reactions. This review overviews recent advancements and evaluates the prospects of solar energy utilization in olefin synthesis, emphasizing innovative approaches and their potential implications.</description>

      <title>The Green Transition and the Italian Labour Market</title>

      <description>Gaetano Basso, Fabrizio Colonna, Domenico Depalo, Graziella Mendicino, Social Science Research Network. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399310513

                The paper discusses the role of labour in the transition to a net zero economy and provides an analysis for Italy over the period 2011-2021. First, we observe that the emissions generated from production activities declined over this period. We estimate that the contribution of employment reallocation across sectors was modest, while that of sectoral efficiency &#8211; particularly the shift in the energy mix towards cleaner sources &#8211; was decisive. Second, we show that the share of employment in the environmental goods and services sector was small in 2020 and has remained broadly stable since 2014. Our results suggest that, so far, labour has not played a prominent role in the green transition. However, this trend could change in the near future, as CO2 emission reduction targets take on an increasingly key role in production activities.</description>

      <title>Influence of quality and quantity of crop residues on organic carbon dynamics and microbial activity in soil</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.25252/se/2024/243394</link>
      <description>Tahseen Afzal, Abdul Wakeel, Sardar Alam Cheema, Javed Iqbal, Muhammad Sanaullah, Soil &amp; environment. 43(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399264841

                An incubation study investigated the decomposition patterns, microbial activities, soil aggregates distribution, and soil organic carbon (SOC) contents, using four crop residues; wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), and maize (Zea mays L.), at low and high rates (10 and 20 g kg&#8211;1). An average increase of about 35% in cumulative C-CO2 emissions and 26% in soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) was observed at high residue rates as compared to low rates. A positive and strong correlation (0.96) was found between C-CO2 emissions and MBC, and the effect of residue quality on decomposition was found to be less at high rates. The relative reduction in C-CO2 emissions by adding rice residues may be due to their high silica content. Differences in extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) with different residues indicated the effect of residue quality on microbial activities. Cotton residues increased &#946;-glucosidase and chitinase activities by 41 and 38%, respectively, at high rates than at low rates. High maize residues also markedly increased chitinase activity by 41%, implying higher N cycling and fungal prevalence. Acid phosphatase activity was found to increase by about 25 to 32% with high rice and wheat residues, respectively. Higher EEA at high residues input likely reflected the microbial nutritional limitations. Crop residues raised SOC content from 0.7 under control to 1.0% at low residues input but not at high input. Increased macro-aggregates fraction at high residues input may be attributed to higher microbial activities. In summary, high residues input can minimize residue biochemical quality&#8217;s effect on decomposition, with no further increase in SOC content. While a positive effect on the soil MBC, but not on the SOC content, was observed at high residue input, suggesting moderation in the additions of organic amendments is key for SOC buildup. Crop residues, added at 10 g kg&#8211;1, may help maintain a positive SOC balance in the arid agroecosystems by moderating higher microbial activities and soil respiration.</description>

      <title>Observed decade-long improvement of combustion efficiency in the Yangtze River Delta region in China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ad521e</link>

                Abstract The &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratio is a good indicator of the combustion efficiency of carbon-containing fuels, and can be useful to assess the combustion efficiency on a regional scale. In this study, we analyzed in-situ observations of CO2 and CO concentrations from 2011 to 2021 at the Station for Observing Regional Processes of the Earth System (SORPES), in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of eastern China, and calculated the &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratio to investigate the combustion efficiency in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. Furthermore, we used a Lagrangian particle dispersion model WRF-FLEXPART to evaluate the contribution of each emission sources to the observed &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratio. We found that the observed &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratio showed a persistent decreasing trend of 1.0 ppb/ppm per year and decreased ~47.9% during this period, illustrating an evident improvement in the combustion efficiency in the YRD region. The improvement of the combustion efficiency is a result of China&#8217;s Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan announced in 2013. However, the decrease of &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratio slowed down from 1.3 ppb/ppm per year during 2011-2016 to 0.6 ppb/ppm per year during 2017-2021. The simulation results reveal that the slowdown of the decrease in the &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratios can be explained by the slowing improvement of combustion efficiency in steel source in the industry sector. Our results verify the effectiveness of emission reduction efforts in YRD region and highlight the necessity of long-term observations of CO2 and CO.&amp;#xD;</description>

                Lithium significantly reduces the temperature of clinker melt formation and its viscosity, and sulfur promotes the formation of monoclinic alite modification M1, which guarantees higher mechanical strength of cement compared to cement with M3 modification. By a suitable combination of both dopants, it is possible to reduce the burning temperature of clinker by 100 &#8211; 150 &#8451; and, as it was found, to increase the mechanical strength of the cement prepared from this clinker. The initial strengths of this cement show an increase of up to 100% compared to the conventional cement CEM I. Lowering the burning temperature of the clinker would lead to a reduction in the energy demand of the production of the main intermediate product for cement production. At the same time, it is also one of the possibilities to reduce CO2 emissions in cement production, which is one of the current priority goals. X-ray diffraction analysis, optical microscopy, electron microscopy and microanalysis were used for the research.</description>

                Abstract: This review article describes the development of the use of aluminum compounds in the chemistry of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) over the last 14 years. It also discusses the synthesis, reactivity and catalytic applications of intermolecular, intramolecular and so&#8208;called hidden FLPs with phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon Lewis bases. The intrinsically higher acidity of aluminum compounds compared to their boron analogs opens up different reaction pathways. The results are presented in a more or less chronological order. It is shown that Al FLPs react with a variety of polar and non&#8208;polar substrates and form both stable adducts and reversibly activate bonds. Consequently, some catalytic applications of the title compounds were presented such as dimerization of alkynes, hydrogenation of tert&#8209;butyl ethylene and imines, C&#8211;F bond activation, reduction of CO2, dehydrogenation of amine borane and transfer of ammonia. In addition, various Al FLPs were used as initiators in polymerization reactions.</description>

                Abstract Managing waste materials from mining is of universal interest owing to its massive volume, ecological impacts, health hazards, and disposal challenges despite high operational costs. Advancements advocate for recycling mine waste to sustainably support construction. As the construction sector heavily consumes resources, utilizing mine waste from magnesite mines (MMW) in concrete has gained attention. This experimental study assesses the viability of substituting MMW for natural fine and coarse aggregates in self-compacting concrete (SCC) at intervals of 10% up to 50% by weight. Evaluations were done on fresh (slump flow, T50 slump, V-funnel, J-ring, L-box) and hardened (compressive, splitting tensile, and flexural strength) properties, along with microstructural features, cost, and CO2 emissions. The findings unveil that nearly all mixtures exhibit commendable performance, where mine waste is replaced for fine and coarse aggregates showcasing superior fresh and hardened properties, respectively. Fresh property results reveal the SF1 flow category with VF1 and VF2 viscosity types for the SCC mixtures. Moreover, these SCC mixtures observed substantial strength enhancements of approximately 10% to 15% in compressive, splitting tensile and flexural test results at 28 and 90 days. Microstructural analysis corroborates the observed strength outcomes, indicating a denser concrete matrix. Significant environmental and economic benefits were observed, including a notable 20% reduction in CO2 emissions and 17% cost savings. These findings underscore the potential of integrating MMW into SCC mixtures as a sustainable approach towards construction materials, offering both performance and environmental advantages.</description>

      <title>Antimicrobial Assay of Metal Ions Using Yeast and Its Relevance to Food Preservation</title>

                The increasing occurrence of antimicrobial resistance in recent years has spurred research to produce new antimicrobial compounds. However, there is currently a lack of a rapid, simple, and quantitative assay to determine the antimicrobial characteristics of new antimicrobial compounds. In this study, we demonstrated that a simple water displacement apparatus can be used to determine the effects of various metal ions on the cell viability of a model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) by monitoring the volume of CO2 (VCO2) released. Analysis on the effect of different metal ions on S. cerevisiae demonstrated a linear relationship between VCO2 and the reduction potentials and a linear&#8211;logarithmic relationship between VCO2 and the metal/ligand binding constant indicating this measurement's accuracy and quantitative nature. Due to its speed, simplicity, and accuracy, this water displacement method has the potential to be used as a pre-screening method to facilitate the rapid quantification and development of more effective antimicrobial agents for various applications including antimicrobial food preservation and packaging.</description>

      <title>High night temperature stress on rice (Oryza sativa) &#8211; insights from phenomics to physiology. A review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/fp24057</link>
      <description>Awais Riaz, Julie Thomas, Hafiz Haider Ali, Muhammad Saqlain Zaheer, N. Ahmad, Andy Pereira, Functional plant biology. 51(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399194804

                Rice (Oryza sativa) faces challenges to yield and quality due to urbanisation, deforestation and climate change, which has exacerbated high night temperature (HNT). This review explores the impacts of HNT on the physiological, molecular and agronomic aspects of rice growth. Rise in minimum temperature threatens a potential 41% reduction in rice yield by 2100. HNT disrupts rice growth stages, causing reduced seed germination, biomass, spikelet sterility and poor grain development. Recent findings indicate a 4.4% yield decline for every 1&#176;C increase beyond 27&#176;C, with japonica ecotypes exhibiting higher sensitivity than indica. We examine the relationships between elevated CO2, nitrogen regimes and HNT, showing that the complexity of balancing positive CO2 effects on biomass with HNT challenges. Nitrogen enrichment proves crucial during the vegetative stage but causes disruption to reproductive stages, affecting grain yield and starch synthesis. Additionally, we elucidate the impact of HNT on plant respiration, emphasising mitochondrial respiration, photorespiration and antioxidant responses. Genomic techniques, including CRISPR-Cas9, offer potential for manipulating genes for HNT tolerance. Plant hormones and carbohydrate enzymatic activities are explored, revealing their intricate roles in spikelet fertility, grain size and starch metabolism under HNT. Gaps in understanding genetic factors influencing heat tolerance and potential trade-offs associated with hormone applications remain. The importance of interdisciplinary collaboration is needed to provide a holistic approach. Research priorities include the study of regulatory mechanisms, post-anthesis effects, cumulative HNT exposure and the interaction between climate variability and HNT impact to provide a research direction to enhance rice resilience in a changing climate.</description>

      <title>Physiological and growth responses of lettuce plants submitted of 2,4-D simulated drift</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.14295/cs.v15.4083</link>
      <description>Roberta Bianchin Rebesquini, Nat&#225;lia Teixeira Schwab, Camila Peligrinotti Tarouco, Ja&#237;ne Rubert, Paola Ana Buffon, Aline Sielo Holkem, Andr&#233; da Rosa Ulguim, Comunicata Scientiae. 15(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399297521

                Pesticide drift is due to the transport of the active ingredient to areas not targeted by spraying, causing negative effects on the sensitive crops&#8217; development. The aim of this study was to evaluate lettuce response to simulated 2,4-D drift. Experiments were conducted in the greenhouse, in a randomized complete block design with four replications. The treatments consisted of nine different doses of the 2,4-D herbicide, which are: 0; 1.56; 3.125; 6.20; 12.5; 25; 50; 75; and 100% from the recommended dose (670 g a.a. ha-1). The application occurred when the lettuce plants had four to six true leaves. The analyzed variables were visual injury (phytotoxicity), development parameter (phyllochron), growth (rosette diameter and dry mass of the aerial part), and photosynthetic parameters (gas exchange). The lettuce crop showed high sensitivity to the 2,4-D herbicide, with the lowest dose resulting in significant phytotoxic damage to plants, and from 12.5% of the recommended 2,4-D dose, visual injuries were greater than 90%. The plants&#180; development and growth were negatively affected by the increased drift doses, culminating in enhanced phyllochron and reduction in rosette diameter and dry mass of the aerial part. The gas exchange of the crop was affected from 6.20% of the recommended dose, causing a reduction in the CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate and rubisco carboxylation efficiency.</description>

                This chapter examines the dynamics of energy poverty and efficiency in low-income households, particularly in the contexts of Germany and Sweden. It explores the intricacies of the landlord-tenant dilemma and the impact of energy efficiency modernisation on vulnerable social groups. The research addresses the absence of a uniform legal definition of low-income households in Germany, emphasizing the socio-cultural subsistence level and the relativity of poverty. The study highlights the critical role of energy efficiency in reducing energy poverty and contributing to CO2 reduction and climate change policies. The complex phenomenon of energy poverty is examined through various lenses, including the socio-economic, legal, and housing market perspectives. Significantly, the study provides insights into the energy poverty situation in Germany and Sweden. It reviews the performance of these countries in population-based and expenditure-based indicators of energy poverty, comparing them with the EU average. The research underscores the need for effective policies to address the challenges of energy poverty, particularly in rented housing, to achieve climate goals and EU obligations.</description>

                Using local materials is important for reduction of cost and CO2 emission. Dune sand is prevalent in Middle East but has not been widely used in concrete products. In UAE, for construction purposes, quartz sand, which was not available locally, was imported from the neighbour and European countries at relatively high cost. In this paper, we present our early results of our trials using UAE local dune sand to replace quartz sand for UHPC reinforced fibre. Natural dune sand was used directly without any pre-treatment. The dune sand is charaterised as reddish round to subrounded fine sand with 99% particles passing sieve 0.5mm. The chemical analysis results show that the silica content of the dune sand is 67%. Our initial compressive and flexural test results have shown that dune sand is highly suitable for UHPC hence normal concrete. The compressive strength and flexural strength are sufficient, suitable more many applications, suggesting that it can replace quart sand in concrete.</description>

      <title>Carbon performance analysis of upgraded wastewater treatment plants in key control areas of the Ziya River Basin in China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121304</link>

                Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and they are also one of the largest energy consumption industries in urban systems. With the progression of upgrading and standard-rising, WWTPs both directly and indirectly increase carbon emissions from the increased investments in facilities and usages in electricity as well as chemical agents. Here, we collected operational data from 15 WWTPs in the key control areas of the Ziya River Basin in North China and accounted for the changes in carbon performance at different technical upgrade methods. Results showed that the average carbon emission performance increased by 0.487 kg CO2/m3 after the upgrade. Carbon emissions from electricity consumption, chemical usage, biochemical process and sludge treatment accounted for 42%, 17%, 24%, and 17% of the total improvement in carbon emission performance, respectively. Reducing energy consumption, regulating chemical use and sludge comprehensive utilization are the key to carbon emission reduction. It further proposes that the development of wastewater treatment discharge standards should fully consider the comprehensive utilization of water quality classification. Regions with favorable natural conditions should make full use of their advantages by adopting economically feasible, low-energy-consuming technologies such as constructed wetlands, which offer carbon sequestration and landscaping benefits. This study provides guidance on the selection of technological pathways for pollution reduction and carbon mitigation in the wastewater treatment industry and on achieving sustainable water resource utilization.</description>

      <title>Towards Comprehensive Uncertainty Quantification in Direct-Use Geothermal Systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3997/2214-4609.2024101678</link>

                Summary The energy transition requires a reduction of CO2 emissions from anthropogenic activity. In Europe, heat amounts to 50% of the total gross energy consumption. In conduction-dominated geological settings, geothermal resources can supply renewable, baseload heat for direct uses, in almost all parts of Europe. In these settings, economic viability can be challenging and should be considered as coupled to the development of geothermal fields. The aim of this paper is to outline the way towards comprehensive uncertainty quantification. A methodology is proposed identifying three main categories of uncertainty sources to be evaluated based on three key performance indicators in a systematic approach. The sources of uncertainty include: a) subsurface characterization, b) development options and c) economics. The performance indicators are : i) cumulative energy generated, ii) system lifetime and iii) economic output. Each of the uncertainty sources and performance indicators are used to demonstrate the importance of a comprehensive approach to uncertainty quantification. Standardization and comprehensive analysis considering the combined uncertainty across the different uncertainty levels and over the key performance indicators is needed to enable more reliable and robust predictions of geothermal developments.</description>

                Copper and palladium exhibit excellent catalytic performance for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR). Here, a PdxCu4&#8211;x (x = 2, 3) cluster was supported on CeO2 with different sites to form three kinds of novel nanocatalysts, namely, Pd2Cu2/CeO2, Pd3Cu/CeO2 (Pd&#8211;Pd), and Pd3Cu/CeO2 (Pd&#8211;Cu). Based on density functional theory, the catalytic performance and selective mechanisms were studied systematically. During the process of CO2RR, *CO was hydrogenated to produce deeply reduced products such as CH4 or CH3OH due to its strong adsorption energies on all three catalysts (Pd3Cu/CeO2(Pd&#8211;Pd) for 0.95 eV, Pd3Cu/CeO2(Pd&#8211;Cu) for 0.89 eV, and Pd2Cu2/CeO2 for 1.22 eV). The overpotential to form the CH4 or CH3OH product can be changed by varying the atomic ratio or anchoring sites of PdxCu4&#8211;x clusters on CeO2. In particular, the CO2RR on Pd2Cu2/CeO2 showed the lowest overpotentiontial (&#8722;0.60 eV) compared to the other two Pd3Cu/CeO2 catalysts. This study extends the family of CO2RR catalysts and the application scenarios of bimetallic catalysts, which provides new insights into the design and preparation of composite nanocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Energetic, Exergetic, and Techno-Economic Analysis of A Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Utilization Process via Integrated Torrefaction&#8211;CLC&#8211;Methanation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17112690</link>
      <description>Enrico Alberto Cutillo, Claudio Tregambi, Piero Bareschino, Erasmo Mancusi, Gaetano Continillo, Francesco Pepe, Energies. 17(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399300368

                Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or utilization (BECCU) allows net zero or negative carbon emissions and can be a breakthrough technology for climate change mitigation. This work consists of an energetic, exergetic, and economic analysis of an integrated process based on chemical looping combustion of solar-torrefied agro-industrial residues, followed by methanation of the concentrated CO2 stream with green H2. Four agro-industrial residues and four Italian site locations are considered. Depending on the considered biomass, the integrated plant processes about 18&#8211;93 kg h&#8722;1 of raw biomass and produces 55&#8211;70 t y&#8722;1 of synthetic methane. Global exergetic efficiencies ranged within 45&#8211;60% and 67&#8211;77% when neglecting and considering, respectively, the valorization of torgas. Sugar beet pulp and grape marc required a non-negligible input exergy flow for the torrefaction, due to the high moisture content of the raw biomasses. However, for these biomasses, the water released during drying/torrefaction and CO2 methanation could be recycled to the electrolyzer to eliminate external water consumption, thus allowing for a more sustainable use of water resources. For olive stones and hemp hurd, this water recycling brings, instead, a reduction of approximately 65% in water needs. A round-trip electric efficiency of 28% was estimated assuming an electric conversion efficiency of 40%. According to the economic analysis, the total plant costs ranged within 3&#8211;5 M&#8364; depending on the biomass and site location considered. The levelized cost of methane (LCOM) ranged within 4.3&#8211;8.9 &#8364; kgCH4&#8722;1 but, if implementing strategies to avoid the use of a large temporary H2 storage vessel, can be decreased to 2.6&#8211;5.3 &#8364; kgCH4&#8722;1. Lower values are obtained when considering hemp hurd and grape marc as raw biomasses, and when locating the PV field in the south of Italy. Even in the best scenario, values of LCOM are out of the market if compared to current natural gas prices, but they might become competitive with the introduction of a carbon tax or through government incentives for the purchase of the PV field and/or electrolyzer.</description>

      <title>Techno-Commercial Assessment Framework for Co-Firing Hydrogen in Gas Power Plants to Reduce Carbon Emissions</title>

                Summary This study explores pathways to leverage potential opportunities to deploy hydrogen co-firing and draw a roadmap for the power plant to produce hydrogen while increasing use of renewables and reducing carbon emissions to achieve decarbonization of this sector. For this, a thorough techno-commercial assessment framework for co-firing hydrogen in gas power plants to reduce carbon emission is developed supported by energy transition strategy, process engineering modeling, flow simulation, and economics modeling to connect the different components involved in the studied hydrogen value chain. The conclusions drawn from the study show that: (i) to meet these objectives will require a full integration of multiple technologies packaged into a viable hydrogen value chain to deliver the required hydrogen volume; (ii) the hydrogen co-firing in the studied gas power plants will only contribute to a portion of the CO2 emission targets; (iii) a further reduction to meet the net zero target will be achieved by introducing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies combined with the development of multiple renewable energy projects, such as large-scale solar projects. Finally, this study strongly confirms that technologies developed for oil and gas can easily be adapted to energy transition strategies for hydrogen for power generation.</description>

      <title>Circular Economy Approach: Recycling Toner Waste in Cement-Based Construction Materials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114707</link>
      <description>R.J. Ring, Gisela Cordoba, Natalia Delbianco, Carla Priano, Viviana F&#225;tima Rahhal, Sustainability. 16(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399208932

                Based on a waste generated survey by companies in the area of the city of Bahia Blanca (Argentina), the possibility of incorporating part of them in a Portland cement matrix was examined. Among the waste is toner (TW), which is obtained from cartridges used in photocopiers, laser printers, and faxes. This paper aims to analyze the physical and mechanical properties of cement pastes and mortars using toner as a Portland cement replacement compared to a reference sample without toner. The mixes were made with 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 wt.% replacement of cement by toner, and it was measured the flow, normal consistency, setting time, calorimetry, and Frattini test in pastes and mechanical strengths in mortars employing standardized tests. Also, an analysis of the leachate in the curing water was carried out after 56 days to look for contaminating materials. The replacement of up to 5% cement with toner did not produce substantial alterations in the final setting time or mechanical properties. No heavy metals were found in the leachate, so TW can be immobilized in a cementitious matrix as it does not cause leaching above the established limits. Therefore, TW from a local industry can be used in construction materials and could contribute to a reduction of up to 14% of CO2 emissions with a cement replacement of 15% in cement-based materials.</description>

      <title>Feature based bipolar plate forming</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/1307/1/012032</link>
      <description>D. Meelkop, Hans-Karl Janssen, C. Brecher, IOP conference series. Materials science and engineering. 1307(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399212068

                Abstract By the end of the 1990s, the global peak of energy supply from oil and gas deposits had already been reached. Since then, there has been a clear trend towards the development of new, more sustainable ways of supplying energy. To realize this reduction, a holistic and rapid restructuring of the energy supply towards CO2-free and renewable energy production, storage and processing across all areas of life is necessary. The development and implementation of a functioning hydrogen economy can be crucial with respect to the goal of climate neutrality. The scale-up and commercialization of technologies for the cost-effective production and use of hydrogen carry significant importance. Accordingly, innovative production technologies and process chains must be developed to be able to manufacture fuel cells reliably in high volumes and at optimized costs. In this context, BPPs in the PEM-FC are responsible for about 80 % of the total weight, just over 50 % of the system volume, and up to 40 % of the total cost. Current research approaches in the field of BPP forming focus mainly on the optimization of a pre-selected production technology. Thereby, the possibility of combining different forming technologies to represent a holistic process chain is mostly disregarded. This research gap is to be closed by the developments within the scope of this work. The bipolar plate is not to be regarded as a coherent component, but as a composition of different geometric features.</description>

      <title>The Electric Vehicle Market in Brazil: A Systematic Literature Review of Factors Influencing Purchase Decisions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114594</link>
      <description>Marceli Adriane Schvartz, Amanda Lange Salvia, Luciana Brandli, Walter Leal Filho, Lucas Veiga &#195;&#129;vila, Sustainability. 16(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399176718

                Technological advancement has propelled global economic growth, but it has also led to high rates of pollution emissions, underscoring the urgency of environmental issues. The transportation sector, particularly the rise in individual vehicle ownership, significantly contributes to atmospheric pollution. In this context, Brazil faces growing challenges, largely due to the high number of individual motor vehicles. Transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs) is seen as a sustainable alternative to reduce emissions of polluting gases. However, it is important to consider that EVs may indirectly generate pollution due to energy production in thermal power plants. Nevertheless, EVs are often sought by countries to reduce dependence on imported fuels and to mitigate urban pollution. This study aims to understand the factors influencing the purchase decision of EVs in Brazil through a systematic literature review and validation by specialists using the fuzzy Delphi method. The results indicate 37 variables, grouped into five main blocks: psychological factors, performance factors, environmental factors, barriers, and prospects for the automotive sector. The validation of these variables by specialists provides a solid foundation for the next stage of the research, which involves administering the questionnaire to the general community. Considering these results will lead to strategies aimed at promoting EV adoption, in line with global sustainability challenges and the reduction in CO2 emissions.</description>

      <title>Porphyrin Aggregation under Homogeneous Conditions Inhibits Electrocatalysis: A Case Study on CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction</title>

                Metalloporphyrins are widely used as homogeneous electrocatalysts for transformations relevant to clean energy and sustainable organic synthesis. Metalloporphyrins are well-known to aggregate due to &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, but surprisingly, the influence of aggregation on homogeneous electrocatalytic performance has not been investigated previously. Herein, we present three structurally related iron meso-phenylporphyrins whose aggregation properties are different in commonly used N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) electrolyte. Both spectroscopy and light scattering provide evidence of extensive porphyrin aggregation under conventional electrocatalytic conditions. Using the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO as a test reaction, cyclic voltammetry reveals an inverse dependence of the kinetics on the catalyst concentration. The inhibition extends to bulk performance, where up to 75% of the catalyst at 1 mM is inactive compared to at 0.25 mM. We additionally report how aggregation is perturbed by organic additives, axial ligands, and redox state. Periodic boundary calculations provide additional insights into aggregate stability as a function of metalloporphyrin structure. Finally, we generalize the aggregation phenomenon by surveying metalloporphyrins with different metals and substituents. This study demonstrates that homogeneous metalloporphyrins can aggregate severely in well-solubilizing organic electrolytes, that aggregation can be easily modulated through experimental conditions, and that the extent of aggregation must be considered for accurate catalytic benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the Impact of Driver Behavior on the Carbon Footprint in Morocco's Transportation Sector</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2024.05.060</link>
      <description>Laila Benabbou, Mimoun Benali, Ghada Moufdi, Hicham SADOK, Procedia computer science. 236(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399249653

                With population growth, industrial expansion, and increased energy demand intensifying pollution, Morocco is suffering from a shortage of fossil fuels, urgently calling for climate intervention to stimulate the imperative reduction of its carbon footprint. Indeed, the country has realized that it is time to monitor its environmental indicators such as energy consumption, accounting, and carbon footprint to comply with global efforts to reduce carbon footprint and aim for energy efficiency while preserving and optimizing its energy resources. Much attention has been focused on the transportation sector, the second-largest global polluter, which will be the subject of our analysis. Our case study will focus on the evaluation of three vehicles to examine the influence of driver behavior on energy consumption and carbon footprint. Data collection was carried out using UPLOGISTIX, a solution developed by our hosting entity, which aims to present calculations of environmental measures to display the results and ultimately provide recommendations for reducing its carbon footprint. An approach has been proposed to achieve the set objectives. The results of our analysis highlight the existence of a significant relationship between behavioral barriers and energy consumption. Indeed, the behavior of a reckless driver, characterized by abrupt braking, rapid accelerations, and other factors, leads to an actual energy consumption that exceeds recommended standards. This excessive consumption results in a considerable production of CO2 emissions.</description>

                Attempts to create a novel Mg&#8208;Be bond by reaction of [(DIPePBDI*)MgNa]2 with Be[N(SiMe3)2]2 failed; DIPePBDI* = HC[(tBu)C=N(DIPeP)]2, DIPeP = 2,6&#8208;Et2C&#8208;phenyl. Even at elevated temperatures, no conversion was observed. This is likely caused by strong steric shielding of the Be center. A similar reaction with the more open Cp*BeCl gave in quantitative yield (DIPePBDI)MgBeCp* (1). The crystal structure shows a Mg&#8208;Be bond of 2.469(4) &#197;. Homolytic cleavage of the Mg&#8208;Be bond requires &#916;H = 69.6 kcal mol&#713;1 (cf. CpBe&#8208;BeCp 69.0 kcal mol&#713;1 and (DIPPBDI)Mg&#8208;Mg(DIPPBDI) 55.8 kcal mol&#713;1). Natural&#8208;Population&#8208;Analysis (NPA) shows fragment charges: (DIPePBDI*)Mg +0.27 / BeCp* &#8208;0.27. The very low NPA charge on Be (+0.62) compared to Mg (+1.21) and the strongly upfield 9Be NMR signal at &#8208;23.7 ppm are in line with considerable electron density on Be and the formal oxidation state assignment of MgII&#8208;Be0. Despite this Mg&#948;+&#8208;Be&#948;&#713; polarity, 1 is extremely thermally stable and unreactive towards H2, CO, N2, cyclohexene and carbodiimide. It reacted with benzophenone, azobenzene, phenyl acetylene, CO2 and CS2. Reaction with 1&#8208;adamantyl azide led to reductive coupling and formation of an N6&#8208;chain. The azide reagent also inserted in the Cp*&#8208;Be bond. The inertness of 1 is likely due to bulky ligands protecting the Mg&#8208;Be unit.</description>

                Environmental pollution and the rapid decline in the availability of fossil fuels are the major concerns of the electric power industry in recent years. Effective utilization of electrical energy is the need of the hour in building the nation towards sustainable development. This study presents the energy consumption analysis and management performed in a diary firm located in Tamil Nadu, India. Initially, the energy usage of the firm is estimated based on its electricity bills, meter readings, and survey followed by detailed energy consumption analysis and evaluation. The study employs guidelines provided by the Indian Bureau of Energy Efficiency for energy management. The detailed analysis performed finds scopes for improvement in efficient energy usage. Numerical analysis shows that implementation of proposed action plans that include installation of automatic power factor correction, replacement of overheating equipment, and replacement of lighting systems with energy-efficient lighting would save annual energy of 123.96 kWh which in turn results in the reduction of annual CO2 emission by 117.76 tonnes. Furthermore, this paper also proposes a novel optimal process scheduling which optimally schedules different processes in the firm without affecting productivity. This makes an additional savings of INR 4,23,360 per annum in the energy cost by minimizing the maximum demand of the firm with zero investment. A comparison of the proposed approach with existing methodologies available in the literature shows the effectiveness of the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Modelling of carbon flows in the value chain of packaging plastics in the context of sustainable carbon management</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2024.06.002</link>
      <description>Stijn Van der Perre, Oleksii Mynko, Kevin M. Van Geem, Tomas Wyns, Sustainable production and consumption. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399303979

                The low share of plastic recycling means significant losses for the economy as well as for the environment, especially for plastic packaging materials since they are the largest end-use market for plastics and characterized by a typical short first-use cycle. The main polymers used in packaging applications are basic polymers, such as PE, PP, PS and PET, which consist mainly of fossil carbon locked up in polymer form. This study attempts to map carbon flows across the packaging plastics value chain with the goal to optimize carbon fixation in relevant polymers over multiple life cycles and minimize carbon loss to the atmosphere via CO2 emissions. Evaluating these carbon balances in the production, consumption and end-of-life treatment phase of these polymers provides more insight in the carbon losses during their life cycle. Three case studies were considered; (1) a baseline route (BASE), representing the current linear plastics economy model which is benchmarked with two theoretical sustainable scenarios: (2) an electrified (ELEC) and (3) a biobased (BIO) route. Specific parameters and assumptions in these three cases were adapted, such as feedstock type, recycling rate, type of recycling etc. Improved recycling rates and advanced recycling methods were applied in the sustainable cases and had a positive effect on carbon retention in products. Allowing a numerical comparison, a method was developed to quantify this carbon retention via the half lifetime of carbon in materials over multiple life cycles. The half lifetime evolved from 0.3 year in the BASE route to 2.0 and 2.6 years in the BIO and ELEC route, respectively. However, even these sustainable, optimized routes remained insufficient to embed carbon in plastic products for many years without too much carbon loss. It is inevitable that an enhanced (carbon) circularity in these routes comes by a certain energy cost; about 46 GJ more energy was required per extra recycled ton carbon in the ELEC route (compared to BASE). But at the same time this intensified carbon conservation leads to a CO2 emission reduction potential of 80 %. The present work illustrates the potential of chemical recycling, and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) techniques for end-of-life treatment of plastic packaging products, but additional process development and process intensification in all facets of the value chain are needed to minimize carbon leakage over multiple lifecycles. Hence, waste management policy could be an important instrument to support further enhancement in plastics circularity.</description>

      <title>Single mixed refrigerant biomethane liquefaction plant integrated with solar energy: Dynamic simulation for the decarbonization of the heavy road transport sector</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.121261</link>
      <description>Francesco Calise, Francesco Liberato Cappiello, Luca Cimmino, Massimo Dentice d&#8217;Accadia, Maria Vicidomini, Journal of environmental management. 361(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399153050

                This works proposes a dynamic thermoeconomic analysis of a liquefied biomethane production plant to meet the fuel demand of a fleet of heavy duty trucks in the south of Italy. The biomethane is obtained from the upgrading of the biogas produced by means of anaerobic digestion through a plug flow reactor fed by organic fraction of municipal solid waste. The upgrading of the biogas is realized using a three-stage membrane compression process, producing a 96 % pure biomethane. The biomethane liquefaction is realized using a single-mixed refrigerant process and compared to a Linde cycle process. The whole system is assisted by solar energy to reduce the fossil energy consumption of the process and feed-in tariffs are considered as funding policy. The models for the anaerobic digestion, the biogas upgrading, and the biomethane liquefaction are in detail developed in MatLab. The anaerobic digestion model is based on the ADM1 biological model, integrated with a suitable heat transfer model. The biogas upgrading model is based on a simplified Fick model. The liquefaction model is based on an equivalent two heat-exchangers model, taking into account the transient heat transfer. All the components are then integrated in TRNSYS to perform the dynamic simulation for one operating year of the whole system. Results from the thermoeconomic analysis are outstanding in terms of profitability, showing a payback period of less than 2 years and a Net Present Value of the system of 402 M&#8364;. The great environmental impact is also confirmed by a Primary Energy Saving of 91 % and a dramatic reduction of 86 % of the CO2 equivalent emissions.</description>

      <title>High-volume fly ash self-compacting concrete for coastal constructions: A sustainable development solution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54772/jomc.v14i01.704</link>
      <description>C. Hung, Journal of materials and construction. 14(01)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399294155

                This article presents the research results on the effectiveness of applying high-volume fly ash self-compacting concrete (SCC) in constructing environmentally influenced structures along the coast of Vietnam. SCC is designed with fly ash replacing 70% and 80% of cement. Technical criteria evaluated include workability, compressive strength, chloride ion permeability, water absorption, and dry bulk density of SCC. Additionally, the energy consumption, environmental emissions, and production costs of high-volume fly ash SCC are also assessed. The results show that SCC with 70% and 80% fly ash replacement by weight meets construction requirements, with compressive strengths at 28 days reaching 25.1 MPa and 21.2 MPa, and at 90 days reaching 49.4 MPa and 28.3 MPa respectively; chloride ion permeability is very low, electrical resistivity at 28 days is 690C and 539C; water absorption at 28 days is approximately 2.3% and 2.6%; dry bulk density at 28 days is 2239 kg/m3 and 2225 kg/m3. Compared to conventional concrete with equivalent compressive strengths of 20 MPa and 25 MPa (BT200, BT250), using high-volume fly ash SCC with 70% and 80% fly ash replacement results in energy consumption reduction by 45.28% and 53.45% respectively; CO2, NOx, SOx emissions are reduced by (52.41%, 54.26%, 53.95%) and (62.21%, 64.33%, 64.13%); material production costs decrease by 15.14% and 17.16% respectively. Utilizing high-volume fly ash SCC as a solution for coastal constructions proves to be technically feasible, cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and sustainable.</description>

      <title>Insights into the spatiotemporal heterogeneity, sectoral contributions and drivers of provincial CO2 emissions in China from 2019 to 2022</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2024.05.041</link>
      <description>Hanyu Zhang, Weidong Guo, Siwen Wang, Zhiliang Yao, Ling Lv, Yan Teng, Xin Li, Xianbao Shen, Journal of Environmental Sciences/Journal of environmental sciences. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399208776

                CO2 emissions (CEs) pose a growing threat to environmental changes and global warming, attracting extensive attention. Here, we leveraged near-real-time monitoring data spanning 2019 to 2022 to investigate spatiotemporal heterogeneity, sectoral contributions, provincial spatial correlation, and driving factors influencing CEs at the provincial level in China. Our analysis, integrating Moran's Index analysis, Spearman correlation analysis, and the Geographically Weighted Regression model, unveiled China's consistent world-leading CEs, surpassing 10,000 Mt over the study period. Spatially, CEs exhibited a heterogeneous distribution, with markedly higher emissions in eastern and northern regions compared to western and southern areas. Temporally, CEs displayed significant fluctuations, peaking in the fourth quarter before declining in subsequent quarters. Chinese New Year and COVID-19 had the biggest effects on CEs, with average daily reductions of -20.8 % and -18.9 %, respectively, compared to the four-year average and the same period in 2019. Sectoral analysis highlighted the power and industry sectors as primary contributors to CEs in China, jointly accounting for 37.9 %-40.2 % and 43.5 %-46.4 % of total CEs, respectively. Spatial clustering analysis identified a distinct High-High agglomeration region, predominantly encompassing provinces such as Inner Mongolia, Shandong and Jiangsu. Furthermore, total energy consumption and electricity consumption emerged as significant drivers of CEs, exhibiting correlation coefficients exceeding 0.9, followed by exhaust emissions, population size, and gross domestic product. Moreover, the influence of drivers on provincial CEs exhibited notable spatial heterogeneity, with regression coefficients displaying a decreasing gradient from north to south. These findings provide scientific and technological support to realize the provincial dual-carbon goals in China.</description>

      <title>New Generation Graphenes in Cement-Based Materials: Production, Property Enhancement, and Life Cycle Analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c01924</link>
      <description>Sahil Surehali, Sayee Srikarah Volaity, Aude Simon, Ranjith Divigalpitiya, Aditya Kumar, Narayanan Neithalath, ACS sustainable chemistry &amp; engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399303643

                Several studies have explored the use of graphene to improve the properties of cement-based materials. However, most commercially available graphenes are expensive, not amenable to mass production, and have high embodied energy and emissions, making their use in concrete less attractive, despite the beneficial mechanical property attributes. This paper discusses the use of two novel graphene types, fractal graphene (FG) and reactive graphene (RG), obtained through a cost-effective and scalable detonation synthesis, in cement-based materials. FG and RG are sheets containing 6&#8211;10 layers, with lateral dimensions of 20&#8211;50 nm and a z-axis thickness of &lt;5 nm. RG is functionalized with carboxylic groups. An ultrasonication process is employed to ensure dispersion of graphene particles in aqueous solutions. Both FG and RG, when added at very small dosages (&#8804;0.04% by mass of cement), enhance the compressive strength of cement mortars by &gt;70% at early ages and up to 20% at later ages. The beneficial effect of functionalization results in better performance for RG-modified mixtures, even at dosages as low as 0.02%. Concomitant enhancements in heat of hydration, hydrate formation, and rheological response are observed. A significant reduction in porosity and critical pore size (by 50% or more) promises significantly improved concrete durability, and thus reduced life-cycle costs. A comparative life cycle analysis (LCA) is used to show that FG- and RG-modified mortars have normalized (by the 28 d strength) energy demand and global warming potential (GWP) that is up to 15% lower than those of conventional mortars. Overall, this study shows that FG and RG, manufactured through a scalable, cost-, energy-, and CO2-efficient detonation synthesis, can beneficially impact the engineering and environmental performance of concretes.</description>

                Two thermophilic spore-forming sulfate-reducing strains, 435T and 781, were isolated from oil and gas reservoirs in Western Siberia (Russia) about 50 years ago. Both strains were found to be neutrophilic, chemoorganotrophic, anaerobic bacteria, growing at 45&#8211;70 &#176;C (optimum, 55&#8211;60 &#176;C) and with 0&#8211;4.5% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0.5&#8211;1% NaCl). The major fatty acids were iso-C15:0, iso-C17:0, C16:0, and C18:0. In sulfate-reducing conditions, the strains utilized H2/CO2, formate, lactate, pyruvate, malate, fumarate, succinate, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, butyrate, valerate, and palmitate. In 2005, based on phenotypic characteristics and a 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the strains were described as &#8216;Desulfotomaculum salinum&#8217; sp. nov. However, this species was not validly published because the type strain was not deposited in two culture collections. In this study, a genomic analysis of strain 435T was carried out to determine its taxonomic affiliation. The genome size of strain 435T was 2.886 Mb with a 55.1% genomic G + C content. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA&#8211;DNA hybridization values were highest between strain 435T and members of the genus Desulfofundulus, 78.7&#8211;93.3% and 25.0&#8211;52.2%, respectively; these values were below the species delineation cut-offs (&lt;95&#8211;96% and &lt;70%). The cumulative phenotypic and phylogenetic data indicate that two strains represent a novel species within the genus Desulfofundulus, for which the name Desulfofundulus salinus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 435T (=VKM B-1492T = DSM 23196T). A genome analysis of strain 435T revealed the genes for dissimilatory sulfate reduction, autotrophic carbon fixation via the Wood&#8211;Ljungdahl pathway, hydrogen utilization, methanol and organic acids metabolism, and sporulation, which were confirmed by cultivation studies.</description>

                Abstract. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessments are the trusted source of scientific evidence for climate negotiations taking place under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Evidence-based decision-making needs to be informed by up-to-date and timely information on key indicators of the state of the climate system and of the human influence on the global climate system. However, successive IPCC reports are published at intervals of 5&#8211;10 years, creating potential for an information gap between report cycles. We follow methods as close as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One (WGI) report. We compile monitoring datasets to produce estimates for key climate indicators related to forcing of the climate system: emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, the Earth's energy imbalance, surface temperature changes, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. The purpose of this effort, grounded in an open-data, open-science approach, is to make annually updated reliable global climate indicators available in the public domain (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11388387, Smith et al., 2024a). As they are traceable to IPCC report methods, they can be trusted by all parties involved in UNFCCC negotiations and help convey wider understanding of the latest knowledge of the climate system and its direction of travel. The indicators show that, for the 2014&#8211;2023 decade average, observed warming was 1.19 [1.06 to 1.30] &#176;C, of which 1.19 [1.0 to 1.4] &#176;C was human-induced. For the single-year average, human-induced warming reached 1.31 [1.1 to 1.7] &#176;C in 2023 relative to 1850&#8211;1900. The best estimate is below the 2023-observed warming record of 1.43 [1.32 to 1.53] &#176;C, indicating a substantial contribution of internal variability in the 2023 record. Human-induced warming has been increasing at a rate that is unprecedented in the instrumental record, reaching 0.26 [0.2&#8211;0.4] &#176;C per decade over 2014&#8211;2023. This high rate of warming is caused by a combination of net greenhouse gas emissions being at a persistent high of 53&#177;5.4 Gt CO2e yr&#8722;1 over the last decade, as well as reductions in the strength of aerosol cooling. Despite this, there is evidence that the rate of increase in CO2 emissions over the last decade has slowed compared to the 2000s, and depending on societal choices, a continued series of these annual updates over the critical 2020s decade could track a change of direction for some of the indicators presented here.</description>
