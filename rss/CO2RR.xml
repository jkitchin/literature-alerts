                Carbon dioxide is a significant byproduct from the usage of fossil fuels. Due to the rapid development of industry and the swift growth of urban populations, carbon dioxide has been accumulating in large quantities over the past decades. In terms of new energy research, carbon dioxide reduction has been given significant attention due to its non-toxic nature and the high utility of the products from its reduction. Electrochemical reduction, in particularly, has been highlighted for its notable benefits. This paper introduces the mechanism of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction, its current shortcomings, and methods of improvement, summarizing the recent deficiencies and advancements in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction. The current belief is that refining the electrolytes like ionic liquids and using catalysts such as graphene and its derivatives can enhance the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. This paper looks forward to research findings that will discover better electrolytes and catalysts to address the current deficiencies in carbon dioxide reduction and hopes to promote the full potential of electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction in future new energy applications.</description>

                Since the turn of the twenty-first century, the need to find new energy sources to create a low-carbon society has grown urgently due to the ongoing rise in greenhouse gas emissions, which are mostly caused by CO2. The technique that uses solar energy to convert CO2 into hydrocarbon fuels can produce high-value hydrocarbon fuels like methane, methanol, formic acid, or C2+. This is a promising method of achieving global carbon balance. One of the key elements influencing the process of photocatalytic CO2 reduction is the presence of materials having photocatalytic properties. Therefore, exploring and developing efficient photocatalytic functional materials is the main direction of research today. This article first introduces the development history of photo-functional materials and analyzes their mechanisms in photocatalytic reactions. Then, different types of optical functional materials were classified and introduced in detail. Finally, the development trend of photo-functional materials in the catalytic reduction of CO2 was emphasized.</description>

      <title>Efficient urea electrosynthesis via coordination of the reaction rate of carbon dioxide and nitrate co&#8208;reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aic.18515</link>
      <description>Sibo Chen, Guangtong Hai, Hui Cheng, Dan Xie, Gao&#8208;Feng Chen, Liang&#8208;Xin Ding, Haihui Wang, AIChE journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399747108

                Abstract The electrochemical co&#8208;reduction of CO 2 and NO 3 &#8722; to urea is an alternative to traditional urea synthesis. However, the significant difference in the energy barriers and reaction rates for CO 2 and NO 3 &#8722; reduction restricts the efficiency of the C&#63743;N coupling. Herein, we report a strategy to coordinate the C&#63743;N coupling intermediates by unilaterally increasing the efficiency of CO 2 reduction to match that of facile NO 3 &#8722; reduction. We demonstrate this strategy using an electrochemical reaction system consisting of a Cu 2 O&#8208;loaded ordered gas&#8208;diffusion electrode, which offers a high urea yield rate of 1373.5 &#956;g h &#8722;1 mg cat. &#8722;1 at a low applied potential of &#8722;0.6 V versus RHE. This work not only provides a feasible strategy to coordinate the reductive coupling of CO 2 and NO 3 &#8722; , but also brings new insight into the reaction mechanism of urea electrosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Metal&#8722;Organic Framework Supported Low&#8208;Nuclearity Cluster Catalysts for Highly Selective Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202409270</link>

                It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of ethanol in CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2RR) because of the similar reduction potentials and lower energy barrier of possible other C2+ products. Here, we report a MOF&#8208;based supported low&#8208;nuclearity cluster catalysts (LNCCs), synthesized by electrochemical reduction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microporous Cu&#8208;based MOF, that achieves a single&#8208;product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.5% at &#8722;1.0 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) corresponding to the effective current density is 8.66 mA cm&#8722;2. By investigating the relationship between the species of reduction products and the types of catalytic sites, it is confirmed that the multi&#8208;site synergism of Cu LNCCs can increase the C&#8722;C coupling effect, and thus achieve high FE of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and operando attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy further confirmed the reaction path and mechanism of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;EtOH.</description>

      <title>Advances in electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reactors, electrolytes and catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54097/ayt64r79</link>

                With the advance of The Times, people's demand for fossil energy has greatly increased, and it is the main energy for people to develop economy and science and technology. However, the large-scale exploitation of fossil energy has led to environmental pollution and energy crisis, and the concentration of CO2 in the air continues to rise, and the greenhouse effect is becoming more and more serious. Therefore, the conversion of CO2 into the high value-added fuels and chemicals we need will be a major measure to solve environmental problems. So, converting CO2 into fuels or high value-added chemicals using CO2 electrocatalytic reduction (CO2RR) technology is an effective way to alleviate the current problems of energy and environment. In this paper, we summarize the research progress in reaction systems, electrolyte effects, and catalyst development in CO2RR experiments, focusing on the electrocatalytic aspects of CO2. Finally, we provide an outlook on the CO2 electrocatalysis industry.</description>

      <title>Cobalt&#8208;Doped Bismuth Nanosheet Catalyst for Enhanced Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Electrolyte&#8208;Free Formic acid</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202403671</link>
      <description>Rosalynn Nankya, Yuting Xu, Ahmad Elgazzar, Peng Zhu, Tae&#8208;Ung Wi, Chao Qiu, Yuge Feng, Fanglin Che, Haotian Wang, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399786047

                Electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction reaction (CO2RR) to valuable liquid fuels, such as formic acid/formate (HCOOH/HCOO&#8722;) is a promising strategy for carbon neutrality. Enhancing CO&#173;2RR activity while retaining high selectivity is critical for commercialization. To address this, we developed metal&#8208;doped bismuth (Bi) nanosheets via a facile hydrolysis method. These doped nanosheets efficiently generated high&#8208;purity HCOOH using a porous solid electrolyte (PSE) layer. Among the evaluated metal&#8208;doped Bi catalysts, Co&#8208;doped Bi demonstrated improved CO2RR performance compared to pristine Bi, achieving ~90% HCOO&#8722; selectivity and boosted activity with a low overpotential of ~1.0 V at a current density of 200 mA cm&#8208;2. In a solid electrolyte reactor, Co&#8208;doped Bi maintained HCOOH Faradaic efficiency of ~72% after a 100&#8208;hour operation under a current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2, generating 0.1 M HCOOH at 3.2 V. Density functional theory (DFT) results revealed that Co&#8208;doped Bi required a lower applied potential for HCOOH generation from CO2, due to stronger binding energy to the key intermediates OCHO* compared to pure Bi. This study shows that metal doping in Bi nanosheets modifies the chemical composition, element distribution, and morphology, improving CO2RR catalytic activity performance by tuning surface adsorption affinity and reactivity.</description>

                Abstract Um das Klima zu sch&#252;tzen, wird derzeit intensiv nach Alternativen zu fossilen Rohstoffen gesucht, die f&#252;r die Erzeugung und Speicherung von Energie und f&#252;r die Fertigung von Chemieprodukten genutzt werden k&#246;nnen. Ein Forschungsansatz dabei ist, das klimasch&#228;dliche Kohlenstoffdioxid als Rohstoff zu erschlie&#223;en. Es kann elektrochemisch durch eine homogen&#8208; oder heterogen&#8208;katalysierte Reduktionsreaktion umgewandelt werden &#8211; z. B. in Kohlenstoffmonoxid, aus dem danach chemische Energietr&#228;ger und wichtige Chemikalien f&#252;r die chemische Industrie hergestellt werden k&#246;nnen. Alternativ kann Kohlenstoffdioxid auch zu Ameisens&#228;ure umgesetzt werden, die beispielsweise als Energiespeicher geeignet ist. In diesem Beitrag wird eine M&#246;glichkeit pr&#228;sentiert, die elektrochemische CO 2 &#8208;Reduktion experimentell in der Schule durchzuf&#252;hren, um dieses Thema aus der aktuellen Forschung in den Chemieunterricht einzubinden.</description>

                The technology of carbon dioxide reduction has become a focus of research in the fields of environmental protection and sustainable development. With the exacerbation of global warming and energy crises, the issue of carbon dioxide emissions has become increasingly severe, exerting immense pressure on human society and the natural environment. In this context, carbon dioxide reduction technology has emerged as one of the important approaches to addressing climate change and energy demands. This technology involves the reaction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen or other reducing agents to produce organic compounds or fuels. Its advent not only promises to reduce carbon dioxide emissions but also to convert carbon dioxide into useful organic compounds or fuels, thereby facilitating the recycling of resources. The development of carbon dioxide reduction technology holds significant implications for addressing climate change and energy demands. By employing this technology, discarded carbon dioxide can be transformed into valuable products, reducing reliance on fossil fuels, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and providing new energy sources for sustainable development. Furthermore, carbon dioxide reduction technology has the potential to integrate with other fields such as photocatalysis and electrochemistry, further expanding its application scope and reducing costs. This paper aims to provide reference and guidance for further research and industrial application of carbon dioxide reduction technology, promoting its sustainable utilization and environmental friendliness in practical production.</description>

                The benefits of circularity and biogenic carbon storage are often overseen. This study links the circular design of buildings with prolonged biogenic carbon storage. Circularity in architectural design can involve extending the service life of a building frame, whilst forests grow back and store more carbon. Following this approach, Stora Enso has developed a mixed-use building concept with flexible and adaptable structures. Static and dynamic life cycle assessment (LCA) has been carried out to assess different scenarios, modelling and quantifying its potential benefits regarding whole life carbon. While whole life carbon is lower in all timber scenarios compared to conventional concrete buildings, dynamic LCA makes clear the benefits of carbon storage and carbon sequestration. Total emissions, considering a reference service life of 50 years, are 2,84 kg CO2-eq./m&#178; floor area/year, considering biogenic carbon storage and carbon sequestration in regrowing forests. An increase of the building lifetime to 80 years aligns with a longer rotation time of forest trees, resulting in whole life carbon of -0,09 kg CO2-eq./m&#178; floor area/year. This demonstrates that the effective implementation of built-in flexibility and adaptability can extend the service life of a building, unlocking environmental benefits of biogenic carbon storage of wood products in buildings.</description>

      <title>Progress and Perspective of Single-atom Catalysts for the Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction for Fuels and Chemicals</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54097/qxv1jb25</link>

                Electrochemical CO2 Reduction Reaction (CO2RR) presents a transformative approach for the sustainable synthesis of fuels and chemicals to address pressing environmental challenges. The efficiency and selectivity of the CO2RR largely depend on the catalyst. Among which, Single-Atom Catalysts (SACs) have surfaced as a prominent design for this reaction, offering exceptional activity and selectivity. This paper delves into the progress and perspectives of SACs in CO2RR, tracing their historical evolution, unique advantages, and underlying mechanisms. The superior atomic utilization, distinct electronic configurations, and enhanced product specificity of SACs over traditional catalysts have opened novel pathways for more efficient conversion of CO2 to potent resources. However, challenges particularly concerning the stability, scalability, and product diversity of these catalysts constitutes as major impediments. Recent innovations, from advanced characterization techniques to novel synthesis methods, are spotlighted, showcasing the strides the scientific community has made. Looking forward, this paper underscores the potential of SACs in bridging sustainable energy sources with green chemical production and discuss prospective strategies to overcome existing limitations.</description>

                The rapid development of the battery industry has brought about a large amount of waste battery pollution. How to realize the high-value utilization of waste batteries is an urgent problem to be solved. Herein, cobalt and titanium compounds (LTCO) were firstly recovered from spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) using the carbon thermal reduction approach, and plasmonic attapulgite/Co(Ti)Ox (H-ATP/Co(Ti)Ox) nanocomposites were prepared by the microwave hydrothermal technique. H-ATP had a large specific surface area and enough active sites to capture CO2 molecules. The biochar not only reduced the spinel phase of waste LIBs into metal oxides including Co3O4 and TiO2 but also increased the separation and transmission of the carriers, thereby accelerating the adsorption and reduction of CO2. In addition, H-ATP/Co(Ti)Ox exhibited a localized surface plasmon resonance effect (LSPR) in the visible to near-infrared region and released high-energy hot electrons, enhancing the surface temperature of the catalyst and further improving the catalytic reduction of CO2 with a high CO yield of 14.7 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1. The current work demonstrates the potential for CO2 reduction by taking advantage of natural mineral and spent batteries.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Analysis and Manipulation of Alkali Metal Cations at the Cathode Surface in Membrane Electrode Assembly Electrolyzers for CO2 Reduction Reactions</title>

                The stable operation of the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzers is known to be hindered by the accumulation of bicarbonate salt, which are derived from alkali metal cations in anolytes, on the cathode side. In this study, we conducted a quantitative evaluation of the correlation between the CO2RR activity and the transported alkali metal cations in MEA electrolyzers. As a result, although the presence of transported alkali metal cations on the cathode surface significantly contributes to the generation of C2+ compounds, the rate of K+ ion transport did not match the selectivity of C2+, suggesting that a continuous supply of high amount of K+ to the cathode surface is not required for C2+ formation. Based on these findings, we achieved a faradaic efficiency (FE) and a partial current density for C2+ of 77% and 230 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, even after switching the anode solution from 0.1 M KHCO3 to a dilute K+ solution (&lt;7 mM). These values were almost identical to those when 0.1 M KHCO3 was continuously supplied. Based on this insight, we successfully improved the durability of the system against salt precipitation by intermittently supplying concentrated KHCO3, compared with the continuous supply.</description>

                Abstract A key strategy for minimizing our reliance on precious metals is to increase the fraction of surface atoms and improve the metal-support interface. In this work, we employ a solvent/ligand/counterion-free method to deposit copper in the atomic form directly onto a nanotextured surface of graphitized carbon nanofibers (GNFs). Our results demonstrate that under these conditions, copper atoms coalesce into nanoparticles securely anchored to the graphitic step edges, limiting their growth to 2&#8211;5 nm. The resultant hybrid Cu/GNF material displays high selectivity in the CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) for formate production with a faradaic efficiency of ~94% at -0.38 V vs RHE and a high turnover frequency of 2.78 &#215; 10 6 h -1 . The Cu nanoparticles adhered to the graphitic step edges significantly enhance electron transfer to CO 2 . Long-term CO 2 RR tests coupled with atomic-scale elucidation of changes in Cu/GNF reveal nanoparticles coarsening, and a simultaneous increase in the fraction of single Cu atoms. These changes in the catalyst structure make the onset of the CO 2 reduction potential more negative, leading to less formate production at -0.38 V vs RHE, correlating with a less efficient competition of CO 2 with H 2 O for adsorption on single Cu atoms on the graphitic surfaces, revealed by density functional theory calculations.</description>

                With the elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the need for green and sustainable development, the need for electrochemical CO2 reduction technology is becoming more and more urgent. However, the electrochemical reduction technology still has difficulties and has not yet met the high requirements for large-scale industrialized production. In this paper, the field of electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide is deeply explored from the perspectives of technological features and applications, and the progress in this field is discussed in terms of cathode materials, anode materials, and electrolytes, and the application of electrochemical technology in the field of carbon dioxide reduction is investigated concerning the differences in the generating material and loading voltage. Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction technology can reduce carbon dioxide into utilizable industrial products by loading load voltage, and can selectively generate products such as formic acid, methanol, and methane by choosing different electrode materials and electrolytes, the selection of electrode materials and electrolytes and the selection of suitable load voltage are also the technical difficulties and the key points to realize industrial production. The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide technology has a wide range of applications in industrial production and energy saving and emission reduction, and this paper provides ideas for the understanding and further development of electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide technolog.</description>

      <title>Carbon Dioxide Gasification of Biochar: A Sustainable Way of Utilizing Captured CO2 to Mitigate Greenhouse Gas Emission</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16125044</link>
      <description>Nnamdi Ofuani, Prakash Bhoi, Sustainability. 16(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399626239

                This study proposes CO2 gasification of biochar as a potential carbon utilization pathway for greenhouse gas emission reduction. It aims to evaluate the effects of CO2 concentration on carbon and CO2 conversion and output CO yield. It also performs kinetic analysis, using the volume reaction model, to determine the activation energy and pre-exponential factor. The operating conditions utilized include gasification temperatures of 700, 800, and 900 &#176;C; inlet CO2 concentrations of 15%, 30%, 45%, and 60% by volume (N2 balance); and a CO2 flow rate of 5 L/min. Carbon dioxide gasification of biochar was performed in a fixed bed batch reactor, and the composition of the output gases was analyzed. Increases in the temperature and inlet CO2 concentration both resulted in an increase in carbon conversion, with the maximum carbon conversion of 57.1% occurring at 900 &#176;C and a 60% inlet CO2 concentration. The results also showed that CO2 conversion increased against temperature but decreased with an increasing inlet CO2 concentration. The maximum CO2 conversion of 76% was observed at 900 &#176;C and a 15% inlet CO2 concentration. An activation energy in the range of 109 to 117 kJ/mol and a pre-exponential factor in the range of 63 to 253 s&#8722;1 were determined in this study.</description>

      <title>NET ZERO EMISSIONS IN HVACR INDUSTRY</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.58532/v3bfme2p7ch1</link>
      <description>Amarish Badgujar, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399752260

                Carbon neutrality or net zero emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) or other greenhouse gases, refers to limiting emissions and eliminating greenhouse gases, thereby preventing their upsurge in the stratosphere that causes worldwide warming. Acute climate changes that could threaten the species' existence on earth. It is estimated that the sea level has augmented by 0.24 m and will be in the range of 0.3-1.5 m by 2100 due to global warming. The only way we can stop sustained and long-term sea level rise is to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide to levels close to pre-industrial levels. This requires more than maintaining carbon levels. The carbon reduction would be the first big step for humanity to prevent the rapid destruction of the environment. The paper presents the issue of global warming due to greenhouse gases and necessary actions by Heating Ventilation Air-conditioning and Refrigeration (HVACR) industries for net zero emissions, which is the demand of the future and is a must for business growth without any harm to the environment.</description>

      <title>Exploring the CO2 Electrocatalysis Potential of 2D Metal&#8211;Organic Transition Metal&#8211;Hexahydroxytriquinoline Frameworks: A DFT Investigation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29122896</link>

                Metal&#8211;organic frameworks have demonstrated great capacity in catalytic CO2 reduction due to their versatile pore structures, diverse active sites, and functionalization capabilities. In this study, a novel electrocatalytic framework for CO2 reduction was designed and implemented using 2D coordination network-type transition metal&#8211;hexahydroxytricyclic quinazoline (TM&#8211;HHTQ) materials. Density functional theory calculations were carried out to examine the binding energies between the HHTQ substrate and 10 single TM atoms, ranging from Sc to Zn, which revealed a stable distribution of metal atoms on the HHTQ substrate. The majority of the catalysts exhibited high selectivity for CO2 reduction, except for the Mn&#8211;HHTQ catalysts, which only exhibited selectivity at pH values above 4.183. Specifically, Ti and Cr primarily produced HCOOH, with corresponding 0.606 V and 0.236 V overpotentials. Vanadium produced CH4 as the main product with an overpotential of 0.675 V, while Fe formed HCHO with an overpotential of 0.342 V. Therefore, V, Cr, Fe, and Ti exhibit promising potential as electrocatalysts for carbon dioxide reduction due to their favorable product selectivity and low overpotential. Cu mainly produces CH3OH as the primary product, with an overpotential of 0.96 V. Zn primarily produces CO with a relatively high overpotential of 1.046 V. In contrast, catalysts such as Sc, Mn, Ni, and Co, among others, produce multiple products simultaneously at the same rate-limiting step and potential threshold.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Alloy Catalysts for CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202400814</link>

                The increasing anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) have a huge environmental impact, and CO2 emission reduction is already a common view in our society. Recently, selective hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol has attracted much attention because the process can effectively mitigate CO2 emissions and simultaneously produce high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels. The catalysts play a very important role in achieving high efficiency of CO2 to methanol. As one promising alternative, the alloy catalysts have demonstrated high performance in CO2 hydrogenation to methanol due to their unique geometry and electronic properties. Herein, we review the recent advances in alloy catalysts, including solid solution alloys and intermetallic compounds (mainly Cu&#8208;based, In&#8208;based, Ga&#8208;based, and other alloy catalysts) for heterogeneous catalysis of CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. Moreover, the research ideas and development prospects of alloy catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to methanol are overviewed to provide the ideas and references for the subsequent research on alloy catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation.</description>

                The development of an inexpensive, highly active catalyst is important for electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions (CO2RRs) to produce fuels and chemicals. CO2 can be converted into formate electrochemically using tin-based composites. Due to the synergistic effects induced by interfaces between metallic and oxide phases, tin species with different oxidation states may enhance the catalytic activity. Therefore, synthesizing hybrid catalysts with heterogeneous active interfaces is desirable yet difficult. Herein, a heterointerface-rich tin/tin oxide encapsulated on a nitrogen-doped carbon (Sn/SnO2&#8211;CNx) composite was prepared for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. The catalyst shows formate as the major product with a small amount of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2). The heterostructured (Sn/SnO2)15-CNx electrode showed 83.5 &#177; 2.3% faradaic efficiency and 16.7 mA/cm2 partial current density for formate production at 20 mA/cm2 applied current density in an H-type cell, which are better than those of bare SnO2 and bare Sn/SnO2 composites. The catalyst also shows good durability during CO2RR. To comprehend the experimental mechanism, density functional theory is used to compute the free energy profile of CO2-to-formate transformation on the Sn(200), SnO2 (110) surface, and Sn/SnO2 model, suggesting that the Sn/SnO2 model requires a low energy barrier compared to Sn and SnO2 to give the formate product. The high performance of the catalyst may be attributed to the presence of a heterointerface, porous configuration, high electrochemical surface area, and synergistic interaction between the catalyst and support. This work suggests that interface engineering could play a key role in the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for the CO2 reaction.</description>

                The research explored how air pollution, particularly high ozone levels, negatively impacts sensitive crops like wheat, rice, and soybeans, posing significant threats to global food security. It emphasized the long-overlooked destructive effects of ozone and emphasized the immediate need for strategies to counter these impacts amid climate change. Furthermore, the study examined the crucial role of increased carbon dioxide (CO2) levels on C4 crops, essential for global food security and biofuel production. Contrary to expectations, it challenged the belief that C4 crops inherently benefit from elevated CO2 levels in terms of enhanced photosynthesis. The study urged more experiments under changing climate conditions to refine predictions regarding crop yields. It emphasized the importance of focusing on ozone reduction, understanding how C4 crops respond to increased CO2, and assessing aerosol effects on specific crops. These insights aim to inform policies and strategies that can safeguard food security amidst rapid global economic growth and the challenges posed by climate changet.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Modeling of Carbon Fluxes over Complex Underlying Surfaces along the North Shore of Hangzhou Bay</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/atmos15060727</link>
      <description>Kaidi Zhang, Meihua Zhao, Zhenyu Zhao, Xiaoming Sheng, Yanyu Lu, Jun Gao, Atmosphere. 15(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399729515

                Urban areas contribute to over 80% of carbon dioxide emissions, and considerable efforts are being undertaken to characterize spatiotemporal variations of CO2 (carbon dioxide) at a city, regional, and national level, aiming at providing pipelines for carbon mission reduction. The complex underlying surface composition of urban areas makes process-based and physiology-based models inadequate for simulating carbon flux in this context. In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and artificial neural network (ANN) were employed to develop and investigate their viability in estimating carbon flux at the ecosystem level. All the data used in our study were derived from the long-term chronosequence observations collected from the flux towers within urban complex underlying surface, along with meteorological reanalysis datasets. To assess the generalization ability of these models, the following statistical metrics were utilized: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Our analysis revealed that the RF model performed the best in simulating carbon flux over long time series, with the highest R2 values reaching up to 0.852, and exhibiting the smallest RMSE and MAE values at 0.293 &#956;mol&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;s&#8722;1 and 0.157 &#956;mol&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;s&#8722;1. As a result, the RF model was chosen for simulating carbon flux at spatial scale and assessing the impact of urban impervious surfaces in the simulation. The results showed that the RF model performs well in simulating carbon flux at the spatial scale. The input of impervious surface area index can improve the performance of the RF model in simulating carbon flux, with R2 values of 84.46% (with the impervious surface area index in) and 83.74% (without the impervious surface area index in). Furthermore, the carbon flux in Fengxian District, Shanghai, exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity: the CO2 flux in the western part of Fengxian District was less than in the eastern part, and the CO2 flux gradually increased from the west to the east. In addition, we creatively introduced the diurnal impervious surface area index based on the Kljun model, and clarified the influence of impervious surface on the spatiotemporal simulation of CO2 flux over the complex urban underlying surface. Based on these findings, we conclude that the RF models can be effectively applied for estimating carbon flux on the complex underlying urban surface. The results of our study reduce the uncertainty in modeling carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, and make the variety of models for the carbon cycling of terrestrial ecosystems more diverse.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of CO2 Emissions, Fuel Consumption, and Fuel Costs of Diesel and Hybrid Dredger Ship Engines</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/jmse12060999</link>
      <description>Ivica Skoko, Tatjana Stanivuk, Branko Frani&#263;, Diana Bo&#382;i&#263;, Journal of marine science and engineering. 12(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399728644

                There is a consensus on the need to reduce the emissions of carbon compounds. The increase in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the maritime industry poses a serious challenge to environmental sustainability, climate change, and the operating costs of ships. This article shows how hybrid versus diesel propulsion technology for ships can help reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and fuel consumption, and how these changes can be achieved. The need to reduce exhaust emissions and the increasing need for the shipping industry to seek alternative fuels means that existing regulations for marine engines and engine emissions are being updated almost constantly and new regulations are being formulated. The cost implications of the new regulations may lead to an increase in emissions as engines with lower fuel consumption are chosen, i.e., larger marine engines. Alternative approaches are needed to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel consumption, which could ultimately lead to hybrid propulsion for ships. This paper examines the current state of greenhouse gas emissions in shipping by analyzing the CO2 emissions and operating costs of two ships of the same type with similar technical and technological characteristics and different propulsion systems to gain insight into the problem. This paper compares the reductions in CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, and fuel costs for two suction hopper dredgers with standard diesel and hybrid propulsion. The technical characteristics, CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, and price of the two ships were analyzed to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each propulsion system. The novelty of this study is that two suction hopper dredgers from the same company with similar technical&#8211;technological characteristics but different propulsion systems were used for the case study and a mathematical procedure for calculating CO2 and other greenhouse gasses was presented in comparison, all to determine to what extent and in what way the hybrid propulsion system of a ship can contribute to reductions in CO2 emissions and fuel costs at the ship and company levels compared to a standard diesel propulsion system. This comparative analysis shows how much lower CO2 emissions, fuel consumption, and fuel cost savings can be expected when using a hybrid propulsion system compared to a standard diesel propulsion system. Finally, a conclusion is drawn on the efficiency and environmental compatibility of the two systems.</description>

                To meet Greece&#8217;s commitments under the Kyoto Protocol (KP) and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), it&#8217;s crucial to dissect the primary influencers of its greenhouse gas emissions. This study utilized the logarithmic mean Divisia index method in its additive form to delve into the main drivers behind carbon dioxide emissions in Greece from 1996 to 2020. The analysis revealed that the primary catalyst for the rise in CO2 emissions was the growth in GDP. Conversely, advancements in energy efficiency, as indicated by a decrease in energy intensity, played a significant role in reducing CO2 emissions. While population growth contributed to an increase in emissions, a decline in emissions intensity showcased a reduction in emissions per unit of output or consumption. The period from 1996 to 2020 witnessed a 38% change in emissions, demonstrating the effectiveness of Greece&#8217;s environmental policies. These findings highlight the pressing need for a sustained focus on enhancing renewable energy sources (RES) penetration and ensuring comprehensive attention across all sectors to further reduce emissions.</description>

      <title>Do patents, renewable energies and energy taxes in the transport sector reduce transportation carbon emissions in the European Union?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2024.2365696</link>

                Transportation infrastructure plays a significant role in exacerbating climate change as it contributes to a substantial increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The sole economic sector in which European countries have not succeeded in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions is the transportation industry. Therefore, reducing transport-related emissions is a primary focus of emphasis in the European Union's efforts to meet its climate targets. Accordingly, this study analyzes the impact of renewable energy use, patent development, and energy taxes in the transport sector on the three different modes of transport-related emissions (aviation, road, and rail) in the 10 highest-income countries of the European Union over the period 2008&#8211;2020. The study uses the novel half-panel jackknife estimator for this analysis. The results of the estimation show that patents contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions in aviation and rail transportation, while renewable energies are only effective in rail transportation. In the context of road transportation, energy taxes are effective in mitigating CO2 emissions. Based on these findings, it is recommended that European Union policymakers promote the use of electric vehicles and eco- friendly means of transportation in road transport through energy taxes, increase the use of renewable energy sources such as biodiesel in rail transport, and reduce CO2 emissions by supporting patents that promote green innovations in the aviation sector.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Hydrogen Production &amp;amp; Storage with Renewable Energy Source and Grid Electricity Source</title>

                The role of electricity is becoming significant in our advancing world. Currently, Ireland&#8217;s energy mix heavily relies on carbon-polluting fossil fuels, posing an environmental challenge. As per the Paris Agreement 2015, Ireland is ambitiously targeting to meet net zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 2050 and a 51% reduction by 2030. The country is shifting towards renewable energy sources to generate power to achieve this target. With abundant wind energy available, Ireland can meet its goal. However, due to the intermittent availability of wind energy, an energy backup for power generation is necessary. The use of curtailed or dedicated wind for producing hydrogen gas through electrolysis, and storing it in underground salt caverns is one approach to the problem. Northern Ireland has a rich source of Permian salt deposits offering a better place to store hydrogen which can be withdrawn for electricity generation, or used as fuel in transportation sectors. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the hydrogen systems can scrutinise the environmental impact of carbon emissions. This study analyses routes to reduce the environmental impact by evaluating polluting hotspots during the construction and operation phase of the system. This paper compares the impacts of the LCA on a hydrogen system which consists of a wind energy source for hydrogen production through electrolysis, transportation in pipelines and compression before storing it in salt caverns. A comparative analysis is carried out with the LCA of the hydrogen system with an electrical grid supply source. The results show that the impacts contributed by a renewable source are less than the electricity from the grid for the island of Ireland.</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the intensification of extreme weather phenomena caused by climate change, countries around the world have begun to promote policies related to energy conservation and carbon reduction, hoping to achieve sustainable development goals by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Green buildings can effectively reduce environmental pollution and carbon dioxide emissions due to related planning and design and selection of facilities and equipment, and are regarded as an important means for the construction industry to move towards low-carbon and net-zero emissions. In the past, the research related to green building energy conservation and carbon reduction had mostly focused on the technical level, but lacked a fundamental institutional analysis of the relevant carbon reduction potential and impact brought by the current evaluation indicator system. In addition, the green building evaluation indicator system is rarely combined with practical cases for demonstration and comparison to clarify the effect of the evaluation indicator system in practice, which easily leads to the overall evaluation indicator system becoming a formality. Therefore, this study investigates the relative carbon reduction potential relationship of each evaluation indicator items in Taiwan&#8217;s current green building evaluation indicator system through systematic induction and analysis by means of expert questionnaires; meanwhile, this study also uses analysis results of expert questionnaires to clarify the carbon reduction potential circumstances that residential green buildings may have under the current evaluation indicator system. First, through literature review, this research defines the relevant content of the evaluation indicator items of Taiwan&#8217;s &amp;quot;EEWH-RS 2015&amp;quot; as four indicator orientations, nine indicator groups and thirty-one evaluation items. Then, use the AHP expert questionnaire to obtain the relative weight value of the carbon reduction potential of each indicator item under the consensus of experts and scholars, and understand that the indicator group such as &amp;quot;Daily Energy Saving&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;CO2 Reduction&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Greenery &amp;quot; and their related evaluation items are regarded as more carbon reduction potential. In addition to the current threshold indicators of the residential evaluation manual, evaluation items such as &amp;quot;ground greening&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;structural rationalization&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;building lightweight&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;roof greening&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;direct penetration design&amp;quot; are suggested to be standardized as priority or necessary evaluation indicator items in the future based on the viewpoint of energy conservation and carbon reduction. Finally, this study believes that in the future, under the active move towards net zero emissions, when selecting green building evaluation indicators, &amp;ldquo;in addition to selecting more indicators, you must choose right ones, and must choose more precisely.&amp;rdquo; In order to implement and promote the overall green building energy conservation and carbon reduction development, it is effective by encouraging the concentrated selection of items with higher carbon reduction potential, and improving the relevant planning and design content for promoting the evaluation scores of each item.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                In order to estimate the effective storage capacity of carbon dioxide in geological storage, it makes great significance to understand the seepage mechanism of flowing carbon dioxide fluid and its influence on the occurrence state in micropore. In this paper, the molecular simulation method was used to obtain the optimal configuration of kaolinite micropore and carbon dioxide molecules. The molecular dynamics method was used to simulate the flow characteristics of carbon dioxide fluid in kaolinite pores in differential depth of burial under constant pressure drop. The results show that the adsorption capacity of carbon dioxide fluid on the wall of kaolinite decreases with the increase of burial depth, the fluid density in the center of the micropore increases with the increase of burial depth, the diffusion capacity of the fluid changes significantly when the burial depth is greater than 2 km; when a constant differential pressure is applied, the flow of carbon dioxide fluid in the pore conforms to the classical poiseulle flow, the diffusion ability of the fluid increases with the increase of burial depth, nearly doubling, and the slip length also increases with the increase of burial depth; the flow behavior significantly reduces the total amount of carbon dioxide in kaolinite micropore, where the density of the first adsorption layer near the wall decreases by at least 20%, and its effect on fluid is greater than that caused by the increase of burial depth. Therefore, when estimating the effective storage capacity of carbon dioxide in geological storage, the influence of pressure drop and burial depth on the total reduction of geological sequestration should be considered at the same time. The purpose is to provide more detailed theoretical basis for carbon dioxide geological sequestration.</description>

      <title>Optimizing the integration of renewable energy sources, energy efficiency, and flexibility solutions in a multi-network pharmaceutical industry</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.54337/ijsepm.8167</link>
      <description>Francesco Ghionda, Alberto Sartori, Z. Liu, Md. Shahriar Mahbub, Francesco Pilati, Matteo Brunelli, Diego Viesi, International journal of sustainable energy planning and management. 41(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399805274

                In the contemporary landscape, roughly one-fourth of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions stem from industrial energy usage. In the industrial sector, improving the efficient and flexible coupling among different energy demands (electricity, heating, and cooling) and exploiting the integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and waste heat can lead to a drastic reduction in CO2 emissions, these are also the goals of the EU founded Horizon Europe FLEXIndustries project. This study aims to establish a cost-optimized decarbonization strategy for an energy-intensive industry, focusing on an Italian pharmaceutical company. It delves into the exploration of potential pathways and diverse energy mix configurations. The approach undertaken involves coupling a customized energy system simulation framework, specifically designed for the industrial site, with a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (MOEA). The study, conducted with a focus on the year 2024, involves a comparative analysis of three distinct scenarios. Within the intricate and challenging constraints of the industrial demo site, 13 technologies were investigated. The outcomes of each scenario identify a set of 500 Pareto optimal solutions, obtained through 40,000 simulations. These results shed light on the compelling potential of hybrid solutions, showcasing the feasibility of achieving substantial decarbonization with only moderate increases in costs. The availability of land for RES technologies, along with the existence of a biomass supply chain in the region, emerge as pivotal determinants.</description>

                This review paper addresses the growing challenges and developments in frequency control within power systems influenced by increasing penetration of renewable energy sources. It evaluates the advancements and limitations of renewable-based control technologies and explores the critical role of diverse energy storage technologies in providing fast frequency response ancillary services. Through a comprehensive analysis of global literature, this paper categorizes energy storage solutions according to their efficacy in meeting fast frequency response demands and potential for revenue generation. It reveals significant gaps in current research, which predominantly focuses on battery energy storage systems and microgrid applications, with insufficient attention to grid-scale storage solutions and innovative energy storage technologies. This analysis identifies a lack of detailed technical simulations and hybrid storage models for frequency control, as well as a minimal exploration of the environmental benefits, particularly in terms of carbon dioxide emission reductions, associated with deploying new energy storage technologies in ancillary service markets. The paper concludes by highlighting the necessity for further research incorporating detailed techno-economic evaluations and carbon dioxide reduction potential of modular, scalable energy storage technologies, facilitated by advanced network simulation models and comprehensive market analysis.</description>

      <title>Dual-circulation: influence mechanism of ETS's carbon reduction and its spatiotemporal characteristics based on intensity modified SDID model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-64250-x</link>
      <description>Xinmeng Tang, Tao Qin, Xin He, Moustafa Mohamed Nazief Haggag Kotb Kholaif, Scientific reports. 14(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399755940

                Abstract Traditional DID models overlook variations in policy intensity, causing estimation deviations from the actual situation and a limited understanding of the influence mechanism. In response, the Intensity Modified SDID Model is built to examine the influence mechanism of ETS's carbon reductions. Moreover, through model extensions, the study explores the spatiotemporal characteristics and heterogeneities of ETS&#8217;s effects. Results show that: (1) "Dual-circulation" influence mechanism is confirmed, where ETS directly contributes to carbon reductions (2.70% to 10.0% impact) through external pathways, and internal pathways continuously strengthen reduction effects, comprehensive mechanisms are thereby formed and enhanced based on interaction among internal and external pathways. (2) Reasonable ETS levels are estimated and proposed to achieve "Dual Carbon Target", constraining nationwide carbon quotas by 20 billion tons/year, increasing carbon trading volumes by 80 thousand tons/year, and elevating the carbon trading prices by 100 RMB (14 USD) per ton. (3) ETS's carbon reduction effects are identified with temporal and spatial characteristics, temporally, effects peak in the 4th period ( Event + 4 ) but diminish in the 5th period ( Event + 5 ), spatially, effects peak in areas distancing around 1000 km but disappear beyond 1500 km. (4) ETS also has synergistic effects with atmospheric pollution reduction, including industrial emissions of sulfur dioxide and smoke (dust), but are insignificant to industrial emissions of wastewater and solid waste.</description>

                As the Shanghai Free Trade Zone (FTZ) celebrates its 10th anniversary, it is crucial to examine the impact of the FTZ's construction on regional carbon emissions under the dual carbon targets of carbon neutrality and carbon peaking. Based on panel data from 282 prefecture-level cities between 2006 and 2021, this article aims to provide insight into the impact of the Free Trade Zone (FTZ) pilot policy on urban carbon dioxide emissions levels. By constructing a difference-in-differences (DID) model, this study aims to investigate the effects of the Free Trade Zone (FTZ) policy on carbon emission reduction. In order to perform a mechanism test, two more mechanistic variables&#8212;namely, technical advancement and upgrading of the industrial structure&#8212;are incorporated. According to the findings from experiments, the policy of free trade zones can effectively reduce carbon emissions from urban areas. This is primarily achieved by optimizing the industrial structure and scientific and technological mechanisms.</description>

                Abstract Under the "dual carbon" goal, the new productive forces in the industrial energy sector will become an important force in promoting the green and high-quality development of the economy and society in Hubei Province. The article comprehensively applies the Tapio decoupling model and LMDI decomposition method, and uses panel data of the industrial industry in Hubei Province from 2005 to 2021 to empirically analyze the decoupling effect of industrial carbon emissions in Hubei Province and its driving factors. Our research has found that the industrial economic growth and carbon emissions in Hubei Province roughly exhibit a complex process of changes from strong decoupling to weak decoupling, then to strong decoupling, and finally to recessive decoupling. For a considerable period of time in the future, the industrial economic growth and carbon emissions in Hubei Province will still be weakly decoupled. From the decomposition results, it can be seen that the changes in the energy intensity index and carbon intensity index are basically consistent. The decrease in energy intensity has the greatest contribution to carbon dioxide reduction, becoming a key factor driving the reduction of industrial carbon intensity in Hubei. However, the dividends brought by structural effects are still not significant. On this basis, the article proposes relevant policy recommendations, providing theoretical basis and policy basis for the high-quality development of Hubei's industry and the construction of new productive forces in the post epidemic era.</description>

      <title>Carbon emission efficiency of China&#8217;s construction industry based on super-efficiency SBM and Tobit model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3233/jcm-230010</link>

                Global warming is one of the key issues attracting international concern. The carbon dioxide emission produced by energy combustion is the main cause of the greenhouse effect, and reducing carbon emissions is considered the most effective way to deal with the greenhouse effect. The extensive production mode characterized by high energy consumption, high emission, and low efficiency in China&#8217;s construction industry intensifies the contradiction between economic development and resources and the environment, and the growth under this mode is at the expense of consuming a lot of resources and energy. The improvement of carbon emission efficiency is an effective means of achieving the goal of economic growth and carbon emission reduction simultaneously, making it necessary to accurately measure the carbon emission efficiency of the construction industry in each province, determine the influencing factors, and formulate reasonable emission reduction policies for this industry. In this study, an input-output index system of carbon emission efficiency of China&#8217;s construction industry was constructed, the carbon emission efficiency of the construction industry in each province was evaluated using the super-efficiency SBM model, and the factors affecting the carbon emission efficiency of this industry were analyzed via the Tobit model. The results showed that the average value of carbon emission efficiency of the construction industry generally showed a rising trend in a fluctuating way during the study period. From 2014 to 2022, the average carbon emission efficiency of the national construction industry presented an upward trend, from 1.122 in 2014 to 1.148 in 2022; the regional economic level (p= 0.020 &lt; 0.05) and human capital level (p= 0.000 &lt; 0.01) exerted obvious promoting effects on the carbon emission efficiency of China&#8217;s construction industry, while the urbanization development (p= 0.049 &lt; 0.05) generated evident negative effects on carbon emission efficiency of this industry. The research results have important reference values for making cross-provincial emission reduction plans for the construction industry, promoting its carbon emission efficiency, and driving the research and development of green building materials and clean energy.</description>

                Carbon dioxide capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) constitute vital measures for achieving net emissions reduction in China. Against the backdrop of the &#8220;dual carbon&#8221; initiative in China, this paper meticulously examines and analyzes the key technological principles, merits and demerits, and bottlenecks associated with CCUS carbon capture in the country&#8217;s thermal power plants at the current stage. It combines the prevailing industrial application status and the future development trajectory of pertinent technologies with considerations of industrial economic benefits and business models. Building upon this analysis, the paper summarizes the application status of CCUS technology in China&#8217;s thermal power plant industry and presents future prospects. On the technological front, the three capture methods grapple with the challenge of high costs. Therefore, there is a need to intensify efforts in developing low-cost and efficient carbon capture materials, as well as researching and practically applying low-cost oxygen generation technology. Economically, CCUS technology currently faces high costs, low returns, and certain commercial barriers, placing China in a demonstrative business model stage. To overcome these challenges and realize the economic benefits of CCUS technology, government incentives and technological innovation are imperative. These measures aim to reduce the overall cost of CCUS technology, stimulate the scale development, and foster commercialization, ultimately contributing to the achievement of China&#8217;s carbon emission reduction targets.</description>

                Abstract. The Eocene&#8211;Oligocene transition (EOT, ca. 40&#8211;33 Ma) marks a transformation from a largely ice-free to an icehouse climate mode that is well recorded by oxygen-stable isotopes and sea surface temperature proxies. Opening of the Southern Ocean gateways and decline in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have been considered as factors in this global environmental transformation and the growth of ice sheets in Antarctica during the Cenozoic. A more comprehensive understanding is still needed of the interplay between forcing versus response, the correlation among environmental changes, and the involved feedback mechanisms. In this study, we investigate the spatio-temporal variation in export productivity using biogenic Ba (bio-Ba) from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) sites in the Southern Ocean, focusing on possible mechanisms that controlled them as well as the correlation of export productivity changes to changes in the global carbon cycle. We document two high export productivity events in the Southern Ocean during the late Eocene (ca. 37 and 33.5 Ma) that correlate to proposed gateway-driven changes in regional circulation and to changes in global atmospheric pCO2 levels. Our findings suggest that paleoceanographic changes following Southern Ocean gateway openings, along with more variable increases in circulation driven by episodic Antarctic ice sheet expansion, enhanced export production in the Southern Ocean from the late Eocene through early Oligocene. These factors may have played a role in episodic atmospheric carbon dioxide reduction, contributing to Antarctic glaciation during the Eocene&#8211;Oligocene transition.</description>

                Abstract Energy audits directly provided the industrial sector with reduced energy costs and avoided emissions. Still, they also lead to far-reaching indirect and induced local, regional, and national benefits. This paper aims to present the techno-economic-environmental analysis to achieve decarbonization through implementing industrial energy efficiency at micro and macro levels. An integrated techno-economic-environmental methodology is developed. Case studies of micro-level carbon reduction efforts through industrial energy efficiency technologies are presented. The broader macroeconomic and environmental effects of technology on society are analyzed using data from 206 energy audits of industrial compressed air systems conducted over 13 years. The impacts show that energy-efficient improvements lead to direct cost savings for manufacturers, boost economic activity across sectors, and affect carbon dioxide emissions both short-term and long-term in the region. Given their extensive benefits, energy audits significantly influence policymaking. We devised a methodology to link micro-level energy audit data with macroeconomic and environmental analyses to quantify these cascading benefits. The economic scenario analysis shows that $228 M has been saved from direct industrial energy savings from implementing all compressed air recommendations in the studied periods and the region. In addition, the investment made through manufacturers would create 2,025 jobs and $383 M annually, cascading regional economic impacts. The environmental analysis shows that the regional manufacturers have directly avoided about 2.8 M metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.</description>

      <title>Biochar technology cannot offset land carbon emissions in Guangdong province, China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s44246-024-00140-1</link>
      <description>F. Wang, Wenneng Zhou, Xili Wang, Qing Zhao, Mengjie Han, Carbon research. 3(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399868647

                Abstract As a highly developed region, Guangdong province has substantial industrial emissions. Its subtropical monsoon climate, characterized by abundant hydrothermal conditions, contributes to a substantial biomass potential. The adoption of potential biomass-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, such as biochar, presents an opportunity to mitigate emissions and work towards carbon neutrality in the future. However, the current state of the land carbon balance and the CDR potential of biochar in Guangdong province remains unclear. We first calculated the land carbon balance based on inventory data. Then we estimated the CDR potential of biochar derived from agricultural residues, forestry residues, and bioenergy crops cultivated on marginal lands in Guangdong province using life cycle analysis (LCA). Results show that Guangdong province has not yet achieved carbon neutrality, with a net emission (carbon emissions remaining after offsetting by carbon sinks) of 925.63 Tg CO 2 e (CO 2 equivalent, 1Tg = 10 6 t) in 2021. Emissions from energy consumption account for the highest proportion, contributing 83.8% of total emissions. In the highest biomass utilization scenario, the maximum CDR potential of biochar derived from all biomass types reaches 84.30 Tg CO 2 e yr -1 , which could offset 9.11% of net carbon emissions in Guangdong province. Our findings provide crucial guidance for setting emission reduction targets and implementing effective mitigation strategies in Guangdong province under temperature warming.

                The integration of biotechnology in green building represents a cutting-edge approach that harnesses biological processes to enhance sustainability and efficiency in construction practices. This abstract explores modern strategies and provides examples of how biotechnology is revolutionizing green building. Biotechnology offers innovative solutions to traditional challenges in green building, leveraging biological systems to optimize resource utilization, energy efficiency, and waste reduction. By integrating living organisms, biomaterials, and biological processes into building design and construction, biotechnology enables the development of structures that are not only environmentally friendly but also adaptive and resilient.One modern approach involves incorporating living organisms such as algae, bacteria, and fungi into building materials to enhance their performance. For example, algae can be used in bio-facades to capture carbon dioxide and produce oxygen, contributing to improved indoor air quality and reducing the building's carbon footprint. Similarly, bacteria can be embedded in concrete to repair cracks autonomously, increasing the durability and lifespan of structures while minimizing maintenance needs.</description>

                Abstract An expanding body of literature discusses the importance of sufficiency for sustainable development. However, conceptual vagueness stands in the way of the practical application of sufficiency as a sustainability strategy. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of the concept of relations of enoughness , building on the general notion of &#8216;enough&#8217;, which is prevalent in sufficiency literature. Relations of enoughness will be explained based on the widespread use of sufficiency advocating for changes and reductions of individual consumption with the goal to reduce environmental impacts such as carbon dioxide emissions. Diverse uses and understandings of sufficiency can be united in a shared structure of &#8216;enough/too much/too little of X regarding Y&#8217;. Relations of enoughness can be connected to sustainability by expanding them into chains of enoughness , which serve as a conceptual foundation for the sustainable consumption corridor approach. Finally, the premises of sufficiency and potential for further research are discussed.</description>

                The quality of in situ XAS of electrochemical systems is highly sensitive to electrode disturbances, such as gas evolution and gas consumption at an electrolyte / catalyst interface. A novel in situ spectro&#8208;electrochemical X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy cell is presented as a new tool for the characterisation of gas evolving and consuming electrocatalysts at high overpotentials. By utilising a thin, porous membrane with efficient electrolyte and gas circulating loops, an improved three phase interface that enabled efficient gas supply and minimised the interference from bubble formation. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements were conducted in fluorescence mode with three experiments selected to demonstrate the cell&#8217;s performance. The first two reactions; an in&#8208;situ study of a highly active amorphous iridium oxide catalyst during the oxygen evolution reaction and an in&#8208;situ study of copper oxide during the carbon dioxide reduction reaction are used to exemplify the XAS data quality achieved under operational conditions. Thirdly, a detailed XAS investigation of a highly dispersed platinum catalyst during the oxygen reduction reaction is presented, along with comparative data in nitrogen. These measurements show the retention of oxygen on the surface of the platinum metal particles down to 0.48 V (vs. RHE), well below the platinum oxide reduction peak.</description>

                Hydrogen as a potential future energy source provides a number of benefits in terms of sustainability, high energy density, and zero emissions. The production of hydrogen via water splitting is regarded as the cleanest and sustainable process. In contrast, fossil fuel combustion causes significant environmental problems through the production and release of secondary gases such as NO x , SO 2 , and CO 2 . It is vital to focus on reducing these harmful gases. CO 2 , a major pollutant produced by the combustion of fossil fuels and various human activities, plays a central role in the greenhouse effect and contributes to global warming. It is therefore imperative to actively eliminate and mitigate CO 2 levels to preserve the global environment. MXenes and MXene&#8208;based catalysts exhibit both outstanding hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance and CO 2 reduction. In this review, recent progress is systematically examined and discussed in the preparation and utilization of MXenes as catalysts for HER and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). The discussion begins with a concise overview of the fabrication and characteristics of MXenes, followed by a comprehensive exploration of their efficacy as catalysts for HER and CO 2 RR.</description>

                Abstract Stormwater ponds are common features in urbanized landscapes because they enhance flood reduction and nutrient retention. With shallow depths and high inputs of organic matter, these systems can be highly productive with rapid oxygen depletion when thermally stratified or ice&#8208;covered. However, most of our understanding of the biogeochemistry of stormwater ponds comes from the open water period. We explored under&#8208;ice oxygen dynamics in 20 stormwater ponds in Madison, WI (USA) that were ice covered from late December to early March to investigate the drivers of bottom water oxygen saturation and the impact on the accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ). Winter anoxia was driven by ice transmissivity, winter nutrient concentrations, and precedent summer productivity. Oxygen depletion led to overall higher concentrations of greenhouse gases in pond surface waters. This research enhances our understanding of winter pond biogeochemistry and its links to summer productivity.</description>

                The reductive coupling of CO2 and alkenes represents a compelling strategy for the synthesis of carboxylic acids. In this study, we show that Ni(OAc)2 and 6,6&#8242;-Me2bpy (dmbpy) catalyze hydrocarboxylation of terminal unactivated alkenes to afford the branched 2-methyl-substituted carboxylic acids. The nickel/dmbpy speciation in solution is elucidated through electrochemical and UV&#8211;visible and NMR spectroscopic methods. A catalyst deactivation process is identified, involving competitive reduction of CO2 to CO resulting in the formation of an inactive Ni&#8211;CO complex. The Ni catalyst may be reactivated by oxidative treatment of the Ni&#8211;CO complex to release CO; however, the results highlight an important complication that can arise in reactions of Ni-catalyzed reductive coupling with CO2.</description>

      <title>A review of measurement for quantification of carbon dioxide removal by enhanced weathering in soil</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fclim.2024.1345224</link>
      <description>Matthew O Clarkson, Christina Larkin, Philipp Swoboda, Tom Reershemius, Tim Jesper Suhrhoff, Cara Nichole Maesano, James Campbell, Frontiers in climate. 6(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399807978

                All pathways which limit global temperature rise to &amp;lt;2&#176;C above pre-industrial temperatures now require carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in addition to rapid greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Novel and durable CDR strategies need to rapidly scale over the next few decades in order to reach Paris Agreement Targets. Terrestrial enhanced weathering (EW) involves the acceleration of natural weathering processes via the deployment of crushed rock feedstocks, typically Ca- and Mg-rich silicates, in soils. While models predict this has the potential to remove multiple gigatonnes of CO 2 annually, as an open-system pathway, the measurement (monitoring), reporting, and verification (MRV) of carbon removal and storage is challenging. Here we provide a review of the current literature showing the state-of-play of different methods for monitoring EW. We focus on geochemical characterization of weathering processes at the weathering site itself, acknowledging that the final storage of carbon is largely in the oceans, with potential losses occurring during transfer. There are two main approaches for measuring EW, one focused on solid phase measurements, including exchangeable phases, and the other on the aqueous phase. Additionally, gas phase measurements have been employed to understand CO 2 fluxes, but can be dominated by short-term organic carbon cycling. The approaches we review are grounded in established literature from the natural environment, but implementing these approaches for EW CDR quantification has strengths and limitations. The complexity inherent in open-system CDR pathways is navigable through surplus measurement strategies and well-designed experiments, which we highlight are critical in the early stage of the EW CDR industry.</description>

                For several years, CILAS has developed an expertise in the field of optical thin films deposition and in-situ optical monitoring techniques that enables today to successfully answer growing requests of optical coatings for astronomy and space applications, with large dimensions. In particular DIBS, PIAD and Magnetron sputtering techniques allow us to guarantee the production of dense coatings well adapted to severe environments. In this paper, we will first focus on recent projects realized for astronomy: antireflection coating on large diameter and high curvature CaF2 lenses, enhanced aluminum coating on 1.8m diameter secondary mirrors. Then we will present space-qualified enhanced silver and unprotected gold coatings dedicated to reflective surfaces (telescope mirrors, gratings) of instruments for Earth observation and black absorber coatings for parasitic light reduction. Finally, some complex optical functions developed and qualified for various space applications will be presented: mapping sources and sinks of carbon dioxide (MicroCarb) ; determining the composition of the Venus surface (Envision and Veritas) ; communicating in free-space (TELEO).</description>

                The results of the researching process of obtaining composition powder material B 4 C&#8211;TiB 2 by carbide reduction of titanium dioxide, using carbon reducing agent &#8211; carbon nanofibers, are presented. Furthermore, the results of studying of some properties of ceramics made using the synthesized powder are presented. The synthesis of composite materials was carried out in an induction crucible furnace for 20 min in the temperature range of 1200&#8211;1900 &#176;C in an argon atmosphere. It has been established that the optimum temperature of the synthesis is 1650 &#176;C, irrespective of the batch composition. The characteristics of the composite powders containing 10&#8211;30 mol. % of the TiB 2 phase have been studied. X -ray electron microscopy has revealed that the particles of the powder are predominantly aggregated. There are two peaks in the particle size distribution histograms. The part of the histogram with a smaller particle size mainly characterizes the B 4 C phase. The part of the histogram with a larger particle size characterizes the TiB 2 phase. The average particle size of the B 4 C phase is in the range of 5.3&#8211;5.5 &#181;m, and that of the TiB 2 phase is in the range of 33.6&#8211;41.9 &#181;m. The average size of 50 % of composite powder&#8217;s particles for these contents does not exceed 13.4 &#956;m. The surface area of the samples does not exceed 5 m 2 /g. The oxidation of the composite powder materials by atmospheric oxygen begins at a temperature of approximately 500 &#176;C. At the same time, when the temperature reaches 1000 &#176;C, no more than 45 wt. % of the studied powders is oxidized. Ceramics made with the synthesized powder mixture B 4 C + 30 mol. % TiB 2 by hot pressing has shown rather high values of relative density (99.0&#177;1.1 %) and fracture toughness (5.0&#177;0.2 MPa&#8729;m 0.5 ).</description>

      <title>Assessing Hydrogen Embrittlement in Pipeline Steels for Natural Gas-Hydrogen Blends: Implications for Existing Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202406.1098.v1</link>
      <description>Hesamedin Ghadiani, Zoheir Farhat, Tahrim Alam, Md. Aminul Islam, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399749217

                Governments worldwide are actively committed to achieving their carbon emission reduction targets, and one avenue under exploration is harnessing the potential of hydrogen. Blending hydrogen with natural gas is emerging as a promising strategy to reduce carbon emissions, as it burns cleanly without emitting carbon dioxide. This blending could significantly contribute to emissions reduction in both residential and commercial settings. However, a critical challenge associated with this approach is the potential for Hydrogen Embrittlement (HE), a phenomenon wherein the mechanical properties of pipe steels degrade due to the infiltration of hydrogen atoms into the metal lattice structure. This can result in sudden and sever failures when the steel is subjected to mechanical stress. To effectively implement hydrogen-natural gas blending, it is imperative to gain a comprehensive understanding of how hydrogen affects the integrity of pipe steel. This necessitates the development of robust experimental methodologies capable of monitoring the presence and impact of hydrogen within the microstructures of steel. Key techniques employed for this assessment include microscopic observation, hydrogen permeation tests, and tensile and fatigue testing. In this study, samples from two distinct types of pipeline steels used in the natural gas distribution network underwent rigorous examination. To induce hydrogen absorption, an electrochemical charging process is employed in a solution rich in H+ ions. This charging process, accomplished by a potentiostat applying a constant current, prompts the hydrogen evolution reaction at the steel specimen, acting as the cathode of the charging cell. Immediate tensile and fatigue testing following the charging process enables the evaluation of mechanical properties in comparison to non-charged samples. Different charging current densities are employed to simulate various hydrogen blend scenarios. The findings from this research indicate that charged samples exhibit a discernible decline in fatigue and tensile properties. This deterioration is attributed to embrittlement and reduced ductility stemming from the infiltration of hydrogen into the steel matrix. The extent of degradation in fatigue properties is correlated not only to the hydrogen content but also to the hydrogen permeability and diffusion rate influenced by steel&amp;rsquo;s microstructural features, with higher charging current densities indicating a more significant presence of hydrogen in the natural gas pipeline blend.</description>

                The urgent need for sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels in the transportation sector is driving research into novel energy carriers that can meet the high energy density requirements of heavy&#8208;duty vehicles without exacerbating the climate change. This concept article examines the synthesis, mechanisms, and challenges associated with oxymethylene ethers (OMEs), a promising class of synthetic fuels potentially derived from carbon dioxide and hydrogen. We highlight the importance of OMEs in the transition towards non&#8208;fossil energy sources due to their compatibility with the existing Diesel infrastructure and their cleaner combustion profile. The synthesis mechanisms, including the Schulz&#8208;Flory distribution and its implications for OME chain length specificity, and the role of various catalysts and starting materials are discussed in depth. Despite advancements in the field, significant challenges remain, such as overcoming the Schulz&#8208;Flory distribution, efficiently managing water byproducts, and improving the overall energy efficiency of the OME synthesis. Addressing these challenges is crucial for OMEs to become a viable alternative fuel, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the transition to a sustainable energy future in the transportation sector.</description>

      <title>Novel Nanocomposite Electrolytes for Sustainable Fuel Cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202453707013</link>

                An investigation has been conducted to determine whether or not novel nanocomposite electrolytes have the potential to improve the efficiency and longevity of fuel cell technology. In this investigation, nanocomposite electrolytes were manufactured by using a methodical methodology. The nanoparticles were included into polymer matrices in order to enhance the ion conductivity and mechanical strength of the electrolytes developed. The composition of nanocomposite electrolytes was improved by altering the amount of nanoparticles and polymers that were present. When compared to traditional electrolytes, the introduction of nanoparticles resulted in considerable improvements in the characteristics of the material. These enhancements included a 15% increase in ion conductivity and a 10% increase in mechanical strength. Fuel cell devices that make use of nanocomposite electrolytes have showed improved performance, with a 10% increase in power density and a 15% gain in efficiency when compared to fuel cell devices that make use of traditional electrolytes. In addition, the environmental impact assessment found that the use of nanocomposite electrolytes resulted in a two percent drop in the amount of energy used, a fifteen percent reduction in the amount of waste generated, and a twenty-five percent reduction in the amount of carbon dioxide emissions. As a result of these discoveries, the potential ofnanocomposite electrolytes to enhance the sustainability and efficiency of fuel cell technology has been brought to light. This opens the door for the creation of next-generation fuel cells that have increased performance and decreased their effect on the environment.</description>

                Mitigating global CO2 concentrations from anthropogenic sources through electrochemical conversion to value-added chemicals is the need of the hour. In this work, the fundamental concept of "Lattice Charge" has been strategically manipulated in materials to selectively produce multi-carbon products from greenhouse CO2 gas. To achieve this, a series of catalysts within a well-known ABX2 family (A = Ag, Cu; B = In, Ga, Fe; X = S, Se) have been explored, which exhibit significant activity toward the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) and results in the formation of higher carbon chemicals including C3 products, acetone, and energy-dense isopropanol (FE = 24.5 &#177; 2.5%). The Hirshfeld charge analysis technique highlighted the structure&#8211;activity correlation and the importance of the optimized lattice charge distribution as a crucial tool to manipulate the eCO2RR product in electrocatalyst designs, and the real-time in situ ATR-FTIR technique probes the crucial intermediate species adsorbed during the CO2 reduction process.</description>

                It is still a great challenge to achieve high selectivity of ethanol in CO2 electroreduction reactions (CO2RR) because of the similar reduction potentials and lower energy barrier of possible other C2+ products. Here, we report a MOF&#8208;based supported low&#8208;nuclearity cluster catalysts (LNCCs), synthesized by electrochemical reduction of three&#8208;dimensional (3D) microporous Cu&#8208;based MOF, that achieves a single&#8208;product Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 82.5% at &#8722;1.0 V (versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) corresponding to the effective current density is 8.66 mA cm&#8722;2. By investigating the relationship between the species of reduction products and the types of catalytic sites, it is confirmed that the multi&#8208;site synergism of Cu LNCCs can increase the C&#8722;C coupling effect, and thus achieve high FE of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation and operando attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy further confirmed the reaction path and mechanism of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;EtOH.</description>

      <title>Feasibility and Techno-Economic Assessment of a 128kWp Grid-Tied SPV System using HOMER Pro</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/2777/1/012008</link>
      <description>Akhlaque Ahmad Khan, Ahmad Faiz Minai, Mohammad Atif Siddiqui, Journal of physics. Conference series. 2777(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399681222

                Abstract A substantial amount of the world&#8217;s annual CO 2 emissions are attributable to the continued consumption of electricity from the grid that is generated from burning fossil fuels. Renewable energy sources could strengthen grid reliability and lessen their effect on the environment, especially in high-demand regions prone to power failures. Investigating the viability of erecting solar power plants in a subtropical area to provide the necessary electricity for an educational building that operates mainly during daylight hours is the main intent of the present study. The purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate and validate a model for enormous-scale commercial HRES applications (such as an educational institution) utilising the HOMER programme to figure out the optimal size. Minimising emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas responsible for accelerating global warming, is also of the utmost importance. Based on the simulation findings, the optimal system configuration consisted of a 120 kW converter and 400 PV arrays (each with 320 Wp = 128 kWp). For regional power generation, the most cost-effective choice is still a combination of solar panels and the grid. Findings show that a HRES can be economically feasible for installation in educational institutions at an initial capital cost of USD $0.068 million with annual operating expenses of USD $0.0447 million&#8212;a reduction of 44.11% compared to the existing system. The expected payback for this endeavour is five years. Other locations with identical climates could benefit from these results when considering the deployment of comparable technology. In order to help achieve a zero-carbon target, financial rewards could encourage governments to adopt similar schemes.</description>

      <title>Decreasing Greenhouse Gas Emissions from the Municipal Solid Waste Sector in Chinese Cites</title>

                Municipal solid waste (MSW) management systems play a crucial role in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in China. Although the government has implemented many policies to improve the MSW management system, the impact of these improvements on city-level GHG emission reduction remains largely unexplored. This study conducted a comprehensive analysis of both direct and downstream GHG emissions from the MSW sector, encompassing sanitary landfill, dump, incineration, and biological treatment, across 352 Chinese cities from 2001 to 2021 by adopting inventory methods recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The results reveal that (1) GHG emissions from the MSW sector in China peaked at 70.6 Tg of CO2 equiv in 2018, followed by a significant decline to 47.6 Tg of CO2 equiv in 2021, (2) cities with the highest GHG emission reduction benefits in the MSW sector were historical emission hotspots over the past 2 decades, and (3) with the potential achievement of zero-landfilling policy by 2030, an additional reduction of 203.7 Tg of CO2 equiv is projected, with the emission reduction focus toward cities in South China (21.9%), Northeast China (17.8%), and Southwest China (17.3%). This study highlights that, even without explicit emission reduction targets for the MSW sector, the improvements of this sector have significantly reduced GHG emissions in China.</description>

                Nowadays, the burning of fossil fuels, particularly petroleum, natural gas, and coal, meets the rising need for power and fuels for automobiles and industries.This has given rise to ecological and climate challenges.This thesis explores these issues from three distinct perspectives: (i) experimental, (ii) computational, and (iii) process simulation, with a focus on studying CO2 as an alternative and economically viable raw material.Firstly, the experimental study is focused on the synthesis, characterization, and testing of novel catalysts for electroreduction of CO2 and oxalic acid, an intermediate product of CO2.Electrocatalysts based on Cu supported by citrus (orange and lemon) peel biomass are prepared.These catalysts exhibit activity in the electrochemical reduction of CO2, emphasizing the effectiveness of biomasses, particularly orange peels, as environmentally friendly precursors for sustainable and efficient electrocatalysts.In addition, graphitic carbon nitrides/TiO2 nanotubes (g-C3N4/TiNT) composites are prepared for the electrocatalytic reduction of oxalic acid to glycolic acid, revealing superior electrocatalytic properties compared to pristine TiNT.Characterization by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electronic microscopy were performed for all the prepared electrocatalysts.Delving into the reduction of CO2 on Cu catalysts, a computational study about the synthesis of methanol on Cu(111) surface is performed by using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package.A systematic study is carried out to define the activation energies of the elementary reactions by using mGGA DF.Consequently, it is shown that the rate-controlling step is CH3O* hydrogenation and the formate pathway on Cu(111) proceeds through the HCOOH* intermediate.Finally, the process simulation, performed by using the software Aspen Plus 11 from AspenTech Inc., is based on the comparison of a catalytic (oxidation of ethylene glycol) and an electrocatalytic process (CO2 electroreduction chain) to synthesize glycolic acid.An economic analysis of the operational and investment costs reveals that the catalytic process is more cost-effective due to the current instability of electrocatalysts and proton exchange membranes, resulting in increased maintenance costs and, consequently, higher prices for the product.</description>

      <title>A CASE STUDY ON MAN-MADE HAZARDS IN THE INDIAN CONTEXT: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND THEIR MITIGATION MEASURES</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.58532/v3bice4p6ch2</link>
      <description>Awanish Kumar, Yash R. Pawar, Om Rastogi, Kamlesh Kumar Gupta, N. K. Garg, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399706757

                This paper examines the environmental consequences of man-made hazards in India and proposes strategies to mitigate their effects and prevent future disasters. While the country is no stranger to natural calamities, man-made incidents such as nuclear power plant accidents, industrial pollution, and environmental degradation due to deforestation have become increasingly prevalent. As per the WHO (World Health Organization) annual report of 2020, over seven million people die annually from air pollution caused by hazardous chemicals, while another one million perish due to waterborne diseases, primarily in developing countries with high population density. Global warming fueled by excessive fossil fuel consumption and deforestation, contributes to climate change and weather-related disasters such as droughts and floods. To address this issue the paper advocates for a reduction in fossil fuel dependency and transmission to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. The paper also highlights how we can mitigate the effect of such hazards and what measures must be taken to avoid this kind of disaster. The paper highlights the benefit of large-scale afforestation efforts, particularly in tropical rain forests, to increase Earth&#8217;s green cover and counteract the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. By implementing these mitigation measures, India can move towards a more sustainable and environmentally resilient future.</description>

                Under the background of the &#8220;dual carbon&#8221; target, exploring the pathway of efficient geological storage and high energy utilization of CO2 is a hot issue in CO2 emission reduction research. Under the coupling effect of high geopathic stress in deep rock layers and thermal stress generated during the geological sequestration of CO2, CO2 infiltration into coal rock changes the ambient temperature around the rock, while thermal diffusion effects cause damage to the rock and influence fracture expansion. In the present study, CO2-water&#8211;rock coupling test system and characterization of fissure surface roughness were conducted to analyze the rock&#8217;s mechanical properties, damage, and fracture evolution. Modeling of the equivalent fissure was employed to reveal the heat transfer mechanism between the rock matrix and CO2. The results obtained illustrate that the rock samples coupled with CO2 exhibited remarkable changes in mechanical properties. These changes include an increase in the number of pores, enhanced inter-pore connectivity, and a planar type of surface roughness in the fissures, ultimately resulting in an increase in conductivity. Conversely, the remaining rock samples displayed poor mechanical properties and surface fracture connectivity. As pressure decreased, the heat transfer coefficient decreased from 86.9 W/m2&#183;K to 57.5 W/m2&#183;K, accompanied by a temperature drop from 33.6 &#176;C to 30.6 &#176;C, demonstrating a proportional relationship between pressure and the heat transfer coefficient. Furthermore, the flow rate gradually increased with the rise in CO2 pressure, indicating denser flow lines with faster flow rates. At 15 MPa, CO2 exhibits enhanced mobility.</description>

                Formic acid (HCOOH) is a highly energy&#8208;efficient product of electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Bismuth&#8208;based catalysts have shown promise in the conversion of CO2 to formic acid, but there is still a great need for further improvement in selectivity and activity. Herein, we report the preparation of Bi nanosheets decorated by cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeOx) with high Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio and rich oxygen vacancies. The CeOx nanoparticles affect on the electronic structures of bismuth, enhance the CO2 adsorption, and thus promote the CO2RR properties of Bi nanosheets. Compared with elemental Bi nanosheets, the hetero&#8208;structured CeOx/Bi nanosheets exhibit much higher activity over a wide potential window, showing a current density of 16.1 mA cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency of 91.1% at &#8722;0.9 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode.</description>

      <title>A Pore-Scale Phase Field Model for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;Fluid&#8211;Basalt Interactions</title>

                Basalt is a suitable target area for CO2 storage. Clarifying the evolution of the pore structure during CO2&#8211;fluid&#8211;basalt interactions is a crucial element in the preparation of a CO2 geologic storage operation. In this study, a pore-scale phase field model is proposed to simulate the CO2&#8211;fluid&#8211;basalt interaction process of Snake River Plain basalt. Our model is suitable for complex multimineral natural rocks, and the initial mineral distribution before the reaction can be completely based on a real 3D rock image without the need to simplify the mineral geometry. The simulation results demonstrate that after 120 days of dissolution&#8211;precipitation reaction, the volume of secondary minerals (3.75%) exceeds that of dissolved minerals (2.01%), leading to a reduction in porosity by 1.74%. The pore structure of the basalt changes significantly, and the connectivity is obviously reduced. The effects of temperature and pressure on the reaction rate were examined to guide site selection for CO2 sequestration. The results show that increasing temperature and pressure can accelerate the reaction rate, but the impact of pressure on the reaction rate is negligible compared to the significant influence of temperature. Therefore, an area with a high geothermal gradient is conducive to geological sequestration.</description>

                ABSTRACT The use of CO2 sensors has been reported as an effective tool in the early detection of signs of deterioration, allowing good accuracy in decision-making about the quality of stored grains. The objective of this study was to quantify the CO2 levels produced by maize grains stored at ambient temperature in a prototype silo, with initial moisture contents of 14, 16 and 18% w.b., and to evaluate the quality of the product over time and the technical breakage. Analyses of moisture content, ash, proteins, lipids, Hue Angle (color), germination and electrical conductivity were performed. Inside the silos, the amount of CO2, relative air humidity and temperature were monitored every hour. Grain quality evaluations were carried out at four storage times (0, 30, 60 and 90 days). A completely randomized design in a 3 &#215; 4 factorial scheme with six replicates was used. Grains with higher moisture contents showed higher technical breakage and losses associated with CO2 emissions. Moisture content, protein, lipids, germination, bulk density, lightness and chroma decreased over time, while the electrical conductivity increased, resulting in greater damage to membranes and loss of quality of maize grains. Monitoring of CO2 in the grain mass is a good tool to assess the quality of grain, and higher initial moisture content caused greater level of CO2 emission and reduction in quality of maize grains.</description>

      <title>Unlock CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction Reaction Pathways in Aprotic Li-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Batteries with In Situ Isotope-Labeled Spectroscopy and Theoretical Calculations</title>

                The CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) pathway significantly dictates the reversibility and overpotential of aprotic Li-CO2 batteries; however, it has remained incompletely understood due to the lack of direct in situ spectroscopic evidence. Herein, the Li-CO2RR pathways at the model Au | dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) interface are interrogated using a combination of in situ isotope-labeled spectroscopy techniques and theoretical calculations. This obtained direct spectroscopic evidence presents that the primary CO2RR proceeds through the CO2-to-CO pathway (i.e., 2Li+ + 2CO2 + 2e&#8211; &#8594; CO + Li2CO3) initiated at a low overpotential (ca. 2.1 V vs Li/Li+), and the CO2-to-Li2C2O4 pathway (i.e., 2Li+ + 2CO2 + 2e&#8211; &#8594; Li2C2O4) initiated at a high overpotential (ca. 1.7 V vs Li/Li+), where the potential-dependent pathways critically depend on the coverage of LiCO2 intermediates. Simultaneously, the entire Li-CO2RR process is also accompanied by parasitic reactions to form gaseous C2H4 with COOH* as the crucial intermediate, which is induced by the H+-abstraction reaction between the reactive LiCO2 intermediate and the DMSO solvent. These fundamental insights enable us to establish a molecular picture for Li-CO2RR pathways in aprotic media and will serve as a crucial guideline for reversible Li-CO2 electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Views of the Electric Double Layer in Electrochemical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction: Continuum Models vs Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c03469</link>
      <description>Evan Johnson, Sophia Haussener, Journal of physical chemistry. C./Journal of physical chemistry. C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399702195

                In the field of electrochemical CO2 reduction, both continuum models and molecular dynamics (MD) models have been used to understand the electric double layer (EDL). MD often focuses on the region within a few nm of the electrode, while continuum models can span up to the device level (cm). Still, both methods model the EDL, and for a cohesive picture of the CO2 electrolysis system, the two methods should agree in the regions where they overlap length scales. To this end, we make a direct comparison between state-of-the-art continuum models and classical MD simulations under the conditions of CO2 reduction on a Ag electrode. For continuum modeling, this includes the Poisson&#8211;Nernst&#8211;Planck formulation with steric (finite ion size) effects, and in MD the electrode is modeled with the constant potential method. The comparison yields numerous differences between the two modeling methods. MD shows cations forming two adsorbed layers, including a fully hydrated outer layer and a partial hydration layer closer to the electrode surface. The strength of the inner adsorbed layer increases with cation size (Li+ &lt; Na+ &lt; K+ &lt; Cs+) and with more negative applied potentials. Continuum models that include steric effects predict CO2 to be mostly excluded within 1 nm of the cathode due to tightly packed cations, yet we find little evidence to support these predictions from the MD results. In fact, MD shows that the concentration of CO2 increases within a few &#197; of the cathode surface due to interactions with the Ag electrode, a factor not included in continuum models. The EDL capacitance is computed from the MD results, showing values in the range of 7&#8211;9 &#956;F cm&#8211;2, irrespective of the electrolyte concentration, cation identity, or applied potential. The direct comparison between the two modeling methods is meant to show the areas of agreement and disagreement between the two views of the EDL, so as to improve and better align these models.</description>

      <title>Deriving an Efficient and Stable Microenvironment for a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MEA Electrolyzer by Reverse Osmosis</title>

                In a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer based on a cation-exchange membrane, achieving an efficient and stable CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is challenging because the transport of protons, cations, and electro-osmotic water from the anode changes the balance of ions. Herein, we derived a microenvironment for stable and efficient CO2RR performance by using two strategies. First, a mixture of carbon and anion-exchange ionomer buffer layers is used to hold cations while managing water in local alkaline media. The second strategy involves pressurizing only the cathode side, resulting in a high local CO2 concentration and enhancing the reverse osmosis phenomenon. The synergistic effects of these two strategies create an efficient microenvironment by managing water and cations, leading to a stable and efficient CO2RR operation. Our approach of reverse osmosis to balance cations and water is viable for industrial applications because pressurized CO2 and MEA systems are efficient processes that can be commercialized.</description>

      <title>Capacity of Forests and Grasslands to Achieve Carbon Neutrality in China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/f15061060</link>
      <description>Yonge Zhang, Yang Zhao, Qingwei Chen, Yongfeng Zhu, Bo Liu, Xiaoming Zhang, Xijie Yin, Forests. 15(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399802916

                Forests and grasslands play an important role in carbon cycling. They not only absorb CO2 from the air through vegetation biomass and soil carbon sinks, but also reduce and control the horizontal transport of soil carbon (i.e., reinforcing soil carbon storage via soil conservation), thus avoiding erosion-induced CO2 emissions. In this study, vegetation biomass and soil carbon sinks, soil carbon reinforcement and reduced carbon emissions via soil conservation by forests and grasslands were quantified on the scale of the whole of China. The analysis was based on the distribution of biomass and the soil carbon pool and soil erosion rates derived from national surveys, as well as carbon density values from field surveys and literature. In 2021, forests and grasslands in China generated 394.18 Mt C/year (y) of steady-state carbon sinks through vertical biomass and soil absorption. The biomass carbon sinks of grasslands, and those of leaves, twigs, flowers and fruits of the forests, were not taken into account when quantifying the stable biomass sink, because they can become net producers of CO2 due to seasonal withering and carryover, or they can form soil organic carbon as potential soil carbon sinks. The amount of horizontal soil carbon reinforcement in China&#8217;s forests and grasslands in 2021 was 20.31 Mt C/y, which was positively correlated with the reduction in the water erosion area; consequently, vertical emissions of approximately 14.89&#8211;29.78 Mt of CO2 into the atmosphere were avoided. Overall, in 2021, China&#8217;s forests and grasslands absorbed atmospheric CO2 and reduced emissions by 1.46&#8211;1.47 Gt CO2/y, equivalent to approximately 13% of China&#8217;s annual fossil CO2 emissions. This study demonstrates the fact that the adoption of forest and grassland measures sequesters carbon in soil and biota and reduces the risks of CO2 emissions by both vertical and horizontal paths, which is important for achieving carbon neutrality and mitigating climate change.</description>

                The European &#8220;Horizon 2020&#8221; LEILAC and DESTINY projects are two examples of electrification in the cement industry. LEILAC shows how resistance heating can be applied as a substitution of an existing gas-supplied process. The use of microwave heating in the DESTINY project illustrates the downscaling of the production paradigm towards small on-site-of-demand cement production, allowing a further reduction in CO2 emission.</description>

      <title>How much methane removal is required to avoid overshooting 1.5&#176;C?</title>

                Abstract Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. With an atmospheric lifetime of around a decade, methane mitigation starting immediately has the potential to avoid substantial levels of additional warming by mid-century. In addition to the methane emissions reductions that are necessary to limit warming, we address the question of whether technological methane removal can provide additional benefits by avoiding global mean surface temperatures exceeding 1.5&#176;C above pre-industrial---the high-ambition Paris Agreement climate goal. Using an adaptive emissions methane removal routine in a simple climate model, we successfully limit peak warming to 1.5&#176;C for overshoots of up to around 0.3&#176;C. For substantially higher overshoots, methane removal alone is unable to limit warming to 1.5&#176;C, but in an extreme scenario could limit peak warming by an ensemble median 0.7&#176;C if all atmospheric methane was removed, requiring huge levels of net removal on the order of tens of petagrams cumulatively. The efficacy of methane removal depends on many emergent properties of the climate system, including climate sensitivity, aerosol forcing, and the committed warming after net zero CO$_2$ (zero emissions commitment). To avoid overshooting 1.5&#176;C in the low-overshoot, strong-mitigation SSP1-1.9 scenario, a median cumulative methane removal of 1.2 Pg CH$_4$ is required, though this may be much higher if climate sensitivity is high or the zero emissions commitment is positive, and in these cases may require ongoing methane removal long after peak warming in order to stabilise warming below 1.5&#176;C.</description>

                This study aims to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from China&amp;#039;s sludge treatment industry and explore the potential of novel technologies to mitigate these emissions, promoting sustainable sludge management practices. Using a life cycle assessment approach, the total GHG emissions from sludge treatment in 2017 were estimated at 18.54 Mt CO2-eq, with significant regional variations. Incineration contributed the highest emissions (1,011.53 kg CO2-eq/t dry sludge), followed by landfill (717.51 kg CO2-eq/t) and land application (276.41 kg CO2-eq/t). The uneven distribution of emissions across cities highlights the need for targeted mitigation strategies that consider local sustainability challenges. Principal component analysis revealed that economic factors and treatment scale significantly influence emissions, emphasizing the importance of integrating sustainability goals with economic development. To reduce the carbon footprint of sludge treatment and enhance sustainability, the mitigation potential and costs of various technologies were evaluated, including thermal conversion, anaerobic digestion, hydrothermal processes, and wet oxidation. These technologies offer GHG emission reductions ranging from 0.09 to 0.46 t CO2-eq/t dry solids compared to conventional methods, while also promoting resource recovery and circular economy principles. However, further optimization is necessary to enhance their environmental and economic performance, ensuring long-term sustainability. By implementing these technologies and adopting optimization strategies, China&amp;#039;s sludge treatment industry can significantly contribute to achieving the country&amp;#039;s carbon neutrality goal and fostering sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Electrochemistry in Action: Iron and Steel Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/2.f06242if</link>
      <description>Trevor Michael Braun, Camilla Wallace, Quoc Pham, Sumit Nijhawan, Christopher L. Alexander, &#152;The &#156;Electrochemical Society interface. 33(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399685375

                Steel is one of the most manufactured materials in modern society, with 1.9 billion metric tons produced annually for use in building materials, vehicles, wind-turbines, and appliances, among many other applications. As you might expect for something so ubiquitous, the technology used to manufacture steel is also quite mature, having been first identified over 4,000 years ago and heavily industrialized in the 19th century. The general approach is to mine iron ore from the earth&#8217;s crust and refine that ore to metallic iron (i.e., ironmaking) which is then combined with carbon and other elements to make steel products (i.e., steelmaking). However, conventional steel manufacturing relies primarily on carbon-based fuels, such as coal, to create the high temperatures (&#8776; 1600&#176;C) required for the process and can emit as much as 2.2 tons of CO2 per ton of crude steel produced.1 The iron ore reduction step accounts for 90% of CO2 emissions associated with steel production. The heightened effort to decarbonize industrial process and reverse climate change is putting pressure on this 600+ year-old technology to shift to lowcarbon alternatives, especially considering that the steel industry is responsible for &#8776; 7% of all global CO2 emissions annually.</description>

                Aqueous solutions containing both the strong oxidant, peroxydisulfate (S2O82&#8210;), and the strong reductant, oxalate (C2O42&#8210;), are thermodynamically unstable due to the highly exothermic homogeneous redox reaction: S2O82&#8210; + C2O42&#8210; &#174; 2 SO42&#8210; + 2 CO2 (DG0 = &#8722;490 kJ/mol). However, at room temperature, this reaction does not occur to a significant extent over the timescale of a day due to its inherently slow kinetics. We demonstrate that the S2O82&#8210;/C2O42&#8210; redox reaction occurs rapidly, once initiated by the Ru(NH3)62+-mediated 1e&#8211; reduction of S2O82&#8210; to form S2O83&#8226;&#8210; at a glassy carbon electrode. Theoretically, the mediated electrochemical generation of a single molecule of S2O83&#8226;&#8210; is capable of initiating an autocatalytic cycle that consumes both S2O82&#8210; and C2O42&#8210; in bulk solution. Several experimental demonstrations of S2O82&#8210;/C2O42&#8210; autocatalysis are presented. Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements demonstrate that CO2 is generated in solution for at least 10 minutes following a 30-s initiation step during which S2O83&#8226;&#8210; is generated. Quantitative bulk electrolysis of S2O82&#8210; in solutions containing excess C2O42&#8210; is initiated by electrogeneration of immeasurably small quantities of S2O83&#8226;&#8210;. Capture of CO2 as BaCO3 during electrolysis additionally confirms the autocatalytic generation of CO2. First- principles density functional theory calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and finite difference simulations of cyclic voltammetric responses are presented that support and provide additional insights into the initiation and mechanism of the S2O82&#8210;/C2O42&#8210; autocatalytic reaction. Preliminary evidence indicates that autocatalysis also results in a chemical traveling reaction front that propagates into the solution normal to the planar electrode surface.</description>

                Ecopetrol, based on the results obtained in the study "The Effect of Diesel Properties on the Emissions of Particulate Matter" (Bello et al., 2000), reformulated the diesel fuel distributed in Bogot&#225;, becoming it lighter and with a lower sulfur content. In order to evaluate the environmental benefits that the reformulation of diesel fuel generate in Bogot&#225;, Instituto Colombiano del Petr&#243;ledo (ICP), with the assistance of Emissions Research and Measurement Division (ERMD) from Environment Canada, arranged a research project to determine the changes in CO, THC, NOx, CO2 and Particulate Matter emissions. The research program was developed in two steps. First one, developed in Bogot&#225;, involved a fleet test with 15 public service buses that normally operate in Bogota&#8217;s Savannah, using a portable emissions sampling technology developed for ERMD (DOES2) and following a representative transient driving cycle. Second step, carried out in ERMD&#8217;s Heavy-Duty Engine Emissions Laboratory in Ottawa, tested a 1995 caterpillar 3406E 324,5 kW (435 HP) diesel truck engine on the same samples of Colombian diesel fuels used in the fleet tests performed in Bogot&#225;, baselining the tests with a Canadian Commercial Low Sulfur Diesel Fuel. The two commercial Colombian diesel fuels used had the following properties: High Sulfur Diesel (HSD), with 3000 ppm (0,3 wt%) of sulfur and a Final Boiling Point (FBP) of 633 K and the new reformulated diesel fuel, with 1000 ppm (0,1 wt%) of sulfur and FBP of 613 K, which is currently been distributed in Bogot&#225;. Fleet test show small reduction on CO, THC and TPM, and small increments on CO2 and NOx, but with not statistically significant results, while engine testing shows an strong reduction of 40,8% in TPM when you use the new reformulated diesel fuel (0,1wt% of sulfur) instead of high sulfur diesel.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Boundary Layer in Pulsed CO2 Electrolysis</title>

                Electrochemical reduction of CO2 poses a vast potential to contribute to a defossilized industry. Despite tremendous developments within the &#64257;eld, mass transport limitations, carbonate salt formation, and electrode degradation mechanisms still hamper the process performance. One promising approach to tweak CO2 electrolysis beyond today&#8217;s limitations is pulsed electrolysis with potential cycling between an operating and a regeneration mode. Here, we rigorously model the boundary layer at a silver electrode in pulsed operation to get profound insights into the dynamic reorganization of the electrode microenvironment. In our simulation, pulsed electrolysis leads to a significant improvement of up to six times higher CO current density and 20 times higher cathodic energy e&#64259;ciency when pulsing between &#8208;1.85 and &#8208;1.05 V vs SHE compared to constant potential operation. We found that elevated reactant availability in pulsed electrolysis originates from alternating replenishment of CO2 by di&#64256;usion and not from pH&#8208;induced carbonate and bicarbonate conversion. Moreover, pulsed electrolysis substantially promotes carbonate removal from the electrode by up to 83 % compared to constant potential operation, thus reducing the risk of salt formation. Therefore, this model lays the groundwork for an accurate simulation of the dynamic boundary layer modulation, which can provide insights into manifold electrochemical conversions.</description>

      <title>Recent Progress and Challenges in Hybrid Water Electrolysis through Economic Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsmaterialslett.4c00676</link>

                Water electrolysis is a sustainable method of hydrogen production with low levels of CO2 emissions. However, the problem of high economic costs must be resolved. Hybrid water electrolysis (HWE), derived by replacing the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction, emerges as an alternative method to reduce power consumption. Recent studies on HWEs have focused on reporting cell potential reductions, but their impact on hydrogen production costs is still unclear. In this paper, power consumption and levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) were evaluated to understand the economic impact of HWEs. Among various HWEs, HzOR showed an excellent energy consumption reduction (43.3 kWh/kg) resulting in the lowest LCOH ($1.92 kg&#8211;1). These results prove one of the most effective alternatives to water electrolysis in its current state. Although other HWEs show only small reductions in energy consumption and LCOH in their current state, these reactions still show high potential to reduce energy consumption and LCOH.</description>

      <title>The Efficacy of CO2 Vaginal Laser in the Treatment of Recurrent, Post-Coital and Interstitial Cystitis: A Multicentric Prospective Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm13123550</link>
      <description>Daniela Luvero, Adele Silvagni, Anna Maria Angioli, Maurizio Filippini, Francesco Plotti, Roberto Montera, Carlo De Cicco Nardone, Eliza Notaro, Francesco Branda, Roberto Angioli, Journal of clinical medicine. 13(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399730626

                Background: This multicentric prospective study was carried out at Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio Medico and Ospedale di Stato of St. Marino Republic. Between 1 January 2019, and 31 December 2022, all pre- and post-menopausal women diagnosed with recurrent, post-coital, and interstitial cystitis at both centers were included in the study. The main aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of vaginal CO2 laser treatment, alone or combined with intravesical hyaluronic acid instillations, in managing cystitis symptoms, such as dysuria, pollakiuria, and urgency, across the entire patient cohort. The secondary objective was to investigate the reduction in number of annual cystitis episodes post-treatment. Methods: Each woman underwent three to four sessions of micro-ablative CO2 vaginal laser treatment. A follow-up examination was conducted 12 months after the final laser session (up to December 2023), during which a post-treatment VAS assessment evaluated dysuria, daily pollakiuria, and urgency. The enrolled patients recorded the number of cystitis episodes experienced during the 12-month pre- and post-treatment period. Results: Results indicated the laser&#8217;s efficacy in reducing the total number of cystitis episodes per year and an improvement in symptoms up to one year post-treatment. Greater efficacy of the CO2 laser treatment, particularly when combined with intravesical hyaluronic acid instillation, was observed in both pre- and post- menopausal women. Conclusions: Fractional CO2 laser therapy represents a safe and efficacious, non-hormonal approach for pre- and post-menopausal women diagnosed with recurrent, post-coital, and interstitial cystitis</description>

                The synthesis, physicochemical, and functional properties of composite solids resulting from the surface spread of oxidized indium species onto nanoplatelets of anatase were investigated. Both the size and the interaction between the indium- and titanium-containing components control the functional properties. In the reduction of CO2 to CO, the best samples have an indium content between ca. 2 and 5 mol % and showed an excess rate over the photo and thermo-alone processes above 33% and an energy efficiency of 1.3%. Subnanometric (monomeric and dimeric) indium species present relatively weak thermal catalytic response but strong thermo-photo promotion of the activity. A gradual change in functional properties was observed with the growth of the indium content of the solids, leading to a progressive increase of thermal activity but lower thermo-photo promotion. The study provides a well-defined structure&#8211;activity relationship rationalizing the dual thermo-photo properties of the catalysts and establishes a guide for the development of highly active and stable composite solids for the elimination and valorization of CO2.</description>

      <title>Performance assessment of large-scale rooftop solar PV system: a case study in a Malaysian Public University</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-024-06007-9</link>

                Abstract Adopting rooftop solar PV systems in various domestic and non-domestic sectors (including commercial, industrial, and agricultural) exhibits their commitment to green energy ventures. This study intends to evaluate the effectiveness of a grid-connected solar system that has been installed so far: a 6.9 MW p photovoltaic (PV) system implemented at University Tun Hussein Onn (UTHM) in Batu Pahat, Johor. This green energy system was installed as a part of the Self-Consumption (SELCO) program utilizing a Supply Agreement for Renewable Energy (SARE) contract. To assess the mounted energy system's efficiency, performance monitoring was carried out between December 2021 and November 2022. By evaluating the enactment of the 6.9 MW p solar system at UTHM, this present work has attempted to compile the achievement of implementation of self-consumption in terms of performance analysis and financial benefits to consumer. Based on International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61724 standard, this study also investigates several performance characteristics of the PV system, such as final yield, clearness index (CI), array yield, PV module efficiency, inverter efficiency, reference yield, and capacity factor (CF) performance ratio (PR). Moreover, an assessment of Carbon Dioxide ( $${CO}_{2})$$     CO  2   )    avoidance was also conducted to quantify the amount of $${CO}_{2}$$    CO  2   reduction achieved. In addition, the self-consumption ratio and self-sufficiency ratio pattern for solar power plant in UTHM has been assessed. The monthly clearness index at the project location from December 2021 to November 2022 ranges from 0.63 to 0.66. The PV system was monitored throughout this time and generated 8529 MWh of energy. The installed PV system has shown an efficiency of 11.86%, a final yield of 108.28%, and a PR of 0.78, respectively. Further, the installed 6.9 MW p PV system at UTHM will cut $${CO}_{2}$$    CO  2   emissions by 5450 tons annually. The 6.9 MWp solar PV system is also estimated to reduce 25.1 RM mil in 25 years. Making the system larger to 6.9 MW p would reduce the consumption from the grid during the week, makes it possible to achieve self-consumption levels of up to 100% and self-sufficiency of this solar plant is relatively low ranges from 22 to 35%. The research finding bridges the gap between policy makers, investors, and the public regarding acceptance of the large-scale Self-Consumption (SELCO) and strengthen the strategic collaborations between solar service provider and educational bodies to support of the government&#8217;s agenda to achieve carbon emission intensity reduction in Malaysia.

                Both biotechnological and electrochemical processes have economic and environmental significance. In particular, biotechnological processes are very specific and stable, while electrochemical processes are generally very atom-and energy-efficient. A combination of these processes is therefore a potentially important approach to intensify biotechnological processes. In this paper, the relevant options for process integration are presented, key performance indicators for quantitative evaluation are given, and an evaluation based on performance indicators is carried out using the example of the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to formate and the subsequent biotechnological conversion to the biopolymer polyhydroxybutyrate.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Forecast of Energy Demand Towards a Sustainable Future in Renewable Energies focused on Geothermal Energy in Peru (2020&#8211;2050): A LEAP Model Application</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202404.1366.v1</link>
      <description>D. Torres, Luis Felipe Mazadiego, David Bolonio, Ram&#243;n Rodr&#237;guez Pons-Esparver, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399749915

                The purpose of the evaluation of the Peruvian energy generation system is to project the electricity generation and demand until the year 2050. To achieve this, three alternative scenarios have been defined and analyzed using the LEAP (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning) software. The scenarios are as follows: the first one, Business-as-Usual scenario, based on normal trends according to historical data and referencing projections made by Peruvian state entities; the second one is focused on Energy Efficiency, the highlighted characteristic is taking into consideration the efficient conditions in transmission and distribution of electric energy; and the third one, centered on Geothermal Energy, focused on the development of this type of energy source and prioritizing it. The primary purpose of this analysis is to identity advantages and disadvantages inherent in each scenario in order to get the best of each one. In this way, the intention is to propose solutions based on Peru&amp;rsquo;s national reality or possible uses of the country&amp;rsquo;s energy potential to supply its energy demand. Currently, Peru&amp;rsquo;s energy demand relies on fossil fuels, hydraulic, and thermal energy. However, there is the possibility of transforming this system into a sustainable one, by strengthening existing and growing energy sources such as solar and wind energy, and new technologies for hydraulic and thermal energy, in addition to considering geothermal energy as the main energy source in the third scenario. The new system mentioned satisfactorily indicate that the CO2 equivalent emissions decrease significantly in the third scenario, with a 15.8% reduction compared to the first scenario and a 9.7% reduction in comparison to the second. On the other hand, the second scenario shows a 5.6% decrease in CO2 emissions compared to the first, resulting from improvements in technology and energy efficiency without requiring significant modifications or considerable investments, as in the third scenario.</description>

                Annual climate conferences draw public attention to the urgent need to ecologize CO2-neutral fuel systems and recognize that global temperature increases must be limited to less than 2 &#176;C to avoid dangerous climate change. Based on the projections of the International Panel on Climate Change, it is now widely accepted that in order to stay within this temperature range, CO2 emissions need to be reduced by 80% by 2050. Furthermore, developing countries most affected by climate change are pushing for a reduction (as opposed to stabilization) of atmospheric CO2 equivalent levels from ~450 ppm to 350 ppm in order to stabilize at a 1.5 &#176;C temperature rise. Electricity plays an important role in our everyday life, and its consumption is constantly increasing. Its traditional production based on fossil fuels has huge environmental problems, such as pollution of the atmosphere with greenhouse gases with further global consequences - the greenhouse effect. To overcome these effects, technologies based on non-conventional energy sources such as solar energy, wind energy, biofuels, etc. are being implemented. While solar photovoltaic and thermal energy are attractive, the need for bioenergy is becoming inevitable to replace fossil fuels. Natural photosynthesis offers the means for this, primarily through the use of plants. Land plants have already been used as a source of bioenergy, and this use will increase in the future, despite a number of associated problems. This study concerns a new technology of electricity production, namely, biotechnology, that is, the use of aqueous extracts of various plant resources. Some plants in nature have the ability to accumulate in their cells biologically active compounds capable of creating an electrolytic environment, in fact they are suitable for the production of electricity, which can be amplified.</description>

                Simply expressed, the circular economy implies that the people living on Earth should reuse and recycle the products that are currently in use as long as possible and reduce the waste produced, thus reducing CO2 emissions. The latter goal is fundamental from the perspective of mitigating the well-known greenhouse effect and the consequent global warming observed at the planetary scale. Under these conditions, advanced electrodeposition processes can play a fundamental role in the optimization of materials use and in the reduction of the energetic footprint for a wide variety of industrial processes. The aim of the present paper is precisely to suggest how this is possible, showing readers the potential that electrodeposition holds for efficient manufacturing of many different products that have a huge significance for industry.</description>

      <title>Altering the CO2 electroreduction pathways towards C1 or C2+ products via engineering the strength of interfacial Cu&#8208;O bond</title>

                Copper (Cu)-based catalysts have established their unique capability for yielding wide value-added products from CO2. Herein, we demonstrate that the pathways of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can be rationally altered toward C1 or C2+ products by simply optimizing the coordination of Cu with O-containing organic species (squarate (C4O4) and cyclohexanhexanone (C6O6)). It is revealed that the strength of Cu-O bonds can significantly affect the morphologies and electronic structures of derived Cu catalysts, resulting in the distinct behaviors during CO2RR. Specifically, the C6O6-Cu catalysts made up from organized nanodomains shows a dominant C1 pathway with a total Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 63.7% at -1.0 V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). In comparison, the C4O4-Cu with an about perfect crystalline structure results in uniformly dispersed Cu-atoms, showing a notable FE of 65.8% for C2+ products with enhanced capability of C-C coupling. The latter system also shows stable operation over at least 10 h with a high current density of 205.1 mA cm-2 at -1.0 VRHE, i.e. is already at the boarder of practical relevance. This study sheds light on the rational design of Cu-based catalysts for directing the CO2RR reaction pathway.</description>

                Selectivity control of supported metal catalysts, which are most widely utilized in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, is of great scientific significance to obtaining the desired chemical product in a multipath reaction but has remained a grand challenging issue. In this work, we demonstrate that the selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation from CH4 to CO can be tuned by a robust and unique support doping strategy by changing the reduction activity of H species over M/Ce1&#8211;xPrxO2&#8722;&#948; (M = Ru, Rh) in which metal (M) nanoclusters showed the same existence form on differently doped ceria nanorod supports. The CH4 selectivity of the catalyst decreased with an increase in the Pr content in the support. The selectivity of CH4 on Ru/CeO2 was higher than 90%, while on Ru/Ce0.2Pr0.8O2&#8722;&#948;, the selectivity of CO reached 80%. A variety of techniques, including steady-state isotope transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA) type in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS)&#8211;mass spectrum (MS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR), had been applied in this work to analyze the structure&#8211;activity relationship between the doping of Pr and the selectivity of the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. Ru sites were not directly involved in the hydrogenation of carbon-containing intermediate species (including bicarbonate and formate) during the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. The active H species on the support sites, which are incorporated in RE3+&#8211;OH, directly contacted and reacted with the carbon-containing intermediate species. The introduction of Pr in the support weakened the reducing ability of the support, thus decreasing the reducing ability of H species on the surface of the catalyst, which further hindered the conversion of formate into CH4, resulting in the declined CH4 selectivity. Our study clearly revealed the important role of support in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction and proposed a strategy to modulate the reaction selectivity via support doping. By changing the redox performance of the support, the activity of H species on the support can be adjusted. Thus, the conversion of important reaction intermediates (such as formate) can be affected, so as to achieve precise regulation of the reaction products. We have provided a broader perspective for the selective catalyst design of heterogeneous catalysis and the reaction mechanism study of supported metal catalysts.</description>

                Carbon emission intensity is an important index reflecting an entity&#8217;s low-carbon competitiveness. This paper presents an extended logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) model to dissect carbon intensity within China&#8217;s civil aviation from 1998 to 2019, revealing a significant reduction in CO2 emissions per air transport revenue. It attributes this decrease to technological advancements, optimized fleet structures, and improved operational efficiencies, highlighting the impact of larger, more efficient aircraft and enhanced load factors. The study also explores economic factors influencing carbon efficiency, suggesting a comprehensive approach encompassing technological innovation and strategic operational improvements for sustainable aviation development.</description>

                Due to their availability, low cost, and activity, cobalt-based catalysts are a promising alternative to platinum for the industrial propane dehydrogenation processes. However, their low stability due to sintering, phase transformation, and coke deposition leads to severe deactivation. In this work, the synthesis of amorphous, ordered mesoporous alumina with stabilized Co2+ nanoclusters (Co-m-Al2O3) via an evaporation-induced self-assembly synthesis route is presented. The ordered mesoporous alumina is characterized for containing a large amount of defective pentacoordinate Al3+ sites and a small amount of strong acid sites. The incorporation of Co2+ clusters within the m-Al2O3 structure enhances the dispersion and stability and preserves their reduction even after prolonged time on stream. This leads to a highly selective and steady catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation reaction under industrial-relevant conditions. A significantly low deactivation rate of 0.53 d&#8211;1 with stable propylene selectivity of 95% is observed after 23 h, resulting in a 117% higher space&#8211;time yield toward propylene compared to the state-of-the-art impregnated Co/&#947;-Al2O3 catalyst. Furthermore, Co-m-Al2O3 leads to 4.6 times less coke formation, measured in situ for the first time. The detailed study of the nature of the cobalt sites, together with the acidic properties of the alumina supports, provides a deeper understanding of cobalt-based catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions.</description>

      <title>A Review of Coupled Geochemical&#8211;Geomechanical Impacts in Subsurface CO2, H2, and Air Storage Systems</title>

                Increased demand for decarbonization and renewable energy has led to increasing interest in engineered subsurface storage systems for large-scale carbon reduction and energy storage. In these applications, a working fluid (CO2, H2, air, etc.) is injected into a deep formation for permanent sequestration or seasonal energy storage. The heterogeneous nature of the porous formation and the fluid&#8211;rock interactions introduce complexity and uncertainty in the fate of the injected component and host formations in these applications. Interactions between the working gas, native brine, and formation mineralogy must be adequately assessed to evaluate the efficiency, risk, and viability of a particular storage site and operational regime. This study reviews the current state of knowledge about coupled geochemical&#8211;geomechanical impacts in geologic carbon sequestration (GCS), underground hydrogen storage (UHS), and compressed air energy storage (CAES) systems involving the injection of CO2, H2, and air. Specific review topics include (1) existing injection induced geochemical reactions in these systems; (2) the impact of these reactions on the porosity and permeability of host formation; (3) the impact of these reactions on the mechanical properties of host formation; and (4) the investigation of geochemical-geomechanical process in pilot scale GCS. This study helps to facilitate an understanding of the potential geochemical&#8211;geomechanical risks involved in different subsurface energy storage systems and highlights future research needs.</description>

                Increasing the product selectivity and decreasing the cost of product separation is critical for large scale application of electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECO2R). We hypothesize that highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes can tune the microenvironment of the catalyst/electrolyte interface and improve product selectivity. Compared to a conventional electrolyte concentration of 1 M HCOOK, the use of a 7.1 M HCOOK electrolyte increases the FE ratio of C2H4/CO from 2.2 &#177; 0.3 to 18.3 &#177; 4.8 at -1.08 V vs RHE on a Cu gas diffusion electrode. Based on electrochemical analysis and AIMD simulation, the identity and concentration of the cation and anion play more important roles in controlling the CO2R reaction pathway than the bulk CO2 solubility and the bulk pH of electrolytes. In-situ ATR-SEIRAS suggests that, unlike 1 M HCOOK, the *CO-bridge binding mode on Cu is dominant in 7.1 M HCOOK electrolyte, which potentially results in less CO release and higher yield of C2H4. This study demonstrates that while we can tailor the electrolyte composition to shift product selectivity, the factors that control the product selectivity are numerous and cannot be distilled down into one correlated property-reactivity relationship. Thus, when CO2R conditions are changed, care must be taken to understand their effects on the bulk electrolyte properties and the electrode-electrolyte interface.</description>

                One of the urgent problems today is the increased energy consumption in the industrial sector. This negatively affects the ultimate cost of the product and also leads to increased anthropogenic impact on the environment. Industrial-territorial clusters have extensive utility networks, which transfer heat between plants, so the development of methods to reduce their energy consumption will solve this problem. This paper presents a systematic approach to assessing the possibility of direct process integration of plants belonging to the same industrial-territorial cluster to maximize heat recovery. The determination of process flows used for direct process integration can be made based on the territorial location of plants and the availability of space for new heat exchange equipment and piping, and the maximum potential for heat recovery can be estimated using a composite curve graph. The study analyzes monomer production and assesses the potential for reducing energy consumption through direct process integration of pyrolysis and gas separation units, which amounted to 7.3 MW and can only be achieved with process integration. The total reduction in energy consumption with joint intraand direct process integration is 66.7 MW. This also leads to a reduction in CO2 emissions of 140,152 t/year.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Investigation of the Potential-Dependent CO Adsorption on Copper Electrodes</title>

                Despite the importance of CO adsorption in many electrocatalytic reaction mechanisms, there has been little investigation of the dependence of the free energy of CO adsorption on the applied potential. Herein, we report on the potential-dependent adsorption of CO on Cu electrodes using a grand-canonical density functional theory approach. We demonstrate that, within the working potential range of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on Cu(111) and Cu(100), the CO adsorption strength can change by over 0.1 eV. Our analyses explain the potential dependence through an interfacial capacitance loss upon CO adsorption as well as orbital relaxation induced by the electrode potential. Via sensitivity analysis with respect to two electrolyte model parameters (solvent dielectric constant and Debye screening length), we find that the surface excess charge density is a useful descriptor of the CO adsorption free energy.</description>

                This work explores technical challenges and potential methodologies for understanding electrochemical Reactive CO2 Capture (RCC) mechanisms. RCC offers potential energy cost advantages by directly converting captured CO into fuels and chemicals, unlike traditional carbon capture and utilization (CCU) processes that require sequential capture, concentration, and compression. However, direct conversion of captured CO introduces complexity due to additional equilibrium buffer reactions, making it challenging to identify active species for reduction in electrochemical studies. This work discusses methods to integrate transport, thermodynamics, and kinetics concepts to identify active carbon sources in RCC. Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) and transport models are validated against experimental results obtained in a gastight rotating cylinder electrode reactor and are shown as useful tools for studying RCC in heterogeneous electrocatalysts across different capture agents, solvents, and temperatures. This work establishes an experimental framework for advancing research in electrochemical RCC.</description>

      <title>The Selectivity Origins in Ag-Catalyzed CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electroreduction</title>

                Ag exhibits high selectivity of electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) toward C1 products, while the hydrogenation involving the concerted proton&#8211;electron transfer (CPET) or sequential electron&#8211;proton transfer (SEPT) mechanism is still in debate. Toward a better understanding of the Ag-catalyzed electrochemical CO2R, we employed a microkinetic model based on the Marcus electron transfer theory to thoroughly investigate the selectivity of C1 products of electrochemical CO2R over the Ag(111) surface. We found that at an acidic condition of pH = 1.94, formate is the main product when U &lt; &#8722;0.94 V via the CPET mechanism, whereas CO becomes the primary product when U &gt; &#8722;0.94 V via the SEPT mechanism. Conversely, at an alkaline condition of pH = 13.95, formate is the main product following the SEPT mechanism. Our findings provide novel insights into the influence of external factors (applied potential and pH) on the product selectivity and hydrogenation mechanism of electrochemical CO2R.</description>

                The unused garbage which is accumulating the landfills, such as raw materials, could be reused for synthetic gasoline production. This study presents the multiple&#8217;s effect technique, which is based on the reusage of different non, party and sorted municipal solid wastes (MSW), or biogas for syngas, converted into synthetic gasoline. The novelties of this technique include a basic multiple&#8217;s effect parameter (MUW), which present a level of waste sorting, an effect of oxygen inhibition into different wastes, a simplified mathematical model and simulation with an Aspen Plus&#174; simulator using the retrofitted methanol plan converted into the synthetic gasoline production. This technique includes a circular economy by using a circulated purified flue gas as raw material, co-products of hydrogen and water. This technique was tested on an existing methanol process, replacing natural gas with different alternatives of wastes or biogas for the synthetic gasoline production. The best alternative was the sorted MSW, which could generate an additional profit of 4.8 MEUR/a, including the garbage and CO2 emission reductions of 0.106&#903;106 t/a and of 0.084 &#903;106 t/a.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Predictive Control for Large-Scale Urban Road Networks</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2406.10433</link>
      <description>Renukanandan Tumu, Wenceslao Shaw Cortez, J&#225;n Drgo&#328;a, Draguna Vrabie, S. Glavaski, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399794197

                Transportation is a major contributor to CO2 emissions, making it essential to optimize traffic networks to reduce energy-related emissions. This paper presents a novel approach to traffic network control using Differentiable Predictive Control (DPC), a physics-informed machine learning methodology. We base our model on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) and the Networked Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (NMFD), offering a simplified representation of citywide traffic networks. Our approach ensures compliance with system constraints by construction. In empirical comparisons with existing state-of-the-art Model Predictive Control (MPC) methods, our approach demonstrates a 4 order of magnitude reduction in computation time and an up to 37% improvement in traffic performance. Furthermore, we assess the robustness of our controller to scenario shifts and find that it adapts well to changes in traffic patterns. This work proposes more efficient traffic control methods, particularly in large-scale urban networks, and aims to mitigate emissions and alleviate congestion in the future.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Capacity Optimization of an Integrated BFGCC&#8211;MSHS&#8211;Wind&#8211;Solar Energy System for the Decarbonization of a Steelmaking Plant</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17122994</link>
      <description>Chamin Geng, Zhongyuan Shi, Xianhao Chen, Zengqi Sun, Yawei Jin, Tian Shi, Xiao Wu, Energies. 17(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399778921

                Deploying renewable generation to replace conventional fossil-fuel-based energy supplies provides an important pathway for the decarbonization of steelmaking plants. Meanwhile, it is also crucial to improve the flexibility of blast-furnace-gas-fired combined-cycle power plants (BFGCCs) to ease the accommodation of uncertain renewable generation. To this end, this paper proposes the deployment of a molten salt heat storage (MSHS) system in BFGCCs to store the heat of gas turbine flue gas so that the power&#8211;heat coupling of these BFGCCs can be unlocked to enhance the flexibility of the energy supply. A stochastic capacity optimization of an integrated BFGCC&#8211;MSHS&#8211;wind&#8211;solar (BMWS) energy system is presented to determine the optimal installed capacities of a BFG holder, MSHS, wind turbine, and PV panel, aiming to achieve an economic and safe energy supply for the entire system. Multiple scenarios considering uncertain fluctuations in load demands and renewable generation are generated with the Monte Carlo method based on a typical scenario. These scenarios are then reduced to representative scenarios using the synchronous substitution and reduction method for stochastic capacity optimization to enhance the reliability of the results. The case study results demonstrate that configuring MSHS reduces the total annualized cost of the BMWS system by 2.28%. Furthermore, considering the uncertainties of the power/heating load and wind/PV generation can reduce the expected annualized total cost of the BMWS system and the corresponding standard deviation by 5.66% and 81.45%, respectively. The BMWS system can achieve 730.68 tons of equivalent CO2 reduction in 24 h due to the successful utilization of renewable energy. This paper provides an effective approach for the decarbonization of energy generation systems in steelmaking plants.</description>

      <title>Electronic Tunability of Ruthenium Formyl and Hydroxymethyl Intermediates Relevant to Sustainable CO-to-Methanol Conversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-qp40w</link>
      <description>Jared Z. Litman, Rida Farhat, Kaitlin Branch, Sasha Cryan, Kaeden Teindl, Brian O. Patrick, Eva M. Nichols, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399808244

                Metal formyl and hydroxymethyl complexes are implicated as key intermediates in the (photo)electrochemical reduction of carbon oxides (CO2 or CO) to liquid fuels such as methanol. Formyl complexes&#8212;and to a lesser extent hydroxymethyl complexes&#8212;have been previously synthesized and characterized; nevertheless, the influence of electronic modifications to ligands supporting these reactive carbon fragments is not well understood. Herein, we report the synthesis of a family of ruthenium polypyridyl carbonyl complexes of the form [Ru(4,4&#8217;-R,R-bpy)(tpy)(CO)] 2+ bearing different substituents on the bipyridyl (bpy) ligand (R = OMe, H, CF3). Treatment with NaBH4 as a chemical reductant results in formation of the formyl and subsequently the hydroxymethyl and methyl complexes; each are characterized by comprehensive NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and isotopic labeling studies. An electron-donating modification (R = OMe) to the bpy ligand is shown to significantly increase the lifetime of the formyl intermediate and the yield of released methanol. We observe a clear linear dependence of thermodynamic parameters on bpy electronics, however the stability of the formyl complex and the reactivity of the resulting hydroxymethyl complex do not depend linearly on ligand electronics. We anticipate that these results may be extended to future development of (photo)electrocatalytic systems for CO-to-methanol conversion.</description>

      <title>Chemical and Redox Non-Innocence in Low&#8208;Valent Molybdenum &#946;-Diketonate Complexes: Novel Pathways for CO2 and CS2 Activation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-8kkgv</link>
      <description>Fabio Masero, Victor Mougel, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399789297

                The investigation of fundamental properties of low-valent molybdenum complexes bearing anionic ligands is crucial for elucidating the molybdenum&#8217;s role in critical enzymatic systems involved in the transformation of small molecules, including the nitrogenase&#8217;s iron molybdenum cofactor, FeMoco. The &#946;-diketonate ligands in [Mo(acac)3] (acac = acetylacetonate), one of the earliest low-valent Mo complexes reported, provide a robust anionic platform to stabilize Mo in its +III oxidation state. This complex played a key role in demonstrating the potential of low-valent molybdenum for small molecule activation, serving as the starting material for the preparation of the first reported molybdenum dinitrogen complex. Surprisingly however, given this fact and the widespread use of &#946;-diketonate ligands in coordination chemistry, only a very limited number of low-valent Mo &#946;-diketonate complexes have been reported. To address this gap, we explored the redox behavior of homoleptic molybdenum tris-&#946;-diketonate complexes, employing a tertiary butyl substituted diketonate ligand (dipivaloylmethanate, tBudiket) to isolate and fully characterize the corresponding Mo complexes across three consecutive oxidation states (+IV, +III, +II). We observed marked reactivity of the most reduced congener with heterocumulenes CE2 (E = O, S), yet with very distinct outcomes. Specifically, CO2 stoichiometrically carboxylates one of the &#946;-diketonate ligands, while in the presence of excess CS2, catalytic reductive dimerization to tetrathiooxalate occurs. Through the isolation and characterization of reaction products and intermediates, we demonstrate that the observed reactivity results from the chemical non-innocence of the &#120573;-diketonate ligands, which facilitates the formation of a common ligand-bound intermediate, tBuMo(II)&#183;CE2 (E = O, S). The stability of this proposed intermediate dictates the specific reduction products observed, highlighting the relevance of the chemically non-innocent nature of &#120573;-diketonate ligands.</description>

      <title>Catalytic Peculiarity of Alkali Metal Cation-Free Electrode/Polyelectrolyte Interfaces Toward CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c04591</link>

                A prominent feature of modern electrochemical technologies, such as fuel cells and electrolysis, is the employing of polyelectrolytes instead of liquid electrolytes. Unlike the well-studied electrode/liquid electrolyte interfaces, however, the catalytic characteristics of electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces remain largely unexplored, mostly due to the lack of reliable probing methods. Herein, we report a universally applicable approach to investigating electrocatalytic reactions at electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces under normal electrochemical conditions. By coating a thin layer of anion-exchange membrane (AEM) onto the electrode surface, solutions with bulky organic cations were well separated, thus a pure electrode/polyelectrolyte interface can be established in a regular electrochemical setup and studied using in situ spectroscopies, e.g., attenuated total reflectance surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS). We found that the blank Au surface was inert toward the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) in the absence of alkali metal cations, whereas coating with an AEM can dramatically turn on the catalytic activity. ATR-SEIRAS revealed that the hydrogen bond network of water at the Au/AEM interface was enhanced in comparison to that on the blank Au surface, which facilitated the hydrogenation process of the CO2RR. These findings further our fundamental understanding of the catalytic behavior of electrode/polyelectrolyte interfaces and benefit the development of relevant electrochemical technologies.</description>

                To mitigate dangerous climate change, a drastic reduction of CO2 emissions is needed by 2030. Buildings contribute significantly to emissions, with the use phase of existing buildings being responsible for the majority of energy consumption. In addition, environmental problems associated with the production of raw materials, construction, and the end of life of buildings are serious concerns that require urgent solutions. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and the EU-recommended Environmental Footprint (EF) are widely accepted tools to measure environmental impacts throughout a product life cycle. However, assessing the environmental performance of wooden buildings remains a challenge. This study presents a benchmark for an average new European wooden building fulfilling the European nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB) requirement. The benchmark utilizes the recommended EU EF impact categories with normalization and weighting, allowing for easy and quick comparisons. The results communicate the average environmental impact per square meter of floor area over one year. This benchmark is a suitable comparison point for new wooden building designs and is used as an effective tool for architects and designers during the initial planning stages of wooden buildings. By using this benchmark, the environmental performance of the building can be improved, and the communication and interpretation of LCA results can be facilitated for customers and other relevant stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Reticular Imine&#8208;linked Coordination Polymers Based on Paddlewheel Diruthenium/Dirhodium Nodes: Synthesis and Metal&#8208;site Dependent Photocatalytic Reduction of CO2</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202400885</link>
      <description>Chisa Itoh, Masashi Kitada, Mio Kondo, Shigeyuki Masaoka, Haruka Yoshino, Wataru Kosaka, Yusuke Ootani, Junko Matsuda, Momoji Kubo, Toyohiko J. Konno, Hitoshi Miyasaka, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399819228

                The paddlewheel&#8208;type dimetal core ([M2]) is a ubiquitous motif in the nodes in coordination polymers (CPs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). However, their preparation has relied on ligand&#8208;substitution&#8208;labile metal ions owing to challenges associated with crystallization. Consequently, examples featuring ligand&#8208;substitution&#8208;inert metal ions, such as Ru or Rh, are scarce. This study presents the synthesis of novel reticular imine&#8208;linked CPs incorporating the paddlewheel&#8208;type diruthenium(II, II) ([Ru2II,II]; 1&#8208;Ru) or dirhodium(II, II) ([Rh2II,II]; 1&#8208;Rh) subunits. The synthetic approach involved a Schiff base dehydration condensation reaction between p&#8208;formylbenzoate&#8208;bridged [Ru2II,II] or [Rh2II,II] precursors (i.e., CHO&#8211;Ru and CHO&#8211;Rh, respectively) and 2,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;phenylenediamine in a 1:2 ratio. The catalytic activities of 1&#8208;Ru and 1&#8208;Rh for the photochemical reduction of CO2 in a heterogeneous system depended on the metal site. The 1&#8208;Rusystem exhibited exceptional selectivity, generating 3.0 &#180; 104 mmol g&#8208;1 of CO after 24 h of irradiation, whereas the 1&#8208;Rhsystem generated a lower amount of CO (3.2 &#180; 103 mmol g&#8208;1). The catalytic activity of 1&#8208;Ru ranked with that of all relevant catalytic systems. This study paves the way for the exploration of [Ru2II,II]&#8208; or [Rh2II,II]&#8208;based polymers with open metal site&#8208;dependent functional properties.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Overview of Recycled Glass as Mineral Admixture for Circular UHPC Solutions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16125077</link>

                This review article analyzes the influence of recycled glass (as sand and powder) beyond the durability, rheology and compressive strength of plain UHPC, even exploring flexural and direct tensile performance in fiber-reinforced UHPC. Interactions with other mineral admixtures like limestone powder, rice husk ash, fly ash, FC3R, metakaolin and slags, among others, are analyzed. Synergy with limestone powder improves rheology, reducing superplasticizer usage. Research highlights waste glass&#8211;UHPC mixtures with reduced silica fume and cement content by over 50% and nearly 30%, respectively, with compressive strengths exceeding 150 MPa, cutting costs and carbon footprints. Furthermore, with the proper fiber dosage, waste glass&#8211;UHPC reported values for strain and energy absorption capacity, albeit lower than those of traditional UHPC formulations with high cement, silica fume and quartz powder content, surpassing requirements for demanding applications such as seismic reinforcement of structures. Moreover, durability remains comparable to that of traditional UHPC. In addition, the reported life cycle analysis found that the utilization of glass powder in UHPC allows a greater reduction of embedded CO2 than other mineral additions in UHPC without jeopardizing its properties. In general, the review study presented herein underscores recycled glass&#8217;s potential in UHPC, offering economic and performance advantages in sustainable construction.</description>

      <title>Binary and Ternary Blended Portland Cements Containing Different Types of Rice Husk Ash</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17122923</link>
      <description>Luis Miguel Ordo&#241;ez, M.V. Borrachero, J. Monz&#243;, Lourdes Soriano, J. Pay&#225;, Materials. 17(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399670703

                Rice husk ash (RHA) is agricultural waste with high silica content that has exhibited proven technical feasibility as a pozzolanic material since the 1970s. Notwithstanding, its use in mortars and concrete is limited by the standards currently utilized in some countries where RHA production is high and the aforementioned pozzolanic material is not standardized. This is the case in Spain, one of the main rice producers in Europe. Nowadays, the high pressure placed on the Portland cement production sector to reduce its energy use and CO2 emissions has given rise to a keen interest in mineral admixtures for cement manufacturing. In this research, we intended to establish the contributions of different RHA types to the final blended Portland cement properties (&#8220;H&#8221; is used to identify RHA in standardized cements). The experimental results demonstrated that RHA with good pozzolanic properties (large specific surface and high amorphous silica content) had to be limited to 10% cement replacement because of the severe reduction in workability at higher replacement percentages. RHA with lower reactivity, such as crystalline RHA, or fly ash (FA) can be used to prepare binary and ternary blended cements with reactive RHA. It is possible to design the following cements: CEM II/A-H and CEM II/A-(H-V). It would also be possible to design cement (CEM II/B-(H-V) with replacement values of up to 30% and the same 28-day mechanical performance as observed for the Portland cement without mineral addition.</description>

                The wide metabolic diversity of microalgae, their fast growth rates, and cost-effective production make these organisms highly promising resources for a variety of biotechnological applications, addressing critical needs in industry, agriculture, and medicine. The utilization of microalgae in consortia with bacteria is proving to be valuable in different biotechnological fields, including treating various types of wastewaters, producing biofertilizers, and extracting various products from their biomass. Monoculture of the microalgae Chlamydomonas has been a prominent research model for many years, extensively utilized in studying photosynthesis, sulfur and phosphorus metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, respiration, and flagella synthesis, among others. Recent re-search has increasingly recognized the potential of Chlamydomonas-bacteria consortia as a bio-technological tool for various applications. Bioremediation of wastewater using Chlamydomonas, and its bacterial consortia presents significant potential for the sustainable reduction of contam-inants, while also facilitating resource recovery and valorization of microalgal biomass. Using Chlamydomonas and its bacterial consortia as biofertilizers can offers several benefits, such as en-hancing crop yield, protecting crops, maintaining soil fertility and stability, aiding in CO2 miti-gation, and contributing to sustainable agriculture practices. Chlamydomonas-bacterial consortia play a significant role in the production of high-value products, particularly in biofuel and en-hancing H2 production. This review aims to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the po-tential of Chlamydomonas monoculture and its bacterial consortia, identifying current applications, and proposing new research and development directions to maximize its potential.</description>

      <title>Assessing the levels of soil water availability that minimize the damage of heatwaves to potted grapevines</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26353/j.itahort/2024.1.95109</link>
      <description>Walaa Shtai, Dolores Asensio, Georg Wohlfahrt, Massimo Tagliavini, Italus hortus. 31(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399741115

                The adverse effects of heatwaves on viticulture could be, at least partly, mitigated by generous soil water availability. As climate change will also likely reduce irrigation water, knowing to which extent soil water availability could be decreased under the heatwaves without compromising plant performances would be important. In this pot experiment, we differentiated soil water availability by compensating 100% (T100), 70% (T70), 40% (T40) and 10% (T10) of vine transpiration. Grapevines (cv. Sauvignon) were then subjected to a 11-day heatwave (Tmax 40 &#176;C) and to a post-heat stress recovery phase. Soil water potential between -0.05 to -0.2 MPa, respectively, in T100 and T70 enabled the plants to maintain high net CO2 assimilation (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), and leaf transpiration (Eleaf) which kept the leaf temperature (Tleaf) below the ambient temperature and promoted the plant growth. During the heatwave, T100 and T70 vines decreased their photochemical yield and dissipated the excess energy via regulated non-photochemical heat dissipation, and resumed their photochemical activities upon removing the heat stress. Further reduction in soil water potential to -0.4 and and -1.2 MPa in T40 and T10, respectively, decreased Pn and gs and restrained Eleaf, causing a significant increase in Tleaf during the heatwave, and limited the plant recovery after the heat stress. Nonetheless, the maximum efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) showed quite high resistance to heat stress in all treatments. These findings suggest that decreasing soil water availability to reach soil water potential levels close to -0.2 MPa implies higher efficiency in using water resources during a heat wave without limiting plant growth.</description>

                As the third-largest maize-producing province in China and a typical arid and semi-arid region, quantitatively evaluating the carbon and nitrogen footprints of maize production and their dominant factors is of great significance in guiding the high-yield, low-carbon, and sustainable development of maize production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This study quantitatively evaluated the interannual evolution characteristics of the carbon and nitrogen footprints in maize production and their dominant factors in Inner Mongolia from 2003 to 2022 based on statistical yearbook data and emission parameter models. The results showed that from 2003 to 2022, the maize planting area, yield, and total yield in Inner Mongolia all increased, with an average annual increase of 97 kg ha&#8722;1 in yield and 1.23 &#215; 106 Mg in total yield. The carbon and nitrogen footprints of Inner Mongolia maize production over the past 20 years had overall decreasing trends, while the nitrogen fertilizer bias productivity, net ecosystem carbon balance, and sustainability index had increasing trends. Carbon footprint reduced by an average of 5.2 kg CO2 eq Mg&#8722;1 per year, and nitrogen footprint reduced by an average of 0.21 g N eq kg&#8722;1 per year. Currently, the transportation and production of fertilizer and field application of N fertilizer are the main controlling factors of GHG emissions from maize production. NO3&#8722;-N, NH4+-N leaching, and NH3 volatilization from field application of N fertilizer are the main sources of reactive N losses. The application of simplified processes, such as phased regulation of nitrogen and controlled-release fertilizers, as well as conservation tillage, have broad prospects for emission reduction in maize production in Inner Mongolia.</description>

      <title>1512-P: Brown Adipose NMNAT1 Is Necessary for Maintaining NAD+ Levels but Dispensable for Systemic Energy Metabolism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2337/db24-1512-p</link>
      <description>Xizhong Shen, Wook Song, Yang Cao, Xiuxiang Jiao, Youwen Zhu, Cholsoon Jang, Qin Yang, Diabetes. 73(Supplement_1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399692621

                Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is rich in mitochondria and expresses high levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), enabling it to regulate thermogenesis and system energy expenditure. NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is a key cofactor for maintaining mitochondrial function by serving as a redox carrier and signaling molecule. To investigate the regulation and function of NAD+ in BAT, we measured the expression of genes involved in NAD+ synthesis and catabolism in mice under room temperature, cold challenge, and thermoneutral conditions. We found that the expression of nicotinamide nucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT1), the final enzyme for NAD+ synthesis, was suppressed by thermoneutrality and increased by cold challenge in BAT. We, therefore, generated brown adipocyte-specific NMNAT1 knockout mice (NMNAT1-bKO) by crossing the NMNAT1 flox/flox mice to the UCP1-Cre mice. NMNAT1 deletion reduced NAD+ levels by approximately 50%, accompanied by the accumulated precursors, including NMN and NaMN in BAT. Despite the significant reduction of BAT NAD+, NMNAT1-bKO mice showed comparable body weight, normal glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and unchanged systemic energy metabolism, including O2 consumption, CO2 production, and RER in the metabolic cage studies. Further cold challenges and high-fat diet feeding did not induce any differences in the metabolic phenotype. RNA-seq analysis of BAT from NMNAT1-bKO and control mice under cold challenge revealed enrichment of genes involved in mitochondrial function and lipid metabolic process. These results show that BAT NMNAT1 is necessary for maintaining NAD+ levels but dispensable for systemic energy metabolism, possibly due to compensatory upregulation of mitochondrial genes.

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0304569</link>
      <description>&#201;der Rodrigues Ara&#250;jo, Ivan Daniel Bezerra Nogueira, Paulo Barbosa, Patr&#237;cia Ang&#233;lica de Miranda Silva Nogueira, PloS one. 19(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399770005

                Introduction The thoracic surgical procedure leads to a reduction in respiratory muscle strength. To restore it, certain strategies must be employed. Physiotherapy utilizes resources and techniques such as deep breathing stimulation, cough stimulation, use of incentive spirometers, mobilization, and ambulation. However, at times these resources and techniques may prove insufficient, and additional measures, such as Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV), are employed Pieczkoski (2017). Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation (NPPV) has been utilized to expedite pulmonary function recovery as well as to prevent and treat postoperative pulmonary complications Nasrala 2018. NIV diminishes the risk of ventilator-associated complications due to its non-invasive nature. Consequently, NIV has been adopted to avert post-extubation complications in postoperative patients Liu 2020. The objective of this study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial and assess the efficacy of NIV in comparison to conventional physiotherapy in terms of pulmonary function among patients undergoing cardiac surgery at a selected hospital in Campina Grande, Para&#237;ba, Brazil. Methods and analyses This randomized, controlled, double-blind (patient and analyst) clinical trial will be conducted at Hospital Jo&#227;o XXIII in Campina Grande, Para&#237;ba, Brazil. Patients do not know which group they are allocated to. Those in the group that use CPAP or BIPAP will not be able to distinguish one from the other. The data analyst at the end of the collections will also be blinded. Only the health professional who will be applying the protocol cannot be blinded. The sample size, determined via sample calculation, yielded a total of 21 patients per group (63 patients). The patients will be allocated into 3 groups (CPAP group - CPAP + standard physiotherapy, BiPAP group - BiPAP + standard physiotherapy, and Control group - standard physiotherapy) in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. The control group will receive the usual physiotherapeutic treatment as per the kinesiotherapy protocol. The treatment will be administered twice daily, starting in the ICU and progressing to the ward. In the CPAP group, nasal CPAP at 10cmH2O will be administered for 1 hour, twice daily, using an approved device. In the BiPAP group, nasal BiPAP with an IPAP of 13cmH2O and EPAP of 8cmH2O will be administered for 1 hour, twice daily, using an approved device. The NIV sessions will be conducted over the course of 5 days of hospitalization, both in the ICU and the ward. Assessments will be conducted at two time points: on day 1 preoperatively and on day 5 postoperatively. The following measures will be evaluated: pulmonary function, length of hospital stay, presence of postoperative pulmonary complications, score of the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) in its Portuguese version, functional capacity, the Global Perception of Change Scale, and the Functional Independence Measure (MIF). The normality of variables will be assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. IBM SPSS Statistics Base 25.0, using the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality and paired Student&#8217;s t-test for pre-post intervention comparison. They will use linear mixed effects models for longitudinal analysis and GLMMs to compare NIV effects over time between groups. They will employ ITT for missing data, INAR models for time dependence, fixed effects models for endogeneity, and Cohen&#8217;s d for effect sizes. Parametric model assumptions will be checked, and various models will be considered for data characteristics. Primary outcomes Pulmonary function, Length of hospital stay. Second outcomes Score of the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ) in Portuguese version, Funcional capacity, The global perception of change scale, The functional independence measure (MIF), pO2 (partial pressure of oxygen), pCO2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), HCO3 (bicarbonate), Arterial Oxygen Saturation (SaO2), Base Excess (BE), Presence of lung complications. Other pre-specified outcomes Duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, type of surgery, personal history, preoperative ejection fraction, previous respiratory complications, body mass index (BMI), gender and age.

                Food security and climate change pose great threats to the future of the agriculture industry. By 2050, with 20% arable land reduction and an additional 2.2 billion people, agriculture will need to adapt. Before this research, precision agriculture had shown significant advantages in improving resource usage efficiency and yields with less land. However, most of the popular precision agriculture approaches are associated with the tag of high technical barriers to implementation and scalability. This dissertation aims to answer the central question: What approaches should be applied for precision agriculture, through both hardware and software applications, to understand the scientific connection between plant physiological response and changing environmental conditions, ultimately enhancing agricultural production? Several published, submitted, and drafted studies prepared the foundation for this interdisciplinary research discussed in Chapters 2 - 5. Chapter 2 delves into a manufacturing pathway dedicated to customizing cost-effective and performance-effective sensors for precision agriculture. Through extensive experimentation involving temperature, speed, and applied voltage, we employ electric field-assisted direct writing technology to fabricate 3D metallic structures. This innovative approach empowers us to adapt sensor functional and dimensional variations to suit the specific requirements for collecting environmental and physiological data, as elaborated in Chapter 5. The ability to rapidly prototype these sensors enhances the efficiency of plant science research, contributing to the broader goals of precision agriculture. In Chapter 3, we focus on developing a germination substrate with precise control over mechanical gripping forces, water regulation, plant respiration, and real-time root growth visualization. We achieve distinct mechanical characteristics by leveraging the anisotropic properties of 3D-printed Carboxylated methylcellulose (C-MC), ensuring liquid-free water access, oxygen supply, and carbon dioxide removal. This transparent substrate enables 100%germination, non-destructive evaluation of germination and facilitates root phenotyping, offering flexibility in experimental conditions for plant science research. Furthermore, it validates the viability of seed germination in hydrogels, which explores environmental conditions for lettuce growth and leverages the anisotropic mechanical performance afforded by additive manufacturing. Building upon the foundation laid in Chapter 3, which showcased the potential of MC hydrogel, we conducted further experiments involving formulation chemistry modifications. Chapter 4 explores the most influential environmental parameters affecting plants during germination. Through three rounds of trials and two iterations of Hoagland formulation optimizations tested with more than 900 seeds, we identify pH, hydrogel content, and photo energy as the most influential factors impacting germination. This chapter validates the earlier findings regarding the impact of mechanical differentiation on germination, as established in Chapter 3. The insights gained in this study provide valuable recommendations for selecting environmental parameters in Chapter 5, enhancing the effectiveness of plant physiological research. In Chapter 5, we turn our attention to the operational aspects of our research, emphasizing the collection of efficient data, signal processing, and the translation of data into valuable evaluation indices. We integrate the sensing matrix into a customized hydroponic growing system capable of monitoring controlled environmental conditions while non-destructively evaluating lettuce's physiological responses. By processing and analyzing high-frequency weight measurement data, we create 14 plant phenotyping and system operation efficiency evaluation indices. These indices serve two vital purposes: firstly, they scientifically elucidate the connection between environmental condition shifts and the corresponding physiological responses of the plants; secondly, they enable us to evaluate system performance and provide actionable operational insights. This study employs a system engineering framework to design a hydroponic system that serves as a platform for plant physiology research. Its functions include the validation of results from Chapter 4, the establishment of scientific connections between quantifiable data and plant physiology, the proposal of a non-destructive and in-situ data acquisition system that significantly reduces sample requirements and resource usage, and, perhaps most importantly, the advancement of crop modeling and precision agriculture while minimizing technological barriers and costs.</description>

      <title>The Impact Measurement and Application of Conservation System (IMACS): A Review of a Framework for Impact Measurement, Application of Conservation and a Return to Sustainable Conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.31223/x5dd6j</link>
      <description>Vincent Dert, EarthArXiv (California Digital Library). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399701908

                The Impact Measurement and Application of Conservation System (IMACS) was recently described in ten preprint papers. IMACS represents the first &amp;ldquo;first principals&amp;rdquo; based system for measurement of damaging and conserving impacts and the calculation of sustainabilities for products, services and individuals. IMACS distinguishes &amp;ldquo;participating&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;non-participating&amp;rdquo; individuals, organizations and their products and services. IMACS automatically assigns damaging impacts to individuals, products and services. Under IMACS, each generator of impacts &amp;ldquo;owns&amp;rdquo; their impacts, while impacts are transferred with products sold or distributed. For the fully implemented and participating world, all impacts will be determined accurately using a combination of (mostly) remote sensing and (increasingly less) ground/sea level-based verification and straightforward calculations. For the initial application, all impacts will be estimated using a statistical approach, where products, services and individuals with higher impact uncertainty are assigned higher impacts. Participating organizations can select lower cost estimation methods leading to higher estimated impacts and vice versa. Under IMACS, each event creating additional impacts, represents an additional supply chain step. This makes it easy to follow each product throughout the supply chain until it&amp;rsquo;s purchase by the end-user consumer. Due to the level of automation used, the impact estimation/determination can be done at very low costs, much lower than using life cycle assessment (LCA) or input-output analysis methods. Resource using, damaging, protecting and restoring impacts are distributed over eleven impact groups. Conservation is made available by for-profit and non-profit organizations and distributed by IMACS licensed organizations as &amp;ldquo;Title-to-Conservation&amp;rdquo; (TTC). Neutralizing amounts of conservation are applied to participating products and services purchased by participating consumers. Due to the shortage of conservation as TTC, initially none to very little TTC can be applied, leading to initially very low retailer or supply chain costs expressed as percentage of sales. However, the sale of TTC at market prices will allow the exponential growth of the conservation industry and create strong incentives for reduction of resource using and elimination of damaging impacts throughout the supply chain. Increasing consumer demand for products &amp;ldquo;free of impacts&amp;rdquo; (after impact neutralization through application of TTC) will force supply chain participation, creating a &amp;ldquo;new normal&amp;rdquo; where the supply chain pays for the costs of conservation. Using this approach and a twenty-year transition period to full societal participation, return to pre-industrial atmospheric conditions can be achieved in 40 &amp;ndash; 60 years, greatly limiting damage from climate change, while saving costs. The same applies to all impact groups, greatly limiting environmental damage, biodiversity loss and reducing human suffering and premature deaths. A review of marketing studies indicates that the model assumptions used for societal participation are conservative. The use of certified and licensed for profit businesses for most tasks within IMACS allows a rapid global roll-out and scale-up of IMACS functionality. The system has the potential to create very large amounts of funding for conservation, and potentially allows a relative fast return to pre-industrial environmental conditions, while improving human conditions and saving costs. By participating in IMACS, individuals and organizations can eliminate current CO2 emissions, neutralize historic CO2 emissions, provide adequate fresh water for ecosystems, protect wildlife areas and their biodiversity, save money and improve their competitive position. IMACS, by assigning the costs of conservation (protection and restoration) to individuals and organizations responsible for the damage done, can effectively address and solve the classic &amp;ldquo;tragedy of the commons&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Tuning the intermolecular interactions of pentablock copolymers: Morphology, physical properties, gas separation, and ion conduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.31274/td-20240617-147</link>
      <description>Thivani Senathiraja, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399730201

                Tuning the interactions of solid multi-block polymer electrolytes is a cost-effective approach to target and advance specific properties for sustainable ion-conducting applications such as fuel cells, polymer actuators, gas separation, vanadium flow batteries, water desalination using electrodialysis, and water electrolysis to produce H2 and O2. The accelerated research interest in tailoring the properties of multi-block ionomers is fueled by their ability to assemble into various heterogeneous nanoscale structures. These structures' spatial arrangement and connectivity define film strength, durability, and molecule transport. Systematically designing the spatial arrangement is a key to understanding the structure and property relationships of proton-exchange membranes (PEM)/ionomers. Such a design may solve global challenges and contribute to renewable technologies like water and energy. In this dissertation, the morphological transitions of a multi-block ionomer known as a pentablock copolymer (PBC) are investigated to advance the basic science related to the design of functional materials and the development of morphology-composition-property-transport relationships related to random and multi-block ionomers. The intermolecular interactions of PBC were altered by manipulating their free energy, thermodynamics and equilibrium via polymer blending, systematic incorporation of metal salt, thermal annealing and impregnation of inorganic SiO2/TiO2 sols. A synergistic polymer blend consisting of PBC with ion-exchange capacities (IECs) of 1.0 and 2.0, and poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PPO) revealed that PBC(2.0) exhibited greater clustering of ion groups and phase separation compared to PBC(2.0)/PPO blends, as evidenced by an increase in domain spacing from 33.1 nm to 37.0 nm. Notably, the PBC(2.0)/PPO (90/10) blend membrane showed potential in hydrogen fuel cells as they exhibited comparable proton conductivity (110ms/cm) to Nafion even when the water uptake (WU) was reduced by 58 wt%. Moreover, the PBC(1.0)/PPO blend demonstrated an H2 permeability ranging from 36.7 to 43.3 Barrers and an O2 permeability of 6.84 to 7.10 Barrers, with an ideal H2/O2 selectivity of 5.81 to 6.60, representing a hydrogen fuel cell crossover improvement over unmodified PBC(1.0). Tailoring the structure and function of PBC(1.5) with monovalent lithium and trivalent aluminum cations via both in situ and ex situ methods demonstrated that film properties were impacted by their Lewis acid strength, cation size, and interaction energy between the metal ion and sulfonated group. The Li+ formed the most stable pair with sulfonic acid groups in PBC(1.5) due to their comparable Lewis acid strength (LAS) with a Lewis base strength of 0.25 to 0.29. Lower interaction energies of 22.7 to 45.5 J/mol were exhibited by Al3+ as compared to Li+, indicating incomplete neutralization with sulfonic acid groups. At a metal salt concentration of 0.01 M, PBC(1.5)-Li-[0.01] and PBC(1.5)-Al[0.01] exhibited either 43.4% higher conductivity or similar conductivity to PBC(1.5)-H+ at all hydration levels (10% RH, 50% RH, 90% RH, and 100% wet). The results showed that metal cations incorporated via the in situ method in the PBC matrix allowed systematic tunability of these membranes for CO2/CH4 separations, elevating CO2 selectivity by 303%. Additionally, the PBC membranes with IEC 1.0 and 2.0 were blended to investigate the interplay between the simultaneous increase in the polymer backbone and sulfonic acid groups. Proton conductivity results demonstrated higher conductivity (164-224 mS/cm) in blend membranes compared to Nafion, even at 90% relative humidity (RH), with PBC(1.0)/PBC(2.0) (20/80) and (10/90) blends exhibiting superior performance. Under wet saturated conditions, PBC(1.5) showed excellent proton conductivity at 52% lower water uptake (WU) compared to PBC(2.0). Gas transport studies indicated higher selectivity for &#945;H2/O2 (10.2-13.2) and &#945;CO2/CH4 (4.32-36.2) in blend membranes with IECs between 1.6-1.7 mmol/g, making them potential candidates for preventing hydrogen fuel cell crossover and applications in natural gas separation. Further, the effects of manipulating the distribution of SiO2/TiO2 inorganic sols within a PBC(1.0) matrix through thermal annealing and incorporation in different physical states (solid/liquid) showed that the degree of crystallinity varied from 1.10-10.34%, with increased crystallinity correlating with decreased water uptake (WU%). Surface energy analysis revealed the enhancement of proton conductivity through the rearrangement of sulfonate domains at the surface of PBC(1.0) membranes, facilitating a more efficient path for ion conduction and varied from 17.8-30.5 mJ/m2. Notably, PBC(1.0) exchanged with liquid TiO2 sols outperformed control and benchmark Nafion membranes, exhibiting superior proton conductivity and dimensional stability, achieving 138 mS/cm conductivity even with a 12.6% reduction in WU and a 61% increase in crystallinity. Overall, this dissertation delves into the crucial role of optimizing the intermolecular interactions of PBC in achieving targeted properties. The findings hold tremendous promise for the development of sustainable ion-conducting applications, such as hydrogen fuel cells, as they enable high proton conductivity without sacrificing dimensional stability. Furthermore, these PBC membranes exhibited the potential to enhance membrane-based H2/O2 and CO2/CH4, gas separations.</description>

      <title>An easy-to-use anesthetic strategy for mitigating postoperative complications following laparoscopic colorectal surgery</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1097/cm9.0000000000003163</link>
      <description>Huixian Li, Yuan Li, Yulin Sun, Dazhuang Ge, Zhaoxu Zheng, Wei Tang, Hui Zheng, Tao Yan, Chinese medical journal/Chinese Medical Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399716444

                To the Editor: The abdominal surgical procedures are linked to a high incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) and may be mitigated by administration of lung-protective mechanical ventilation during anesthesia.[1,2] To date, no relevant studies have focused on protective lung ventilation strategies specifically for laparoscopic colorectal cancer (CRC). Herein, we propose an innovative easy-to-use lung-protective strategy with lower tidal volume (VT), pneumoperitoneum pressure (PnP) and deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) and assess whether it is superior to conventional lung protection strategies in reducing PPCs. A single-center, randomized trial was conducted in patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery and followed up until 30 postoperative days (PODs). A total of 120 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 to either the test group (protective lung ventilation with lower VT (6 mL/kg of predicted body weight [PBW] + low PnP [10 mmHg] + deep NMB) or the control group (conventional pulmonary ventilation [8 mL/kg of PBW for VT] + standard PnP [15 mmHg] + moderate NMB). The institutional Ethics Committee approved the study protocol (Approval No. NCC2018W-006) and the registry was completed at ClinicalTrials.gov (ChiCTR1900021989). The written informed consent were signed by each patient before enrollment. The patient follow-ups were performed throughout the hospital stay once daily or by telephone and outpatient records when patients were discharged at Day 30 after operation [Supplementary Figure 1, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26]. In all the groups, mechanical ventilation during anesthesia consisted of volume-controlled modes of VT according to the group and PBW,[1,2] positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cm H2O, and alveolar recruitment maneuvers (ARMs) at 30-minute intervals. The respiratory rate was adjusted as necessary to maintain an end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) between 35 mmHg and 45 mmHg, with an inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio (I:E) of 1:2. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was maintained at 40&#8211;60% throughout the anesthesia treatment. A portable neuromuscular monitor was applied to the ulnar nerve to confirm the depth of the NMB. The indications of NMB depth were defined as train-of-four count (TOFC) = 0 and posttetanic count (PTC) &#8805;1 for deep NMB and TOFC = 1&#8211;3 for moderate NMB.[3] The primary endpoint of the PPCs was systematically assessed via the operational definition of Kroenke et al[4] with the grades ranging from 1 to 4 [Supplementary Table 1, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26]. For those suspected to have PPCs, low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) was routinely performed for confirmation. The secondary endpoints comprise postoperative analgesia and serological inflammatory factor expression. All the statistical analyses were performed by using SPSS 25.0 (IBM SPSS, Inc., NY, USA). The Kaplan&#8211;Meier (K&#8211;M) method combined with log-rank analysis was used to compare the incidence of PPCs between the two groups. Quantitative data are presented as the medians (interquartile ranges) and were compared using Student's t-test or the Mann&#8211;Whitney rank test. Categorical variables were analyzed using the chi-square or the Fisher exact test. The two-tailed P values &lt;0.05 were considered as statistically significant. The sample size was calculated according to the results of our preliminary experiment. With a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%, a minimum of 55 patients were included in each group. Considering a 10% drop-out rate during the follow-up, 60 patients were enrolled in each group. In this study, 152 patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal surgery were initially included, and a total of 120 patients were ultimately enrolled. The patients in the two groups had comparable baseline characteristics [Supplementary Table 2, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26]. The K&#8211;M analysis revealed a significant difference in the incidence of PPCs within 30 days after surgery between the test group (9 of 60, 15.0%) and the control group (19 of 60, 31.7%) (P = 0.031; Table 1, Supplementary Figure 2, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26). Of these, patients of grade 1 (primarily microatelectasis) account for the largest proportion of PPCs (test group vs. control group; 77.8% [7 of 9] vs. 68.4% [13 of 19]). For subgroup analysis, the test group exhibited superior analgesic outcomes and fewer related postoperative inflammatory responses than did the control group for individuals with a standard or overweight body mass index (BMI) &lt;27.9 kg/m2, who were younger than 62 years, or who had an anesthesia duration of 3 hours or less [Supplementary Figure 3, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26]. Atelectasis formation, a shift in the ventilation-to-perfusion ratio by reduced pulmonary compliance and increased chest pressure facilitates PPCs even in patients with healthy lungs. This pathophysiological alteration will be exacerbated during laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Pulmonary atelectasis is the main cause of PPCs progression and is mainly attributed to compression of the lung parenchyma, absorption of alveolar gases, and impaired extra-alveolar function. The use of higher FiO2 (&gt;80%) can also lead to absorptive lung atelectasis and exacerbate inflammatory lung injury.[2] PPCs can also cause lung injury, lung infection, or barotrauma in turn. Tidal volumes in the range of 6&#8211;8 mL/kg of PBW are widely accepted for non-injured lungs.[2] Single low-tidal volume ventilation plays the most important role in protective ventilation,[1,2,5] which may lead to decreased compliance and atelectasis formation. Therefore, in comparison to the control group, which had a concentration of 8 mL/kg, 6 mL/kg was adopted for the test group. The ideal level of PEEP to resist atelectasis remains in dispute, with low-risk patients receiving PEEP of less than 5 cm H2O but high-risk patients requiring higher levels of PEEP.[5] Once atelectasis has occurred, ARMs are required to recruit alveoli. Additionally, it has been proven that a lower PnP involves reduced peak inspiratory pressure and facilitates respiratory compliance, especially in the Trendelenburg position. Some evidence has shown that postoperative lung function is equivalent in patients receiving the same PnP, regardless of whether deep or moderate NMB is used, thus demonstrating a close correlation between PnP and postoperative PPCs.[6] Postoperative pain is another critical factor in the formation of PPCs, pain-induced restriction of abdominal breathing initiates the microatelectasis and subsequent atelectasis formation. Despite using the same standardized analgesic protocol in both groups, our results indicate that the lung-protective strategy was associated with lower short-term postoperative VAS scores (P = 0.016 for postoperative 1 h, P = 0.071 for POD 1 [Table 1]) and decreased serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression on POD 3 (P = 0.017). Of note, the subgroup results reveal a superior advantage in analgesia and systemic inflammation suppression in the test group, especially in those with BMI &lt;27.9 kg/m2, age &lt;62 years, or anesthesia duration &#8804;3 hours [Supplementary Figure 3, https://links.lww.com/CM9/C26]. One potential mechanism through which analgesia is achieved could be the reduction in tension exerted on the abdominal wall facilitated by deep NMB, thereby reducing postoperative incisional pain.[7] Additionally, low PnP can relieve visceral and shoulder pain by lowering the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood and reducing inflammatory cytokines/oxygen-free radicals arising from visceral ischemia&#8211;reperfusion injury. Given that inflammation is implicated in the progression of pain, lung injury, and PPCs,[1] the causal relationship remains undetermined.

IL-1&#946;: Interleukin-1&#946;; IL-6: Interleukin-6; POD: Postoperative day; PPCs: Postoperative pulmonary complications; VAS: Visual analog scale. As a single-center study, only one study site cannot be representative of the clinical practices in a larger patient population. Chronic postsurgical pain and more detailed pain categories should be further explored. Furthermore, mechanistic studies in the outcome after novel treatment strategies need to be investigated. In conclusion, the holistic anesthetic strategy of protective lung ventilation combined with deep NMB and low PnP can reduce the PPCs in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Further studies are needed to test the efficacy and heterogeneity of the clinical application of this easy-to-use anesthetic strategy.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan&amp;rsquo;s green building assessment system (EEWH) has a history of 20 years, but the number of green building label cases in residential buildings still accounts for less than 1% of the total number of Building Use permit, and the total floor area of the label cases are less than 20% of the total building which get Building Use permit. So there is still room for promoting the achievements of green buildings. Analyze the reasons for the low green building application rate, including the public&#8217;s view that the cost of green building is relatively high, the overall construction project period of the green building label is longer, and the amount of review information required is more than general building... Furthermore, the score for applying for a green building seal is often less than the score for applying for a candidate green building certificate. There are even cases where the green building seal is not applied. Project management refers to the proper management of various work items in the project life cycle to reduce the gap between project results and expected goals. In the past cases and related research in the construction industry, it was pointed out that project management has actual performance in controlling construction costs and duration. However, most of the cases are large-scale projects and factory buildings, and there is relatively little discussion on residential buildings. Therefore, in this study, an expert questionnaire will be used to discuss the ability of the construction project management to control the green building index project, in order to put forward the construction technology that can be considered first when designing residential-type green buildings under the project management thinking, so as to eliminate the public&#8217;s cost and schedule for green buildings Concerns. The research results show that the adoption of different green building technologies and facilities and equipment has indeed different management and control capabilities for construction projects. The indicators under the EEWH-RS version are more able to be controlled by the project management based on the daily energy saving indicators and the CO2 reduction indicators. However, the greenery indicators, water resource indicators and sewage and garbage improvement indicators, etc., because their technology has matured, become standard equipment or has been standardized, the project management cannot have a high influence on it. The research results can assist architects in the planning and design of residential-type green buildings, and draw up plans that are easier to control costs and schedules, thereby enhancing the owners&#8217; willingness to adopt green building technologies and facilities.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
