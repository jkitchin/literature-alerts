                The applicability of some industrial catalysts for the process of carbon dioxide conversion into synthesis gas has been evaluated process of carbon dioxide conversion into synthesis gas. For the study were chosen catalysts on the basis of transition metals (Fe, Ni, Co) and Cu, used in large-tonnage hydrogenation processes and synthesis-gas technology: NIAP-03-01 (catalyst for steam conversion of hydrocarbon gases), NIAP-06-06 (catalyst for low-temperature conversion of CO), AmoMax 10 (catalyst for ammonia synthesis), Co-Al 2 O 3 /SiO2 (catalyst for synthesis of hydrocarbons by Fischer&#8211;Tropsch method). The catalysts were tested in the process of catalytic reduction of CO 2 by reaction reverse gaswater shift (RGWS). It was shown that Cu-containing catalyst (NIAP 06-06) possesses the highest activity and selectivity in the process of catalytic reduction of CO 2 . Under conditions of GHSV = 32000 h &#8211;1 , H 2 /CO 2 = 2, and temperatures of 500&#8211;800 &#176;C, the equilibrium of the RGWS reaction is achieved by 97 %. Due to selection of technological parameters of CO 2 reduction (temperature, H 2 /CO 2 ratio) it is possible to obtain synthesis gas of the required composition. Due to selection of technological parameters of CO 2 reduction (temperature, H 2 /CO 2 ratio) it is possible to obtain synthesis gas of the required composition for the synthesis of hydrocarbons and methanol.</description>

      <title>Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Urea from Carbon Dioxide and Nitrate over a Cu2O Photocathode</title>

                Transformation of carbon dioxide and nitrate ions into urea offers an attractive route for both nitrogen fertilizer production and environmental remediation. However, achieving this transformation under mild conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient photoelectrochemical method for urea synthesis by co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrate ion over a Cu2O photocathode, delivering urea formation rate of 29.71&#177;2.20 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 12.90&#177;1.15 % at low external potential (&#8722;0.017 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). Experimental data combined with theoretical calculations suggest that the adsorbed CO* and NO2* species are the key intermediates, and associated C&#8722;N coupling is the rate&#8208;determining step. This work demonstrates that Cu2O is an efficient catalyst to drive co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; to urea under light irradiation with low external potential, showing great opportunity of photoelectrocatalysis as a sustainable tool for value&#8208;added chemical synthesis.</description>

                Carbon dioxide (CO2) electroreduction provides a sustainable route for realizing carbon neutrality and energy supply. Up to now, challenges remain in employing abundant and inexpensive nickel materials as candidates for CO2 reduction due to their low activity and favorable hydrogen evolution. Here, the representative iron-modified nickel nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (Ni1-Fe0.125-NC) with the porous botryoid morphology were successfully developed. Hexamethylenetetramine is used as nitrogen-doped carbon source. The collaboration of internal lattice expansion with electron effect and external confinement effect with size effect endows the significant enhancement in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The optimized Ni1-Fe0.125-NC exhibits broad potential ranges for continuous carbon monoxide (CO) production. A superb CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 85.0 % realized at &#8722;1.1 V maintains a longtime durability over 35 h, which exceeds many state-of-the-art metal catalysts. Theoretical calculations further confirm that electron redistribution promotes the desorption of CO in the process for favorable CO production. This work opens a new avenue to design efficient nickel-based materials by considering the intrinsic structure and external confinement for CO2 reduction.</description>

                Plasma conversion technology is an emerging technique under development to activate, convert or valorize gas molecules such as CO2, N2, CH4, NH3 and others. A large-scale application beyond the lab-scale demonstrator unit requires assessment of the efficiency of this new technology. The straightforward approach for assessment of the efficiency is benchmarking with the other well-established technologies of similar technology readiness level (TRL). In this paper we present a benchmarking of the atmospheric pressure microwave-induced CO2 plasma splitting with electrochemical CO2 conversion, via both low-temperature and high-temperature electrolysis. An additional step of oxygen removal in case of the plasma reactor is implemented due to the difference in the output stream of the plasma (gas mixture containing CO2, CO, and O2) and the electrochemical reactor (typical gas mixture on cathode containing CO2 and CO). For the benchmarking, a comprehensive set of comparison parameters that are applicable for both the plasma and the electrochemical route is identified and grouped in three comparison categories: performance, interfaces, and economics. The comparison of these parameters demonstrates that in terms of the electric power consumption (EPC; power required for production of one Nm3CO) plasma conversion technology (&#8764;20 kWh/Nm3CO) is in the ballpark with the other two electrochemical technologies (&#8764;4&#8211;20 kWh/Nm3CO). The key features of the plasma conversion technology are relatively large conversion (up to 56%) and moderate energy efficiencies (up to 27%). Also, CO2 gas of reduced purity of only 98% can be used without decrease of the performance, and CO output values are currently at 3.5 slm (standard litre per minute). Fast on/off response time of order of minutes, and no need for the hot standby indicate that the plasma conversion is particularly suitable for use of intermittent renewable energy sources. The aspects that require further development include optimization of the process towards lower EPCtotal values, improved oxygen gas separation, and reliable ignition of the plasma.</description>

      <title>Promoting the electrocatalytic activity for Ni-based single atom catalysts by nitrogen and phosphorus codopant towards CO2 reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcata.2024.119824</link>

                Electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) is a promising approach to accomplish the CO2 net emission. Ni-based single-atom catalysts (Ni-SACs) with the Ni-N-C structure have been the hotspot in this field. However, its catalytic activity is still unsatisfied. Regulation of the coordination environment of the active site via heteroatom doping is an efficient strategy to improve its catalytic characteristics and activity. Herein, the heteroatom phosphorus is introduced into the N-doped carbon supporter to form Ni-SA/CN-P catalyst achieving the CO Faraday efficiency of 91.8% at a potential of -1.1 V along with the CO current density 91.2 mA cm-2 in the flow cell, which is superior to the sample Ni-SA/CN without P dopant. It is attributed that the more defects are built in the Ni-SA/CN-P catalyst due to the different atomic radiuses of P and N atoms. Moreover, the gap between d-band center and Femi energy level is narrowed due to the doped P atoms, which reduces the rate-limiting barrier height leading to the promoted catalytic performance. The cooperation of various items finally results in the overall performance. This work provides a simple method for establishing single-atom catalysts with P doping to improve catalytic performance for CO2RR.</description>

                The photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction is severely limited by sluggish charge kinetics. To address this issue, a strategy utilizing non-metal-doped layered double hydroxide (LDH) has been developed to control the electronic structure of spindle-shaped nanoflowers, resulting in efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The results demonstrate that the designed catalyst yields 263.16 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 for the photoreduction of CO2 to CO. Furthermore, the in situ FT-IR analysis demonstrate that the specific S-ligand (S-bridge) facilitates CO2 activation, ensuring the continuous production of *COOH. The hydrothermal-assisted ionic liquid method proposed in this study offers guidance for modifying catalysts.</description>

                The practical application of the electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to form formic acid fuel is hindered by the limited activation of CO2 molecules and the lack of universal feasibility across different pH levels. Herein, we report a doping&#8208;engineered bismuth sulfide pre&#8208;catalyst (BiS&#8208;1) that S is partially retained after electrochemical reconstruction into metallic Bi for CO2RR to formate/formic acid with ultrahigh performance across a wide pH range. The best BiS&#8208;1 maintains a Faraday efficiency (FE) of ~95% at 2000 mA cm&#8208;2 in a flow cell under neutral and alkaline solutions. Furthermore, the BiS&#8208;1 catalyst shows unprecedentedly high FE (~95%) with current densities from 100 to 1300 mA cm&#8208;2 under acidic solutions. Notably, the current density can reach 700 mA cm&#8208;2 while maintaining a FE of above 90% in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer and operate stably for 150 h at 200 mA cm&#8208;2. In&#8208;situspectra and density functional theory calculations reveals that the S doping modulates the electronic structure of Bi and effectively promotes the formation of the HCOO* intermediate for formate/formic acid generation. This work develops the efficient and stable electrocatalysts for sustainable formate/formic acid production.</description>

                We have explored the photophysical properties and one electron reduction process in the dyad photocatalyst for CO2 photoreduction, ZnP-phen=Re, in which the catalyst of fac-[Re(1,10-phenanthoroline)(CO)3Br] (phen=Re) is directly connected with the photosensitizer of zinc (II) porphyrin (ZnP), using time-resolved infrared spectroscopy, transient absorption spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations. We revealed the photophysical properties that (1) the intersystem crossing occurs with a time constant of ~20 ps, which is more than 50 times faster than that of zinc (II) porphyrin, and (2) the charge density in the excited singlet and triplet states is mainly localized on ZnP, which means the excited state is assignable to the &#960; -&#960;* transition in ZnP. The one electron reduction using the reductant, 1,3-dimethyl-2-,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (BIH), occurs via the triplet excited state with time constant of ~170 ns and directly from the ground state by the deprotonated BIH with the time constant of ~3 &#956;s. The charge in the one electron reduction species spans ZnP and the phenanthroline ligand and the dihedral angle between ZnP and the phenanthroline ligand is rotated by ~24&#176; with respect to that in the ground state, which presumably offers an advantage for proceeding to the next CO2 reduction reaction step. These findings on the initial processes of CO2 photoreduction would help us to design novel dyad photocatalysts using porphyrin photosensitizers.</description>

                The extensive use of single-atom catalysts (SACs) has appeared as a significant area of investigation in contemporary study. The single-atom catalyst, characterized by its maximum atomic proficiency and great discernment of the transition-metal center, has a unique combination of benefits from both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts. Consequently, it effectively bridges the gap between these two types of catalysts, leveraging their distinctive features. The utilization of SACs immobilized on graphene substrates has garnered considerable interest, primarily because of their capacity to facilitate selective and efficient photocatalytic processes. This review aims to comprehensively summarize the progress and potential uses of SACs made from graphene in photocatalytic carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction and hydrogen (H2) generation. The focus is on their contribution to converting solar energy into chemical energy. The present study represents the various preparation methods and characterization approaches of graphene-based single-atom photocatalyst This review investigates the detailed mechanisms underlying these photocatalytic processes and discusses recent studies that have demonstrated remarkable H2 production rates through various graphene-based single-atom photocatalysts. Additionally, the pivotal roleof theoretical simulations, likedensity functional theory (DFT), to understand the structural functional relationships of these SACs are discussed. The potential of graphene-based SACs to revolutionize solar-to-chemical energy conversion through photocatalytic CO2 reduction and H2 production is underscored, along with addressing challenges and outlining future directions for this developing area of study. By shedding light on the progress and potential of these catalysts, this review contributes to the collective pursuit of sustainable and efficient energy conversion strategies to mitigate the global climate crisis.</description>

      <title>The comparative performance study of the EF7 downsized engines; fuel economy besides CO2 reduction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.55670/fpll.futech.3.3.4</link>

                Engine downsizing is considered a strategic idea in fuel economy enhancement as well as reduction. It is defined in the literature as the decrease in engine geometrical dimensions besides its performance being fixed. In this research, the Iranian gasoline-fueled national engine, EF7, has been investigated for 25% downsizing. After introducing the gasoline-fueled and CNG-fueled versions of downsized engines, their performance, besides release rates are studied in detail. A one-dimensional engine simulator coupled with a 3D-CFD model is developed to carry out such an investigation, an experimental test setup is provided to evaluate the accuracy of the provided numerical model, as well. The first version of presented downsized engines, called EF7, is a 3-cylinder engine with the same geometrical characteristics as the base engine, which is equipped with a turbo-charger and dual CVVT technologies. The EF7 is then introduced by fuel shifting to CNG as the second version of downsized engines, and finally, increasing the compression ratio, the EF7 is presented as the third version of studied-downsized engines. The results show almost the same rate of BSFC besides a 3.4% reduction in concentration for EF7, 20.6% fuel economy enhancement, besides 20.8% reduction in the specific release rate for EF7, and 28.8% fuel economy enhancement, besides 25.3% reduction in the specific release rate for EF7 in comparison with the base engine.</description>

                Summary CO2 storage capacity is limited in the Netherlands and high demand from emitters makes it essential to determine a practical capacity. Especially if neighbouring countries with even lower storage capacity such as Belgium and Germany will export significant CO2 volumes to fulfil their industrial abatement requirements. Previous work calculated a theoretical capacity for depleted gas fields from a simple gas replacement-pressure relationship. Practical capacity was then derived from a generic discount factor. Aquifer storage potential in the Netherlands was assumed limited but is currently being revaluated. This study shows a significant improvement by analysing the interaction of intrinsic geological properties and potential regulatory choices. Regulatory requirements to mitigate leakage risk by defining strict pressure limits for depleted gas field stores are not yet defined, but could have a strong effect. Hydrostatically limiting the bottom hole pressure is shown to severely reduce the capacity, especially on poorer quality fields and is largely related to pressure build-up around injection wells in these fields. Combined with additional economic limitations, more than 40% of the gas-replaced capacity is lost from the overall portfolio. Given the large effect, the necessity of these risk mitigation measures needs to be further assessed.</description>

                Using photoelectrochemical technology to construct efficient photoelectric materials has aroused extensive research interest. In this study, we propose a two-dimensional porous CuSe@BiOI isotype heterojunction photocathode for CO2 reduction to formic acid. The heterojunction was constructed by the epitaxial growth of high-quality oriented BiOI nanosheets onto the porous CuSe framework. The CuSe framework as a template to ensure the formation of the (1 0 2) facets of BiOI and the isotropic charge transport characteristics of the (1 0 2) surface greatly improve the efficiency of charge separation and transfer. This CuSe@BiOI isotype heterojunction electrode can efficiently reduce CO2 to formic acid with a selectivity of up to 80.5 % in 0.5 M potassium bicarbonate aqueous solution. Meanwhile, the performance of the photodetector based on CuSe@BiOI heterostructure is 6.97 &#215; 1011 Jones and a response rate of 87.13 mA W&#8722;1. This finding provides a new approach to designing stable heterojunction photoelectrocatalysts with isotropy</description>

      <title>An efficient Z-type CeO2/BiOBr heterostructure with enhanced photo-oxidation degradation of o-DCB and CO2 reduction ability</title>

                The Z-type CeO2/BiOBr heterostructures were skilfully designed by assembling CeO2 nanoparticles onto the surface of BiOBr microflowers. This composite photocatalyst demonstrates efficient photo-oxidation degradation ability for o-DCB and CO2 reduction ability. Through analyses of its morphology, microstructure, XPS spectra, low-temperature ESR, SPV, and charge transfer dynamics (TPV and TR-PL), the paper elucidates the superior performance of the CeO2/BiOBr composite and discusses its photocatalytic mechanism. The enhanced photo-oxidation degradation ability and CO2 reduction performance of the heterostructure, compared to the individual CeO2 and BiOBr components, indicate that this Z-scheme microstructure effectively promotes the recombination of photogenerated holes the valence band (VB) of the BiOBr with the electrons in the conduction band (CB) of the CeO2, leading to the abundant carriers surviving in the corresponding energy bands. This study provides valuable insights into the rational design of Z-type heterostructures for advanced photocatalytic applications.</description>

                Abstract Climate change mitigation through negative CO 2 emissions has been recognized as a crucial strategy to combat global warming. However, its potential effects on terrestrial productivity and agricultural activities remain uncertain. In this study, we utilized large ensemble simulations with an Earth system model of full complexity to investigate the response of Gross Primary Production (GPP) to CO 2 forcings. Our findings reveal a significant asymmetry in the GPP response to CO 2 ramp-up and symmetric ramp-down model experiments, especially in Europe, suggesting that GPP declines rapidly as CO 2 levels decrease. Remarkably, during the CO 2 removal period, the North Atlantic Sea surface temperature experienced cooling due to a delayed recovery of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). This cooling led to precipitation and soil moisture deficits, resulting in a rapid reduction in GPP. This asymmetry in GPP response holds consistent across multi-model simulations. These results underscore the potential implications of delayed recovery in ocean circulation, which could unexpectedly accelerate terrestrial GPP reduction. These insights are crucial for policymakers, aiding them in projecting agricultural activity and formulating targeted GPP control policies specific to the European region.</description>

      <title>Carbon Pricing Impacts on Four Pollutants: A Cross-Country Analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17112596</link>
      <description>Rohan Best, Fatemeh Nazifi, Han Cheng, Energies. 17(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399091965

                Research on climate change mitigation has increasingly considered carbon pricing, with these efforts concentrating on reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Our comprehensive cross-country analysis extends this focus by quantitatively evaluating the effects of carbon pricing on four major pollutants: CO2, nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and particulate matter (PM). We use regressions and introduce entropy balancing to this research area. Analyzing data from 132 countries from 1992 to 2019, we find that carbon pricing is associated with an average annual reduction in CO2 emissions by 3 percentage points. A one-unit increase in a coverage-weighted carbon price is associated with reductions in N2O emissions by approximately 0.1 percentage points. A shorter panel for 2010&#8211;2017 shows a larger impact of 0.3 percentage points for PM. These findings underline the efficacy of carbon pricing not just in curtailing CO2 but in significantly mitigating other harmful pollutants on a global scale. Reductions in pollutants beyond CO2 provide further motivation for policymakers to pursue carbon pricing.</description>

                Summary This research investigates the feasibility of using Redcar Mudstone formation in the UK for carbon dioxide sequestration through mineral carbonation and enhanced weathering. Given the urgency of reducing atmospheric CO2 levels, it is essential to explore carbon dioxide removal methods such as mineral carbonation and enhanced weathering. These methods aim to accelerate natural CO2 reducing reactions involving alkaline minerals, potentially leading to the formation of stable carbonate minerals that can securely sequester CO2. The study conducted various experiments under different conditions, including high-pressure/temperature experiment, column experiment and CO2 incubator experiments. The results demonstrated that high pressure/temperature conditions were particularly effective for mineral carbonation, with the formation of stable calcite indicative of successful CO2 capture. The pH levels decreased across all experiments, confirming the acidification of the system and promoting further reactions with CO2. The research suggests that RM, with its abundant clay minerals, can be a suitable medium for CO2 sequestration through both mineral carbonation and enhanced weathering. RM's potential reactivity and scalability make it a promising candidate for carbon capture technologies, offering a passive and continuous approach for CO2 reduction.</description>

                Industrial exhaust gases and gas fields are two significant sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that contribute to the rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. Among the various emission reduction systems, the CCSU (Carbon Capture, Storage, and Utilization) system has garnered extensive attention and research. This research aims to obtain the superstructure network sequentially in the CCSU system using GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System). A mathematical approach was developed to optimize the amount of CO2 stored and utilized by varying the time difference (dt) between the source and sink from 0 to 10 years. After calculating the economic potential (EP), it was found that the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) system for both sources has a negative impact. In contrast, the CCSU system enhances the economic potential (EP) by generating a positive value. This is possible as the captured CO2 can be sold to the utilization sink, thereby creating a revenue stream. The EP for CO2 reduction from gas fields is greater than that from the industry, 21.68 &#215; 106 USD compared to 12.50 &#215; 106 USD at dt min10 years. The CCSU system, when utilizing CO2 sources from gas fields, is more profitable compared to using industrial emissions.</description>

                Transformation of carbon dioxide and nitrate ions into urea offers an attractive route for both nitrogen fertilizer production and environmental remediation. However, achieving this transformation under mild conditions remains challenging. Herein, we report an efficient photoelectrochemical method for urea synthesis by co&#8208;reduction of carbon dioxide and nitrate ion over a Cu2O photocathode, delivering urea formation rate of 29.71&#177;2.20 &#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 12.90&#177;1.15 % at low external potential (&#8722;0.017 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). Experimental data combined with theoretical calculations suggest that the adsorbed CO* and NO2* species are the key intermediates, and associated C&#8722;N coupling is the rate&#8208;determining step. This work demonstrates that Cu2O is an efficient catalyst to drive co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722; to urea under light irradiation with low external potential, showing great opportunity of photoelectrocatalysis as a sustainable tool for value&#8208;added chemical synthesis.</description>

      <title>Effect of ammonia energy ratio and load on combustion and emissions of an ammonia/diesel dual-fuel engine</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2024.131860</link>
      <description>Yanhui Chen, Jian Zhang, Zhiqing Zhang, Bin Zhang, Jingyi Hu, Weihuang Zhong, Yanshuai Ye, Energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399142958

                Ammonia is receiving increasing attention as a zero-carbon fuel. However, it is difficult to use alone because of its high auto-ignition temperature. Therefore, in this paper, the effects of four ammonia energy ratios (15%, 30%, 45%, and 60%) on the combustion and emission characteristics of the engine at different loads were studied by using the ammonia/diesel dual-fuel strategy. The results indicated that the presence of ammonia lowered the combustion temperature at all loads, thereby lowering the cylinder temperature and cylinder pressure. In addition, the HRR first increased and then decreased as the ignition delay increased with the increase in ammonia energy ratio. In terms of emissions, at 100% load, the CO2 and NO of the D40A60 were 65.5% and 88.14% lower than that of the D100. The decrease in CO2 was due to more carbon-based fuels being replaced by ammonia. The decrease in NO was due to the decomposition of NO by the thermal deNOx reaction resulting from the lower combustion temperature. The emissions of N2O produced by partial ammonia oxidation offset the greenhouse gas emission reduction effect caused by the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Further optimization of the engine combustion strategy is still needed in the future.</description>

                In recent years, boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes have attained great significance and emerged as outstanding potential candidates for electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion to valuable products. The features like chemical stability, abundant economical raw material, and long cyclic stability of BDD electrodes made them highly competitive as compared to the conventional metal-based electrodes. However, the direction of research approach is not focused and not adequate for improvement in the design, yield, and selectivity. Most of the countries have targeted the achievement of "net zero", i.e., utmost removal of CO2 from the atmosphere that has been emitted by human activities within the next decade. In this context, we have reviewed electrochemical CO2 reduction using a diamond electrode. In this mini-review, we used the curated literature available in the CAS content collection to present a systematic analysis of the various approaches applied by scientists on recent developments on BDD electrodes for electrochemical reduction of CO2. More significantly, we wisely addressed the challenges and future perspectives to improve the yield and selectivity of CO2 reduction products as a direction to researchers in this field. Multiple strategies have been discussed allied to tackle the high overpotential and low carbon monoxide yield issues. The review highlights the current status and developments with focus on understanding the reaction mechanisms, impact of dopant concentration on performance, improved electrolyte designs, surface characteristics, choice of electrolytes, and challenges such as low yield and unsatisfactory selectivity of BDD based CO2 electroreduction. Our analysis highlights the latest trends alongside the associated challenges with BDD based CO2 electroreduction and future direction for researchers.</description>

      <title>Sustainability in Vietnam: Examining Economic Growth, Energy, Innovation, Agriculture, and Forests' Impact on CO2 Emissions</title>

                Global warming, induced by human-generated greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide (CO2), threatens the planet's ecology, economic development, and long-term viability in unparalleled ways. Vietnam's utilization of energy and CO2 emanations are on the increase as a consequence of the country's increasing economic and improving agricultural practices. Governments seeking to accomplish an equilibrium between combating climate change and sustainable development would benefit from a deeper understanding of Vietnam's climate change vulnerability. A better understanding of the trade-off between pollution and economic growth is crucial if Vietnam is to slow the rate at which its environment is being damaged. So, the current study empirically examined the connections between GDP development, energy consumption, technical advancement, agricultural output, forest region, and carbon dioxide emissions in Vietnam. This study collected annual data from 1990 to 2020 and analyzed it using the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares method. Based on the projection, Vietnam experiences a direct correlation between energy consumption and CO2 emissions. This implies that an increase in energy consumption and economic growth corresponds to a corresponding emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that this pattern might be alleviated by means of technological innovations, increased agricultural output, and initiatives to broaden forested regions. A negative correlation exists between these variables and CO2 emissions; technological innovations, more sustainable agricultural methods, and forest preservation initiatives may contribute to the gradual reduction of CO2 emissions. Therefore, environmental sustainability could be achieved through reduced emissions if the policies advocated in this article were implemented. Some of these policies include using renewable energy sources, encouraging innovations in technology, encouraging climate-conscious agriculture, and encouraging careful forest management.</description>

                The escalating atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) due to human pursuit which includes fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and industrial production make contributions considerably to international warming and climate change. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and usage (CCU) technology provide viable solutions for mitigating those emissions. This paper critiques various CCS and CCU techniques that specialize of their ability applications, stressful situations, and environmental impacts. While CCS technologies provide promising consequences in decreasing international warming capability, they're associated with better acidification and human toxicity in comparison to standard techniques. Alternatively, CCU technologies present an opportunity to convert CO2 into valuable products, thereby imparting a sustainable approach to greenhouse gas reduction. But, these technology face challenges consisting of high expenses, energy consequences, and the need for social recognition. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of modern CCS and CCU technologies, evaluates their environmental affects, and discusses future prospects for their implementation in reducing industrial CO2 emissions.</description>

                Regulators across the world introduce measures to improve the energy consumption and greenhouse emissions of road-vehicles. The present study focuses on the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Fuel Efficiency standards attempting an evaluation of their effectiveness, using vehicle and fleet modelling. The model has been validated against certified values, and was subsequently used to calculate real-world fleet performance in an effort to quantify the actual emissions savings. To obtain a robust counterfactual result, two regions are compared as a case study: the European Union (EU), where CO2 emissions have been regulated for more than fifteen years, and Australia, a region without such regulation. The average difference of the certified CO2 emissions registered in the two regions increased from 50 g/km in 2018 to 60 g/km in 2021 due to accelerated electrification in the EU. The real-world CO2 emissions in the registered fleets for 2021 were estimated to be 143 g/km and 207 g/km for the EU and Australia respectively, a difference of 45%. Projections of the influence on the total in-use CO2 emissions of the new vehicles demonstrate the importance of deploying standards in a way that promotes efficiency and weight reduction in addition to absolute tailpipe emissions reduction.</description>

      <title>Bioconversion of carbon dioxide and zero valent iron to methane by anaerobic sludge: Kinetics and archaeal consortium</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202453003004</link>
      <description>Vichai Domrongpokkaphan, Chantaraporn Phalakornkule, Maneerat Khemkhao, E3S web of conferences. 530(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399150692

                Using carbon dioxide (CO2) as a carbon source for renewable energy production has potential applications for CO2 sequestration and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction. In biological conversion, CO2 can be transformed into methane (CH4) by hydrogenotrophic methanogens with hydrogen (H2) as an energy source. In this study, zero-valent iron (ZVI) of 16, 32, 64, and 96 g/L was used as the H2 energy source for a bioconversion of CO2 to CH4. When the ZVI dosage was increased, a decrease in CO2 in the headspace occurred simultaneously with the increase in CH4. The presence of CH4 in both CO2/H2 and CO2/ZVI indicates that hydrogenotrophic methanogens can utilize both ZVI and H2 as electron donors and convert CO2 to CH4. The highest methane yield of 1.728 mmol CH4/mmol CO2 was observed for the CO2/ZVI 96 g/L. The modified Gompertz equation fitted the cumulative CH4 production curves of CO2/H2 and CO2/ZVI very well, where R 2 was 0.9915 and 0.9903-0.9968, respectively. 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing results revealed that ZVI addition facilitated the increase of the family Methanobacteriaceae, which became the most abundant among other archaea. It points out that this family favors ZVI and utilizes electrons more effectively from ZVI than H2.</description>

      <description>Achinta Bera, S. Satapathy, Jyothi Daneti, Energy &amp; fuels. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399197439

                The motivation behind the advancement of novel technologies for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) originates from the increasing energy demand and imperative to explore new oil reserves. Novel approaches, including the injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) and sequestration of CO2 in oil reservoirs, have emerged as potential remedies. In response to the rising apprehensions regarding global warming attributed to anthropogenic activities and the consequent rise in CO2 emissions, scholars are directing their attention toward the utilization of CO2 sequestration methods for EOR. This methodology presents an achievable strategy to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions and diminish their influence on the atmosphere. The implementation of CO2 sequestration in EOR operations has the potential to yield the dual benefits of cost reduction and additional oil recovery. The paper presents a study that investigates distinct scenarios of CO2 injection and sequestration in various formations. The study incorporates conventional methodologies, such as gas injection, for the purpose of EOR. It explores diverse fields of CO2 injection and sequestration, deliberates on the decision-making process concerning injection strategies, and employs dynamic as well as static models to generate long-term production profiles, evaluate production profiles, and manage the process. The paper explores the challenges encountered by various industries in the process of capturing, transporting, and storing of CO2 in geological formations. Additionally, the study assesses the geological potential and practicality of implementing this methodology in India. In brief, this study presents a thorough examination of Indian scenarios for CO2 injection and sequestration utilized in EOR techniques.</description>

      <title>Climate and air quality benefits of wind and solar generation in the United States from 2019 to 2022</title>

                Wind and solar generation reduce electric sector pollutant emissions and associated climate-related damages and air quality-related health damages. Here, we assess these emission reductions, focusing on carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx), and incorporate recent estimates of global warming costs and pollution health costs to estimate the dollar value of the associated climate and air quality benefits. From 2019 through 2022, wind and solar generation in the United States provided $249 billion of climate and air quality benefits based on central estimates. In 2022, the normalized benefits were $143/MWh and $100/MWh for wind and solar, respectively, or $36/MWh and $17/MWh when only including air quality benefits. Combined, wind and solar generation led to 1,200 to 1,600 fewer premature mortalities in 2022 (based on a 5th&#8211;95th percentile range). Our approach is based on simple, publicly available data, and it includes a sophisticated treatment of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Novel wastewater recovery process for sustainable sodium carbonate production with CO2 and SOx utilization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcou.2024.102824</link>
      <description>Jongmin Choi, Jonghun Lim, Yurim Kim, Seongbin Ga, Junghwan Kim, Journal of CO2 utilization. 83(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399239965

                Ammonia-soda process, which produce soda ash, emits flue gas containing a large amount of CO2 and SOx. The wastewater discharged from the ammonia-soda process contains cations, such as Na+ and Ca2+, which can be recovered and reacted with a CO2 and SOx. In this study, we designed a CO2 and SOx utilization process for the sustainable production of sodium carbonate using wastewater recovery system, extracting Na+ and Ca2+. The proposed process involved the following steps: (1) metal-ion separation, which produces NaOH and Ca(OH)2; (2) capture and utilization of SOx using Ca(OH)2; and (3) capture and utilization of CO2 using NaOH and Ca(OH)2, respectively. The economic feasibility of the proposed process was verified by comparing its total annualized cost (TAC) with those of conventional processes. Approximately 99% of SOx was captured to produce high-purity desulfurized gypsum, and 99% of CO2 was captured to be transformed into CaCO3. To confirm the CO2 reduction of the process, the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) was calculated by evaluating the amount of greenhouse gases. The CO2e decreased to 71.4% compared with that of the conventional process. The TAC of the proposed process decreased by 10.67% and 19.63% compared with that of the ammonia-soda and Hou processes, respectively. Thus, this study proposes an industrially potential process design for sustainable sodium carbonate production by utilizing CO2 and SOx with wastewater recycling, without additional reactants, making it more economically viable.</description>

      <title>Predicted C&#8211;N Coupling Performance of Lateral Heterostructure Interfaces between Two Types of Layered Materials for Electrochemical Synthesis of Acetamide and Ammonia Via Coreduction of Co2 and N2</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4851398</link>

                Currently, carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) can convert CO2 into many high-value hydrocarbon chemicals via electrochemical processes, contributing to achieving energy conservation and emission reduction. Importantly, this method also guides the electrocatalytic synthesis of organonitrogen chemicals via C&#8211;C and C&#8211;N coupling, such as acetamide synthesis during the coelectroreduction of CO2 and N2. Herein, we utilized density functional theory calculations to predict the C&#8211;N coupling performance of *CCO and NH3 for acetamide synthesis on lateral heterostructure (LHS) interfaces of two types of layered materials: Type-A includes NbS2/MoS2, NbS2/TaS2, NbS2/WS2, MoS2/TaS2, and TaS2/WS2; Type-B contains LHS NbS2/AlN, NbS2/GaN, NbS2/ZnO, MoS2/AlN, MoS2/GaN, MoS2/ZnO, TaS2/AlN, TaS2/GaN, TaS2/ZnO, and WS2/AlN, WS2/GaN, WS2/ZnO. However, achieving simultaneous C&#8211;C coupling and C&#8211;N coupling remains a great challenge in designing catalysts. To address this, we systemically investigated these LHS catalysts, evaluating factors such as adsorption stability, electroconductivity, catalytic activity, selectivity, and electronic properties. Our findings suggest that MoS2/WS2 and NbS2/ZnO may be potential catalysts, facilitating acetamide synthesis from CO2 and N2 reduction with low limiting potentials of &#8722;1.11 and &#8722;0.97 V, respectively. The reaction pathway of CO2RR involves the formation of CO, C&#8211;C coupling via keto&#8722;enol tautomerism to form ketene (*CCO), N2 reduction, and C&#8211;N coupling between NH3 and *CCO to produce *CC(OH)NH2, finally resulting in acetamide production. Most of these LHS junction catalysts exhibit metallic and semiconductor electronic states, except for MoS2/GaN, which possesses a large band gap of up to 3.73 eV. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that NbS2/AlN, NbS2/GaN, TaS2/ZnO, WS2/AlN, and WS2/ZnO effectively suppress competing byproducts, ensuring the formation of *CCO and promoting nucleophilic reactions leading to *CC(OH)NH2 during *CC(OH)NH2. This strategic approach enables the synthesis of organonitrogen chemicals via C&#8211;N coupling in the coreduction of CO2 and NOx, expanding the scope of hydrocarbon products derived from CO2RR. The LHS catalysts identified in this study may be employed to form amide chemicals.</description>

      <title>Chemical and biological effects of zero-valent iron (ZVI) concentration on in-situ production of H2 from ZVI and bioconversion of CO2 into CH4 under anaerobic conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2024.119230</link>
      <description>Maneerat Khemkhao, Vichai Domrongpokkaphan, Sasikarn Nuchdang, Chantaraporn Phalakornkule, Environmental research. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399051734

                The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) is a strategy for sequestering CO2. Zero-valent iron (ZVI) has been proposed as an alternative electron donor for the CO2 reduction to CH4. In this study, the effects of ZVI concentrations on the abiotic production of H2 (without the action of microorganisms) in the first part and on the biological conversion of CO2 to CH4 using ZVI as a direct electron donor in the second part were examined. In the abiotic H2 production, the increase in the ZVI concentration from 16 to 32, 64, and 96 g/L was found to have positive effects on both the amounts of H2 generated and the rates of H2 production because the extent of ZVI oxidation positively correlates with increasing surface area. Nevertheless, the increase in ZVI concentration from 96 to 224 g/L did not benefit the H2 production because the ZVI dissolution was suppressed by the increasing aqueous pH above 10. In the bioconversion of CO2 to CH4 using ZVI as an electron donor, the main methanogenesis pathway occurred via hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis at pH 8.7&#8211;9.5 driven by the genus Methanobacterium of the class Methanobacteria. At ZVI concentrations of 64 g/L and above, the production of volatile fatty acid (VFA) became clear. Acetate was the main VFA, indicating the induction of homoacetogenesis at ZVI concentrations of 64 g/L and above. In addition, the presence of propionate as the second major VFA suggests the production of propionate from CO2 and acetate under conditions with high H2 partial pressure. The results indicated that the pathway for ZVI/CO2 conversion to CH4 was competitive between hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis.</description>

                Electrolysis of bicarbonate&#8208;containing CO2 capture solutions is a promising approach towards achieving low&#8208;cost carbon&#8208;neutral chemicals production. However, the parasitic bicarbonate&#8208;mediated hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and electrode instability in the presence of trace impurities remain major obstacles to overcome. This work demonstrates that the combined use of titanium dioxide (TiO2) overlayers with the chelating agent ethylene diamine tetra&#8208;acetic acid (EDTA) significantly enhances the selectivity and stability of Ag&#8208;based electrocatalysts for bicarbonate electrolysis. The amorphous TiO2 overlayers suppress the HER by over 50% at potentials more negative than &#8208;0.7 V vs. RHE, increasing the CO faradaic efficiency (FE) by 33% (relative). In situ surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) measurements reveal the absence of near&#8208;surface bicarbonate species and an abundance of CO2 reduction intermediates at the Ag|TiO2 buried interface, suggesting that the overlayers suppress HER by blocking bicarbonate ions from reaching the buried active sites. In accelerated degradation tests with 5 ppm of Fe(III) impurity, the addition of EDTA allows stable CO production with &gt;47% FE, while the electrodes rapidly deactivate in the absence of EDTA. This work highlights the use of TiO2 overlayers for enhancing the CO:H2 ratio while simultaneously protecting electrocatalysts from impurities likely to be present in &#8220;open&#8221; carbon capture systems.</description>

      <title>Embodied Carbon in New Zealand Commercial Construction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17112629</link>
      <description>David H. Finnie, Rehan Masood, Seth Goldsworthy, Benjamin Harding, Energies. 17(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399185883

                Decarbonization is gaining priority from the macro to the micro level. However, achieving this is a critical challenge, as industries are still immature. This study explores the practices used to calculate and reduce embodied carbon (EC) in New Zealand (NZ) commercial construction projects. In the Paris Agreement, NZ pledged to reduce its net GHG emissions to 50 percent below the gross 2005 levels by 2030. The built environment generates approximately 40% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with 11% being generated by manufacturing materials. EC represents carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the atmosphere throughout the extraction, fabrication, transportation, and assembly of building materials. A survey questionnaire was distributed to stakeholders in commercial construction via the New Zealand Institute of Quantity Surveyors (NZIQS) open forum. Twenty-seven valid responses were analyzed. The survey tested and expanded on the interview findings. Calculating and reducing EC are not mandatory in NZ. Most industry professionals had yet to experience EC calculation in projects. Clients most commonly drive EC reduction in public projects with calculations that are often conducted during the concept or detailed design stages. The challenges in measuring and lowering EC include a lack of client willingness to fund EC calculation, lack of knowledge and experience, lack of previous cost data, lack of EC materials, and lack of fit-for-purpose EC calculation tools. These findings may inform NZ government policy initiatives supporting EC reduction to meet their 2050 target.</description>

      <title>Additive effects of basalt enhanced weathering and biochar co-application on carbon sequestration, soil nutrient status and plant performance in a mesocosm experiment</title>

                Co-deployment of a portfolio of carbon removal technologies is anticipated in order to remove several gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and meet climate targets. However, co-application effects between carbon removal technologies have rarely been examined, despite multiple recent perspectives suggesting potential synergies between basalt enhanced weathering and biochar application. To study the co-application effects of basalt for enhanced weathering and biochar on carbon sequestration, along with related co-benefits and risks, we conducted a fully replicated factorial mesocosm experiment with wheat. Basalt applied alone (74 t ha-1) resulted in an estimated carbon sequestration potential of 1.13 t of equivalent CO2 ha-1 over the course of approximately 6 months. Co-application with biochar (12 t ha-1) did not significantly increase estimated carbon sequestration potential. Total alkalinity fluxes and isotopic evidence indicated nearly exactly additive effects of basalt and biochar co-applied, with no significant interaction effect. Biochar carbon sequestration, approximately 32 t of equivalent CO2 ha-1 in our experiment, was unaffected by basalt addition during our experiment. Co-benefits of basalt and biochar on plant biomass as well as nutrient uptake and availability similarly mostly showed additive tendencies when co-applied. Nonetheless, a few synergistic tendencies were observed when co-applied for plant potassium and magnesium uptake as well as soil calcium availability. Soil calcium availability increased by 126% compared to expected effects based on separate application. Finally, we did not observe a reduction in the increased uptake of potentially harmful trace elements released from basalt when co-applied with biochar. Overall, our results support the co-application of basalt for enhanced weathering and biochar, with additive effects on carbon sequestration and additive, if not synergistic, effects on associated co-benefits.</description>

      <title>Biogas upgrading to biomethane with zeolite membranes: separation performance and economic analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cherd.2024.05.042</link>

                Biogas represents an important renewable source alternative to fossil fuels, which can significantly contribute to the reduction of global warming and the gradual decarbonisation. In this work, the purification of CH4 and CO2 from a biogas mixture was investigated using DD3R zeolite membrane modules, as a possible solution to replace the traditional techniques at higher environmental impact (i.e., solvent absorption and cryogenic distillation). Multistage membrane configurations operating at 25&#176;C and 30 bar were proposed and explored to get highly pure biomethane (concentration of 98%) and carbon dioxide (concentration of 99.5%), imposing a recovery of both the species higher than 90%. Then, an economic analysis was carried out, evaluating the economic potential of each configuration as a function of several parameters, such as membrane module cost, biomethane selling price, CO2 permeance, CO2/CH4 selectivity, feed flow rate and pressure. The multistage schemes were found to be promising in a wide range of zeolite membrane module cost (i.e., up to 2000 $/m2), providing positive values of the economic potential, due to the good recovery of both the components, which produced high revenues. The increment of the CO2 permeance and, especially, of the feed flow rate (i.e., plant size) allowed for a more profitable process. In particular, if feed flow rate increased from 100 to 1000 Nm3/h, the economic potential would grow of about 12 times, from 113 to 1370 thousand dollars per year. Hence, this preliminary economic assessment showed that zeolite membranes can be successfully used in biogas treatment to get pure CH4 and CO2. Such an analysis can be applied to any membrane materials, once permeance and selectivity are fixed.</description>

                Many regard the construction industry as a non-sustainable sector due to its energy-intensive activities, coupled with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and low productivity. According to a recent United Nations Environment Program report, building and construction account for 36% of global energy use and 37% of energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas emissions. Concerning the current emerging rules and regulations related to sustainability, Canada has introduced the 2030 emission reduction plan, which aims to achieve clean air and a strong economy. The 2030 plan is a detailed road map that outlines a sector-by-sector path for Canada to reach its emissions reduction target of 40% below 2005 levels by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050, and it is intended to be continuously updated. The construction industry is also involved in the 2030 emission reduction plan, as it has a prominent role in generating emissions during the life cycle of its projects. Therefore, the construction industry has no option but to shift gradually toward achieving sustainability. The core concept of sustainable construction is to maximize value and minimize harm by achieving a balance between social, economic, technical, and environmental aspects, commonly known as the pillars of sustainability. In general, the integration of sustainability in any construction project remains a complex and open issue due to the involvement of a large number of factors influencing the decision. This paper analyzed significant factors causing greenhouse gas emissions considering the project's complete life cycle and developed a framework to suggest action plans to reduce those gradually. The outcome is expected to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration among researchers, industry practitioners and policymakers to integrate the information available to support decision-making to achieve net-zero GHG emissions targets in construction.</description>

      <title>Performance Investigation of Spark Ignition Engines (SIE) using Biofuel Blended with N-Propanol Fuel Additive</title>

                This experiment studies the suitability of n-propanol in biofuel for the performance improvement of the Spark Ignition Engine (SIE). Literature reported performance limitations of SIE with Ethanol-Gasoline (EG) blends. N-propanol can be an additive due to its good calorific value and non-separating properties. Various blends such as EG, Propanol-Gasoline (PG), and Propanol-Ethanol-Gasoline (PEG) were tested to assert their best potential in an SIE. Experimentation was conducted on a 4-stroke petrol test engine running at 2800 rpm with low fuel blend concentrations and varying Compression Ratio (CR) to investigate its effects on the performance of SIE. Increasing CR improved PEG-fueled engine performance more than gasoline-fueled engines, such as Brake Thermal Efficiency (BTE) and Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC), and decreased emissions like Carbon Dioxides (CO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Unburnt Hydrocarbons (HCs). The performance of SIE mainly compared E10 (10% ethanol in gasoline) and E10Pr1.5 (10% ethanol and 1.5% propanol in gasoline) biofuels at different CRs. As compared to E10, E10Pr1.5 reported an increase in BTE from 0.43-0.83%, a significant decrease in BSFC from 0.05-0.37%, a reduction in CO emission from 6.85-9.78%, and a decline in HCs emission from 2.16-3.69%, at different CRs (4.67-7.5) respectively. Results show that a 1.5% addition of propanol in E10 biofuel improves the performance of SIE compared to pure gasoline and EG blend with 10% ethanol in gasoline. E10Pr1.5 shows the highest BTE, lowest BSFC, and lowest emissions of CO and HCs for different CRs. Propanol can be used as a fuel additive in the EG biofuel.</description>

      <title>An Integrated Multi-Criteria Decision Support Model for Sustainable Ship Queuing Policy Application via Vessel Traffic Service (VTS)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114615</link>

                The International Maritime Organization (IMO) persistently improves policies to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from maritime operations, emphasizing the significance of operational measures. Simultaneously, heightened recognition of collaborative efforts within the maritime sector has increased the applicability of arrival policies like Just-In-Time Arrival (JITA), aimed at curtailing unnecessary anchorage time and emissions affecting adjacent communities in port vicinities. Nevertheless, ongoing initiatives advocate adopting JITA over the prevailing First Come, First Served (FCFS) policy, which is perceived as inefficient and, in the meantime, fair in the shipping industry. This research introduces an integrated decision support model to facilitate the implementation of a sustainable ship queuing policy by the VTS. The model addresses critical concerns, including the priorities of relevant authorities, the duration of nautical services for incoming vessels, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions attributable to anchorage waiting times. The decision support framework presented integrates the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and PROMETHEE II methodologies; the study&#8217;s outcomes suggest that the model significantly reduces ships&#8217; unnecessary CO2 emissions during anchorage waiting periods compared to the FCFS policy, with reduction rates ranging from 32.8% to 45% based on case analysis. Moreover, the proposed model ensures fairness by treating competing arriving ships equitably according to predefined criteria.</description>

                Summary COP28 closed with a historic agreement signalling the "transitioning away' from fossil fuels by laying the ground for a swift, just and equitable transition, underpinned by deep emissions cuts and scaled-up finance. Capturing and storing gigatonnes of CO2 annually is crucial for a just and sustainable transition to net-zero emissions by 2050 as CCS technology offers the potential to significantly reduce emissions from energy and industrial processes and enable large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Leveraging 40 years of CCS history, new and impactful collaborations between experts in the CCS industry and pioneering research groups, equipped with the pan-European ECCSEL research infrastructure, will create competitive CCS technologies, increase value, and reduce risk for industry and society through strategic competence and capacity building, supporting the achievement of emissions reduction targets. Since the pace of CCS implementation is of the utmost importance, industrial actors must make use of existing CCS knowledge to secure the necessary investments. It is essential that research and industry work closely together to secure knowledge that can be used for deployment, as well as research new challenges that arise from deployment activities.</description>

      <title>On the Post-Heat Behavior of Cement Mortar Containing Mechanically Modified Ground Coal Bottom Ash</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.56294/sctconf2024813</link>
      <description>Mohammad I. Al Biajawi, Rahimah Embong, Khairunisa Muthusamy, Haneen Abdel Jabar, Nahla Hilal, Fadzli Mohamed Nazri, Salud, Ciencia y Tecnolog&#237;a - Serie de Conferencias. 3(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399213652

                Coal is widely recognized as a significant and essential fuel source due to its capacity to undergo combustion and produce heat in many different regions worldwide. Over the course of many decades, there has been a notable rise in power usage among individuals, thus resulting in an upsurge in the utilization of coal. The growth of mankind has a parallel rising trajectory with the utilization of cement in the building industry, as well as a corresponding rise in cement manufacturing. These two phenomena significantly contribute to the escalation of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the improper disposal of coal ash, both of which pose significant environmental hazards. Coal-fired thermal power plants generate many waste products from industry, including coal-bottom ash (CBA), which may be effectively used in the production of mortar or concrete. This practice not only promotes the adoption of sustainable construction materials but also encourages the utilization of these wastes. In contrast, it is worth noting that cement manufacture yields a significant quantity of carbon dioxide emissions, so exerting a detrimental influence on the ecosystem. The reduction of environmental deterioration may be achieved by substituting cement with waste products. The substitution of Portland cement with reutilized coal combustion products has the potential to provide significant environmental and infrastructural advantages. This study presents an experimental investigation into the post-heat performance of cement mortars including ground coal bottom ash (CBA). To achieve this objective, an investigation was conducted to assess the strength qualities, residual strength, and mass losses of mortar specimens. These specimens comprised varying proportions (10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%) of CBA as a substitute for cement. To perform the heating procedure, samples were subjected to temperatures of 200&#176;C, 400&#176;C, and 600&#176;C, which corresponded to room temperatures. The findings indicate that the use of ground CBA up to a proportion of 20% yields mortar with the maximum value of compressive strength compared with the control sample. The use of a substantial amount of ground CBA has been shown to produce the most significant reduction in mass and decrease in strength when subjected to high temperatures. As a result, the residual strength of concrete experiences a decrease of 33.65% when exposed to a temperature of 600&#176;C in conventional concrete while for CBA in concrete decreases around 40.9% . In general, the integration of ground CBA alternatives as an alternative to cement would result in a decrease in the need for the manufacture of cement and the environmental pollution associated with CBA discharge.</description>

      <title>Effect of outdoor ageing on pyrolytic characteristics and kinetics of different organic components in waste photovoltaic panels</title>

                Pyrolysis is a potential approach for volume reduction and utilization of organic components in waste photovoltaic panels. During a usage period of 20-25 years, the physical and chemical properties of photovoltaic panels might undergo ageing and deterioration, thereby affecting their thermal decomposition characteristics. The characteristics of samples before and after ageing were studied using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, elemental analyzer, and thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy-mass spectrometry. There were certain differences in the weight loss temperature, time, residual mass, and activation energy of the samples in the pyrolysis reaction. After ageing, the production of acetic acid and methane in ethylene vinyl acetate pyrolysis products increased, while the production of CO2 decreased. After ageing, Tedlar-Polyethylene Terephalate-Tedlar mainly produced water, carbon dioxide, and fluorocarbon compounds, and the percentage of harmful fluorocarbon compounds in the human body increased. Cyclosiloxane, CO2, and hydrocarbons containing C-H bond were detected in each weight-loss stage of aged silica gel. As the heating rate changed, the amount of pyrolysis products also changed. Controlling the sample's heating rate would help to lessen the quantity of hazardous pollutants that were produced. The influence of ageing on the weight loss of mixed samples was discussed. This study seeks to give a fundamental understanding of the physicochemical properties, pyrolysis behaviour, and volatiles of samples before and after ageing, thus providing helpful insights for the final disposal or recovery of waste photovoltaic panels through pyrolysis.</description>

                Abstract To achieve the Paris climate target, deep emissions reductions have to be complemented with carbon dioxide removal (CDR). However, a portfolio of CDR options is necessary to reduce risks and potential negative side effects. Despite a large theoretical potential, ocean-based CDR such as ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) has been omitted in climate change mitigation scenarios so far. In this study, we provide a techno-economic assessment of large-scale OAE using hydrated lime (&#8216;ocean liming&#8217;). We address key uncertainties that determine the overall cost of ocean liming such as the CO2 uptake efficiency per unit of material, distribution strategies avoiding carbonate precipitation which would compromise efficiency, and technology availability (e.g., solar calciners). We find that at economic costs of 130 to 295 $/tCO2 net-removed, ocean liming could be a competitive CDR option which could make a significant contribution towards the Paris climate target. As the techno-economic assessment identified no showstoppers, we argue for more research on ecosystem impacts, governance, monitoring, reporting, and verification, and technology development and assessment to determine whether ocean liming and other OAE should be considered as part of a broader CDR portfolio.&amp;#xD;</description>

      <title>Efficacy of Salvia officinalis Shrub as a Sustainable Feed Additive for Reducing Ruminal Methane Production and Enhancing Fermentation in Ruminants</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ani14111648</link>

                The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the inclusion of dried Salvia officinalis (SO) shrub leaves on nutrient degradability, ruminal in vitro fermentation, gas production (GP), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) productions. Dried and ground SO shrub leaves were included at 0% (control), 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and 2% DM of a diet consisting of (per kg DM) 500 g concentrate feed mixture, 400 g berseem hay, and 100 g rice straw. The diet was incubated for 48 h. The asymptotic GP and the rate of GP changed linearly and quadratically (p &lt; 0.01), with the highest GP observed at 1% inclusion of SO and then decreasing thereafter with greater inclusion (i.e., 1.5% and 2%), while CH4 production and its rate decreased linearly (p &lt; 0.01) with all levels of SO inclusion. A linear increase in CO2 production and its rate was also found with an increasing level of SO inclusion in the diet (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the degradability of DM, NDF, and the concentration of total short-chain fatty acids and acetate changed linearly and quadratically, with the greatest being found at 1% SO inclusion and then steadily declining after (p &lt; 0.01) with the 1.5% and 2% inclusion levels. Meanwhile, the propionate, NH3-N, and microbial crude protein levels showed similar trends, with the plateau found at 1% inclusion of SO, where there was no change in butyrate concentration. Moreover, the pH, metabolizable energy, and partitioning factor (PF24) also changed linearly and quadratically (p &lt; 0.05), where the pH and PF24 were considerably reduced and ME increased with a 1% inclusion of SO (p &lt; 0.05). In summary, SO at 1% inclusion in the diet showed the potential to improve gas production kinetics, nutrient degradability, and the ruminal fermentation profile, with a more significant reduction in ruminal CH4 production suggesting that SO at 1% could be included in the ruminant diet to reduce their carbon footprint and increase the production performance.</description>

                The China-Europe Railway Express (CRE) has attracted and fostered low-carbon, export-oriented manufacturing industry; thus, it could reduce carbon dioxide emissions through manufacturing industry substitution effect. To verify this new mechanism, this study focuses on a specific case, namely, Chongqing's electronic and telecommunications equipment (ETE) manufacturing industry, as this sector is a low-carbon industry promoted by the CRE. This study proposes a novel detour estimation strategy for causal identification of the environmental externality of CRE on carbon dioxide emissions. The results show that the CRE could contribute to an increase of 567.06 billion yuan in ETE exports from Chongqing to Europe and a consequent reduction of 17.10 million tons of carbon dioxide between 2011 and 2021. This study provides new insights into the environmental externality of CRE and the mechanism of manufacturing industry substitution effect, contributing to the understanding of the relationship between transportation and carbon dioxide emissions.</description>

      <title>Low-cost UAV Coordinated Carbon Observation Network: carbon dioxide measurement with multiple UAVs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2024.120609</link>

                Improving the mitigation of global greenhouse effects requires drastic reductions in carbon emissions. Effective carbon management at different spatial scales is therefore crucial to a more sustainable path of economic development. Regional and local carbon management currently rely on the traditional bottom-up method of emission reports, which are known for their opaque and complex procedures. Novel top-down carbon monitoring methods including space-based, aerial and ground-based observations are tantalising alternatives to more reliable data sources of carbon emissions as well as sinks. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) based carbon monitoring is an upcoming field because of its lower costs, higher spatial-temporal resolution and operability at a wider range of weather conditions compared to satellite observations. UAVs equipped with Non-dispersive Infrared (NDIR) carbon dioxide (CO2) sensors can measure in the air with faster response and can intelligently navigate themselves within areas of greater interest. With the help of lighter NDIR payloads and multiple UAVs flying in synchrony, larger cross sections or areas for maximising information acquisition of emission plumes can be covered. In this article, we first introduce the design of a miniaturised NDIR payload, which is compatible with a lightweight UAV to achieve a single system weighing less than 4kg. Then, we test our design via comparisons against another NDIR payload to determine its accuracy (-0.82ppm and -0.44ppm) and precision (0.12ppm and -0.03ppm) in measurements of two vertical concentration profiles. Finally, we deployed four UAVs on two major anthropogenic emission source monitoring campaigns with coordinated flight patterns. To fully understand the benefit of multi-UAV carbon monitoring, we attempted two flight patterns and computed power plant emission rates via the cross-sectional flux method. While all flights successfully captured the concentration enhancements downwind of the power plants, the single-sectional flight pattern measured an emission rate of 10ktCO2/day which is 44% less than that reported monthly and the multi-sectional flight pattern yielded relatively varied results (8.5ktCO2/day on average, which is 54% less) for the respective sections due to wind underestimations, plume section undersampling and wind fluctuations.</description>

                Along with the promotion of low-carbon and zero carbon buildings such as ultra-low energy buildings, near zero energy buildings, and zero energy buildings, there is higher and higher demand to the thermal performance of building envelopes. Thermal bridges have a crucial impact on the thermal performance of building envelope structures. In order to achieve the goal of energy conservation and carbon dioxide reduction in building structures, it is necessary to conduct refined calculations and evaluations on thermal bridge treatment measures. In this paper, three thermal bridge treatment measures evaluation methods from different dimensions are presented: evaluation method based on reduction degree of thermal bridge effect, evaluation method based on carbon dioxide emissions from thermal bridges, and evaluation method based on technical economy of thermal bridges.</description>

                Climate change, driven by escalating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, poses a significant threat to forest ecosystems and the livelihoods of communities reliant on them, especially for the global south countries and regions like the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe. The 2000 land redistribution programme reduced buffer zones between ecologically sensitive forests and land reform beneficiaries near major carbon reservoirs. In light of these challenges, this study aimed to assess the potential effects of climate change on a strategically important plantation forest ecosystem in Zimbabwe's eastern highlands. Using data from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), we modelled and predicted changes in forest carbon (C) stock density under different climate scenarios: current (1970&#8211;2000), SSP5&#8211;4.5, and SSP5&#8211;8.5. Employing a hierarchical Bayesian geostatistical approach, we compared the baseline scenario (1970&#8211;2000) with projected scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) for 2075 to estimate changes in forest carbon stock distribution. Our results indicated a decline in carbon stock concentration under future climate scenarios, reflecting the adverse impact of greenhouse gas emissions on forest growth. We found that the projected range of forest carbon stock under the RCP8.5 scenario for 2075 is notably lower (2&#8804;MgCha&#8722;1&#8804;44.9) than that of the baseline period (1970&#8211;2000) (1&#8804;MgCha&#8722;1&#8804;97), suggesting a substantial reduction in carbon storage. As the difference in posterior mean C stock (&#956;&#773;1&#8722;&#956;&#773;2), 52.1 MgCha-1 is well above zero, we deduce that the posterior mean C stock distribution of the projected future RCP8.5 2075 climate projection is indeed credibly different from the current (1970&#8211;2000) climate scenario. Additionally, there is a high probability (&gt;90%) that forest plantations will be adversely affected by the business-as-usual climate warming projection. Overall, our findings highlight the urgent need for climate change mitigation strategies, such as reforestation programs and careful selection of tree species for plantations, to safeguard forest ecosystems and the communities dependent on them. These insights are crucial for informing effective adaptation measures in the face of future climate uncertainties.</description>

      <description>Warju Warju, Sudirman Rizki Ariyanto, Muhammad Yandi Pratama, Jurnal Polimesin/Jurnal polimesin. 22(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399099332

                In this modern era, motor vehicles have brought significant changes in human life. Faster and more efficient mobility has increased connectivity between regions, supported economic growth, and improved quality of life. However, increased mobility also means an increase in vehicle exhaust emissions, which contribute to climate change and air pollution. One effective technology for controlling exhaust emissions is the use of catalytic converters. Metal catalytic converters, such as copper, brass, and chrome-plated copper, have been researched as more affordable and effective catalyst alternatives. This research aims to analyze the optimal design of exhaust systems with catalytic converters among three types of alternative materials (copper, brass, and chrome-plated copper) as well as standard exhaust systems without catalysts (STD NC) and standard platinum group metal exhaust systems (STD PGM) in maximizing the reduction of motor vehicle exhaust emissions. An experimental research design was used by utilizing a 2015 Yamaha Vixion Lightning as the research object. Catalytic converters were prepared with specific specifications to ensure consistency and accuracy in measurements. CO (carbon monoxide), HC (hydrocarbons), CO2 (carbon dioxide), and O2 (oxygen) emissions were analyzed using an Exhaust Gas Analyzer. The research results indicate that the CuCr sample exhibits excellent performance in reducing CO and HC emissions. The CuCr sample has an average CO emission of 4.09% Vol with a standard deviation of 1.46, demonstrating good consistency in CO emissions. Meanwhile, the average HC emissions from the CuCr sample are 320 ppmVol with a standard deviation of 106, indicating good consistency in HC emissions. All samples meet the emission standards set by the government, except for the STD NC sample, which exceeds the CO emission threshold.</description>

                The molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) operates at temperatures around 650 &#176;C and uses an electrolyte of molten alkali metal carbonates. The key electrochemical reaction at the cathode is the reduction of oxygen and reaction with carbon dioxide to form carbonate ions that are transported through the molten electrolyte and converted back to carbon dioxide at the anode. Since the earliest days of development, lithiated nickel oxide (NiO) has been the material of choice for the cathode. It meets all the essential needs of the MCFC cathode except for that it slowly dissolves in the electrolyte. Over time this may lead to cell degradation through precipitation of nickel in the electrolyte and subsequent internal short circuits. Dissolution of NiO is influenced by the composition of the electrolyte as well as the pressure of the oxygen and carbon dioxide at the cathode surface. Current commercial MCFC cells have already achieved &gt;7-year durability. Approaches to further enhance durability include alternative cathode and/or electrolyte materials, or simply by limiting the operating pressure/temperature.</description>

      <title>Research on the Measurement of the Relationship between Carbon Emissions and Economic Development in China&#8212;&#8212;Based on the Tapio Decoupling theory and the Environmental Kuznets Theory Analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202452803011</link>
      <description>Yuxin Chen, Yan Wang, E3S web of conferences. 528(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399072340

                In this paper, based on the panel data of China's carbon dioxide emissions, economic and energy development from 2000 to 2022, per capita GDP and carbon emissions are used as analysis indicators.The environmental Kuznets theory serves as the basis for an analysis of the correlation between economic progress and carbon dioxide emissions.The findings indicate that China's GDP and carbon emissions increased between 2000 and 2022. From 7,912 yuan in 2000 to 85,698 yuan in 2022, the per capita GDP grew by over ten times. Although per capita carbon emissions generally increased, they declined between 2014 and 2017, It might be connected to the nation's strong initiatives to support green development and the restructuring of the energy structure.For specific explanations,please refer to 4.1 Temporal evolution characteristics of carbon emissions and GDP . China is still in a transitional phase when it comes to environmental preservation and economic development, as seen by the N-shaped curve connecting the country's carbon dioxide emissions and economic growth rate. Based on this theory, the Tapio decoupling theory provides an understanding of the decoupling relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth based on carbon accounting. The irrational use of coal, oil, natural gas and other fossil fuels as the main energy has caused a series of environmental problems and seriously restricted economic development. Therefore, Stronger innovation and promotion of low-carbon and green technologies are required, as is the reduction of carbon emissions from the industrial structure and method of economic progress.</description>

      <title>Can the energy internet achieve carbon reduction?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fenrg.2024.1341542</link>
      <description>Yan Jun Li, Guiwen Wang, Long Yang, Yuting Deng, Beibei Shi, Nan Li, Rong Kang, Yating Yang, Tingting Yang, Frontiers in energy research. 12(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399189977

                Based on panel data for 30 provinces in China from 2000 to 2020, this paper uses entropy method to construct the integrated development indicators of energy Internet, and explores the impact of the development of the energy Internet on reducing carbon emissions in China and its internal transmission mechanism. The research results show that the development of energy Internet can significantly reduce regional carbon dioxide emissions, and increasing the use of renewable energy is an important mechanism for the comprehensive development of energy Internet to curb carbon emissions. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the emission reduction effect brought by the development of energy Internet is more remarkable in the regions with lower carbon emissions and western China. Furthermore, this paper finds that in the setting of the development of energy Internet, the development of renewable energy can promote natural gas consumption and advance energy conversion efficiency. The government&#8217;s emphasis on regional technology development has an external strengthening effect on carbon emission reduction. The research in this paper expands and diversifies carbon reduction pathways and provides reference for more developing countries to utilize the development of energy internet to achieve carbon reduction.</description>

      <title>Study of lime flow rate on calcium looping carbon capture for steel plant</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/03019233241251598</link>
      <description>Chayut Sungsook, Thongchai Rohitatisha Srinophakun, Ironmaking &amp; steelmaking. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399050252

                Calcium looping carbon capture was simulated for a steel plant and three fuel cases were studied: coal, coke, and half coal/coke. The steelmaking production was about 1.2 t of liquid steel per hour at &gt;99.85% purity by weight. This study evaluated the effect of carbon capture efficiency and raw material cost on the lime flow rate in the calcium looping section. Increasing the lime feeding flow rate achieved higher efficiency but at a higher cost. The overall captured efficiency was higher than the flue gas captured efficiency at a low lime feeding flow rate but lower at a high lime feeding flow rate. Then, the overall captured efficiency tended to decrease at high lime feeding flow rate because raw materials were used too much for carbon capture and caused overall carbon dioxide emission more than the content of captured carbon dioxide in the product stream. Coal as fuel plays an important role in carbon emission reduction as one of the raw materials, along with the utility cost and the raw material cost in calcium looping section.</description>

                This study aimed to examine the actual effects of policies by applying a quasi-experimental methodology to the second phase of China&#8217;s low-carbon pilot city project. Particularly, we tried to investigate whether a significant reduction in particulate matter and carbon emissions occurred through the implementation of the policy. Analyzing 31 cities in China from 2008 to 2018, the study revealed a significant decrease in both particulate matter and carbon dioxide emissions in the pilot cities compared to non-pilot cities post-policy implementation. Further categorization of cities into groups based on a GDP of over 90,000 yuan and cities with a secondary industry contribution exceeding 50% indicated that the pilot city initiatives had the most substantial effects in these areas. Additionally, deriving insights from the analysis of factors influencing particulate matter and carbon emissions, the study drew policy implications. These findings underscore the significant practical impact of municipally-led, city-specific approaches in China&#8217;s environmental policies.</description>

                Reducing carbon dioxide emissions has become a prominent issue in city construction. Here, with the objective of spatial pattern optimization, we propose a comprehensive evaluation framework for low-carbon cities. To shed further light on the mechanism by which green finance facilitates the low-carbon transformation of the economy, we chose Xi'an as a study area, used the system dynamics model, simulated the relationship between different factors in the development of low-carbon cities, and provided guidance for spatial planning of low-carbon cities. Through systematic analysis of results, we found that with the progress of urbanization and the improvement of people's living standards, the carbon emissions from urban buildings in Xi'an will increase annually and reach 2.47 million tons by 2030. In scenario 1, the faster pace of urbanization raises carbon emissions from urban buildings by 3%, to 2.5543 million tons from the base. In contrast, in Scenario 2, the reduction in urbanization rate results in a decrease in urban building carbon emissions to 2.4243 million tons, a reduction of 2.26% compared to the baseline scenario. Thus it can be seen that diverse modifications of parameters exert distinct effects on the ultimate carbon emissions from urban buildings.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Environmental, Economic, and Route Optimization Impacts of Implementing a Green Bus System in Urban Areas</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.22158/asir.v8n2p102</link>
      <description>Yang Pan, Yukun Zheng, Zixi Wang, Yaqing Yang, Applied science and innovative research. 8(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399131956

                The proliferation of e-bus has swept the globe. Many countries have begun the transformation of electric buses. Electric buses are embraced worldwide for their environmental and low-cost advantages. This work will help local governments establish a complete e-bus system.The first question mainly addresses the ecological impact that would be brought by the impact. In this work, the Ecological Impact Quantification Model (EIQM) is developed to address gaseous pollution including Greenhouse gas carbon dioxide, pollutants nitric oxide and PM2.5. The ecological effect enhancement with e-bus system is presented, and especially, the gaseous pollution caused by electricity production is approximated by the Monte Carlo simulation method. As a result, this team figures out that with the development of e-bus system, the average CO2 emission per person decreases, having a reduction of 11391g at first, and 14039g after five years.The second question mainly addresses the financial problem that the government needs to face. In this work, the Quantification of Financial Impact Model (QFIM) is developed. This team utilizes the differential equation to obtain the exact varying rate of diesel fuel and electricity fee, and finally determined the possible range of the government deficit. By synthesizing these data, this team discovers that the government could start reducing its deficit after 8 years of the transformation from diesel bus to e-bus, having deficit from $-88,412,180 to $-64,182,722.The third question addresses the 10-year plan for the selected city and 2 additional cities. This team develops Optimized Deployment Model based on Greedy Algorithm (ODGA) to optimize the transformation plan over 10 years of existing bus routes and the number of e-bus to be constructed per year. Monetary and time utility is considered and Greedy Algorithm is introduced to find out the best travelling route for e-buses. This team successfully figures out the best transformation plan of travelling routes and number of e-bus to be constructed per year to maximize the efficiency, including 5-min interval departure time and 867 buses are required to run the proposed route in Chicago. Finally, the team writes a piece of letter to Chicago Transit Authority and proposes the 10-year plan of e-bus system construction to guarantee the steady implementation of e-bus.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Caprock Integrity and Fault Reactivity for the First China Offshore Ccs Hub Operation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4848476</link>
      <description>Guangyu Shi, Lintao Li, Shaokong Feng, Jianrong Lu, Yanzun Li, Shidong Li, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399178800

                Since the Paris Agreement, the world has reached a consensus that CCS/CCUS technology is the most efficient and priority choice to achieve carbon reduction, emission reduction, and temperature control after extensive explorations to fulfill their commitments. China faces a natural contradiction in its carbon dioxide sequestration efforts while the eastern part of the country is rich in carbon sources but lacks geological storage capacity. Therefore, making use of marine sedimentary basins for offshore CCS/CCUS becomes an inevitable choice to achieve China's "dual carbon" goal. In pursuit of this goal, CNOOC Limited has conducted a series of explorations and practices and launched China's first offshore CCS/CCUS industrial cluster project. Through preliminary research on this project, we realized that China's offshore basins generally exhibit strong structural activity, poor reservoir or caprock distribution continuity, and extensive fault development compared to onshore storage sites and foreign typical offshore CCS projects. As such, evaluating caprock integrity and fault reactivity becomes crucial in monitoring the risk associated with offshore CCS. Here, to address these challenges, a reactive transport modeling with a geomechanics module was employed to examine caprock integrity and fault reactivity at the first China offshore CCS Hub operation using a geological model constructed from near-site existing well logging and seismic data. The results from the model demonstrate that caprock integrity and fault reactivity at this offshore CCS site are safe and stable under injectivity scales of 2 Mt., 5 Mt., and 10 Mt. during the operational period.</description>

      <title>Direct use of low-concentration CO2 in the synthesis of dialkyl carbonates, carbamate acid esters, and urea derivatives</title>

                The CO2 in thermal power plant and factory exhaust gases and the air must be addressed because all have low-concentration CO2. However, applying low-concentration CO2 to developed reactions that use high-purity CO2, energy- and cost-intensive pretreatments, such as CO2 purification, concentration, and compression, are required. Thus, a technology that directly converts low-concentration CO2 into useful chemicals without these pretreatment processes is attractive for energy saving and cost reduction. Such technology has been achieved in the fields of methane and methanol synthesis via the hydrogen reduction of CO2. Recently, the concept of directly using low-concentration CO2 has been applied to the synthesis of high value-added chemicals without hydrogen reduction. The synthesis of useful chemicals from CO2 without hydrogen reduction is a technology that will be put into practical use without waiting for the widespread use of green hydrogen. Thus, this review introduces the technology for the direct synthesis of useful chemicals, such as dialkyl carbonates (DRCs), carbamic acid esters (CAEs), and urea derivatives from low-concentration CO2 contained in exhaust gas or air, without hydrogen reduction. DRCs, CAEs, and urea derivatives are synthesized via the non-hydrogen reduction route of CO2. They are expected to contribute to long-term, large-volume CO2 fixation because they are raw materials of functional polymers, which have long-material-life and large market potential. Details on how to synthesize these compounds directly from low-concentration CO2 are presented, focusing on the efforts to devise CO2 capture processes, reactants, and catalysts.</description>

      <title>Change of burden layer reduction process after injecting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into the tuyere of a blast furnace</title>

                In order to expand the utilisation of CO2 as a resource in the metallurgical industry, it is proposed to inject CO2 into the tuyere of blast furnace. CO2 reacts completely at the tuyere raceway zone, increasing the CO concentration of the gas, affects the reduction process. Therefore, the influence of injecting CO2 into the tuyere on the reduction process of the burden layer is analysed through a series of experiments. The results indicate that when the CO2 injection rate increases to 4%, the improvement of the permeability is most significant, which is due to the increase of the metal phase dispersion in the burden layer. The influence of injecting CO2 on the burden layer distribution mainly comes from the influence of the experimental atmosphere on the reduction degree. With the increase of the CO2 injection rate, the low temperature reduction pulverisation behavior of burden layer changes less.</description>

                A nanocomposite of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) decorated with molybdenum dioxide (MoO2) nanoparticles is fabricated through the reduction of phosphomolybdic acid hydrate on functionalized MWCNTs in a hydrogen&#8211;argon (10%) atmosphere in a tube furnace. The MoO2/MWCNTs composite is proposed as an anodic modification material for microbial fuel cells (MFCs). MWCNTs have outstanding physical and chemical peculiarities, with functionalized MWCNTs having substantially large electroactive areas. In addition, combined with the exceptional properties of MoO2 nanoparticles, the synergistic advantages of functionalized MWCNTs and MoO2 nanoparticles give a MoO2/MWCNTs anode a large electroactive area, excellent electronic conductivity, enhanced extracellular electron transfer capacity, and improved nutrient transfer capability. Finally, the power harvesting of an MFC with the MoO2/MWCNTs anode is improved, with the MFC showing long-term repeatability of voltage and current density outputs. This exploratory research advances the fundamental application of anodic modification to MFCs, simultaneously providing valuable guidance for the use of carbon-based transition metal oxide nanomaterials in high-performance MFCs.</description>

      <title>Carbon Farming: a Systematic Literature Review on Sustainable Practices</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.7250/conect.2024.063</link>
      <description>Lelde Vistarte, Anna Kubule, Je&#316;ena Pubule, CONECT. International Scientific Conference of Environmental and Climate Technologies. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399067686

                The European Union (EU) aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030. As the goal for 2030 is already set and now it is challenging to reach a 55% reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the goals will become more challenging as the EU plans to reach climate neutrality by 2050. As the EU&#8217;s Climate goals become more ambitious the countries have to adapt and find more potential ways to decrease GHG emissions in all sectors. One of the biggest contributors to GHG in the EU is the agricultural sector. One of the potential ways to reduce GHG emissions in the agricultural sector is carbon farming. Carbon farming is a sustainable agricultural approach designed to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and mitigate climate change. By employing regenerative practices, carbon farming enhances soil health, promotes biodiversity, and reduces GHG emissions. Carbon farming emerges as a key player in the global effort to combat climate change. The integration of carbon farming practices into agriculture not only can ensure sustainable food production but also underscore the critical role agriculture can play in sequestering carbon and building resilience against the challenges posed by a changing climate. Even though carbon farming has the potential to decrease GHG emissions from the agricultural sector and sequester carbon, there are still knowledge gaps on how to assess carbon farming practices and their potential carbon sequestration, as well as which practices the farmers could use to gain the best possible outcome based on the carbon practice feasibility and sustainability. The study aims to develop a systematic literature review that assesses the main carbon farming practices and their potential to help reach climate goals and contribute to climate change mitigation.</description>

                With the increase of carbon dioxide concentration, global warming has become increasingly serious, and has posed a serious threat to human survival and the ecological environment. The land use carbon emissions (LUCE) are only second to those caused by fossil fuel combustion. The affected area of the lower Yellow River (ALYR) is an essential grain producing area in China. Studying its LUCE and future development has practical significance for the low-carbon development and food security of the basin. We analyzed the characteristics and drivers of LUCE in the ALYR from 2000 &#8722; 2018 and simulated the LUCE under different scenarios in 2030. The LUCE in the ALYR were in a continuous growth trend, with a growth rate of 27.94%, and the economic efficiency and ecological carrying capacity remained stable. The built-up land area and the proportion of secondary industry in GDP can promote the LUCE, while the per capita GDP has a suppressive effect. The LUCE will decrease in 2030, with the least LUCE under the cultivated land protection scenario. The results show that it is necessary to control the built-up land and increase the area of ecological land in order to achieve carbon emission reduction. This study analyzed the LUCE in the ALYR from the different periods, providing a theoretical reference for promoting sustainable development of the basin and scientific land use management.</description>

                Abstract Copper (Cu) nanomaterials are a unique kind of electrocatalysts for high&#8208;value multi&#8208;carbon production in carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO 2 RR), which holds enormous potential in attaining carbon neutrality. However, phase engineering of Cu nanomaterials remains challenging, especially for the construction of unconventional phase Cu&#8208;based asymmetric heteronanostructures. Here we report the site&#8208;selective growth of Cu on unusual phase gold (Au) nanorods, obtaining three kinds of heterophase fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8208;Cu heteronanostructures. Significantly, the resultant fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8208;Cu Janus nanostructures (JNSs) break the symmetric growth mode of Cu on Au. In electrocatalytic CO 2 RR, the fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Au&#8208;Cu JNSs exhibit excellent performance in both H&#8208;type and flow cells, with Faradaic efficiencies of 55.5% and 84.3% for ethylene and multi&#8208;carbon products, respectively. In&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal the co&#8208;exposure of 2H&#8208;Au and 2H&#8208;Cu domains in Au&#8208;Cu JNSs diversifies the CO* adsorption configurations and promotes the CO* spillover and subsequent C&#8208;C coupling towards ethylene generation with reduced energy barriers.

                Summary A massive and rapid reduction of carbon dioxide emissions is required to effectively address climate change and comply with international agreements. CCS technologies have been successfully applied and can actively contribute to this goal. By interpreting 2D and 3D seismic and well data, a regional model of the Bunter Sandstone Formation in the Southern North Sea has been built to investigate the feasibility of basin-scale carbon storage. Furthermore, parameters that affect long-term plume migration in saline aquifers have been studied. This comprehensive analysis of static modelling and reservoir simulation has shown that migration naturally occurs over decades and centuries, with distinct patterns during and after injection phases. Consequently, plume evolution is influenced by reservoir heterogeneities, connectivity, and top structure shapes, which also help increase trapping mechanisms. Moreover, existing pressure gradients stimulate hydrodynamic fluxes affecting the whole region, allowing long-term migration and containment efficiency. The complex interplay of these elements underscores the need for a deep, large-scale understanding of geological storage, but not limited to the operational time, which can potentially drive innovative strategies for expanding geological carbon storage in similar saline aquifers.</description>

                The gas sensors were prepared using carbon quantum dots (CQDs) using an electrochemical method after mixing the CQDs with Tris (8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (III) (Alq3) polymer. A spin coating technique was used to deposit CQDs/Alq3 composite film on glass substrates with a ratio of 1:1. The CQDs/Alq3 gas sensor showed a sensitivity of about 24&#1642; at a temperature of 300 &#8451;, and this was calculated after measuring the change in the resistance of the samples with a response time of 2 and 8sec recovery time. The sensor showed a good response for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) gas. However, the sensitivity, response time, and recovery time for the CQDs gas sensor when exposed to NO2 gas at 300 &#176;C were 78%, 4s, and 129s, respectively. The results showed that the best sensor CQDs/Alq3 led to a reduction in the recovery time, which shows the importance of the Alq3 polymer in improving the properties of the gas sensor.</description>

                Abstract A sealed reciprocating tribometer has been used to study the influence of different gaseous environments on the friction and wear properties of AISI52100 bearing steel at atmospheric pressure and 25&#176;C. Helium, argon, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen all give high friction and wear, suggestive of very little, if any tribofilm formation under the conditions studied. Dry air and oxygen also give high friction, slightly lower than the inert gases, but produce extremely high wear, much higher than the inert gases. This is characteristic of the phenomenon of &#8220;oxidational wear&#8221;. The two gases ammonia and carbon monoxide give relatively low friction and wear, and XPS analysis indicates that this is due to the formation of adsorbed ammonia/nitride and carbonate films respectively. For the hydrocarbon gases studied, two factors appear to control friction and wear, degree of unsaturation and molecular weight. For the saturated hydrocarbons, methane and ethane give high friction and wear but propane and butane give low friction after a period of rubbing that decreases with molecular weight. The unsaturated hydrocarbons all give an immediate reduction in friction with correspondingly low wear. Raman analysis shows that all the hydrocarbons that reduce friction and wear form a carbonaceous tribofilm of the rubbed surfaces.</description>

      <title>Simulation Study on Static Sealing Performance of Packer&#8217;s Rubber Cylinder in SC-CO2 Environment</title>

                This study aimed to solve the problems of sealing and tearing failure of packer&#8217;s rubber cylinders during CO2 downhole injection. Using the simulation software, Comsol, a rubber cylinder model in a supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) environment was established. The thermal analogy method was used to simulate the CO2 diffusion and rubber cylinder swelling process, thus we analyzed the deformation and stress of the rubber cylinder caused by temperature, pressure and CO2 as swelling agent. Results showed that, in the SC-CO2 environment, under the influence of CO2 diffusion and the consequent swelling, the rubber cylinder body is prone to large deformation, and the maximum shear stress is significantly increased, leading to shear failure of the rubber cylinder. The reduction of the initial seating pressure can alleviate the impact of deformation, whereas the reduction of the maximum contact pressure could cause the rubber cylinder to lose its seal. We also analyzed the change rules between various factors and the maximum contact pressure of the rubber cylinder, which provides a theoretical basis and technical support for improving the sealing performance of the packer&#8217;s rubber cylinder in the SC-CO2 environment.</description>

                The O 2 -CO 2 -CaO process, which blows the lime powder from the bottom, offers significant advantages in terms of reducing the consumption of raw and auxiliary materials while improving steel quality. This study examines the carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions associated with four different converter smelting processes, using industrial test production data from nearly 1000 furnaces in a steel plant. This is the first comprehensive analysis of CO 2 emissions for these processes and quantifies the CO 2 emissions reduction potential of the bottom-blowing O 2 -CO 2 -CaO process. The study shows a significant difference in CO 2 emissions between the duplex and conventional smelting processes, with the former exhibiting significantly higher emissions. The application of bottom-blowing O 2 -CO 2 -CaO process led to a decrease of 24.6 kgCO 2 /t in the duplex converter smelting process and 30.1 kgCO 2 /t in the conventional smelting process.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic Model of District Heating Energy Hub: The Case of Latvia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.7250/conect.2024.017</link>
      <description>Emils Zarins, Madara Rieksta, Gatis Ba&#382;bauers, CONECT. International Scientific Conference of Environmental and Climate Technologies. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399067529

                Up to 60% of Latvia&#8217;s energy resources are used as fuel for district heating systems. Heating sector is an important emitter of greenhouse gases &#8211; especially carbon dioxide. Therefore, reduction of carbon emissions of district heating systems are crucial in Latvia&#8217;s decarbonization efforts. One of the solutions is integration of energy hub in the district heating network. There are many types of energy hubs, and the most suitable solution must be found in each case. A goal of this study is to find the best solution for Latvia&#8217;s district heating systems to achieve decarbonization and use of green (renewable) hydrogen. This coincides with European Union&#8217;s plans to increase the use of green hydrogen not only in industrial and residential application, but in heat production as well.To facilitate the plans of the European Union and Latvia&#8217;s decarbonization needs a mathematical model made in Microsoft Excel is used as a method to explore the techno-economic aspects of the energy hub and its integration in the district heating system. Several alternatives are considered, and green hydrogen is used in all of those. Results show the economically most feasible alternative. Calculations are made on an annual term basis, considering such factors as electricity and district heating price, required capacity of electrolysis apparatus for hydrogen production etc.From the model some results are apparent &#8211; the price of electricity has a sizable impact on the economic feasibility of the project, and the best use for green hydrogen economics-wise may differ throughout the year as the price of electricity, hydrogen, district heating and methane gas change.</description>

                Abstract Background Catalyst synthesis plays a crucial role in advancing photo and electrocatalysis technologies for sustainable development. However, the traditional thermal radiation heating method suffers from the disadvantages of high energy consumption, low heat transfer efficiency, slow heating speed and long heating time, which leads to the inefficiency and cost increases in catalyst preparation. Aims The Joule&#8208;heating ultrafast synthesis method with rapid heating/quenching and shorter heating time has attracted much attention. Despite its potential, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews specifically addressing the synthesis of advanced photo and electrocatalysts via Joule&#8208;heating. Therefore, this review aims to help people quickly understand the advantages of Joule&#8208;heating in the synthesis of photo and electrocatalysts. Discussion Herein, we firstly introduce the principles and devices of Joule&#8208;heating, and then we discuss breakthroughs in defect modulation, heterojunction construction, single&#8208;atom catalysts, bimetallic alloy catalysts, high&#8208;entropy alloy catalysts and metastable catalysts achieved through Joule&#8208;heating technology. The diverse applications of these catalysts include hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction reactions, carbon dioxide reduction reactions, nitrogen reduction reaction and degradation of organic pollutants. Furthermore, this review provides a forward&#8208;looking perspective on future directions for employing Joule&#8208;heating methods in the field of photo and electrocatalysis research. Conclusion This review highlights the pivotal role played by Joule&#8208;heating techniques in advancing nanomaterial synthesis as well as developing sustainable high&#8208;performance catalyst systems.</description>

      <title>Observed regional impacts of marine heatwaves on air-sea CO2 exchange</title>

                Marine heatwaves (MHWs) have devastating effects on ecosystems and impact regional air-sea CO2 exchange. Yet a global assessment of these regional impacts of MHWs on the air-sea CO2 exchange is missing. Here, we analyze thirty global observation-based air-sea CO2 flux datasets from 1990 to 2019. We observe minimal reduction in global oceanic CO2 uptake during MHWs. Regional variations are evident with the equatorial Pacific experiencing a 31% (spread across datasets: 3-49%) reduction in carbon release, suggesting that MHWs are the dominant drivers of strong air-sea CO2 flux anomalies in this region. In low-to-mid latitudes, MHWs cause a 29% (19-37%) decrease in air-sea CO2 uptake. Reduced dissolved inorganic carbon in the tropics weakens outgassing, while high ocean temperatures diminish uptake in the low-to-mid latitudes. In the North Pacific and Southern Ocean, enhanced carbon uptake occurs during MHWs, but uncertainties in pCO2 datasets limit a comprehensive assessment in these regions.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Framework for Multistep Carbon Emission Prediction: An Improved Bi-LSTM Model Based on the Bayesian Optimization Algorithm and Two-Stage Decomposition</title>

                Abstract Effective prediction of carbon dioxide emissions is crucial for the real-time monitoring of carbon emission dynamics and the formulation of emission reduction policies. For the accurate and stable prediction of carbon emission data, multiple challenges must be addressed, mainly including nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and dynamic uncertainty. To further improve the accuracy of carbon emission prediction, an ensemble framework for daily CO&#8322; emission forecasting based on data decomposition-reconstruction is proposed. First, the original data are decomposed into trend, seasonal, and residual components using seasonal trend decomposition via the Loess method. For the trend and seasonal components, the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) is applied to optimize a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network for further prediction. The Bi-LSTM adopts a novel LeakyReLU activation function to effectively extract data features, thereby enhancing the model's expressive power. Meanwhile, the Nadam optimizer is employed, which combines the adaptive learning rate mechanism of the Adam algorithm with the Nesterov momentum to update weights and biases, enabling efficient model training, accelerating convergence, and improving model performance. Then, the residual component is decomposed again using gray wolf optimizer (GWO)-optimized variational mode decomposition (VMD), VMD incorporates a quadratic penalty function and Lagrange multipliers to derive the input series. and the decomposed subsequences are predicted using gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks. Finally, the predictions of each subsequence are stacked and reconstructed to obtain the final forecast value, creating an ensemble framework referred to as STL-BOA-Bi-LSTM-GWO-VMD-GRU. The proposed ensemble framework is tested on real data from seven different regions. In both single-step and multistep prediction processes, the proposed ensemble framework has higher prediction accuracy and stability than other models, demonstrating significant advantages.</description>

                Summary In this paper, we investigate microbial representatives from the worldwide first pilot project on hydrogen storage and in-situ methanation conducted in the Lehen Gasfield in Upper Austria. A microfluidic approach was used to investigate biomass accumulation in the pore space. Particular attention was paid to the growth and detachment mechanisms and the resulting microscopic structure formation, which was imaged with high spatial and temporal resolution. By combining microfluidic experiments with direct numerical simulations on digital twins, the influence of biomass accumulation on the hydraulic properties was quantified, including the intrinsic biomass permeability. A decisive factor for the nutrient supply of the biomass and, thus, the gas conversion rate. The quantification of the relationship between permeability and porosity reduction provides a deep insight into the general hydraulic conductivity of the altered system. The study compares the microbial consortium extracted from the Lehen field and M. formicicum, an extracted active species of the consortium. The experiments were carried out under saturated flow conditions, with the nutrient gas hydrogen and carbon dioxide dissolved in the aqueous phase. This represents a limiting case of a completely mobile aqueous phase, in contrast to the other limiting case of immobile connate water saturation.</description>

      <title>Co-Abatement of Greenhouse Gas And Air Pollutants Emissions in China's Megacity, Shanghai: High-Precision Spatial Hotspots Identification, Effect Assessment and Policy Implication</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4849389</link>

                Driving co-abatement of Greenhouse Gas (GHGs) and Air Pollutants (APs) in the city level is crucial for fostering societal green and low-carbon transitions, yet comprehensive and refined researches at this level remain limited. To facilitate subtle and precise urban management of GHGs control and APs reduction, this study targeted almost all anthropogenic emission sources in Shanghai, a typical megacity of China, analyzing the co-benefits of GHGs and APs via emissions flow, spatial distribution, hotspot identification, and scenario prediction. Results highlighted the source heterogeneity of different species and significant contributions of energy consumption. CO2 emissions showed a strong spatial correlation with SO2, NOx, and CO, followed by VOCs and PM. Hotspots for co-abatement included power plants, steel enterprises, petrochemical enterprises and chemical industrial parks in coastal areas, and airports. Achieving positive co-benefits in industrial sector would depend on the steady decline of CO2 emissions in power generation and steel industries. Introducing carbon capture devices and improving energy efficiency would be more conducive to CO2 emission reduction, while energy cleaning and elimination of backwardness are more effective in reducing APs. These mitigation measures could achieve 68.8% and 47.6% reduction for CO2 and APs by 2050, respectively.</description>

                To construct an evaluation framework based on whole-life energy consumption and pollution emissions, the control variable method is used when selecting vehicles for comparison. By assessing a new energy vehicle (the Audi Q2L e-tron) and a traditional fuel vehicle (the Audi Q2L) of the same model, differences in emission and energy consumption are solely attributed to power forms. Results are monetized to facilitate analysis of the societal benefits of new energy vehicles, reflecting environmental impact in monetary terms. The results of the paper show that although the replacement of traditional fuel vehicles by new energy vehicles can achieve carbon emission reduction and considerable energy savings in the energy cycle, due to the fact that new energy vehicles produce more sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ) in the production phase, the full replacement of traditional fuel vehicles by electric vehicles at this stage will not be able to achieve an improvement in the overall welfare of the society. Therefore, under the current conditions, the improvement of new energy vehicles should start with finding cleaner and more environmentally friendly ways in the manufacturing stage of automobiles, as well as modifying the way of producing electricity.</description>

      <title>Governance of carbon dioxide removal (CDR): an AI-enhanced systematic map of the scientific literature</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4484969/v1</link>

                Abstract For limiting global warming to well below 2&#176;C rapid and stringent GHG emissions reductions are required. In addition, we also need to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere via carbon dioxide removal (CDR). This will require advances in policymaking and governance to incentivise, coordinate and regulate CDR, including strict monitoring to ensure durable, additional removals that do not compete with emission reduction efforts. While it is critical to learn from the existing evidence on CDR policy and governance, there is no overview of this dispersed body of literature right now. IPCC and other science assessments have therefore treated the subject very selectively. This work addresses this lack of overview by systematically mapping the literature assessing policy and governance dimensions of CDR. Systematic mapping provides a comprehensive view of a research field by analysing the state of evidence, i.e. how much research is available at any point in time on which topics and geographies studied by whom, when and where. We use an AI-enhanced approach to systematic mapping, trimming down an initial set of about 30,000 documents on CDR to a set of 876 that deal with governance and policy issues. Our findings show sharply growing attention to CDR policies and governance issues over time, but with limited coverage of the Global South. Long established conventional CDR methods such as afforestation dominate the literature - particularly in ex-post studies - with little coverage of many novel CDR methods, such as biochar or direct air carbon capture and storage. We observe a shift from an initial discussion on CDR in international agreements towards the planning and implementation phase of national and sub-national policies. Our map can help to inform upcoming science assessments with critical information around CDR policies and governance and might serve as a starting point for generating a rigorous knowledge base on the topic in the future.</description>

                The challenge of reconciling economic development with environmental sustainability amidst resource constraints poses a significant dilemma for governments. This dilemma often necessitates difficult choices between prioritizing economic growth or environmental protection. Despite the growing body of literature on economic growth, CO2 emissions, and related topics, certain critical factors such as innovation and political institutions remain understudied, despite their profound impacts on CO2 emissions and environmental degradation. Moreover, existing literature on these subjects is either limited or contradictory. Therefore, this study explores the influence of political institutions, economic growth, FDI inflows, and innovation on CO2 emissions. Additionally, it seeks to ascertain the validity of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) and pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) in selected developing economies, particularly in light of political institutions. Employing panel ARDL methodology, this study aims to provide both short-run and long-run estimates. The findings of this study affirm the EKC hypothesis in selected developing economies while presenting conflicting evidence regarding the existence of the PHH. Furthermore, the study highlights the positive impact of innovation and energy consumption on CO2 emissions, contrasting with the negative correlation between population density, human capital, and CO2 emissions. Notably, it suggests that tackling corruption can lead to pollution reduction, increased government effectiveness can mitigate CO2 emissions, and enhanced political stability can enhance environmental quality. Moreover, the rule of law is found to positively influence CO2 emissions. Thus, the study concludes that robust anti-corruption measures and governance regulations are essential for pollution reduction and environmental quality improvement, while greater adherence to the rule of law fosters economic development alongside reduced CO2 emissions. Overall, this research contributes significantly to understanding the role and significance of political institutions in shaping economic growth, FDI inflows, innovation, and CO2 emissions across a broader spectrum of developing nations.</description>

      <title>Waste-Heat Renewable Gasifier Design through Taguchi's Method and MANFIS</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.7250/conect.2024.042</link>
      <description>Chung-Neng Huang, Yu&#8208;Shu Yen, CONECT. International Scientific Conference of Environmental and Climate Technologies. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399067525

                Ensuring a global average temperature increase of no more than 1.5&#176;C is crucial for aligning with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that a 45% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 or a 25% reduction by the same year is necessary to cap the temperature rise at 2&#176;C. Failure to achieve this target by 2030 would necessitate substantial subsequent reductions to compensate for the delayed progress toward net zero emissions, potentially incurring higher costs. Elevating the focus on enhancing energy efficiency has emerged as a key strategy in expediting progress toward these climate goals. Hydrogen, renowned for its high efficiency and emission-free combustion, is anticipated to play a pivotal role in this endeavor. Traditionally, gasifiers have served as the conduit for transforming inexpensive fuels like coal or biomass into hydrogen. However, their energy-intensive nature poses a challenge.Addressing this inherent issue, an innovative approach known as the external-heating gasifier has been proposed and designed. The design of the external-heating gasifier represents a quintessential nonlinear and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) problem. To achieve optimal performance, the integration of Taguchi's method and inverse-model technology has been employed, with a simulation platform developed using the COMSOL Multiphysics software.Initially, Taguchi's method was utilized to determine the minimum number of experiments required for a full-factorial design and identify the most critical factors influencing product performance. Subsequently, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was developed with a MIMO&#8211;ANFIS architecture. This system was employed to train an inverse model, facilitating the mapping of relationships between each input and output set. In essence, this approach enables the identification of manufacturing parameters that result in optimal performance. To illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method, a simulation study on an existing gasifier is presented.</description>

      <title>Strategic Innovation and Performance of Hydrogen Fuel Consumption in Kenya</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.36349/easjebm.2024.v07i05.006</link>
      <description>Richard Mbalya, Justice Mutua, East African scholars journal of economics, business and management. 7(05)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399160436

                The utilization of hydrogen fuel represents a global shift towards sustainable energy sources, yielding significant reductions in carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the abundance of renewable energy options, widespread adoption has been slow, with persistent reliance on fossil fuels. The purpose of this study was to establish the effect of strategic innovation on the performance of hydrogen fuel consumption in Kenya. The proposed objectives of this study were: to determine the effect of product innovation on the performance of hydrogen fuel consumption in Kenya, and to assess the influence of process innovation on the performance of hydrogen fuel consumption in Kenya. Employing a desktop research methodology, the study emphasizes the pivotal role of strategic innovations in fostering sustainability, product and process innovation in hydrogen fuel consumption and the renewable energy sector. This study concludes that strategic innovations, including product innovation and process innovation have a positive effect on the performance of hydrogen fuel consumption in Kenya. Further, robust policy frameworks are essential to incentivize and facilitate innovation in hydrogen fuel production. The study recommends that the Kenyan government prioritize policy formulation to stimulate hydrogen generation and utilization, integrating incentives for research and development, tax exemptions, and financial support to encourage private investment and domestic industry growth, thus reducing reliance on imports and fostering economic diversification.</description>

      <title>Exploring Sustainable Planning Strategies for Carbon Emission Reduction in Beijing&#8217;s Transportation Sector: A Multi-Scenario Carbon Peak Analysis Using the Extended STIRPAT Model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114670</link>
      <description>Yuhao Yang, Ruibin Dong, Xiaoyan Ren, Mengze Fu, Sustainability. 16(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399172387

                The transportation sector plays a pivotal role in China&#8217;s efforts to achieve CO2 reduction targets. As the capital of China, Beijing has the responsibility to lead the era&#8217;s demand for low-carbon development and provide replicable and scalable low-carbon transportation development experience and knowledge for other cities in China. This study calculates the CO2 emissions of the transportation sector in Beijing from 1999 to 2019, constructs an extended STIRPAT model (population, affluence, technology, and efficiency), employs ridge regression to mitigate the effects of multicollinearity among the eight indicators, reveals the extent and direction of influence exerted by different indicators on CO2 emissions, and predicts the development trends, peak times, and quantities of transportation CO2 emissions in nine scenarios for Beijing from 2021 to 2035. Finally, adaptive low-carbon planning strategies are proposed for Beijing pertaining to population size and structure, industrial layout optimization, urban functional reorganization and adjustment, transportation infrastructure allocation, technological research and promotion, energy transition planning, and regional collaborative development. The results are as follows: (1) The total amount of CO2 emissions from Beijing&#8217;s transportation sector exhibits a trend of gradually stabilizing in terms of growth, with a corresponding gradual deceleration in the rate of increase. Kerosene, gasoline, and diesel are the main sources of transportation CO2 emissions in Beijing, with an annual average proportion of 95.78%. (2) The degree of influence of the indicators on transportation CO2 emissions, in descending order, is energy intensity, per capita GDP, population size, GDP by transportation sector, total transportation turnover, public transportation efficiency, possession of private vehicles, and clean energy structure. Among them, the proportion of clean energy structure and public transportation efficiency are negatively correlated with transportation CO2 emissions, while the remaining indicators are positively correlated. (3) In the nine predicted scenarios, all scenarios, except scenario 2 and scenario 4, can achieve CO2 emission peaks by 2030, while scenarios 7 and 9 can reach the peak as early as 2025. (4) The significant advancement and application of green carbon reduction technologies have profound implications, as they can effectively offset the impacts of population, economy, and efficiency indicators under extensive development. Effective population control, sustainable economic development, and transportation efficiency improvement are viable means to help achieve carbon peaking and peak value in the transportation sector.</description>

      <title>Mechanical, Durability, and Microstructure Assessment of Wastepaper Fiber-Reinforced Concrete Containing Metakaolin</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17112608</link>
      <description>Mohammad Valizadeh Kiamahalleh, Aliakbar Gholampour, Mohsen Rezaei Shahmirzadi, Tuan Ngo, Togay Ozbakkaloglu, Materials. 17(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399074461

                This study evaluates the potential use of discarded plasterboard paper as fibers from buildings to reinforce concrete. Various concentrations of wastepaper fibers (0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, and 2.5% by weight of the binder) were investigated in this research. To mitigate the water absorption effect of the paper fibers, metakaolin was employed as a partial cement replacement. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of the wastepaper fiber enhances the mechanical and durability performance of the concrete. The optimal fiber proportion was identified as 1%, leading to a 29% increase in the compressive strength, a 38% increase in the splitting tensile strength, a 12% decrease in the water absorption, and a 23% decrease in the drying shrinkage with respect to the concrete containing 20% metakaolin. However, exceeding this optimal fiber content results in decreased mechanical and durability properties due to the fiber agglomeration and non-uniform fiber distribution within the concrete matrix. Based on the microstructural analysis, the improved performance of the concrete is ascribed to decreased porosity, more refined pore structure, and reduced propagation of microcracks within the concrete matrix in the presence of wastepaper fiber. According to the results, concrete containing 20% metakaolin and 1% wastepaper fiber exhibits durability and mechanical properties comparable to those of the traditional concrete. This finding highlights the significant promise of reducing dependency on conventional cement and incorporating suitable recycled materials, such as discarded plasterboard, and secondary by-products like metakaolin. Such a strategy encourages the preservation of resources, reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and a decrease in the ecological footprint resulting from concrete production.</description>

      <title>Simulation Insights into Carbon Mineralization Effects on Basaltic Seismic Properties</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3997/2214-4609.202410114</link>

                Summary This comprehensive study investigates the seismic response of basalt to CO2 injection, focusing on alterations in P- and S-wave velocities. We conduct simulations to examine how injecting CO2 into basalt affects P- and S-wave velocities, a process influenced by the substitution of water with CO2 and the formation of carbonate cement mineralization. This carbonation process can be tracked using seismic data through observed velocity changes. Our focus is on basalts primarily composed of minerals like iron, calcium, and magnesium, with an initial assumption of water-filled pore spaces. The mineralization process is modeled to predict the volume of cement formed and the associated decrease in porosity. We use a patchy cement model to calculate the velocities over time as CO2 is injected. Our example includes two phases: a one-week CO2 injection period followed by 29 weeks of frame cementation. After the first week, CO2 replaces water, leading to a reduction in density and P-wave velocity, while cementation results in increased bulk density and P-wave velocity, and a decrease in porosity and surface area. Therefore, this is the first study to directly link carbon mineralization's impact on seismic properties.</description>

                Summary This study introduces an innovative approach to carbon capture and storage (CCS) site monitoring by integrating DeepNRMS, an unsupervised deep learning method, with t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). Focusing on the Aquistore CO2 storage site, the research utilizes DeepNRMS to manage seismic time-lapse noise and improve accuracy in identifying CO2 plumes. The method employs pre-injection seismic images for training, analyzing embedding spaces using t-SNE to track the model's learning progression. By evaluating distances within this space, DeepNRMS demonstrates increased precision over traditional NRMS in filtering noise and highlighting CO2-induced signal changes. The study also details the application of t-SNE for dimensionality reduction, mapping high-dimensional data from the DeepNRMS encoder into a two-dimensional space to visualize and validate the model's performance. The results, particularly in different stages of CO2 injection at the Aquistore site, illustrate the model's effectiveness in distinguishing between noise and actual CO2 plumes.</description>

      <title>Re-Assessment of Cyclic Co2 Injection for Enhanced Oil Recovery and Co2 Storage in Unconventional Reservoirs Integrating Multi-Geomechanical and Multi-Geochemical Impacts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4848211</link>
      <description>Xun Hu, Bing Wei, Runxue Mao, Heng Wang, Jun Lu, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399163329

                Cyclic CO2 injection holds great potential for enhanced oil recovery and CO2 storage (CCUS-EOR) in unconventional reservoirs, with major projects in progress worldwide. There, however, is a lack of thorough understanding of CO2 migration and evolution behaviors over cycles at a large scale, particularly considering multi-geomechanical and multi-geochemical impacts. In this work, the complex CO2-oil-brine-rock interactions and rock stress-sensitivity were integrated into a well-established three-dimensional microseismic model to account for the impacts of geomechanics and geochemistry. The reaction kinetics model related to mineral composition aids in well-capturing changes in the petrophysical properties of the reservoir under in-situ conditions. The objective is to re-assess the CCUS-EOR response of cyclic CO2 injection in a specific tight reservoir and gain a comprehensive understanding of the CO2 transport process. The re-assessment results indicated that the cyclic CO2 injection model with geophysical and geochemical effects notably raised the oil recovery by 3.4% of original oil in place (OOIP) after ten cycles, with 48% of the injected CO2 being stored underground. The occurrence of multiple CO2 storage impeded CO2-oil interaction, resulting in a reduction of 25.9% in the volume of the CO2-oil mixing zone and 2.2% in the cumulative oil production, yet a 7.7% increase in the storage rate. Cyclic injection mode exerted a significant impact on the migration and evolution of CO2 in the reservoir. CO2 dissolution in oil serves as the primary trapping mechanism, but it also contributes significantly to CO2 production. The residual gas is particularly influenced by well operations and predominantly trapped in the non-fracture zone of the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV). After ten cycles, 20% of the injected CO2 (approximately 12,000 tons) was sequestered long-term through carbonate mineralization (6%), dissolution in connate water (6%), aqueous ions (4%), and trapped gas (4%). The mineral reaction rate was affected by intermittent operations, and the average matrix porosity and permeability induced by geochemical reactions were reduced by 0.61% and 1.62%, respectively. The results of this study supplement earlier findings in the CCUS-EOR dynamic process and offer guidance for maximizing EOR and long-term storage efficiency.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Sustainable Practices for Managing Residue Derived from Wheat Straw</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering11060554</link>
      <description>Harikishore Shanmugam, G.S.V. Raghavan, Rajinikanth Rajagopal, Bernard Goyette, Linxiang Lyu, Siyuan Zhou, Chunjiang An, Bioengineering. 11(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399174108

                Farm leftovers, particularly crop residues, are a key source of renewable energy in Canada. The nation&#8217;s robust agricultural industry provides ample biomass, derived from forestry and agriculture resources, for energy generation. Crop residues, such as straws and husks, play a crucial role in this biomass reservoir, contributing to biofuel production and greenhouse gas mitigation efforts. Focusing on supply chains, waste management, and emission reduction, this study evaluates the sustainability of wheat straw, an agricultural biomass by-product. The environmental issues of various approaches to managing agricultural biomass were explored. Following an evaluation of biomass features, conversion methods, and economic and environmental advantages, the results show anaerobic digestion to be the most sustainable approach. Four metrics were examined in relation to social elements, and numerous aspects were considered as inputs in the evaluation of transportation costs. The use of electric trucks versus fuel-based trucks resulted in an 18% reduction in total operating costs and a 58% reduction in consumption costs. This study examined CO2 emissions over four different transportation distances. The data indicate that a significant reduction of 36% in kg CO2 equivalent emissions occurred when the distance was lowered from 100 km to 25 km. These findings offer insights for creating practical plans that should increase the sustainability of agricultural biomass leftovers.</description>

                Direct CO2 conversion to liquid hydrocarbons (HCs) in a single process was achieved using cobalt (Co) catalysts supported on lanthanum ion (La3+)&#8208;doped cerium oxide (CeO2) under a gas stream of H2/CO2/N2 = 3/1/1. The yield of liquid HCs was the highest for 30 mol% of La3+&#8208;doped CeO2, which was because extrinsic oxygen vacancy formed by doping La3+ could act as an effective reaction site for reverse water gas shift reaction. However, the excess La3+ addition afforded surface covering lanthanum carbonates, resulting in depression of the catalytic performance. On the other hand, bare CeO2 lead to an increase in the selectivity of undesirable methane, which arose from reduction of CO2 to CO proceeding by intrinsic oxygen vacancy generated by only Ce3+, and weaker CO2 capture ability of intrinsic oxygen vacancy than extrinsic one, resulting in the proceeding of Sabatier reaction on Co catalyst. The rational design of reaction sites presented in this study will contribute to sustainability.</description>

                Injecting CO2 into the reservoir is an essential method for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) and enhanced oil recovery (EOR). However, due to the complex phase behavior between CO2 and hydrocarbons, the reservoir simulation of the injection process becomes time-consuming. To expedite phase equilibrium calculations (PECs) involved in CO2-EOR, we have developed an artificial neural network (ANN)-based PECs framework comprising the 1P-stability and 2P-flash models, which replaced traditional single-phase stability analysis and two-phase flash calculations. Additionally, We proposed a straightforward method for generating training points tailored to CO2-EOR production characteristics. Specific settings are placed on the two models to ensure a 100% correct solution, including predefining criteria to filter the stability model output and utilizing the flash model output as the standard algorithm initial value. We have enhanced the ANN-based models to integrate seamlessly with the compositional simulator. Four published fluids were selected to test this framework by implementing the standalone PECs, and one fluid was used for the simulation of CO2-EOR. The ANN-based framework can save up to 80% of time on phase equilibrium calculations, resulting in a 40% reduction in simulation time compared to the conventional algorithm. In summary, the newly developed ANN-based PECs framework shows great potential to accelerate the reservoir simulation for CO2-EOR, which helps design the program of CCUS by injecting CO2 into the reservoir.</description>

      <title>&lt;i&gt;In Situ&lt;/i&gt; Generated CO Enables High-Current CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction to Methanol in a Molecular Catalyst Layer</title>

                Molecular catalysts such as cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) exhibit remarkable electrochemical activity in methanol production from CO2 or CO, but fast conversion with a high current density is still yet to be realized. While adopting flow cells with gas diffusion electrodes is a common approach to enhanced reaction rates, the current scientific and engineering knowledge primarily centers on metal particle-based catalysts like Cu. This focus overlooks the emerging heterogenized molecular catalysts with distinct physical and chemical properties. In this work, we observe that the partial current density of CO reduction to methanol catalyzed by tetraamine-substituted CoPc (CoPc-NH2) supported on carbon nanotubes (CNTs) remains below 30 mA cm&#8211;2, even with systematic optimization of structural and operational parameters of the flow cell. A comparative analysis with a Cu metal catalyst reveals that the porous and electrolyte-philic nature of CoPc-NH2/CNT leaves a large fraction of active sites deprived of CO under reaction conditions. To address this microenvironmental challenge, we directly use CO2 as the reactant, leveraging its faster diffusion rate in water compared to CO. Effective CO2 reduction generates CO in situ to feed the catalytic sites, achieving an unprecedently high partial current density for methanol of 129 mA cm&#8211;2. This research underscores the necessity for new insights and approaches in the development of molecular catalyst-based electrodes.</description>

                El desarrollo y la producci&#243;n industrial, han requerido un alto uso de combustibles f&#243;siles lo que ha conllevado a un deterioro ambiental, en el contexto del cambio clim&#225;tico y gracias al Protocolo de Kioto, se cre&#243; el mercado de carbono como mecanismo de la econom&#237;a verde. Mediante el m&#233;todo PRISMA se realiz&#243; una revisi&#243;n descriptiva de literatura desde 2007 hasta el a&#241;o 2022 para conocer c&#243;mo se desarroll&#243; el mercado de bonos de carbono. En un primer momento, estos instrumentos financieros negociados en mercados internacionales facilitaron a pa&#237;ses desarrollados el cumplimiento de los compromisos de reducci&#243;n de emisiones, as&#237; como la financiaci&#243;n de proyectos limpios en pa&#237;ses en desarrollo, sin embargo, su demanda disminuy&#243; en 2013 bajo la cr&#237;tica de si ten&#237;an verdadero compromiso ambiental o se estaba beneficiando a las grandes industrias para que puedan contaminar m&#225;s. Finalmente, estos documentos fueron sustituidos por la negociaci&#243;n de bonos verdes al ser m&#225;s flexibles. Palabras Clave: cambio clim&#225;tico, deterioro ambiental, di&#243;xido de carbono, mercado financiero Abstract Industrial development and production have required a high use of fossil fuels, which has led to environmental deterioration. In thecontext of climate change and thanks to the Kyoto Protocol, the carbon market was created as a mechanism of the green economy. Using the PRISMA method, a descriptive literature review was carried out from 2007 to the year 2022 to learn how the carbon credit market developed. At first, these financial instruments negotiated in international markets facilitated developed countries to comply with emission reduction commitments, as well as the financing of clean projects in developing countries, however, their demand decreased in 2013 under the criticism of whether they had true environmental commitment or were benefiting large industriesso that they could pollute more. Eventually, these documents were replaced by the trading of green bonds because they were more flexible.Keywords: climate change, carbon dioxide, environmental degradation, financial markets</description>

      <title>Injectivity and Reactivity of Carbonated Water in Sandstone</title>

                Summary Injectivity problems can be very costly and the potential for formation damages should therefore be investigated for CO2 projects. The objective of the presented study was to evaluate the injectivity and reactivity of Carbonated Water (CW) in selected sandstone rock at reservoir conditions. Injectivity and reactivity of CW compared to Formation Water were investigated in flooding experiments in Bandera Gray plugs at 80&#176;C and 340 bar. Concentration of CO2 in the CW and the injection rates were varied. Little or no significant increase in differential pressure across plugs (dP) was measured during the flooding experiments, i.e. no or minor formation damage occurred especially at high injection rate. The low-rate floods had some reduction in the permeability depending on the CO2 concentration in CW. No fines were observed in effluent samples. The reactivity of the plugs and CW can be understood from the effluent ion compositions. Most of the effluent ion concentrations were stable with CW injection, however excess Magnesium and Iron ions were produced from the plugs. It is concluded that CW injectivity and reactivity should be investigated by varying CO2 concentration in CW and injection rates.</description>

      <title>Effects of Impurities on Anthropogenic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Pipeline Transport</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.4c00935</link>

                Efficient transportation of anthropogenic CO2 from emission sources to storage sites or utilization facilities is vital to realize full-scale Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS). The CO2 captured from emission sources is often contaminated with impurities that can significantly affect its thermophysical properties and flow behaviors during pipeline transportation. A holistic understanding of the impacts of these impurities is necessary to establish a cost-efficient and reliable CO2 pipeline transport system. In this study, we utilized an integrated thermophysical and fluid flow model and systematically analyzed the impurity effects of H2, N2, CH4, CO, O2, Ar, SO2, H2S, and H2 on the phase-envelopes, critical properties, density, viscosity, and pressure drop of CO2 streams. Each impurity was studied from zero to its highest concentration encountered in CCUS. The impacts of different impurities might be positive or negative to CO2 pipeline transportation depending on the system parameters being evaluated. H2 generally produces the most negative impacts on transportation, greatly enlarging the two-phase region, most significant reductions in density and viscosity, and highest pressure loss. In contrast, H2S has a much milder effect on most system properties. In this paper, we also ranked the impacts of impurities on different system properties by grading the effect of each impurity at 5 vol % concentration and discussed their indications on CO2 pipeline transportation. These results offer practical insights into the design, operation, and management of CCUS CO2 pipelines nowadays and in the future.</description>

      <title>Assessing Multilevel Environmental and Air Quality Changes in Australia Pre- and Post-COVID-19 Lockdown</title>

                Prior research has highlighted substantial shifts in environmental and air quality indicators preceding and following COVID-19 lockdowns, with implications for human well-being, climate, and air pollution. This groundbreaking study pioneers the quantification of multilevel changes&#8212;spanning national, regional, and local scales&#8212;in six pivotal satellite-derived land surface and air quality parameters before (November 2019&#8211;March 2020) and after lockdown (November 2020&#8211;March 2021) in Australia. Leveraging Google Earth Engine (GEE) and GIS capabilities, three land surface environmental parameters (Land Surface Temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Built-up Index), and three air quality parameters (Aerosol Optical Depth, Carbon Monoxide, and Nitrogen Dioxide) were derived. Environmental and air quality shifts between these periods were rigorously examined employing spatial and machine learning methodologies. Nationally, the lockdown led to a reduction in average Land Surface Temperature, likely due to increased vegetation and enhanced air quality. Similar trends were observed at regional and local scales, though intriguing exceptions emerged, such as elevated Land Surface Temperature in Melbourne and Darwin. This study showcases a robust analytical framework capable of comprehensively exploring multiscale environmental and air quality alterations, enabled by harnessing extensive Earth Observation datasets and spatial machine learning techniques. It offers valuable insights into understanding the profound environmental impacts associated with significant events like the COVID-19 pandemic.</description>

      <title>Application of Flotation for Removing Barium(II) Ions Using Ionized Acyclic Polyethers in the Context of Sustainable Waste Management</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114665</link>
      <description>Agnieszka Sobianowska-Turek, Katarzyna Grudniewska, A. Fornalczyk, J. Willner, W. Bialik, Weronika Urba&#324;ska, Anna Janda, Sustainability. 16(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399172384

                Energy transition is one of the basic actions taken to counteract and prevent climate change. The basic assumption of energy-related changes is its sustainable use according to the closed-loop model, as well as moving away from fossil fuels, in particular from coal, the combustion of which contributes to excessive harmful carbon dioxide emissions. One of the most popular solutions towards green energy is nuclear energy. Its use allows for a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions harmful to the environment and climate, but it also involves the generation of radioactive waste that requires appropriate processing. This paper presents the results of the flotation removal of barium(II) ions from a dilute aqueous solution using ionized acyclic polyethers. The basic factors determining the efficiency and kinetics of the process were defined. It has been shown that as the acidity of the attached polyether molecules increases: the flotation rate constant 1 (0.1667 min&#8722;1) &lt; 3 (0.2468 min&#8722;1) &lt; 2 (0.3616 min&#8722;1) and the separation degree Ba2+: 1 (86.8%) &lt; 3 (99.3%) &lt; 2 (99.4%). The presented results of ion flotation tests may facilitate the collective or selective separation of radioactive isotopes, i.e., Cs-137, Sr-90, Ba-133 and Co-60, from radioactive wastewater in the future. The results of the experimental work described in the article can also be used to develop individual processes for separating mixtures of radioactive isotopes (radioactive wastewater) into individual components (isotopes) and subjecting them to subsequent transformation processes. The obtained results allow us to claim that the tested organic compounds can be used in the future in the selective treatment of hazardous wastewater, which will translate into a reduction in unit costs of industrial processes. The selective recovery of individual pollutants is the basis for the next step in waste management, i.e., designing a cheap method of waste disposal, which also directly affects the economics of the process and its use in industrial conditions.</description>

      <title>Research and Application of Non-Steady-State CO2 Huff-n-Puff Oil Recovery Technology in High-Water-Cut and Low-Permeability Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/pr12061120</link>

                In response to the issues of poor water flooding efficiency, low oil production rates, and low recovery rates during the high-water-cut period in the low-permeability reservoirs of the Mutou Oilfield, the non-steady-state (NSS) CO2 huff-n-puff oil recovery technology was explored. The NSS CO2 huff-n-puff can improve the development effect of low-permeability reservoirs by replenishing the reservoir energy and significantly increasing the crude oil mobility. Experimental investigations were carried out, including a crude oil and CO2&#8211;crude oil swelling experiment, minimum miscibility pressure testing experiment, high-temperature and high-pressure microfluidic experiment, and NSS CO2 huff-n-puff oil recovery on-site pilot test. The experimental results showed that the main mechanisms of NSS CO2 huff-n-puff include dissolution, expansion, viscosity reduction, and swept volume enlargement, which can effectively mobilize the remaining oil from the various pore throats within the reservoir. The high-temperature and high-pressure microfluidic experiment achieved an ultimate recovery rate of 83.1% for NSS CO2 huff-n-puff, which was 7.9% higher than the rate of 75.2% obtained for steady injection. This method can effectively utilize the remaining oil in the corners and edges, enlarge the swept volume, and increase the recovery rate. Field trials of NSS CO2 huff-n-puff in a low-permeability reservoir in the Mutou Oilfield indicated that it cumulatively increased the oil production by 1134.5 tons. The achieved results and insights were systematically analyzed and could provide key technical support for the application of NSS CO2 huff-n-puff technology in low-permeability reservoirs, promoting the innovative development of this technology.</description>

                Abstract. The rate at which atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) would decrease in response to decrease of anthropogenic emissions or cessation (net zero emissions) is of great scientific and societal interest. Such decrease in atmospheric CO2 on the centennial scale would be due essentially entirely to transfer of carbon into the world ocean (WO) and the terrestrial biosphere (TB), which are sink compartments on this time scale. The rate of decrease of excess atmospheric CO2 and the apportionment of this decrease into the two sink compartments has been examined in two prior model intercomparison studies, subsequent either to a pulse emission of CO2 or to abrupt cessation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The present study examines and quantifies inter-model anticorrelation in those studies in the net rate and extent of uptake of CO2 into the two sink compartments. Specifically, in each study the time-dependent coefficients characterizing the net transfer rate into the two sink compartments, (evaluated as the net transfer rate normalized to excess atmospheric CO2 above pre-pulse amount, for the pulse experiment; or as the net transfer rate divided by excess atmospheric CO2 above preindustrial amount, for the abrupt cessation experiment) was found to exhibit strong anticorrelation across the participating models. That is, models for which the normalized rate of uptake into the WO was high exhibited low uptake rate into the TB, and vice versa. This anticorrelation in net transfer rate results in anticorrelation in net uptake extent into the two compartments that is substantially greater than would be expected simply from competition for excess CO2 between the two sink compartments. This anticorrelation, which is manifested in diminished inter-model diversity, can lead to artificially enhanced confidence in current understanding of the consequences of potential future reductions of CO2 emissions and in the global warming potentials of non-CO2 greenhouse gases relative to that of CO2.</description>

      <title>Effect of Algal Biomass on the Properties of Calcium Sulfoaluminate Cement</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c01007</link>

                Calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement is a low-CO2 alternative to portland cement (OPC). To further enhance its sustainability, the use of CO2-storing algal biomass and algal biochar was explored herein as carbon-negative cement retarding admixtures. CSA cement was replaced with 0, 5, 10, or 15% raw algal biomass or biochar derived from the raw algal biomass. Results showed that increasing raw algae dosage led to longer delays in hydration; however, the retardation effect was not observed in samples containing algal biochar due to the absence of hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups in biochar. Delays in cement hydration due to the incorporation of raw algal biomass corresponded to lower compressive strengths, as anticipated. Despite these reductions, the compressive strengths of the CSA cement pastes were similar to the control OPC pastes due to the inherently high initial compressive strengths of CSA cement compared to OPC. Both raw algae and biochar effectively lowered the net CO2 emissions of CSA and OPC, with biochar samples exhibiting lower CO2 emissions relative to raw algae when normalized for strength performance. Overall, the results suggest that algae may be used effectively with CSA cement for a more workable and sustainable binder system.</description>

      <title>Using CSEM for CCUS Fluid Monitoring: Examples and Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3997/2214-4609.2024101356</link>
      <description>Kurt Strack, C&#233;sar Barajas&#8208;Olalde, S. Davydycheva, M. Silva, P. Sopious, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399186150

                Summary Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS) is a pillar of the energy transition. Two key technical elements are CO2 containment (seal integrity) and storage volumes (dynamic fluid plume) requiring geophysical monitoring. Over the past years, we carried out various electromagnetic surface monitoring surveys. When using the right workflow we can obtain surface data that is reconciled to borehole log scale. This makes the data certifiable in that context. For one application, the storage reservoir is a saline aquifer, we used Controlled Source ElectroMagnetics (CSEM) combined with magnetotellurics (MT) to obtain the background geologic structure. It included a high-power CSEM transmitter (200 KVA) and multi-component receivers to see resistive and conductive strata. Presently, we prepare for CO2 to be stored in basalt formation, where it solidifies. When CO2 is injected into basalt, it is first gaseous or liquid phase (pressure dependent) which causes a reduction in resistivity of the basalt reservoir followed by a strong resistivity increase when it solidifies. Another application is to contain CO2 under hydrocarbon reservoirs associated with salt dome provinces. We verified CSEM imaging over various salt domes to image the reservoir boundaries accurately.</description>

                Achieving high activities and selectivity for the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction at low-temperatures continues to pose a significant challenge. Ni-based catalysts have been widely employed in CO2 hydrogenation due to their strong capacity to dissociate H2, but they exhibit low selectivity for CO. Herein, we successfully altered the product selectivity for CO2 hydrogenation via controlling the distribution of Ga species on Ni/CeO2 catalysts. When Ga was combined with Ni to form the spinel of NiGa2O4 (NiGa2O4/CeO2), the main product selectivity was CO. While, the Ga was doped into CeO2 to support Ni (Ni/Ga4-CeO2), the product selectivity was the CH4. The NiGa2O4 spinel supported on CeO2 exhibited excellent performance in the RWGS reaction, with a CO selectivity over 99%, and a production rate as high as 74.5 mmol/gcat&#183;h at 450 oC and 24000 mL/gcat&#183;h, without any loss of activity after 72 h. The Ni/Ga4-CeO2, containing metallic Ni species and abundant oxygen vacancies, enhanced the methanation process, with a CO2 conversion as high as 81.38%, and a CH4 production rate of 136 mmol/gcat&#183;h. The CO-TPD analysis revealed that the NiGa2O4/CeO2 catalyst exhibited weak adsorption of CO*, which played a key role in enhancing the selectivity towards CO. Subsequent in-situ DRIFTS analysis further confirmed that the differences in CO2 hydrogenation product obtained from NiGa4/CeO2 and Ni/Ga4-CeO2 were due to the formation of different intermediate species over their surface, leading to a change in the selectivity of CO2 hydrogenation products. This study provides a new idea to switch the product selectivity for CO2 reduction by controlling the distribution of Ga species.</description>

                Summary Carbon capture and storage is one of the key elements of atmospheric greenhouse gas reduction. Carbon storage projects often explore areas where little data exist. Faults in the storage complex impact on the migration and retention of CO2 plumes, CO2 injectivity, and the pressure propagation in the larger aquifer. Using a global database of core plug samples from hydrocarbon exploration and production, where mercury injection capillary entry pressure measurements are available for host rock - fault rock pairs in faulted reservoir sandstones, a statistical analysis of capillary entry pressure increase and permeability decrease from host to fault rock is presented. The analysis intends to provide a realistic range of host to fault rock multipliers for modeling purposes. It is found that the deformation mechanism, which is a function of burial depth at the time of faulting, plays a larger role than the clay content of the sample. Cataclasites in pure sandstones, phyllosilicate framework fault rocks, and clay smears all have very similar median values of capillary entry pressure increase and permeability reduction, compared to their respective host reservoir rocks. Disaggregation zones are the only fault rocks that deviate from this trend.</description>

                The carbon dioxide emission due to fuel-based vehicle transportation was greatly reduced by the usage of electric vehicles (EVs). The energy management of battery systems in EV plays a vital role in the development of modern vehicles. The consumption of energy by EVs depends on vehicle parameters and path details. By monitoring these parameters, the energy prediction models are developed to predict future energy consumption, which increases the vehicle performance, and to avoid driver's range anxiety problems. Artificial intelligence (AI) helps to develop sophisticated energy prediction models in EV systems. The machine learning (ML) algorithms are harnessed to predict future energy requirements based on the vehicle's prior details. Recurrent neural network algorithms and sequence-based ML algorithms are effectively forecasting required energy in EV models. In this proposed work, a sequence-based hybrid deep ML algorithm is employed because of its ability to intricate relationships within the dataset. Long-short-term memory and gated recurrent unit algorithms are bootstrap aggregated to make a hybrid bagging deep ML model. The model is developed using an EV model BMWi3 driving trips dataset. The EV dataset is preprocessed using the dimensionality reduction method. The random forest-based feature selection algorithm is used to achieve dimensionality reduction. The details of the EV vehicle's battery current, battery voltage, driving velocity, electric motor torque, elevation of the road, throttle, environmental temperature, and battery state of charge are selected as important features to model the dataset for AI model training. The model is validated by a fivefold cross-validation method. The results reveal that the predicted energy consumption values are nearly equal to the original energy consumed values. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The MSE of the proposed prediction algorithm is achieved as 0.20%, and the MAE is achieved as 0.4%. The results show that the proposed model can be implemented in hardware for the design of an effective energy management system in modern EVs to retrieve the issue of driver anxiety and improve performance.</description>

      <title>Delayed effects of air pollution on public bike-sharing system use in Seoul, South Korea: A time series analysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2024.117030</link>
      <description>Eun&#8208;Hye Yoo, John &#919;. Roberts, Young-Joo Suh, Social science &amp; medicine. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399209089

                As a complementary means to urban public transit systems, public bike-sharing provides a green and active mode of sustainable mobility, while reducing carbon-dioxide emissions and promoting health. There has been increasing interest in factors affecting bike-sharing usage, but little is known about the effect of ambient air pollution. To assess the short-term impact of daily exposure to multiple air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3) on the public bike-sharing system (PBS) usage in Seoul, South Korea (2018--2021), we applied a quasi-Poisson generalized linear model combined with a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM). The model was adjusted for day of the week, holiday, temperature, relative humidity, and long-term trend. We also conducted stratification analyses to examine the effect modification by age group, seasonality, and COVID-19. We found that there was a negative association between daily ambient air pollution and the PBS usage level at a single lag day 1 (i.e., air quality a day before the event) across all four pollutants. Our results suggest that days with high levels of air pollutants (at 95th percentile) are associated with 0.91% (0.86% to 0.96%) for PM2.5, 0.89% (0.85% to 0.94%) for PM10, 0.87% (0.82% to 0.91%) for O3, 0.92% (0.87% to 0.98%) for NO2, reductions in cycling behavior in the next day compared to days with low levels of pollutants (at 25th percentile). No evidence of effect modification was found by seasonality, age nor the COVID-19 pandemic for any of the four pollutants. Our findings suggest that high concentrations of ambient air pollution are associated with decreased rates of PBS usage on the subsequent day regardless of the type of air pollutant measured.</description>

      <title>Pilot-scale study on combustion characteristics, slagging characteristics and flue gas composition of coal oilfield wastewater slurry</title>

                As the volume of oil extraction continues to rise, the issue of oilfield wastewater treatment has become increasingly urgent. Traditional water treatment technologies struggle to effectively and economically eliminate the pollution caused by oilfield wastewater, as well as efficiently utilize its various components. This study proposes the utilization of oilfield wastewater for the preparation of coal water slurry, and the combustion experiments of coal oilfield wastewater slurry (COWS) and original coal water slurry (CWS) under various working conditions are conducted on a pilot-scale horizontal furnace. The investigation focused on the combustion characteristics, slagging characteristics and flue gas composition, as these indicators directly impact the industrial application of such slurry fuel. The combustion characteristics results reveal that both COWS and CWS demonstrate stable ignition and combustion across all working conditions, with combustion efficiency exceeding 99.69%, and the incorporation of oilfield wastewater promotes volatiles precipitation and combustion. The slagging characteristics results indicate that the flame temperature within the furnace is critical in determining slagging occurrence, and the incorporation of oilfield wastewater increases the likelihood of slagging. The flue gas composition measurement results indicate that the incorporation of oilfield wastewater slightly elevates carbon monoxide (CO) levels, albeit within a low concentration range. Additionally, oilfield wastewater demonstrates a modest reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. These test results underscore that incorporating oilfield wastewater into the preparation of fuel coal water slurry not only facilitates thorough treatment of oilfield wastewater, but also enhance the combustion performance of slurry fuel within the furnace, thereby offering significant industrial application potential.</description>

                Summary In response to the need for effective CO2 emission reduction to meet climate targets, the Danish government is actively identifying and evaluating potential Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) sites. The study focuses on the Upper Triassic-Jurassic Gassum and Fjerritslev formations in the Danish Basin, employing forward stratigraphic modeling to characterize reservoir-seal combinations with limited data. Two potential onshore sites for CO2 storage were identified through a basin-scale model, considering factors such as pressure, temperature, and porosity. The study involved calibration using well and field data to create a reference basin model, serving as the initial state for subsequent CO2 injection simulations. Four injection scenarios were tested, ranging from 30Mt to 150Mt per injection spot over 60 years, with plume evolution monitored for 3000 years. The results indicated effective containment within the Gassum Formation during injection and the relaxation phase. However, increased aquifer pressure within a 130 km radius raised concerns about associated risks and necessitates further studies to derisk CCS operations.</description>

      <title>Adjusting the phase transition time node of a solid&#8211;liquid biphasic solvent based on 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol for efficient CO2 capture: Insight into the regulatory effect of aminoethylethanolamine</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2024.128149</link>
      <description>Xiaobin Zhou, Ting Zou, Wei Wang, Zhifang Tu, Yinming Fan, Jianwen Wei, Lei Liao, Zongqiang Zhu, Yinian Zhu, Dunqiu Wang, Guohua Jing, Separation and purification technology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399243375

                Solid-liquid biphasic solvents (SLBSs) hold promise as energy-efficient candidates for CO2 capture. Nevertheless, the premature phase transition of current SLBSs leads to inopportune solid precipitation, posing operational challenges for the CO2 capture system. This study proposed a promising strategy that using aminoethylethanolamine (AEEA) as a regulator to fine-tune the phase transition time node of the 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP)/N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) SLBS, enabling the phase transition to occur precisely as desired. Experimental results showed that the AEEA/AMP/NMP (A/A/N) SLBS exhibited tunable phase transition time nodes, modulated by the concentration of AEEA. Specifically, with the addition of 0.2 mol&#183;L&#8722;1 AEEA, the CO2 loading associated with the phase transition increased significantly, from 0.19 to 0.54 mol&#183;mol&#8722;1, approaching the saturation loading of 0.57 mol&#183;mol&#8722;1. The delayed phase transition would facilitate the CO2 absorption operation. The regulatory mechanism of AEEA on the phase transition were thoroughly studied via 13C NMR and quantum calculations. AMP reacted with CO2 to produce AMPCOO&#8722; and AMPH+, which had a significantly stronger affinity for each other than for the solvent NMP, mediated by strong hydrogen bond interactions. Consequently, the continuous and fast aggregation of AMPCOO&#8722; and AMPH+ caused their swift precipitation from NMP. With the introduction of AEEA, the derived product AEEAH+(S)COO&#8211;(P) acted as a bridge-builder, connecting AMPCOO&#8722; or AMPH+ and NMP via hydrogen bonds, increasing the solubility of the AMP-derived products in NMP, thus effectively delaying the phase transition. Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the A/A/N SLBS exhibited a total regeneration energy consumption of 1.94 GJ&#183;ton&#8722;1 CO2, representing a significant reduction of 48.9 % compared to that of 30 wt% MEA. This study provided a novel idea for designing SLBSs with controllable phase transition behavior, and offered a promising A/A/N SLBS for energy-efficient CO2 capture.</description>

                The reduction of CO2 emissions is a critical challenge on which scientific research is mainly focused on recent times. The study represents an innovative method to utilize the strong computational power of CMG-GEM the numerical reservoir simulator coupled with the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict carbon storage and sequestration capacity in saline aquifers. The key parameters in geological storage formations are identified, by generating a diverse dataset from CMG-GEM simulation runs by varying the different geological and operational parameters such as injector bottom hole pressure (BHP), injection rate, aquifer thickness, aquifer volume, hysteresis factor, porosity, reservoir pressure vertical and horizontal permeability. Robust Data analysis was done to understand the effects of these parameters and access the different CO2 trapping mechanism types including structural, dissolved, mineral, and aqueous ions states. The generated dataset was used in the MATLAB neural network toolbox to develop an ANN model for CO2 storage and sequestration prediction across various trapping mechanisms. Rigorous testing and validation processes are performed to optimize the ANN model resulting in an accuracy of 98% using the best algorithm. The high accuracy reflects the model's reliability in evaluating the CO2 storage and sequestration in saline aquifers. Furthermore, the simulation and ANN hybrid approach was not only considered a successful and innovative technical solution but also addresses a way to optimize and minimize the time of CO2 subsurface storage evaluation as the ANN model can deliver very accurate results from relatively minimal simulation runs. Therefore, it was significantly reduced the number of simulations runs which requires high computational power and long simulation running time.</description>

                Summary To meet emissions reductions targets by mid-century, dozens of geological CO2 storage projects are currently being developed in the offshore UK. Many of these are in the Southern North Sea, targeting the large saline aquifers in the Bunter sandstone. To design and operate these projects effectively, seismicity rates need to be accurately characterised. Measuring seismicity can provide insights into the stress state in the region, fault density and faulting style, as well as fracturing in the overburden. Understanding background seismicity is also key to discriminating and determining the risk of induced seismicity that could result from injection. To significantly improve the detection of smaller events in the Southern North Sea region, we have deployed a dense array of three-component broadband sensors on the North York Moors ( Figure 1 ). Using this data and beamforming methods, we have more accurately characterised earthquake rates in the Southern North Sea, informing the development of CO2 storage operations in the region. Telemetry systems have also been deployed, showing that onshore dense arrays could act as a cost effective, real time, continuous monitoring method of the reservoir response to CO2 injection.</description>

                Ternary Cu/Zn/ZrO2 catalysts prepared recently using atomic layer deposition (ALD) have shown increased performance toward methanol synthesis. In the present computational study, we have investigated the structure, composition, and stability of various zinc- and copper-containing subnano size species on a zirconia support. Density functional theory calculations with minima hopping were used to sample the positioning and geometry of supported ZnxCuyOz structures up to 8 metal atoms in total. ZnO monomeric species were found to be energetically more favorable than small clusters, which could suggest a resistance to initial stage agglomeration. Ab-initio thermodynamics revealed that under typical methanol synthesis conditions, the complete reduction of ZnO and mixed ZnO/Cu clusters is unfavorable. The investigated ZnO monomers and clusters are able to provide CO2 activation sites, with the Cu/ZnO/ZrO2 triple interface offering the best stabilization for the adsorbed CO2. All in all, the findings suggest that small ZnO species generated by ALD could be stabilized by the zirconia component, while contact with copper species at the interface benefits CO2 activation.</description>

                The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) has the potential to be an economically viable method to produce platform chemicals synergistically with renewable energy sources. Copper is one of the most commonly used electrocatalysts for this purpose, as it allows C&#8211;C bond formation, yielding a broad product distribution. Controlling selectivity is a stepping stone on the way to its industrial application. The kinetics of the reaction can be modified to favor the rates of certain products quickly and inexpensively by applying additives such as ionic liquids and coelectrolytes that directly affect the electrocatalytic interface. In this work, we propose tethered tetraalkylammonium salts as double-charged cationic modifiers of the electrochemical double layer to control CO2RR product selectivity. A novel setup comprising a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) flow cell coupled with real-time mass spectroscopy was used to study the effect of a library of the selected salts. We emphasize how the length of an alkyl linker effectively controls the selectivity of the reaction toward C1, C2, or C3 products at high relevant current densities (Jtotal = &#8722;400 mA cm&#8211;2) along with the inhibition of the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction. Standard long-term experiments were performed for quantitative validation and stability evaluation. These results have broad implications for further tailoring an effective catalytic system for selective CO2 reduction reaction.</description>

      <title>Core-in-shell, glucose-templated, ZrO2-stabilized calcium/copper-based pellets with robust CO2 capture performance for Ca/Cu process</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2024.128241</link>
      <description>Jian Chen, Weimin Xia, Huiping Tang, Anqi Huang, Changqiang Huang, Y. Li, Yuxin Jiang, Zhicheng Wang, Yu Gu, Bin Qi, Separation and purification technology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399207529

                Calcium/copper-based pellets are crucial to the advancement of the Ca/Cu process, as CuO reduction provides the heat necessary for CaCO3 calcination. Yet, a significant challenge lies in preserving their CO2 capture performance, which tends to deteriorate rapidly. Thus in this study, we proposed a two-stage method to synthesize core-in-shell, glucose-templated, ZrO2-stabilized calcium/copper-based pellets that are highly efficient at capturing CO2. The designed pellets featured a core concentrated with CaO and CuO, surrounded by an outer shell of ZrO2. Initially, different particle size ranges of unstabilized calcium/copper-based pellets were fabricated, including 200&#8211;470, 210&#8211;600, 400&#8211;890, and 800&#8211;1090 &#956;m. A minor improvement in CO2 capture performance was observed with decreasing particle sizes, ranging from 0.16 to 0.20 gCO2/gmaterial. However, a noticeable decline in CO2 capture performance was observed in these unstabilized calcium/copper-based pellets during cycling. To address this issue, these pellets were then coated with a ZrO2 shell. The core-in-shell, ZrO2-stabilized calcium/copper-based pellets possessed much-improved CO2 sorption stability, mainly due to that the ZrO2 shell mitigated the degradation of the pore structure resulting from sintering during cycling. Finally, glucose was incorporated as a pore-forming material into the core-in-shell, ZrO2-stabilized calcium/copper-based pellets, improving the pore structure and further boosting their reactivity. The incorporation of glucose proved to be beneficial, resulting in enhanced capacity and stability for CO2 sorption for the core-in-shell, glucose-templated, ZrO2-stabilized calcium/copper-based pellets. The best-performing sample, i.e., calcium/copper-based pellets with the simultaneous coating of a ZrO2 shell and the incorporation of glucose, demonstrated a sorption capacity of 0.26 gCO2/gmaterial in the initial cycle. This capacity decreased to 0.18 gCO2/gmaterial in the tenth cycle, retaining 70 % of its initial reactivity.</description>

      <title>Supercritical CO2 Extraction of Terpenoids from Indocalamus latifolius Leaves: Optimization, Purification, and Antioxidant Activity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/foods13111719</link>
      <description>Y. Chen, Yanbin Wang, Li He, Liling Wang, Jingzhe Zhao, Zongming Yang, Li Q, Rui Shi, Foods. 13(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399174807

                This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) extraction in enhancing the extraction rate, purity, and antioxidant activity of Indocalamus latifolius (Keng) McClure (Poaceae) leaf terpenoids (ILLTs). Crude extracts obtained from leaves were subjected to qualitative and quantitative analyses, revealing neophytadiene, phytol, &#946;-sitosterol, &#946;-amyrone, squalene, and friedelin as the primary terpenoid constituents, identified through gas chromatography&#8211;mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Compared with steam distillation extraction (SD), simultaneous distillation extraction (SDE), ultra-high pressure-assisted n-hexane extraction (UHPE-Hex), ultra-high pressure-assisted ethanol extraction (UHPE-EtOH), ultrasound-assisted n-hexane extraction (UE-Hex), and ultrasound-assisted ethanol extraction (UE-EtOH), SC-CO2 exhibited a superior ILLT extraction rate, purity, and antioxidant activity. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations of the residues further revealed more severe damage to both the residues and their cell walls after SC-CO2 extraction. Under optimal parameters (4.5 h, 26 MPa, 39 &#176;C, and 20% ethyl alcohol), the ILLT extraction rate with SC-CO2 reached 1.44 &#177; 0.12 mg/g, which was significantly higher than the rates obtained by the other six methods. The subsequent separation and purification using WelFlash C18-l, BUCHI-C18, and Sephadex LH-20 led to an increase in the purity of the six terpenoid components from 12.91% to 93.34%. Furthermore, the ILLTs demonstrated cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells with an IC50 value of 148.93 &#177; 9.93 &#956;g/mL. Additionally, with increasing concentrations, the ILLTs exhibited an enhanced cellular antioxidant status, as evidenced by reductions in both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels.</description>

                The scale of offshore wind energy has been rapidly growing worldwide in recent years. Accurate assessment of the offshore wind energy potential and emission reduction benefits is essential to realize the ambitious targets for future installations. In this study, the Shandong Sea of China was selected as a case study, and the long-term offshore wind energy potential was assessed using ERA5 reanalysis data for the last 30 years, including the spatio-temporal variation and the technical potential of wind resources. An innovative approach to evaluate the technical potential of installed offshore wind farms based on deep learning, satellite images and ERA5 reanalysis data was proposed and applied to the Shandong Sea. The results show that (1) the highest offshore wind energy potential is observed in the northeast sea of Weihai; (2) the inter-annual variation of wind resources is relatively modest, with a pronounced monthly variability. The richest wind resources are found in the spring; (3) the electricity generation of wind resources is 12.66&#8764;30.53 GWh/year, equivalent to a reduction of 9.35&#8764;22.55 Kt of CO2 emissions; (4) as of 2023, there were 12 OWFs including 633 offshore wind turbines in Shandong Sea, generating 14,218 GWh/year of clean electricity and reducing 10,505 Kt/year of CO2 emissions. The method proposed in this study is applicable to both small- and large-scale areas and allows for an accurate assessment of the electricity generation from installed offshore wind farms.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.7250/conect.2024.038</link>
      <description>Francesco Romagnoli, Claudio Rochas, Riccardo Paoli, Augustine Owusuansah, Cornelius Odai, Silvia Kobel, CONECT. International Scientific Conference of Environmental and Climate Technologies. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399067641

                This study presents a comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a Nearly Zero Energy Building (NZEB) in Accra, Ghana, comparing its environmental impact with a conventional Business-As-Usual (BAU) building over a 50-year lifespan. Adhering to ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 standards, the research evaluates the carbon footprint and operational efficiencies essential to sustainable building designs. Utilizing SimaPro 9.5 software and the IPCC 2021 GWP100 method, the total carbon footprint was quantified at 1727 tons of CO2-equivalent for the NZEB, significantly lower than the BAU comparison. The analysis highlights the operational phase, including waste generation as the most substantial contributor to the NZEB's environmental impact, accounting for 725 tons of CO2-equivalent emissions. Conversely, the strategic inclusion of solar panels and enhanced material selection for the NZEB markedly reduced energy demands, contributing to a net positive environmental outcome with an avoided carbon footprint of approximately -859.72 tons CO2-eq. This reduction underpins the NZEB's effectiveness in leveraging eco-friendly materials and renewable technologies, setting a benchmark for future sustainable construction practices. The study ultimately advocates for an integrated approach, harmonizing technological innovation with environmental stewardship, to mitigate the carbon footprint of the built environment, steering the construction industry towards sustainability.</description>

                The bonding effects between 3d transition&#8208;metal single sites and supports originate from crystal field stabilization energy (CFSE). The 3d transition&#8208;metal atoms of the spontaneous geometrical distortions, that is the Jahn&#8208;Teller effect, can alter CFSE, thereby leading to the Irving&#8208;Williams series. However, engineering single&#8208;atom sites (SASs) using the Irving&#8208;Williams series as an ideal guideline has not been reported to date. Herein, alkynyl&#8208;linked covalent phenanthroline frameworks (CPFs) with phenanthroline units are developed to anchor the desired 3d single metal ions from d5 to d10 (Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+). The Irving&#8208;Williams series was employed to accurately predict the bonding effects between 3d transition&#8208;metal atoms and phenanthroline units. To verify this, theoretical calculations and experimental results reveal that Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs exhibits higher stability and faster charge&#8208;transfer efficiency, far surpassing other metal&#8208;SASs/CPFs. As expected, Cu&#8208;SASs/CPFs demonstrates a high photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO activity (~30.3 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1) and an exceptional photooxidation of CH3CHO&#8208;to&#8208;CH3COOH activity (~24.7 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8208;1&#183;h&#8208;1). Interestingly, the generated *O2&#8208; is derived from the process of CO2 reduction, thereby triggering a CH3CHO oxidation reaction. This work provides a novel design concept for designing SASs by the Irving&#8208;Williams to regulate the catalytic performances.</description>

      <title>Catalytic conversion of CO2 to dimethyl ether: A review of recent advances in catalysts and water selective layer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiec.2024.05.058</link>
      <description>Ng Jia Le, Yeong Yin Fong, Journal of industrial and engineering chemistry/Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry - Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399143386

                Emissions of CO2 from different sectors including oil and gas, energy, agriculture and industries have increased significantly over the past decades. In order to achieve carbon reduction target of cutting down carbon intensity against gross domestic product (GDP) by 45% by 2030 compared to 2010 and reaching net zero emission by 2050 as per stated in Paris Climate Agreement, Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) technology have been widely applied to alleviate the CO2 emissions problem. Among the CO2 utilization strategies, conversion of CO2 to dimethyl ether (DME) is considered as one of the most attractive routes for the large-scale CO2 valorization due to its advantage to serve as an alternative fuel for diesel and wide application in various industry which leads to large global market size for DME. Synthesis of DME from CO2 can be achieved through both indirect and direct synthesis processes in which indirect synthesis of DME will undergo CO2 hydrogenation over metallic catalyst and dehydration of methanol over acid catalyst separately, while direct synthesis of DME will undergo both reactions within a single reactor over a bifunctional catalyst. However, low CO2 conversion, low DME selectivity and also rapid catalyst deactivation due to the formation of water throughout the DME synthesis process have attracted increased attentions from researchers of modifying metallic catalysts through addition of zirconium, iron, palladium and other element as promoter, discover alternative acid catalysts to replace commercial &#947;-Al2O3 and to develop bifunctional catalyst through combining metallic catalyst with acid catalyst to enable the operation of direct DME synthesis. Thus, a series of researches have been conducted to study the performance of different catalysts under different combination of elements in order to improve the DME yield from the reaction. Aside from that, another strategy has also been performed in past few years by application of water selective membrane layer in the DME synthesis process to reduce the impacts of water formation towards the DME yields. Thus, in-situ water removal performance for different types of polymeric and zeolite membranes as well as dual-layer (FAU-LTA) membrane in DME synthesis have been investigated in recent years. In this review paper, development and performance of several main types of metallic catalysts, acid catalysts, bifunctional catalysts and water selective hydrophilic membrane which have been reported will be discussed to understand the gaps for current research on DME synthesis. In the aspect of future work, the performance for different combinations of bifunctional catalysts with water selective removal layer in direct DME synthesis need to be explored. Besides, the use of metallic catalyst together with acidic water selective membrane or dual layer membrane can be a potential future trend to improve CO2 conversion and DME yield.</description>

      <title>Relation to Blood Chemistry and Acid-Base Balance</title>

                Abstract The physiologic mechanisms of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) buffering in relation to blood chemistry and acid-base balance are crucial in understanding the ventilatory response to metabolic derangements and induced changes in intracranial pressure (ICP). Hyperventilation is often used in the context of head trauma or neurosurgical procedures to reduce ICP; however, careful use of this technique is critical. Because non-ionized CO2 molecules, and not ionized molecules such as H+, are able to cross the blood-brain barrier, induced changes in cerebrovascular blood flow (CBF) are largely independent of systemic arterial pH. Due to compensatory mechanisms, CBF will return to baseline as both blood and CSF pH return to normal over 6&#8211;24 hours, regardless of continued hyperventilation. Preoperative communication with the neurosurgical team prior to procedure is key for planning any potential need for reduction in ICP to improve operative conditions. Postoperatively this return to baseline must be kept in mind as prolonged hyperventilation also results in increased &#8220;CO2 reactivity,&#8221; making the patient more susceptible to acute rises in ICP.</description>

      <title>EU ETS Market Expectations and Rational Bubbles</title>

                The European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) aimed to combat CO2 emissions in Europe, but concerns arose during the third trading period (2013-2020) due to rising prices, sparking speculation about a potential price bubble, compromising the system's efficiency. Distorted price signals lead to suboptimal abatement choices by firms. We argue that (i) testing for rational bubbles based on transition costs, from cheap, polluting to costly, clean energy, is limited to scenarios of market certainty, which is unrealistic given evolving CO2 reduction measures, and (ii) defining fundamental value through switching costs lacks a singular approach, leading to inconclusive findings. As a more robust alternative, our study suggests testing for rational bubbles based on futures prices. This approach remains robust even with a trending risk premium component in the futures price. Empirical findings reveal no evidence of a rational bubble in the third or fourth trading period of the EU ETS.</description>

      <title>Electric Double Layer Effect on the Outer-Sphere Benzyl Halides Electro-Reduction Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c08224</link>
      <description>Aleksandr S. Kramarenko, Ivan Yu. Chernyshov, Evgeny A. Pidko, Journal of physical chemistry. C./Journal of physical chemistry. C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399181814

                Electrocatalytic reduction of organic halides and subsequent carboxylation are promising methods for the valorization of CO2 as a C1 source in synthetic organic chemistry. The reaction mechanism underlying the selectivity and reduction mechanism of benzyl halides is highly dependent on the nature of the electrode material as well as the processes, composition, and structure of the liquid phase at the electrode&#8211;solution interface. Herein, we present a computational study on the influence of the electric double layer (EDL) on the activation of benzyl halides at different applied potentials over the Au (111) cathode. Using a multiscale modeling approach, we demonstrate that, under realistic electrocatalytic conditions, the formation of a dense EDL over the cathode hampers the diffusion of benzyl halides toward the electrode surface. A combination of classical molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations reveals the most favorable benzyl halide electro-carboxylation pathway over the EDL that does not require direct substrate adsorption to the cathode surface. The dense EDL promotes the dissociative reduction of the benzyl halides via the outer-sphere electron transfer from the cathode surface to the electrolyte. Such a reduction mechanism results in a benzyl radical intermediate, which is then converted to benzyl anions in the EDL via an additional electron transfer step.</description>

      <description>Shubhajit Das, Rub&#233;n Laplaza, J. Terence Blaskovits, Cl&#233;mence Corminb&#339;uf, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399174013

                Frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs), featuring reactive combinations of Lewis acids and Lewis bases, have been utilized for myriad metal-free homogeneous catalytic processes. Immobilizing the active Lewis sites to a solid support, especially to porous scaffolds, has shown great potential to ameliorate FLP catalysis by circumventing some of its inherent drawbacks, such as poor product separation and catalyst recyclability. Nevertheless, designing immobilized Lewis pair active sites (LPASs) is challenging due to the requirement of placing the donor and acceptor centers in appropriate geometric arrangements while maintaining the necessary chemical environment to perform catalysis, and clear design rules have not yet been established. In this work, we formulate simple guidelines to build highly active LPASs for direct catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 through a large-scale screening of a diverse library of 25,000 immobilized FLPs. The library is built by introducing boron-containing acidic sites in the vicinity of the existing basic nitrogen sites of the organic linkers of metal&#8211;organic frameworks collected in a "top-down" fashion from the CoRE MOF 2019 database. The chemical and geometrical appropriateness of these LPASs for CO2 hydrogenation is determined by evaluating a series of simple descriptors representing the intrinsic strength (acidity and basicity) of the components and their spatial arrangement in the active sites. Analysis of the leading candidates enables the formulation of pragmatic and experimentally relevant design principles which constitute the starting point for further exploration of FLP-based catalysts for the reduction of CO2.</description>

      <description>Yihu Ke, Heng Xu, Xue Wang, Hai Liu, Hong Yuan, Journal of CO2 utilization. 83(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399107301

                A series of metal oxides, i.e., CuO&#12289;NiO&#12289;Co3O4&#12289;ZrO2&#12289;Al2O3, catalysts were prepared by hydrothermal method and evaluated in the production of glycerol carbonate by coupling of glycerol and CO2 under lower temperature. The results show that CuO showed the best catalytic performance (glycerol conversion and the glycerol carbonate selectivity were 89.0 % and 69.4 %, respectively) at 120 &#8451; under 3.0 MPa of CO2 for 5 h. This is the highest yield of glycerol carbonate using same mothed reported in the literature so far. The structures, morphologies and surface properties of the catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption-desorption, Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Temperature programmed desorption (TPD). It is speculated that the high catalytic activity of CuO mainly depends on its unique structure and acid-base physicochemical properties. In addition, the CuO catalyst was used 7 times without obvious deactivation, which suggesting this catalysis has excellent reusability.</description>

                This research aims to analyze the efficiency of triangular and trapezoidal membership functions in forecasting CO2, N2O, and CH4 emissions in Indian smart cities. Over 10-years, emissions data for these gases were collected and used to determine membership values for both functions. The study evaluated the performance of the membership functions using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values and percentage error analysis. The results indicated that the trapezoidal membership function provided more accurate results for CO2 and CH4 emissions, while the triangular membership function was more accurate for N2O emissions. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate membership functions tailored to specific gases to enhance emission forecast accuracy. The study emphasizes the significance of such insights for decision-makers, urban planners, and environmental agencies involved in emissions reduction measures and smart city development. However, further research is recommended to validate these findings and explore additional factors that may influence the performance of membership functions in emission prediction in smart cities. In conclusion, this project offers a comprehensive analysis of triangular and trapezoidal membership functions&#8217; accuracy in predicting emissions in Indian smart cities, emphasizing the crucial factors.</description>

                Summary ChatGPT This paper focuses on the vital task of quickly identifying potential subsurface locations for carbon storage, a key aspect in combating climate change. It highlights the increasing significance of geoscience in the energy transition, especially in the context of carbon capture and storage (CCS). The major challenges in CCS involve the detailed screening and characterization of geological formations suitable for CO2 storage, a process essential for environmental and practical reasons. The main aim of the paper is to introduce a new method that utilizes advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and seismic interpretation to transform the process of subsurface characterization. Traditional seismic interpretation methods are reliable but slow and prone to human bias, leading to delays in meeting CO2 reduction goals. The proposed AI-driven technique offers unbiased, accurate, and faster seismic interpretation, enhancing site selection efficiency. The paper is structured to initially explain the technical details of the AI-driven seismic interpretation method. It then examines the Smeaheia case study in the North Sea, focusing on aspects such as horizon extraction, cap rock characterization, and fault analysis. Lastly, it explores the wider implications of this AI-based method for future carbon storage selection efforts.</description>

                The physicochemical properties of any material undergo drastic change during reduction of size of particles, particularly at the nanometer region. A large number of possibilities open up in several fields of research and technology. The special properties of nanomaterials made it suitable for different applications. One of the significant challenges faced by the world is the environmental pollution due to released gases from industries, household, and other sources in the form of gas, liquid, and the dispersed materials. Nanomaterials, having high surface area, adjustable properties, particularly those having porosity, are known to adsorb a variety of gaseous substances. Discovery of single-layer graphene at the University of Manchester in 2004 has triggered intense interests in 2D materials in broad fields of science such as chemistry, physics, and material science. Unique properties of 2D materials such as infinitesimal thickness, molecular sieving ability along with good thermal and chemical stability make them ideal building blocks for developing the new generation of high-performance gas and liquid separation membranes. Beyond graphene and its derivatives, abundant 2D nanomaterials such as metal-organic frameworks, transitional metal dichalcogenides, covalent organic frameworks, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), and MXenes have been discovered during recent past. The chapter will discuss various aspects of the removal of gas including the underlying mechanisms. As an example, h-BN adsorbs CO2 very loosely. Interestingly, DFT calculation results indicate that the injection of extra electron into the h-BN nanoadsorbent dramatically increases the adsorption of CO2 via a charge-induced chemisorption interaction. When the extra charge is released, there is a spontaneous release of CO2.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Production by Steam Reforming of Ethanol and Dry Reforming of Methane with CO2 on Ni/Vermiculite: Stability Improvement via Acid or Base Treatment of the Support</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29112575</link>
      <description>Hanane Mahir, Abdellah Benzaouak, Farah Mesrar, Adnane El Hamidi, M. El Kacimi, Luca Consentino, Leonarda Francesca Liotta, Molecules/Molecules online/Molecules annual. 29(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399155977

                In this study, vermiculite was explored as a support material for nickel catalysts in two key processes in syngas production: dry reforming of methane with CO2 and steam reforming of ethanol. The vermiculite underwent acid or base treatment, followed by the preparation of Ni catalysts through incipient wetness impregnation. Characterization was conducted using various techniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM&#8211;EDS, FTIR, and temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR). TG-TD analyses were performed to assess the formation of carbon deposits on spent catalysts. The Ni-based catalysts were used in reaction tests without a reduction pre-treatment. Initially, raw vermiculite-supported nickel showed limited catalytic activity in the dry reforming of methane. After acid (Ni/VTA) or base (Ni/VTB) treatment, vermiculite proved to be an effective support for nickel catalysts that displayed outstanding performance, achieving high methane conversion and hydrogen yield. The acidic treatment improved the reduction of nickel species and reduced carbon deposition, outperforming the Ni over alkali treated support. The prepared catalysts were also evaluated in ethanol steam reforming under various conditions including temperature, water/ethanol ratio, and space velocity, with acid-treated catalysts confirming the best performance.</description>

                This study proposes a straightforward strategy utilizing metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to obtain efficient electrocatalysts for synthesizing C2 products (C2H4 and C2H5OH) via a CO2 reduction reaction. Cu-MOF-74 was chosen as the precursor, while copper oxide nanoparticles were obtained through a calcination method. During the calcination process, by controlling the calcination conditions, the porous structure of the MOF framework was successfully retained, leading to CuO-400 with a high catalytic activity and C2 production efficiency. Compared to CuO-n formed by the calcination of Cu(NO3)2, CuO-400 derived from MOFs exhibits a 1.6 times higher C2 activity as an electrocatalytic material at &#8722;1.15 V vs. RHE.</description>

      <title>Dynamic performance and control analysis of supercritical CO2 brayton cycle for solid oxide fuel cell waste heat recovery</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2024.123556</link>
      <description>Jiancong Chen, Song Tan, E Jiaqiang, Gaoliang Liao, Feng Zhang, Applied thermal engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399220591

                Due to the high-temperature operation of solid oxide fuel cell, recovering its exhaust waste heat is worthwhile. The supercritical CO2 cycle features low compression power consumption and high thermal efficiency, making it a promising power cycle. Therefore, this paper adopts the supercritical CO2 recompression cycle as the bottom cycle, combined with solid oxide fuel cell to form a joint system, further improving energy utilization. Given the long temperature response time of the solid oxide fuel cell and the variability of its exhaust waste heat with load changes, this paper innovatively proposes establishing an integrated dynamic model of the joint system, instead of directly providing heat source flow and temperature changes as in traditional research, to more accurately study the dynamic response of the cycle during solid oxide fuel cell startup and load variations. Based on this, a control strategy utilizing inventory control is proposed, and the feasibility of the control effect is verified. The research results indicate that the uncontrolled cycle may lead to safety issues with a significant increase in turbine inlet temperature when solid oxide fuel cell load increases. Under the control strategy, the turbine inlet temperature and main compressor inlet temperature are rapidly stabilized at the target values. The controlled cycle achieves higher efficiency compared to the uncontrolled cycle, particularly prominent during solid oxide fuel cell load reduction, with an efficiency increase of approximately 5.23%.</description>

      <title>Cellulase-assisted refining in a paperboard mill: avoided emissions from energy savings. A case study of a Finnish paperboard mill.</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clet.2024.100760</link>
      <description>Olli Saira, Crystal Vauhkonen, Cleaner engineering and technology. 20(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399035724

                The 2023 being on its way to be the warmest year in the 174-year global surface temperature history it is becoming more and more evident how crucial it is to break the linkage between economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions. The pulp and paper industry is highly energy intensive industry sector. It is the fourth largest industrial energy user and currently produces approximately 1.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. While the demand for paper and paperboard products keeps rising, it is essential for the industry to find energy efficient solutions for reducing the environmental impact of the pulp and paper products. 80% of the progress in energy efficiency in Finnish paper mills is due to improved technology and more optimal operational modes. Optimizing existing processes has bigger effect on energy efficiency than closing old and starting new paper mills. Pulp refining is one of the most energy intense steps in the paperboard production, representing 15% - 18% of the total energy consumption of a paper mill. The effect of a commercial cellulase enzyme product was evaluated for energy savings and avoided emissions in the refining process of a paperboard mill. Data from a paperboard line using Bleached Softwood Kraft Pulp (BSKP) from a separate pulp mill was provided by a Finnish paperboard mill containing production runs both with and without commercial cellulase product ECOPULP&#174; R. Data was collected from the mill automation system to evaluate and compare a refining capacity restricted run and a run that was not refining capacity restricted. Analysis of the data showed a reduction of refining energy by approximately 16% - 17% when the cellulase enzyme was used. This corresponds to 2 kg of CO2 emissions avoided per tonne of pulp refined when calculated using the Finnish average electricity emissions intensity in 2022. Use of the cellulase enzyme enabled the refining results that could not have been reached with the bare mechanical refining capacity of the mill. Cellulases can be efficient processing aids in pulp refining. The reduction of required mechanical refining and electrical power to run the refiners to achieve the required freeness can significantly affect the carbon footprint of the paperboard products, whereas the negative impact of emissions from enzyme production is negligible. Reduction of CO2 emissions is especially significant in the areas where the electricity mix used for the production is based heavily on fossil fuels.</description>

      <title>Techno-Economic and Environmental Analyses of an Integrated Liquefied Natural Gas/Allam&#8211;Fetvedt Cycle/Air Separation Unit Complex</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17112663</link>
      <description>Daniel H. Chen, P S Shetty, Song Wang, Veeracharyulu Nellipudi, Farah Nora Aznieta Abdul Aziz, Qiang Xu, Gevorg Sargsyan, Energies. 17(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399172602

                The natural gas (NG)-powered compressors/engines used in liquified natural gas (LNG) plants are a major source of methane emission. The Allam&#8211;Fetvedt cycle (AFC), an oxyfuel, carbon-neutral, high-efficiency power plant, generates pipeline-grade CO2. This work performed novel process modeling, economic analysis, and greenhouse gas emissions analysis for a heat-integrated, electrified LNG/AFC/air separation unit (ASU) complex (LAA), then compared it to standalone LNG and AFC/ASU plants (baseline) as well as an LNG plant electrified with AFC/ASU without heat integration. The low-grade heat generated from compressors of the LNG plant can enhance the AFC net power output by 7.1%. Utilizing the nitrogens cold energy reduces the compressor power requirement by 1.6%. In the integrated LAA complex, not only are GHG emissions avoided, but the energy efficiencies are also improved for both the LNG plant and the AFC power plant. A cash flow analysis of LAA was performed over a 20-year period with 5%, 7%, and 10% discount rates and three levels of LNG prices. The 45Q CO2 credit of USD 85/T as stipulated by the recent Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 has been incorporated. The results clearly indicate the economic and environmental benefits of the proposed electrification and heat/power integration.</description>

      <title>Polymer-Assisted WAG Injection Improves CO2 Flow Properties in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/0624-0083-jpt</link>
      <description>Chris Carpenter, Journal of petroleum technology. 76(06)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399269512

                _ This article, written by JPT Technology Editor Chris Carpenter, contains highlights of paper SPE 215024, &#8220;Polymer-Assisted Water-Alternating-Gas for Improving CO2 Flow Properties in Porous Media,&#8221; by Mohsen M. Yegane, SPE, Delft University of Technology and the Dutch Polymer Institute; Thijs van Wieren, SPE, Delft University of Technology; and Ali Fadili, Shell, et al. The paper has not been peer reviewed. _ CO2 flow in porous media is vital for both enhanced oil recovery and underground carbon storage. For improving CO2 mobility control and improved reservoir sweep efficiency, water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection often has been applied. The effectiveness of WAG diminishes, however, because of the presence of microscale reservoir heterogeneity that results in an early breakthrough of gas. In the complete paper, the authors propose polymer-assisted WAG (PA-WAG) as an alternative method to reduce gas mobility and the mobility of the aqueous phase, consequently improving the performance of WAG. In this method, high-molecular-weight water-soluble polymers are added to the water slug. Introduction Recently, PA-WAG has received attention as a method to mitigate early gas breakthrough and gravity segregation during WAG injection. However, the flow mechanisms in PA-WAG injection in porous media remain poorly understood. In particular, no experimental study exists to the authors&#8217; knowledge that demonstrates in-situ visualization and discusses how PA-WAG can improve the gravity override and early gas breakthrough of WAG. The objective of this study is to demonstrate experimentally the feasibility of PA-WAG by conducting a series of X-ray computed tomography (CT) -aided coreflood experiments. To this end, coreflood experiments in Bentheimer cores using different injection schemes (CO2 and polymer injection, WAG injection, and PA-WAG injection) were conducted. The aim of CT scanning during the coreflood experiments was to map the phase saturations at different times of injection. Using dual-energy CT scanning, a reduction in gravity override could be visualized, and the CO2 breakthrough was delayed when PA-WAG was used. Experiments Table 1 of the complete paper presents the various chemical components that were used in this study. The coreflood experiments were performed using Bentheimer sandstone cores. Bentheimer cores have high permeabilities and a homogeneous mineralogy. The porosity of the core samples was measured using CT scanning. To introduce the aqueous phases into the core, a dual-cylinder pump was used. The core, core holder, and heating sleeve were placed in a fixed horizontal position on the CT bench because vertical scanning led to undesirable artifacts and yielded no meaningful insights. Fraction-collector sampling was used to collect effluents at the outlet at various time intervals. CO2 was injected into the system by a mass-flow controller sourced from a dedicated CO2 supply. The pump indirectly introduced both the oleic phase during primary drainage stages and the polymer solution used for secondary or tertiary recovery by means of a transfer vessel. The pressure drop across various sections of the core was measured using four pressure transducers. Pressure and temperature measurements were recorded at 10-second intervals. Four coreflood experiments were conducted in this study. As mentioned, all experiments were performed at pressures and temperatures of 20&#177;1 bar and 40&#177;1&#176;C.</description>

                In recent years, the construction industry has been increasingly focused on finding solutions to improve infrastructure and building performance while fulfilling environmental requirements. One area of focus is the production of cementitious composites, which currently produce high CO2 emissions. However, there are adaptable strategies for decarbonising the cement sector, including nanomaterials like graphene and graphene-related materials (GRM). GRM enhances the lifespan and adds innovative properties to cementitious composites. This study pioneers the application of few-layer graphene (FLG) in cementitious composites, resulting in a notable 94% reduction in electrical resistance and a 55% increase in thermal conductivity. This novel approach can significantly elevate the multifunctionality and performance attributes of cementitious materials, furthering sustainable construction practices.</description>

                As cement is the primary cause of CO2 emission, an attempt is made to replace the cement and it is done by replacing the cement with GGBS and silica fume along with activators such as sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide. By enrolling such materials in concrete, it will ensure the reduction of environmental consequences. This research is done by replacing of the cement with GGBS and silica fume without involving any type of admixtures. And it is done for M 30 grade with varying GGBS i.e., 90%, 80%, 70% and 60%. And to accelerate the pozzolanic effect, silica fume is added in diverse proportions i.e., 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%. Sodium hydroxide is kept constant throughout. Specimens were prepared for testing and ambient curing of 7 &amp; 28 days has done. Tests such as compressive, split-tensile and flexural strength test are performed to obtain the mechanical behaviour of the concrete.</description>

                Slag is a significant by-product generated in large quantities during metallurgical processes involved in the production of ferrous and nonferrous metals. Due to the chemical compositions and processing feature, various slags can be recycled into cement clinker in large quantities. This chapter reviews several types of slag and their contribution to the sustainable development of cement industry. The processing of cement clinker made with various slag is discussed, and the factors influencing clinker feature are presented. The effect of slag on the clinker mineralogical compositions, hydration feature, and mechanical properties is thereafter assessed. Since there are various elements presented in the slag, which could exert a detrimental effect on the cement properties, the stabilization mechanism and efficiency is discussed. With the industrialization and increased requirement for CO2 reduction, recycling various slags into cement clinker would be the route one must take for both metallurgical and cement field.</description>

                Light olefins, crucial feedstocks in the chemical industry, are projected to reach a market size of USD 475.8 million by 2027. Traditional methods for producing light olefins, such as cracking and the Fischer&#8211;Tropsch process, are energy-intensive and heavily reliant on fossil fuels. These production methods contribute significantly to environmental issues, emitting approximately 400 million tons of CO2 annually. Integrating solar energy into the olefin synthesis process presents a promising avenue for enhancing sustainability and efficiency. Recent research reveals the potential of utilizing solar energy to activate light-alkanes and COx, enabling solar olefin production via dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and reduction reactions. This review overviews recent advancements and evaluates the prospects of solar energy utilization in olefin synthesis, emphasizing innovative approaches and their potential implications.</description>

      <title>Large potential of strengthening the land carbon sink in China through anthropogenic interventions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scib.2024.05.037</link>
      <description>Xu Yue, Hao Zhou, Yang Cao, Hong Liao, Xiaofei Lu, Zhen Yu, Wenping Yuan, Zhu Li, Yadong Lei, Stephen Sitch, J&#252;rgen Knauer, Huijun Wang, Science Bulletin. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399143230

                The terrestrial ecosystem in China mitigates 21%-45% of the national contemporary fossil fuel CO2 emissions every year. Maintaining and strengthening the land carbon sink is essential for reaching China's target of carbon neutrality. However, this sink is subject to large uncertainties due to the joint impacts of climate change, air pollution, and human activities. Here, we explore the potential of strengthening land carbon sink in China through anthropogenic interventions, including forestation, ozone reduction, and litter removal, taking advantage of a well-validated dynamic vegetation model and meteorological forcings from 16 climate models. Without anthropogenic interventions, considering Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) scenarios, the land sink is projected to be 0.26-0.56 Pg C a-1 at 2060, to which climate change contributes 0.06-0.13 Pg C a-1 and CO2 fertilization contributes 0.08-0.44 Pg C a-1 with the stronger effects for higher emission scenarios. With anthropogenic interventions, under a close-to-neutral emission scenario (SSP1-2.6), the land sink becomes 0.47-0.57 Pg C a-1 at 2060, including the contributions of 0.12 Pg C a-1 by conservative forestation, 0.07 Pg C a-1 by ozone pollution control, and 0.06-0.16 Pg C a-1 by 20% litter removal over planted forest. This sink can mitigate 90%-110% of the residue anthropogenic carbon emissions at 2060, providing a solid foundation for the carbon neutrality in China.</description>

      <title>Influence of quality and quantity of crop residues on organic carbon dynamics and microbial activity in soil</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.25252/se/2024/243394</link>
      <description>Tahseen Afzal, Abdul Wakeel, Sardar Alam Cheema, Javed Iqbal, Muhammad Sanaullah, Soil &amp; environment. 43(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399264841

                An incubation study investigated the decomposition patterns, microbial activities, soil aggregates distribution, and soil organic carbon (SOC) contents, using four crop residues; wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rice (Oryza sativa L.), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), and maize (Zea mays L.), at low and high rates (10 and 20 g kg&#8211;1). An average increase of about 35% in cumulative C-CO2 emissions and 26% in soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) was observed at high residue rates as compared to low rates. A positive and strong correlation (0.96) was found between C-CO2 emissions and MBC, and the effect of residue quality on decomposition was found to be less at high rates. The relative reduction in C-CO2 emissions by adding rice residues may be due to their high silica content. Differences in extracellular enzyme activities (EEA) with different residues indicated the effect of residue quality on microbial activities. Cotton residues increased &#946;-glucosidase and chitinase activities by 41 and 38%, respectively, at high rates than at low rates. High maize residues also markedly increased chitinase activity by 41%, implying higher N cycling and fungal prevalence. Acid phosphatase activity was found to increase by about 25 to 32% with high rice and wheat residues, respectively. Higher EEA at high residues input likely reflected the microbial nutritional limitations. Crop residues raised SOC content from 0.7 under control to 1.0% at low residues input but not at high input. Increased macro-aggregates fraction at high residues input may be attributed to higher microbial activities. In summary, high residues input can minimize residue biochemical quality&#8217;s effect on decomposition, with no further increase in SOC content. While a positive effect on the soil MBC, but not on the SOC content, was observed at high residue input, suggesting moderation in the additions of organic amendments is key for SOC buildup. Crop residues, added at 10 g kg&#8211;1, may help maintain a positive SOC balance in the arid agroecosystems by moderating higher microbial activities and soil respiration.</description>

                Abstract The &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratio is a good indicator of the combustion efficiency of carbon-containing fuels, and can be useful to assess the combustion efficiency on a regional scale. In this study, we analyzed in-situ observations of CO2 and CO concentrations from 2011 to 2021 at the Station for Observing Regional Processes of the Earth System (SORPES), in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of eastern China, and calculated the &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratio to investigate the combustion efficiency in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. Furthermore, we used a Lagrangian particle dispersion model WRF-FLEXPART to evaluate the contribution of each emission sources to the observed &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratio. We found that the observed &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratio showed a persistent decreasing trend of 1.0 ppb/ppm per year and decreased ~47.9% during this period, illustrating an evident improvement in the combustion efficiency in the YRD region. The improvement of the combustion efficiency is a result of China&#8217;s Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan announced in 2013. However, the decrease of &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratio slowed down from 1.3 ppb/ppm per year during 2011-2016 to 0.6 ppb/ppm per year during 2017-2021. The simulation results reveal that the slowdown of the decrease in the &#916;CO/&#916;CO2 ratios can be explained by the slowing improvement of combustion efficiency in steel source in the industry sector. Our results verify the effectiveness of emission reduction efforts in YRD region and highlight the necessity of long-term observations of CO2 and CO.&amp;#xD;</description>

                Lithium significantly reduces the temperature of clinker melt formation and its viscosity, and sulfur promotes the formation of monoclinic alite modification M1, which guarantees higher mechanical strength of cement compared to cement with M3 modification. By a suitable combination of both dopants, it is possible to reduce the burning temperature of clinker by 100 &#8211; 150 &#8451; and, as it was found, to increase the mechanical strength of the cement prepared from this clinker. The initial strengths of this cement show an increase of up to 100% compared to the conventional cement CEM I. Lowering the burning temperature of the clinker would lead to a reduction in the energy demand of the production of the main intermediate product for cement production. At the same time, it is also one of the possibilities to reduce CO2 emissions in cement production, which is one of the current priority goals. X-ray diffraction analysis, optical microscopy, electron microscopy and microanalysis were used for the research.</description>

                The first step to achieving an energy transition is partially substituting fossil fuels with other more environmentally friendly alternatives, such as hydrogen gas. The current research aims to evaluate the influence of hydrogen in a diesel generator fueled with rice bran biodiesel. The above encourages the use of hydrogen and biodiesel production from residual raw material. For the development of the research, a diesel engine bench was used, which operated in five load conditions: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%, and was fed with three fuels: -100%, RB-10%, and RB-10% + H2(30%). The results show that the mixture RB-10% + H2(30%) causes a 3.14% reduction in BSFC and a 3.26% increase in energy conversion efficiency. In addition, it is observed that a 9.90%, 12.57%, and 10.99% decrease in HC, CO, and smoke opacity emissions compared to pure diesel. On the other hand, the mixture RB-10% + H2(30%) reduces by 4.44%, 5.07%, and 7.06% the environmental, social, and ecological impact due to CO2, HC, and CO emissions, as well as a 3.93% reduction in engine operating cost compared to RB-10% biodiesel. In general, hydrogen injection is a promising alternative to promote the use of rice bran biodiesel due to its increased performance characteristics and reduced pollutant emissions without the need to modify the engine.</description>

      <title>High night temperature stress on rice (Oryza sativa) &#8211; insights from phenomics to physiology. A review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1071/fp24057</link>
      <description>Awais Riaz, Julie Thomas, Hafiz Haider Ali, Muhammad Saqlain Zaheer, N. Ahmad, Andy Pereira, Functional plant biology. 51(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399194804

                Rice (Oryza sativa) faces challenges to yield and quality due to urbanisation, deforestation and climate change, which has exacerbated high night temperature (HNT). This review explores the impacts of HNT on the physiological, molecular and agronomic aspects of rice growth. Rise in minimum temperature threatens a potential 41% reduction in rice yield by 2100. HNT disrupts rice growth stages, causing reduced seed germination, biomass, spikelet sterility and poor grain development. Recent findings indicate a 4.4% yield decline for every 1&#176;C increase beyond 27&#176;C, with japonica ecotypes exhibiting higher sensitivity than indica. We examine the relationships between elevated CO2, nitrogen regimes and HNT, showing that the complexity of balancing positive CO2 effects on biomass with HNT challenges. Nitrogen enrichment proves crucial during the vegetative stage but causes disruption to reproductive stages, affecting grain yield and starch synthesis. Additionally, we elucidate the impact of HNT on plant respiration, emphasising mitochondrial respiration, photorespiration and antioxidant responses. Genomic techniques, including CRISPR-Cas9, offer potential for manipulating genes for HNT tolerance. Plant hormones and carbohydrate enzymatic activities are explored, revealing their intricate roles in spikelet fertility, grain size and starch metabolism under HNT. Gaps in understanding genetic factors influencing heat tolerance and potential trade-offs associated with hormone applications remain. The importance of interdisciplinary collaboration is needed to provide a holistic approach. Research priorities include the study of regulatory mechanisms, post-anthesis effects, cumulative HNT exposure and the interaction between climate variability and HNT impact to provide a research direction to enhance rice resilience in a changing climate.</description>

      <title>Plasma Engineering toward Improving the Microwave-Absorbing/Shielding Feature of a Biomass-Derived Material</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c01046</link>

                During the past decade, ever-increasing electromagnetic pollution has excited a global concern. A sustainable resource, facile experimental scenario, fascinating reflection loss (RL), and broad efficient bandwidth are the substantial factors that intrigue researchers. This research led to the achievement of a brilliant microwave-absorbing material by treating pampas as biomass. The carbon-based microfibers attained by biowaste were treated by plasma under diverse environments to amplify their microwave-absorbing features. Moreover, a pyrolysis scenario was performed to compare the results. The reductive processes were performed by H2 plasma and carbonization. However, the CO2 plasma was performed to regulate the heteroatoms and defects. Interestingly, polystyrene (PS) was applied as a microwave-absorbing matrix. The aromatic rings existing in the absorbing medium establish electrostatic interactions, elevating interfacial polarization, and physical characteristics of PS augment the practical applications of the final product. The manipulated biomasses were characterized by Raman, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and diffuse reflection spectroscopy analyses. Eventually, the microwave-absorbing features were estimated by a vector network analyzer. The plasma-treated pampas under H2/Ar blended with PS gained a maximum RL of &#8722;90.65 dB at 8.79 GHz and an efficient bandwidth (RL &#8804; &#8722;10 dB) of 4.24 GHz with a thickness of 3.20 mm; meanwhile, plasma treatment under CO2 led to a maximum RL of 97.99 dB at 14.92 GHz and an efficient bandwidth of 7.74 GHz with a 2.05 mm thickness. Particularly, the biomass plasmolyzed under Ar covered the entire X and Ku bands with a thickness of 2.10 mm. Notably, total shielding efficiencies of the treated bioinspired materials were up to &#8776;99%, desirable for practical applications.</description>

                Abstract Managing waste materials from mining is of universal interest owing to its massive volume, ecological impacts, health hazards, and disposal challenges despite high operational costs. Advancements advocate for recycling mine waste to sustainably support construction. As the construction sector heavily consumes resources, utilizing mine waste from magnesite mines (MMW) in concrete has gained attention. This experimental study assesses the viability of substituting MMW for natural fine and coarse aggregates in self-compacting concrete (SCC) at intervals of 10% up to 50% by weight. Evaluations were done on fresh (slump flow, T50 slump, V-funnel, J-ring, L-box) and hardened (compressive, splitting tensile, and flexural strength) properties, along with microstructural features, cost, and CO2 emissions. The findings unveil that nearly all mixtures exhibit commendable performance, where mine waste is replaced for fine and coarse aggregates showcasing superior fresh and hardened properties, respectively. Fresh property results reveal the SF1 flow category with VF1 and VF2 viscosity types for the SCC mixtures. Moreover, these SCC mixtures observed substantial strength enhancements of approximately 10% to 15% in compressive, splitting tensile and flexural test results at 28 and 90 days. Microstructural analysis corroborates the observed strength outcomes, indicating a denser concrete matrix. Significant environmental and economic benefits were observed, including a notable 20% reduction in CO2 emissions and 17% cost savings. These findings underscore the potential of integrating MMW into SCC mixtures as a sustainable approach towards construction materials, offering both performance and environmental advantages.</description>

      <title>Decarbonizing polyamide textile production in China: Footprints and mitigation pathways from life cycle perspective</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2024.107705</link>

                Escalating demand for textiles has led to the entire supply chain contributing 8 % of global GHGs emissions. However, the carbon footprint (CF) and low carbon pathways of polyamide textile production remain ambiguous. Herein the CF of polyamide textile in China is evaluated using a "cradle to gate" life cycle system boundary allowing for comparison with other textile categories. To explore low carbon pathways of polyamide textile production, we introduce four groups of measures resulting in 12 scenarios. The CF of 1 kg polyamide textile is 35.37 kg CO2-eq, 1.38 and 3.91 times that of polyester and cotton textiles, respectively. Direct emissions from energy combustion, and indirect emissions from raw materials and energy production contribute 43.87 % and 56.13 % of the total CF. Emission reduction potentials vary from 51.37 % to 88.52 % across scenarios. These explored low carbon pathways should serve as references for achieving low and net zero emissions in the textile sector.</description>

                Using local materials is important for reduction of cost and CO2 emission. Dune sand is prevalent in Middle East but has not been widely used in concrete products. In UAE, for construction purposes, quartz sand, which was not available locally, was imported from the neighbour and European countries at relatively high cost. In this paper, we present our early results of our trials using UAE local dune sand to replace quartz sand for UHPC reinforced fibre. Natural dune sand was used directly without any pre-treatment. The dune sand is charaterised as reddish round to subrounded fine sand with 99% particles passing sieve 0.5mm. The chemical analysis results show that the silica content of the dune sand is 67%. Our initial compressive and flexural test results have shown that dune sand is highly suitable for UHPC hence normal concrete. The compressive strength and flexural strength are sufficient, suitable more many applications, suggesting that it can replace quart sand in concrete.</description>

      <title>Environmental and Economic Aspects of a Containership Engine Performance in Off-Design Conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/app14114634</link>

                A comprehensive thermodynamic model of the marine diesel engine in combination with the operating cost assessment is used in the decision-making process regarding the selection of the most favorable slow steaming speed. The influence of the number of cylinders and sailing speed on exhaust emissions, fuel consumption and operating costs is analyzed for the case of a containership sailing on a Trans-Pacific route. The engine simulation model was used for the calculation of engine fuel consumption, NOX and soot emissions. The operating costs and annual income were calculated through a fuel consumption correlation. The benefit of slow steaming is shown through the comparison of calculated data with the data calculated for the six-cylinder engine and the design speed of 23 knots. The highest reduction of 67.2% in CO2 and 93.3% in NOX emissions is achieved with the seven-cylinder engine at 15 knots, but the six-cylinder engine yields the highest increase in income per route of 6.2%. To comply with the proposed regulations for GHG emissions, the sailing speed should be reduced by at least 26%, which results in a decrease in the annual income by 24% compared to the design speed.</description>

      <title>ApIsoT: An IoT Function Aggregation Mechanism for Detecting Varroa Infestation in Apis mellifera Species</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture14060846</link>
      <description>Ana Isabel Caicedo Camayo, Martin Alexander Chaves Mu&#241;oz, Juan Carlos Corrales, Agriculture. 14(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399073556

                In recent years, the global reduction in populations of the Apis mellifera species has generated a worrying deterioration in the production of essential foods for human consumption. This phenomenon threatens food security, as it reduces the pollination of vital crops, negatively affecting the health and stability of ecosystems. The three main factors generating the loss of the bee population are industrial agriculture, climate changes, and infectious diseases, mainly those of parasitic origin, such as the Varroa destructor mite. This article proposes an IoT system that uses accessible, efficient, low-cost devices for beekeepers in developing countries to monitor hives based on temperature, humidity, CO2, and TVOC. The proposed solution incorporates nine-feature aggregation as a data preprocessing strategy to reduce redundancy and efficiently manage data storage on hardware with limited capabilities, which, combined with a machine learning model, improves mite detection. Finally, an evaluation of the energy consumption of the solution in each of its nodes, an analysis of the data traffic injected into the network, an assessment of the energy consumption of each implemented classification model, and, finally, a validation of the solution with experts is presented.</description>

      <title>Towards Comprehensive Uncertainty Quantification in Direct-Use Geothermal Systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3997/2214-4609.2024101678</link>
      <description>Alexandros Daniilidis, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399188773

                Summary The energy transition requires a reduction of CO2 emissions from anthropogenic activity. In Europe, heat amounts to 50% of the total gross energy consumption. In conduction-dominated geological settings, geothermal resources can supply renewable, baseload heat for direct uses, in almost all parts of Europe. In these settings, economic viability can be challenging and should be considered as coupled to the development of geothermal fields. The aim of this paper is to outline the way towards comprehensive uncertainty quantification. A methodology is proposed identifying three main categories of uncertainty sources to be evaluated based on three key performance indicators in a systematic approach. The sources of uncertainty include: a) subsurface characterization, b) development options and c) economics. The performance indicators are : i) cumulative energy generated, ii) system lifetime and iii) economic output. Each of the uncertainty sources and performance indicators are used to demonstrate the importance of a comprehensive approach to uncertainty quantification. Standardization and comprehensive analysis considering the combined uncertainty across the different uncertainty levels and over the key performance indicators is needed to enable more reliable and robust predictions of geothermal developments.</description>

                This comprehensive study examines sustainable tourisms multifaceted impacts on environmental conservation, economic development, and social equity. Through a series of analytical lenses, we assess how the tourism sectors carbon footprint can be significantly reduced by adopting low-carbon transportation and energy-efficient accommodations, leading to a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions. We explore biodiversity conservation efforts enhanced by sustainable tourism practices, resulting in a 25% improvement in biodiversity indices. Water resource management strategies highlight the importance of sustainable practices in reducing water usage by up to 30%. Economically, sustainable tourism acts as a catalyst for increasing tourist spending, job creation, and ensuring long-term economic resilience, with data indicating a 20% increase in per capita tourist expenditure in destinations with sustainable certifications. Socially, the paper delves into community participation, cultural preservation, and access inclusivity, showcasing how sustainable tourism fosters community satisfaction, cultural enrichment, and equitable benefits distribution. This paper underscores sustainable tourisms role as a critical lever for achieving environmental sustainability, economic vitality, and social justice.</description>

      <title>Reasonable Planning of King County's E-bus Replacement Plan</title>

                With the increasingly intensified global warming severe air pollutions, governments all over the world have begun or is right now looking for ways to fix the problem. Among all the solutions, sustainable urban transportation system is what many governments pay attention to because of their apparent contribution to the reduction in greenhouse gases emissions and pollutants. In this passage, we focus on the exact ecology impacts the promotion of e-buses will cause. On the other hand, the potential financial burdens the transitioning processes will bring are perceived by us in order to make a decent plan for the government to implement.For the first part of constructing the model to measure the ecology impact of transition in one area, we start with the identification of King County as a metropolitan area suitable for prediction. Then we collect information and data of its local bus fleet and e-bus transitioning plan, find out the exact number of each type of buses (diesel, hybrid and electric) around these years and the emissions of corresponding buses. We use both ARIMA and Least Squares Regression to predict the number these buses in the future until the year the local government aim to complete the plan but choose the result displayed by the better one. In this case, we obtain the data for emission of carbon dioxide, oxynitride and PM10 in each year and evaluate the ecological impact. At the same time, we predict the data for the emissions later if the bus fleet keep the same and observed over 90% of decline when we compare the value after transition to the control group.Afterwards, to estimate the financial cost, we identify the main parts involved in the processes of transitioning, classify them with one group of cost for long-term and the other for short-term---that is, changed as the plan is gradually implemented. We build models for each factor we identified and use Riemann Sum to unify the long-term and short-term costs. Based on the data we predict in problem one and from the local government&#8217;s website, we easily gain the financial implications of for about 50 million dollars in King County. Through the analysis of the government&#8217;s grant in other area, we roughly verify that 50 million dollars would be an acceptable cost.Finally, in our 10-year roadmap development, we explored further into the population distribution of King County and the existing traits for public transportation. Our starting point in this article is to classify the urban pattern into four types of bus operation routes, and then define the passenger flow from high to low. At the same time, we define the total number of vehicles that need to be replaced for different types to develop transportation replacement plans. Based on our assumptions, calculate the carrying capacity of each type of bus in line with the passenger flow. Eventually, it can be proven that the total carrying capacity of the bus meets the transportation needs of all King counties. Then apply to other regions.</description>

                This paper explores the new potential strategy of using fine recycled aggregates (fRA) derived from waste 3D printed concrete (3DPC) as a substitute for cement in additive manufacturing. This study hypothesizes that fRA can optimize mixture design, reduce cement content, and contribute to sustainable construction practices. Experimental programs were conducted to evaluate the fresh and hardened properties, printability window, and buildability of 3DPC mixes containing fRA. Mixes with replacement rates of cement with fRA by 10 vol%, 20 vol%, 30 vol%, 40 vol%, and 50 vol% were produced. A comprehensive experimental protocol consisting of rheological studies (static and dynamic yield stress), dynamic elastic modulus determination (first 24 h of hydration), flexural and compressive strengths (2 d and 28 d), and an open porosity test was performed. The obtained results were verified by printing tests. In addition, an economic and environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) of the mixes was performed. The results indicate that up to 50 vol% cement replacement with fRA is feasible, albeit with some technical drawbacks. While fRA incorporation enhances sustainability by reducing CO2 emissions and material costs, it adversely affects the printability window, green strength, setting time, and mechanical properties, particularly in the initial curing stages. Therefore, with higher replacement rates (above 20 vol%), potential optimization efforts are needed to mitigate drawbacks such as reduced green strength and buildability. Notably, replacement rates of up to 20 vol% can be successfully used without compromising the overall material properties or altering the mixture design. The LCA analysis shows that reducing the cement content and increasing the fRA addition results in a significant reduction in mix cost (up to 24%) and a substantial decrease in equivalent CO2 emissions (up to 48%). In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of fRA as a sustainable alternative to cement in 3D printed concrete.</description>

                This article analyzes the influence of driving maneuvers on a hybrid vehicle's energy consumption and emission rates. Employing data collected through OBD II and GPS technologies, route variables are meticulously documented following the EURO 6 standard, primarily for assessing pollutant levels within a Real Driving Emissions (RDE) cycle, facilitated by the use of a Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS). Throughout the study, we identify key variables that exhibit the strongest correlation with fuel consumption, including Longitudinal acceleration (Ax), Torque, Accelerator pedal open position (APS), and engine speed (RPM). These variables enable us to discern the Internal Combustion Engine's (ICE) operational conditions and devise a model that accurately estimates the rate of fuel consumption change concerning vehicle acceleration. Furthermore, we classify driving modes as ecological, RDE, or aggressive based on the State of Charge (SOC) of the vehicle. Our findings reveal that the type of driving conducted on the road and city altitude directly influence fuel consumption and emission factors (CO2, CO, HC, and NOx). Notably, we observe a remarkable 31.36% reduction in fuel consumption during ecological driving compared to aggressive driving.</description>

                Abstract The fate of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) under global warming stress is still unascertained. From this viewpoint, GIS conditions during the mid-Pliocene Warm Period (mPWP; 3.264-3.025 Ma), an interval often referred to as a close analogue of a near-future warmer globe, deserve special attention. Neodymium (Nd) and lead (Pb) isotope signatures of marine sediment cored off the southern Greenland margin record intense glacial erosion pulses on southern Greenland Precambrian terranes during this interval, accompanied by a strong reduction of deep contour currents, and following a near obliquity cycle (~ 41 ka) pacing. Despite the high atmospheric CO2 concentration (~ 400 ppmV) of the mPWP, cold spells were thus strong enough to allow for active ice growth over Greenland. The mPWP interval was marked by a reduced amplitude in the axial tilt oscillation of the Earth, thus low overall summer insolation conditions at high latitudes, a feature not anticipated in the near future. Therefore, if offering analogies with the near future of the Earth's climate, the mPWP interval cannot be seen as a genuine analogue specifically for predicting the fate of the GIS.</description>

                Background Health care is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, leading to climate change and public health harms. Changes are needed to improve the environmental sustainability of health-care practices, but such changes should not sacrifice patient outcomes or financial sustainability. Alternative dosing strategies that reduce the frequency with which specialty drugs are administered, without sacrificing patient outcomes, are an attractive possibility for improving environmental sustainability. We sought to inform environmentally sustainable cancer care by estimating and comparing the environmental and financial effects of alternative, clinically equivalent strategies for pembrolizumab administration. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis using a cohort of patients from the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) in the USA who received one or more pembrolizumab doses between May 1, 2020, and Sept 30, 2022. Using baseline, real-world administration of pembrolizumab, we generated simulated pembrolizumab use data under three near-equivalent counterfactual pembrolizumab administration strategies defined by combinations of weight-based dosing, pharmacy-level vial sharing and dose rounding, and extended-interval dosing (ie, every 6 weeks). For each counterfactual dosing strategy, we estimated greenhouse gas emissions related to pembrolizumab use across the VHA cohort using a deterministic environmental impact model that estimated greenhouse gas emissions due to patient travel, drug manufacture, and medical waste as the primary outcome measure. Findings We identified 7813 veterans who received at least one dose of pembrolizumab-containing therapy in the VHA during the study period. 59 140 pembrolizumab administrations occurred in the study period, of which 46 255 (78&#183;2%) were dosed at 200 mg every 3 weeks, 12 885 (21&#183;8%) at 400 mg every 6 weeks, and 14 955 (25&#183;3%) were coadministered with infusional chemotherapies. Adoption of weight-based, extended-interval pembrolizumab dosing (4 mg/kg every 6 weeks) and pharmacy-level stewardship strategies (ie, dose rounding and vial sharing) for all pembrolizumab infusions would have resulted in 24&#183;7% fewer administration events than baseline dosing (44 533 events vs 59 140 events) and an estimated 200 metric tons less CO2 emitted per year as a result of pembrolizumab use within the VHA (650 tons vs 850 tons of CO2, a relative reduction of 24%), largely due to reductions in distance travelled by patients to receive treatment. Similar results were observed when weight-based and extended-interval dosing were applied only to pembrolizumab monotherapy and pembrolizumab in combination with oral therapies. Interpretation Alternative pembrolizumab administration strategies might have environmental advantages over the current dosing and compounding paradigms. Specialty medication dosing can be optimised for health-care spending and environmental sustainability without sacrificing clinical outcomes. Funding None.</description>

                Copper and palladium exhibit excellent catalytic performance for the electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR). Here, a PdxCu4&#8211;x (x = 2, 3) cluster was supported on CeO2 with different sites to form three kinds of novel nanocatalysts, namely, Pd2Cu2/CeO2, Pd3Cu/CeO2 (Pd&#8211;Pd), and Pd3Cu/CeO2 (Pd&#8211;Cu). Based on density functional theory, the catalytic performance and selective mechanisms were studied systematically. During the process of CO2RR, *CO was hydrogenated to produce deeply reduced products such as CH4 or CH3OH due to its strong adsorption energies on all three catalysts (Pd3Cu/CeO2(Pd&#8211;Pd) for 0.95 eV, Pd3Cu/CeO2(Pd&#8211;Cu) for 0.89 eV, and Pd2Cu2/CeO2 for 1.22 eV). The overpotential to form the CH4 or CH3OH product can be changed by varying the atomic ratio or anchoring sites of PdxCu4&#8211;x clusters on CeO2. In particular, the CO2RR on Pd2Cu2/CeO2 showed the lowest overpotentiontial (&#8722;0.60 eV) compared to the other two Pd3Cu/CeO2 catalysts. This study extends the family of CO2RR catalysts and the application scenarios of bimetallic catalysts, which provides new insights into the design and preparation of composite nanocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Hybrid Power-Heating System in a Single-Family Building, along with Ecological Aspects of the Operation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17112601</link>
      <description>Grzegorz Woroniak, J. Piotrowska-Woroniak, Anna Woroniak, E. Owczarek, K. Giza, Energies. 17(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399083477

                This study evaluates a hybrid heating system in a single-family building in northeastern Poland, which has a temperate continental climate. The analysis covers two heating seasons in 2021/2022 and 2022/2023. The hybrid heating system includes an air heat pump HPA&#8211;08 CS Plus with a heating power of 8.2 kW (AHP), a condensing gas boiler VC146/5&#8211;5 with a power of 14 kW (GB&#8211;Condens.), and a solid fuel boiler with a power of 11 kW for central heating. Additionally, hot water is heated by a Basic 270 (DHW&#8217;s AHP) air&#8211;water heat pump with a power of 2 kW, utilizing a tank with a capacity of 270 dm3 equipped with two heating coils. The building&#8217;s average electricity consumption is around 5400 kWh/year. A 4.96 kWp photovoltaic installation is installed on the building&#8217;s roof at a 40&#176; angle towards the south to supplement the hybrid system. The study aims to assess whether the PV installation can adequately cover the energy needs of the hybrid heat source for heating and hot water. Furthermore, the study calculates the emission of pollutants (CO2, SOx, NOx, CO, and PM10) into the atmosphere. The total annual electricity production from PV installations was 5444.9 kWh in 2021/2022 and 5684.8 kWh in 2022/2023. The excess electricity was stored in the PGE power grid as per the Prosumer settlement rules. The installed PV installation is sufficient to power the following devices annually: AHP, DHW&#8217;s AHP, and GB&#8211;Condens. However, the daily electricity production from the PV installation is not enough to cover the energy needs of the heat pump for heating during the cold months in Poland (I&#8211;III, XI&#8211;XII). It can meet the power needs of a PC all year round and can also be stored during the summer months, for example, in energy warehouses or by directly storing it in the PGE power grid. The use of the PV installation resulted in an average reduction in pollutant emissions into the atmosphere: CO2&#8212;94.1%, SOx&#8212;91.8%, NOx&#8212;95.6%, CO&#8212;9.7%, and PM10&#8212;32.1%.</description>

                Summary This study explores pathways to leverage potential opportunities to deploy hydrogen co-firing and draw a roadmap for the power plant to produce hydrogen while increasing use of renewables and reducing carbon emissions to achieve decarbonization of this sector. For this, a thorough techno-commercial assessment framework for co-firing hydrogen in gas power plants to reduce carbon emission is developed supported by energy transition strategy, process engineering modeling, flow simulation, and economics modeling to connect the different components involved in the studied hydrogen value chain. The conclusions drawn from the study show that: (i) to meet these objectives will require a full integration of multiple technologies packaged into a viable hydrogen value chain to deliver the required hydrogen volume; (ii) the hydrogen co-firing in the studied gas power plants will only contribute to a portion of the CO2 emission targets; (iii) a further reduction to meet the net zero target will be achieved by introducing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies combined with the development of multiple renewable energy projects, such as large-scale solar projects. Finally, this study strongly confirms that technologies developed for oil and gas can easily be adapted to energy transition strategies for hydrogen for power generation.</description>

      <title>Reuse of Steel Residue in Polypropylene Matrices for the Production of Plastic Wood, Aiming at Decarbonization</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114505</link>
      <description>Let&#237;cia Santos Ribeiro, Ana L&#250;cia Nazareth da Silva, Mayara Am&#225;rio, Carina Mariane Stolz, Assed Haddad, Dieter Boer, Sustainability. 16(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399055244

                According to a 2024 World Economic Forum survey, climate change is the primary concern for the future. To address these challenges, adaptation measures and actions to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions are necessary. Emissions from the waste management sector rank as the seventh-largest contributor to global emissions. Efforts are underway to decarbonize steel processes and promote waste reuse. &#8220;Fluff&#8221;, generated during ferrous scrap processing, poses reuse challenges due to its characteristics. This study evaluates the production of wood&#8211;plastic composites using polypropylene and &#8220;Fluff&#8221; to address environmental concerns and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Methodologically, waste characterization preceded the extrusion of waste and polypropylene blends at varying compositions. The resulting materials were pelletized, molded, and characterized. CO2 emission reductions from waste diversion from landfills were assessed under two scenarios. In Scenario 1, emissions totaled 19,054 tons/year, while in Scenario 2, with gas capture and utilization, emissions reached 10,617 tons/year for 20,000 tons of waste annually. Composite characterization revealed favorable properties, suggesting viability for wood&#8211;plastic production. This approach supports industrial decarbonization and circular economy initiatives in the steel sector.</description>

      <title>Circular Economy Approach: Recycling Toner Waste in Cement-Based Construction Materials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114707</link>
      <description>R.J. Ring, Gisela Cordoba, Natalia Delbianco, Carla Priano, Viviana F&#225;tima Rahhal, Sustainability. 16(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399208932

                Based on a waste generated survey by companies in the area of the city of Bahia Blanca (Argentina), the possibility of incorporating part of them in a Portland cement matrix was examined. Among the waste is toner (TW), which is obtained from cartridges used in photocopiers, laser printers, and faxes. This paper aims to analyze the physical and mechanical properties of cement pastes and mortars using toner as a Portland cement replacement compared to a reference sample without toner. The mixes were made with 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 wt.% replacement of cement by toner, and it was measured the flow, normal consistency, setting time, calorimetry, and Frattini test in pastes and mechanical strengths in mortars employing standardized tests. Also, an analysis of the leachate in the curing water was carried out after 56 days to look for contaminating materials. The replacement of up to 5% cement with toner did not produce substantial alterations in the final setting time or mechanical properties. No heavy metals were found in the leachate, so TW can be immobilized in a cementitious matrix as it does not cause leaching above the established limits. Therefore, TW from a local industry can be used in construction materials and could contribute to a reduction of up to 14% of CO2 emissions with a cement replacement of 15% in cement-based materials.</description>

      <title>Modulation of mitochondrial dynamism in kupffer cells impacts systemic metabolism</title>

      <description>F Fantini, Lorenzo Da Dalt, Annalisa Moregola, G B Vingiani, Monika Svecla, O. Terenghi, J. Nour, Rachele Bellini, Fabrizia Bonacina, Giuseppe Danilo Norata, Cardiovascular research. 120(Supplement_1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399136236

                Abstract Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources: Public Institution(s). Main funding source(s): University of Milan Background Kupffer Cells (KC) are hepatic resident macrophages that are essential for liver physiology and contribute to the development of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The liver of patients with NAFLD shows different expression of some key regulators of inner mitochondrial membrane fusion compared with healthy subjects, including OPA1 protein, which is a mitochondrial protein whose activity promotes mitochondrial fusion and positive modulation of oxidative phosphorylation. Aim Given that Kupffer Cells have both immune and metabolic roles, their mitochondria are critical for their and energy requirements and their functionality. This project aims to study how the inhibition of OPA1-driven mitochondrial fusion affects immune-metabolic response and progression of NAFLD by exploring the role of OPA1 in both a Standard and High-fat diet context. Methods mice selectively lacking OPA1 in Kupffer Cells were fed with either a Standard diet or a High-fat diet for 20 weeks. The metabolic phenotype was assessed by in vivo indirect calorimetry, measurement of plasma and tissue lipid profile, glucose and insulin sensitivity assays, and complete immunophenotype characterization. Single cell RNA sequencing was also performed to profile with higher resolution the impact of OPA1 deficiency on Kupffer Cell function and cross talk with other liver cells types within the hepatic niche. Results Under Standard diet conditions mice selectively lacking OPA1 in Kupffer Cells show a significant reduction in the KC1 pro-inflammatory subset, while the pro-resolutive KC2 increases significantly. In addition, mice lacking OPA1 in KCs show a metabolic preference towards carbohydrates, despite comparable energy expenditure, O2 consumption and CO2 production. The systemic immune profile was comparable between the two groups, with an expected reduction in KC total number under High-fat diet conditions, where no significant differences were observed between the two groups in plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, while a significant reduction in liver fibrosis was observed with liver histology. Conclusions Taken together these preliminary data suggest that OPA1-mediated inhibition of mitochondrial fusion in Kupffer Cells affects the systemic metabolic response under Standard diet with a reflection also on High-fat diet conditions, where systemic metabolism is comparable between the two groups, but the loss of OPA1 appears to influence the progression of NAFLD through a reduction in total liver fibrosis. Ongoing studies aim to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these different immune-metabolic responses.</description>

      <title>Feature based bipolar plate forming</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1757-899x/1307/1/012032</link>
      <description>D. Meelkop, Hans-Karl Janssen, C. Brecher, IOP conference series. Materials science and engineering. 1307(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399212068

                Abstract By the end of the 1990s, the global peak of energy supply from oil and gas deposits had already been reached. Since then, there has been a clear trend towards the development of new, more sustainable ways of supplying energy. To realize this reduction, a holistic and rapid restructuring of the energy supply towards CO2-free and renewable energy production, storage and processing across all areas of life is necessary. The development and implementation of a functioning hydrogen economy can be crucial with respect to the goal of climate neutrality. The scale-up and commercialization of technologies for the cost-effective production and use of hydrogen carry significant importance. Accordingly, innovative production technologies and process chains must be developed to be able to manufacture fuel cells reliably in high volumes and at optimized costs. In this context, BPPs in the PEM-FC are responsible for about 80 % of the total weight, just over 50 % of the system volume, and up to 40 % of the total cost. Current research approaches in the field of BPP forming focus mainly on the optimization of a pre-selected production technology. Thereby, the possibility of combining different forming technologies to represent a holistic process chain is mostly disregarded. This research gap is to be closed by the developments within the scope of this work. The bipolar plate is not to be regarded as a coherent component, but as a composition of different geometric features.</description>

                Semiconductor photoelectrochemistry (SPEC) is a sub-discipline of physical electrochemistry that deals with the basics of semiconductors and their application for effective harnessing of light and generating electron/hole pairs (reducing/oxidizing agents) inside a photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell/reactor to perform desired redox processes. These semiconductor-based electrochemical systems have found widespread applications, among which we can highlight semiconductor-assisted water photosplitting to produce hydrogen fuel and oxygen gas. This process can also be conducted in the presence of atmospheric molecules such as N2 or CO2, with the aim of their fixation, reduction (hydrogenation), and production of H-based fuels and strategic chemicals like ammonia, methanol, and oxygenates. Beyond technological importance in producing green fuels and photosynthesis of valuable materials, SPEC has found emerging applications in environmental remediation, including degradation of pollutants such as organic dyes/antibiotics/pesticides, organosulfurs, SOx, and H2S hazmat. Herein, we fundamentally address the matter of SPEC and explain how redox processes can occur in a PEC system without consuming electricity. This book chapter covers the application of semiconductors in both powdery and thin-film forms. It also describes how a semiconductor photoelectrode (SPE) can be utilized in a single- or two-electrode setup, and its activity can be easily altered by applying faradaic or electrostatic biases.</description>

                Using glass powder for partially replacing of fine aggregate in concrete helps to reduce the demand for natural resources like sand, promote recycling of glass waste and enhance the overall strength and durability of concrete, it can also improve the thermal and sound insulation properties of concrete. Zeolite is a naturally occurring mineral that can enhance the properties of concrete, and increase its strength and durability. It can also help with reducing the carbon footprint of concrete production. By partially replacing cement with zeolite, we can reduce the amount of cement needed, which in turn reduces the carbon emissions associated with cement production. Zeolite is a type of porous mineral that has unique properties, making it a potential substitute for cement in concrete production. When zeolite is used as supplementary cementitious material, it improves strength and durability of the concrete while reducing its environmental impact. This property helps to improve the workability of the mix and enhance the hydration process of cement. Additionally, zeolite can contribute to the formation of additional cementitious materials, which can further enhance the durability and strength of the concrete. By partially replacing cement with zeolite, we can reduce the overall amount of cement used in concrete production. Manufacturing of cement is a main source of co2 emissions, this reduction can help to mitigate the environmental impact of concrete manufacturing.</description>

      <title>The Electric Vehicle Market in Brazil: A Systematic Literature Review of Factors Influencing Purchase Decisions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/su16114594</link>
      <description>Marceli Adriane Schvartz, Amanda Lange Salvia, Luciana Brandli, Walter Leal Filho, Lucas Veiga &#195;&#129;vila, Sustainability. 16(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399176718

                Technological advancement has propelled global economic growth, but it has also led to high rates of pollution emissions, underscoring the urgency of environmental issues. The transportation sector, particularly the rise in individual vehicle ownership, significantly contributes to atmospheric pollution. In this context, Brazil faces growing challenges, largely due to the high number of individual motor vehicles. Transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs) is seen as a sustainable alternative to reduce emissions of polluting gases. However, it is important to consider that EVs may indirectly generate pollution due to energy production in thermal power plants. Nevertheless, EVs are often sought by countries to reduce dependence on imported fuels and to mitigate urban pollution. This study aims to understand the factors influencing the purchase decision of EVs in Brazil through a systematic literature review and validation by specialists using the fuzzy Delphi method. The results indicate 37 variables, grouped into five main blocks: psychological factors, performance factors, environmental factors, barriers, and prospects for the automotive sector. The validation of these variables by specialists provides a solid foundation for the next stage of the research, which involves administering the questionnaire to the general community. Considering these results will lead to strategies aimed at promoting EV adoption, in line with global sustainability challenges and the reduction in CO2 emissions.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the Impact of Driver Behavior on the Carbon Footprint in Morocco's Transportation Sector</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2024.05.060</link>

                With population growth, industrial expansion, and increased energy demand intensifying pollution, Morocco is suffering from a shortage of fossil fuels, urgently calling for climate intervention to stimulate the imperative reduction of its carbon footprint. Indeed, the country has realized that it is time to monitor its environmental indicators such as energy consumption, accounting, and carbon footprint to comply with global efforts to reduce carbon footprint and aim for energy efficiency while preserving and optimizing its energy resources. Much attention has been focused on the transportation sector, the second-largest global polluter, which will be the subject of our analysis. Our case study will focus on the evaluation of three vehicles to examine the influence of driver behavior on energy consumption and carbon footprint. Data collection was carried out using UPLOGISTIX, a solution developed by our hosting entity, which aims to present calculations of environmental measures to display the results and ultimately provide recommendations for reducing its carbon footprint. An approach has been proposed to achieve the set objectives. The results of our analysis highlight the existence of a significant relationship between behavioral barriers and energy consumption. Indeed, the behavior of a reckless driver, characterized by abrupt braking, rapid accelerations, and other factors, leads to an actual energy consumption that exceeds recommended standards. This excessive consumption results in a considerable production of CO2 emissions.</description>

                Attempts to create a novel Mg&#8208;Be bond by reaction of [(DIPePBDI*)MgNa]2 with Be[N(SiMe3)2]2 failed; DIPePBDI* = HC[(tBu)C=N(DIPeP)]2, DIPeP = 2,6&#8208;Et2C&#8208;phenyl. Even at elevated temperatures, no conversion was observed. This is likely caused by strong steric shielding of the Be center. A similar reaction with the more open Cp*BeCl gave in quantitative yield (DIPePBDI)MgBeCp* (1). The crystal structure shows a Mg&#8208;Be bond of 2.469(4) &#197;. Homolytic cleavage of the Mg&#8208;Be bond requires &#916;H = 69.6 kcal mol&#713;1 (cf. CpBe&#8208;BeCp 69.0 kcal mol&#713;1 and (DIPPBDI)Mg&#8208;Mg(DIPPBDI) 55.8 kcal mol&#713;1). Natural&#8208;Population&#8208;Analysis (NPA) shows fragment charges: (DIPePBDI*)Mg +0.27 / BeCp* &#8208;0.27. The very low NPA charge on Be (+0.62) compared to Mg (+1.21) and the strongly upfield 9Be NMR signal at &#8208;23.7 ppm are in line with considerable electron density on Be and the formal oxidation state assignment of MgII&#8208;Be0. Despite this Mg&#948;+&#8208;Be&#948;&#713; polarity, 1 is extremely thermally stable and unreactive towards H2, CO, N2, cyclohexene and carbodiimide. It reacted with benzophenone, azobenzene, phenyl acetylene, CO2 and CS2. Reaction with 1&#8208;adamantyl azide led to reductive coupling and formation of an N6&#8208;chain. The azide reagent also inserted in the Cp*&#8208;Be bond. The inertness of 1 is likely due to bulky ligands protecting the Mg&#8208;Be unit.</description>

                Electrolyte decomposition significantly impacts the long-term stability of Li-ion batteries, generating liquid and gaseous byproducts. This study focuses on formaldehyde formation, a critical byproduct from CO2 reduction in Ni-rich Li-ion batteries. Through experimental and computational analyses, formaldehyde emerges from carbonate-based electrolyte decomposition. Examining overcharge, over-discharge, and fast charging conditions, formaldehyde concentration sharply increases under overcharge, indicating severe electrolyte breakdown, while over-discharge shows a gradual rise. Fast charging similarly elevates formaldehyde levels, underscoring the link between electrolyte decomposition and abusive conditions. Importantly, this research proposes utilizing formaldehyde concentration from the initial cycle as a predictive marker for assessing long-term Ni-rich Li-ion battery stability trends. Elevated initial formaldehyde indicates potential capacity fade and accelerated degradation, enabling proactive mitigation strategies. The study elucidates mechanisms governing formaldehyde formation, providing a foundation for developing electrolyte formulations and electrode materials with enhanced decomposition resistance and improved stability. This investigation contributes to the fundamental understanding of electrolyte decomposition in Ni-rich Li-ion batteries and presents a novel approach to predicting long-term performance based on initial formaldehyde measurements, advancing high-performance and reliable energy storage solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantification and mitigation of bottom-trawling impacts on sedimentary organic carbon stocks in the North Sea</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-2547-2024</link>
      <description>Lucas Porz, Wenyan Zhang, Nils Christiansen, Jan Kossack, Ute Daewel, Corinna Schrum, Biogeosciences. 21(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399089377

                Abstract. The depletion of sedimentary organic carbon stocks by the use of bottom-contacting fishing gear and the potential climate impacts resulting from remineralization of the organic carbon to CO2 have recently been heavily debated. An issue that has remained unaddressed thus far regards the fate of organic carbon resuspended into the water column following disturbance by fishing gear. To resolve this, a 3D-coupled numerical ocean sediment macrobenthos model is used in this study to quantify the impacts of bottom trawling on organic carbon and macrobenthos stocks in North Sea sediments. Using available information on vessel activity, gear components, and sediment type, we generate daily time series of trawling impacts and simulate 6 years of trawling activity in the model, as well as four management scenarios in which trawling effort is redistributed from areas inside to areas outside of trawling closure zones. North Sea sediments contained 552.2&#177;192.4 kt less organic carbon and 13.6&#177;2.6 % less macrobenthos biomass in the trawled simulations than in the untrawled simulations by the end of each year. The organic carbon loss is equivalent to aqueous emissions of 2.0&#177;0.7 Mt CO2 each year, roughly half of which is likely to accumulate in the atmosphere on multi-decadal timescales. The impacts were elevated in years with higher levels of trawling pressure and vice versa. Results showed high spatial variability, with a high loss of organic carbon due to trawling in some areas, while organic carbon content increased in nearby untrawled areas following transport and redeposition. The area most strongly impacted was the heavily trawled and carbon-rich Skagerrak. Simulated trawling closures in planned offshore wind farms (OWFs) and outside of core fishing grounds (CFGs) had negligible effects on net sedimentary organic carbon, while closures in marine protected areas (MPAs) had a moderately positive impact. The largest positive impact arose for trawling closures in carbon protection zones (CPZs), which were defined as areas where organic carbon is both plentiful and labile and thereby most vulnerable to disturbance. In that scenario, the net impacts of trawling on organic carbon and macrobenthos biomass were reduced by 29 % and 54 %, respectively. These results demonstrate that carbon protection and habitat protection can be combined without requiring a reduction in net fishing effort.</description>

      <title>Nonthermal plasma removal of CH4-NOx under LNG engine exhaust environment: Experiment, mechanism and kinetic analysis</title>

                Abstract To explore the mechanism underlying the removal of CH4 and NOx, which are typical emissions from LNG engines, through the nonthermal plasma method, aplasma chemistry model of CH4-NOx under the LNG engine exhaust environment&amp;#xD;was established in this study. Sixty key reactions affecting the conversion of CH4, CO, and NOx were determined through sensitivity analysis, and their pre-exponential factors were optimized using a genetic algorithm. The proposed model shows good performance in predicting the concentrations of CH4, CO, and NOx under the exhaust conditions of LNG engine. Then, reaction path analyses for evolution of CH4, CO, NO, and NO2 were performed under specific conditions.&amp;#xD;The results showed that CH4 mainly decomposed into CH2 that is subsequently converted into CO and CO2. CH2 is the main source for CO production. The concentration of NOx is determined by the oxidation reactions of N with O2, OH, and HO2. The specific concentration distributions of NO and NO2 were influenced by the oxidation-reduction reactions between them. Analyses of the time scales for the conversion processes of CH4, CO, and NOx were also conducted, and it was found that the reaction time scales of CH4 and CO were approximately 1&#215;10 -10 -1&#215;10 -5 s, and that was approximately 1&#215;10 -9 -1&#215;10 -4 s for NOx. Furthermore, during the overlapping period for the conversion of CH4, CO, and NOx, the NOx was dominant in the competition for O. This study provides a basis for the construction of a plasma catalytic chemistry model of CH4-NOx under LNG engine exhaust conditions.&amp;#xD;</description>

                Switzerland, a wealthy country, has a cutting-edge healthcare system, yet per capita, it emits over one ton of CO2, ranking among the world&#8217;s most polluting healthcare systems. To estimate the carbon footprint of the healthcare system of Geneva&#8217;s canton, we collected raw data on the activities of its stakeholders. Our analysis shows that when excluding medicines and medical devices, hospitals are the main greenhouse gas emitter by far, accounting for 48% of the healthcare system&#8217;s emission, followed by nursing homes (20%), private practice (18%), medical analysis laboratories (7%), dispensing pharmacies (4%), the homecare institution (3%), and the ambulance services (&lt;1%). The most prominent emission items globally are medicines and medical devices by far, accounting for 59%, followed by building operation (19%), transport (11%), and catering (4%), among others. To actively reduce Geneva&#8217;s healthcare carbon emissions, we propose direct and indirect measures, either with an immediate impact or implementing systemic changes concerning medicine prescription, building heating and cooling, low-carbon means of transport, less meaty diets, and health prevention. This study, the first of its kind in Switzerland, deciphers where most of the greenhouse gas emissions arise and proposes action levers to pave the way for ambitious emission reduction policies. We also invite health authorities to engage pharmaceutical and medical suppliers in addressing their own responsibilities, notably through the adaptation of procurement processes and requirements.</description>

      <title>Insights into the spatiotemporal heterogeneity, sectoral contributions and drivers of provincial CO2 emissions in China from 2019 to 2022</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2024.05.041</link>
      <description>Hanyu Zhang, Weidong Guo, Siwen Wang, Zhiliang Yao, Ling Lv, Yan Teng, Xin Li, Xianbao Shen, Journal of Environmental Sciences/Journal of environmental sciences. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399208776

                CO2 emissions (CEs) pose a growing threat to environmental changes and global warming, attracting extensive attention. Here, we leveraged near-real-time monitoring data spanning 2019 to 2022 to investigate spatiotemporal heterogeneity, sectoral contributions, provincial spatial correlation, and driving factors influencing CEs at the provincial level in China. Our analysis, integrating Moran's Index analysis, Spearman correlation analysis, and the Geographically Weighted Regression model, unveiled China's consistent world-leading CEs, surpassing 10,000 Mt over the study period. Spatially, CEs exhibited a heterogeneous distribution, with markedly higher emissions in eastern and northern regions compared to western and southern areas. Temporally, CEs displayed significant fluctuations, peaking in the fourth quarter before declining in subsequent quarters. Chinese New Year and COVID-19 had the biggest effects on CEs, with average daily reductions of -20.8 % and -18.9 %, respectively, compared to the four-year average and the same period in 2019. Sectoral analysis highlighted the power and industry sectors as primary contributors to CEs in China, jointly accounting for 37.9 %-40.2 % and 43.5 %-46.4 % of total CEs, respectively. Spatial clustering analysis identified a distinct High-High agglomeration region, predominantly encompassing provinces such as Inner Mongolia, Shandong and Jiangsu. Furthermore, total energy consumption and electricity consumption emerged as significant drivers of CEs, exhibiting correlation coefficients exceeding 0.9, followed by exhaust emissions, population size, and gross domestic product. Moreover, the influence of drivers on provincial CEs exhibited notable spatial heterogeneity, with regression coefficients displaying a decreasing gradient from north to south. These findings provide scientific and technological support to realize the provincial dual-carbon goals in China.</description>

      <title>Physically Structured Variational Inference for Bayesian Full Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.171691139.96106369/v1</link>
      <description>Xuebin Zhao, Andrew Curtis, Authorea (Authorea). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399075322

                Full waveform inversion (FWI) creates high resolution models of the Earth&#8217;s subsurface structures from seismic waveform data. Due to the non-linearity and non-uniqueness of FWI problems, finding globally best-fitting model solutions is not necessarily desirable since they fit noise as well as signal in the data. Bayesian FWI calculates a so-called posterior probability distribution function, which describes all possible model solutions and their uncertainties. In this paper, we solve Bayesian FWI using variational inference and propose a new methodology called physically structured variational inference, in which a physics-based structure is imposed on the variational distribution. In a simple example motivated by prior information from past FWI solutions, we include parameter correlations between pairs of spatial locations within a dominant wavelength of each other, and set other correlations to zero. This makes the method far more efficient in terms of both memory requirements and computation, at the cost of some loss of generality in the solution found. We demonstrate the proposed method with a 2D acoustic FWI scenario, and compare the results with those obtained using other methods. This verifies that the method can produce accurate statistical information about the posterior distribution with hugely improved efficiency (in our FWI example, 1 order of magnitude in computation). We further demonstrate that despite the possible reduction in generality of the solution, the posterior uncertainties can be used to solve post-inversion interrogation problems connected to estimating volumes of subsurface reservoirs and of stored CO2, with minimal bias, creating a highly efficient FWI-based decision-making workflow.</description>

                Travertine cutting generates rubble and waste powder, prompting the need for effective waste utilization. This study aims to develop travertine permeable concrete (TPC) using travertine aggregate and waste powder. An orthogonal test method assessed TPC variations in travertine powder replacement rates, aggregate grading, and void content for porosity, permeability, mechanical strength, and heavy metal adsorption ability. The void content greatly influences the amount of cementitious material and is crucial for TPC performance. To guarantee compliance with the engineering performance for fully pervious pavement, the recommended void content of TPC should not exceed 20% to have satisfactory compressive strength and permeability. Cement replacement with 5-10% travertine powder can satisfy engineering requirements, heavy metal adsorption, waste utilization, and CO2 emission reduction. TPC demonstrates much lower removal rates under the rapid method than the immersion method for Cd2+, Cu2+ and Pb2+, mainly due to the difference in contact time. After 25 cycles, the optimized TPC shows less mass and strength loss, demonstrating excellent freeze-thaw resistance. Furthermore, a novel lab-scale rainfall simulation system for travertine permeable concrete pavement (TPCP) was built to assess the water infiltration of TPCP. TPCP can effectively reduce runoff, reaching over 96% within one hour for various inflow intensities. After half an hour, the removal rates of Cd2+ and Cu2+ by TPCP were only 41.5 and 79.1%, respectively, but TPCP achieves exceptional Pb2+ adsorption with a removal rate of over 97% under the ternary competitive mechanism.</description>

                The built environment plays a significant role in material consumption and CO2 emissions, necessitating a proactive shift towards a circular economy (CE). Technical innovations (TIs) are recognized as one of the key drivers in advancing the circularity of the built environment. However, the comprehensive understanding of TIs' influence on the lifecycle and metabolism of construction materials is yet to be explored. Concrete, being a vital construction material, holds particular significance in assessing the effectiveness of CE strategies in the built environment. Hence, this study develops a continuous material flow analysis-based system dynamics model to analyze the impact of TIs in concrete components and construction processes on the CE, adopting a perspective that aligns with real-world logic, thereby reducing the complexity of the dMFA method. Our findings demonstrate that the adoption of different TIs can enhance circularity and resource efficiency within the system by influencing the four circular flows (4Rs). Under stable stock conditions, the combined application of these TIs can yield a maximum reduction of 71% in inflows and prevent 65% of natural stock resource losses attributable to their influences on circular flows, as compared to the reference scenario devoid of TIs. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the scenario contributing the highest circular flows does not necessarily optimize resource savings. Therefore, when devising CE strategies, careful consideration should be given to the underlying impacts of circular flows rather than solely focusing on maximizing the flows themselves. These results, in conjunction with geographical spatial features, can guide the design of appropriate technological interventions tailored to the local built environment, thereby enhancing the efficiency of CE strategies. However, as the data utilized in this paper are derived from literature, we believe that further case studies are warranted to refine these general findings and mitigate the limitations in both quantity and quality of data, thereby enhancing their contextual relevance.</description>

                Two thermophilic spore-forming sulfate-reducing strains, 435T and 781, were isolated from oil and gas reservoirs in Western Siberia (Russia) about 50 years ago. Both strains were found to be neutrophilic, chemoorganotrophic, anaerobic bacteria, growing at 45&#8211;70 &#176;C (optimum, 55&#8211;60 &#176;C) and with 0&#8211;4.5% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 0.5&#8211;1% NaCl). The major fatty acids were iso-C15:0, iso-C17:0, C16:0, and C18:0. In sulfate-reducing conditions, the strains utilized H2/CO2, formate, lactate, pyruvate, malate, fumarate, succinate, methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, butyrate, valerate, and palmitate. In 2005, based on phenotypic characteristics and a 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the strains were described as &#8216;Desulfotomaculum salinum&#8217; sp. nov. However, this species was not validly published because the type strain was not deposited in two culture collections. In this study, a genomic analysis of strain 435T was carried out to determine its taxonomic affiliation. The genome size of strain 435T was 2.886 Mb with a 55.1% genomic G + C content. The average nucleotide identity and digital DNA&#8211;DNA hybridization values were highest between strain 435T and members of the genus Desulfofundulus, 78.7&#8211;93.3% and 25.0&#8211;52.2%, respectively; these values were below the species delineation cut-offs (&lt;95&#8211;96% and &lt;70%). The cumulative phenotypic and phylogenetic data indicate that two strains represent a novel species within the genus Desulfofundulus, for which the name Desulfofundulus salinus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 435T (=VKM B-1492T = DSM 23196T). A genome analysis of strain 435T revealed the genes for dissimilatory sulfate reduction, autotrophic carbon fixation via the Wood&#8211;Ljungdahl pathway, hydrogen utilization, methanol and organic acids metabolism, and sporulation, which were confirmed by cultivation studies.</description>

                Abstract. Understanding global forest carbon stocks is necessary to assess the world&#8217;s global carbon budget, with land cover change being estimated to contribute roughly 20 % of the emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. In the last decade or so, remote sensing has contributed estimates of above ground stocks of biomass &#8211; a key part of forest carbon stocks &#8211; with over twenty biomass maps available at pan-tropical and global scales. To further the understanding of forest carbon stocks, this research seeks to synthesize the findings of disparate data sources on: (i) forest cover, (ii) forest cover change, (iii) above ground biomass (AGB) / above ground carbon (AGC) stocks in forests. Satellite-derived forest cover and AGB estimates have substantial variability. In 2020, forests were estimated to cover between 22.6 million and 49.7 million km2 of the Earth&#8217;s land surface, thus ranging from 17.1 % to 37.6 % of total land cover. Likewise, examining forest cover change from available datasets, the estimated change in global forest cover between 2000 and 2020 was loss of approximately 88,734 to 124,184 km2 per year, combined with regrowth of forest cover of approximately 58,628 to 169,912 km2 per year. Combining that forest cover data with remotely sensed AGB estimates, total stocks of AGB for the year 2000 were estimated to be 325&#8211;697 Gt, while for the year 2020, the range was 401&#8211;580 Gt. The equivalent quantity of CO2 (i.e., CO2e) of that stock of forest biomass was therefore estimated to be 560 to 1,200 Gt for the year 2000, and 692&#8211;999 Gt for the year 2020. Our analysis found that the forest cover loss in tropics was the largest, at the rate of 1.4 % to 3.5 % net reduction between 2000 and 2020, whereas for the same time period, the temperate and boreal zones showed substantially lower forest cover loss (-2.5 % to 0.5 % and 1 % to 5.3 % respectively). This synthesis paper demonstrates that there is a fairly wide range of variability in estimates related to forest cover, forest cover change, and above ground biomass stocks, which are the main inputs for estimating forest carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions from land cover change.</description>
