                This dataset is associated to "A localization transition underlies the mode-coupling crossover of glasses" by D. Coslovich, A. Ninarello and L. Berthier [https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03171]. It includes post-processed data and workflow to reproduce the analysis and the figures of the article and of the supplemental information. The easiest way to reproduce the analysis and figures, and then check the results, is to use the make script: ./make all Alternatively, the analysis and figures can be reproduced in any of the following ways following the workflow described in the org-mode project file project.org using the individual bash and gnuplot scripts in src/ and plots/ Folders and files description: analysis/: post-processed data src/: bash, python and gnuplot scripts needed to reproduce the analysis plots/: eps figures that appear in the paper and supplemental information and associated gnuplot scripts make: convenience script to setup the python environment, analyze the data and reproduce the figures project.org: org-mode project file with workflow and supplemental information project.pdf: pdf version of the org-mode project file project.bib: bibtex bibliography associated to the project Dependencies: numpy (1.16.3) argh (0.26.2) atooms (1.9.1) gnuplot (5.0.0) The analysis scripts have been tested with python versions 2.7 and 3.5. The org-mode project file has been tested with org version 9.1.13. Note: this dataset does not contain (at least yet) the particle configurations associated to saddle points, only the post-processed files containing selected properties of their normal modes.

      <title>Traces Used For Calibration Of Npb Lu With Smpi / Simgrid</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.273276</link>
      <description>Franz Heinrich, Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research). None(None)] 2017. https://openalex.org/W4393509043

                These traces were used to calibrate the NAS NPB Benchmark LU with SMPI. The archives contain the traces for 12 cores, all run on 1 single node (that contained 12 cores). The extracted size should be around 7 GB for the MPI one and 600 MB for SMPI. The .org-file contains the analysis used to obtain the required input files for SimGrid. You can load them in org-mode and then execute via "C-c C-v b" the whole buffer. Make sure to extract the archives in /tmp/ or change the paths accordingly.</description>
