                Suplementary information. Contains the org-mode computational notebook with all the input data (geometries, basis sets, pseudo-potentials) and output data (computed energies, densities, number of determinants) related to the article. A csv file is created by the notebook and an HTML export of the notebook is also provided.</description>

      <title>A localization transition underlies the mode-coupling crossover of glasses</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1478600</link>
      <description>Daniele Coslovich, Andrea Ninarello, Ludovic Berthier, Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research). None(None)] 2022. https://openalex.org/W4393556008

                This dataset is associated to "A localization transition underlies the mode-coupling crossover of glasses" by D. Coslovich, A. Ninarello and L. Berthier [https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03171]. It includes post-processed data and workflow to reproduce the analysis and the figures of the article and of the supplemental information. Supplementary information is available in the Supplement section of the project document (project.pdf). The easiest way to reproduce the analysis and figures, and then check the results, is to use the make script: ./make all Alternatively, the analysis and figures can be reproduced in any of the following ways following the workflow described in the org-mode project file project.org using the individual bash and gnuplot scripts in src/ and plots/ Folders and files description: analysis/: post-processed data src/: bash, python and gnuplot scripts needed to reproduce the analysis plots/: eps figures that appear in the paper and supplemental information and associated gnuplot scripts make: convenience script to setup the python environment, analyze the data and reproduce the figures project.org: org-mode project file with workflow and supplemental information project.pdf: pdf project file with workflow and supplemental information project.bib: bibtex bibliography associated to the project project.setup: org-mode export configuration Dependencies: numpy (1.21.6) scipy (1.11.1) argh (0.26.2) atooms (1.9.1) gnuplot (5.0.0) The analysis scripts have been tested with python 3.8. The org-mode project file has been tested with org version 9.1.13. Note: this dataset does not contain (at least yet) the particle configurations associated to saddle points, only the post-processed files containing selected properties of their normal modes. Changelog: 1.2.2 fix requirements 1.2.1 fix ./src/adiff.py fix final check of ./make all improve pdf layout improve handling of org properties 1.2.0 add analysis of eigenvector-following optimizations small changes and fixes to analysis scripts 1.1.0 add "all" target to ./make fix ./make check improve setup description 1.0.0 initial submission</description>

      <title>Traces Used For Calibration Of Npb Lu With Smpi / Simgrid</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.273276</link>
      <description>Franz Heinrich, Zenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research). None(None)] 2017. https://openalex.org/W4393509043

                These traces were used to calibrate the NAS NPB Benchmark LU with SMPI. The archives contain the traces for 12 cores, all run on 1 single node (that contained 12 cores). The extracted size should be around 7 GB for the MPI one and 600 MB for SMPI. The .org-file contains the analysis used to obtain the required input files for SimGrid. You can load them in org-mode and then execute via "C-c C-v b" the whole buffer. Make sure to extract the archives in /tmp/ or change the paths accordingly.</description>
