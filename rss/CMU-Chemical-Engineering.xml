      <title>Optimal retrofitting of conventional oil refinery into sustainable bio&#8208;refinery under uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aic.18371</link>
      <description>L. Zhang, Ana I. Torres, Bingzhen Chen, Zhihong Yuan, Ignacio E. Grossmann, AIChE Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391308369

                Abstract This article focuses on a novel optimization problem to retrofit a conventional fossil&#8208;based refinery into a hybrid biomass&#8208;based refinery. A mixed&#8208;integer linear programming model, which considers a 10&#8208;year&#8208;long retrofit planning along with operational constraints in each year, is formulated. The problem is extended to a multistage stochastic programming model to handle both endogenous and exogenous uncertainties, and solved through a series of two&#8208;stage stochastic programming subproblems. Furthermore, a Lagrangean decomposition algorithm is implemented to solve such a problem. By determining whether to add new units or retrofit existing units to the selected biomass&#8208;based technologies, the results provide flexible design alternatives with consideration of operational constraints for each year. The results show the advantages of the selected biomass&#8208;based technologies and enhance the performance of the final solution under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Circumventing Data Imbalance in Magnetic Ground State Data for Magnetic Moment Predictions</title>

                Abstract Magnetic materials play a crucial role in the transition to more sustainable forms of energy and electric vehicles. There is an anticipated shortage in magnetic materials in the future, and as a result there is an urgent need to discover and design new magnetic materials. Computational magnetic material design using density functional theory is daunting because of the challenge in identifying magnetic ground states from a combinatorially large set of possibilities. Machine learning offers a path forward by enabling efficient surrogate models that can more readily enumerate these states, but there is a dearth of training data available, and what is available tends to be imbalanced with too much non-magnetic data. In this work we show that the discrete and previously tackled data imbalance that exists at the level of the magnetic ordering leads to an imbalanced continuous distribution with many zeros when the data is unraveled at the atomic magnetic moment level, which subsequently leads to models with low accuracy for magnetic properties. We mitigate this by using a two-part model framework. Our scheme is able to classify atoms into magnetic and non-magnetic with an F1 score and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of $\sim$ 91 \% and then to provide an implicit embedding representation that maps directly onto the magnitude of the magnetic moment with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.1 $\mu_{\text{B}}$. Beyond screening for new magnetic materials, we demonstrate an additional practical use case of our scheme: the provision of good initial guesses for magnetic moments in first-principles electronic relaxations. Such initialization is shown to lead to faster convergence to configurations that lie closer to the ground state.</description>

      <title>Controlling Bond Scission Pathways of Isopropanol on Fe- and Pt-Modified Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N Model Surfaces and Powder Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c04700</link>

                Biomass valorization can be used to produce value-added chemicals and fuels from renewable biomass resources by upgrading them via selective bond scission while retaining certain functional groups. Specifically, upgrading biomass through the dehydrogenation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds has gained interest as a method of utilizing biomass-derived alcohols while additionally producing H2. In this work, isopropanol was used as a probe molecule to control bond scission selectivity over Fe- and Pt-modified molybdenum nitride (Mo2N) model surfaces and powder catalysts. Trends in the selectivity toward dehydration and dehydrogenation were dependent on both the type and coverage of the metal overlayer on model surfaces. These results were then extended to the corresponding powder catalysts to demonstrate how model surface studies can inform the design of supported catalysts. Density functional theory calculations provided insights into controlling the dehydration and dehydrogenation pathways. This work shows that a fundamental understanding of the reactivity and intermediates on Mo2N-based model surfaces can be applied to understand the catalytic performance of metal-modified Mo2N powder catalysts, and also demonstrates that Mo2N-based catalysts are potentially promising materials for upgrading biomass-derived oxygenates.</description>

      <title>Routing and scheduling of platform supply vessels in offshore oil and gas logistics</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2024.106556</link>
      <description>Victor A. Silva, Akang Wang, Virg&#237;lio Jos&#233; Martins Ferreira Filho, Chrysanthos E. Gounaris, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391147858

                In this work, we focus on an operational logistics problem that arises in the offshore oil and gas exploration and production industry. In particular, we aim to design cost-effective routes and schedules for platform supply vessels, which are routinely employed to deliver necessary supplies to the platforms as well as to collect from those platforms used materials that need to be transported back to the onshore base for maintenance, reuse, or discarding. To address the rich-featured routing problem that arises in this offshore logistics application, we introduce a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation and propose a specialized branch-and-cut algorithm to solve such a model. Furthermore, in order to evaluate our proposed algorithm&#8217;s performance, we conduct an extensive computational study using representative benchmark instances inspired by real operational data. The computational results show that our algorithm solved the majority of those instances to optimality, demonstrating its potential for practical use in offshore oil and gas logistics operations.</description>
