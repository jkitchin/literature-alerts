                Introduction Chronic lung infection due to bacterial biofilms is one of the leading causes of mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Among many species colonizing the lung airways, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are two virulent pathogens involved in mechanically robust biofilms that are difficult to eradicate using airway clearance techniques like lung lavage. To remove such biological materials, glycoside hydrolase-based compounds are commonly employed for targeting and breaking down the biofilm matrix, and subsequently increasing cell susceptibility to antibiotics. Materials and methods In this study, we evaluate the effects of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and Cysteamine (CYST) in disrupting interfacial bacterial films, targeting different components of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). We characterize the mechanics and structural integrity of the interfacial bacterial films using pendant drop elastometry and scanning electron microscopy. Results and discussion Our results show that the film architectures are compromised by treatment with disrupting agents for 6 h, which reduces film elasticity significantly. These effects are profound in the wild type and mucoid P. aeruginosa , compared to S. aureus . We further assess the effects of competition and cooperation between S. aureus and P. aeruginosa on the mechanics of composite interfacial films. Films of S. aureus and wild-type P. aeruginosa cocultures lose mechanical strength while those of S. aureus and mucoid P. aeruginosa exhibit improved storage modulus. Treatment with NAC and CYST reduces the elastic property of both composite films, owing to the drugs&#8217; ability to disintegrate their EPS matrix. Overall, our results provide new insights into methods for assessing the efficacy of mucolytic agents against interfacial biofilms relevant to cystic fibrosis infection.</description>

      <title>Controlling Bond Scission Pathways of Isopropanol on Fe- and Pt-Modified Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;N Model Surfaces and Powder Catalysts</title>

                Biomass valorization can be used to produce value-added chemicals and fuels from renewable biomass resources by upgrading them via selective bond scission while retaining certain functional groups. Specifically, upgrading biomass through the dehydrogenation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds has gained interest as a method of utilizing biomass-derived alcohols while additionally producing H2. In this work, isopropanol was used as a probe molecule to control bond scission selectivity over Fe- and Pt-modified molybdenum nitride (Mo2N) model surfaces and powder catalysts. Trends in the selectivity toward dehydration and dehydrogenation were dependent on both the type and coverage of the metal overlayer on model surfaces. These results were then extended to the corresponding powder catalysts to demonstrate how model surface studies can inform the design of supported catalysts. Density functional theory calculations provided insights into controlling the dehydration and dehydrogenation pathways. This work shows that a fundamental understanding of the reactivity and intermediates on Mo2N-based model surfaces can be applied to understand the catalytic performance of metal-modified Mo2N powder catalysts, and also demonstrates that Mo2N-based catalysts are potentially promising materials for upgrading biomass-derived oxygenates.</description>

      <title>Routing and scheduling of platform supply vessels in offshore oil and gas logistics</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2024.106556</link>
      <description>Victor A. Silva, Akang Wang, Virg&#237;lio Jos&#233; Martins Ferreira Filho, Chrysanthos E. Gounaris, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391147858

                In this work, we focus on an operational logistics problem that arises in the offshore oil and gas exploration and production industry. In particular, we aim to design cost-effective routes and schedules for platform supply vessels, which are routinely employed to deliver necessary supplies to the platforms as well as to collect from those platforms used materials that need to be transported back to the onshore base for maintenance, reuse, or discarding. To address the rich-featured routing problem that arises in this offshore logistics application, we introduce a novel mixed-integer linear programming formulation and propose a specialized branch-and-cut algorithm to solve such a model. Furthermore, in order to evaluate our proposed algorithm&#8217;s performance, we conduct an extensive computational study using representative benchmark instances inspired by real operational data. The computational results show that our algorithm solved the majority of those instances to optimality, demonstrating its potential for practical use in offshore oil and gas logistics operations.</description>
