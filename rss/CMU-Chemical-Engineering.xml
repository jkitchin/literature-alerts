      <title>Beyond Force Metrics: Pre-Training MLFFs for Stable MD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2506.14850</link>
      <description>Shriram Maheshwari, Janghoon Ock, Adeesh Kolluru, Amir Barati Farimani, John R. Kitchin, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4415332979

                Machine-learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a promising solution for speeding up ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, where accurate force predictions are critical but often computationally expensive. In this work, we employ GemNet-T, a graph neural network model, as an MLFF and investigate two training strategies: (1) direct training on MD17 (10K samples) without pre-training, and (2) pre-training on the large-scale OC20 dataset followed by fine-tuning on MD17 (10K). While both approaches achieve low force mean absolute errors (MAEs), reaching 5 meV/A per atom, we find that lower force errors do not necessarily guarantee stable MD simulations. Notably, the pre-trained GemNet-T model yields significantly improved simulation stability, sustaining trajectories up to three times longer than the model trained from scratch. These findings underscore the value of pre-training on large, diverse datasets to capture complex molecular interactions and highlight that force MAE alone is not always a sufficient metric of MD simulation stability.</description>

      <title>Long&#8208;Read, High&#8208;Resolution Sanger Sequencing by Micelle&#8208;Tagging Electrophoresis</title>

                ABSTRACT We demonstrate a gel&#8208;free electrophoretic separation of Sanger sequencing fragments up to 782 bases in length using nonionic wormlike micelles as drag&#8208;tags in micelle&#8208;tagging electrophoresis (MTE). This is an increase of 280 bases over previous MTE methods and a nearly three&#8208;fold improvement over end&#8208;labeled free&#8208;solution electrophoresis (ELFSE) methods that use covalently attached drag&#8208;tags. For MTE, C18 alkane groups are attached to primers prior to their enzymatic extension. This alkane group provides a binding site for wormlike micelles composed of CiEj&#8208;type nonionic surfactants in the running buffer. Transient attachment of micelles to the C18 alkane group provides a highly uniform drag, equal to that of an ssDNA fragment 309 bases long. To account for slight mobility differences among the BigDye chain terminators, we developed a two&#8208;parameter time&#8208;shifting procedure to align the electropherograms for each termination chemistry. The increase in read length for this low&#8208;viscosity buffer (2.1 cP) is attributed to the alignment procedure, the large yet uniform drag, and the small degree of adsorption&#8208;based band broadening.</description>
