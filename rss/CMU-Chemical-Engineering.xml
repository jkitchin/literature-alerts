                Babesiosis &#8212; a globally emerging tick-borne infectious disease primarily caused by the intraerythrocytic piroplasm parasite, Babesia microti &#8212; has traditionally been studied using animal models such as mice. Compared to animal models, microfluidic-based models offer advantages, including direct analysis of human samples (such as patient blood), enhanced assay capacity (including physical/optical access, consistency, and throughput), low costs, and easy adoption. Here, we report an open microfluidic platform named &#956;&#8211;Blood for monitoring B. microti infection dynamics in vitro. Compared to other microfluidic-based models, &#956;&#8211;Blood allows direct examination of infected and uninfected whole blood without preprocessing steps like blood dilution or cell isolation, minimizing observer artifacts and preserving the natural whole blood microenvironment. The system enables extended (days-long) monitoring of infection dynamics, including parasite identification, parasitemia measurement, and parasite-host cell interactions, using label-free phase contrast and fluorescence confocal microscopy. With its open microfluidic configuration, &#956;-Blood provides an in vitro model for studying blood-borne infections while maintaining integrity of the whole blood microenvironment.</description>

      <title>Photocatalytic effect of gold-zinc oxide composite nanostructures for the selective and controlled killing of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the removal of resistant bacterial biofilms from the body</title>

                Abstract Infections involving antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become a major problem. Pathogenic bacteria use mechanisms such as drug target bypass, target modification, and biofilm formation to evade treatment. To respond to these problems, antibacterial research using metal and metal oxide nanoparticles is currently active. Nanoparticles treat bacterial infections through reactive oxygen species generation or antibacterial ion release. However, their application has faced problems related to human compatibility, as they react non-specifically, targeting both mammalian and bacterial cells. In addition, ZnO nanoparticles show low antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, the demand for antibacterial substances with enhanced specificity and improved efficacy is increasing. We bound gold to the surface of ZnO nanoparticles, enabling photocatalytic and photothermal actions through visible light irradiation. To improve bacterial specificity, Concanavalin A (Con A), a lectin that can specifically target bacterial membrane lipopolysaccharides, was conjugated with the nanoparticles. We showed that Con A-conjugated Au/ZnO nanoparticles (Au/ZnO-Con A) exhibit photocatalytic and photothermal effects under white light, enhancing their antibacterial ability, and through enhanced specificity, increased antibacterial and anti-biofilm abilities were confirmed. The developed particles showed the potential to alleviate antibiotic resistance in a bacterial skin infection model, presenting a new platform for treating bacterial infections.

      <title>Magnetically Responsive Nanocultures for Direct Microbial Assessment in Soil Environments</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.17.654660</link>
      <description>Huda Usman, Mehdi Molaei, Stephen D. House, Martin F. Haase, Cindi L. Dennis, Tagbo H. R. Niepa, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4410477537

                Cultivating microorganisms in native-like conditions is vital for bioprospecting and accessing currently unculturable species. However, there remains a gap in scalable tools that can both mimic native microenvironments and enable targeted recovery of microbes from complex settings. Such approaches are essential to advance our understanding of microbial ecology, predict community functions, and discover novel biotherapeutics. We present magnetic nanocultures, a high-throughput microsystem for isolating and growing environmental microbes under near-native conditions. These nanoliter-scale bioreactors are encapsulated in semi-permeable membranes that form magnetic polymeric microcapsules using iron oxide nanoparticles within polydimethylsiloxane-based shells. This design offers mechanical stability and magnetic actuation, enabling efficient retrieval from soil-like environments. The nanocultures are optimized for optical and biological properties to support microbial encapsulation, growth, and sorting. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using magnetically responsive microenvironments to cultivate elusive microbes, offering a promising platform for discovering previously uncultured or unknown microbial species.</description>
