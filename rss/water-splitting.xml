      <title>Microwave sintering construct 3D NiFeAl micro/nano porous bulk electrode for effective oxygen evolution reaction</title>

      <description>Yang Yu, Xiaoyan Peng, J.L. Xu, Ge Gao, Ying Ma, Junming Luo, International journal of hydrogen energy. 67(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394871217

                The development of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an important strategy to produce hydrogen energy by water splitting. Based on the Kirkendall effect and the capillary action of Al melting, this paper introduced a proper amount of Al into NiFe, and the 3D porous bulk high-efficiency OER electrodes were successfully prepared by microwave sintering. The 3D porous structure can provide abundant active sites for OER. The porous channel accelerates the penetration of O2 and electrolyte, shortens the diffusion path of reagents and products, and reduces the charge transfer resistance. It is worth noting that the NiFeAl porous bulk electrode shows excellent OER performance. The overpotentials are 205 mV and 251 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 100 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, and the Tafel slope is as low as 39.3 mV dec&#8722;1. Due to the existence of Al in the electrode and continuous etching and reconstruction in 1 M KOH solution, the stability test of the electrode lasts for more than 80 h, and the stability rate is even as high as 99.6%. In this work, a new view is put forward in developing an efficient and stable OER electrocatalysts for the preparation of transition metals.</description>

                RuO2 is widely used as an acidic electrocatalyst to achieve high catalytic activity, but the severe leaching and scarcity of the Ru element restrict application on a large scale. Strategies such as designing nanostructures and adjusting metals' electronic properties to regulate the adsorption of reaction intermediates can be used for the design and preparation of catalysts. Herein, we designed an acid-treated RuO2/Co3O4 nanostructure electrocatalyst with low Ru content and an intimate heterogeneous interface to disrupt the trade-off relationship between stability and activity. The resulting acid-treated RuO2/Co3O4 displayed an overpotential of 152 mV in a 0.5 M H2SO4 electrolyte, greatly exceeding that of commercial RuO2 (221 mV). Despite continuous operation for 150 h, it still exhibited good stability with a degradation rate of 0.67 mV&#183;h&#8211;1. Multiple characterization analyses revealed that an electron transfer occurs from Ruoct to Cooct(III) sites through the mutual O atoms in acid-treated RuO2/Co3O4, which is further strengthened by the presence of oxygen vacancies. The oxygen vacancy and heterogeneous interface synergistically regulate electronic dispersion, optimize the adsorption of the oxygen intermediates (*OOH), and improve the reaction kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This work brings to light the significance of oxygen vacancies for modulating the electronic structure of RuO2 nanoparticles and enhancing stability on Co3O4 support, thus highlighting the use of nanostructure and interfacial engineering to achieve better acidic OER catalyst design.</description>

      <title>Directed electron transport induced surface reconstruction of 2D NiFe-LDH/Stanene heterojunction catalysts for efficient oxygen evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.124073</link>
      <description>Ze Sheng Lu, Jingkun Wang, Pengfei Zhang, Wenhao Guo, Yongqing Shen, Peizhi Liu, Jianlong Ji, Hao Du, Min Zhao, Hao&#8208;Jie Liang, Junjie Guo, Applied catalysis. B, Environmental. 353(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394872099

                As promising non-noble candidates for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), NiFe-based layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) has been proven to transform into its high-oxidation-state Ni/Fe oxyhydroxide, which act as the primary active sites. However, advancing the emergence of high-oxidation-state Ni/Fe oxyhydroxide during OER process currently remains a challenge. Herein, a novel 2D NiFe-LDH/stanene p-n junction catalyst is achieved by inserting stanene between NiFe-LDH and Ni foam. In-situ Raman spectra and density functional theory calculations (DFT) confirm that stanene not only benefits for the construction of built-in electric field, but also serves as an electron absorber to induce a directed electron transport from Ni, Fe to Sn, which thus facilitates the surface reconstruction to form the catalytically active Ni/FeOOH. Consequently, an ultralow OER overpotential (230 mV) at 100 mA cm-2 is achieved, corresponding to a considerable decrease of 22.3% and 42.1% compared with the individual NiFe-LDH and stanene, respectively. This work provides a promising avenue for the development of efficient OER catalysts for water electrolysis.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure Modulation Via Iron-Incorporated NiO to Boost Urea Oxidation/Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.4c00893</link>
      <description>Guohua He, Xiong-Fei He, Hui-Ying Mu, Ran Su, Yue Zhou, Chao Meng, F. Li, Xuemin Chen, Inorganic chemistry. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394874347

                The urea-assisted water splitting not only enables a reduction in energy consumption during hydrogen production but also addresses the issue of environmental pollution caused by urea. Doping heterogeneous atoms in Ni-based electrocatalysts is considered an efficient means for regulating the electronic structure of Ni sites in catalytic processes. However, the current methodologies for synthesizing heteroatom-doped Ni-based electrocatalysts exhibit certain limitations, including intricate experimental procedures, prolonged reaction durations, and low product yield. Herein, Fe-doped NiO electrocatalysts were successfully synthesized using a rapid and facile solution combustion method, enabling the synthesis of 1.1107 g within a mere 5 min. The incorporation of iron atoms facilitates the modulation of the electronic environment around Ni atoms, generating a substantial decrease in the Gibbs free energy of intermediate species for the Fe-NiO catalyst. This modification promotes efficient cleavage of C-N bonds and consequently enhances the catalytic performance of UOR. Benefiting from the tunability of the electronic environment around the active sites and its efficient electron transfer, Fe-NiO electrocatalysts only needs 1.334 V to achieve 50 mA cm-2 during UOR. Moreover, Fe-NiO catalysts were integrated into a dual electrode urea electrolytic system, requiring only 1.43 V of cell voltage at 10 mA cm-2.</description>

      <title>Hydrothermally synthesized rGO based FeSe nanocomposite as electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpcs.2024.112055</link>
      <description>Wajeeha Perveen, Haifa A. Alyousef, B. M. Alotaibi, Albandari W. Alrowaily, Khalid I. Hussein, A.M.A. Henaish, Journal of physics and chemistry of solids. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394875382

                Highly productive catalysts are necessary in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to lower overpotential and enhance sluggish kinetics of the reaction. In this work, we present an effective OER electrocatalyst, i.e. composite of FeSe with reduced graphene oxide (FeSe/rGO) fabricated via hydrothermal method. Its main challenges include low electron conductivity and inadequate active site exposure. Meanwhile, the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composite improves the conductivity, which raises OER activity and provides large electrochemical surface area. Different physical techniques were used to analyze the composite, according to BET surface area of FeSe/rGO was (201 cm3 g-1). To assess electrochemical characteristics of composite electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry was utilized. In comparison to benchmark of commercial RuO2, the FeSe/rGO catalyst exhibits a reduced overpotential (194 mV) and minimal Tafel slope (31 mV dec&#8722;1). FeSe/rGO exhibits exceptional stability and long-term durability to be used for OER. This work not only show low overpotential value of FeSe/rGO nanocomposite, but it also introduces a novel method for producing composite materials that are inexpensive and perform well and can be utilized in different future applications.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Highly Porous and Sheet Like Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;Carbon Nanocomposites: A Versatile Catalyst for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>

                Abstract Fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries are examples of renewable energy technologies that depend on having highly effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, a mesoporous nanostructure composed of Fe 3 O 4 &#8208;Carbon nanocomposites was synthesised using a simple and economically viable approach at a relatively low temperature. The observed catalytic activity of the prepared defected Fe 3 O 4 &#8208;Carbon nanocomposites mesoporous nanostructure was found to be remarkable. Additionally, the nanostructure exhibited a high tolerance to methanol and demonstrated durability towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. In the course of the experiment, it was observed that the catalyst exhibited noteworthy activity in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) when compared to the commercially available RuO 2 catalyst. This was evident through a more overpotential value of 325 mV at current density of 10 mA/cm 2 . The catalyst&#8216;s notable capacity for high oxygen reaction activity may potentially enhance the synergistic effect resulting from the combination of defect sites and the porous structure of Fe 3 O 4 &#8208;Carbon nanocomposites. The findings of this study indicate that the Fe 3 O 4 &#8208;Carbon nanocomposites nanostructures exhibit promising attributes as an electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in real&#8208;world scenarios.</description>

      <title>PBA-Derived Ternary FeCoNi Alloy Supported on N-Doped Porous Carbon as a Bifunctional Catalyst for Zn-Air Batteries</title>

                One of the challenges preventing rechargeable Zn-air batteries (ZABs) from being used in larger commercial applications is their slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Low-cost transition metal carbon-based materials are generally considered to be the most promising materials to replace precious metal catalysts to improve the OER and ORR performance. However, practical application of these materials is hampered by poor activity and stability. By optimization of the preparation technology and composition of the material, the catalytic activity and durability of the catalyst can be improved. Herein, through iterative coprecipitation and pyrolysis methods, FeCoNi alloy nanoparticles coated with graphitized carbon nanotubes (FeCoNi-N-CS) were constructed on activated carbon. The FeCoNi-N-CS exhibits impressive bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in alkaline media with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 871 mV for the ORR, an overpotential of 334 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 (Ej=10) for the OER. Furthermore, when this catalyst is applied in ZAB, a greater specific capacity of 791 mAh gZn&#8211;1 and long-term cycling stability compared to commercialized Pt/C + RuO2 can be achieved.</description>

                Green hydrogen resulting from water electrolysis is a key component for the transition to a renewable energy economy. However, it's success highly depends on active and stable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) which is the bottleneck reaction of water electrolysis. Herein we assess the OER performance of non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts comprising Co oxide/hydroxide and delaminated 2D transition metal carbide sheets, Ti3C2Tx MXene. The catalytically active sites are provided by Co oxide/hydroxide, while the MXene contributes exceptional electrical conductivity. Our comprehensive electrochemical evaluation of their OER performance reveals that the chemical functionalization of Co on MXene sheets outperforms the pure Co or MXene alone, as well as physically mixed materials, across all tested performance metrics. From the materials characterisation, the chemical functionalized Co/Ti3C2Tx materials exhibit increased formation of layered double hydroxide (LDH) Co(OH)2 structures compared to the pure Co and physically mixed materials which may result in the improved OER activity observed for these materials. These findings emphasize the potential of anchoring transition metal oxides/hydroxides on MXene as a superior OER electrocatalyst for advancing sustainable green hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>First&#8208;Principles Investigations on Effects of B&#8208;Site Substitution (B&#9552;Mn, Fe, and Co) on La&#8208;Based Perovskite Oxides As Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Rechargeable Metal&#8211;Air Batteries</title>

                Abstract The effects of B&#8208;site substitution (B&#9552;Mn, Fe, and Co) in La&#8208;based perovskite oxides (LPOs); LaMnO 3 , LaFeO 3 , LaCoO 3 , as bifunctional electrocatalysts during oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in metal&#8211;air batteries (MABs) under an alkaline electrolyte (pH = 13) are investigated using density functional theory (DFT). It is found that LaMnO 3 exhibits higher ORR activity than others with ORR overpotential ( &#951; ORR ) of 0.57 V, but its OER activity is poor with OER overpotential ( &#951; OER ) of 1.12 V. The &#951; ORR (0.59 V) and &#951; OER (1.13 V) of LaMn 0.75 Fe 0.25 O 3 closely resemble those of LaMnO 3 , suggesting that Fe substitution does not yield appreciable enhancements in activity. Fe substitution reduces the ORR and OER activity because the adsorption energies of intermediate species on Fe&#8208;substituted LPOs surfaces are too strong to obtain a potential determining step for ORR and OER. According to Sabatier's principle, the LaMn 0.25 Co 0.75 O 3 demonstrates superior OER activity compared to the other composition, while ORR activity approximates that of LaMnO 3 , evidenced by &#951; ORR of 0.65 V and &#951; OER of 0.53 V. The Co&#8208;terminated LaMn 0.25 Co 0.75 O 3 shows bifunctional activity higher than Mn/Co termination, indicating that Co is an active site for OER and Mn is a promoter for improved ORR activity.</description>

                Abstract Designing high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for the conversion and storage of sustainable energy technologies. Inspired by the biomineralization process, we utilized the phosphorylation sites of collagen molecules to combine with cobalt&#8208;based mononuclear precursors at the molecular level and built a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous hierarchical material through a bottom&#8208;up biomimetic self&#8208;assembly strategy to obtain single&#8208;atom catalysts confined on carbonized biomimetic self&#8208;assembled carriers (Co SACs/cBSC) after subsequent high&#8208;temperature annealing. In this strategy, the biomolecule improved the anchoring efficiency of the metal precursor through precise functional groups; meanwhile, the binding&#8208;then&#8208;assembling strategy also effectively suppressed the nonspecific adsorption of metal ions, ultimately preventing atomic agglomeration and achieving strong electronic metal&#8208;support interactions (EMSIs). Experimental characterizations confirm that binding forms between cobalt metal and carbonized self&#8208;assembled substrate (Co&#8211;O 4 &#8211;P). Theoretical calculations disclose that the local environment changes significantly tailored the Co d&#8208;band center, and optimized the binding energy of oxygenated intermediates and the energy barrier of oxygen release. As a result, the obtained Co SACs/cBSC catalyst can achieve remarkable OER activity and 24 h durability in 1 M KOH ( &#951; 10 at 288 mV; Tafel slope of 44 mV dec &#8722;1 ), better than other transition metal&#8208;based catalysts and commercial IrO 2 . Overall, we presented a self&#8208;assembly strategy to prepare transition metal SACs with strong EMSIs, providing a new avenue for the preparation of efficient catalysts with fine atomic structures.</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen (H 2 ) has been regarded as a promising alternative to fossil&#8208;fuel energy. Green H 2 produced via water electrolysis (WE) powered by renewable energy could achieve a zero&#8208;carbon footprint. Considerable attention has been focused on developing highly active catalysts to facilitate the reaction kinetics and improve the energy efficiency of WE. However, the stability of the electrocatalysts hampers the commercial viability of WE. Few studies have elucidated the origin of catalyst degradation. In this review, we first discuss the WE mechanism, including anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Then, we provide strategies used to enhance the stability of electrocatalysts. After that, the deactivation mechanisms of the typical commercialized HER and OER catalysts, including Pt, Ni, RuO 2 , and IrO 2 , are summarized. Finally, the influence of fluctuating energy on catalyst degradation is highlighted and in situ characterization methodologies for understanding the dynamic deactivation processes are described.</description>

                Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (R-P) perovskite oxides have attracted much attention as highly active and stable bifunctional materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline solutions due to the nonuse of precious metal elements. Herein, a triple (H+, O2&#8211;, and electron) conductive R-P perovskite oxide, La1.2Sr0.8Ni0.6Fe0.4O4+&#948;, was prepared, and the valence state of transition metal cations and highly oxidized oxygen (O&#8211;/O22&#8211;) in the structure was tuned by a low-temperature fluorine substitution treatment. The homogeneous distribution of the fluorine elements across the particles of the R-P perovskite oxide after its fluorination was confirmed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images. By regulation of the amount of highly oxidative state oxygen species and the valence state of transition metal cations in the R-P perovskite structure, the material exhibits a significant enhancement for both the OER and ORR electrocatalytic activities. The fluoridated La1.2Sr0.8Ni0.6Fe0.4O4+&#948;Fy (LSNF-OF) achieves a low OER overpotential of 308.1 mV in a 1 M KOH electrolyte at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2. This is superior to both commercial Co3O4 and the pristine sample without fluorination. The LSNF-OF electrode in an aqueous Zn-air battery (ZAB) exhibits a peak power density of 19.15 W g&#8211;1 at a current density of 24 mA g&#8211;1. The low-temperature trace fluorination can enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency of perovskite oxides. This technique can be applied to various types of metal oxides.</description>

                Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis is an area of increasing interest for the in&#8208;situ production of H2O2 or the development of energy&#8208;related devices such as hydrogen fuel cells. Although pyrolyzed catalysts still offer the best performances to date with reference to the organic&#8208;based catalysts, metal&#8208;free and non&#8208;pyrolyzed covalent organic frameworks (COFs) stands out as promising alternatives candidates due to their favourable characteristics such as crystallinity, porosity, and organic composition, allowing the study of structural&#8208;property relationships. Herein, we present the design principles and recent advances in COFs&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts, demonstrating how composition influences the activity and electronic pathway of the oxygen reduction process.</description>

                Local symmetry breaking of catalysts has emerged as an effective strategy for finely tuning oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, yet the fundamental comprehension regarding asymmetric structure-activity relationships remains limited. Here, we propose the energy band engineering to bridge the correlation between established asymmetric electronic structure and adsorption/desorption ability of reaction intermediates within metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The deliberate synthesis of CoM-MOFs (M=Cu, Ni, and Fe) with distinct coordination microenvironments enables the customization of asymmetric Co-O-M electronic structure. A volcano-shaped relationship can be revealed between calculated OER overpotential and average d-band center (Ed) energy level for both active Co sites and substituted M. The CoFe-MOF, located close to the summit, showcases the balanced reaction intermediate behavior and thus for enhanced OER activity. This work presents a promising approach to thoroughly understand asymmetric electronic structure-activity relationships from the perspective of energy band engineering and further guide the discovery of high-efficiency MOF-based OER catalysts.</description>

                Electrocatalysis is a promising method for removing harmful substances because it does not involve toxic agents and has low energy consumption. Herein, we have developed a low-cost nickel-tungsten dioxide (Ni/WO2) grown on carbon paper for the first time. Ni/WO2/CP demonstrates remarkable catalytic efficiency for the electrocatalytic oxidation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), achieving a conversion rate of 100 % within 3 h and a total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate of 57 %. After four reaction cycles, the electrode can still achieve a conversion rate of 90.49 %. The exceptional activity of Ni/WO2 could be attributed to the activation of lattice oxygen in WO2 by coupled Ni, leading to the generation of a significant amount of superoxide free radicals (O2&#8722;) and creating numerous oxygen vacancies that serve as the active sites for subsequent 2,4-D oxidation. This work highlights the impact of lattice oxygen on electrocatalytic oxidation and material modification, offering a noble metal-free catalyst for converting harmful substances.</description>

                In this study, we demonstrate that modifying p-type NiO nanodots (NDs) on n-type In2S3 nanosheet arrays (NSAs) photoanode can significantly boost its photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution. The NiO NDs are deposited onto the In2S3 NSAs surface via an easy and facile photodeposition method. The optimized In2S3/NiO NSAs/NDs photoanode displays drastically boosted PEC water splitting activity. The optimized In2S3/NiO NSAs/NDs photoanode exhibits 167 % enhancement in the maximum photocurrent density compared to that of undecorated In2S3 NSAs photoanode in neutral electrolyte at 0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Furthermore, in contrast with pure In2S3 NSAs photoanode, the In2S3/NiO NSAs/NDs photoanode exhibits a marked cathodic shift with a value of about 30 mV in the onset potential, substantially reducing water oxidation reaction energy barrier. And the photogenerated carriers of the In2S3 NSAs photoelectrode are efficiently transferred and separated in contrast with those of pure In2S3 NSAs photoelectrode. The present study offers a new strategy to enhance PEC water splitting performance of In2S3 photoanode through decreasing onset potential for water oxidation reaction.</description>

                Iron-doped cobalt-based nanomeshes have been synthesized in a one-pot methodology. 2-Methyl imidazole (2-HMIM) acted as an etchant, while high valent iron increased the acidity of the solution and helped to synthesize ultrathin (thickness 1.9&#8211;2.0 nm) two-dimensional (2D)-nanomeshes having small uniform mesopores (3.8&#8211;4.0 nm) on the basal plane with high surface area and high pore volume. 20% iron-doped nanomesh material (Co0.8Fe0.2(OH)x) revealed the best water oxidation reactivity, having an overpotential of 314 &#177; 3 mV, a mass activity of 413 &#177; 19 A/g, a turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.41 &#177; 0.04 s&#8211;1, and a TOFEIS of 4.15 &#177; 0.04 s&#8211;1. Electrochemical results suggested that the Co0.8Fe0.2(OH)x-nanomesh had a double-layer capacitance of 12.2 mF/cm2, corresponding to a roughness factor of 452, i.e., ion accessibility inside the nanomaterial was improved 452 times compared to the geometrical surface area of the electrode. This remarkable reactivity was due to (a) improved active sites for water oxidation at protruding edge sites and narrow mesopores on the basal planes of nanomeshes, (b) narrow mesopores on the basal planes ensured vertical ion penetration, vacant sites for water oxidation, and easy O2 release from the material, and (c) electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results suggested that nanomesh formation ensured fast charge propagation inside the nanomaterial during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and fast charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface.</description>

                The diversity of chemical environments present on unique crystallographic facets can drive dramatic differences in catalytic activity and the reaction mechanism. By coupling experimental investigations of five different IrO2 facets and theory, we characterize the detailed elemental steps of the surface redox processes and the rate-limiting processes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The predicted complex evolution of surface adsorbates and the associated charge transfer as a function of applied potential matches well with the distinct redox features observed experimentally for the five facets. Our microkinetic model from grand canonical quantum mechanics (GC-QM) calculations demonstrates mechanistic differences between nucleophilic attack and O&#8211;O coupling across facets, providing the rates as a function of applied potential. These GC-QM calculations explain the higher OER activity observed on the (100), (001), and (110) facets and the lower activity observed for the (101) and (111) facets. This combined study with theory and experiment brings new insights into the structural features that either promote or hinder the OER activity of IrO2, which are expected to provide parallels in structural effects on other oxide surfaces.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Catalyst Corrosion and Homogeneous Reactive Oxygen Species in Electrochemical Ozone Production</title>

                Electrochemical ozone production (EOP), a six-electron water oxidation reaction, offers promising avenues for creating value-added oxidants and disinfectants. However, progress in this field is slowed by a dearth of understanding of fundamental reaction mechanisms. In this work, we combine experimental electrochemistry, spectroscopic detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxygen-anion chemical ionization mass spectrometry, and computational quantum chemistry calculations to determine a plausible reaction mechanism on nickel- and antimony-doped tin oxide (Ni/Sb&#8211;SnO2, NATO), one of the most selective EOP catalysts. Antimony doping is shown to increase the conductivity of the catalyst, leading to improved electrochemical performance. Spectroscopic analysis and electrochemical experiments combined with quantum chemistry predictions reveal that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a critical reaction intermediate. We propose that leached Ni4+ cations catalyze hydrogen peroxide into solution phase hydroperoxyl radicals (&#8226;OOH); these radicals are subsequently oxidized to ozone. Isotopic product analysis shows that ozone is generated catalytically from water and corrosively from the catalyst oxide lattice without regeneration of lattice oxygens. Further quantum chemistry calculations and thermodynamic analysis suggest that the electrochemical corrosion of tin oxide itself might generate hydrogen peroxide, which is then catalyzed to ozone. The proposed pathways explain both the roles of dopants in NATO and its lack of stability. Our study interrogates the possibility that instability and electrochemical activity are intrinsically linked through the formation of ROS. In doing so, we provide the first mechanism for EOP that is consistent with computational and experimental results and highlight the central challenge of instability as a target for future research efforts.</description>

                Abstract In natural plants, Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster with metal&#8208;oxo &#8220;distorted chair&#8221;&#8208;like structure exhibits excellent oxygen evolution activity. However, the performance of biomimetic oxygen evolution catalysts based on the Mn 4 CaO 5 &#8208;like structure is far inferior to expectations. Herein, Ca and Ni are first doped together into birnessite and constructed a &#8220;distorted chair&#8221;&#8208;like structure unit Mn 4&#8208;x Ni x CaO 5 in a birnessite&#8208;like Ca&#8208;Mn(Ni)&#8208;O catalyst, the biomimetic Mn 4&#8208;x Ni x CaO 5 unit efficiently activates lattice oxygen and boosts the O&#9472;O coupling in oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which allows the catalyst to perform superior OER activity with an outstanding overpotential of 184 mV at 300 mA cm &#8722;2 . Besides, the birnessite&#8208;like Ca&#8208;Mn(Ni)&#8208;O catalyst is stabilized by coupling to NiMnO 3 nanoplate, thus forming a stable catalyst that can work for &gt;500 h without attenuation. This work optimizes biomimetic structures by introducing new elements, which provides new insight into developing efficient biomimetic materials.</description>

                Optimizing the local electronic structure of electrocatalysts can effectively lower the energy barrier of electrochemical reactions, thus enhancing the electrocatalytic activity. However, the intrinsic contribution of the electronic effect is still experimentally unclear. In this work, the electron injection-incomplete discharge approach to achieve the electron accumulation (EA) degree on the nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe LDH) is proposed, to reveal the intrinsic contribution of EA toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Such NiFe LDH with EA effect results in only 262 mV overpotential to reach 50 mA cm-2, which is 51 mV-lower compared with pristine NiFe LDH (313 mV), and reduced Tafel slope of 54.8 mV dec-1 than NiFe LDH (107.5 mV dec-1). Spectroscopy characterizations combined with theoretical calculations confirm that the EA near concomitant Vo can induce a narrower energy gap and lower thermodynamic barrier to enhance OER performance. This study clarifies the mechanism of the EA effect on OER activity, providing a direct electronic structure modulation guideline for effective electrocatalyst design.</description>

      <title>Diamondoid Ni(II) Coordination Polymer as an Electrocatalyst for Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution Reactions and Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/asia.202400218</link>

                We have successfully synthesized a new Ni(II)-based coordination polymer (CP) [Ni2(cis-1,4-chdc)2(4,4'-bpy)3(H2O)2] (1); (cis-1,4- H2chdc = cis-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid and 4,4'-bpy = 4,4'-bipyridine) employing slow diffusion method in a single pot technique. The connectivity of Ni(II) ions and bridging cis-1,4-chdc ligand gives rise to a three-dimensional (3D) framework with 2-fold interpenetrated diamondoid topology. Interestingly, the synthesized CP acts as efficient catalyst for electrocatalytic water splitting. The water oxidation activity of compound 1 exhibits Tafel slope equivalent to 361.48 mV.dec-1 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 353.53 mV.dec-1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline medium while almost similar values of Tafel slope for HER and OER equivalent to 287.33 mV.dec-1 and 289.93 mV.dec-1 respectively in acidic medium. Thus, the compound 1 has excellent efficacy in catalyzing HER and OER in acidic as well as alkaline medium, which is ascribed to its distinctive 3D architecture.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the most important components of various electrochemical systems such as water splitting, metal air batteries, and carbon dioxide reduction. However, the four-electron process of OER suffers from intrinsically sluggish kinetics, which contributes to significant overpotential in the electrochemical system. Herein, highly defective NiFeV layered triple hydroxide (LTH) catalyst was efficiently prepared using a one-step hydrothermal method. The crystal structure, electronic structure, and surface composition of NiFeV LTH were characterized by X-ray diffraction and photoelectron spectroscopy. Moreover, NiFeV LTH demonstrated a superior OER catalytic performance with-low overpotential (158 mV @10 mA&#183;cm -2 ), related small Tafel slope (102.3 mV&#183;dec &#8722;1 ), and long-term stability at a high current density of 100 mA&#183;cm -2 . In situ Raman spectroscopy was applied to investigate the surface reconstruction during the OER process. It is revealed that Ni species were the most active sites at low overpotential, with the potential increasing subsequently Fe and V gradually participates in the catalytic reaction, the Fe and Ni species as OER catalytic active sites lead to the excellent OER catalytic activity of NiFeV LTH, and inhibited the further dissolution of high-valence NiOOH at high overpotential. The mechanism induced the outstanding activity and stability at high current densities in NiFeV LTH system. Dissolution of vanadium excited the active sites of NiFeV LTH synthesized by hydrothermal method which promoted both activity and stability, while the changes of surface species at different OER potentials were detected by in situ Raman spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Pore Size-Regulated Vertically Aligned CoFe-LDH on a Carbon Support for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                Porous carbon-supported CoFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH)-based catalysts were synthesized and utilized as excellent oxygen evolution reaction catalysts in alkaline medium. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy images and N2-sorption experiments suggested vertical growth of LDH on the carbon support and a narrow mesoporous nature of the materials, respectively. We proposed that the surface oxygen functional groups of carbon materials provided the nucleation sites for the crystal growth of the LDH on the carbon support utilizing short-range electrostatic interactions, which led to vertical growth of LDH with a narrow mesoporous nature. Among the synthesized materials, CoFe-LDH/MMC showed a remarkable mass activity of 559.2 A g&#8211;1, a turnover frequency of 4.22 s&#8211;1, and a massive roughness factor value of 269. This excellent reactivity has been attributed to (a) the vertically aligned narrow mesoporous nature of the material that increased the electrolyte accessibility inside the material and thus improved active sites for catalysis, (b) the high electrical conductivity of the material that also enhanced accessibility, reduced resistance for charge transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and reduced resistance for intermediate formation during water oxidation, and (c) the increased electron contribution to the 3d orbital of cobalt from carbon that weakened the Co&#8211;oxygen bond and thus further facilitated the formation of the O&#8211;O bond and O2 desorption during water oxidation.</description>

                Abstract The discovery of Mn-Ca complex in photosystem II stimulates research of manganese-based catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, conventional chemical strategies face challenges in regulating the four electron-proton processes of OER. Herein, we investigate alpha-manganese dioxide (&#945;-MnO 2 ) with typical Mn IV -O-Mn III -H x O motifs as a model for adjusting proton coupling. We reveal that pre-equilibrium proton-coupled redox transition provides an adjustable energy profile for OER, paving the way for in-situ enhancing proton coupling through a new &#8220;reagent&#8221;&#8212; external electric field. Based on the &#945;-MnO 2 single-nanowire device, gate voltage induces a 4-fold increase in OER current density at 1.7 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, the proof-of-principle external electric field-assisted flow cell for water splitting demonstrates a 34% increase in current density and a 44.7 mW/cm&#178; increase in net output power. These findings indicate an in-depth understanding of the role of proton-incorporated redox transition and develop practical approach for high-efficiency electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Exploring the High-Entropy Oxide Composition Space: Insights through Comparing Experimental with Theoretical Models for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c05915</link>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is key for the transition to a hydrogen-based energy economy. The observed activity of the OER catalysts arises from the combined effects of surface area, intrinsic activity, and stability. Therefore, alloys provide an effective platform to search for catalysts that balance these factors. In particular, high-entropy oxides provide a vast material composition space that could contain catalysts with optimal OER performance. In this work, the OER performance of the AuIrOsPdPtReRhRu composition space was modeled using an experimentally obtained dataset of 350 nanoparticles. This machine-learned model based on experimental data found the optimal catalyst to be a mixture of AuIrOsPdRu. However, as a "black-box model", it cannot explain the underlying chemistry. Therefore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to provide a complementary theoretical model with defined assumptions and, hence, a physical interpretation through comparison with the experimental model. The DFT calculations suggest that the majority of the activity originates from Ru and Ir active sites and that the addition of Pd improves the performance of these sites. However, the DFT calculation did not find the experimentally observed beneficial effects of Au and Os. Therefore, we hypothesize that the Os contributed to the performance of the tested catalysts by roughening the surface, whereas Au fulfilled the role of a structural support. Overall, it is demonstrated how machine learning can help accelerate catalyst discovery, and combining machine-learned models obtained from experimental data with models based on DFT calculations can provide important insights into the complex chemistry of OER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Stably Improving the Catalytic Activity of Oxygen Evolution Reactions via Two-Dimensional Graphene Oxide-Incorporated NiFe-Layered Double Hydroxides</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14040278</link>
      <description>Chen Ling, Yonglai Lu, Manman Duanmu, Xin Zhao, Shenglu Song, Liangtao Duan, Zhipeng Ma, Ailing Song, Guangjie Shao, Catalysts. 14(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394956887

                NiFe-layered double hydroxides (NiFe-LDH) have been reported to possess exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. However, maintaining the stability of high activity over a long time remains a critical challenge that needs to be addressed for their practical application. Here, we report a custom-sized deep recombination of 2D graphene oxide with NiFe-LDH (NiFe-LDH/GO/NF) through a simple electrodeposition method that improves OER activity and achieves excellent stability. The excellent performance of the catalyst mainly comes from the three-phase interface and electron transport channel dredged by the three-dimensional structure constructed by the deep composite, which can not only significantly reduce its charge and electron transfer resistance, improving the material conductivity, but it also effectively increases the specific surface area, inhibits aggregation, and exposes rich active sites. In addition, GO with good conductivity not only supports NiFe-LDH well but also increases the heterogeneous interface, putting the NiFe-LDH/GO composites in close contact with Ni foam and increasing the electrocatalytic stability of the NiFe-LDH/GO/NF. The experimental results show that the overpotential of NiFe-LDH/20,000GO/NF is only 295 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2; the Tafel slope is 52 mV dec&#8722;1, and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) is only 0.601 &#937; in 1 M KOH. This indicates that GO has excellent potential to assist in constructing geometric and electronic structures of NiFe-LDH in long-term applications.</description>

      <title>Boosting Oxygen Evolution Activity of BiVO4 Photoanodes via Caffeic Acid Bridged to NiFeOOH</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apcatb.2024.124096</link>

                Bismuth vanadate (BiVO4) is a promising n-type photoanode material for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. However, its activity is impeded by poor charge carrier transport and sluggish oxygen evolution kinetics. In this study, we reports a Fe doping and caffeic acid (CA)/NiFeOOH (NiFe) modification with BiVO4 photoanode (NiFe/CA/Fe-BiVO4) to enhance the PEC water oxidation performance and stability. The modified BiVO4 demonstrates significant advantages in promoting the PEC performance and stability. Specifically, Fe doping via in-situ electro-deposition results in smaller crystal sizes, larger specific surface areas, and more exposed active sites. Furthermore, co-catalyst NiFe connects with Fe-BiVO4 through CA bridge facilitates a more uniform self-assembly distribution of NiFe on BiVO4 surface. The NiFe/CA/Fe-BiVO4 exhibits an excellent photocurrent density of 6.2 mA/cm2 and demonstrates good stability at 0.8 VRHE. In addition, the composite photoanode shows a high applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) value of 2.15% at 0.65 VRHE. EPR and in-situ FTIR confirm the generation of superoxide active species (O2- and &#183;O2-) during the PEC water oxidation reaction.</description>

                The potential for sustainable energy and carbon neutrality has expanded with the development of a highly active electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Covalent Organic Frameworks (COF) have recently garnered attention because of their enormous potential in a number of cutting-edge application sectors, such as gas storage, sensors, fuel cells, and active catalytic supports. A simple and effective COF constructed and integrated by post-alteration plasma modification facilitates high electrocatalytic OER activity under alkaline conditions. Variations in parameters such as voltage and treatment duration have been employed to enhance the factor that demonstrates high OER performance. The overpotential and Tafel slope are the lowest of all when using an optimized parameter, such as plasma treatment for 30 min utilizing 6 kV of voltage, PT-30 COF, measuring 390 mV at a current density of 10 mA.cm-2 and 69 mV.dec-1, respectively, as compared to 652 mV and 235 mV.dec-1 for the Pristine-COF. Our findings provide a method for broadening the scope by post-functionalizing the parent framework for effective water splitting.</description>

                The development of highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts based on more cost-effective and earth-abundant elements is of great significance and still faces a huge challenge. In this work, a series of transition metal (TM) embedding a newly-defined monolayer carbon nitride phase is theoretically profiled and constructed as a catalytic platform for OER studies. Typically, a four-step screening strategy was proposed to rapidly identified high performance candidates and the coordination structure and catalytic performance relationship was thoroughly analyzed. Moreover, the eliminating criterion was established to condenses valid range based on the Gibbs free energy of OH*. Our results reveal that the as-constructed 2FeCN/P exhibits superior activity toward OER with an ultralow overpotential of 0.25 V, at the same time, the established 3FeCN/S configuration performed well as a bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalysis with extremely low overpotential &#951;OER/&#951;ORR of 0.26/0.48 V.

                Electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are two important half-cell reactions for overall water splitting. The rational design and fabrication of efficient electrocatalysts involving nonprecious-metals and carbon matrix is highly attractive. Herein, a series of N-doped carbon nanotubes encapsulated FeNi alloy nanoparticles (FeNi@NCNTs) are synthesized via a simple pyrolysis treatment of Fe-doped Ni(OH)2 precursors under the assistance of dicyandiamine source. The results reveal that the Fe/Ni ratio has an obvious influence on the morphology and phase composition of FeNi@NCNTs series, thus affecting the electrocatalytic performance. The highest electrocatalytic activity is achieved for the Fe1Ni4@NCNTs product with a Fe/Ni molar ratio of 1:4, which delivers low overpotentials of 278 and 279 mV for OER and HER at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.0 mol/L KOH, respectively. The intriguing electrocatalytic performance is mainly ascribed to the advantageous integration of rambutan-like hierarchically porous structure and composition optimization, significantly facilitating the fast mass/charge transfer as well as promoting the adsorption ability for intermediates. The present method may open a facile avenue for developing cost-effective, high-activity, and stable electrocatalysts for the application of overall water splitting.</description>

                We provide the rational design of dual atom catalysts (DACs) supported on nitrogen-doped graphene for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER) through high-throughput computational screening of M1M2N6-DAC systems, where M1 and M2 represent Fe, Co, Ni, Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, or Pt metals. We predict that FeRuN6-DAC at the summit of the volcano plot exhibits a low theoretical ORR overpotential (&#951;ORR) of 0.24 V and a low theoretical OER overpotential (&#951;OER) of 0.19 V. The low &#951;ORR and &#951;OER result from the catalytic performance of the Fe site being tuned to electronic properties that facilitate adsorption and desorption of the OH&#8270; intermediate. Inspired by these hybrid density functional theory (DFT) computational and machine learning (ML) results, we synthesized FeRuN6-DAC, FeN4-SAC, and RuN4-SAC and characterized them using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and in-situ electron spin resonance (ESR). Our in-situ ESR spectroscopy signifies that the spin of the Fe active site increases with increasing applied potential due to the increase in the concentration of OH&#8270; intermediate on Fe. We verified experimentally the predicted catalytic performances, finding that FeRuN6-DAC leads to an experimental ORR overpotential of 0.29 V with a Tafel slope of 104 mVdec-1 and an OER overpotential of 0.27 V and a Tafel slope of 124 mVdec-1. The rechargeable Zinc-air battery setup was fabricated with FeRuN6-DAC in place of the cathode, showing a maximum power density of 0.45 W/cm2 at the current density of 0.44 A/cm2 and good stability after 120 cycles. According to our findings, we demonstrate that DFT-guided strategies are useful for designing advanced DACs applicable to ORR, OER, and Zinc-air battery applications.</description>

                Hydrogen is one of the most promising green energy alternatives due to its high gravimetric energy density, zero-carbon emissions, and other advantages. In this work, a CoFeBP micro-flower (MF) electrocatalyst is fabricated as an advanced water-splitting electrocatalyst by a hydrothermal approach for hydrogen production with the highly efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The fabrication process of the CoFeBP MF electrocatalyst is systematically optimized by thorough investigations on various hydrothermal synthesis and post-annealing parameters. The best optimized CoFeBP MF electrode demonstrates HER/OER overpotentials of 20 mV and 219 mV at 20 mA/cm2. The CoFeBP MFs also exhibit a low 2-electrode (2-E) cell voltage of 1.60 V at 50 mA/cm2, which is comparable to the benchmark electrodes of Pt/C and RuO2. The CoFeBP MFs demonstrate excellent 2-E stability of over 100 h operation under harsh industrial operational conditions at 60 &#176;C in 6 M KOH at a high current density of 1000 mA/cm2. The flower-like morphology can offer a largely increased electrochemical active surface area (ECSA), and systematic post-annealing can lead to improved crystallinity in CoFeBP MFs.</description>

                Abstract Green hydrogen production is crucial for a sustainable future, but current catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) suffer from slow kinetics, despite many efforts to produce optimal designs, particularly through the calculation of descriptors for activity. In this study, we develop a dataset of density functional theory calculations of bulk and surface perovskite oxides, and adsorption energies of OER intermediates, which includes compositions up to quaternary and facets up to (555). We demonstrate that per-site properties of perovskite oxides such as Bader charge or band center can be tuned through element substitution and faceting, and develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts these properties directly from the local chemical environment. We leverage these per-site properties to identify promising perovskites with high theoretical OER activity. The identified design principles and promising materials provide a roadmap for closing the gap between current artificial catalysts and biological enzymes such as photosystem II.</description>

                We developed a molybdenum (Mo)&#8208;doped cobalt (Co)&#8208;heterostructure embedded on a phosphorous (P) and nitrogen (N) dual&#8208;doped porous carbon which exhibits an intrinsic electronic transport channel of Co to Mo and P. The P,Mo,O&#8208;Co/PNC/NF (NF = Nickel foam) electrode offers 335 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 in OER as compared with PMA&#8208;ZIF67&#8208;NC/NF and ZIF67&#8208;NC/NF electrode with an overpotential of 357 and 373 mV respectively. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) of overall water splitting (OWS) supports that the current density gradually increased at a cell potential of 1.6 V with a maximum of 40 mA with a corresponding cell potential of 1.79 V at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations for water adsorption on optimized [111] surface of Co, CoMo, and CoMoP2 with adsorbed H2O and corresponding lattice determine the electron density difference of [111] surface with adsorbed H2O for Eads (eV) 4.23 corresponds to adsorption energy for CoMoP2. XANE&#8208;EXAFS spectroscopy of P,Mo,O&#8208;Co/PNC at Co K edge and Mo K edge suggests the presence of higher valence of both Cox+ and Mox+ without metallic Co and Mo and Co&#8208;P and Mo&#8208;P bonds as major structural units due to phosphidation as determined by R&#8208;space FT&#8208;EXAFS spectra.</description>

Concurrently, there is a pressing need for the development of pH-universal and economically viable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In response to these intertwined challenges, this study proposes an innovative approach wherein the amino groups present on the surface of chrome shavings are utilized to immobilize single ruthenium atoms during pyrolysis, thereby facilitating the synthesis of hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts. The optimized sample, denoted as CN/Cr2O3/Ru-1, demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic performance, exhibiting an ultra-low overpotential of -28 mV in 1.0 M KOH at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, and it also exhibits good performance in acidic and neutral electrolytes. Importantly, these overpotentials surpass those reported for many previous ruthenium-based catalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that both oxygen (O) and chromium (Cr) moieties within Cr2O3 can engage in favorable interactions with the coordination patterns of the ruthenium (Ru) atoms, thereby elucidating the synergistic enhancement conferred by the chromium element in CN/Cr2O3/Ru, which ultimately facilitates and promotes the catalytic activity of the ruthenium atoms serving as the catalytic center. This facile synthesis route not only presents a green solution for addressing waste chromium pollutants but also offers a promising avenue for the development of high-performance, cost-efficient electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract Optimization of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) has become a focus of researchers looking for a reliable way to generate power. A vital component to PEMWE operation is the porous transport layer (PTL) on the anode side, which is where oxygen is produced. The PTL must allow water access to the catalyst layer and remove oxygen simultaneously. In this work, a previously developed imaging technique is used to generate bilayer PTL structures. A multiscale modeling approach was used to study the effect of a bilayer PTL on oxygen evolution and PEMWE performance. First, a micro scale model was used to predict oxygen transport pathways through different PTL structures. Results showed that the bilayer PTL results in higher oxygen saturation and faster oxygen transport through the PTL. Second, a macro scale model was used to predict performance using bilayer PTLs. Predictions showed potential values between 10 and 20 mV below single layer potential values. This points to the bilayer improving PEMWE operation. Findings from this work show how the addition of a mesoporous layer to a PTL substrate will improve oxygen transport and removal from the catalyst surface, which will improve PEMWE performance.</description>

                The oxygen evolution reaction is the primary obstacle in the electrochemical breakdown of water; whereas transition metal selenides exhibit remarkable OER activity, their stability is compromised by the oxidative dissolution of selenium. The high-entropy materials can provide a feasible strategy to solve this problem due to their multi-element synergy and entropy stabilization effect. Here, we designed novel high-entropy MnCoCuZnAlSe2 electrocatalysts with ultra-low overpotential (190 mV@10 mA cm-2) and exceptional endurance (500 h@10 mA cm-2), which outperform other selenide and IrO2 catalysts. The high entropy effect was experimentally confirmed to inhibit selenium dissolution and improve the stability of transition metal selenides. Calculations using Density Functional Theory suggest that cobalt is actually MnCoCuZnAlSe2's true active center. The extraordinary OER properties of high-entropy selenides offer great opportunities for the design of ideal catalysts for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Carbon nitride interlayer-enhanced TiO2/WO3 nanorods with surface oxygen vacancies for durable photocathodic performance on 304 stainless steel in simulated seawater</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.151533</link>
      <description>Wenhan Zu, Guotao Pan, Jianhua Li, Sengyan Wang, Guoge Zhang, Liang Yin, Yan Liu, Chemical engineering journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4395014724

                To achieve a long-term photocathodic protective effect on metals in the marine environment, efficient charge mobility and electron storage are essential. Herein, we develop an oxygen vacancy (VO)-involved TiO2-wrapped WO3 nanorod composite by PPy-derived carbon nitride interlayer (TiO2/CNx/WO3) for the photoelectrochemical cathodic protection of 304SS in 3.5 % NaCl solution. The introduced CNx can serve not only as an electron channel to accelerate carrier migration but also as an efficient reductant to generate VO at the interfaces of TiO2 and WO3 during crystallization. The incorporated VO tunes the electronic structure and produces the mid-gap states, which lower the energy barrier for electron-hole separation. Meanwhile, WO3 nanorods as an electron self-storage pool make the photocathodic protection functional in darkness. Consequently, the as-prepared TiO2/CNx/WO3 photoanode yields a photocurrent density of 18.23 &#956;A&#183;cm&#8722;2 and a photoinduced cathodic polarization potential of &#8722;306 mV in simulated seawater. Even in the absence of light illustration, it can polarize 304SS to approximately &#8722;200 mV and continuously to 300 mV after 12 h. This work will offer a universal strategy for the rational design and fabrication of highly efficient semiconductor composite materials in the field of photocathodic anticorrosion.</description>

      <title>Effect of Precursor and Calcination Time on the Morphological Structure and Catalytic Activity of Co3O4 Film in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.15625/0868-3166/18878</link>

                This research investigates the effect of cobalt precursor and calcination time on the morphology and catalytic activity of Co3O4 films in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Co3O4 films with porous flower-like nanostructures were obtained using cobalt nitrate as a cobalt precursor, while cobalt chlorides were used to produce porous nanoneedle structures Co3O4 film. Extended annealing time at temperatures 350&#176;C caused structural fractures in the films. Among the samples, the synthesized Co3O4 films were then evaluated as catalyst materials for the OER in alkaline 1M KOH electrolyte. Among synthesized films, the Co3O4-2-1h, synthesized using the cobalt chlorides as Co precursor and annealed at 350&#176;C for 1 hour, exhibited better OER catalytic activity. With its porous nanoneedle structure, the Co3O4-2-1h demonstrated superior performance comparable to the state-of-the-art 20% Ir/C catalyst. Moreover, the Co3O4-2-1h film demonstrates remarkable stability for the OER in a 1M KOH alkaline electrolyte.</description>

                The nature of the active sites of transition metal oxides during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) has attracted much attention. Herein, we constructed well-defined nickel oxide/Au (111) model catalysts to study the relationship between the structures and their OER activity using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electrochemical measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The deposited nickel oxides on Au (111) were found to exhibit a two-dimensional (2D)/three-dimensional (3D) structure by regulating the annealing temperature. Combining STM, XPS and electrochemical measurements, our results demonstrated an optimal OER reactivity could be achieved for NiOx with a 2D structure on Au and provided a morphological description of the active phase during electrocatalysis.</description>

                Abstract Perovskite materials that aren't stable during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are unsuitable for anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWE). But through manipulating their electronic structures, their performance can further increase. Among the first&#8208;row transition metals, nickel and iron are widely recognized as prominent electrocatalysts; thus, the researchers are looking into how combining them can improve the OER. Recent research has actively explored the design and study of heterostructures in this field, showcasing the dynamic exploration of innovative catalyst configurations. In this study, a heterostructure is used to manipulate the electronic structure of LaNiO 3 (LNO) to improve both OER properties and durability. Through adsorbing iron onto the LNO (LNO@Fe) as &#947; iron oxyhydroxide (&#947;&#8208;FeOOH), the binding energy of nickel in the LNO exhibited negative shifts, inferring nickel movement toward the metallic state. Consequently, the electrochemical properties of LNO@Fe are further improved. LNO@Fe showed excellent performance (1.98 A cm &#8722;2 , 1 m KOH, 50 &#176;C at 1.85 V) with 84.1% cell efficiency in AEMWE single cells, demonstrating great improvement relative to LNO. The degradation for the 850 h durability analysis of LNO@Fe is &#8776;68 mV kh &#8722;1 , which is &#8776;58 times less than that of LNO.</description>

                Abstract Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LLO) hold great promise as cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to their unique oxygen redox (OR) chemistry, which enables additional capacity. However, the LLOs face challenges related to the instability of their OR process due to the weak transition metal (TM)&#8208;oxygen bond, leading to oxygen loss and irreversible phase transition that results in severe capacity and voltage decay. Herein, a synergistic electronic regulation strategy of surface and interior structures to enhance oxygen stability is proposed. In the interior of the materials, the local electrons around TM and O atoms may be delocalized by surrounding Mo atoms, facilitating the formation of stronger TM&#9472;O bonds at high voltages. Besides, on the surface, the highly reactive O atoms with lone pairs of electrons are passivated by additional TM atoms, which provides a more stable TM&#9472;O framework. Hence, this strategy stabilizes the oxygen and hinders TM migration, which enhances the reversibility in structural evolution, leading to increased capacity and voltage retention. This work presents an efficient approach to enhance the performance of LLOs through surface&#8208;to&#8208;interior electronic structure modulation, while also contributing to a deeper understanding of their redox reaction.</description>

                Supported metal catalysts with appropriate metal&#8208;support interactions (MSIs) hold a great promise for heterogeneous catalysis. However, ensuring tight immobilization of metal clusters/nanoparticles on the support while maximizing the exposure of surface active sites remains a huge challenge. Herein, we report an Ir/WO3 catalyst with a new enrooted&#8208;type MSI in which Ir clusters are, unprecedentedly, atomically enrooted into the WO3 lattice. The enrooted Ir atoms decrease the electron density of the constructed interface compared to the adhered (root&#8208;free) type, thereby achieving appropriate adsorption toward oxygen intermediates, ultimately leading to high activity and stability for oxygen evolution in acidic media. Importantly, this work provides a new enrooted&#8208;type supported metal catalyst, which endows suitable MSI and maximizes the exposure of surface active sites in contrast to the conventional adhered, embedded, and encapsulated types.</description>

                Abstract Heterogeneous catalysts have attracted extensive attention among various emerging catalysts for their exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) capabilities, outperforming their single&#8208;component counterparts. Nonetheless, the synthesis of heterogeneous materials with predictable, precise, and facile control remains a formidable challenge. Herein, a novel strategy involving the decoration of catalysts with CeO 2 is introduced to concurrently engineer heterogeneous interfaces and adjust phase composition, thereby enhancing OER performance. Theoretical calculations suggest that the presence of ceria reduces the free energy barrier for the conversion of nitrides into metals. Supporting this, the experimental findings reveal that the incorporation of rare earth oxides enables the controlled phase transition from nitride into metal, with the proportion adjustable by varying the amount of added rare earth. Thanks to the role of CeO 2 decoration in promoting the reaction kinetics and fostering the formation of the genuine active phase, the optimized Ni 3 FeN/Ni 3 Fe/CeO 2 &#8208;5% nanoparticles heterostructure catalyst exhibits outstanding OER activity, achieving an overpotential of just 249 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . This approach offers fresh perspectives for the conception of highly efficient heterogeneous OER catalysts, contributing a strategic avenue for advanced catalytic design in the field of energy conversion.</description>

                Abstract There is a rising need to create high&#8208;performing, affordable electrocatalysts in the new field of oxygen electrochemistry. Here, a cost&#8208;effective, activity&#8208;modulated electrocatalyst with the capacity to trigger both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline environment is presented. The catalyst (Al, Co/N&#8208;rGCNT) is made up of aluminium, nitrogen&#8208;dual&#8208;doped reduced graphene oxide sheets co&#8208;existing with cobalt&#8208;encapsulated carbon nanotube units. Based on X&#8208;ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) studies, it is established that the superior reaction kinetics in Al, Co/N&#8208;rGCNT over their bulk counterparts can be attributed to their electronic regulation. The Al, Co/N&#8208;rGCNT performs as a versatile bifunctional electrocatalyst for zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB), delivering an open circuit potential &#8776;1.35 V and peak power density of 106.3 mW cm &#8722;2 , which are comparable to the system based on Pt/C. The Al, Co/N&#8208;rGCNT&#8208;based system showed a specific capacity of 737 mAh g Zn &#8722;1 compared to 696 mAh g Zn &#8722;1 delivered by the system based on Pt/C. The DFT calculations indicate that the adsorption of Co in the presence of Al doping in NGr improves the electronic properties favoring ORR. Thus, the Al, Co/N&#8208;rGCNT&#8208;based rechargeable ZAB (RZAB) emerges as a highly viable and affordable option for the development of RZAB for practical applications.</description>

                Supported metal catalysts with appropriate metal&#8208;support interactions (MSIs) hold a great promise for heterogeneous catalysis. However, ensuring tight immobilization of metal clusters/nanoparticles on the support while maximizing the exposure of surface active sites remains a huge challenge. Herein, we report an Ir/WO3 catalyst with a new enrooted&#8208;type MSI in which Ir clusters are, unprecedentedly, atomically enrooted into the WO3 lattice. The enrooted Ir atoms decrease the electron density of the constructed interface compared to the adhered (root&#8208;free) type, thereby achieving appropriate adsorption toward oxygen intermediates, ultimately leading to high activity and stability for oxygen evolution in acidic media. Importantly, this work provides a new enrooted&#8208;type supported metal catalyst, which endows suitable MSI and maximizes the exposure of surface active sites in contrast to the conventional adhered, embedded, and encapsulated types.</description>

      <title>Pioneering molecularly-level Fe sites immobilized on graphene quantum dots as a key activity descriptor in achieving highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                The emergence of efficient electrocatalysts to facilitate the thermodynamically demanding and kinetically challenging oxygen evolution process (OER), which includes the coordinated transfer of four protons and four electrons, remains an issue. The effective transfer of energy encourages molecular-level control over key redox transitions involving small-molecule substrates (O2, and H2O), at or near electrode surfaces. While many molecular catalysts have been shown highly active for OER, immobilizing those onto the heterogenous solid matrices is challenging. Herein, graphene quantum dots (GQDs), a carbonaceous sub-class, was used as the solid matrices to conjugate the molecular catalyst onto its surface owing to its high surface area and electronic conductivity. Through the coordinated environment of the conjugated material, the molecular Fe sites on the GQDs surface exhibited outstanding OER features, achieving an ultra-low overpotential of 223 mV and 241 mV at a current density of 50 and 100 and mA/cm2, respectively, and excellent stability over 24 h. Our results marked a pioneering step in that through conjugation, these molecular sites were well dispersed at the GQDs matrices and were intrinsically active for OER.</description>

      <title>Microstructure and Texture Evolution in Cold&#8208;Rolled and Annealed Oxygen&#8208;Free Copper Sheets</title>

                The commercial oxygen-free copper sheets were cold-rolled with reduction rates ranging from 20% to 87% reduction rate and annealed at 400, 500 and 600 &#176;C. The microstructure and texture evolution during cold-rolling and annealing processes were studied using optical microscopy (OM), the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD). The results show that the deformation textures of {123} (S) , {112} (Copper) and {110} (Brass) were continuously enhanced with the increase of cold-rolling reduction. The orientations along the &#945;-oriented fiber converged towards Brass and the orientation density of &#946; fiber obviously increased when the rolling reduction exceeded 60%. The recrystallization texture was significantly affected by the cold-rolling reduction. After 60% cold-rolling reduction, Copper and S textures components gradually decreased and {011} recrystallization texture component formed with the increase of annealing temperature. After 87% cold-rolling reduction, a strong Cube texture formed and other textures were inhibited with the increase of annealing temperature. The strong Brass and S deformation texture was conducive to the formation of a strong Cube annealing texture. The density of annealing twin boundary decreased with the increase of annealing temperature, and more annealing twin boundaries formed in the oxygen-free copper sheets with the increase of cold rolling reduction.</description>

      <title>Ecotoxicity of 2,4-Dichlorophenol to Microsorium pteropus by High Spatial Resolution Mapping of Stoma Oxygen Emission</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/w16081146</link>

                The toxicity of emerging organic pollutants to photosystems of aquatic plants is still not well clarified. This study aimed to develop a novel ecotoxicological experimental protocol based on nanoscale electrochemical mapping of photosynthetic oxygen evolution of aquatic plants by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). The protocol was also checked by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), the traditional Clark oxygen electrode method, and the chlorophyll fluorescence technique. The typical persistent organic pollutant 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) in a water environment and the common aquatic Microsorium pteropus (M. pteropus) were chosen as the model organic pollutant and tested plant, respectively. It was found that the SECM method could discriminate the responses of stoma micromorphology and spatial pattens of photosynthetic oxygen evolution on single stoma well. The shape of stoma blurred with increasing 2,4-DCP concentration, which was in good agreement with the CLSM images. The dose&#8211;response curves and IC50 values obtained from the SECM data were verified by the data measured by the traditional Clark oxygen electrode method and chlorophyll fluorescence test. The IC50 value of single-stoma oxygen emission of plant leaves exposed for 24 h, which was derived from the SECM current data (32,535 &#956;g L&#8722;1), was close to those calculated from the maximum photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) measured by the chlorophyll fluorescence test (33,963 &#956;g L&#8722;1) and the Clark oxygen electrode method photosynthetic oxygen evolution rate (32,375 &#956;g L&#8722;1). The 72 h and 96 h 2,4-DCP exposure data further confirmed the reliability of the nanoscale stoma oxygen emission mapping methodology for ecotoxicological assessment. In this protocol, the procedures for how to collect effective electrochemical data and how to extract useful information from the single-stoma oxygen emission pattern were well established. This study showed that SECM is a feasible and reliable ecotoxicological tool for evaluation of toxicity of organic pollutants to higher plants with a unique nanoscale visualization advantage over the conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Investigating the potential use of Ni&#8208;Mn&#8208;Co (NMC) battery materials as electrocatalysts for electrochemical water splitting</title>

                The imminent generation of significant amounts of Li ion battery waste is of concern due to potential detrimental environmental impacts. However, this also poses an opportunity to recycle valuable battery materials for later use. One underexplored area is using commonly employed cathode materials such as nickel, manganese cobalt (NMC) oxide as an electrocatalyst for water splitting reactions. In this work we explore the possibility of using NMC materials of different metallic ratios (NMC 622 and 811) as oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution catalysts under alkaline conditions. We show that both materials are excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts but perform poorly for the hydrogen evolution reaction. NMC 622 demonstrates the better OER activity with an overpotential of only 280 mV to pass 100 mA cm&#8208;2 and a low tafel slope of 42 mV dec&#8208;1. The material can also pass high current densities of 150 mA cm&#8208;2 for 24 h while also being tolerant to extensive potential cycling indicating suitability for direct integration with renewable energy inputs. This work demonstrates that NMC cathode materials if recovered from Li ion batteries are suitable OER electrocatalysts.</description>

                In this work, we studied the effect of dimethylsulfone concentrations on the rate of anodic oxygen evolution and cathodic hydrogen evolution on a platinum electrode in acidic and alkaline media. By the method of calculating the DFT electron density functional at the level of the B97-3c theory using the Orca 4.2.0 program, the dimethyl sulfone bond breaking energy on the surface of platinum will be preferable through C-S bonds, according to the ion-radical mechanism. It has been confirmed by NMR and Raman spectroscopy that the end products of the anodic oxidation of dimethylsulfone in an acidic medium are methanesulfonic acid and dimethyldisulfone, in an alkaline medium - only dimethyldisulfone; the end products of cathodic reduction of DMSO2 are dimethylpolysulfides. Based on the obtained experimental results, a scheme of the electrocatalytic behavior of dimethylsulfone on a platinum electrode is proposed.</description>

                Amorphous materials feature unique structures and physicochemical properties, resulting in their synthesis and applications becoming a dynamic and fascinating new research direction. The high specific surface area, abundant active sites, and good electron transport properties endow amorphous materials with excellent electrocatalytic properties, thus appealing to increasing attention. Based on this, the summary of the current research status of amorphous catalysts in the field of electrocatalysis is urgent and important. In this review, the research progress of amorphous catalysts in electrocatalysis is systematically introduced, focusing on the classification, synthesis methods, modification strategies, characterizations, and electrocatalytic application (including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, and nitrogen reduction reaction). Finally, this review proposes the prospects and challenges for the future development of high-active and high-selectivity amorphous electrocatalysts.</description>

                While water's oxygen is the electron source in the industrially important oxygen evolution reaction, the strong absorber problem clouds our view of how the Stern layer water molecules orient themselves in response to applied potentials. Here, we report nonlinear optical measurements on nickel electrodes held at pH 13 indicating a disorder-to-order transition in the Stern layer water molecules prior to the onset of Faradaic current. A full water monolater (1.1 x 10^15 cm-2) aligns with oxygen atoms pointing towards the electrode at +0.8 V and the associated work is 80 kJ mol-1. Our experiments identify water flipping energetics as a target for understanding overpotentials, advance molecular electrochemistry, provide benchmarks for electrical double layer models, and serve as a diagnostic tool for understanding electrocatalysis.</description>

                This work develops a novel perovskite Sr2FeNi0.35Mo0.65O6-&#948; (SFN0.35M) simultaneously using as a fuel electrode and oxygen electrode in a reversible solid oxide cell (RSOC). SFN0.35M shows outstanding electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen oxidation, hydrogen evolution, oxygen reduction, and oxygen evolution. In situ exsolution and dissolution of Fe-Ni alloy nanoparticles in SFN0.35M is revealed. In a reducing atmosphere, SFN0.35M shows in situ exsolution of Fe-Ni alloy nanoparticles, and then the Fe-Ni alloy is reoxidized into SFN0.35M while converting into an oxidizing atmosphere. The polarization resistances of SFN0.35M electrode are 0.043 &#937; cm2 in 20% O2-N2 and 0.064 &#937; cm2 in H2 at 850 &#176;C. Moreover, symmetric fuel cells using the SFN0.35M electrode achieves a maximum power density of 0.501 W cm-2 at 850 &#176;C in H2 fuel, while the symmetric electrolysis cell has an electrolysis current density of 0.794 A cm-2 at 1.29 V in 90% H2O-10% H2 at 850 &#176;C. It is the first time we demonstrate that the cell voltage of symmetrical cell at 0.5 A cm-2 in the fuel cell mode and -0.5 A cm-2 in the electrolysis cell mode can be fully recovered in 10 electrode alternating cycles and therefore demonstrate the possibility that SFN0.35M can be used in a fully symmetric RSOC stack with electrode alternating functions.</description>

                Chlorine has been supplied by the chlor-alkali process that deploys dimensionally stable anodes (DSAs) for the electrochemical chlorine evolution reaction (ClER). The paramount bottlenecks have been ascribed to an intensive usage of precious elements and inevitable competition with the oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, a unique case of Ru2+-O4 active motifs anchored on Magn&#233;li Ti4O7 (Ru-Ti4O7) via a straightforward wet impregnation and mild annealing is reported. The Ru-Ti4O7 performs radically active ClER with minimal deployment of Ru (0.13 wt%), both in 5 m NaCl (pH 2.3) and 0.1 m NaCl (pH 6.5) electrolytes. Scanning electrochemical microscopy demonstrates superior ClER selectivity on Ru-Ti4O7 compared to the DSA. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal a universally active ClER (over a wide range of pH and [Cl-]), through a direct adsorption of Cl- on Ru2+-O4 sites as the most plausible pathway, together with stabilized ClO* at low [Cl-] and high pH.</description>

                Abstract For an efficient hydrogen production, electrochemical ethanol oxidation is a great alternative to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to the generation of value&#8208;added products. In this electrosynthetic contribution, the properties of ethanol oxidation are investigated with regard to the influence of pH, temperature and potential using RuO 2 &#8208;based catalysts. Results show acetic acid as main reaction product with yields of up to 29 % and Faraday efficiencies of &#8805;71 %. Increasing the potential marginally from 1.40 V vs. RHE to 1.45 V vs. RHE promoted parasitic OER and, therefore, yield (&#8805;10 %) and Faraday efficiency (&#8805;56 %) of the organic products decreased. Doping RuO 2 electrodes with TiO 2 shows promising results in suppressing OER during ethanol oxidation. Additionally, the catalyst allows moderate OER potentials in water electrolysis, making the catalyst a switchable material.</description>

                Abstract Over the past decades, tremendous effort has been made to enhance the water&#8208;splitting via fabricating eco&#8208;friendly electrocatalyst with increased conductivity, and large number of accessible active sites in lab scale. However, the development of earth abundant efficient electrocatalyst with superior activity for &#8208;seawater&#8208;splitting remains a great challenge for the researchers. In this regard, self&#8208;supported catalysts are found to be the most promising candidates, they have the features of increased loading, superior adhesion, rapid mass and charge transfer, and easy wettability for large scale hydrogen production via electrochemical seawater splitting. This review investigates different fabrication processes for the self&#8208;supported catalyst, emphasizing their distinct characteristics that contribute to improved activity. Furthermore, we provided a detailed elucidation of the procedure and characteristics of seawater splitting, emphasizing the most recent progress in the creation of self&#8208;supportive catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and bifunctional activity. We have also examined the current barriers and potential prospects for advancing the utilization of self&#8208;supported catalysts in the process of seawater splitting.</description>

                The design and development of efficient nanocatalysts are critical for sustainable hydrogen production via electrochemical water splitting. In this study, we synthesize mesoporous ruthenium film on Ni foam (mRu/NF) by micelle-assisted electrodeposition, followed by annealing in air to obtain mesoporous heterogeneous Ru-RuO2 film on NF (mRu/RuO2/NF) for alkaline water splitting. The mRu/RuO2/NF possesses low overpotentials for the oxygen evolution reaction (243 mV) and hydrogen reduction reaction (53 mV) at 50 mA cm&#8211;2 due to the high nanoporosity and heterogeneous interfaces. When mRu/RuO2/NF is applied to both the anode and cathode, the electrolyzer needs a lower potential of 1.587 V to drive the current density of 100 mA cm&#8211;2 than the commercial Pt/C/NF||IrO2/NF system (1.780 V). This study confirms the importance of interfacial engineering in the enhancement of water splitting.</description>

                Substrate surface modification with a functional material can effectively enhance the electrocatalytic performance of an electrode on oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, a functional Ni&#8208;BDC MOF nanosheet layer was in&#8208;situ grown on the surface of nickel foam (NF). Consequently, the NiFe layered double hydroxides (NiFe&#8208;LDH) electrodeposited on the modified layer exhibited an excellent activity and an amazing long&#8208;term stability on electrocatalytic OER. In alkaline electrolyte, the well&#8208;designed NiFe&#8208;LDH/Ni&#8208;BDC/NF drives a current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2 at a small overpotential of 223 mV, with a low Tafel slope of 33.1 mV dec&#8208;1 and an outstanding catalytic stability of more than 10 days under continuous electrocatalysis. Such distinguished performances are attributed to the particular hydrophily and electrical conductivity of the Ni&#8208;BDC layer. This work is an important attempt to bring a simple and effective guideline on fabricating a highly efficient catalytic electrode for OER.</description>

                Li-O2 batteries hold immense promise as high-performance of energy storage devices. Still, their practical application faces a significant hurdle in the form of elevated overpotentials, primarily attributed to the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and, notably, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at cathodes. The advent of photo-assisted Li-O2 batteries offers a promising solution by leveraging photocatalysts to accelerate the kinetics of ORR and OER. Among the photocatalysts available, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) becomes a focal point of interest owing to its exceptional properties and diverse applicability. This comprehensive review aims to explore g-C3N4-based photo-assisted Li-O2 batteries thoroughly. The coverage spans the structure and operational principles, a comprehensive survey of research advancements and notable exemplars, and an in-depth examination of design and enhancement strategies. The specific attributes of 2D g-C3N4 and fabrication of in-situ g-C3N4 photoelectrodes are emphasized. This review systematically delves into the current challenges faced by g-C3N4 application in photo-assisted Li-O2 batteries, while proposing possible solutions that lay foundation for the further advancement of this innovative energy storage technology.</description>

                Environmental degradation and energy constraint are important risks to long-term sustainability in the modern world. Water splitting is a vital approach for environmentally friendly and sustainable energy storage, providing a clean way to produce hydrogen without pollutants. Preparing a catalyst that is active, bifunctional, and durable for water splitting is a difficult task. We addressed the difficulty by creating a bifunctional heterogeneous catalyst, MoS2/rGO, with an ideal weight percentage of 5 wt% by a hydrothermal process. The optimized sample showed exceptional electrocatalytic activity, requiring an overpotential of 242 mV and 120 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER). Furthermore, our synthesized catalyst was validated for its exceptional water-splitting capacity, with the optimized sample showing low Tafel slope values of 59 mV dec-1 for HER and 171 mV dec-1 for OER. The significant OER and HER activity seen in the 5 wt% MoS2/rGO hybrid, compared to other hybrids, is due to the many catalytic active sites that aid in charge and electron transport, as well as the synergistic interaction between MoS2 and rGO.</description>

                Abstract In-depth comprehension and modulation of the electronic structure of the active metal sites is crucial to enhance their intrinsic activity of electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) toward anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). Here, we elaborate a series of amorphous metal oxide catalysts (FeCrO x , CoCrO x and NiCrO x ) with high performance AEMWEs by high-valent chromium dopant. We discover that the positive effect of the transition from low to high valence of the Co site on the adsorption energy of the intermediate and the lower oxidation barrier is the key factor for its increased activity by synchrotron radiation in-situ techniques. Particularly, the CoCrO x anode catalyst achieves the high current density of 1.5 A cm &#8722;2 at 2.1 V and maintains for over 120 h with attenuation less than 4.9 mV h &#8722;1 in AEMWE testing. Such exceptional performance demonstrates a promising prospect for industrial application and providing general guidelines for the design of high-efficiency AEMWEs systems.</description>

      <title>Low Power Consumption Ammonia Electrosynthesis Using Hydrogen-Nitrate Flow Electrolyzer</title>

                Ammonia synthesis through electrochemical nitrate reduction has emerged as a promising alternative to the conventional Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, the use of a sluggish oxygen evolution reaction as the anode reaction leads to high energy consumption in nitrate reduction. In this study, we directly utilize hydrogen gas to synthesize ammonia by pairing the hydrogen oxidation reaction with the nitrate reduction reaction. A significantly lower cell voltage for ammonia synthesis was realized on a 16 cm2 flow electrolyzer. We achieved an impressive ammonia yield rate of 16.9 mmol h&#8211;1 at a cell voltage of 1.2 V cell voltage. Notably, this approach exhibits a low power consumption of 17 kWh kg&#8211;1 of NH3. The mechanism study shows hydroxyl ions generated from water splitting at the cathode cross the anion exchange membrane to react with protons generated from hydrogen oxidation at the anode. Through rigorous technical and economic analyses, this approach is found to be economically viable for industrial synthesis.</description>

                Constructing and manipulating heterostructure is an effective strategy to prepare electrocatalysts with excellent performance for water electrolysis. Herein, an efficient alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts, Co3S4-embedded in carbon-encapsulated BaRuO3 (BaRuO3@CS-0.1), was synthesized through the sacrificial template method of ZIF-67 encapsulated BaRuO3 precursors. By inheriting the exceptional merits of different ingredients, this heterostructure catalyst BaRuO3@CS-0.1 enables intermetallic charge transfer between Ru and Co with boosted HER kinetics, and thus displaying higher catalytic activity towards HER, as evidenced by the intensively theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. BaRuO3@CS-0.1 exhibits excellent HER performance, with the lowered overpotentials of 26 mV to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in comparison to the pristine BaRuO3 (51 mV), which is also superior to Pt/C catalyst at large current density. Moreover, this heterostructure also demonstrates comparable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activities with the representative electrocatalysts, delivering current densities of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at a potential of 1.546 V for overall water splitting. These findings provide a rational route to optimize the performance of bulk electrocatalysts and endow them with richer electrochemical activity through this composite strategy.</description>

                Developing highly active, low-cost, and robust transition metal-based phosphide for alkaline overall water splitting is of utmost important to promote the practical application from fundamental. Herein, two-dimensional (2D) Mo-doped NiCoP nanoplates with novel amorphous/crystalline heterostructure (Mo(0.05)-NiCoP) in situ grown on three-dimensional nickel foam (NF) has been successfully constructed through hydrothermal reaction followed by the phosphorization treatment. Benefited from the synergy of amorphous/crystalline heterointerface, Mo doping, and unique 2D structure, the optimized Mo(0.05)-NiCoP exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving low overpotential of 67 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for HER and 233 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for OER. Meanwhile, there are only a cell voltage of 1.569 V was required to drive 10 mA cm&#8722;2 when Mo(0.05)-NiCoP used as both anode and cathode for overall water splitting. Thus, this study provides a novel approach to construct efficient 2D bifunctional catalysts with amorphous/crystalline heterostructure and heterogeneous metal doping.</description>

                Perovskites have attracted tremendous attention as potential catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It is well-known that the introduction of Fe into rare earth perovskites such as LaNiO3 enhances the intrinsic OER activity. Despite numerous studies on structure&#8211;property relationships, the origin of the activity and the nature of the active species are still elusive and unclear. In this work, we study a series of LaNixFe1&#8211;xO3 perovskites using in situ electrochemical surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy to decipher the surface evolution and formation of active species during OER. While the origin of the activity arises from NiOOH species formed from the active Ni centers in LaNiO3, our work shows that Fe serves as the active center in LaNi0.5Fe0.5O3 and forms Fe&#8211;O&#8211;Ni and FeOOH species during OER. The OER activity of LaFeO3 originates from FeOOH species, which interact with the soluble Ni species in the electrolyte forming an active electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface with high-valent stable surface iron species (Fe4+) and thereby improving the performance. Our work provides deeper insights into the synergistic effects of Ni and Fe on the catalytic activity, which in turn provides new design principles for perovskite catalysts for the OER.</description>

                Single-atom catalysts have garnered significant attention by showing sparkling performance in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the air cathode side of energy devices such as metal-air batteries and fuel cells. This work presents a novel catalyst, AC-CuFe-NC, that incorporates Fe-doped CuO atomic clusters (CuOFe) synergistically with single-atom sites. The AC-CuFe-NC demonstrates outstanding ORR performance (half-wave potential of 0.92 V) and an oxygen overpotential gap between ORR and OER as low as 0.61 V, which is among the top reported performances. Combined with in situ ATR-SEIRAS and DFT calculations, it is shown that the synergistic CuOFe atomic clusters are effective in inducing the electronic structure redistribution of the Fe single-atom site, modulating oxygen adsorption energy, and lowering ORR barriers. More importantly, it is revealed that the synergistic adsorption of clusters and single-atom sites establishes hydrogen bonds between the oxygenated intermediates and the electrolyte H2O molecules. The constructed hydrogen bond can provide a pathway for efficient proton transport as supported by kinetic isotope experiments, leading to a substantial enhancement in reaction kinetics. Additionally, the oxygenated intermediates are stabilized, and the Fe-O bond is elongated during the final step of ORR, thereby facilitating the desorption of OH*. The excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of AC-CuFe-NC enable it to show promising application in rechargeable Zn-air batteries. The innovative catalyst structure and synergistic mechanism demonstrated in this study shed light on the development of high-performance catalysts in energy devices.</description>

                Single-atom catalysts (SACs) are considered prominent materials in the field of catalysis due to their high metal atom utilization and selectivity. However, the wide-ranging applications of SACs remain a significant challenge due to their complex preparation processes. Here, we report a universal strategy to prepare a series of noble metal single atoms on different non-noble metal oxides through a facile one-step thermal decomposition of molten salts. By using a mixture of non-noble metal nitrate and a small-amount noble metal chloride as the precursor, noble metal single atoms can be easily introduced into the non-noble metal oxide lattice owing to the cation-exchange in the in-situ formed molten salt, followed by the thermal decomposition of nitrate anions during the heating process. Analyses using aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy confirm the formation of the finely dispersed single atoms. Specially, the as-synthesized Ir single atoms (10.97 wt%) and Pt single atoms (4.60 wt%) on the Co3O4 support demonstrate outstanding electrocatalytic activities for oxygen evolution reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction, respectively.

                Developing catalysts with high catalytic activity and stability in acidic media is crucial for advancing hydrogen production in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). To this end, a self-supported WO3@RuO2 nanowire structure was grown in situ on a titanium mesh using hydrothermal and ion-exchange methods. Despite a Ru loading of only 0.098 wt %, it achieves an overpotential of 246 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a current density of 10 mA&#183;cm-2 in acidic 0.5 M H2SO4 while maintaining excellent stability over 50 h, much better than that of the commercial RuO2. After the establishment of the WO3@RuO2 heterostructure, a reduced overpotential of the rate-determining step from M-O* to M-OOH* is confirmed by the DFT calculation. Meanwhile, its enhanced OER kinetics are also greatly improved by this self-supported system in the absence of the organic binder, leading to a reduced interface resistance between active sites and electrolytes. This work presents a promising approach to minimize the use of noble metals for large-scale PEMWE applications.</description>

                Renewable energy research emphasizes engineering highly active electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to scale up electrocatalytic water splitting. The factors that govern the intrinsic OER activity of an electrocatalyst such as morphology and active sites can be tuned through appropriate synthesis approach. Herein, we report ZnCo2O4 electrocatalyst synthesized by Solution combustion (ZCO-C), sol-gel (ZCO-SG) and hydrothermal method (ZCO-H) and the effect of different synthesis routes on OER activity is investigated. In 1 M KOH, ZCO-C exhibited excellent OER activity with a low overpotential and Tafel slope of 330 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 59.7 mV dec&#8722;1 respectively which is lower than reported literature on pristine ZnCo2O4. The superior OER activity of ZCO-C can be attributed to its higher crystallinity, enhanced electrochemical active surface area, higher active sites (Co3+/Co2+ ratio) and lower charge transfer resistance (Rct). The study highlights the crucial role of synthesis method in tuning the properties of the electrocatalysts towards OER.</description>

                Anion redox chemistry has emerged as a promising strategy for designing advanced cathode materials in lithium-ion batteries, especially for Li-rich Mn-based layered oxides (LRMOs). However, the associated oxygen evolution and irreversible structural rearrangements caused by oxygen redox lead to fatal degradation in performance, including voltage hysteresis, substantial irreversible capacity, and sluggish kinetics. Recently, pentavalent cation doping has been recognized as an effective approach to improving the reversible anion redox activities of layered oxides. However, most of the previous studies have predominantly emphasized the role of strong dopant-oxygen bonds in demonstrating the influence of pentavalent cation doping on LRMOs. Furthermore, most current reports lack a comprehensive understanding of the comparative effectiveness of pentavalent dopants. In this work, we have proposed novel aspects for the role of pentavalent cations in LRMO by comparatively investigating the effect of V5+, Sb5+, Ta5+, and Nb5+ doping on Li1.2Ni0.13Co0.13Mn0.54O2 from the crystallographic features and redox-behavior characteristics. In-depth crystallographic analyses by Rietveld refinement and synchrotron in situ X-ray diffraction were employed to provide insights into local structural properties, revealing oxygen sublattice distortion during electrochemical cycling with lithium ions. Furthermore, ex situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure and extended X-ray absorption fine structure were conducted to gain a more intuitive correlation between the transition-metal-redox behaviors and electrochemical properties, with a specific focus on the outstanding electrochemical properties, of V5+-doped LRMO. These findings suggest novel insights into the role of a high-valent dopant in oxygen redox chemistry, offering a guideline for modifying anion redox chemistry for high-energy cathode materials.</description>

                The development of an efficient and stable electrode remains an attractive challenge for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting to generate cheaper and green hydrogen (H2). Herein, we have fabricated a novel multicomponent molybdenum (Mo) doped bismuth vanadate/graphene (Mo-doped BiVO4@graphene) photoanode by simple spin coating technique followed by an annealing process. Precise control over Mo and graphene doping concentration (GR3/BVO:Mo-0.5) was attained, enabling excellent photocurrent density (4-fold increase as compared to BVO) with an enhanced rate of H2 production. This is attributed to the synergistic effect between molybdenum and graphene enhancing charge carrier density and suppressing the recombination rate of photo-generated electrons and holes. Our DFT studies indicate a reduction in the band gap value after doping pure BVO with Mo. In addition, we observed that the potential determining step of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the electrochemical adsorption of hydroxyl radical (H2O(l) + * &#8594; HO* + H+(aq) + e-), which is reduced by &#8764;0.8 eV after doping with Mo. This study reports on the unique design of a Mo-doped BiVO4@graphene hybrid electrode, which can be used as a superior electrode for green hydrogen generation under sunlight.</description>

      <title>A facile route for decoration of hematite photoanodes by transition metal hydroxide co&#8208;catalysts</title>

                Abstract Earth&#8208;abundant &#945;&#8208;Fe 2 O 3 (hematite) is a convincing photoanode for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting; however, its intrinsic properties of inferior charge transfer and sluggish water oxidation kinetics limit its performance. Here, we report a straightforward decoration method for transition metal hydroxides to accelerate the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of hematite photoanodes grown by electric field&#8208;assisted liquid phase deposition (EA&#8208;LPD). The investigations revealed that Co(OH) 2 acts as a superior co&#8208;catalyst compared with hydroxides of Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Zn. EA&#8208;LPD&#8208;grown hematite photoanode loaded with cobalt hydroxide exhibited an excellent PEC performance. A photocurrent density of 0.93 mA.cm &#8722;2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode was achieved for the modified hematite, &#8764;3 times more than that of pristine hematite, and a cathodic shift of 100 mV for the onset potential was observed. The proposed simple and cost&#8208;effective co&#8208;catalyst loading strategy provides a high degree of freedom in the design of co&#8208;catalysts with a complex chemical composition comprising transition metal oxyhydroxides and hydroxides on different photoanodes for more efficient charge carrier separation for the PEC applications.</description>

      <title>Cobalt corroles: Synthesis and applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccr.2024.215869</link>
      <description>Jyoti, Jiajia An, D. Y. Kim, David G. Churchill, Anil Kumar, Coordination chemistry reviews. 511(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394946656

                Cobalt corrole chemistry has become its own corpus of corrole literature in recent years, with findings involving synthesis, catalysis, sensing, electrocatalysis, etc reported with increasing frequency. Cobalt is abundant and biologically essential (e.g., cobalamin). Since Co metallocorroles are relatively straightforward to synthesize, this makes Co corroles already a practical and sustainable macrocycle class suitable for further research and "post functionalization." In addition, the metal is redox active and (therefore) vastly catalytically active. The versatility of redox active cobalt as a central atom in corroles helps achieve oxidation states ranging from Co1+ to Co5+; this has allowed researchers to synthesize, and therefore experimentally access, the chemistry of a large number of cobalt metallocorroles that have been substituted with various groups at the &#946;&#8211;, meso&#8211;, or axial&#8211; positions. From these published examples, a wide array of structural properties and characteristics continue to unfold; a review is now due to help focus the researchers concentrating on this area to enable for outstanding future investigations. Their stabilization into different oxidation states has also made Co corroles valuable and heavily pursued in electrocatalysis. These complexes are frequently used for oxygen and reduction reactions, hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs), and oxygen evolution reactions (OERs). Co&#8211;corroles have thus widespread usage beyond catalysis per se, including sensing of anions and various gas molecules and, in some cases, small molecule activation. When N2 and O2 are present, Co complexes may preferentially bind and detect CO. This current review helps (i) summarize the accomplishments to date in synthesis and characterization, (ii) consolidate all the key characteristics of cobalt corroles within a common area of access, and (iii) expand our understanding of how these "active" macrocycles might be used across different scientific and technological disciplines (see future work section).</description>

      <title>Fe-Doped CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Nanocages as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsanm.4c01449</link>

                Currently, electrochemical water-splitting activity is limited by the slow intrinsic reaction kinetics and energy conversion efficiency, so designing highly efficient electrocatalysts that can facilitate electrochemical reactions remains necessary. Herein, the catalyst architecture consisting of Fe-doped CoS2 nanocages with nitrogen-doped carbon wrapping (CN/Fe-CoS2) was explored as an outstanding bifunctional electrocatalyst. Through density functional theory calculations, the introduction of Fe into CoS2 would modulate the density of states, making the reduced band gap and enhanced intrinsic charge transfer efficiency of CoS2. Simultaneously, the adsorption of intermediates during the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) processes is regulated, leading to an improvement in the intrinsic catalytic activity. The experimental results demonstrate that Fe doping significantly enhances the electron transfer, specific surface area, and electrochemical active area of CoS2, which facilitates the efficient utilization of charge and exposes additional active sites for electrochemical reactions. In addition, the nanocage architecture and nitrogen-doped carbon wrapping in CN/Fe-CoS2 act as a protective layer to prevent CoS2 aggregation, thereby exposing additional active sites and enhancing the interface with the electrolyte. By optimizing the amount of Fe, CN/Fe-CoS2 demonstrates a remarkably superior electrocatalytic performance and stability, as evidenced by the low overpotential (&#951;10) of 186 and 304 mV at the current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 in 1.0 M KOH media for HER and OER, respectively. Overall, combining heteroatom doping and structure designing represents a promising approach to develop high-performance electrocatalysts for water splitting.</description>

                Abstract Conductive &#960;&#8208;d conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted wide concerns in electrocatalysis due to their intrinsic high conductivity. However, the poor electrocatalytic stability is still a major problem that hinders the practical application of MOFs. Herein, we report a novel approach to enhancing the stability of MOF&#8208;based electrocatalyst, namely, the introduction of hydrogen bonds (H&#8208;bonds). Impressively, the &#960;&#8208;d conjugated MOF FeCo 3 (DDA) 2 exhibits ultra&#8208;high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) stability (up to 2000 h). The experimental studies demonstrate that the presence of H&#8208;bonds in FeCo 3 (DDA) 2 is responsible for its ultra&#8208;high OER stability. Besides that, FeCo 3 (DDA) 2 also displays a prominent OER activity (an overpotential of 260 mV versus RHE at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 46.86 mV dec &#8722;1 ). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further indicate that the synergistic effect of the Fe and Co sites in FeCo 3 (DDA) 2 contributes to its prominent OER performance. This work provides a new avenue of boosting the electrocatalytic stability of conductive &#960;&#8208;d conjugated MOFs. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved</description>

      <title>Efficient Alkaline Water Oxidation Electrocatalysis Enabled via the Modulation of Sn&#8208;containing Anions towards NiFe Oxyhydroxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202400343</link>

                Despite being considered as efficient non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), NiFe (oxy)hydroxides (NiFeOxHy) typically fall short of meeting practical requirements. To address this challenge, herein, we introduce a facile in situ electrochemical incorporation technique to form Sn&#8208;doped NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (NiFeSn&#8208;LDH) precatalysts. Subsequently, under the alkaline OER process, the precatalyst evolves into stannate ion&#8208;adsorbed NiFe oxyhydroxides (NiFeOOH). The presence of these stable stannate oxyanions plays a key role in mitigating Fe leaching, optimizing the electronic structure of NiFeOOH, and improving its reaction kinetics, thereby significantly enhancing alkaline OER performance. Notably, the nickel foam&#8208;supported NiFeSn&#8208;LDH demonstrated impressive results delivering a large current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 at an overpotential as low as ~260 mV and maintaining the industrial&#8208;relevant ~500 mA cm&#8722;2 current density over 5 days with negligible activity decay, surpassing the performance of most of the transition metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts. Comprehensive advanced characterization of the precatalysts, before and after the OER reactions, has been performed to uncover stable residual stannate ions at the surface of NiFeOxHy and to determine their pivotal role in promoting alkaline OER.</description>

                The electrochemical coupling of biomass oxidation and nitrogen conversion presents a potential strategy for high value&#8208;added chemicals and nitrogen cycling. Herein, in this work, CuO/Co 3 O 4 with heterogeneous interface is successfully constructed as a bifunctional catalyst for the electrooxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid and the electroreduction of nitrate to ammonia (NH 3 ). The open&#8208;circuit potential spontaneous experiment shows that more 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural molecules are adsorbed in the Helmholtz layer of the CuO/Co 3 O 4 composite, which certifies that the CuO/Co 3 O 4 heterostructure is conducive to the kinetic adsorption of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural. In situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further shows that CuO/Co 3 O 4 has faster reaction kinetics and lower reaction potential in oxygen evolution reaction and 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural electrocatalytic oxidation. Moreover, CuO/Co 3 O 4 also has a good reduction effect on . The ex&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy shows that under the reduction potential, the metal oxide is reduced, and the generated Cu 2 O can be used as a new active site for the reaction to promote the electrocatalytic conversion of to NH 3 synthesis. This work provides valuable guidance for the synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals by 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural electrocatalytic oxidation coupled with while efficiently producing NH 3 .</description>

                Abstract Alkaline anion&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) for green hydrogen production have received intensive attention due to their feasibility of using earth&#8208;abundant platinum group metal (PGM)&#8208;free catalysts. Herein, the third metal is incorporated into NiFe&#8208;based catalysts to regulate their electronic structures and morphologies, aiming to achieve sufficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and performance in AEMWEs. The ternary NiFeM (M: Cu, Co, or Mn) catalysts are featured with multiple layered structures and nanofoam network morphologies, consisting of highly OER&#8208;active amorphous Ni&#8208;rich oxide shells and electrically conductive metallic alloy cores. The physical and electronic perturbations to the NiFe induced by a third element lead to a fine&#8208;tuning of the redox ability of the metal sites at the reaction centers, which breaks the scaling relationship between OH* and O* intermediates at the reaction centers. Thus, the unique structural configuration and electronic regulation simultaneously benefit catalytic activity and performance improvements. These NiFeM nanofoam catalysts demonstrated promising anode performance in actual AEMWEs, comparable to the IrO 2 reference, especially at high current densities. Notably, using various electrolytes (e.g., KOH solution or pure water) for AEMWEs exhibited a different performance trend among studied NiFeM catalysts, likely due to dynamic changes of catalysts under various OER environments.</description>

                Abstract The proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE), crucial for green hydrogen production, is challenged by the scarcity and high cost of iridium&#8208;based materials. Cobalt oxides, as ideal electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), have not been extensively applied in PEMWE, due to extremely high voltage and poor stability at large current density, caused by complicated structural variations of cobalt compounds during the OER process. Thus, the authors sought to introduce chromium into a cobalt spinel (Co 3 O 4 ) catalyst to regulate the electronic structure of cobalt, exhibiting a higher oxidation state and increased Co&#8211;O covalency with a stable structure. In&#8208;depth operando characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that the activated Co&#8211;O covalency and adaptable redox behavior are crucial for facilitating its OER activity. Both turnover frequency and mass activity of Cr&#8208;doped Co 3 O 4 (CoCr) at 1.67 V (vs RHE) increased by over eight times than those of as&#8208;synthesized Co 3 O 4 . The obtained CoCr catalyst achieved 1500 mA cm &#8722;2 at 2.17 V and exhibited notable durability over extended operation periods &#8211; over 100 h at 500 mA cm &#8722;2 and 500 h at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 , demonstrating promising application in the PEMWE industry.</description>

      <title>Substantial Impact of Spin State Evolution in OER/ORR Catalyzed by Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c06122</link>

                The Fe-embedded N-doped graphene (Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C) is the most representative single atom catalyst (SAC) that has shown great potentiality in electrocatalysis, such as oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the active moiety of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C is still elusive due to contradictory experimental results. Moreover, early simulations mainly focus on the thermodynamic potential of adsorbates, while the effect of spin multiplicity receives little attention. To explore the role of spin multiplicity in electrocatalysis, we employ the constant-potential density functional theory (DFT) to systematically study the structural evolution of the high-spin (HS) and intermediate-spin (IS) FeN4 site (marked by FeN4HS/IS) in OER and ORR processes. With the consideration of spin multiplicity, our simulation shows spontaneous oxidation from Fe(II)N4IS to Fe(III)N4HS at potential U = 0.4 V versus SHE. Further simulation indicates that the FeN4IS site undergoes a sequential adsorption of *OH and *OOH along with U increase, which leads to the spin state transition from IS to HS. According to the constant-potential free energy analysis, the FeN4HS*OOH is confirmed to be the practical active centers of OER, while the FeN4HS*OH and FeN4IS are assigned to the active center of ORR in low and high overpotentials. The predicted ORR activity of FeN4HS*OH agrees with the in situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) and 57Fe M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy measurement by Xiao et al. [Microporous Framework Induced Synthesis of Single-Atom Dispersed Fe-NC Acidic ORR Catalyst and its In Situ Reduced Fe-N4 Active Site Identification Revealed by X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy. ACS Catal. 2018, 8, 2824&#8211;2832]. Based on the geometry and orbital analysis, the bond length of Fe&#8211;N and coordination number of Fe center are found to have a significant impact on the d orbital splitting energy and thus induce the turnover of HS/IS stability in the OER/ORR intermediates. Our study brings comprehensive insights into the evolution of coordination and spin state in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C, which reveals the significance of spin multiplicity in electrocatalysis and benefits further theoretical design of SACs from the perspective of spin effects.</description>

      <title>Understanding Anomalous Gas-Phase Peak Shifts in Dip-and-Pull Ambient Pressure XPS Experiments</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c00113</link>
      <description>Detre Teschner, Julius Plescher, Simone Piccinin, Travis E. Jones, Adnan Hammud, Franz Schmidt, Axel Knop&#8208;Gericke, Hendrik Bluhm, Andrey Shavorskiy, Journal of physical chemistry. C./Journal of physical chemistry. C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4395004526

                Dip-and-pull ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) holds promise to uncover elementary processes of (photo)electrochemistry. We show, however, that the sample for such experiments should preferably be nonporous and the potential on the surface homogeneous. We carried out dip-and-pull AP-XPS experiments on a hematite thin film sample under the photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and find unexpected O 1s core level shifts. Upon electrochemical biasing under simulated solar light illumination, the gas-phase water peak shifted more than the electrolyte peak. To uncover the origin of the unexpected larger shift of the gas-phase peak, we performed electrostatic simulations using COMSOL, to map the potential field in the relevant volume between the sample and the first aperture of the XPS spectrometer. A number of geometric models were considered. We find that when the potential on the sample surface is inhomogeneous, e.g., with ionically isolated electrolyte patches, the gas-phase peak of the spectrum can shift more than the peak due to the electrolyte film. This suggests that at the measured sample position, the local potential was not as set by the potentiostat. Despite this, we find reversible consumption and replenishment of hydroxide in the spectra, which, due to OH&#8211; being the reactant of the OER in alkaline electrolyte, makes sense chemically. We propose that this is linked to OH&#8211; diffusion across the measured sample position, driven by the potential dependent consumption and replenishment of OH&#8211; at the nearby well-connected surface regions.</description>

                Summary Synergistic effects are often used for interpreting the enhanced electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity of catalysts with two or more elements. However, the mechanism behind this synergy remains ambiguous. Here, we report an Fe-doped Ni2Mo3O8 (Ni2&#8722;xFexMo3O8, where x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0) series with high OER activity (only 196 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for x = 0.5) and high stability over 200 h at a high current density of 500 mA cm&#8722;2. Our in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopies indicated a valence-state transition from Fe2+/Ni2+ to Fe3+(Fe4+)/Ni3+ and a structural transition from corner-sharing Fe(Ni)&#8211;O&#8211;Fe(Ni) to an edge-sharing network. The highest catalytic activity of Ni1.5Fe0.5Mo3O8 among this series is interpreted as a gain in the exchange energy (ca. 1 eV) of the Fe4+/Ni3+ pair facilitated by intersite hopping owing to its highest Fe valence state. Our results reveal a previously unreported mechanism for the Ni-Fe synergistic effect that enhances OER activity.</description>

                Abstract The design of bifunctional electrocatalysts toward reduction reaction of carbon dioxide (ECO 2 RR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in aqueous rechargeable Zn&#9472;CO 2 batteries (ZABs) still poses a significant challenge. Herein, Ni clusters (Ni x ) of 0.5 and 0.8 nm in diameter coupled with single Ni site (Ni&#8722;N 4 &#8722;C), denoted as Ni&#8722;N 4 /Ni 5 and Ni&#8722;N 4 /Ni 8 , respectively, are synthesized and the size effect of Ni nanoclusters are studied. Ni&#8722;N 4 /Ni 5 exhibits an &#8776;100% Faradaic efficiency ( FE CO ) toward ECO 2 RR for CO from &#8722;0.4 to &#8722;0.8 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, superior to that of Ni&#8722;N 4 &#8722;C ( FE CO = 55.0%) and Ni&#8722;N 4 /Ni 8 ( FE CO = 80.0%). The OER performance of Ni&#8722;N 4 /Ni 5 and Ni&#8722;N 4 /Ni 8 are superior or comparable to that of commercial RuO 2 but outperform that of Ni&#8722;N 4 &#8722;C. Theoretical calculation indicates that * COOH of ECO 2 RR intermediates bond synergistically with Ni x clusters and Ni&#8722;N 4 &#8722;C single atom site, promoting the activation of CO 2 and reducing the energy barrier of the potential determining step of ECO 2 RR. Such effect is strongly size&#8208;dependent and larger Ni x nanoclusters result in too strong binding of * COOH intermediates, impede the formation of * CO. As a bifunctional cathode electrocatalyst of rechargeable alkaline aqueous ZABs, Ni&#8722;N 4 /Ni 5 exhibits a peak power density of 11.7 mW cm &#8722;2 and cycling durability over 1200 cycles and 420 h.</description>

      <title>Mixed-halide vacancy-ordered double perovskite for photovoltaic and photocatalysis applications</title>

      <description>Sanika S. Padelkar, . Vikram, Jacek J. Jasieniak, Alexandr N. Simonov, Aftab Alam, Physical review applied. 21(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394876247

                Here, we report detailed first-principles calculations of the structural stability, optoelectronic properties, and interaction with water for a wide range of mixed-halide compositions of vacancy-ordered double perovskites ${\mathrm{Cs}}_{2}{\mathrm{Pt}(\mathrm{Cl}}_{x}{\mathrm{I}}_{1\ensuremath{-}x}{)}_{6}$. Our calculations reveal that lower halide dopant levels subdue phase segregation and enhance the stability. ${\mathrm{Cs}}_{2}{\mathrm{Pt}(\mathrm{Cl}}_{x}{\mathrm{I}}_{1\ensuremath{-}x}{)}_{6}$ demonstrate improved defect tolerance as compared to ${\mathrm{Cs}}_{2}{\mathrm{Pt}\mathrm{I}}_{6}$ due to the covalent nature of the Pt---X bond. The chloride-rich ${\mathrm{Cs}}_{2}\mathrm{Pt}$(${\mathrm{Cl}}_{x}{\mathrm{I}}_{1\ensuremath{-}x}$)${}_{6}$ exhibit notably improved stability against reaction with water, far surpassing ${\mathrm{Cs}}_{2}{\mathrm{Pt}\mathrm{I}}_{6}$ due to the enhanced Cs---Cl bond strength and lower charge transfer between adsorbed ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}\mathrm{O}$ and surface Cs atoms. The spectroscopic limited maximum photovoltaic efficiency for the optimal composition of ${\mathrm{Cs}}_{2}\mathrm{Pt}$(${\mathrm{Cl}}_{0.04}{\mathrm{I}}_{0.96}$)${}_{6}$ under 1 sun AM1.5G is determined to be $24$% for a 5-$\text{\ensuremath{\mu}}\mathrm{m}$-thick film. Our calculations also suggest that the valence-band edge of this material might be positioned more positive than the standard potential of the oxygen-evolution reaction. These two factors combined with the high stability against reaction with water indicate that ${\mathrm{Cs}}_{2}\mathrm{Pt}$(${\mathrm{Cl}}_{0.04}{\mathrm{I}}_{0.96}$)${}_{6}$ might be of considerable interest as a photovoltaic absorber, and possibly as a component of anodes for the photoelectrocatalytic water oxidation. Meanwhile, ${\mathrm{Cs}}_{2}\mathrm{Pt}$(${\mathrm{Cl}}_{0.96}{\mathrm{I}}_{0.04}$)${}_{6}$ traverses relevant reduction and oxidation redox potentials, affirming it as a promising candidate for the overall photo(electro)catalyst water-splitting reaction.</description>

      <title>Exploring the potential of Decade-Air exposed perovskite membranes through sustainable recycling approaches</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.151406</link>
      <description>Di Wu, Chao Shen, Weibin Zhou, Jinkun Tan, Yongqiang Niu, Zhengkun Liu, Guangru Zhang, Wanqin Jin, Chemical engineering journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394876120

                The stability of perovskite-based oxygen permeable membranes under long-term storage conditions, especially in the presence of water and carbon dioxide, presents a significant challenge. In this study, we examined the impact of extended storage (more than 10 years) on Nb2O5-doped SrCo0.8Fe0.2O3-&#948; (10Yr-SCFN) membranes. To unlock their industrial application potential, various approaches involving a combination of physical and chemical treatments to restore membrane properties in aged membranes are proposed and validated, while systematically investigating the evolution in chemical composition, microstructure, mechanical strength, and oxygen permeability. The 10Yr-SCFN membranes can be effectively restored through the secondary sintering method, wherein the membrane is first powdered and then calcinated in static air to maximize the removal of impurities. The mechanical strength and oxygen permeability reach levels of 30 MPa and 1.2 ml cm&#8722;2 min&#8722;1 (900 &#176;C), respectively, comparable to the performance of freshly prepared membranes. These findings shed some light on the potentiality of sustainable recycling of perovskite membranes and provide theoretical and technical support for the practical application and industrialization of oxygen permeable membranes.</description>

      <title>Effect of the operating temperature on the degradation of solid oxide electrolysis cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234541</link>
      <description>Giuseppe Sassone, &#1254;zden &#199;elikbilek, Maxime Hubert, Katherine Develos-Bagarinao, Thomas David, Laure Gu&#233;taz, Isabelle Martin, Julie Villanova, Anass Benayad, L&#233;a Rorato, Julien Vulliet, Bertrand Morel, Aline L&#233;on, J&#233;r&#244;me Laurencin, Journal of power sources. 605(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394903662

                The present work aims to better understand the effect of operating temperature on the degradation of Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOECs). The studied SOECs consist of La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3-&#948;-Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-&#948; (LSCF-GDC) oxygen electrode, GDC diffusion barrier layer, Y0.16Zr0.84O1.92 (YSZ) electrolyte and Ni-YSZ hydrogen electrode. Durability tests are carried out at 750, 800 and 850 &#176;C for 2000 h at &#8722;1 A cm&#8722;2, using 10/90 vol% H2/H2O and dry air at the hydrogen and oxygen electrodes, respectively. The electrochemical impedance spectra measured before and after ageing reveal a strong evolution related to the hydrogen electrode, while the change in the oxygen electrode contribution remains negligible. A set of advanced characterization techniques are employed to study the cell degradation. For the hydrogen electrode, a large Ni depletion is observed after ageing, which increases with the operating temperature. The analysis of the oxygen electrode shows an elemental inter-diffusion between the LSCF-GDC/GDC/YSZ layers on the manufactured cells that seems to not evolve significantly upon operation. Moreover, the presence of SrZrO3 is not detected in the pristine cell and in the operated ones. Besides, only a limited LSCF decomposition is found in good agreement with the electrochemical characterizations. Hypotheses that could explain the good oxygen electrode stability are discussed.</description>

      <title>An environmental corrected descriptor based on &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;orbital spin states for atomically dispersed dual&#8208;metal catalysts</title>

                Abstract Atomically dispersed dual&#8208;metal sites catalysts, also named as dual&#8208;atom catalysts, have become a frontier, since they combine the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts to satisfy the demands for critical catalytic reactions in green energy industrial equipment. However, the absence of further understanding for the evolution of catalyst structures in reaction environments results in a significant gap between the theoretical and experimental. Here, we provide a model to understand the evolution of the active configuration in acidic oxygen reduction and evolution reactions and propose an environmental corrected descriptor (&#916;&#958;) based on d &#8208;orbital spin states to reveal the activity control mechanism. Taking the acidic ORR as an example, &#916;&#958; correlated well with the overpotential ( R 2 = 0.96), which is determined by the number of electron occupancies in d z 2 orbital ( F dz 2 ). Accordingly, this work provides new insights into the design of green energy industrial catalysts in reaction environments.</description>

      <title>Ablation mechanism of C/C&#8211;SiC composites in supersonic oxygen&#8208;enriched ablation environment for the internal flow field</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/ijac.14761</link>
      <description>Gao Yong, Jin&#8208;Jin Wang, Bailin Zha, Zhensheng Sun, Lingling Wang, Ruifeng Li, International journal of applied ceramic technology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394882325

                Abstract This study investigates the ablation resistance of C/C&#8211;SiC composites using the ground simulation internal flow&#8208;field supersonic oxygen&#8208;rich ablation test technology. The microstructure evolution and ablation mechanism of the composites in a supersonic oxygen&#8208;rich environment were explored by examining the macroscopic and microscopic ablation morphologies of the composites before and after the test. The results demonstrate that C/C&#8211;SiC composites exhibit excellent ablation resistance, with mass and linear ablation rates of .46 &#215; 10 &#8722;2 g/s and .42 &#215; 10 &#8722;2 mm/s, respectively, after 120 s of ablation in a low gas temperature and high oxygen&#8208;rich ablation thermal environment. As the gas temperature increases, the mass and linear ablation rates of C/C&#8211;SiC composites gradually increase, even though the oxygen enrichment within the gas components decreases. When the gas temperature reaches 2178&#8211;2491 K, the mass and linear ablation rates increase to 1.31 &#215; 10 &#8722;2 g/s and .84 &#215; 10 &#8722;2 mm/s, respectively. Furthermore, at high temperatures above 2650 K, the mass and linear ablation rates of the composites exhibit a geometric multiple increase, reaching 4.73 &#215; 10 &#8722;2 g/s and 1.89 &#215; 10 &#8722;2 mm/s, respectively. These findings indicate that the ablation resistance of C/C&#8211;SiC composites in the supersonic oxygen&#8208;rich ablation environment is more sensitive to gas temperature than oxygen enrichment. The main factors contributing to the increased ablation rate of C/C&#8211;SiC composites in the supersonic oxygen&#8208;rich ablation process include the formation of a glass SiO 2 oxide film, transition to molten SiO 2 , erosion of molten SiO 2 , and high&#8208;temperature sublimation of the SiC matrix.</description>

                Milar Tuberculosis (TB) is a presentation with a fatal outcome if it is not diagnosed or treated on time; although certain conditions are required to develop this presentation. In this In this article, the case of a 48-year-old man with no pathological history is studied, who started the disease with a time of six months with an initial diffuse gastrointestinal pain and later one month before admission presented progressive respiratory symptoms; he was admitted for emergencies where bilateral diffuse miliary compromise was evident in the chest computed tomography; upon admission, he was administered oxygen and support measures, an HIV test was obtained which was negative, and positive results were obtained in the sputum smear microscopy. His clinical evolution was stationary until the administration of antituberculosis therapy, observing slight clinical improvement, likewise, low doses of corticosteroids were administered after which a favorable evolution was demonstrated and he was discharged.</description>

                Abstract Electrocatalysts with high activity towards both oxygen reduction and evolution reaction are desirable for metal-air batteries. However, most commercially used electrocatalysts result in sluggish kinetics for these oxygen reactions, and different catalysts are usually used for each oxygen reaction. The development of efficient electrocatalysts that can facilitate both reactions, with low overpotentials resulting in less energy consumption is desirable. Herein we report secondary data analysis for materials developed in our previous study, FeS2 electrocatalyst supported on chlorinated carbon nanotubes (ClCNTs) using chemicals that are not harsh chemicals and investigated its catalytic activity towards ORR and OER. FeS2 nanoparticles were produced by thermal annealing of ClCNTs in thiophene at different annealing temperatures. The effect of thiophene volume and reaction time on the growth of FeS2 nanoparticles was also evaluated. The size of FeS2 nanoparticles coated on the surface of ClCNTs increased with an increase in thermal annealing reaction time, and this reduced the catalytic activity of the materials. Whereas as the volume of thiophene was increased during the production of FeS2-loaded ClCNTs, no FeS2 nanoparticles were observed on the surface of the ClCNTs. ClCNTs annealed at 900 &#176;C showed the greatest growth of FeS2 nanoparticles on their surface and provided the greatest enhancement of the ORR and OER activities, evidenced by the low Tafel slope of 63 mV/dec and low overpotential of 252 mV. The number of electrons involved during the reduction of oxygen was found to be 4, which means that the formation of water was favorable when using this electrocatalyst. In our previous study only, cyclic voltammetry was used to evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the materials toward ORR.</description>

                Nanostructured composite films with 0.8ZnO &#8211; 0.2BaTiO3/Al2O3 (ZB2) composition were irradiated using 200 MeV Ag+15 ions with 5 &#215; 1010 ions/cm2 to 5 &#215; 1012 ions/cm2 fluences to understand the variation in anti-ferroelectric (AFE) property and hysteric I-V behavior. XRD data of all the pristine and irradiated films show the presence of compressive strain and dominance of ZnO phase. AFM reveals the evolution of unevenly spaced pattern separated by brink like structure and the space between brinks increase with ion fluence. RBS measurement confirms film thickness and elemental composition of pristine and irradiated ZB2 films. Irradiation induced modifications in unconventional double hysteresis loop in ferroelectric (P-E) measurements is discussed in the light of formation of structural defect and oxygen vacancies and its role in domain wall motion. Variations in the resistive switching in I-V hysteresis behavior was understood in the context of oxygen vacancies and defect formation by ion irradiation.</description>

                Abstract The currently ongoing scale-up of high-temperature solid oxide electrolysis (SOEL) requires an understanding of the underlying dominant degradation mechanisms to enable continuous progress in increasing stack durability. In the present study, the degradation behavior of SOEL stacks of the type &#8216;MK35x&#8217; with chromium-iron-yttrium (CFY) interconnects and electrolyte-supported cells (ESC) developed at Fraunhofer IKTS was investigated. For this purpose, the initial electrochemical performance of a 10-cell stack was characterized in various operating conditions in both fuel cell and electrolysis mode. Degradation was evaluated during galvanostatic steady-state steam electrolysis operation for more than 3000 h at an oxygen side outlet temperature of 816&#176;C and a current density of -0.6 A cm-2 and showed an average voltage evolution rate of -0.3 %/kh demonstrating high stability. Initial and final characterization at the part load operating point at -0.39 A cm-2 and 800&#176;C led to the determination of a positive overall degradation rate of 0.4 %/kh showing a considerable impact of the operating conditions on the degradation rate. By means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis it was shown that the stack&#8217;s ohmic resistance increased whereas the polarization resistance decreased most likely due to an enhancement in LSMM&#8217;/ScSZ oxygen electrode performance.</description>

                Time-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (TR-XPS) is used in a simulation study to monitor the excited state intramolecular proton transfer between oxygen and nitrogen atoms in 2-(iminomethyl)phenol. Real-time monitoring of the chemical bond breaking and forming processes is obtained through the time evolution of excited-state chemical shifts. By employing individual atomic probes of the proton donor and acceptor atoms, we predict distinct signals with opposite chemical shifts of the donor and acceptor groups during proton transfer. Details of the ultrafast bond breaking and forming dynamics are revealed by extending the classical electron spectroscopy chemical analysis to real time. Through a comparison with simulated time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy at the valence level, the distinct advantage of TR-XPS is demonstrated thanks to its atom specificity.</description>

                An engineering system approach of 2-D cylindrical model of transient mass balance calculations of ozone and other concerned chemicals along with fourteen photolysis, ozone-generating and ozone-depleting chemical reaction equations was developed, validated, and used for studying the ozone concentrations, distribution and peak of the layer, ozone depletion and total ozone abundance in the stratosphere. The calculated ozone concentrations and profile at both the Equator and a 60&#730;N location were found to follow closely with the measured data. The calculated average ozone concentration was within 1% of the measured average, and the deviation of ozone profiles was within 14%. The monthly evolution of stratospheric ozone concentrations and distribution above the Equator was studied with results discussed in details. The influences of slow air movement in both altitudinal and radial directions on ozone concentrations and profile in the stratosphere were explored and discussed. Parametric studies of the influences of gas diffusivities of ozone DO3 and active atomic oxygen DO on ozone concentrations and distributions were also studied and delineated. Having both influences through physical diffusion and chemical reactions, the diffusivity (and diffusion) of atomic oxygen DO was found to be more sensitive and important than that of ozone DO3 on ozone concentrations and distribution. The 2-D ozone model present in this paper for stratospheric ozone and its layer and depletion is shown to be robust, convenient, efficient, and executable for analyzing the complex ozone phenomena in the stratosphere.</description>

      <title>Light-induced photoluminescence enhancement in chiral CdSe quantum dot films</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0201365</link>
      <description>Y. Wang, Pan Liang, Yumeng Men, Meizhen Jiang, Lin Cheng, J Li, Tianqing Jia, Zhenrong Sun, Donghai Feng, Donghai Feng, Journal of chemical physics online/&#152;The &#156;Journal of chemical physics/Journal of chemical physics. 160(16)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4395039005

                Chiral quantum dots (QDs) are promising materials applied in many areas, such as chiral molecular recognition and spin selective filter for charge transport, and can be prepared by facile ligand exchange approaches. However, ligand exchange leads to an increase in surface defects and reduces the efficiencies of radiative recombination and charge transport, which restricts further applications. Here, we investigate the light-induced photoluminescence (PL) enhancement in chiral L- and D-cysteine CdSe QD thin films, providing a strategy to increase the PL. The PL intensity of chiral CdSe QD films can be significantly enhanced over 100 times by continuous UV laser irradiation, indicating a strong passivation of surface defects upon laser irradiation. From the comparative measurements of the PL intensity evolutions in vacuum, dry oxygen, air, and humid nitrogen atmospheres, we conclude that the mechanism of PL enhancement is photo-induced surface passivation with the assistance of water molecules.</description>

      <title>CONSERVATION AND VARIABILITY OF THE ANTIOXIDANT PROTECTION SYSTEM OF THE RETINAL PIGMENT EPITHELIA IN VERTEBRATES</title>

                In the course of evolution and adaptation to life conditions, organisms have developed the strategies that allow to use of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in regulation of physiological processes and in maintenance of homeostasis. Retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is one of the prime examples of tissues with a high level of metabolism and intracellular ROS, that have the more risk of damage after oxidative stress (OS), under the influence of exogenous or endogenous stress factors. Vertebrate RPE cells, despite the conservatism of the eye tissue structures and their main functions, respond differently to OS are due to the ta&#1093;on-species specificity of the components of signaling pathways that form the antioxidant defense system (AODS). Transcription factors, in particular, Nrf2 play a key role in AODS. AODS in RPE includes the several levels of regulation, interaction of which ensures the stability of morphofunctional state of the cells. Phylogenetic analysis of the key components of AODS in various vertebrates revealed not only conservation, but also variability in the protein domain organization. This may reflect the differences in functions, adaptability and regenerative potential. The identification of AODS mechanisms that ensure the morphofunctional stability of RPE cells is of fundamental importance and is aimed at finding tissue-specific targets for effective treatment of a spectrum of eye diseases.</description>

      <title>Magnesian Basalts of the Medvezhia Caldera: Main Magmas and Their Sources on the Example of the Menshiy Brat Volcano (Iturup Island)</title>

                The paper represents new data on the formation conditions of basalts from post-caldera volcano Menshiy Brat (Medvezhia caldera, Iturup Island). Liquidus mineral assemblage is composed of olivine (Fo up to 90.1 mol. %) and chromium spinel (Cr# = 0.46&#8211;0.6), which crystallized at 1090&#8211;1170&#176;&#1057; and oxygen fugacity NNO +0.6 (&#963; = 0.2) &#8211; NNO +0.2 (&#963; = 0.14). The study of melt inclusions in the liquidus olivine demonstrated that its parental melts have low-alumina, low-potassium compositions with up to 15.5 wt. % MgO and with an average water content of 5.5 wt. %. The data on volatile contents in the olivine-hosted melt inclusions suggest that the basic melts appeared due to partial melting of essentially peridotitic source with a small admixture of an olivine-free component at 1225&#176;&#1057; under active influence of the slab-related fluids. These fluids were separated from the subducting slab at 670&#8211;705&#176;&#1057; and depths of 95&#8211;105 km beneath the Iturup Island. The results of this study enhance our understanding of the evolution of basic magmas that serve as a heat and volatile supply during the formation of large calderas.</description>

                In order to assess observational evidence for potential atmospheric biosignatures on exoplanets, it will be essential to test whether spectral fingerprints from multiple gases can be explained by abiotic or biotic-only processes. Here, we develop and apply a coupled 1D atmosphere-ocean-ecosystem model to understand how primitive biospheres, which exploit abiotic sources of H2, CO and O2, could influence the atmospheric composition of rocky terrestrial exoplanets. We apply this to the Earth at 3.8 Ga and to TRAPPIST-1e. We focus on metabolisms that evolved before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis, which consume H2 and CO and produce potentially detectable levels of CH4. O2-consuming metabolisms are also considered for TRAPPIST-1e, as abiotic O2 production is predicted on M-dwarf orbiting planets. We show that these biospheres can lead to high levels of surface O2 (approximately 1-5 %) as a result of \ch{CO} consumption, which could allow high O2 scenarios, by removing the main loss mechanisms of atomic oxygen. Increasing stratospheric temperatures, which increases atmospheric OH can reduce the likelihood of such a state forming. O2-consuming metabolisms could also lower O2 levels to around 10 ppm and support a productive biosphere at low reductant inputs. Using predicted transmission spectral features from CH4, CO, O2/O3 and CO2 across the hypothesis space for tectonic reductant input, we show that biotically-produced CH4 may only be detectable at high reductant inputs. CO is also likely to be a dominant feature in transmission spectra for planets orbiting M-dwarfs, which could reduce the confidence in any potential biosignature observations linked to these biospheres.</description>

                Background: Low back pain is considered a public health problem internationally. Low back pain is a cause of disability that occurs in adolescents and causes negative effects in adults as well. The work environment and physical and psychosocial factors can influence the occurrence and evolution of low back pain. Methods: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the physiological and functional changes in young adults with painful conditions of the lumbar spine, after using exercise therapy. The study was of the longitudinal type and was carried out over a period 6 months in an outpatient setting. The rehabilitation treatment included electrotherapeutic modalities and kinesitherapy. Results: The results obtained when evaluating each parameter, for all moments, show statistically significant values in both groups. The results obtained regarding the relationship between the therapeutic modalities specific to rehabilitation medicine and low back pain are consistent with those reported in studies. Conclusions: Depending on the clinical-functional status of each patient, kinesitherapy can accelerate the heart rate and increase the blood pressure and oxygen saturation of the arterial blood, values that can later return to their initial levels, especially through training.</description>

                High-temperature in-situ Ni-K edge XAFS and SAXS measurements were conducted on borosilicate glasses with low alkali content with/without phase separation tendency, which have been investigated to understand immiscibility into silica-rich phase and borate-rich one on the samples heat-treated at certain temperature followed by fast quenching. In this work, using in-situ analyzing techniques, in-situ time-domain evolution of phases along temperature and time was obtained to understand high-temperature behavior. Ni2+ ion probes phase separation behavior using its high selectivity favoring borate-rich phase and sensitivity to electron donating ability of surrounding oxygens. Taking advantage of these characters, local compositional change was tracked during phase separation under heat treatment. Time-resolved SAXS profiles revealed the speed of phase transformation in addition to changes of morphology at respective temperature. The phase-separation transformation mechanism via different phase separation scheme (homogeneous &#8594; spinodal &#8594; binodal &#8594;homogeneous) was clearly described, revealing effect of NiO clustering at higher temperature.</description>

      <title>Continental fishery and risk of contamination of the halieutic ecosystems in the gbaga lagoon channel (Benin-Togo coastal zone)</title>

                Abstract. The coastal zones are areas where a very high number of lagoon-marine species reproduce, grow or transit, which are most often the object of halieutic exploitation. The present study aims to analyze the risk of contamination of fisheries ecosystems and its consequences on the evolution of aquatic resources in the coastal zone, more precisely from southwest Benin to southeast Togo. The methodology adopted is based on the collection and processing of raw data such as: hydrometric data, granulometric data, climatological data, data from fauna and flora inventories, completed by those from in situ measurements and those from laboratory analyses made from sediment samples and some species caught during fishing activities during the different hydrological seasons. The analysis of the results revealed that the pollution of the lagoon channel in Cd, As, Pb and some major ions such as Cl&#8722;, NO3- and PO43- are responsible for its eutrophication. Furthermore, organic matter and high concentrations of SS lead to the covering of aquatic environments, particularly spawning grounds and the smothering of eggs through the reduction of essential metabolic exchanges (oxygen and nutrient supply, evacuation of metabolic waste) through the reduction of the concentration of dissolved oxygen within the substrate. Trace element analysis in the flesh of Captain (Polydactylus quadrifilis), white grouper (Epinephelus aeneus), tilefish (Tilapia zillii), and white catfish samples revealed their trace element contamination levels. Behavioral effects (abandonment of shelter areas and avoidance reaction); sublethal effects (short-term reduction in feeding rate; minor physiological stress; increase in coughing frequency; increase in the breathing rhythm; moderate physiological stress; major; delayed hatching; reduced number of fish; mortality) were recorded. According to 89 % of the fishermen, the decrease of the fished fish species is registered during the dry periods, when the channel has a high level of contaminating heavy metals and major ions.</description>

                Abstract Alkali metal&#8211;air batteries (AMABs) promise ultrahigh gravimetric energy densities, while the inherent poor cycle stability hinders their practical application. To address this challenge, most previous efforts were devoted to advancing the air cathodes with high electrocatalytic activity. Recent studies have underlined the solid&#8211;liquid&#8211;gas triple&#8208;phase interface around the anode can play far more significant roles than previously acknowledged by the scientific community. Besides the bottlenecks of uncontrollable dendrite growth and gas evolution in conventional alkali metal batteries, the corrosive atmospheric gases, intermediate oxygen species, and redox mediators in AMABs cause more severe anode corrosion and structural collapse, posing greater challenges to the stabilization of the anode triple&#8208;phase interface. This work aims to provide a timely perspective on the anode interface engineering for durable AMABs. Taking the Li&#8211;air battery as a typical example, we have a critical review of the latest developed anode stabilization strategies, including formulating novel electrolytes to build protective interphases and alleviate corrosive attacks, fabricating advanced anodes to improve their anti&#8208;corrosion capability, and designing functional separator to shield the corrosive species. Finally, we highlight the remaining scientific and technical issues from the prospects of anode interface engineering, particularly materials system engineering, for the practical use of AMABs.

      <title>Impact of gas diffusion layer architecture on the performances of Cu-based electrodes for CO2 electroreduction to ethylene in flow reactors</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcou.2024.102772</link>

                Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising strategy to convert CO2 into fuels and building blocks for chemicals, exploiting renewable energy sources. Flow cells using gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) instead of simple H-cells are required to achieve higher production rates. In a GDE, CO2 diffuses through a porous gas diffusion layer (GDL) and reaches the active sites located in the catalyst layer; the GDL is a crucial component that can affect the performance of the GDE. In this work, we aimed to establish the parameters of the GDL that influence the selectivity toward the different CO2 reduction products in an alkaline flow reactor. We employed commercial Cu nanoparticles as electrocatalyst and selected a range of market-available GDLs: the structure, composition, and type of cracks of the GDL greatly influence the Faradaic Efficiency (FE) of CO, H2, and ethylene (C2H4). With the emphasis on C2H4, it was found that using a crack-free GDE is essential to get higher FEC2H4. At the same time, larger and more abundant cracks are detrimental to C2H4 production and promote hydrogen evolution: for instance, the FEC2H4 varies in the wide range of 13&#8211;32%, from the highly cracked to the crack-free GDL. The presence of both sulfur and oxygen in the microporous layer (MPL) of the GDL helps shift the CO2RR selectivity toward CO. The (in)stability of the GDEs at high current density has been correlated with a change in the wetting properties of the GDE and a loss in hydrophobicity.</description>

                One of the significant challenges of vanadium redox flow batteries is connected to the negative electrode where the main reaction of V(ii)/V(iii) and the side reaction of hydrogen evolution compete. To address this issue, we used titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene coating via drop-casting to introduce oxygen functional groups and metals on the carbon electrode surface. Characterization through scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed the even distribution of Ti3C2Tx MXene on the electrodes and the presence of titanium and termination groups (-O, -Cl, and -F). The cyclic voltammetry analysis of MXene-coated electrodes showed more sharp electrochemical peaks for the V(ii)/V(iii) reaction than thermal-treated electrodes, even at relatively high scan rates. Notably, a relatively high reaction rate of 5.61 &#215; 10-4 cm s-1 was achieved for the V(ii)/V(iii) reaction on MXene-coated electrodes, which shows the competitiveness of the method compared to thermal treatment (4.17 &#215; 10-4 cm s-1). The flow battery tests, at a current density of 130 mA cm-2, using MXene-coated electrodes showed pretty stable discharge capacity for over 100 cycles. In addition, the voltage and energy efficiency were significantly higher than those of the system using untreated electrodes. Overall, this work highlights the potential application of MXene coating in carbon electrode treatment for vanadium redox flow batteries due to remarkable electrocatalytic activity and battery performance, providing a competitive method for thermal treatment.</description>

      <title>Expanding the landscape of anti-MoS2 monolayers: computational exploration of stability and multifaceted properties across the periodic table</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s40843-024-2861-2</link>
      <description>Fengyu Li, Yu Liu, Linke Yu, Xiaodong Liu, Peng Jin, Zhongfang Chen, Science China. Materials. 67(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394936891

                Inspired by the distinctive structural and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we conducted comprehensive high-throughput first-principles computations to screen stable 2D chalcogenides X2T (X = transition metals Sc&#8211;Hg, totally 29 and main group elements Li&#8211;Ba, totally 37; T = S, Se, and Te) with anti-MoS2 configurations in both 1T and 2H phases. Among 396 evaluated candidates, the selected X2T monolayers (X = Sc, Fe, Y, Zr, Nb, Hf, Ta, IA elements Li&#8211;Fr, IIA elements Ca&#8211;Ra, N, In, Tl, and Te; T = S, Se, or Te) demonstrate outstanding thermodynamic, dynamic, mechanical properties, and thermal stabilities in 1T/1T&#8242; or 2H phases. These anti-MoS2 variants exhibit diverse characteristics, serving as nonmagnetic/magnetic metals or nonmagnetic/antiferromagnetic semiconductors, often surpassing MoS2 in Young's modulus and/or displaying negative Poisson's ratios. Transition-metal-based monolayers show susceptibility to O2 oxidization, and some show high N2 dissociation activity. Oxygen/nitrogen-terminations can quench TM magnetism and increase band-gaps over their pristine counterparts. Notably, the 2H-Fe2S monolayer maintains robust antiferromagnetism upon O-termination. Moreover, TM-based X2T sheets demonstrate promise as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions. This study expands the diversity of 2D materials with new members and novel functional properties and broadens their potential applications.</description>

                This study focuses on the synthesis of mixed metal oxide anodes (MMOs) with the composition Ti/RuO2Sb2O4Ptx (where x = 0, 5, 10 mol) using hybrid microwave irradiation heating. The synthesized electrodes were characterized using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray energy-dispersive analysis, X-ray diffraction, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. These electrodes were then evaluated in both bulk electrolytic and fuel cell tests within a reversible chloralkaline electrochemical cell. The configurations using the electrodes Ti/(RuO2)0.7-(Sb2O4)0.3 and Ti/(RuO2)66.5-(Sb2O4)28.5-Pt5 presented lower onset potential for oxygen and chlorine evolution reactions and reduced resistance to charge transfer compared to the Ti/(RuO2)63-(Sb2O4)27-Pt10 variant. These electrodes demonstrated notable performance in reversible electrochemical cells, achieving Coulombic efficiencies of up to 60% when operating in the electrolytic mode at current densities of 150 mA cm&#8722;2. They also reached maximum power densities of 1.2 mW cm&#8722;2 in the fuel cell. In both scenarios, the presence of platinum in the MMO coating positively influenced the process. Furthermore, a significant challenge encountered was crossover through the membranes, primarily associated with gaseous Cl2. This study advances our understanding of reversible electrochemical cells and presents possibilities for further exploration and refinement. It demonstrated that the synergy of innovative electrode synthesis strategies and electrochemical engineering can lead to promising and sustainable technologies for energy conversion.</description>

      <title>A New Model of Carbon Nitride as a Substrate to Support Single Metal Atom</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c00975</link>
      <description>Pan Du, Shengwei Deng, Liang Chen, Ziqi Tian, Journal of physical chemistry. C./Journal of physical chemistry. C. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394933990

                Carbon nitrides are commonly employed as substrates to anchor single metal atoms. Numerous theoretical studies have previously characterized these single-atom systems using the pristine g-C3N4 structure, featuring a C6N7 motif. However, the relatively large pores in g-C3N4 may not effectively coordinate with metal cations, resulting in discordance with the coordination environment determined by experimental characterization. In this study, we introduce a novel model denoted as CN-N4, which preserves the essential g-C3N4 motif, while offering four nitrogen sites for metal binding. Compared with g-C3N4, the binding affinity between the metal and this new substrate model is significantly enhanced, similar to that of a commonly studied nitrogen-doped graphene model (N-gra). Additionally, we have assessed the catalytic performance in various reactions, including the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The CN-N4-supported system exhibits activity comparable to that of the corresponding N-gra-supported species. Fe- and Co-centered SACs can be promising catalysts for ORR, and relatively stable Cu-g-C3N4 is active to HER and CO2RR, consistent with reported experiments. In addition, V-CN-N4 and Rh-CN-N4 are predicted to be candidates to catalyze the HER and ORR, respectively. We suggest that the CN-N4 model aptly captures the local structure of carbon nitride-based materials with a high coordination number, providing an alternative foundation for investigating the reaction mechanisms of these single-atom catalysts.</description>

      <title>Enhanced H2 photoproduction in sodium sulfite-treated Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by optimizing wavelength of pulsed light</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.04.176</link>

                Photosynthetic hydrogen induced by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii presents a promising pathway for producing clean and renewable biofuel. Whereas, this process is transient owing to the repression of [FeFe]-hydrogenase by the oxygen co-evolved in photosystem II. Pulsed light is employed to prevent O2 accumulation and the activation of Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle for sustainable H2. While light quality significantly influences photosynthesis, the optimal wavelength for pulsed light-induced H2 production remains not fully elucidated. Continuous irradiation at 660&#8211;670 nm performs poorly in H2 production due to the activation of PSII, which is responsible for water oxidation. However, in this study, O2 was removed using a combination of pulsed light and sulfite treatment. Among six light regimes with different wavelengths, pulsed light peaking at 660 nm resulted in the highest photo-H2 evolution, reaching approximately 180 mL L&#8722;1 within three days. This value was 1.4 times higher than that achieved under conventionally white pulsed light. Exposure to 660 nm red pulsed light not only sustained high activity of PSII and hydrogenase but also reduced the gene expression levels of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase, which was supposed to attenuate the competing effects of CBB cycle. This finding optimizes an efficient light source for pulsed light-induced H2 production and demonstrates a great potential for refining pulsed light parameters to improve H2 production in algae in the future.</description>

      <title>Tracing rate and extent of human induced hypoxia during the last 200 years in the mesotrophic lake Tiefer See (NE Germany)</title>

                Abstract. The global spread of lake hypoxia, [O2] &lt; 2 mg/l, during the last two centuries has a severe impact on ecological systems and sedimentation processes. While the occurance of hypoxia was observed in many lakes, a detailed quantification of hypoxia spread remained largely unquantified. We track the evolution of hypoxia and its controls during the past 200 yrs in lake Tiefer See (TSK; NE Germany) using 17 gravity cores, recovered between 10 and 62 m water depth in combination with lake monitoring data. Lake hypoxia was associated by the onset of varve preservation in the TSK, and has been dated by varve counting to 1918&#177;1 at 62 m water depth and reached a lake-floor depth of 16 m at 1997&#177;1. This indicates oxygen concentration to fell below the threshold for varve preservation at the lakefloor (&gt;16 m). Sediment cores at 10&#8211;12 m depth do not contain varves indicating well oxygenation of the upper water column. Monitoring data show that the threshold for hypoxia at the depocenter is a period of five months of [O2] &lt; 5 mgl and two months of [O2] &lt; 2 mgl . Detailed TOC, &#948;13Corg and XRF core scanning analyses of the short cores indicate that the depletion in DO started several decades prior to the varve preservation. This proves a change in the depositional conditions in the lake following a transition phase of several decades during which varve preservation was not accomplished. Furthermore, varve preservation does occur at seasonal stratification and not necessarily requires permanent stratification.</description>

      <title>Optimizing photosynthetic light-harvesting under stars: Generalized thermodynamic models</title>

                Abstract Since the law of physics and chemistry are universal, we must be able to use them to determine the feasibility and potential characteristics of photosynthetic life on exoplanets. Photosynthesis is the cornerstone of Earth&#8217;s complex biosphere and creates bio-signatures pivotal in the search for life beyond Earth. However, stars of lower temperature (&#119931;&#119956;) diminish the intersection between the irradiance at an exoplanet's surface and the wavelengths of light (400 nm &#8804; &#120640; &lt; 700 nm) required for oxygenic photosynthesis, which includes Earth&#8217;s plants and cyanobacteria. This does not automatically preclude photosynthesis around such stars, since Earth's photosynthetic organisms have developed highly-specialized light-harvesting structures, known as antennae, to overcome extremely light-limiting conditions. Here, we construct a generalized thermodynamic model of a photosynthetic antenna and evaluate photosynthetic performance across various stellar spectra. We demonstrate that the light-harvesting process, entailing the capture of light across a broad area and channeling it to a small reaction centre, encounters an intrinsic entropic barrier that constrains its efficiency. Through structural and energetic optimizations of our model, we uncover strategies to alleviate the entropic barrier, akin to those seemingly adopted during the evolution of cyanobacteria. We propose that a cyanobacterial-like antenna is thermodynamically optimized even for the coolest M-dwarf stars (&#119931;&#119956; &#8764; 2300 K) while a plant-like antenna would face severe entropic constraints. By incorporating thermodynamics into biology, our models help linearize the search for photosynthesis based on the stellar spectra an exoplanet receives.</description>

                Optimizing electrosynthetic reactions requires fine tuning of a vast chemical space, including charge transfer at electrocatalyst/electrode surfaces, engineering of mass transport limitations and complex interactions of reactants and products with their environment. Hybrid electrolytes, in which supporting salt ions and subtrates are dissolved in a binary mixture of organic solvent and water, represent a new piece to this complex puzzle, as they offer a unique opportunity to harvest water as the oxygen or proton source in electrosynthesis. In this work, we demonstrate that modulating water-organic solvent interactions drastically impacts the solvation properties of hybrid electrolytes. Combining various spectroscopies with synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that the size and composition of aqueous domains forming in hybrid electrolytes can be controlled. We demonstrate that water is more reactive for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in aqueous domains than when strongly interacting with solvent molecules, which originates from a change in reaction kinetics rather than from a thermodynamic effect. We examplify novel opportunities arising from this new knowledge for optimizing electrosynthetic reactions in hybrid electrolytes. For reactions proceeding first via the activation of water, fine tuning of aqueous domains impact the kinetics and potentially the selectivity of the reaction. Instead, for organic substrates reacting prior to water, aqueous domains have no impact on reaction kinetics, while selectivity may be affected. We believe that such fine comprehension of solvation properties of hybrid electrolytes can be transposed to numerous electrosynthetic reactions.</description>

      <title>Origin and evolution of a porphyry-skarn-stratabound system: Constraints from geology, magmatic-hydrothermal zircon U&#8211;Pb and molybdenite Re&#8211;Os geochronology, and in situ S isotopes of the Dongguashan Cu(&#8211;Au) deposit, eastern China</title>

                Intrusion-related stratabound deposits within Late Carboniferous carbonate units are an abundant and highly economically significant ore type in eastern China. In such deposits, stratabound mineralization commonly coexists with porphyry and/or skarn mineralization, and the vast majority of reserves (&gt;90 %) are derived from extensive stratabound orebodies, which are easy to exploit and of great interest to geologists. However, it is unclear whether these deposits were formed via the Late Carboniferous seafloor sedimentary exhalation formation or the Early Cretaceous magmatic-hydrothermal processes. Moreover, the fluid and sulfur isotope variations within porphyry-skarn-stratabound systems have not been adequately constrained. We investigated the Dongguashan deposit, one of the largest and most representative stratabound Cu(&#8211;Au) deposits in eastern China. Three mineralization types were recognized based on field and petrologic studies: porphyry, skarn, and stratabound. In the stratabound mineralization zone, magmatic and hydrothermal zircons from laminated ores yielded concordant U&#8211;Pb ages of 137.3 &#177; 1.1 and 135.7 &#177; 1.4 Ma, respectively, while molybdenite samples from vein-like ores yielded Re&#8211;Os model ages of 137.8&#8211;133.1 Ma (isochron age, 135.9 &#177; 1.4 Ma). These ages were consistent with the zircon U&#8211;Pb age of quartz monzodiorite (137.8 &#177; 1.7 Ma). A total of 146 in situ S isotope analyses yielded &#948;34S values (1.9&#8211;7.4 &#8240;) indicating that the sulfur was derived from a magmatic source. Therefore, the Dongguashan deposit resulted from Early Cretaceous magmatism rather than submarine exhalative sedimentary processes. The fluctuations in S isotopes of sulfides across the three mineralization types are attributable to different factors (pH, temperature, and oxygen fugacity) during the evolution of hydrothermal ore-forming fluids. This study demonstrates the importance of geochronology of mineralization and in situ sulfur isotope analysis under robust geological and petrographic frameworks, which can yield information about the ore-forming processes and ore genesis.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Eutectic of Isodimorphism to Design Biaxially-Oriented Bio-Based PA56/512 with High Strength, Toughness and Barrier Performances</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/polym16081176</link>
      <description>Diansong Gan, Yuejun Liu, Tianhui Hu, Shuhong Fan, Lingna Cui, Guangkai Liao, Zhiyuan Xie, Xiaoyu Zhu, Kejian Yang, Polymers. 16(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4395010628

                The biaxially-oriented PA56/512 has excellent mechanical strength, extensibility and water&#8211;oxygen barrier properties and has broad application prospects in green packaging, lithium battery diaphragm and medical equipment materials. The correlation between the aggregation structure evolution and macroscopic comprehensive properties of copolymer PA56/512 under biaxial stretching has been demonstrated in this work. The structure of the random copolymerization sequence was characterized by 13C Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The typical isodimorphism behavior of the co-crystallization system of PA56/512 and its BOPA-56/512 films was revealed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests. And the aggregation structure, including the hydrogen bond arrangement, crystal structure and crystal morphology of PA56/512 before and after biaxial stretching, was investigated by XRD, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) tests. Furthermore, the effect of the biaxially-oriented stretching process on the mechanical properties of PA56/512 has been demonstrated. In addition, a deep insight into the influence of the structure on the crystallization process and physical&#8211;mechanical performance has been presented. The lowest melting point at a 512 content of 60 mol% is regarded as a &#8220;eutectic&#8221; point of the isodimorphism system. Due to the high disorder of the structural units in the polymer chain, the transition degree of the folded chain (gauche conformation) is relatively lowest when it is straightened to form an extended chain (trans conformation) during biaxially-oriented stretching, and part of the folded chain can be retained. This explains why biaxially stretched PA56/512 has high strength, outstanding toughness and excellent barrier properties at the pseudo-eutectic point. In this study, using the unique multi-scale aggregation structure characteristics of a heterohomodymite polyamide at the pseudo-eutectic point, combined with the new material design scheme and the idea of biaxial-stretching processing, a new idea for customized design of high-performance multifunctional polyamide synthetic materials is provided.</description>

                The local structure of &#946;&#8208;(Al x Ga 1&#8208;x ) 2 O 3 alloys for various Al contents has been determined from extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) performed at the Ga K&#8208;edge. A model to fit the experimental EXAFS data of the monoclinic &#946;&#8208;(Al x Ga 1&#8208;x ) 2 O 3 alloy has been suggested to independently determine relevant local structure parameters. An increase in compositional disorder corresponding to the near neighbours (NNs) for lower Al contents establishes that the Al atom does occupy tetrahedron atomic sites in addition to octahedron sites even for smaller Al contents. The NNs and next&#8208;nearest neighbours (NNNs) bond lengths corresponding to tetrahedron and octahedron coordinated Gallium (Ga) atoms with the surrounding Oxygen (O) atoms as well as tetrahedron&#8208;tetrahedron/octahedron&#8208;octahedron coordinated Ga&#8208;Ga atoms on average display a decreasing trend with the Al content up to x=33.3% and then they do not change much with a further increase in Al content. While, tetrahedron&#8208;octahedron coordinated Ga&#8208;Ga atoms move far from each other with the Al content up to x=33.3% and then it does not change much. The physical picture derived from the EXAFS analysis indicates the creation of tetrahedra and octahedra sublattices at the local level for &#946;&#8208;(Al x Ga 1&#8208;x ) 2 O 3 alloys, and their sizes decrease, but they move far apart from each other up to a certain Al content. Thereafter, their sizes and the distance between them do not change much. Thus, the EXAFS results provide a clear insight into the evolution of the local structure of &#946;&#8208;(Al x Ga 1&#8208;x ) 2 O 3 alloys with the Al content, which may be useful for a better understanding of their physical properties.

      <title>Natural radioactivity of the crust as an important factor of the chemical evolution of the early Earth</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.precamres.2024.107400</link>

                The long-lived (billions of years) 40K, 235U, 238U, and 232Th isotopes have a high energy capacity and represent a potent internal source of energy. Together with the external action of the Sun, the natural radioactivity was apparently an important component of evolution of the early Earth and development of Earth's life. The decay of isotopes initiated radiation chemical reactions involving water, which were accompanied by the formation of hydrogen and oxygen and the transformation of Earth's inorganic matter into organic compounds, including prebiotic molecules. Water radiolysis in the Earth's crust continuously produces H2, which is now considered as the main electron donor (food) for microorganisms several kilometers below the Earth's surface. Here we calculate the initial radioactivity of the early Earth's crust from the relative abundances of elements and dynamics of variation of the radioactivity and energy release upon the decay of particular radioactive isotopes. The energy released upon the decay of heavy 235U, 238U, and 232Th throughout the existence of the Earth (4.6 billion years) was 4.5 &#215; 1030 J, while the energy released upon the decay of 40K was approximately 1.0 &#215; 1030 J. The energy release per year during the first billion years decreased from 3.0 &#215; 1021 J to 1.5 &#215; 1021 J for heavy isotopes and from 0.70 &#215; 1021 J to 0.45 &#215; 1021 J for 40K. Over the last billion years, the energy decreased approximately threefold. Analysis of the data on the radiation chemical formation of hydrogen in the wet components of the Earth's crust (cements, zeolites, geopolymers, and other) and bottom sediments indicates that hydrogen is formed upon direct action of radiation on water in yields characteristic of pure water. According to calculations, over the past 4 billion years, approximately 1.7 &#215; 1022 M of hydrogen was formed. Furthermore, &#8764;93 % of H2 was due to the decay of uranium and thorium, while the contribution of 40K did not exceed 7 %. The global rate of hydrogen formation in the Earth's crust is &#8764; 1.5 &#215; 1012 mol per year. A mechanism involving ionic and radical products of water radiolysis was proposed to describe the formation of prebiotic molecules (amino acids, sugars, etc.) from carbon-, nitrogen-, and sulfur-containing inorganic compounds.</description>

                Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), first described in 1967, is characterized by acute respiratory failure causing profound hypoxemia, decreased pulmonary compliance, and bilateral CXR infiltrates. After several descriptions, the Berlin definition was adopted in 2012, which established three categories of severity according to hypoxemia (mild, moderate and severe), specified temporal aspects for diagnosis, and incorporated the use of non-invasive ventilation. The COVID-19 pandemic led to changes in ARDS management, focusing on continuous monitoring of oxygenation and on utilization of high-flow oxygen therapy and lung ultrasound. In 2021, a New Global Definition based on the Berlin definition of ARDS was proposed, which included a category for non-intubated patients, considered the use of SpO2, and established no particular requirement for oxygenation support in regions with limited resources. Although debates persist, the continuous evolution seeks to adapt to clinical and epidemiological needs, and to the search of personalized treatments. El s&#237;ndrome de dificultad respiratoria aguda (SDRA), inicialmente descrito en 1967, se caracteriza por insuficiencia respiratoria aguda con hipoxemia profunda, disminuci&#243;n de la distensibilidad pulmonar e infiltrados bilaterales en la Rx de t&#243;rax. En 2012 la definici&#243;n de Berl&#237;n, estableci&#243; tres categor&#237;as en base a la hipoxemia (SDRA leve, moderado y grave), precisando aspectos temporales y permitiendo el diagn&#243;stico con ventilaci&#243;n no invasiva. La pandemia de COVID-19 llev&#243; a reconsiderar la definici&#243;n, enfoc&#225;ndose en el monitoreo continuo de la oxigenaci&#243;n y la oxigenoterapia de alto flujo. En 2021, se propuso una Nueva Definici&#243;n Global de SDRA, basada en la definici&#243;n de Berl&#237;n pero incluyendo una categor&#237;a para pacientes no intubados, permitiendo el uso de SpO2/FiO2 y la ecograf&#237;a pulmonar para el diagn&#243;stico, y sin ning&#250;n requerimiento de soporte especial de la oxigenaci&#243;n en regiones con recursos limitados. Aunque persisten debates, la evoluci&#243;n continua busca adaptarse a las necesidades cl&#237;nicas y epidemiol&#243;gicas, y personalizar tratamientos.</description>

      <title>Hydrothermal Alteration Processes of Xincheng Gold Deposit Jiaodong Peninsula, China: Constraints from Composition of Hydrothermal Rutile</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/min14040417</link>
      <description>Zhenjun Liu, Liqiang Yang, Dong Xie, Wei Yang, Dapeng Li, Tao Feng, Jun Deng, Minerals. 14(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394914778

                Delineating the process of hydrothermal alteration is crucial for effectively enhancing exploration strategies and better understanding the gold mineralization process. Rutile, with its capacity to accommodate a wide range of trace elements including high-field-strength elements and base metals, serves as a reliable fluid tracer in ore systems. As one of the most significant gold ore concentrations globally, Jiaodong boasts a gold reserve exceeding 5500 t. The Xincheng gold deposit is a world-class high-grade mine, boasting a proven gold reserve exceeding 200 t, and stands as one of the largest altered-type gold deposits in the vast gold province of the Jiaodong Peninsula, Eastern China. In this study, rutile (Rt1,2,3) was identified in the K-feldspar alteration, sericitization, and pyrite&#8211;sericite&#8211;quartz alteration stages of the Xincheng gold deposit in Jiaodong based on petrographic characteristics. Rt1 coexists with hydrothermal K-feldspar and quartz, while Rt2 coexists with minerals such as sericite, quartz, muscovite, and pyrite. Rt3 is widely distributed in hydrothermal veins and is primarily associated with minerals including quartz, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and sericite. Raman spectroscopy, EPMA, and LA-ICP-MS analysis were conducted to investigate the characteristics and evolution of altered hydrothermal fluids. This study indicates that the Zr vs. W and Nb/V vs. W diagrams suggest that Rt1 is of magmatic&#8211;hydrothermal origin, while Rt2 and Rt3 are of metamorphic&#8211;hydrothermal origin. Notably, the W content in Rt2 and Rt3 is significantly higher than in Rt1 (&lt;100 ppm), suggesting a close relationship between the W content in rutile and mineralization. The three types of rutile exhibit significantly different concentrations of trace elements such as W, V, Nb, Zr, Sn, and Fe, displaying distinct bright spots and elemental zoning characteristics in backscattered electron images and surface scans. These features arise from the isomorphic substitution of Ti4+. While Rt1 exhibits no significant element exchange with the hydrothermal fluids, Rt2 and Rt3 show a stronger substitution of W, Nb, V, and Fe, indicating a gradual enrichment of F and Cl in the fluids. This process activates and transports these elements into the fluids, leading to their continuous accumulation within the system. From Rt1 to Rt3, the increasing concentrations of Fe and W, along with the negative Eu anomaly, suggest a decrease in fluid temperature and oxygen fugacity during the alteration and mineralization process. The gradual increase in the contents of REEs and high-field-strength elements such as W, V, Nb, and Sn indicates that the hydrothermal fluids are enriched in F and Cl, exhibiting weak acidity. The nature of the fluids during hydrothermal alteration is closely related to the composition of rutile, making it a promising tool for studying hydrothermal alteration and related mineralization processes.</description>

      <title>How to Decipher Electrocatalytic Reactions with Theory and Computation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-t37bp</link>

                Electrocatalytic reactions, such as oxygen reduction/evolution reaction and CO2 reduction reaction that are pivotal for the energy transition, are multi-step processes occurring in a nanoscale electric double layer (EDL) at solid-liquid interfaces. Conventional analyses based on the Sabatier principle, using binding energies or effective electronic structure properties of the d-band center as descriptors, are able to grasp overall trends in catalytic activity in groups of catalysts. However, thermodynamic approaches fail to account for a plethora of electrolyte effects that arise in the EDL, including pH effects, cation effects, and anion effects. These effects have been observed to strongly influence electrocatalytic reactions. There is a growing consensus that the local reaction environment (LRE) prevailing in the EDL is the key to deciphering these complex and hitherto perplexing electrolyte effects. Equal attention is thus paid to designing appropriate electrolytes, positioning the LRE at center stage. Achieving this is essential for designing electrocatalysts with specifically tailored properties, which could enable much needed breakthroughs in electrochemical energy science. Theory and modeling are becoming increasingly important and powerful in addressing this multifaceted problem that involves physical phenomena at different scales interacting in a multidimensional parametric space. Theoretical models developed for this purpose should treat intrinsic multistep kinetics of electrocatalytic reactions, EDL effects from sub-nm scale to the scale of 10 nm, and mass transport phenomena bridging scales from &lt; 0.1 to 100 &#956;m. Given the diverse physical phenomena and scales involved, it is evident that the challenge at hand surpasses the capabilities of any single theoretical or computational approach. In this Account, we present a hierarchical theoretical framework to address the above challenge. It seamlessly integrates several modules: (i) a comprehensive microkinetic model accounting for various reaction pathways; (ii) an LRE model that describes the interfacial region extending from the nanometric EDL continuously to the solution bulk; (iii) first-principles calculations that provide parameters, e.g., adsorption energies, activation barriers and EDL parameters. The microkinetic model considers all elementary steps without designating an a priori rate-determining step. The kinetics of these elementary steps are expressed in terms of local concentrations, potential and electric field that are co-determined by EDL charging and mass transport in the LRE model. New insights on electrode kinetic phenomena, i.e., potential-dependent Tafel slopes, cation effects, and pH effects, obtained from this hierarchical framework are then reviewed. Finally, an outlook on further improvement of the model framework is presented, in view of recent developments in first-principles based simulation of electrocatalysis, observations of dynamic reconstruction of catalysts, and machine-learning assisted computational simulations</description>

Through social distancing, hand sanitizers, masking, and vaccination the public has become aware of how mitigation measures can be used to reduce both the exposure and the hazard associated with a microbial pathogen and ultimately reduce the risk of infection or disease. These principles of hazard determination, exposure control and mitigation are fundamental to microbial risk assessment. In this chapter, the reader will be introduced to the principles of microbial risk assessment and how they can be applied to assess the risk and develop appropriate mitigation strategies across a broad range of microbial pathogens and media. The chapter will also highlight how microbial risk assessment differs and is similar to chemical risk assessment. References Abe , H. , Koyama , K. , Kawamura , S. , and Koseki , S. ( 2019 ).
