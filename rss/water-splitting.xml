      <title>A Highly Reversible Sn&#8208;Air Battery Possessing the Ultra&#8208;Low Charging Potential with the Assistance of Light</title>

      <description>Mingze Gao, Ruiya Wang, Xinxin L&#252;, Yanchen Fan, Ziyang Guo, Yonggang Wang, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399011156

                Aqueous Sn&#8208;air batteries are attracting a great deal of interest in recent years due to the ultra&#8208;high safety, low cost, dendrite&#8208;free and highly reversible Sn anode. However, the slurry oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics on the air cathodes seriously affect the Sn&#8208;air battery performances. Although various advanced catalysts have been developed, the charge overpotentials (~1000 mV) of these Sn&#8208;air batteries are still not satisfactory. Herein, iron oxide (Fe2O3) modified titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorods with heterogeneous structure are firstly synthesized on Ti mesh (Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti), and the obtained Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti is further applied as catalytic electrodes for Sn&#8208;air batteries. The core&#8208;shell heterogeneous structure of Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can effectively facilitate the conversion of electrochemical intermediates and separation of photo&#8208;excited electrons and holes to active oxygen&#8208;related reaction processes. DFT and experimental results also confirm that Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can not only act as the electrocatalysts to improve ORR/OER properties, but also exhibit the superior photo&#8208;catalytic activity to promote charge kinetics. Hence, the Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Sn&#8208;air batteries show ultra&#8208;low overpotential of ~40 mV, excellent rate capability and good cycling stability under light irradiation. This work will shed light on rational photo&#8208;assisted catalytic cathode design for new&#8208;type metal&#8208;air batteries.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Oxygen Evolution and Zinc&#8208;Air Battery Performance via Electronic Spin Modulation in Heterostructured Catalysts</title>

                Abstract Beyond optimizing electronic energy levels, the modulation of the electronic spin configuration is an effective strategy, often overlooked, to boost activity and selectivity in a range of catalytic reactions, including the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This electronic spin modulation is frequently accomplished using external magnetic fields, which makes it impractical for real applications. Herein, spin modulation is achieved by engineering Ni/MnFe 2 O 4 heterojunctions, whose surface is reconstructed into NiOOH/MnFeOOH during the OER. NiOOH/MnFeOOH shows a high spin state of Ni, which regulates the OH &#8208; and O 2 adsorption energy and enables spin alignment of oxygen intermediates. As a result, NiOOH/MnFeOOH electrocatalysts provide excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 261 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 . Besides, rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries based on Ni/MnFe 2 O 4 show a high open circuit potential of 1.56 V and excellent stability for more than 1000 cycles. This outstanding performance is rationalized using density functional theory calculations, which show that the optimal spin state of both Ni active sites and oxygen intermediates facilitates spin&#8208;selected charge transport, optimizes the reaction kinetics, and decreases the energy barrier to the evolution of oxygen. This study provides valuable insight into spin polarization modulation by heterojunctions enabling the design of next&#8208;generation OER catalysts with boosted performance.

      <title>Iron, Tungsten Dual&#8208;Doped Nickel Sulfide as Efficient Bifunctional Catalyst for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202311770</link>
      <description>Sangni Wang, Ding Yuan, Sihan Sun, Shuhan Huang, Yirong Wu, Lei Zhang, Shi Xue Dou, Huan Liu, Yihua Dou, Jiantie Xu, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399021892

                Abstract Developing low&#8208;cost and highly efficient bifunctional catalysts for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a challenging problem in electrochemical overall water splitting. Here, iron, tungsten dual&#8208;doped nickel sulfide catalyst (Fe/W&#8208;Ni 3 S 2 ) is synthesized on the nickel foam, and it exhibits excellent OER and HER performance. As a result, the water electrolyze based on Fe/W&#8208;Ni 3 S 2 bifunctional catalyst illustrates 10 mA cm &#8722;2 at 1.69 V (without iR &#8208;compensation) and highly durable overall water splitting over 100 h tested under 500 mA cm &#8722;2 . Experimental results and DFT calculations indicate that the synergistic interaction between Fe doping and Ni vacancy induced by W leaching during the in situ oxidation process can maximize exposed OER active sites on the reconstructed NiOOH species for accelerating OER kinetics, while the Fe/W dual&#8208;doping optimizes the electronic structure of Fe/W&#8208;Ni 3 S 2 and the binding strength of intermediates for boosting HER. This study unlocks the different promoting mechanisms of incorporating Fe and W for boosting the OER and HER activity of Ni 3 S 2 for water splitting, which provides significant guidance for designing high&#8208;performance bifunctional catalysts for overall water splitting.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric oxygen plasma-activated novel multicomponent transition metal phosphides (MnCoCu&#8211;P) for enhanced electrocatalytic water splitting to green hydrogen production: A universal catalyst across various pH electrolytes</title>

                Hydrogen (H2) is widely acknowledged as a promising, sustainable, and environmentally friendly energy carrier, offering numerous environmental benefits over conventional fossil fuels. However, the advancement of this technology is severely hindered by the scarcity of effective and robust catalysts for hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions activity. This study marks the inaugural fabrication of a hybrid tri-metallic electrocatalyst, termed MnCoCu&#8211;P, through hydrothermal synthesis. Subsequently, the catalyst undergoes atmospheric O2 plasma surface activation, aiming to amplify the efficiency of water splitting. The novel atmospheric O2 plasma-activated MnCoCu&#8211;P electrode outperforms the reported classic metal phosphides, and it outperformed the compared commercial Pt/C and RuO2 benchmark catalysts with outstanding performances of 0.488 and 1.20 V towards HER and OER at 1000 mA/cm2, respectively. Additionally, the MnCoCu&#8211;P (5 min) catalyst Faradic efficiency was calculated under alkaline conditions in 1.0 M KOH, and both the produced gas H2 and O2 match the theoretical and experimental calculated values well, indicating a high efficiency of almost 100%. In the 2-E system, MnCoCu&#8211;P (5 min)&#8214;MnCoCu&#8211;P (5 min) demonstrated remarkable performance by attaining a current density of 1000 mA/cm2 at low total cell voltages of 1.93 V and outperforming the benchmark Pt/C&#8214;RuO2 electrode system. On the other hand, the MnCoCu&#8211;P electrode possesses excellent activity under industrial conditions at 6.0 M @ 60 &#176;C exhibited 1.89 V at 1000 mA/cm2 and performs well in natural water systems. Moreover, the 5 min O2 plasma-treated MnCoCu&#8211;P&#8214;MnCoCu&#8211;P electrodes showed improved activity in all the pH solutions which makes it one of the potential candidates for commercial application in the future.</description>

      <title>Oxygen-Evolution Reaction on Nickel Oxyhydroxide&#8217;s Surface: Toward a Super Catalyst for Oxygen-Evolution Reaction with Ultralow Overpotentials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.4c00888</link>

                This study challenges the conventional understanding of nickel (hydr)oxides as inefficient catalysts for oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions. It is demonstrated that nickel oxyhydroxide, characterized by several methods, forms on Ni foam's surface and exhibits OER activity at extremely low potentials. This activity becomes particularly notable at the peak of Ni(II) oxidation to Ni(III), which follows charge accumulation. Remarkably, this mesoporous, super hydrophilic, and high-surface-area catalyst requires a minimal overpotential, as low as 130 mV, with a current density of 200 &#956;A/cm2, and displays a Tafel slope of 77.9 mV/decade in alkaline media (0.10 M KOH). Considering the amount of oxygen produced and the concentration of redox-active Ni ions in the redox peak region, the turnover frequency was calculated to be 1.1 &#215; 10&#8211;3 s&#8211;1 at a potential of 1.36 V. Achieving these parameters at such a remarkably low overpotential holds significant promise. This study also proposes a mechanism for OER at this low overpotential, based on in situ Raman spectroscopic analysis of the Ni(II) to Ni(III) oxidation peak and the OER region. The observed low overpotential for OER can be attributed to the complex interplay between the OER process and the phenomenon of charge accumulation. All these factors result in an exceptionally low overpotential for OER. Our findings hold profound implications for the development of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for OER, particularly in water-splitting applications. This research not only expands our understanding of nickel oxyhydroxide as a potential OER catalyst but also opens avenues for future exploration in electrocatalysis.</description>

                Triggering the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism is crucial for improving oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, because it could bypass the scaling relation limitation associated with the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism through the directly formation of oxygen&#8722;oxygen bond. High&#8208;valence transition metal sites are favorable for activating the lattice oxygen, but the deep oxidation of pre&#8208;catalysts suffers from a high thermodynamic barrier. Here, taking advantage of the Jahn&#8722;Teller (J&#8722;T) distortion induced structural instability, we incorporate high&#8208;spin Mn3+ (t2g3eg1) dopant into Co4N. Mn dopants enable a surface structural transformation from Co4N to CoOOH, and finally to CoO2, as observed by various in&#8208;situ spectroscopic investigations. Furthermore, the reconstructed surface on Mn doped Co4N triggers the lattice oxygen activation, as evidenced experimentally by pH&#8208;dependent OER, tetramethylammonium cation adsorption and on&#8208;line electrochemical mass spectrometry measurements of 18O&#8208;labelled catalysts. In general, this work not only offers the introducing J&#8722;T effect approach to regulate the structural transition, but also provides an understanding about the influence of catalyst&#8217;s electronic configuration on determining the reaction route, which may inspire the design of more efficient catalysts with activated lattice oxygen.</description>

                Abstract Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) offer the potential for high&#8208;efficiency power generation and green hydrogen production at intermediate temperatures. However, the commercial viability of R&#8208;PCECs is hampered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) within conventional air electrodes operating at reduced temperatures. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach based on the simultaneous optimization of bulk&#8208;phase metal&#8208;oxygen bonds and in&#8208;situ formation of a metal oxide nano&#8208;catalyst surface modification. This strategy is designed to expedite the ORR/OER electrocatalytic activity of air electrodes exhibiting triple (O 2&#8722; , H + , e &#8722; ) conductivity. Specifically, our engineered air electrode nanocomposite&#8208;Ba(Co 0.4 Fe 0.4 Zr 0.1 Y 0.1 ) 0.95 Ni 0.05 F 0.1 O 2.9&#8208;&#948; demonstrates remarkable ORR/OER catalytic activity and exceptional durability in R&#8208;PCECs. This is evidenced by significantly improved peak power density from 626 mW cm &#8722;2 to 996 mW cm &#8722;2 and highly stable reversibility over a 100&#8208;hour cycling period.

                Abstract Alternative strategies to design sustainable&#8208;element&#8208;based electrocatalysts enhancing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics are demanded to develop affordable yet high&#8208;performance water&#8208;electrolyzers for green hydrogen production. Here, it is demonstrated that the spontaneous&#8208;spin&#8208;polarized 2D &#960;&#8208;d conjugated framework comprising abundant elements of nickel and iron with a ratio of Ni:Fe = 1:4 with benzenehexathiol linker (BHT) can improve OER kinetics by its unique electronic property. Among the bimetallic NiFe x:y &#8208;BHTs with various ratios with Ni:Fe = x:y, the NiFe 1:4 &#8208;BHT exhibits the highest OER activity. The NiFe 1:4 &#8208;BHT shows a specific current density of 140 A g &#8722;1 at the overpotential of 350 mV. This performance is one of the best activities among state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;precious OER electrocatalysts and even comparable to that of the platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metals of RuO 2 and IrO 2 . The density functional theory calculations uncover that introducing Ni into the homometallic Fe&#8208;BHT (e.g., Ni:Fe = 0:1) can emerge a spontaneous&#8208;spin&#8208;polarized state. Thus, this material can achieve improved OER kinetics with spin&#8208;polarization which previously required external magnetic fields. This work shows that a rational design of 2D &#960;&#8208;d conjugated frameworks can be a powerful strategy to synthesize promising electrocatalysts with abundant elements for a wide spectrum of next&#8208;generation energy devices.</description>

                Abstract The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are cornerstone half reactions involved in many renewable energy technologies. High&#8208;density single&#8208;atom catalysts maximize the atom utilization and isolated active sites. Furthermore, introduction of pyri&#8208;N into the carbon&#8208;based nanostructures as an oxygen electrocatalyst creates an abundance of active sites. Here, an innovative strategy is reported based on atomic scale dispersion of Co atoms into the pyri&#8208;N enriched carbon nanotube encapsulated Ni nanoparticles grown on 3D electrospun carbon nanofiber nano&#8208;assemblies. Notably, the Co SA Ni&#8208;NCNT/CNF electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER and ORR activity in terms of low overpotentials and higher half&#8208;wave potentials. The atomically distributed Co allows the maximum exposure of active sites on the pyri&#8208;N dominated multidimensional carbon skeleton, and synergistic effects with Ni nanoparticles greatly reduced the delocalization around the metal centers and provided an ideal environment for interactions with oxygen intermediates, thus facilitating the 4e &#8722; pathway, as evidenced by the DFT calculations. Moreover, Zn&#8208;air batteries using a Co SA Ni&#8208;NCNT/CNF air cathode exhibited a high&#8208;power density and admirable specific capacity. This studies may provide an avenue for the rational modulation of single&#8208;atom catalysts and cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;scale synthesis of bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts for rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries and anion exchange membrane fuel cell.</description>

                Abstract Electrocatalytic water splitting has been identified as a potential candidate for producing clean hydrogen energy with zero carbon emission. However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction on the anode side of the water&#8208;splitting device significantly hinders its practical applications. Generally, the efficiency of oxygen evolution processes depends greatly on the availability of cost&#8208;effective catalysts with high activity and selectivity. In recent years, extensive theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that cobalt (Co)&#8208;based nanomaterials, especially low&#8208;dimensional Co&#8208;based nanomaterials with a huge specific surface area and abundant unsaturated active sites, have emerged as versatile electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions, and thus, great progress has been made in the rational design and synthesis of Co&#8208;based nanomaterials for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reactions. Considering the remarkable progress in this area, in this timely review, we highlight the most recent developments in Co&#8208;based nanomaterials relating to their dimensional control, defect regulation (conductivity), electronic structure regulation, and so forth. Furthermore, a brief conclusion about recent progress achieved in oxygen evolution on Co&#8208;based nanomaterials, as well as an outlook on future research challenges, is given.</description>

                The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a bottleneck in green hydrogen production owing to its slow reaction kinetics and low catalytic efficiencies of earth abundant electrocatalysts in the alkaline OER reaction. This study investigates the OER performance of hierarchically porous cobalt electrocatalysts synthesized using the dynamic hydrogen bubble templating (DHBT) method. Characterization studies revealed that electrocatalysts synthesized under optimized conditions using the DHBT method consisted of cobalt nanosheets, and hierarchical porosity with macropores distributed in a honeycomb network and mesopores distributed between cobalt nanosheets. Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies revealed the presence of Co(OH)2 as the predominant surface cobalt species while Raman studies revealed the presence of the cubic Co3O4 phase in the synthesized electrocatalysts. The best performing electrocatalyst required only 360 mV of overpotential to initiate a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, exhibited a Tafel slope of 37 mV dec&#8722;1, and stable OER activity over 24 h. The DHBT method offers a facile, low cost and rapid synthesis approach for preparation for highly efficient cobalt electrocatalysts.</description>

                The oxygen reduction process generating H2O2 in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) system is milder and environmentally friendly compared with the traditional anthraquinone process but still lacks the efficient electron-oxygen-proton coupling interfaces to improve H2O2 production efficiency. Here, we propose an integrated active site strategy, that is, designing a hydrophobic C&#8211;B&#8211;N interface to refine the dearth of electron, oxygen, and proton balance. Computational calculation results show a lower energy barrier for H2O2 production due to synergistic and coupling effects of boron sites for O2 adsorption, nitrogen sites for H+ binding, and the carbon structure for electron transfer, demonstrating theoretically the feasibility of the strategy. Furthermore, we construct a hydrophobic boron- and nitrogen-doped carbon black gas diffusion cathode (BN-CB-PTFE) with graphite carbon dots decorated on a BiVO4 photoanode (BVO/g-CDs) for H2O2 production. Remarkably, this approach achieves a record H2O2 production rate (9.24 &#956;mol min&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2) at the PEC cathode. The BN-CB-PTFE cathode exhibits an outstanding Faraday efficiency for H2O2 production of &#8764;100%. The newly formed h-BN integrative active site can not only adsorb more O2 but also significantly improve the electron and proton transfer. Unexpectedly, coupling BVO/g-CDs with the BN-CB-PTFE gas diffusion cathode also achieves a record H2O2 production rate (6.60 &#956;mol min&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2) at the PEC photoanode. This study opens new insight into integrative active sites for electron-O2-proton coupling in a PEC H2O2 production system that may be meaningful for environment and energy applications.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary Structural Reconstruction of Nanolaminated Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;FeC MAX Phase for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202401022</link>
      <description>Shaoping Zhu, Youbing Li, Minghui Yang, Huiyan Xu, Lijuan Cheng, Fei Fang, Qing Huang, Binwu Ying, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399125273

                Abstract Renewable energy technologies, such as water splitting, heavily depend on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nanolaminated ternary compounds, referred to as MAX phases, show great promise for creating efficient electrocatalysts for OER. However, their limited intrinsic oxidative resistance hinders the utilization of conductivity in M n+1 X n layers, leading to reduced activity. In this study, a method is proposed to improve the poor inoxidizability of MAX phases by carefully adjusting the elemental composition between M n+1 X n layers and single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick A layers. The resulting Ta 2 FeC catalyst demonstrates superior performance compared to conventional Fe/C&#8208;based catalysts with a remarkable record&#8208;low overpotential of 247 mV (@10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and sustained activity for over 240 h. Notably, during OER processing, the single&#8208;atom&#8208;thick Fe layer undergoes self&#8208;reconstruction and enrichment from the interior of the Ta 2 FeC MAX phase toward its surface, forming a Ta 2 FeC@Ta 2 C@FeOOH heterostructure. Through density functional theory (DFT) calculations, this study has found that the incorporation of Ta 2 FeC@Ta 2 C not only enhances the conductivity of FeOOH but also reduces the covalency of Fe&#9472;O bonds, thus alleviating the oxidation of Fe 3+ and O 2&#8722; . This implies that the Ta 2 FeC@Ta 2 C@FeOOH heterostructure experiences less lattice oxygen loss during the OER process compared to pure FeOOH, leading to significantly improved stability. These results highlight promising avenues for further exploration of MAX phases by strategically engineering M&#8208; and A&#8208;site engineering through multi&#8208;metal substitution, to develop M 2 AX@M 2 X@AOOH&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen evolution.</description>

                Obtaining hydrogen as a renewable fuel through water splitting is severely hindered by the energy-intensive oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Transition metal oxides based on low-cost and earth-abundant elements have been shown to provide high OER rivaling that of commercial IrO2, with nickel iron oxide/oxyhydroxide systems exhibiting some of the lowest reported overpotentials. Here, we report a nickel-iron oxalate material with a nanospike morphology synthesized via a simple and novel hydrothermal method, in which oxalate is generated in situ during material preparation under mild conditions. The as-synthesized nanostructured material displays high catalytic activity for OER, requiring a low overpotential of only 284 mV at a current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, lower than that of its amorphous counterpart and commercial IrO2 (326 and 308 mV, respectively). This material also exhibits excellent long-term stability with retention of the nanospike morphology after several hours under OER conditions.</description>

      <title>Design of Multifunctional Electrocatalysts for ORR/OER/HER/HOR: Janus Makes Difference</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202404000</link>
      <description>Xinyu Yang, Long Lin, Xiangyu Guo, Shengli Zhang, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399140360

                Abstract Multifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have broad application prospects; However, realization of such kinds of materials remain difficulties because it requires the materials to have not only unique electronic properties, but multiple active centers to deal with different reactions. Here, employing density functional theory (DFT) computations, it is demonstrated that by decorating the Janus&#8208;type 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) of TaSSe with the single atoms, the materials can achieve multifunctionality to catalyze the ORR/OER/HER/HOR. Out of sixteen catalytic systems, Pt&#8208;V S (i.e., Pt atom embedded in the sulfur vacancy), Pd&#8208;V Se , and Pt&#8208;V Se @TaSSe are promising multifunctional catalysts with superior stability. Among them, the Pt&#8208;V S @TaSSe catalyst exhibits the highest activity with theoretical overpotentials &#951; ORR = 0.40 V, &#951; OER = 0.39 V, and &#951; HER/HOR = 0.07 V, respectively, better than the traditional Pt (111), IrO 2 (110). The interplays between the catalyst and the reaction intermediate over the course of the reaction are then systematically investigated. Generally, this study presents a viable approach for the design and development of advanced multifunctional electrocatalysts. It enriches the application of Janus, a new 2D material, in electrochemical energy storage and conversion technology.</description>

      <title>Tuning Stainless Steel Oxide Layers through Potential Cycling&#9472;AEM Water Electrolysis Free of Critical Raw Materials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c01107</link>

                Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) have an intrinsic advantage over acidic proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers through their ability to use inexpensive, stable materials such as stainless steel (SS) to catalyze the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As such, the study of active oxide layers on SS has garnered great interest. Potential cycling is a means to create such active oxide layers in situ as they are readily formed in alkaline solutions when exposed to elevated potentials. Cycling conditions in the literature are rife with unexplained variations, and a complete account of how these variations affect the activity and constitution of SS oxide layers remains unreported, along with their influence on AEMWE performance. In this paper, we seek to fill this gap in the literature by strategically cycling SS felt (SSF) electrodes under different scan rates and ranges. The SSF anodes were rapidly activated within the first 50 cycles, as shown by the 10-fold decline in charge transfer resistance, and the subsequent 1000 cycles tuned the metal oxide surface composition. Cycling the Ni redox couple (RC) increases Ni content, which is further enhanced by lowering the cycling rate, while cycling the Fe RC increases Cr content. Fair OER activity was uncovered through cycling the Ni RC, while Fe cycling produced SSF electrodes active toward both the OER and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This indicates that inert SSF electrodes can be activated to become efficient OER and HER electrodes. To this effect, a single-cell AEMWE without any traditional catalyst or ionomer generated 1.0 A cm&#8211;2 at 1.94 V &#177; 13.3 mV with an SSF anode, showing a fair performance for a cell free of critical raw materials.</description>

                A coupled chemical looping conversion of glycerol and CO2 with thermochemical water splitting (WS) cycle is substantially researched due to its potential for one-step renewable H2 and syngas production. The major challenge lies on having good controls of redox reactions of the oxygen carriers (OCs) used and its unusual sensitivity to the changes of the compositions, chemical states and structure, etc. Here, we develop the OCs that consists of Fe2O3-Co3O4 supported on the mesoporous CeO2 structure (Fe2O3-Co3O4/CeO2), which simultaneously promote glycerol oxidization (GO), dry reforming of glycerol (GDR), and WS processes. The easy migration and activation of lattice oxygen by Fe2O3-Co3O4/CeO2 greatly improved the GO and GDR to produce syngas at the first step, and the pure H2 production by the reduced Fe2O3-Co3O4/CeO2 achieved excellent WS and oxygen storage at 750&#8451;. The low-content Fe dopant in the OC presented a beneficial effect on the anti-sintering performance, and increase of Co-doping indicated a high activity to WS as well as enhanced GDR. The Fe2O3-Co3O4/CeO2 with 7:5:10 of Co: Fe: Ce molar ratio presented the highest glycerol and CO2 conversions and the highest H2 yield, also illustrated the excellent activity and stability in 40 consecutive redox cycles.</description>

                Abstract Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) are promising for energy storage and conversion. However, the high charging voltage and low energy efficiency hinder their commercialization. Herein, we address these challenges by employing precisely constructed multifunctional Fe&#8208;Co diatomic site catalyst (FeCo&#8208;DACs) and integrating iodide/iodate redox into ZABs to create Zinc&#8208;air/iodide hybrid batteries (ZAIHBs) with highly efficient multifunctional catalyst. The strong coupling between the 3d orbitals of Fe and Co weakens the excessively strong binding strength between active sites and intermediates, enhancing the catalytic activities for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction and iodide/iodate redox. Consequently, FeCo&#8208;DACs exhibits outstanding bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity with a small potential gap (&#916;E = 0.66 V) and outstanding stability. Moreover, an outstanding catalytic performance towards iodide/iodate redox is obtained. Therefore, FeCo&#8208;DAC&#8208;based ZAIHBs exhibit high energy efficiency of up to 75% at 10 mA cm &#8208;2 and excellent cycling stability (72% after 500 hours). This research offers critical insights into the rational design of DACs, and paves the way for high&#8208;energy efficiency energy storage devices. This article is protected by copyright.

                The development of low-cost, high-performance oxygen electrocatalysts is of great significance for energy conversion and storage. As a potential substitute for precious metal electrocatalysts, the construction of efficient and cost-effective oxygen electrocatalysts is conducive to promoting the widespread application of zinc&#8211;air batteries. Herein, CoxNiyMOF nanoparticles encapsulated within a carbon matrix were synthesized and employed as cathode catalysts in zinc&#8211;air batteries. Co0.5Ni0.5MOF exhibits superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance and durability. The zinc&#8211;air battery assembled with Co0.5Ni0.5MOF as the air cathode exhibits a maximum power density of 138.6 mW&#183;cm&#8722;2. These improvements are mainly attributed to the optimized metal composition of the cobalt&#8211;nickel alloy, which increases the specific surface area of the material and optimizes its pore structure. Significantly, the optimization of the electronic structure and active sites within the material has led to amplified ORR/OER activity and better zinc&#8211;air battery performance. This study underscores the immense promise of Co0.5Ni0.5MOF catalysts as feasible substitutes for commercial Pt/C catalysts in zinc&#8211;air batteries.</description>

                [FeFe] hydrogenases demonstrate remarkable catalytic efficiency in hydrogen evolution and oxidation processes. However, susceptibility of enzymes to oxygen&#8208;induced degradation impedes their practical deployment in hydrogen&#8208;production devices and fuel cells. Recent investigations into the oxygen&#8208;stable (Hinact) state of the H&#8208;cluster revealed its inherent capacity to resist oxygen degradation. Herein, we present findings on Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208;bound [2Fe&#8208;2S] complexes, bearing relevance to the oxygen&#8208;stable state within a biological context. A characteristic attribute of these complexes is the terminal Cl&#8722;/SH&#8722; ligation to the iron bearing the CO bridge. Structural analysis of the t&#8208;Cl demonstrates a striking resemblance to the Hinact state of DdHydAB and CbA5H. The t&#8208;Cl/t&#8208;SH exhibit reversible oxidation, with both redox species, electronically, being the first biomimetic analogs to the Htrans and Hinact states. These complexes exhibit notable resistance against oxygen&#8208;induced decomposition, supporting the potential oxygen&#8208;resistant nature of the Htrans and Hinact states. The swift reductive release of the Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208; demonstrates its labile and kinetically controlled binding. The findings garnered from these investigations offer valuable insights into properties of the enzymatic O2&#8208;stable state, and key factors governing deactivation and reactivation conversion. This work contributes to advancement of bio&#8208;inspired molecular catalysts and integration of enzymes and artificial catalysts into H2&#8208;evolution devices and fuel&#8208;cell applications.</description>

                Compared to Ir, Ru&#8208;based catalysts often exhibited higher activity but suffered significant and rapid activity loss during the challenging oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in a corrosive acidic environment. Herein, we developed a hybrid MnRuOx catalyst in which the RuO2 microcrystalline regions serve as a supporting framework, and the amorphous MnRuOx phase fills the microcrystalline interstices. In particular, the MnRuOx&#8208;300 catalyst from an annealing temperature of 300oC contains an optimal amorphous/crystalline heterostructure, providing substantial defects and active sites, facilitating efficient adsorption and conversion of OH&#8208;. In addition, the heterostructure leads to a relative increase of the d&#8208;band center close to the Fermin level, thus accelerating electron transfer with reduced charge transfer resistance at the active interface between crystalline and amorphous phases during the OER. The catalyst was further thoroughly evaluated under various operating conditions and demonstrated exceptional activity and stability for the OER, representing a promising solution to replace Ir in water electrolyzers.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Investigations of Complex Electronic Interactions by Elemental Doping and Material Compositing of Cobalt Oxide for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202405384</link>
      <description>Jinzhen Huang, Adam H. Clark, Natasha Hales, Camelia N. Borca, Thomas Huthwelker, Radim Skoup&#253;, Thomas Schmidt, Emiliana Fabbri, Advanced functional materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399080117

                Abstract Doping and compositing are two universal design strategies used to engineer the electronic state of a material and mitigate its disadvantages. These two strategies are extensively applied to design efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting. Using cobalt oxide (CoO) as a model catalyst, it is proven that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance can be progressively improved, first by Fe&#8208;doping to form Fe&#8208;CoO solid solution, and further by the addition of CeO 2 to produce a Fe&#8208;CoO/CeO 2 composite. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals that distinct electronic interactions are induced by the processes of doping and compositing. Fe&#8208;doping of CoO can break down the structural symmetry, changing the electronic structure of both Co and O species at the surface and decreasing the flat&#8208;band potential (V fb ). In comparison, subsequent compositing of Fe&#8208;CoO with CeO 2 induces negligible electronic changes in the Fe&#8208;CoO (as seen in ex situ characterizations), but significantly modifies the oxidative transformations of both Co and Fe under OER conditions. The spectroscopic investigations reveal that Fe&#8208;doping and CeO 2 compositing play different roles in modifying the electronic properties of CoO in its pristine state and during OER catalysis, in return, providing useful guidance for the design of more efficient electrocatalysts using these two strategies.</description>

                The development of a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy economy encompasses efficient hydrogen production from renewable energy via electrolysis. In this context, great efforts have recently been dedicated to the development of more efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts. Understanding the mechanism of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on transition metal oxide catalysts is of great interest, but the reaction and system complexity render the characterization of active sites and the understanding of reaction mechanisms challenging. Time resolved Quick X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) can provide dynamic snapshots of the electronic and local structure of nanocatalysts, revealing the &#8216;real active phase&#8217; of the catalyst, which can substantially differ from the as-prepared catalyst powder or the catalyst in form of an electrode under non-operating conditions. In this contribution, several examples will be presented showing how operando XAS can reveal catalyst-support interactions, changes in the reaction mechanism, and dynamic reversible/irreversible changes in the electronic and local structure of OER catalysts.</description>

                Phosphorescence-based oxygen-sensing hydrogels are a promising platform technology for an upcoming generation of insertable biosensors that are smaller, softer, and potentially more biocompatible than earlier designs. However, much remains unknown about their long-term performance and biocompatibility in vivo. In this paper, we design and evaluate a range of hydrogel sensors that contain oxygen-sensitive phosphors stabilized by micro- and nanocarrier systems. These devices demonstrated consistently good performance and biocompatibility in young adult rats for over three months. This study thoroughly establishes the biocompatibility and long-term suitability of phosphorescence lifetime sensors in vivo, providing the groundwork for expansion of this platform technology into a family of small, unobtrusive biosensors for a range of clinically relevant metabolites.</description>

      <title>Cauliflower-Like Pd/Moc||Mo2c/C Heterostructure as an Efficient Trifunctional Catalyst for Formic Acid Oxidation, Hydrogen Evolution, and Oxygen Reduction Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4844553</link>
      <description>Ting Wang, Yuquan Feng, SU Jian-jun, Wei Qi, Xin Run, Jiannan Cai, Zhang Xiao-feng, Qiufeng Huang, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399109585

                Developing efficient Pd-based multi-functional catalytic materials for formic acid oxidation reaction (FAO), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains a significant challenge. Transition metal interstitial carbides (TMICs) have emerged as promising candidates for electrocatalysis due to their unique structure. Cauliflower-shaped Pd/MoC||Mo2C/C nanostructured heterogeneous composites were prepared using a high-temperature pyrolysis and ethanol reduction method. The resulting materials exhibit high electrocatalytic performance towards FAO, HER, and ORR. In terms of FAO, the mass activity of Pd/MoC||Mo2C/C is 1.87 A mgPd-1, which is 2.75 times higher than that of Pd/C (0.68 A mgPd-1). As for the HER, a much lower overpotential of -28 mV is required to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 compared to Pd/C(-40 mV). Fortunately, Pd/MoC||Mo2C/C also exhibits excellent ORR activity with a half-wave potential of 0.798 V and the maximum current density of approximately 5.73 mA cm-2 in alkaline electrolytes. The use of heterostructures enables the rearrangement of surface electrons, modifies active sites, and promotes the interaction between MoC||Mo2C/C and Pd. This leads to significant multifunctional catalytic performance. These findings could lead to the development of other noble metal-based materials loaded on intermetallic compounds with stable and effective electrocatalytic performance.</description>

                High-valent cobalt-oxides play a pivotal role in alternative energy technology as catalysts for water splitting and as cath-odes in lithium-ion batteries. Despite this importance, the properties governing the stability of high-valent cobalt-oxides, and specifically possible oxygen evolution pathways, are not clear. One root of this limited understanding is the scarcity of high-valent, Co(IV)-containing model complexes; there are no reports of stable, well-defined complexes with multiple Co(IV) centers. Here, an oxidatively robust fluorinated ligand scaffold enables the isolation and crystallographic charac-terization of a Co(IV)2-bis-&#956;-oxo complex. This complex is remarkably stable, in stark contrast with previously reported Co(IV)2 species which are highly reactive, which demonstrates that oxy-Co(IV)2 species are not necessarily unstable with respect to oxygen evolution. This example underscores a new design strategy for highly oxidizing transition metal frag-ments and provides detailed data on a previously inaccessible chemical unit of relevance to O&#8211;O bond formation and oxygen evolution.</description>

                Development of cheap, highly active, and durable nonprecious metal-based oxygen electrocatalysts is essential for metal-air battery technology, but achieving the balance of oxygen evolution reaction (OER)/oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) bifunctional performance and long-term durability is still a great challenge. Using a typical Co-N-C catalyst as a model, herein, we introduced ammonium chloride into nitrogen-doped carbon materials containing metal elements during the pyrolysis process (Co-N-C/AC), which not only increases the active area but also realizes the accurate customization of the active site (pyridine nitrogen and cobalt oxide species) so as to achieve the balance of the OER/ORR bifunctional sites. The synthesized Co-N-C/AC bifunctional catalyst with a three-dimensional porous structure exhibits a smaller potential gap of 0.72 V.

                Barium&#8211;cobaltate-based perovskite (BaCoO3&#8722;&#948;) and barium&#8211;cobaltate-based nanocomposites have been intensively studied in energy storage and conversion devices mainly due to flexible oxygen stoichiometry and tunable nonprecious transition metal oxidation states. Although a rich and complex family of structural polymorphs has already been reported for these perovskites in the literature, the potential structural evolution that may occur during the oxygen reduction reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction has not been investigated so far. In this study, we synthesized and characterized the lowest Co-oxidation state possible in the compound, BaCoO2, which exhibits a quartz-derived, trigonal structure with a helicoidally corner-sharing, CoO4-tetrahedral-framework as already proposed by Spitsbergen et al. Oxygen can reversibly be inserted in such a crystal structure to form BaCoO3&#8722;&#948;, i.e., with 0 &#8804; &#948; &#8804; 1, based on the results of an in situ coupled thermogravimetric - neutron diffraction study and which presents therefore giant oxygen capacity storage due to the extreme tunability of the electronic configuration of the cobalt cations which defines the fundamental origins of the materials performance. The reversible conversion of BaCoO2 to BaCoO3&#8722;&#948; associated with a similar electronic conductivity above 900 K permits to clarify the high potential of BaCoO3&#8722;&#948;-based energy storage and conversion devices.</description>

                Highly efficient and cost-effective electrocatalysts are of critical significance in the domain of water electrolysis. In this study, a Ni3N-CeO2/NF heterostructure is synthesized through a facile hydrothermal technique followed by a subsequent nitridation process. This catalyst is endowed with an abundance of oxygen vacancies, thereby conferring a richer array of active sites. Therefore, the catalyst demonstrates a markedly low overpotential of 350 mV for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) at 50 mA cm&#8722;2 and a low overpotential of 42 mV for the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Serving as a dual-function electrode, this electrocatalyst is employed in overall water splitting in alkaline environments, demonstrating impressive efficiency at a cell voltage of 1.52 V of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. The in situ Raman spectroscopic analysis demonstrates that cerium dioxide (CeO2) facilitates the rapid reconfiguration of oxygen vacancy-enriched nickel oxyhydroxide (NiOOH), thereby enhancing the OER performance. This investigation elucidates the catalytic role of CeO2 in augmenting the OER efficiency of nickel nitride (Ni3N) for water electrolysis, offering valuable insights for the design of high-performance bifunctional catalysts tailored for water splitting applications.</description>

Herein, a series of iron-cobalt bimetallic alloy heterojunctions are purposely designed and constructed via a newly developed controllable phase separation engineering strategy. The results show that the phase separation process and alloy component distribution rely on the metal molar ratio (Fe/Co), indicative of the metal content dependent behavior. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the electronic structure and charge distribution of iron-cobalt bimetallic alloy can be modulated and optimized, thus leading to the formation of an electron-rich interface layer, which likely tunes the</description>

                Abstract This work focuses on predicting and characterizing the electronic conductivity of spinel oxides, which are promising materials for energy storage devices and for the oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions due to their attractive properties and abundance of transition metals that can act as active sites for catalysis. To this end, a new database was developed from first principles, including band structure and conductivity properties of spinel oxides, and machine learning algorithms were trained on this database to predict electronic conductivity and band gaps based solely on the compositions. The models developed in this study are scaled from the quantum level up to a continuum conductivity model. The relatively small database used in this study allowed for accurate predictions of band gap and conductivity. By altering the composition of spinel oxides, the model was able to predict high conductivity for spinels with high nickel content and to match experimental trends for manganese cobalt spinels. The ability to predict material properties is especially important in energy conversion devices such as batteries and supercapacitors where redox reactions take place.</description>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting is a promising approach for sustainable hydrogen production. The design and development of efficient and stable bifunctional catalysts are the key to realizing hydrogen production from water splitting. Herein, we successfully synthesized bifunctional MoOx/CoMo grown on copper nanowires (Cu NWs) through an electrodeposition approach, showing excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances. The MoOx/CoMo/Cu NWs catalyst exhibited overpotentials as low as 56 mV and 211 mV to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for HER and OER in alkaline media, respectively. Moreover, the MoOx/CoMo/Cu NWs as bifunctional electrodes for overall water splitting achieved a low voltage of 1.45 and 1.62 V at 10 and 50 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively, with a stability of 10 h at 50 mA cm&#8208;2. This work provides a promising strategy for designing highly active catalysts that replace precious&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts on energy conversion.</description>

                Presented here is an electrochemical three-electrode Gas Diffusion Electrode (GDE) cell tailored for operandoand in situ investigations of electrocatalytic processes, with a particular focus on X-ray scattering studies. The optimized cell is engineered to accommodate the minimal sample-detector distances requisite for comprehensive X-ray total scattering investigations. An in-depth understanding of catalytic processes requires their study under &#8216;working&#8217; conditions. Configured as a flow-cell, the setup therefore enables the examination of electrocatalysts under high current densities and associated gas evolution phenomena, particularly pertinent for reactions like the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notably, its transparency simplifies cell alignment, troubleshooting, and facilitates scans through the catalyst layer, crucial for background corrections. Demonstrating its versatility, we showcase its utility through Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and X-ray Pair Distribution Function (PDF) analyses of total scattering data.</description>

                Front cover image: Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. In the article number CEY2432, Yuan et al. reported a ZIF-67-derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (denoted as HP-Au@CoxSy@ZIF-67) hybrid. The novel three-dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three-phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers. Meanwhile, the electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, wherein Au and NaBH4 reductant result in an interesting "competition effect" to regulate the relative ratio of Co2+/Co3+. Consequently, HP-Au@CoxSy@ZIF-67 displayed excellent OER performance, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery application.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical water splitting is a promising technique for the production of high&#8208;purity hydrogen. Substituting the slow anodic oxygen evolution reaction with an oxidation reaction that is thermodynamically more favorable enables the energy&#8208;efficient production of hydrogen. Moreover, this approach facilitates the degradation of environmental pollutants and synthesis of value&#8208;added chemicals through the rational selection of small molecules as substrates. Strategies for small&#8208;molecule selection and electrocatalyst design are critical to electrocatalytic performance, with a focus on achieving a high current density, selectivity, Faradaic efficiency, and operational durability. This perspective discusses the key factors required for further advancement, including technoeconomic analysis, new reactor system design, meeting the requirements of industrial applications, bridging the gap between fundamental research and practical applications, and product detection and separation. This perspective aims to advance the development of hybrid water electrolysis applications.</description>

                Abstract Background Catalyst synthesis plays a crucial role in advancing photo and electrocatalysis technologies for sustainable development. However, the traditional thermal radiation heating method suffers from the disadvantages of high energy consumption, low heat transfer efficiency, slow heating speed and long heating time, which leads to the inefficiency and cost increases in catalyst preparation. Aims The Joule&#8208;heating ultrafast synthesis method with rapid heating/quenching and shorter heating time has attracted much attention. Despite its potential, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews specifically addressing the synthesis of advanced photo and electrocatalysts via Joule&#8208;heating. Therefore, this review aims to help people quickly understand the advantages of Joule&#8208;heating in the synthesis of photo and electrocatalysts. Discussion Herein, we firstly introduce the principles and devices of Joule&#8208;heating, and then we discuss breakthroughs in defect modulation, heterojunction construction, single&#8208;atom catalysts, bimetallic alloy catalysts, high&#8208;entropy alloy catalysts and metastable catalysts achieved through Joule&#8208;heating technology. The diverse applications of these catalysts include hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction reactions, carbon dioxide reduction reactions, nitrogen reduction reaction and degradation of organic pollutants. Furthermore, this review provides a forward&#8208;looking perspective on future directions for employing Joule&#8208;heating methods in the field of photo and electrocatalysis research. Conclusion This review highlights the pivotal role played by Joule&#8208;heating techniques in advancing nanomaterial synthesis as well as developing sustainable high&#8208;performance catalyst systems.</description>

                New advances in creating effective and affordable copper-based catalysts for water splitting represent a promising strategy for driving sustainable energy technologies. However, ma- terials containing copper are susceptible to corrosion and agglomeration. In this study, we describe a synthesis route to produce olamine-functionalized CuO nanoparticles using the Hot Injection method. Nanoparticles were obtained and subsequently deposited on FTO substrates, undergoing thermal treatment at 500&amp;deg;C and 600&amp;deg;C in atmospheres containing O2 and N2, aiming to enhance the adhesion of the active material to the substrate and modify its oxidation state. Microstructural properties were analyzed using XRD, SEM, and TEM, while electrochemical properties were studied using CV, LSV, and EIS. Electrodes treated thermally in an N2 atmosphere at 600&amp;deg;C exhibited higher ESCA, indicating a greater area of active sites exposed to surface reactions and, therefore, superior catalytic activity in Hy- drogen Evolution Reaction (HER). These findings show an interesting strategy for avoiding rapid electron-hole recombination and, consequently, CuO corrosion. For Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), samples treated thermally in O2 atmosphere at 500&amp;deg;C and 600&amp;deg;C appear to be more effective.</description>

                Abstract The development of cathode materials with controllable physicochemical structures and explicit catalytic sites is important in rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs). Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have garnered increasing attention owing to their facile synthesis methods, ordered pore structure, and selectivity of functional groups. However, the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) inhibit their practical applications in ZABs. Herein, nucleophilic substitution is adopted to synthesize pyridine bi&#8208;triazine covalent organic framework (denoted as O&#8208;COF), and meanwhile, ionothermal conversion synthesis is employed to load MO x (M=Fe, Co) onto carbon nanosheet (named as FeCo@NC) to modulate the electronic structure. The Fe, Co&#8208;N codoped carbon material possesses a large portion of pyridinic N and M&#8208;N, high graphitization, and a larger BET surface area. An outstanding bifunctional activity has been exhibited in FeCo@NC, which provides a small voltage at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 for OER (E 10 = 1.67 V) and a remarkable half&#8208;wave voltage for ORR (E 1/2 = 0.86 V). More impressively, when assembling ZABs, it displays notable rate performance, significant specific capacity (783.9 mAh g Zn &#8722;1 ), and satisfactory long&#8208;term endurance. This method of regulating covalent organic framework and ionothermal synthesis can be extended to design diverse catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Recently, lead halide perovskites have emerged as promising photoanode materials for efficient hydrogen production. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and interfacial defect&#8208;mediated charge accumulation inevitably result in efficiency loss and degradation of perovskite photoanodes. Herein, a defect&#8208;passivated electron transport layer&#8208;based perovskite photoanode combined with a catalyst layer favorable is introduced for iodide oxidation reaction bearing a small thermodynamic barrier and rapid kinetics compared to OER for efficient solar fuel generation. The resulting perovskite photoanode revealed a saturated photocurrent density of 22.4 mA cm &#8722;2 at 0.3 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (V RHE ) with an impressive onset potential of &#8722;0.2 V RHE as well as durability for 225 h in a neutral electrolyte. In addition, an unbiased hydrogen&#8208;production device comprising a perovskite photoanode and Pt coil electrocatalyst is demonstrated, achieving a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 11.45% and stable operation for 25 h. Moreover, a wireless artificial leaf&#8208;structured device realizing solar&#8208;driven hydrogen generation in natural sea water under outdoor sunlight is presented.</description>

                Abstract A mixed Sulfur-doped zinc oxide-nickel oxide nanocomposite electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was prepared. By hydrothermal method, we prepared a high-efficiency OER electrocatalyst doped with zinc oxide and nickel oxide. By applying different characterizations, the material was proven to be a new phase of (S-doped-ZnO-NiO). S-doped ZnO-NiO, ZnO-NiO did not show excellent performance. At 10 mA cm&#8722; 2, the generation potential of OER is 1.45 V and that of HER is -0.04 V. This unique morphology results in better OER performance of 240 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722; 2 in the KOH electrolyte, and similarly, the S-doped ZnO-NiO shows us excellent long-term stability in alkaline media with a small Tafel slope (77 mV dec&#8722; 1). S-doped ZnO-NiO hybrid catalysts offer great potential for electrochemical devices due to their low cost and high activity. we have successfully constructed an electrocatalyst with the dual functions of HER and OER, which can achieve efficient water splitting.</description>

      <title>Advancements in water splitting for sustainable energy generation: A review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.24294/can.v7i1.5834</link>
      <description>Razu Shahazi, Amirul Islam Saddam, S.K. Majumdar, Md. Rakibul Islam, Mohammed M. Rahman, M. M. Alam, Ajoy Kumer, Giti Paimard, Characterization and application of nanomaterials. 7(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399244269

                Water splitting, the process of converting water into hydrogen and oxygen gases, has garnered significant attention as a promising avenue for sustainable energy production. One area of focus has been the development of efficient and cost-effective catalysts for water splitting. Researchers have explored catalysts based on abundant and inexpensive materials such as nickel, iron, and cobalt, which have demonstrated improved performance and stability. These catalysts show promise for large-scale implementation and offer potential for reducing the reliance on expensive and scarce materials. Another avenue of research involves photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells, which utilize solar energy to drive the water-splitting reaction. Scientists have been working on designing novel materials, including metal oxides and semiconductors, to enhance light absorption and charge separation properties. These advancements in PEC technology aim to maximize the conversion of sunlight into chemical energy. Inspired by natural photosynthesis, artificial photosynthesis approaches have also gained traction. By integrating light-absorbing materials, catalysts, and membranes, these systems aim to mimic the complex processes of natural photosynthesis and produce hydrogen fuel from water. The development of efficient and stable artificial photosynthesis systems holds promise for sustainable and clean energy production. Tandem cells, which combine multiple light-absorbing materials with different bandgaps, have emerged as a strategy to enhance the efficiency of water-splitting systems. By capturing a broader range of the solar spectrum, tandem cells optimize light absorption and improve overall system performance. Lastly, advancements in electrocatalysis have played a critical role in water splitting. Researchers have focused on developing advanced electrocatalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). These electrocatalysts contribute to overall water-splitting efficiency and pave the way for practical implementation.</description>

                The development of effective bifunctional electrode materials is necessary for worldwide adoption of large-scale hydrogen production by water electrolysis. Nickel hydroxide - based transition metal materials are among the most promising electrodes for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While Ni(OH)2 exists in two crystalline states, namely &#945;-Ni(OH)2 and &#946;-Ni(OH)2, neither can meet requirements for effective bifunctional electrode materials on their own, due to relatively low catalytic activity. In this study, bifunctional catalysts with &#945;-Ni(OH)2/&#946;-Ni(OH)2 interfaces, prepared using Fe, Co-induced hydrolysis, have been successfully applied for electrolytic water splitting. According to physical characterization, Fe3+ and Co2+ are incorporated into Ni(OH)2 layers, where Fe doping leads to the formation of a regular flake structure, while Co doping facilitates surface electron transfer, enhancing electrocatalytic activity towards HER and OER. Overpotentials of the obtained catalysts at 100 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 are as low as 224 mV for HER and 324 mV for OER. Both HER and OER overpotentials remained almost unchanged after 24 h operation at a high current density of 1 A&#183;cm&#8722;2, demonstrating excellent stability of the newly prepared materials during water electrolysis. The synthesis of &#945;-Ni(OH)2/&#946;-Ni(OH)2 interfaces is a new direction for the manufacturing of industrially applicable water splitting electrocatalysts suitable for high current density operation.</description>

      <title>In Situ Construction of Biphasic Boride Electrocatalysts on Dealloyed Bulk Ni&#8211;Mo Alloy as Self-Supporting Electrode for Water Splitting at High Current Density</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c04157</link>
      <description>Guangyao Yang, Weiliang Peng, Zhipeng Chen, Shaobo Li, Han Qin, Renzong Hu, Bin Yuan, ACS applied materials &amp; interfaces. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399050071

                Nickel&#8211;molybdenum&#8211;boron (Ni&#8211;Mo&#8211;B)-based catalysts with biphasic interfaces are highly advantageous in bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in alkaline water-splitting. However, it remains an ongoing challenge to obtain porous Ni&#8211;Mo alloy substrates that provide stable adhesion to catalysts, ensuring the long-term performance of bifunctional self-supporting electrodes at a high current density. Herein, a porous Ni&#8211;Mo alloy substrate was effectively obtained by a cost-effective dealloying process on a commercial Ni&#8211;Mo alloy with high-energy crystal planes. Subsequently, the Mo2NiB2/Ni3B bifunctional catalyst was in situ synthesized on this substrate via boriding heat treatment, resulting in outstanding catalytic activity and stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the abundant biphasic interfaces and surface-reconstructed sites of the Mo2NiB2/Ni3B catalyst can decrease the energy barriers for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Thus, the designed self-supporting electrodes show bifunctional catalytic activity with overpotentials of 151 mV for HER and 260 mV for OER at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2. Markedly, the assembled water electrolyzer can be driven up to 10 mA cm&#8211;2 at 1.64 V and maintain catalytic activity at a high current density of 1000 mA cm&#8211;2 for 100 h. The new strategy is expected to provide a low-cost scheme for designing self-supporting bifunctional electrodes with high activity and excellent stability and contribute to the development of hydrogen energy technology.</description>

      <title>Physiological and Proteome Analysis of the Effects of Chitosan Oligosaccharides on Salt Tolerance of Rice Seedlings</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms25115953</link>
      <description>Xiaohua Qian, Yaqing He, Lu Zhang, Xianzhen Li, Wei Tang, International journal of molecular sciences. 25(11)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399155713

                Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important social-economic crop, and rice seedlings are easily affected by salt stress. Chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) plays a positive role in promoting plant growth and development. To gain a better understanding of the salt tolerance mechanism of rice under the action of COS, Nipponbare rice seedlings were selected as the experimental materials, and the physiological and biochemical indexes of rice seedlings in three stages (normal growth, salt stress and recovery) were measured. Unlabelled quantitative proteomics technology was used to study differential protein and signaling pathways of rice seedlings under salt stress, and the mechanism of COS to improve rice tolerance to salt stress was elucidated. Results showed that after treatment with COS, the chlorophyll content of rice seedlings was 1.26 times higher than that of the blank group (CK). The root activity during the recovery stage was 1.46 times that of the CK group. The soluble sugar in root, stem and leaf increased by 53.42%, 77.10% and 9.37%, respectively. The total amino acid content increased by 77% during the stem recovery stage. Furthermore, the malondialdehyde content in root, stem and leaf increased by 21.28%, 26.67% and 32.69%, respectively. The activity of oxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and oxygenase (CAT) were increased. There were more differentially expressed proteins in the three parts of the experimental group than in the CK group. Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of these differentially expressed proteins revealed that the experimental group was enriched for more entries. Then, through the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), the top ten pathways enriched with differentially expressed proteins in the two groups (COS and CK groups) were utilized, and a detailed interpretation of the glycolysis and photosynthesis pathways was provided. Five key proteins, including phosphofructokinase, fructose bisphosphate aldolases, glycer-aldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, enolase and pyruvate kinase, were identified in the glycolysis pathway. In the photosynthesis pathway, oxygen evolution enhancement proteins, iron redox proteins and ferredoxin-NADPH reductase were the key proteins. The addition of COS led to an increase in the abundance of proteins, a response of rice seedlings to salt stress. COS helped rice seedlings resist salt stress. Furthermore, using COS as biopesticides and biofertilizers can effectively increase the utilization of saline-affected farmland, thereby contributing to the alleviating of the global food crisis.</description>

                [FeFe] hydrogenases demonstrate remarkable catalytic efficiency in hydrogen evolution and oxidation processes. However, susceptibility of enzymes to oxygen&#8208;induced degradation impedes their practical deployment in hydrogen&#8208;production devices and fuel cells. Recent investigations into the oxygen&#8208;stable (Hinact) state of the H&#8208;cluster revealed its inherent capacity to resist oxygen degradation. Herein, we present findings on Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208;bound [2Fe&#8208;2S] complexes, bearing relevance to the oxygen&#8208;stable state within a biological context. A characteristic attribute of these complexes is the terminal Cl&#8722;/SH&#8722; ligation to the iron bearing the CO bridge. Structural analysis of the t&#8208;Cl demonstrates a striking resemblance to the Hinact state of DdHydAB and CbA5H. The t&#8208;Cl/t&#8208;SH exhibit reversible oxidation, with both redox species, electronically, being the first biomimetic analogs to the Htrans and Hinact states. These complexes exhibit notable resistance against oxygen&#8208;induced decomposition, supporting the potential oxygen&#8208;resistant nature of the Htrans and Hinact states. The swift reductive release of the Cl&#8208;/SH&#8208; demonstrates its labile and kinetically controlled binding. The findings garnered from these investigations offer valuable insights into properties of the enzymatic O2&#8208;stable state, and key factors governing deactivation and reactivation conversion. This work contributes to advancement of bio&#8208;inspired molecular catalysts and integration of enzymes and artificial catalysts into H2&#8208;evolution devices and fuel&#8208;cell applications.</description>

                In humans and higher animals, a trade-off between a sufficiently high concentration of erythrocytes (hematocrit), to bind oxygen and sufficiently low blood viscosity to allow rapid blood flow has been achieved during evolution. The optimal value lies between the extreme cases of pure blood plasma, which cannot practically transport any oxygen, and 100\% hematocrit, which would imply very slow blood flow or none at all. As oxygen delivery to tissues is the main task of the cardiovascular system, it is reasonable to expect that maximum oxygen delivery has been achieved during evolution. Optimal hematocrit theory, based on this optimality principle, has been successful in predicting hematocrit values of about 0.3-0.5, which are indeed observed in humans and many animal species. Similarly, the theory can explain why higher than normal hematocrit, ranging from 0.5 to 0.7, can promote better exertional performance. Here we present a review of theoretical approaches to the calculation of the optimal hematocrit value under different conditions and discuss them in a broad physiological context. Several physiological and medical implications are outlined, e.g. in view of blood doping, temperature adaptation, and life at high altitudes.</description>

      <title>Widespread adaptive evolution in the photosystems of angiosperms provides new insight into the evolution of photosystem II repair.</title>

                Oxygenic photosynthesis generates the initial energy source which fuels nearly all life on earth. At the heart of the process are the photosystems, pigment binding multi-protein complexes that catalyse the first step of photochemical conversion of light energy into chemical energy. Here, we investigate the molecular evolution at single residue resolution of the plastid-encoded subunits of the photosystems across 773 angiosperm species. We show that despite an extremely high level of conservation, 7% of residues in the photosystems, spanning all photosystem subunits, exhibit hallmarks of adaptive evolution. Through in silico modelling of these adaptive substitutions we uncover the impact of these changes on the properties of the photosystems, focussing on their effects on co-factor binding and the formation of inter-subunit interfaces. We further reveal that evolution has repeatedly destabilised the interaction photosystem II and its D1 subunit, thereby reducing the energetic barrier for D1 turn-over and photosystem repair. Together, these results provide new insight into the trajectory of photosystem evolution during the radiation of the angiosperms.</description>

      <title>A path towards constraining the evolution of the interstellar medium and
  outflows in the Milky Way using APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stae1362</link>
      <description>Piyush Sharda, Yuan-Sen Ting, Neige Frankel, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399197727

                In recent years, the study of the Milky Way has significantly advanced due to extensive spectroscopic surveys of its stars, complemented by astroseismic and astrometric data. However, it remains disjoint from recent advancements in understanding the physics of the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). This paper introduces a new model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way that can be constrained on stellar data, because it combines a state-of-the-art ISM model with a Milky Way stellar disc model. Utilizing a dataset of red clump stars from APOGEE, known for their precise ages and metallicities, we concentrate on the last 6 billion years -- a period marked by Milky Way's secular evolution. We examine the oxygen abundance in the low-$\alpha$ disc stars relative to their ages and birth radii, validating or constraining critical ISM parameters that remain largely unexplored in extragalactic observations. The models that successfully reproduce the radius -- metallicity distribution and the age -- metallicity distribution of stars without violating existing ISM observations indicate a need for modest differential oxygen enrichment in Galactic outflows, meaning that the oxygen abundance of outflows is higher than the local ISM abundance, irrespective of outflow mass loading. The models also suggest somewhat elevated ISM gas velocity dispersion levels over the past 6 billion years compared to galaxies of similar mass. The extra turbulence necessary could result from energy from gas accretion onto the Galaxy, supernovae clustering in the ISM, or increased star formation efficiency per freefall time. This work provides a novel approach to constraining the Galactic ISM and outflows, leveraging the detailed insights available from contemporary Milky Way surveys.</description>

      <title>LinG3D: visualizing the spatio-temporal dynamics of clonal evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-024-05813-7</link>

                Abstract Background Cancers are spatially heterogenous, thus their clonal evolution, especially following anti-cancer treatments, depends on where the mutated cells are located within the tumor tissue. For example, cells exposed to different concentrations of drugs, such as cells located near the vessels in contrast to those residing far from the vasculature, can undergo a different evolutionary path. However, classical representations of cell lineage trees do not account for this spatial component of emerging cancer clones. Here, we propose routines to trace spatial and temporal clonal evolution in computer simulations of the tumor evolution models. Results The LinG3D (Lineage Graphs in 3D) is an open-source collection of routines (in MATLAB, Python, and R) that enables spatio-temporal visualization of clonal evolution in a two-dimensional tumor slice from computer simulations of the tumor evolution models. These routines draw traces of tumor clones in both time and space, and may include a projection of a selected microenvironmental factor, such as the drug or oxygen distribution within the tumor, if such a microenvironmental factor is used in the tumor evolution model. The utility of LinG3D has been demonstrated through examples of simulated tumors with different number of clones and, additionally, in experimental colony growth assay. Conclusions This routine package extends the classical lineage trees, that show cellular clone relationships in time, by adding the space component to show the locations of cellular clones within the 2D tumor tissue patch from computer simulations of tumor evolution models.</description>

                TiZrNbVAl lightweight high-entropy alloys (LHEAs) with body-centered cubic (BCC) structure have received extensive attention due to their low density and considerable mechanical properties. And the mechanical properties of these LHEAs can be further improved by adjusting the local chemical order (LCO). Here, we report a strategy for regulating LCOs in TiZrNbVAl LHEAs by adding oxygen. The results showed that the yield strength of LHEA increased from 787.8 MPa to 1029.5 MPa after oxygen addition. Moreover, the microstructure evolution proves that LCOs is conducive to promoting the transition of dislocation from plane slip, which is easy to produce stress concentration, to multistage slip, which improves the homogenizing deformation ability, and increasing the ductility from 12.8% to 20.9%, which is an increase of &#8764;63%. Our work provides a paradigm for achieving outstanding strength-ductility tradeoff in BCC-LHEAs via O doping.</description>

                Abstract Purpose Few studies have compared patient characteristics, clinical management, and outcome of patients with COVID-19 between the different epidemic waves. In this study, we describe patient characteristics, treatment, and outcome of patients admitted for COVID-19 in the Antwerp University Hospital over the first three epidemic waves of 2020&#8211;2021. Methods Retrospective observational study of COVID-19 patients in a Belgian tertiary referral hospital. All adult patients with COVID-19, hospitalized between February 29, 2020, and June 30, 2021, were included. Standardized routine medical data was collected from patient records. Risk factors were assessed with multivariable logistic regression. Results We included 722 patients, during the first ( n = 179), second ( n = 347) and third ( n = 194) wave. We observed the lowest disease severity at admission during the first wave, and more elderly and comorbid patients during the second wave. Throughout the subsequent waves we observed an increasing use of corticosteroids and high-flow oxygen therapy. In spite of increasing number of complications throughout the subsequent waves, mortality decreased each wave (16.6%,15.6% 11.9% in 1st, 2nd and 3rd wave respectively). C-reactive protein above 150 mg/L was predictive for the need for intensive care unit admission (odds ratio (OR) 3.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.32&#8211;6.15). A Charlson comorbidity index &#8805; 5 (OR 5.68, 95% CI 2.54&#8211;12.70) and interhospital transfers (OR 3.78, 95% CI 2.05&#8211;6.98) were associated with a higher mortality. Conclusions We observed a reduction in mortality each wave, despite increasing comorbidity. Evolutions in patient management such as high-flow oxygen therapy on regular wards and corticosteroid use may explain this favorable evolution.</description>

      <title>Thermal and chemical expansion of layered oxygen-deficient double perovskites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.29235/1561-8331-2024-60-2-95-104</link>

                Layered oxygen-deficient double perovskites (ODP) based on the rare-earth elements (REE), barium and 3 d -metals (Fe, Co, Cu etc.) are characterized by high values of electrical conductivity and high electrochemical activity in oxygen reduction reaction, and are considered as prospective cathode materials for intermediate-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) on the base of proton- and oxygen-ion conducting solid electrolytes (SE). Effective cathode materials should be thermomechanically compatible with materials of SE, which t&#1072;kes place when the values of their thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) are close to each other. Due to this the study of thermal expansion of ODP as well as the isotation of different contributions in it (thermal, chemical, spin etc.), is of considerable interest. In this work using dilatometric method the thermal expansion of NdBa 1&#8211;x SrxFeCo 0,5 Cu0,5O 6&#8722;&#948; (0.0 &#8804; &#1093; &#8804; 1.0) (NBSFCC) ODP was studied using dilatometric method. It was established that the values of average linear thermal expansion coefficient (LTEC) (&#945;) of the samples sharply increased from (15.1&#8211;16.2) &#183; 10 &#8211;6 K &#8211;1 at &#1058; &lt; 630&#8211;920 K to (18.9&#8211;23.5) 10 &#8211;6 K &#8211;1 at &#1058; &gt; 630&#8211;920 K due to the evolution of weaklybonded oxygen from the samples. Values of &#945; in the low-temperature region increase with increasing of values of their oxygen nonstoichiometry index (&#948;), and in the high-temperature one increase with the x increasing due to the increment of chemical contribution in the samples expansion. Based of the results of dilatometry, thermogravimetry, and iodometry, the thermal and chemical contributions in the expansion &#1086;n NBSFCC were isolated, and the effect of crystal structure, cationic and anionic composition of NBSFCC ODP on the values of their thermal and linear chemical expansion coefficient (LCEC, &#945; &#948; ) was investigated. It was found, that LCEC values of the samples sharply increased from (8.6&#8211;11.8) &#183; 10 &#8211;3 at (&#1093; &lt; 0.5) to (12.6&#8211;15.8) &#183; 10 &#8211;3 at (&#1093; &gt; 0.5) when transition from ordered tetragonal (&#1093; &lt; 0.5) to disordered cubic (&#1093; &gt; 0.5) phase took place. It was shown, that dependences of LTEC and LCEC of NBSFCC phases on their crystal structure and chemical compositions obtained in this work are in good accordance with the analogous dependences determined earlier for the ODP of other types.</description>

                Abstract The strong potential of platinum single atom (Pt SA ) in gas sensor technology is primarily attributed to its high atomic economy. Nevertheless, it is imperative to conduct further exploration to understand the impact of Pt SA on the active sites. In this study, the evolution of Pt SA on (100)CeO 2 and (111)CeO 2 is examined, revealing notable disparities in the position and activity of surface Pt SA on different crystal planes. The Pt SA in (100)CeO 2 surface can enhance the stability of Ce 3+ and construct a frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) to form a double active site by combining the steric hindrance effect of oxygen vacancies, which increases the response value from 1.8 to 27 and reduce the response&#8208;recovery time from 140&#8211;192 s to 25&#8211;26 s toward five ppm NO 2 at room temperature. Conversely, Pt SA tends to bind to terminal oxygen on the surface of (111)CeO 2 and become an independent reaction site. The response value of Pt SA &#8208;(111)CeO 2 surface only increased from 1.6 to 3.8. This research underscores the correlation between single atoms and crystal plane effects, laying the groundwork for designing and synthesizing ultra&#8208;stable and efficient gas sensors.</description>

                Abstract Light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O 2 batteries exhibit a high round&#8208;trip efficiency attributable to the assistance of light&#8208;generated electrons and holes in oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. Nonetheless, the excitonic effect arising from Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes impedes carrier separation, thus hindering efficient utilization of photo&#8208;energy. Herein, porphyrinic metal&#8208;organic frameworks with (Fe 2 Ni)O(COO) 6 clusters were used as photocathodes to accelerate exciton dissociation into charge carriers for light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O 2 batteries. The coupling of Ni 3d and Fe 3d orbitals boosts ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal cluster charge transfer, and hence drives exciton dissociation and activates O 2 for superoxide ( &#8226; O 2 &#8722; ) radicals, rather than singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ) under photoexcitation. These enable the light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O 2 batteries with a low total overvoltage of 0.28 V and round&#8208;trip efficiency of 92% under light irradiation of 100 mW cm &#8722;2 . This work highlights the excitonic effect in photoelectrochemical processes and provides insights into photocathode design for light&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O 2 batteries.

      <title>Magmatic and hydrothermal evolution of the superlarge Dashui goldfield in the West Qinling Orogen, China</title>

                Gold (Au) is a precious metal that has played an important role in the development of the global economy. It is therefore important to better define the genesis of Au mineralisation as an aid to focus exploration as the consumption of Au increases. The Dashui goldfield contains a super large Au resource of over 120 t (tonnes) in the West Qinling Orogen, central China. Despite several studies have focused on the genesis of the Dashui goldfield, the original physico&#8211;chemical natures of the magmatic and hydrothermal evolution remain unclear. Biotite and apatite in the mineralised diorite porphyry in the goldfield are sensitive to the changes in the physico&#8211;chemical conditions and the evolution of magmatic and hydrothermal fluids, and thus provide important keys to address these issues. Hence, we conducted detailed in&#8211;situ major and trace element studies of biotite and apatite from the ore&#8211;bearing diorite porphyry in the Dashui goldfield. Our aim is to elucidate the physico&#8211;chemical conditions, magma source, and the magmatic and hydrothermal evolution processes during the deposition of the gold, and to enhance the understanding of the Au genesis in the West Qinling Au province. Using the geochemistry of magmatic apatite, and magmatic and hydrothermal biotite, we have found that the crystallisation temperature and pressure along with emplacement depth of diorite porphyry were constrained at &#8764; 737&#8211;791 &#176;C, 1.08&#8211;1.73 kbar, and 3.94&#8211;6.30 km. The diorite porphyry has the geochemical affinities with calcium alkaline orogenic suites derived from a mixed crustal and mantle source. During the early emplacement of the diorite porphyry, the melt had a high oxygen fugacity and was highly enriched in Au. During the late magma crystallisation of the diorite porphyry, the magma was enriched continuously in most elements with the Ba/Rb ratios in the biotite varying from 10 to 5, and most of the Au was hosted by pyrite. Additionally, elements were continuously dissolved into fluids generating Cl&#8211;rich hydrothermal fluids during the evolution of the magma. During hydrothermal evolution, Au is migrated with As and Sb in the vapour phases of fluids, whereas Au migrated with Cl in the liquid phase. When temperatures dropped to &#8764; 200&#8211;400 &#176;C, Au started to combine with S and Si in the liquid phase of fluids. Subsequently, hydrothermal fluids interacted with host carbonate to form the Dashui goldfield, the Au during this stage was also transported and hosted in magnetite, hematite, and quartz within the carbonate rocks.</description>

      <title>A Highly Reversible Sn&#8208;Air Battery Possessing the Ultra&#8208;Low Charging Potential with the Assistance of Light</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202407856</link>
      <description>Mingze Gao, Ruiya Wang, Xinxin L&#252;, Yanchen Fan, Ziyang Guo, Yonggang Wang, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399011189

                Aqueous Sn&#8208;air batteries are attracting a great deal of interest in recent years due to the ultra&#8208;high safety, low cost, dendrite&#8208;free and highly reversible Sn anode. However, the slurry oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics on the air cathodes seriously affect the Sn&#8208;air battery performances. Although various advanced catalysts have been developed, the charge overpotentials (~1000 mV) of these Sn&#8208;air batteries are still not satisfactory. Herein, iron oxide (Fe2O3) modified titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanorods with heterogeneous structure are firstly synthesized on Ti mesh (Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti), and the obtained Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti is further applied as catalytic electrodes for Sn&#8208;air batteries. The core&#8208;shell heterogeneous structure of Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can effectively facilitate the conversion of electrochemical intermediates and separation of photo&#8208;excited electrons and holes to active oxygen&#8208;related reaction processes. DFT and experimental results also confirm that Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti can not only act as the electrocatalysts to improve ORR/OER properties, but also exhibit the superior photo&#8208;catalytic activity to promote charge kinetics. Hence, the Fe2O3@TiO2/Ti&#8208;based Sn&#8208;air batteries show ultra&#8208;low overpotential of ~40 mV, excellent rate capability and good cycling stability under light irradiation.

      <title>Arousal as a universal embedding for spatiotemporal brain dynamics</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.52843/cassyni.njvyzq</link>
      <description>Ryan V. Raut, No host. None(None)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4399071520

                Neural activity in awake organisms shows widespread and spatiotemporally diverse correlations with behavioral and physiological measurements. We propose that this covariation reflects in part the dynamics of a unified, arousal-related process that regulates brain-wide physiology on the timescale of seconds. Taken together with theoretical foundations in dynamical systems, this interpretation leads us to a surprising prediction: that a single, scalar measurement of arousal (e.g., pupil diameter) should suffice to reconstruct the continuous evolution of multimodal, spatiotemporal measurements of large-scale brain physiology. To test this hypothesis, we perform multimodal, cortex-wide optical imaging and behavioral monitoring in awake mice. We demonstrate that spatiotemporal measurements of neuronal calcium, metabolism, and blood-oxygen can be accurately and parsimoniously modeled from a low-dimensional state-space reconstructed from the time history of pupil diameter. Extending this framework to behavioral and electrophysiological measurements from the Allen Brain Observatory, we demonstrate the ability to integrate diverse experimental data into a unified generative model via mappings from an intrinsic arousal manifold. Our results support the hypothesis that spontaneous, spatially structured fluctuations in brain-wide physiology&#8212;widely interpreted to reflect regionally-specific neural communication&#8212;are in large part reflections of an arousal-related process. This enriched view of arousal dynamics has broad implications for interpreting observations of brain, body, and behavior as measured across modalities, contexts, and scales.</description>

      <title>The Catalytic Activity of Magnetic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/magnetochemistry10060040</link>
      <description>Ian Shuttleworth, Magnetochemistry. 10(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399073281

                High-performance catalysts for the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions (ORR and HER, respectively) are highly sought-after, particularly with the commitment of numerous agencies to the removal of conventional gas vehicles in the next few decades. Surprisingly little focus has been placed on the development of magnetic models to describe these systems. The current work will review the current understanding of surface heterogeneous catalysis across select magnetic surfaces, with attention focused on studies involving extended surfaces, which inherently are more accessible to fundamental analysis than the more applied nanoparticle systems. However, even the most up-to-date magnetic variants of this theory have focused on the tight binding limit of the d-band model. In this limit, the reactivity of the surface is governed by the position of the center of the d-band, and the model does not account for the higher moments of the d-band, such as the width, asymmetry, and modality. A summary of the theory supporting this analysis will be presented, along with a summary of the current literature on this level of analysis. The review will then conclude with a discussion of suggested directions for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Direct estimates of nitrogen abundance for Seyfert 2 nuclei</title>

                We derive the nitrogen and oxygen abundances in the Narrow Line Regions (NLRs) of a sample of 38 local ($z \: &lt; \: 0.4$) Seyfert~2 nuclei. For that, we consider narrow optical emission line intensities and direct estimates of the electron temperatures ($T_{\rm e}$-method). We find nitrogen abundances in the range $7.6 \: &lt; \: \rm 12+log(N/H) \: &lt; \: 8.6$ (mean value $8.06\pm0.22$) or $\rm 0.4 \: &lt; \: (N/N_{\odot}) \: &lt; 4.7$, in the metallicity regime $8.3 \: &lt; \: \rm 12+log(O/H) \: &lt; \: 9.0$. Our results indicate that the dispersion in N/H abundance for a fixed O/H value in AGNs is in agreement with that for disc \ion{H}{ii} regions with similar metallicity. We show that Seyfert~2 nuclei follow a similar (N/O)-(O/H) relation to the one followed by star-forming objects. Finally, we find that active galaxies called as 'nitrogen-loud' observed at very high redshift ($z \: &gt; \: 5$) show N/O values in consonance with those derived for local NLRs. This result indicates that the main star-formation event is completed in the early evolution stages of active galaxies.</description>

                Dispersion of single atoms (SAs) in the host is important for optimizing catalytic activity. Herein, we propose a novel strategy to tune oxygen vacancies in CeO2&#8208;X directionally anchoring the single atom platinum (PtSA), which is uniformly dispersed on the rGO. The catalyst's performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) can be enhanced by controlling different densities of CeO2&#8208;X in rGO. The PtSA performs best optimally densified and loaded on homogeneous and moderately densified CeO2&#8208;X/rGO (PtSA&#8208;M&#8208;CeO2&#8208;X/rGO). It exhibited high activity in HER with an overpotential of 25 mV at 0.5 M H2SO4 and 33 mV at 1 KOH than that of almost reported electrocatalysts. Furthermore, it exhibited stability for 90 hours at &#8722;100 mA cm&#8722;2 in 1 KOH and &#8722;150 mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 conditions, respectively. Through comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations, the suitable dispersion density of PtSA on the defects of CeO2&#8208;X with more active sites gives the potential for practical applications. This research paves the way for developing single&#8208;atom catalysts with exceptional catalytic activity and stability, holding promise in advanced green energy conversion through defects engineering.</description>

                Abstract The study describes the anatomy vertebrae of Common Carp (Cyprinus carpio; Linnaeus, 1758) using 3D micro-CT and Semiquantitative Elemental Microanalysis (EDX), which helps to understand the ontogeny and factors that determine the biomechanics of bones in wild fish. The study of Common carp vertebrae revealed a complex and heterogeneous structure, with a variety of components contributing to their function and stability. The vertebral bodies were composed of lamellar trabeculae and internal hollow spaces, while the neural and hemal arches were composed of bony trabeculae and connected by a lace-like structure. The results of EDX analysis demonstrated the presence of oxygen, nitrogen, sodium, carbon, magnesium, and chlorine, among others. The calcium to phosphorus ratio was within the ranges described in teleost, suggesting good bone health. The presence of magnesium, sodium, potassium, chlorine, and nitrogen is due to their essential role in different biological processes. In addition, a difference was observed between the trabeculae present in the vertebrae of the abdominal and caudal segments, suggesting a relationship between the density of each bone and its function. These findings contribute to the understanding of the structure and function of vertebrae in wild Common carp and may have implications for understanding the evolution of the vertebral column in fish in general.</description>

      <title>An earliest Ediacaran oxygenation episode in the Wilpena Group, Adelaide Superbasin, South Australia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.precamres.2024.107433</link>
      <description>Kelsey G. Lamothe, Malcolm W. Wallace, Ashleigh v.S. Hood, Catherine Rose, Precambrian research. 409(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399149629

                The first appearance of animals during the Ediacaran is arguably related to an increase in oceanic oxygenation during this time. However, there is considerable ambiguity in the global record of Ediacaran oxygenation, making it difficult to assess the potential links between oxygen and metazoan evolution. Here, we examine the earliest Ediacaran Nuccaleena Formation cap dolomite and basal Brachina Formation of the Adelaide Superbasin, South Australia, to determine the redox landscape in which these units were deposited. Red shales are present at the base of the Brachina Formation (lower Moolooloo Siltstone Member) over much of the Adelaide Superbasin but these transition laterally into green shales in the north, correlating with a facies transition into a deeper water setting. Fibrous dolomite cements within sheet cavities of the Nuccaleena Formation cap dolomite display evidence of a primary marine origin. Cathodoluminescence microscopy and laser ablation ICP-MS trace element analysis of these marine dolomite cements indicates a transition from an oxic environment in the south (with low Fe, Mn, and a Ce anomaly) to an anoxic (ferruginous) setting in the north (with high Fe, Mn and no Ce anomaly). This cap carbonate trace element geochemistry is spatially consistent with the overlying red to green shale transition in the basal Brachina Formation. Together, these data suggest the existence of a deep-water chemocline in this basin, separating an oxic upper water column from a ferruginous deeper water mass. This oxic interval directly post-dates the end-Cryogenian Marinoan Glaciation and is synchronous with an earliest Ediacaran oxygenation event previously described from South China. This evidence from the Adelaide Superbasin provides direct evidence for an earliest Ediacaran oxic water mass penetrating to a substantial paleodepth. The synchronous development of oxic intervals in both Australia and South China supports the notion of a globally developed oceanic oxygenation event and is consistent with the hypothesis that Ediacaran continental margin settings were periodically bathed in oxic water, conducive to the evolution of metazoans.</description>

      <title>Molecular and Evolution In Silico Studies Unlock the h4-HPPD C-Terminal Tail Gating Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines12061196</link>
      <description>Alfonso Trezza, Ancuta Birgauan, Michela Geminiani, Anna Visibelli, Annalisa Santucci, Biomedicines. 12(6)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399105635

                The enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (4-HPPD) is involved in the catabolism of the amino acid tyrosine in organisms such as bacteria, plants, and animals. It catalyzes the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to a homogenisate in the presence of molecular oxygen and Fe(II) as a cofactor. This enzyme represents a key step in the biosynthesis of important compounds, and its activity deficiency leads to severe, rare autosomal recessive disorders, like tyrosinemia type III and hawkinsinuria, for which no cure is currently available. The 4-HPPD C-terminal tail plays a crucial role in the enzyme catalysis/gating mechanism, ensuring the integrity of the active site for catalysis through fine regulation of the C-terminal tail conformation. However, despite growing interest in the 4-HPPD catalytic mechanism and structure, the gating mechanism remains unclear. Furthermore, the absence of the whole 3D structure makes the bioinformatic approach the only possible study to define the enzyme structure/molecular mechanism. Here, wild-type 4-HPPD and its mutants were deeply dissected by applying a comprehensive bioinformatics/evolution study, and we showed for the first time the entire molecular mechanism and regulation of the enzyme gating process, proposing the full-length 3D structure of human 4-HPPD and two novel key residues involved in the 4-HPPD C-terminal tail conformational change.</description>

      <title>Phase Engineering and Dispersion Stabilization of Cobalt toward Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202310499</link>
      <description>Chao Zhang, Yihang Luo, Nianqing Fu, Songlin Mu, Jihua Peng, Yan Liu, Guoge Zhang, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399069290

                Abstract Phase engineering is promising to increase the intrinsic activity of the catalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, the polymorphism interface is unstable due to the presence of metastable phases. Herein, phase engineering and dispersion stabilization are applied simultaneously to boost the HER activity of cobalt without sacrificing the stability. A fast and facile approach (plasma cathodic electro deposition) is developed to prepare cobalt film with a hetero&#8208;phase structure. The polymorphs of cobalt are realized through reduced stacking fault energy due to the doping of Mo, and the high temperature treatment resulted from the plasma discharge. Meanwhile, homogeneously dispersed oxide/carbide nanoparticles are produced from the reaction of plasma&#8208;induced oxygen/carbon atoms with electro&#8208;deposited metal. The existence of rich polymorphism interface and oxide/carbide help to facilitate H 2 production by the tuning of electronic structure and the increase of active sites. Furthermore, oxide/carbide dispersoid effectively prevents the phase transition through a pinning effect on the grain boundary. As&#8208;prepared Co&#8208;hybrid/CoO_MoC exhibits both high HER activity and robust stability (44 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , Tafel slope of 53.2 mV dec &#8722;1 , no degradation after 100 h test). The work reported here provides an alternate approach to the design of advanced HER catalysts for real application.</description>

                Abstract Microbes inhabiting and evolving in aquatic ecosystems at the base of polar ice sheets subsist under energy-limited conditions while in relative isolation from surface gene pools and their common ancestral populations of origin. Samples recently obtained from the base of West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) allowed us to examine evolutionary relationships of and identify metabolic pathways in microbial genomes recovered from the Mercer Subglacial Lake (SLM) ecosystem. We obtained 1,374 single-cell amplified genomes from individual bacterial and archaeal cells that were isolated from samples of SLM&#8217;s water column and sediments. Genome-based taxonomic classification coherently identified nearly all of the subglacial microorganisms as new species or novel taxonomic groups, and phylogenomic analyses showed evidence for genetically isolation of the microbial populations from marine and surface biomes. Comparative genomic analysis revealed a lake ecosystem exhibiting a range of metabolisms to oxidize various organic and inorganic compounds via aerobic or anerobic respiration. Network construction identified two distinct organotrophic and chemolithotrophic metabolic guilds that may operate alternatively depending on oxygen availability. Our SAG data imply substantial metabolic flexibility in the microbial assemblage characterized, reveal key energy generating strategies in the subglacial ecosystem, and provide a framework to assess microbial evolution beneath WAIS.</description>

      <title>The ore-forming fluid evolution of the Yechangping Mo-W deposit, Qinling Orogen: A case study of the Dabie-type porphyry system</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oregeorev.2024.106101</link>

                Dabie-type porphyry Mo deposits have recently emerged as a distinct subtype of porphyry Mo deposits, but questions remain about the magmatic-hydrothermal fluid evolution in the formation of this type deposit. Here, well-developed fluid inclusions in quartz phenocrysts, unidirectional solidification textures (UST) and quartz veins in the Yechangping porphyry Mo-W deposit, Qinling Orogen, completely record the magmatic-hydrothermal mineralization process. The characteristics and evolution of the ore-forming fluid in this deposit are investigated through petrography, microthermometry, and laser Raman spectroscopy analysis of fluid inclusions at different stages in order to improve our understanding of the fluid evolution in the genesis of Dabie-type porphyry Mo deposit. The mineralization process in the porphyry-type orebody can be divided into three periods and five stages: (1) magmatic period, including quartz phenocrysts (stage 1); (2) magmatic-hydrothermal transition period, including UST (stage 2); (3) hydrothermal period, including quartz &#177; K-feldspar veins (stage 3), quartz-molybdenite veins (stage 4), and calcite &#177; quartz veins (stage 5), where stage 4 is the main ore-forming stage. The fluid inclusions in quartz and calcite can be recognized as pure CO2 (PC type), CO2-H2O (C type), daughter minerals-bearing (S type), and H2O (WV type and WL type) inclusions. Ore-forming fluid is initially high temperature, high salinity, and CO2-rich, belonging to the H2O-CO2-NaCl (&#177;KCl) system suggested by the fluid inclusions identified in UST. The estimated lithostatic pressures of stage 1 range from 284&#8211;362 MPa, corresponding to depths of 10.3 to 13.2 km, which are consistent with the formation depth of the underlying magma chamber. The presence of UST in stage 2 indicates that the magma was saturated with fluid. Due to the fluctuating pressure (123&#8211;260 MPa) in UST of stage 2, fluid immiscibility happened soon after the fluid exsolution and is inferred to occur between the CO2-rich and aqueous phases. Then, the fluid boiling and mixing occurred in stages 3 and 4, respectively. The estimated pressures of stage 4 which represent the main mineralization stage range from 45&#8211;175 MPa, corresponding to depths of 4.6&#8211;6.4 km. The immiscibility of CO2, along with the fluid mixing-induced cooling and dilution, caused an increase in pH and a decrease in oxygen fugacity, which serves as a crucial mechanism for Mo mineralization at the Yechangping deposit. Stage 5 is characterized by low temperature (185&#8211;309 &#176;C) and low salinity (2.9&#8211;8.7 wt% NaCl equiv.). The primary high temperature, high salinity, CO2-rich fluids, and relatively deep ore-forming depth suggest that the Yechangping deposit is a typical example of Dabie-type porphyry deposits. The characteristics of fluids and the variation in estimated depth at each stage record the evolutionary process of a magmatic-hydrothermal system extending to depths of nearly 10 km in the Yechangping deposit.</description>

      <title>Evolution of oxide inclusions and cleanliness control in Al-killed GCr15SiMn bearing steel during secondary refining process</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/03019233231222113</link>
      <description>Guolei Zhang, Guoguang Cheng, Tao&#65533; Zhang, Hongsheng Miao, Zhong Xu, Ironmaking &amp; steelmaking. 51(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399057676

                The evolution of oxide inclusions and cleanliness control in Al-killed GCr15SiMn bearing steel was investigated using a combination of industrial tests and thermodynamic calculations during the secondary refining process. Three different refining conditions were employed in the LF process. With varying ranges of slag basicity (about 5.6&#8211;5.7, 4.8&#8211;4.9 and 3.9&#8211;4.3) and Al content (0.028&#8211;0.035 mass%, 0.023&#8211;0.025 mass% and 0.014&#8211;0.02 mass%), the total oxygen content in the steel after VD refining was measured as 0.0019 mass%, 0.0017 mass% and 0.0008 mass%, respectively. Throughout the refining process, the inclusions underwent a transformation from MgO-Al 2 O 3 (or Al 2 O 3 ) into CaO-Al 2 O 3 (-MgO), and eventually to CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 inclusions. Furthermore, it was observed that under high Al content and slag basicity refining conditions, a significant number of inclusions in VD treatment were formed and transformed into CaO&#183;Al 2 O 3 &#183;SiO 2 inclusions enriched with 60 mass% CaO. This indicated that when the proportion of CaO in calcium aluminates exceeded 45 mass%, there was an increased risk of larger-sized inclusions. Conversely, refining conditions with a slag basicity of 3.9&#8211;4.3 and an Al content of 0.014&#8211;0.02 mass% demonstrated effective inclusion control, resulting in lower number density, smaller sizes within 10 &#956;m and an average composition located in the liquid region. This study carries important practical significance for the smelting of high cleanliness GCr15SiMn bearing steel.</description>

                Photocatalytic technology has emerged as a promising approach for addressing global energy and environmental challenges by enabling the conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals. In this study, we successfully synthesized TiO2 co-doped with C and N, along with an abundant oxygen vacancy (referred to as C/N-TiO2-VO), utilizing a hydrothermal method. Through various characterization techniques, it has been confirmed that the C and N originated from N, N'-dimethylformamide (DMF), while the VO was mainly generated by isopropyl alcohol (IPA), acting as a reducing agent. These techniques also verified that C/N-TiO2-VO has the strong light absorption ability and longer fluorescence lifetime, all of which contribute to enhancing photocatalytic performance. More importantly, C/N-TiO2-VO exhibited exceptional performance in the photoreduction of CO2 to CO, achieving nearly 100% selectivity in pure water, with a CO evolution rate of 53.97 &#956;mol g-1 h-1. This rate was 10.8 and 8.1 times higher than that of TiO2 and C/N-TiO2, respectively. Further theoretical calculations illustrated that stronger local charges and defect levels are formed on the surface of C/N-TiO2-VO compared with TiO2(101), facilitating the dissociation of CO2 and the conversion of CO2 into *COOH intermediates. Furthermore, in situ DRIFTS results confirmed the formation of crucial intermediate *COOH during CO2 photoreduction. This study presents a viable approach for designing highly active photocatalysts through the synergistic effects of doping and vacancies.</description>

      <title>Mineral chemistry of chrome- diopside bearing lamprophyre from Mesoproterozoic Settupalle complex of Prakasam Alkaline Province: Insights on the magma dynamics at shallow lithospheric mantle beneath the NE margin of the Cuddapah Basin, Southern India</title>

      <description>N. Sridhar, Ragi Mallikarjuna Reddy, Rohit Pandey, Sourav Naskar, Kirtikumar Randive, Kuldeep Singh, Special publication - Geological Society of London/Geological Society, London, special publications. 551(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399129107

                Abstract The Eastern Dharwar Craton (EDC) shows considerable variations in the activity of Kimberlite, lamproite, and lamprophyre and their related lithospheric thickness, thermal structure, and magmatic source characteristics from the innermost core to the margin. These variations have been revealed through seismic studies and the analysis of xenoliths, and xenocrysts carried in alkaline magmas, particularly kimberlites. This study reports the occurrence of chrome diopside phenocrysts from a lamprophyre of the Settupalle pluton, located on the northeastern margin of the Cuddapah basin, Prakasam Alkaline Province (PAP) in South India. Studied lamprophyre characterized by phenocrystic clinopyroxene (Cpx) and biotite, embedded in a groundmass of amphibole, biotite, opaques, calcite, feldspar, nepheline, and sodalite, with the latter minerals forming ocellar structures. Clinopyroxene displays normal zoning, with a high Mg-Cr rich diopside core (up to 1.92 wt%) and a Na 2 O, Al 2 O 3 , FeO, and TiO 2 -enriched salite rim. These chemical variations, along with elemental substitutions from core to rim, indicate the significant role of fractionation in the evolution of lamprophyre magma. The lack of chemical disparity among the studied Cpx, suggests closed-system fractionation, under high oxygen fugacity conditions. Thermobarometry results indicate polybaric crystallization for the Cpx (1206&#8211;1269 &#176;C, 11.82&#8211;18.04 kbar) and biotite (825&#8211;856 &#176;C, 3.49&#8211;6.94 kbar). The gradient inferred from the pressure of the Cpx suggests that its crystallization occurred at a depth of 43-66 km, implying shallow lithospheric magma contribution for the genesis of the lamprophyre magma.

      <title>Ni and Co Catalysts on Interactive Oxide Support for Anion Exchange Membrane Electrolysis Cell (AEMEC)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/inorganics12060153</link>

                The work presents novel composite catalytic materials&#8212;Ni and Co deposited on Magneli phase titania&#8212;and describes their complex characterization and integration into membrane electrode assemblies to produce hydrogen by electrochemical water splitting in cells with anion exchange membranes (AEMEC). Chemical composition, surface structure, and morphology were characterized by XRD and SEM analysis. The activity in the evolution of the partial electrode reactions of hydrogen (HER) and oxygen (OER) was assessed in an aqueous alkaline electrolyte (25 wt.% KOH) using linear sweep voltammetry. The interactive role of the support was investigated and discussed. Among the tested samples, the sample with 30 wt.% Co (Co30/MPT) demonstrated superior performance in the OER. The reaction started at 1.65 V, and at 1.8 V, the current density reached 75 mA cm&#8722;2. The HER is most efficient on the sample containing 40 wt.% Ni (Ni40/MPT), where the current density reaches 95 mA at a potential of &#8722;0.5 V. The change in catalytic efficiency compared to that of the unsupported Ni and Co is due to synergism resulting from electronic interactions between the transition metal having a hyper-d-electron character and hypo-d-electron support. The pre-selected catalysts were integrated in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) using commercial and laboratory-prepared anion-conductive membranes and tested in a custom-made AEMEC. The performance was compared to that of MEA with a commercial carbon-supported Pt catalyst. It was found that the MEA with newly prepared catalysts demonstrated better performance in long-term operation (50 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.8 V in a 60 h durability test), which, combined with the higher cost efficiency, gave credence to considering this combination of materials as promising for AEMEC applications.</description>

      <title>A high-precision interpretable framework for marine dissolved oxygen concentration inversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2024.1396277</link>

                Variations in Marine Dissolved Oxygen Concentrations (MDOC) play a critical role in the study of marine ecosystems and global climate evolution. Although artificial intelligence methods, represented by deep learning, can enhance the precision of MDOC inversion, the uninterpretability of the operational mechanism involved in the &#8220;black-box&#8221; often make the process difficult to interpret. To address this issue, this paper proposes a high-precision interpretable framework (CDRP) for intelligent MDOC inversion, including Causal Discovery, Drift Detection, RuleFit Model, and Post Hoc Analysis. The entire process of the proposed framework is fully interpretable: (i) The causal relationships between various elements are further clarified. (ii) During the phase of concept drift analysis, the potential factors contributing to changes in marine data are extracted. (iii) The operational rules of RuleFit ensure computational transparency. (iv) Post hoc analysis provides a quantitative interpretation from both global and local perspectives. Furthermore, we have derived quantitative conclusions about the impacts of various marine elements, and our analysis maintains consistency with conclusions in marine literature on MDOC. Meanwhile, CDRP also ensures the precision of MDOC inversion: (i) PCMCI causal discovery eliminates the interference of weakly associated elements. (ii) Concept drift detection takes more representative key frames. (iii) RuleFit achieves higher precision than other models. Experiments demonstrate that CDRP has reached the optimal level in single point buoy data inversion task. Overall, CDRP can enhance the interpretability of the intelligent MDOC inversion process while ensuring high precision.</description>

      <title>Phase-field simulation of high-temperature corrosion of binary Zr-2.5Sn alloys</title>

                Due to the small neutron absorption cross section and excellent thermal creep performance, zirconium alloy is one of the most important cladding materials for fuel rods in commercial fission reactors. However, quantitative analysis of the effects of temperature and grain boundaries on the corrosion microstructure evolution of zirconium alloys is still needed. It is of great significance to establish a phase field simulation for the corrosion process of polycrystalline zirconium alloy and systematically investigate the thermodynamic impact. In this study, the phase field model of the corrosion process in zirconium alloys was developed by incorporating corrosion electrochemistry to calculate the interfacial energy at the metal-oxide and oxide-fluid boundaries. Then model was then employed to investigate the uniform corrosion behavior on the surface of Zr-2.5Sn alloy, which demonstrated that the corrosion kinetics curve followed a cubic rule. Subsequently, the influence of temperature on the corrosion thickening curve of zirconium alloys was examined, and good agreement between simulation and experimental results was achieved. It was observed that during early stages of oxide layer formation, there is a high growth rate with minimal temperature dependence; however, as the oxide layer thickness increases, temperature becomes a significant factor affecting its growth rate, with higher temperatures resulting in faster corrosion rates. Furthermore, an investigation into the effect of polycrystalline zirconium alloy matrices on corrosion rates revealed that grain boundaries accelerate oxide layer thickening due to enhanced oxygen diffusion rates. Along these grain boundaries towards the metal matrix at metal-oxide interfaces, regions with higher O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; concentrations form an O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; band which primarily influences oxidation-corrosion rates during initial oxidation stages.</description>

      <title>Hydrochemical characteristics of abandoned coal mines derived acid mine drainage in a typical karst basin (Wuma river basin, Guizhou China)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e31963</link>

                The hydrochemical characteristics of acid mine drainage (AMD) were investigated in Wuma River Basin, China. AMD was sampled from nine closed coal mine (CCM) sites to study the temporal and spatial evolution of pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity (ED), total hardness (THR), total dissolved salt (TDS), and trace elements. The surface water (river) and groundwater surrounding mine sites were sampled to evaluate the potential pollution derived from AMDs. The TDS content of AMD was higher than that of surface water and groundwater. The dominant factors influencing TDS were the pH, temperature, and wet or dry season (which played a role in controlling microbial activity), HCO3- balance, and REDOX during the evolutionary process. The hydrochemical type of AMD was dependent on the evolutionary stage. From observations, most AMDs were in the form of the SO42--Ca2+&#8226;Mg2+ type that was characterized by a low pH, low [HCO3-], high [SO42-], and high [Fe]. In addition, the AMD samples were undergoing stage I and II processes, in which SO42- and trace elements were generated. The surface water and groundwater were primarily classified as the HCO3--Ca2+&#8226;Mg2+ type, which accounted for their self-cleaning capacity, as indicated by the high [HCO3-]. The surface water and groundwater could be affected by the surrounding AMD depending on the geographical location. The surface water and groundwater sites that were located downstream of subsurface and surface runoff were obviously affected by AMD. After being polluted by AMD, surface water and groundwater contained higher levels of trace elements and emerged as the HCO3-&#8226;SO42--Ca2+&#8226;Mg2+ type.</description>

      <title>Sub&#8208;2 Nm Micro&#8208;Strained High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Nanoparticles Boosts Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202403674</link>
      <description>Heng Luo, L&#252; Li, Fangxu Lin, Q. Zhang, Kai Wang, Dawei Wang, Lin Gu, Mingchuan Luo, Fan Lv, Shaojun Guo, Advanced materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399019008

                Abstract High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) confine multifarious elements into the same lattice, leading to intense lattice distortion effect. The lattice distortion tends to induce local microstrain at atomic level and thus affect surface adsorptions towards different adsorbates in various electrocatalytic reactions, yet remains unexplored. Herein, we report a class of sub&#8208;2 nm IrRuRhMoW HEA nanoparticles (NPs) with distinct local microstrain induced by lattice distortion for boosting alkaline hydrogen oxidation (HOR) and evolution reactions (HER). We demonstrate that the distortion&#8208;rich HEA catalysts with optimized electronic structure can downshift the d&#8208;band center and generate uncoordinated oxygen sites to enhance the surface oxophilicity. As a result, the IrRuRhMoW HEA NPs show a remarkable HOR kinetic current density of 8.09 mA &#956;g &#8208;1 PGM at 50 mV versus RHE, 8.89, 22.47 times higher than those of IrRuRh NPs without internal strain and commercial Pt/C, respectively, which is the best value among all the reported non&#8208;Pt based catalysts. IrRuRhMoW HEA NPs also display great HER performances with a TOF value of 5.93 H 2 s &#8208;1 at 70 mV versus RHE, 4.6&#8208;fold higher than that of Pt/C catalyst, exceeding most noble metal&#8208;based catalysts. Experimental characterizations and theoretical studies collectively confirm that weakened hydrogen (H ad ) and enhanced hydroxyl (OH ad ) adsorption are achieved by simultaneously modulating the hydrogen adsorption binding energy and surface oxophilicity originated from intensified ligand effect and microstrain effect over IrRuRhMoW HEA NPs, which guarantees the remarkable performances toward HOR/HER.

      <title>Linkage of Diabetic Retinopathy with Blood Antioxidants and Gut Microbiota in Type Two Diabetes Mellitus Saudi Patients</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.46889/joar.2024.5202</link>

                Background: The retina is a light-sensitive nerve layer located at the back of the eye that creates images of objects. These cells kept alive by getting oxygen and nutrients from tiny blood vessels in the eye. Retinopathy is a disease of the retina that is more prevalent in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness because hyperglycemia weakens retinal capillaries, resulting in leakage of blood into the surrounding space. This bleeding can result in formation of scar tissue, which can cause traction retinal detachment and maculopathy. The development of a panel of blood biomarkers to monitor diabetic retinopathies is essential for both diagnosis and prognosis. Proteomics as a powerful tool for the analysis of complex mixtures of proteins and the identification of biomarkers can be of great importance. Purpose: To detect early nerve fiber layer changes around macula and optic disc in diabetic patients and to correlate diabetic retinopathy with blood antioxidants and gut microbiota in T2DM in Saudi patients. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional case-control study, a total of 77 eyes of 39 subjects aged 40-60 years who did not have any history of eye injuries or eye diseases affecting fundus viewing, were recruited from King Saud University Campus and the department of ophthalmology in King Abdul Aziz university hospital in Riyadh. All subjects underwent full ophthalmic examination including Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and macular profile, Proteomic approach of collected overnight fasting plasma and Microbial stool examination. Results: The nerve fiber layer thickness around the optic disc was measured for all groups and there was no statistically significant difference in all quadrants between groups. The total retinal thickness at the macular area was different among all groups and tends to increase in group 3 due to diabetic retinopathy. The macular thickness in the 4 quadrants revealed no statistical difference except in the inferior quadrant. Glutathione S transferase and lipid peroxides showed no significant difference between the three studied groups; vitamin C and Glutathione were surprisingly higher in controlled diabetic patients relative to controls. Moreover, over growth of bacteroids participated to the evolution of retinopathy in diabetic patients. Conclusion: As hyperglycemia and oxidative stress are implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, the present study certified that the progressive damage can be delayed in controlled type 2 diabetic patients using different treatment modalities that subside oxidative stress.</description>

      <title>Smooth muscle cell-specific deletion of S100A4 modifies smooth muscle cell fate and inflammation in murine atherosclerotic lesions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/cvae088.166</link>
      <description>P Azar, L M Cardoso Dos Santos, Marta Correia de Sousa, ML Bochaton-Piallat, Cardiovascular research. 120(Supplement_1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4399136901

                Abstract Funding Acknowledgements Type of funding sources: Public grant(s) &#8211; National budget only. Main funding source(s): Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) S100A4, a calcium-binding protein, is crucial in smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypic switch, yet its role in atherosclerotic plaque development and SMC plasticity remains unclear. Our previous experiments using an S100A4 neutralizing antibody approach in ApoE-/- atherosclerotic-prone mice showed reduced atherosclerotic burden but did not establish a direct link between the various S100A4-expressing cells and atherosclerosis. Herein, we show that aortic Oil RedO staining in ApoE-/-; S100A4-/- mice subjected to a 12-week high-cholesterol-diet (HCD) revealed reduced lesion areas compared to ApoE-/- mice (Figure 1, from 21.29% of the total aorta in ApoE-/-; S100A4+/+ mice to 13.27% in ApoE-/-; S100A4-/- mice), highlighting a pivotal role for S100A4 in atherosclerotic plaque development. We then used a lineage tracing ApoE-/- mouse model, in which we induced an SMC-specific deletion of S100A4 (SMC-S100A4&#916;/&#916;). After 12 weeks of HCD, SMC-S100A4&#916;/&#916; and control mice (SMC-S100A4wt/wt) were sacrificed, and aortas were processed for en face Oil Red O staining, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). SMC-specific deletion of S100A4 reduced the necrotic core area (from 29.75% of total plaque area in SMC-S100A4wt/wt to 18.23% in SMC-S100A4&#916;/&#916; mice) without affecting total atherosclerotic plaque size suggesting a more potent impact on plaque composition. ScRNA-seq analysis from SMC-S100A4&#916;/&#916; and SMC-S100A4wt/wt mice showed that the inflammatory macrophage-like SMC phenotype was highly suppressed in the plaque and associated with increased SMC repair phenotypes as well as a global reduction of myeloid inflammatory cells. SMCs also retained specific contractile SMC markers, namely Acta2 and Myh11 (fold change of 2.285 and 2.492, respectively) hinting towards a more stable fibrous cap. Immunofluorescence staining on aortic roots plaque (Figure 2) confirmed those results with an increase of SMCs (from 11.02% to 16.18%) as well as a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA, Acta2)-positive SMCs (from 3.25% to 5.1%) in SMC-S100A4 &#916;/&#916; mice. Furthermore, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of scRNAseq data revealed that, in SMC-S100A4&#916;/&#916; mice, genes related to mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative respiration were highly downregulated in all SMC clusters. We investigated SMC mitochondrial fitness in vitro and showed that S100A4-/- SMCs have an increased basal oxygen consumption rate and an increased proton leak (fold change of 1.37 and 1.96 respectively) suggestive of differences in cellular metabolic adaptability. In conclusion, our research emphasizes the significant role of S100A4 in plaque development, demonstrating how SMC-derived S100A4 knockdown affects plaque evolution, reducing inflammation, and promoting stability likely through influencing SMC phenotypic switch through metabolic pathways.</description>
