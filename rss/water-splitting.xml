                Abstract Active and robust electrocatalysts for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are of crucial importance for efficient proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEM&#8208;WE). Ruthenium (Ru) oxide has attracted considerable attention due to its high activity. However, the unsatisfying stability of Ru oxide in acidic OER environments hinders the application. Here, Ce&#8208;doped RuO 2 nanoparticles are designed and supported on Co&#9472;N&#9472;C material (Ce@RuO 2 /CoNC) for acidic OER. It is demonstrated that Ce@RuO 2 /CoNC delivers a super low overpotential of 150 mV and an excellent stability of 1000 h at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , outperforming most previously reported Ru&#8208;based catalysts. The mass activity is estimated as 2365.5 Ag Ru &#8722;1 at 1.5 V (vs RHE), representing &#8776;2&#215; advance compared to the best prior study. Furthermore, applied in a single&#8208;cell PEM&#8208;WE device, it can steadily operate for 1000 h at 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . The studies show that Ce&#8208;doping and Co&#9472;N&#9472;C support synergistically enhance the activity and stability of Ru oxide by optimizing the free energies of OER intermediates and suppressing the dissolution of Ru.</description>

      <title>Revealing Enhanced Active Oxygen Formation by Incorporating Chromium into Nickel Hydroxide Nanosheets for Improved Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.4c02441</link>
      <description>Seunghwa Lee, Gyeong Hee Ryu, The Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403051890

                Nickel-based oxyhydroxides have emerged as promising catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) among Earth-abundant metals. While the incorporation of foreign elements is recognized to enhance catalytic activity, the origin of this enhancement is still debated. We synthesize and examine Ni hydroxide nanosheets, both with and without Cr doping, to elucidate the underlying enhancements. Operando UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy are employed to unravel the behavior of the catalysts. The Cr doping facilitates the oxidation of Ni, resulting in the generation of active oxygen species. The enriched active oxygen species improves OER performance through a lattice oxygen-mediated pathway in Fe-free KOH, and further contribute to the creation and increased activity of FeO</description>

                High-/medium-entropy materials have been explored as promising electrocatalysts for water splitting due to their unique physical and chemical properties. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art materials face the dilemma of explaining the enhancement mechanism, which is now limited to theoretical models or an unclear cocktail effect. Herein, a medium-entropy NiCoFeMnP with an advanced hierarchical particle-nanosheet-tumbleweed nanostructure has been synthesized via simple precursor preparation and subsequent phosphorization. Evaluated as the electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the medium-entropy NiCoFeMnP displays a lower overpotential of 272 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm</description>

                High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs), similar to high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs), have "four&#8208;core effects", i.e., high&#8208;entropy effect, delayed diffusion effect, lattice distortion effect and cocktail effect, which have attracted more and more attention in the scientific field of renewable energy technology due to their unique structural characteristics, variable chemical composition and corresponding functional properties. HEOs have become potential candidates for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which is a key half reaction for electrolytic CO2, nitrogen reduction, and water electrolysis. However, the precise synthesis of HEOs with a wide range of components and structures is challenging, not to mention their active and stable operation for OER. In this paper, we review the recent advancements in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution facilitated by HEOs in water electrolysis. We analyze these developments from the perspectives of activity and stability in acid and alkaline conditions, respectively. Furthermore, we summarize the design from the aspect of element composition, structure, morphology, and catalyst&#8208;support interactions, along with related reaction mechanism of HEOs. Additionally, we discuss the current challenges faced by HEOs in the field of OER and suggest potential directions for the future development of HEOs beyond water electrolysis application.</description>

      <title>Formation of Ni&#8208;MOF Derived Nickel Sulfides as Efficient Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction Through Optimizing the Sulfur Sources Selection</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/slct.202403487</link>

                Abstract Developing low&#8208;cost and exceedingly efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is vital for application of hydrogen production from water splitting. Herein, three different nickel sulfides on nickel foam were fabricated via a simple sulfuring the as&#8208;formed Ni&#8208;MOF with different sulfide as the sulfur source. The effect of sulfur source on OER performance, morphology and structure of the as&#8208;prepared product are well discussed. The optimized Ni&#8208;MOF/NF&#8208;SS deliver overpotentials of 253 and 330 mV to reach current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm &#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 70.9 mVdec &#8722;1 , and stability of over 50 h. This work provides insights into the relationship between the OER activity and the structures of nickel sulfides, but also affords a new route to fabricate nickel sulfides&#8208;based electrocatalysts for OER.</description>

      <title>Flexible PET/Carbon/NiFe&#8208;LDH Electrode for Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Water&#8208;Splitting</title>

                Abstract The development of low&#8208;cost, readily scalable catalytic systems for green hydrogen production is crucial for diverse research and industrial applications. This work demonstrates the facile coupling of carbon/NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) onto flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates deposited by blade coating and spray coating techniques. These low&#8208;temperature solution processes enable high&#8208;throughput electrode fabrication. The resulting carbon electrode exhibits sheet resistance of 25 &#937; sq &#8722;1 , comparable to other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art works, and displays excellent adhesion to the substrate and catalyst layer, thereby ensuring system stability. Remarkably, the developed electrode exhibits high catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), achieving an overpotential of 215.9 and 267.4 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722; 2 in rigid and flexible substrates respectively, and maintaining its performance even at 10 mA cm &#8722; 2 for 24 h. This work highlights the potential of this methodology for producing readily transportable, flexible electrocatalytic systems with exceptional performance and minimal surface treatment of the substrate. Additionally, the use of low&#8208;cost, readily recyclable PET plastic aligns with the principles of circular economy, promoting the integration of this platform into both research and industrial environments.</description>

                Abstract This research examines the effective use of two specific precursor i.e Hydrochloric acid and Oxalic acid used in the synthesis of Tungsten oxide (WO3). Catalytic reactions including Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR) and Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) was investigated with the synthesised material. The morphological as well as electrochemical characteristics were studied using Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FESEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), UV spectroscopy along with electrochemical analysis. It is being found that the WO3 synthesised with oxalic acid (WO3-ox) demonstrated in superior HER catalysis, whereas the other variant (WO3 with HCl (WO3-h)) showed better ORR performance. An optical bandgap of 2.638 eV was obtained for WO3-ox. Moreover, electrochemical analysis revealed an ORR peak at 0.52 V for WO3-h, in acidic media of electrolyte. As a result of which the two electrocatalyst were utilised in two different applications. WO3-ox was used for Methylene Blue (MB) degradation under the UV light and WO3-h was incorporated as a cathode catalyst for electricity generation and wastewater treatment in Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC). A degradation efficiency of 83.9% was attained in a span of 3 hours. On the other hand, MFC showed superior electrical power density of 209.72 mW/m2 with catalyst as compared to bare carbon cloth electrode (139.78 mW/m2). The chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency, which acts as a measure of wastewater treatment was 1.47 folds higher with the MFC having the catalyst. Thus, by tailored modulation of synthesised material with different precursor can lead to optimization of its features for various applications like degradation of methylene blue and microbial fuel cell.</description>

      <title>In Situ Reconstructing NiFe Oxalate Toward Overall Water Splitting</title>

                Abstract Surface reconstruction plays an essential role in electrochemical catalysis. The structures, compositions, and functionalities of the real catalytic species and sites generated by reconstruction, however, are yet to be clearly understood, for the metastable or transit state of most reconstructed structures. Herein, a series of NiFe oxalates (Ni x Fe 1&#8208; x C 2 O 4 , x = 1, 0.9, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, and 0) are synthesized for overall water splitting electrocatalysis. Whilst Ni x Fe 1&#8208;x C 2 O 4 shows great hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity, the in situ reconstructed Ni x Fe 1&#8208;x OOH exhibits outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. As identified by the in situ Raman spectroscopy and quasi&#8208;in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques, reconstructions from Ni x Fe 1&#8208;x C 2 O 4 into defective Ni x Fe 1&#8208;x OOH and finally amorphous Ni x Fe 1&#8208;x OOH active species (R&#8208;Ni x Fe 1&#8208;x OOH) are confirmed upon cyclic voltammetry processes. Specifically, the fully reconstructed R&#8208;Ni 0.6 Fe 0.4 OOH demonstrates the best OER activity (179 mV to reach 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ), originating from its abundant real active sites and optimal d&#8208;band center. Benefiting from the reconstruction, an alkaline electrolyzer composed of a Ni 0.6 Fe 0.4 C 2 O 4 cathode and an in situ reconstructed R&#8208;Ni 0.6 Fe 0.4 OOH anode achieves a superb overall water splitting performance (1.52 V@10 mA cm &#8722;2 ). This work provides an in&#8208;depth structure&#8208;property relationship understanding on the reconstruction of catalysts and offers a new pathway to designing novel catalyst.</description>

      <title>Band alignment of CoO(100)&#8211;water and CoO(111)&#8211;water interfaces accelerated by machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0224137</link>
      <description>Jinyuan Hu, Yong&#8208;Bin Zhuang, Jun Cheng, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 161(13)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403103930

                Cobalt monoxide (CoO) nanomaterials have drawn attention for their remarkable photocatalytic water splitting without an externally applied potential or co-catalyst. The success of overall water splitting is due to the appropriate band edge positions of the catalyst, which span the redox potentials of water splitting. Typically, CoO nanomaterials possess complex morphologies, which consist of multiple active surfaces. As a result, the precise roles of the surfaces in the overall water-splitting process remain to be elucidated. In this work, we have undertaken a thorough investigation into the band alignments at the CoO(100)&#8211;water and CoO(111)&#8211;water interfaces using ab initio molecular dynamics and machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics simulations. The results of band alignment reveal that CoO(100) supports both the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction, whereas CoO(111) only facilitates the HER. Moreover, the variance in band positions between CoO(100) and CoO(111) results in an intrinsic potential difference, facilitating the migration of electrons toward CoO(100), while holes accumulate on CoO(111). The separation of photoexcited carriers effectively promotes water splitting in CoO.</description>

                Abstract Developing high&#8208;efficiency alkaline water splitting technology holds great promise in potentially revolutionizing the traditional petrochemical industry to a more sustainable hydrogen economy. Importantly, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) accompanied at the anode is considered as a critical bottleneck in terms of both complicated mechanism and sluggish kinetics, requiring rational design of OER electrocatalysts to elucidate the structure&#8208;performance relationship and reduce the applied overpotential. As a benchmarked non&#8208;precious metal candidate, NiFe&#8208;based electrocatalysts have gained enormous attention due to low&#8208;cost, earth&#8208;abundance, and remarkable intrinsic OER activity, which are expected to be implemented in industrial alkaline water splitting. In this contribution, a comprehensive overview of NiFe&#8208;based OER electrocatalysts is provided, starting with fundamental mechanisms, evaluation metrics, and synthetic protocols. Subsequently, basic principles with corresponding regulatory strategies are summarized following the sequence of substrate&#8208;catalyst&#8208;electrolyte design of efficient and robust NiFe&#8208;based electrocatalysts toward industrial&#8208;scale deployment. Perspectives on remaining challenges and instructive opportunities in this booming field are finally discussed.</description>

                During the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), catalyst candidates that can fully trigger self-reconstruction to derive active species with favorable configurations are expected to overcome the sluggish reaction kinetics. Herein, we innovatively propose the introduction of heterogeneous vanadate dopants into nickel-iron alloy precatalysts, where the crystal mismatch structure induces local electron delocalization in the hexagonal close packed alloy phase, thereby facilitating adequate electrochemical reconstruction to form (oxy)hydroxides as the real catalytic species. Simultaneously, the participation of vanadate in the reconstruction also triggers mismatch in the derived (oxy)hydroxides, reinforcing the metal-oxygen covalence, so that lattice oxygen activation is kinetically favorable and facilitates the OER via the lattice oxygen pathway.

                The development of advanced bifunctional catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is significant for rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). Herein, a unique dual active center alloying strategy is proposed to achieve the efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysis, and the high entropy effect is further exploited to modulate the structure and performance of the catalysts. The MOF&#8208;assisted pyrolysis&#8208;replacement&#8208;alloying method was employed to construct the CoCuFeAgRu high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA), which are uniformly anchored in porous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanosheets. Notably, the obtained HEA catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance for both ORR and OER, and a peak power density of 136. 53 mW cm&#8208;2 and an energy density of 987.9 mAh gZn&#8208;1, surpassing the most of the previously reported bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts. Moreover, the assembled flexible rechargeable ZAB enables excellent performance even at the ultralow temperature of &#8208;40&#176;C, with an energy density of 601.6 mAh gZn&#8208;1 and remarkable cycling stability up to 1,650 hours. Combined experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the excellent bifunctional catalytic activity of the HEA catalyst originated from the synergistic effect of the Ag and Ru dual active centers, and the optimization of the electronic structure by alloying effect.</description>

                Abstract Green hydrogen energy, as one of the most promising energy carriers, plays a crucial role in addressing energy and environmental issues. Oxygen evolution reaction catalysts, as the key to water electrolysis hydrogen production technology, have been subject to durability constraints, preventing large&#8208;scale commercial development. Under the high current density and harsh acid&#8208;base electrolyte conditions of the water electrolysis reaction, the active metals in the catalysts are easily converted into high&#8208;valent soluble species to dissolve, leading to poor structural durability of the catalysts. There is an urgent need to overcome the durability challenges under acidic conditions and develop electrocatalysts with both high catalytic activity and high durability. In this review, the latest research results are analyzed in depth from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives. First, a comprehensive summary of the structural deactivation state process of noble metal oxide catalysts is presented. Second, the evolution of the structure of catalysts possessing high durability is discussed. Finally, four new strategies for the preparation of stable catalysts, &#8220;electron buffer (ECB) strategy&#8221;, combination strength control, strain control, and surface coating, are summarized. The challenges and prospects are also elaborated for the future synthesis of more effective Ru/Ir&#8208;based catalysts and boost their future application.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the counterpart in the hydrogen production by the water electrolysis. Further challenges have been required to bypass the energy consumption processes in OER. It is still important to unveil the OER intermediates toward the effective green hydrogen production. In this study, we conducted the in-situ Raman observation of the OER intermediates over Ni nanohole-array electrodes in the various electrolyte conditions. Ni nanohole-array electrodes were prepared with the interference exposure methods. Intense Raman peaks were observed from the Ni-OH, Ni-OOH, and active oxygen species as OER intermediates. The OER behavior can be classified with the reactants, such as OH&#8722; and H2O. The presented study demonstrates the importance of the electrolyte for the designing active OER catalysis for the next generation energy society.</description>

      <title>Rational Design of Diatomic Active Sites for Elucidating Oxygen Evolution Reaction Performance Trends</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202413749</link>
      <description>Nanfeng Xu, Yuxiang Jin, Qiunan Liu, Meng Yu, Zibo Wang, Xiaogang Wang, Wei Tu, Zhirong Zhang, Zhigang Geng, Kazu Suenaga, Fangyi Cheng, Erhong Song, Zhangquan Peng, Junyuan Xu, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403140470

                Diatomic catalysts, especially those with heteronuclear active sites, have recently attracted significant attention for their advantages over single&#8208;atom catalysts in reactions with relatively high energy barrier, e.g. oxygen evolution reaction. Rational design and synthesis of heteronuclear diatomic catalysts are of immense significance but have so far been plagued by the lack of a definitive correlation between structure and catalytic properties. Here, we report macrocyclic precursor constrained strategy to fabricate series of transition metal (MT, Ni, Co, Fe, Mn, or Cu)&#8208;noble (MN, Ir or Ru) centers in carbon material. One notable performance trend is observed in the order of Cu&#8208;MN &lt; Mn&#8208;MN &lt; Fe&#8208;MN &lt; MN &lt; Co&#8208;MN &lt; Ni&#8208;MN. However, the pathway has been not altered, still following the traditional adsorption reaction mechanism. The effect of the MT atoms on the performances could possibly originate from the distinct adsorption/desorption behaviors of key intermediates (i.e. *OH, *O and/or *OOH), strongly implying that &#916;G*OOH&#8208;&#916;G*OH could be used as the performance descriptor. We believe that our work provides useful strategy for synthesis of diatomic active sites with sole coordination configuration and varied composition, and in&#8208;depth insight to their catalytic mechanism, which could be used for further optimization of diatomic catalysts towards oxygen electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Measurement of Gross Oxygen Evolution and Underlying Photosynthetic Redox Reactions: A Case Study Using Cyanobacteria</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.03.616403</link>
      <description>Oded Liran, bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403143045

                In phytoplankton, the intricate balance between respiration and photosynthesis is co-regulated to ensure efficient energy management and adaptation to varying environmental conditions. In cyanobacteria, both processes occur on the same membrane, sharing electron transport carriers within the same cellular compartment. By studying the interaction between photosynthesis and respiration, we can better understand how cyanobacteria balance their energetic budget for survival. In this study, we present an integrated approach that combines tracking gas exchange between cyanobacteria and their environment with analysing the redox kinetics of the underlying photosynthetic electron transport chain. This combined system allows for real-time, simultaneous acquisition of respiration and photosynthesis data. For example, it enabled us to show that the electron transport rate generated by photosystem II, translated to in-vivo oxygen concentration, equals the actual concentration of oxygen produced by water splitting plus the amount of oxygen respired. We further demonstrate that our system can accurately assess light respiration in wild-type strains of cyanobacteria, which amounts to 1/10 of their photosynthetic activity under optimal growth conditions. This level of accuracy was previously achievable only with specific cyanobacteria mutants. We envision applying this system in monitoring programs to elaborate on the role of photosynthetic light reactions within the broader context of primary productivity and to understand its dynamics in response to fluctuations in external environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Oxygen&#8208;doped Porous Ultrathin Graphitic Carbon Nitride Nanosheets for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution and Rhodamine B Degradation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cplu.202400474</link>

                Graphite phase carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is a highly promising metal-free photocatalyst. However, its applicability is restricted by low activity, due to weak quantum efficiency and small specific surface area. Exfoliating bulk crystals into porous thin-layer nanosheets and introducing element doping have been shown to improve photocatalytic efficiency, but these methods are often complex, time-consuming, and costly processes. In this study, we successfully synthesized porous oxygen-doped g-C3N4 (OCN) nanosheets utilizing a straightforward method. Our findings show that OCN have much higher light absorption and visible-light photocatalytic activity than bulk g-C3N4 (BCN) and nonporous g-C3N4 (CN). The OCN photocatalyst has a remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) rate of 8.02 mmol&#183;g-1 h-1, which is 8 times greater than BCN. Additionally, the OCN shows a high degradation rate of 97.3% for Rhodamine B (RhB). This enhanced photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the narrow band gap and superior electron transfer capacity. Our findings suggest a potential technique for generating efficient g-C3N4 photocatalysts.</description>

                Boosting the reaction stability without sacrificing the activity and cost is extremely important but full of challenging for the RuO2&#8208;based oxygen evolution catalysts. Herein, porous and B&#8208;site substituted Y2[Mn0.2Ru0.8]2O7 (p&#8208;Y2[Mn0.2Ru0.8]2O7) pyrochlore toward oxygen evolution reaction is innovatively synthesized. The formed meso/macro&#8208;porous structure can increase the specific surface area and corresponding active sites, meanwhile, Mn&#8208;substitution can modulate the electronic structure, stabilize the morphology, and reduce the dosage of Ru species. Excitingly, the p&#8208;Y2[Mn0.2Ru0.8]2O7 performs 50 h stable operation, significantly outperforming the commercial RuO2(CM) counterpart with less than 2 h life. Furthermore, the required overpotential to achieve 10 mA cm&#8208;2 is only 266 mV, accompanied with favorable reaction kinetics and catalyst utilization.</description>

      <title>Cobalt Molybdenum Telluride as an Efficient Trifunctional Electrocatalyst for Seawater Splitting</title>

      <description>R.K. Kar, Amideddin Nouralishahi, Harish Singh, Manashi Nath, Catalysts. 14(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403072426

                A mixed-metal ternary chalcogenide, cobalt molybdenum telluride (CMT), has been identified as an efficient tri-functional electrocatalyst for seawater splitting, leading to enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The CMT was synthesized by a single step hydrothermal technique. Detailed electrochemical studies of the CMT-modified electrodes showed that CMT has a promising performance for OER in the simulated seawater solutions, exhibiting a small overpotential of 385 mV at 20 mA cm&#8722;2, and superior catalyst durability for prolonged period of continuous oxygen evolution. Interestingly, while gas chromatography analysis confirmed the evolution of oxygen in an anodic chamber, it showed that there was no chlorine evolution from these electrodes in alkaline seawater, highlighting the novelty of this catalyst. CMT also displayed remarkable ORR activity in simulated seawater as indicated by its four-electron reduction pathway forming water as the dominant product. One of the primary challenges of seawater splitting is chlorine evolution from the oxidation of dissolved chloride salts. The CMT catalyst successfully and significantly lowers the water oxidation potential, thereby separating the chloride and water oxidation potentials by a larger margin. These results suggest that CMT can function as a highly active tri-functional electrocatalyst with significant stability, making it suitable for clean energy generation and environmental applications using seawater.</description>

                Abstract Rechargeable alkaline zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZAB) hold great promise as a viable, sustainable, and safe alternative energy storage system to the lithium&#8208;ion battery. However, the practical realization of ZABs is limited by their intrinsically low energy trip efficiency, stemming from a large charge and discharge potential gap. This overpotential is attributed to the four&#8208;electron oxygen evolution and reduction reactions and their sluggish kinetics. Here, a new concept based on two&#8208;electron generation and consumption of hydrogen peroxide at the air electrode is introduced. The O 2 /peroxide chemistry, facilitated by a newly developed Ni&#8208;based bifunctional electrocatalyst, enables fast peroxide generation/consumption, exceptional energy efficiency, high durability, and high capacity. Hence, this new design offers substantial progress toward the commercialization of high energy density metal&#8211;air batteries.</description>

                ABSTRACT In this study, we have synthesized facile Cu&#8208;based CuO:Er 2 O 3 nanoelectrode material for energy storage and generation. CuO:Er 2 O 3 nanomaterial was synthesized employing phyto&#8208;extract of Amaranthus viridis L. (AVL) as stabilizing and reducing agents. Spherical&#8208;shaped CuO:Er 2 O 3 nanomaterial was initially employed to study supercapacitor behavior. The specific capacitance of 82.25 F/g was found at 0.5 A/g by galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge, whereas the value of 319 F/g was achieved at 2 mV/s by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. Furthermore, CuO:Er 2 O 3 electrode was investigated for water splitting energy generation potential and revealed an overpotential value of 323 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). However, for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), an overpotential value of 370 mV was found. The electrochemical impedance analysis revealed the faster flow of electrons and ions, suggesting great conductivity and lower resistance of the fabricated electrode. Thus, current electrochemical results are proposing CuO:Er 2 O 3 as an competent electrode for overall energy&#8208;generating as well as storage applications.</description>

                Abstract Alkaline water electrolysis at high temperatures can rival acidic proton-exchange membranes.&amp;#xD;However, they suffer from increased energy consumption, reduced lifespan of materials and heightened safety risks. Magnetic hyperthermia is a method of localizing intense heating in the presence of an external high-frequency alternating magnetic field. In this study, we developed a custom electromagnetic induction device capable of generating a small magnetic field of about 2 &#181;T. High-permeability nickel foam is used as electrodes. Results show that the iron coated nickel foam decreases the overpotential of the hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction by ~150 mV and 60 mV, respectively, at 20 mAcm&#8722;2 when subjected to magnetic heating in a high-frequency alternating magnetic field. The overall water splitting current of Ni foam/Fe increases 540% under intermittent induction. The enhanced stability of Ni foam/Fe is attributed to the high binding energy of metal-O on the surface. The density function theory calculations further indicates that the lattice expansion of the metal electrode under induction heating optimizes the adsorption and desorption of H*, thereby enhancing the HER performance.&amp;#xD;</description>

                Abstract Heterostructured interfaces are crucial to electrocatalysts for water splitting. Herein, coral&#8208;like multiheterostructured Ni x B/Mo 0.8 B 3 (NMB) nanorods encapsulated by a boron&#8208;rich amorphous layer are prepared for water splitting. Density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the NMB interface adjusts the d &#8208;band center and electronic structure of the molybdenum sites. Owing to the strong electronic coupling between Ni, Mo, and B at the heterojunction, large number of exposed catalytic active sites, as well as the special hydrophilic characteristics endowed by the surrounding amorphous layer, the NMB catalyst exhibits remarkable universal&#8208;pH hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity with low overpotentials ( &#951; ) of 15, 26, and 83 mV to deliver 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in basic, acid, and neutral media, respectively, and outstanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) characteristics in the basic medium with &#951; 10 and &#951; 500 of 170 and 420 mV, respectively. The unique self&#8208;supporting 3D hierarchical interconnected structure facilitates mass transport thus leading to high mechanical stability for 450 and 200 h in HER and OER at &#8776;1000 mA cm &#8722;2 . More importantly, the NMB exhibits excellent performance toward overall&#8208;water electrolysis as a bifunctional catalyst with ultralow cell voltages of 1.45/1.56/1.85 V @ 10/100/1000 mA cm &#8722;2 , demonstrating the large potential in industrial water splitting applications.</description>

      <title>A Review of Hydrogen Production via Seawater Electrolysis: Current Status and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14100691</link>
      <description>Yi Xin Zhang, Yukui Zhang, Zhichuan Li, Ende Yu, H. J. Ye, Zihang Li, Margot Pellegrino, Daojin Zhou, Cheng Wang, Qihao Sha, Yun Kuang, Catalysts. 14(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403136707

                Seawater electrolysis represents a promising green energy technology with significant potential for efficient energy conversion. This study provides an in-depth examination of the key scientific challenges inherent in the seawater-electrolysis process and their potential solutions. Initially, it analyzes the potential issues of precipitation and aggregation at the cathode during hydrogen evolution, proposing strategies such as self-cleaning cathodes and precipitate removal to ensure cathode stability in seawater electrolysis. Subsequently, it addresses the corrosion challenges faced by anode catalysts in seawater, introducing several anti-corrosion strategies to enhance anode stability, including substrate treatments such as sulfidation, phosphidation, selenidation, and LDH (layered double hydroxide) anion intercalation. Additionally, this study explores the role of regulating the electrode surface microenvironment and forming unique coordination environments for active atoms to enhance seawater electrolysis performance. Regulating the surface microenvironment provides a novel approach to mitigating seawater corrosion. Contrary to the traditional understanding that chloride ions accelerate anode corrosion, certain catalysts benefit from the unique coordination environment of chloride ions on the catalyst surface, potentially enhancing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Lastly, this study presents the latest advancements in the industrialization of seawater electrolysis, including the in situ electrolysis of undiluted seawater and the implementation of three-chamber dual anion membranes coupled with circulating electrolyte systems. The prospects of seawater electrolysis are also explored.</description>

      <title>Integration of Multifunctionality in a Colloidal Self&#8208;Repairing Catalyst for Alkaline Water Electrolysis to Achieve High Activity and Durability</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/aesr.202400196</link>

                Self&#8208;repairing catalysts are useful for achieving alkaline water electrolyzers with long lifetimes under intermittent operation. However, rational methodologies for designing self&#8208;repairing catalysts have not yet been established. Herein, hybrid cobalt hydroxide nanosheets (Co&#8208;ns), with a high deposition (repairing) rate, and &#946;&#8208;FeOOH nanorods (Fe&#8208;nr), with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) ability, are electrostatically self&#8208;assembled into composite catalysts. This strategy is developed to integrate multifunctionality in self&#8208;repairing catalysts. Positively charged Co&#8208;ns and negatively charged Fe&#8208;nr form uniform composites when dispersed in an electrolyte. These composites are electrochemically deposited on a nickel electrode by electrolysis at 800 mA cm &#8722;2 . Co&#8208;ns form a conductive mesoporous assembly of CoOOH nanosheets as a support. Fe&#8208;nr are then distributed on the CoOOH nanosheets as active sites for the OER. Because of the high deposition rate of Co&#8208;ns, the amount of Fe&#8208;nr deposited increases 22 times compared to when Fe&#8208;nr is deposited alone, and the OER current density increases 14 times compared to that of Co&#8208;ns alone. The composite self&#8208;repair catalyst shows the highest activity and durability under an accelerated durability test (ADT), and its degradation rate decreases from 84 &#956;V cycle &#8722;1 (Fe&#8208;nr only) to 60 &#956;V cycle &#8722;1 (composite catalyst) under ADT conditions without repair.</description>

      <title>Green Hydrogen, an Alternative Renewable Energy Source: Based on Solar-Energy-Driven Water-Splitting Technology</title>

                The need for zero-emission, eco-friendly hydrogen fuel has increased enormously over the years due to adverse impacts on the environment caused by conventional fuels such as natural gas, coal, oil, fossil fuels, bio-mass etc. This chapter reports the safest and most efficient route for hydrogen-fuel production based on solar-energy-driven watersplitting technology over a heterogeneous photo-catalyst. Several challenges have been made for the extension of photo-catalyst, based on nano-sized semiconducting materials such as binary and ternary metal chalcogenides nano-materials, CuS, CdS, Fe3O4, CuInO2, CuInS2, CuGaS2 and their composites with hetero-nanostructure. When the nano-structures have the ability to absorb solar-light-energy (having a narrow band gap energy &lt; 3.6 eV), i.e., to utilise the most of the solar-spectrum, the photo-catalytic performances have increased much more. The catalytic performances of the semiconductors have also been improved for enhanced hydrogen production using nano-engineering technology, i.e., different modifications to the nano-catalyst surface and electronic energy structure, so that they can act as an efficient photo-catalyst for solar-energy driven water electrolysis to produce enhanced large-scale hydrogen-fuel. The possible mechanism of the photo-chemical processes has also been explored through the formation of free electron-hole pair (e- /h+) on suitable heterogeneous catalyst&#8217;s surface and controlling the kinetics of hydrogen evolution reaction and oxygen evolution reaction. How the proposed nano-catalyst materials have been designed to optimize solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency, improve the rate of hydrogen production and commercialized for the sake of society has been deliberated.</description>

                Abstract This study investigated the treatment of petroleum-contaminated water from the crude oil storage tank by employing sequential coupling electrocoagulation and electrochemical oxidation using Fe and Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrodes as the sacrificial and oxidation anodes respectively. Although the Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrode is commonly used, its short lifetime disadvantages have limited its performance in industrial applications. A long-standing (highly stable) Ti/Sb-SnO2 electrode with high electro-oxidation capability was fabricated by applying an electrodeposited-annealed Sb-SnO2 interlayer between the Ti substrate and the Top Sb-SnO2 coating. Physical characterization results, including Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), revealed the presence of SnO2 and Sb in the anode composition. The surface appeared flat with a uniform spherical shape, averaging about 13&#8211;22 nm in size. The 2 V oxygen evolution overpotential and the accelerated lifetimes of 11 hours demonstrated that using the electro-deposited interlayer improved the electrocatalytic performance and stability of the electrode for electro-oxidation applications. The highest COD removal of the mentioned wastewater was optimized using the RSM methodology for EC and EO, respectively. The integrated EC-EO process achieved a maximum COD reduction efficiency of 96.5% at a current density of 20 mA/cm2, with electrodes placed 2.5 cm apart in a neutral pH environment for 120 minutes.</description>

                The results of the development and study of catalysts for the anode of water decomposition electrolyzers with a proton exchange membrane are presented. To deposit catalytic layers on a titanium carrier, the magnetron method of sputtering composite targets in a vacuum was used. Iridium and ruthenium were used as the main catalyst, and molybdenum, chromium, and titanium were used as functional additives. The electrochemical and structural characteristics of catalytic coatings have been studied. Using voltammetry methods, cyclic current-voltage and anodic characteristics of catalytic compositions were obtained, including at different temperatures of subsequent heat treatment in air, as well as at different measurement temperatures. The Tafel slopes of the current-voltage characteristics of the composite anodes, as well as the currents at a potential of 1.55 V (RHE), were determined. It has been shown that the minimum slopes were obtained for the Ir&#8211;Ru&#8211;Mo&#8211;Ti catalytic composition (b = 40&#8211;63 mV/dec), and the maximum currents for the Ir&#8211;Mo&#8211;Cr catalytic composition (i = 100&#8211;110 mA/cm2 at E = 1.55 V (RHE)). It has been shown that the magnitude of CV adsorption currents in the anodic potential region correlates with the coefficient b of the Tafel equation E&#8211;lgi and determines the number of catalytic centers for the deprotonization stage of the oxygen evolution reaction. However, the activity of the catalyst in the OER is determined not only by the number of such centers, but mainly by the functional features of the catalyst itself, i.e., the composition of the catalyst and the conditions for its preparation (including the temperature of subsequent heat treatment of the catalyst in air). Catalytic compositions based on iridium with additions of molybdenum and chromium have higher activity in OER. Structural studies have shown that during magnetron sputtering of composite targets, even with small catalyst loadings, dispersed structures are formed, which on real porous titanium anodes should form on the front surface with a higher catalyst content.</description>

                Roof-harvested rainwater presents a promising, unconventional, and sustainable water resource for both potable and non-potable uses. However, there is a significant gap in understanding the quality evolution of stored rainwater under varying dissolved oxygen conditions and its suitability for various applications. This study investigated the evolution of rainwater quality under three distinct storage conditions: aerated, open, and sealed. Additionally, the microbial community and metabolic functions were analyzed to systematically evaluate the self-purification performance over long-term storage durations. The results indicate that aerated storage enhances microbial carbon metabolism, leading to a degradation rate of 54.4 %. Sealed and open storage conditions exhibited primary organic matter degradation during the early and late stages, respectively. Roof-rainwater harvesting (RRWH) systems showed limited denitrification activity across all three dissolved oxygen conditions. The maximum accumulation of NO</description>

      <title>Application of the MELTS program to the fractional crystallization of low-alumina alkaline magma on Jeju Volcanic Island, Korea</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1186/s40562-024-00360-8</link>
      <description>Huy L&#234;, Cheolwoo Chang, Sung-Hyo Yun, Geoscience Letters. 11(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403148993

                Abstract Jeju Volcanic Island is the largest island in South Korea and is considered a continental shelf intraplate volcanic island. In this study, MELTS, a powerful program for modeling magmatic evolution processes, was applied to simulate the fractional crystallization process of the low-alumina alkaline volcanic rock suite on Jeju Island. MELTS modeling was conducted at many isobaric pressures ranging from 2.0 GPa to 0.1 GPa, different oxygen fugacities (fO 2 ) from FMQ-3 to FMQ + 3, and different H 2 O contents. The results demonstrate that the most suitable fractionation model for the Jeju low-alumina alkaline magma involves a pressure of 0.2 GPa to 0.1 GPa and an oxygen fugacity close to the FMQ buffer. Additionally, an H 2 O content of 0.5 wt.% is the most consistent with the evolution trend and mineral composition of the natural rock suite on Jeju Island. Although MELTS possesses several limitations in terms of the stability of calibration, such as spinel overestimation and a lack of experiments on hydrous minerals (which should be improved), MELTS performs well in terms of temperature and pressure prediction and in terms of the assessment of other factors of the fractional crystallization process on Jeju Island. Consequently, to evaluate a magmatic process in a particular region, MELTS should be combined with other analyses and not relied upon independently.</description>

                Abstract In this study, we systematically investigated the high-temperature protection performance and evolution behavior of three different SiOC coatings (1050SiOC, 1100SiOC, 1150SiOC) under different atmospheres. The coatings were prepared by the organometallic chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method and characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) techniques. It was found that the composition and microstructure of SiOC coatings, environmental atmosphere, and heat treatment temperature can affect the thermal stability and high-temperature reaction mechanism of SiOC coatings. Further, it was revealed that the three SiOC coatings only exhibit the same high-temperature evolution behavior and reaction mechanism in an air environment while exhibiting different high-temperature evolution behavior and reaction mechanisms in both an inert atmosphere and a reduced air atmosphere. Among the coatings prepared, the 1050SiOC coating demonstrated the highest on-set oxidation temperature under identical oxygen content conditions. This characteristic may contribute to the coating&#8217;s excellent resistance to high-temperature oxidation.&amp;#xD;</description>

      <title>An in-silico study of conventional and FLASH radiotherapy iso-effectiveness: potential impact of radiolytic oxygen depletion on tumor growth curves and tumor control probability</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ad8291</link>

                Abstract &amp;#xD;Objective: This work aims to investigate the iso-effectiveness of conventional and FLASH radiotherapy on tumors through in-silico mathematical models. We focused on the role of radiolytic oxygen depletion (ROD), which has been argued as a possible factor to explain the FLASH effect.&amp;#xD;&amp;#xD;Approach: We used a spatiotemporal reaction-diffusion model, including ROD, to simulate tumor oxygenation and response. From those oxygen distributions we obtained surviving fractions (SFs) using the linear-quadratic (LQ) model with the oxygen enhancement ratios (OER). We then employed the calculated SFs to describe the evolution of preclinical tumor volumes through a mathematical model of tumor response, and we also extrapolated those results to calculate tumor control probabilities (TCPs) using the Poisson-LQ approach.&amp;#xD;&amp;#xD;Main results: Our study suggests that the ROD effect may cause differences in SF between FLASH and conventional radiotherapy, especially in low &#945;/&#946; and poorly oxygenated cells. However, a statistical analysis showed that these changes in SF generally do not result in significant differences in the evolution of preclinical tumor growth curves when the sample size is small, because such differences in SF may not be noticeable in the heterogeneity of the population of animals}. Nonetheless, when extrapolating this effect to TCP curves, we observed important differences between both techniques (TCP is lower in FLASH radiotherapy). When analyzing the response of tumors with heterogeneous oxygenations, differences in TCP are more important for well oxygenated tumors. This apparent contradiction with the results obtained for homogeneously oxygenated cells is explained by the complex interplay between the heterogeneity of tumor oxygenation, the OER effect, and the ROD effect.&amp;#xD;&amp;#xD;Significance: This study supports the experimentally observed iso-effectiveness of FLASH and conventional radiotherapy when analyzing the volume evolution of preclinical tumors (that are far from control). However, this study also hints that tumor growth curves may be less sensitive to small variations in SF than tumor control probability: ROD may lead to increased SF in FLASH radiotherapy, which while not large enough to cause significant differences in tumor growth curves, could lead to important differences in clinical TCPs. Nonetheless, it cannot be discarded that other effects not modeled in this work, like radiation-induced immune effects, can contribute to tumor control and maintain the iso-effectiveness of FLASH radiotherapy. The study of tumor growth curves may not be the ideal experiment to test the iso-effectiveness of FLASH, and experiments reporting TCP or D50 may be preferred.</description>

                Abstract Reduced oxygen availability (hypoxia) represents a key plant abiotic stress in natural and agricultural systems, but conversely it is also an important component of normal growth and development. We review recent advances that demonstrate how genetic adaptations associated with hypoxia impact the known plant oxygen sensing mechanism through the PLANT CYSTEINE OXIDASE (PCO) N-degron pathway. Only three protein substrates of this pathway have been identified, and all adaptations identified to date are associated with the most important of these, the group VII ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR transcription factors (ERFVIIs). We discuss how geography, altitude, and agriculture have all shaped molecular responses to hypoxia, and how these responses have emerged at different taxonomic levels through the evolution of land plants. Understanding how ecological and agricultural genetic variation acts positively to enhance hypoxia tolerance will provide novel tools and concepts to improve the performance of crops in the face of increasing extreme flooding events.</description>

                Abstract Grain boundary (GB) mass transport, and chemistry exert a pronounced influence on both the performance and stability of electrodes for solid oxide electrochemical cells. Lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCF6428) is applied as a model mixed ionic and electronic conducting (MIEC) perovskite oxide. The cation&#8208;vacancy distribution at the GBs is studied at both single and multi&#8208;grain scales using high&#8208;resolution characterization techniques and computational approaches. The accumulation of oxygen vacancies () in the GB region, rather than necessarily at the GB core, results in an enhancement of the oxygen diffusivity by 3 &#8211; 4 orders of magnitude along the GBs ( D gb ). At 350 &#176;C, the oxygen tracer diffusion coefficient ( D *) is measured as 2.5 &#215; 10 &#8722;14 cm 2 s &#8722;1 . The D gb is determined to be 2.8 &#215; 10 &#8722;10 cm 2 s &#8722;1 assuming a crystallographic GB width (&#948; crystal ) of 1 nm, and 2.5 &#215; 10 &#8722;11 cm 2 s &#8722;1 using a chemically measured &#948; chem of 11.10 nm by atom probe tomography (APT). The origin of the concomitant changes in the cation composition is also investigate. In addition to the host cations, strong Na segregation is detected at all the GBs examined. Despite the low (ppm) level of this impurity, its presence can affect the space charge potential (&#934; 0 ). This, in turn, will influence the evolution of GB chemistry.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Isotope Exchange Between Dust Aggregates and Ambient Nebular Gas</title>

                Meteorites and their components exhibit a diverse range of oxygen isotope compositions, and the isotopic exchange timescale between dust grains and ambient gas is a key parameter for understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of the solar nebula. As dust grains existed as macroscopic aggregates in the solar nebula, it is necessary to consider the isotopic exchange timescales for these aggregates. Here, we theoretically estimate the isotope exchange timescales between dust aggregates and ambient vapor. The isotope exchange process between aggregates and ambient vapor is divided into four processes: (i) supply of gas molecules to the aggregate surface, (ii) diffusion of molecules within the aggregate, (iii) isotope exchange on the surface of constituent particles, and (iv) isotope diffusion within the particles. We evaluate these timescales and assess which one becomes the rate-determining step. We reveal that the isotope exchange timescale is approximately the same as that of the constituent particles when the aggregate radius is smaller than the critical value, which is a few centimeters when considering the exchange reaction between amorphous forsterite aggregates and water vapor.</description>

      <title>Recent Achievements in Heterogeneous Bimetallic Atomically Dispersed Catalysts for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries: A Minireview</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202406776</link>
      <description>Sanshuang Gao, Lian Kang, Xinzhong Wang, Xijun Liu, Abdukader Abdukayum, Qingquan Kong, Guangzhi Hu, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4403139836

                Abstract Rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) hold promise as the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices owing to their affordability, environmental friendliness, and safety. However, cathodic catalysts are easily inactivated in prolonged redox potential environments, resulting in inadequate energy efficiency and poor cycle stability. To address these challenges, anodic active sites require multiple&#8208;atom combinations, that is, ensembles of metals. Heterogeneous bimetallic atomically dispersed catalysts (HBADCs), consisting of heterogeneous isolated single atoms and atomic pairs, are expected to synergistically boost the cyclic oxygen reduction and evolution reactions of ZABs owing to their tuneable microenvironments. This minireview revisits recent achievements in HBADCs for ZABs. Coordination environment engineering and catalytic substrate structure optimization strategies are summarized to predict the innovation direction for HBADCs in ZAB performance enhancement. These HBADCs are divided into ferrous and nonferrous dual sites with unique microenvironments, including synergistic effects, ion modulation, electronic coupling, and catalytic activity. Finally, conclusions and perspectives relating to future challenges and potential opportunities are provided to optimise the performance of ZABs.</description>

      <title>Tracing rate and extent of human-induced hypoxia during the last 200 years in the mesotrophic lake, Tiefer See (NE Germany)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-4317-2024</link>

                Abstract. The global spread of lake hypoxia, [O2] &lt; 2 mg L&#8722;1, during the last 2 centuries has had a severe impact on ecological systems and sedimentation processes. While the occurrence of hypoxia was observed in many lakes, a detailed quantification of hypoxia spread at centennial timescales remained largely unquantified. We track the evolution of hypoxia and its controls during the past 200 years in a lake, Tiefer See (TSK; NE Germany), using 17 gravity cores recovered from between 10 and 62 m water depth in combination with lake monitoring data. Lake hypoxia was associated with the onset of varve preservation in the TSK and has been dated by varve counting to 1918 &#177; 1 at 62 m water depth and reached a lake floor depth of 16 m in 1997 &#177; 1. This indicates that oxygen concentration fell below the threshold for varve preservation at the lake floor (&gt; 16 m). Sediment cores at 10&#8211;12 m depth do not contain varves indicating good oxygenation of the upper-water column. Monitoring data show that the threshold for hypoxia, and the intensity and duration of hypoxia which are sufficient for varve preservation, is a period of 5 months of [O2] &lt; 5 mg L&#8722;1 and 2 months of [O2] &lt; 2 mg L&#8722;1. Detailed total organic carbon (TOC), &#948;13Corg, and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) core scanning analyses of the short cores indicate that the decline in dissolved oxygen (DO) started several decades prior to the varve preservation. This proves a change in the depositional conditions in the lake, following a transition phase of several decades during which varves were not preserved. Furthermore, varve preservation does occur at seasonal stratification and does not necessarily require permanent stratification.</description>

                Accurate atmospheric parameters and chemical composition of planet hosts play a major role in characterising exoplanets and understanding their formation and evolution. Our objective is to uniformly determine atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen(O), and the alpha -elements, magnesium (Mg) and silicon (Si), along with C/O, N/O and Mg/Si abundance ratios for planet-hosting stars. In this analysis, we aim to investigate the potential links between stellar chemistry and the presence of planets. e tai Observatory telescope. The determination of stellar parameters was based on a standard analysis using equivalent widths and one-dimensional, plane-parallel model atmospheres calculated under the assumption of local thermodynamical equilibrium. The differential synthetic spectrum method was used to uniformly determine the carbon C(C2), nitrogen N(CN), oxygen O I magnesium Mg I, and silicon Si I elemental abundances as well as the C/O, N/O, and Mg/Si ratios. We analysed elemental abundances and ratios in dwarf and giant stars, finding that C/Fe O/Fe and Mg/Fe are lower in metal-rich dwarf hosts; whereas N/Fe is close to the Solar ratio. Giants show smaller scatter in C/Fe and O/Fe and lower than the Solar average C/Fe and C/O ratios. The (C+N+O) abundances increase with Fe/H in giant stars, with a minimal scatter. We also noted an overabundance of Mg and Si in planet-hosting stars, particularly at lower metallicities, and a lower Mg/Si ratio in stars with planets. In giants hosting high-mass planets, nitrogen shows a moderate positive relationship with planet mass. C/O and N/O ratios show moderate negative and positive slopes in giant stars, respectively. The Mg/Si ratio shows a negative correlation with planet mass across the entire stellar sample.</description>

      <title>Phenanthridine&#8208;based Covalent Organic Frameworks for Boosting Overall Solar H2O2 Production</title>

                Solar&#8208;driven H2O2 production via the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and water oxidation reaction (WOR) dual channels is green and sustainable, but severely restricted by the sluggish reaction kinetics. Constructing intriguing photocatalysts with effective active centers is a shortcut to breaking the kinetic bottleneck with great significance. Herein, we synthesize two novel neutral phenanthridine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (PD&#8208;COF1 and PD&#8208;COF2) for photosynthesizing H2O2. Compared to the no phenanthridine counterpart (AN&#8208;COF), the H2O2 photosynthetic activities of PD&#8208;COF1 and PD&#8208;COF2 are markedly boosted. In air and pure water without sacrificial agents, under Xe lamp and natural sunlight, the H2O2 photogeneration rate of PD&#8208;COF2 is 6103 and 3646 &#956;mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, respectively. Further experimental and theoretical inspections demonstrate that introducing phenanthridine units into COFs smoothly modulates the charge carrier dynamics and thermodynamically favors the generation of crucial OOH* and OH* intermediates in the ORR and WOR paths, respectively. Additionally, this is the first time the neutral phenanthridine moiety serves as the photooxidation unit for 2e&#8208; WOR towards H2O2 photoproduction. The current work sheds light on exploring novel catalytic centers for high&#8208;performance H2O2 evolution.</description>

                The work is dedicated to highlighting the influence of prominent inventors on the development of culture and the traditions of invention, which play a key role in shaping national identity and industrial culture. The article analyzes how innovations and technological achievements of individuals contribute to the formation of national pride, raising awareness, and strengthening the international image of a nation. Special attention is given to inventions that have become symbols of national progress and reflect unique cultural traits embedded in the collective consciousness of the people. The study emphasizes the importance of invention as an integral part of national culture and its significance in building a society focused on innovation and development. In particular, the research highlights the most important moments in the life and scientific activity of a prominent Polish inventor closely connected with Odesa. It traces the evolution of creative ideas and the diversity of interests of Stefan Drzewiecki, whose multifaceted and extraordinary creative interests are reflected in innovations that were groundbreaking in the mechanical engineering of that time. Special attention is given to inventions in the field of submarine construction, particularly the creation of the first military submarine prototype. The structural features of the submarine stimulated further research, which, in turn, led to new inventions. These included the development of an autonomous power system using batteries, an oxygen storage and supply system, and equipment for submarine maneuvering. Many of the proposed solutions were revolutionary for their time and significantly advanced global shipbuilding.</description>

                Oxygen deprivation or hypoxia is poorly dealt with by most terrestrial species and often leads to permanent tissue damage and death. One prominent exception is the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) which is remarkably adapted to withstand prolonged periods (~18 mins) of severe hypoxia, a trait likely driven by its crowded underground lifestyle. Other African mole-rat species are less social or entirely solitary like the Cape mole-rat (Georychus capensis). Here, we asked whether cellular and molecular adaptations to hypoxia map to social traits. We discovered that at the cellular level naked mole-rat fibroblasts survive &gt;30 hours in 1% oxygen, while fibroblasts from terrestrial or non-social mole-rat species (human, mouse and Cape mole-rat) die rapidly under hypoxic conditions. We further show that naked mole-rat mitochondria have evolved morphological, functional and proteomic adaptations crucial for hypoxia resistance, remaining unaffected after long periods of severe hypoxia. We identify the mitochondrial protein Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1) as a key player in naked mole-rat hypoxia resilience. Naked mole-rat mitochondria not only express more protective forms of OPA1, but also harbor a structurally unique isoform that likely protects cells from hypoxic damage. We show that evolutionary changes including the functionalization of a unique Opa1 exon support mitochondrial mediated cellular protection. Indeed, knockdown of OPA1 in naked mole-rat cells is sufficient to render them equally susceptible to hypoxia as human cells or cells from non-social African species. Our study demonstrates how molecular evolution drives unique adaptations that enable cells to achieve unprecedented resistance to hypoxic damage. We also show that molecular changes at the level of mitochondria are crucial in conferring hypoxia resistance. Our results thus chart a novel molecular path to understand how robust cellular hypoxia resistance can be achieved. Such knowledge may eventually inspire novel strategies to circumvent the consequences of hypoxic-damage in humans.</description>

                Abstract We explore the relations between the gas-phase metallicity radial profiles (few hundred inner parsec) and multiple galaxy properties for 15 Seyfert galaxies from the AGNIFS (Active Galactic Nuclei Integral Field Spectroscopy) sample using optical Integral Field Unit (IFU) observations from Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs (GMOS) and Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) processed archival data. The data were selected at z &#8818; 0.013 within black hole mass range [6 &amp;lt; log (MBH/M&#8857;) &amp;lt; 9] with moderate 14&#8211;150 keV X-ray luminosities $\left[42\, \lesssim \, \log L_X (\rm erg\, s^{-1})\, \lesssim \, 44\right]$. We estimated the gas-phase metallicity using the strong-line methods and found mean values for the oxygen dependent (Z &#8764; 0.75 Z&#8857;) and nitrogen dependent (Z &#8764; 1.14 Z&#8857;) calibrations. These estimates show excellent agreement with &#916;Z &#8776; 0.19 dex and &#916;Z &#8776; 0.18 dex between the mean values from the two strong-line calibrations for GMOS and MUSE respectively, consistent with the order of metallicity uncertainty via the strong-line methods. We contend that our findings align with a scenario wherein local Seyferts have undergone seamless gas accretion histories, resulting in positive metallicity profile over an extended period of time, thereby providing insights into galaxy evolution and the chemical enrichment or depletion of the universe. Additionally, we argue that metal-poor gas inflow from the local interstellar medium (ISM) and accreted through the circumgalactic medium (CGM) onto the galaxy systems regulates the star formation processes by diluting their central metallicity and inverting their metallicity gradients, producing a more prominent anti-correlation between gas-phase metallicity and Eddington ratio.</description>

      <title>Cathodoluminescence textures and trace elements in quartz: Constraints on Ag mineralization in adularia&#8211;sericite epithermal systems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2138/am-2024-9415</link>

                Abstract Quartz chemistry is important for revealing fluid sources and evolution in hydrothermal deposits, but such information is lacking for many epithermal systems and deposit types. To investigate quartz chemistry in this system further, we collected representative samples of quartz from adularia-sericite epithermal Ag deposits in China and determined their chemical compositions. In adularia-sericite epithermal Ag-bearing systems, magmatic quartz from porphyry intrusions and host subvolcanic rocks is SEM-CL spectral peaks at 360 and 415 nm and exhibits homogenous CL or weak zonal textures (alternating growth zones within individual quartz crystal). Trace elements in magmatic quartz have the lowest Sb concentrations (median = 0.1 ppm; n = 80). Hydrothermal quartz can be classified into type I and type II by CL false color and CL spectral peaks. Hydrothermal type I quartz has spectral peaks at 360 and 415 nm, exhibits zonal or sector textures, and is associated with base metal sulfides and minor Ag mineralization. Such hydrothermal type I quartz has low Sb concentrations (median = 4.5 ppm; n = 839), contains liquid-rich fluid inclusions and formed by cooling. The cooling trend is indicated by a positive correlation between the concentrations of Sb and Al, as well as between Li and Al. Hydrothermal type I quartz has an Fe center by electron spin resonance, whereas other centers are missing or weak at room temperature. In general, hydrothermal type II quartz mantles type I quartz. Hydrothermal type II quartz has a very high intensity peak (by several orders of magnitude) at 580 nm, zonal textures, and is associated with abundant Ag mineralization. Hydrothermal type II quartz has the highest Sb concentrations (median = 71 ppm; n = 185), which remain constant as Al decreases on an Sb vs. Al plot. This quartz has colloform, bladed or zonal textures and contains coexisting liquid- and vapor-rich fluid inclusions, indicative of boiling. Additionally, this quartz has a significantly higher E'1 center intensity, suggesting a high concentration of oxygen vacancies associated with rapid crystallization. The mineral paragenesis, analytical results, and geochemical models show that in these Ag-bearing epithermal systems hydrothermal type I quartz associated with base metal sulfides precipitated during cooling whereas subsequent growth zoned hydrothermal type II quartz with high Sb concentrations and Ag-minerals precipitated during boiling. These results suggest that the CL texture and spectra, trace elements, and electron spin resonance data of quartz could identify veins with potential for Ag mineralization in epithermal systems.</description>
