      <title>Recent Research on Iridium&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction from the Origin of Reaction Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202403845</link>
      <description>L.-Y. Chen, Wei Zhao, Juntao Zhang, Min Liu, Jun Yin, Ru-Zhi Wang, Maorong Chai, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400122094

                As the anode reaction of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the main obstacles to the practical application of PEMWE due to its sluggish four-electron transfer process. The development of high-performance acidic OER electrocatalysts has become the key to improving the reaction kinetics. To date, although various excellent acidic OER electrocatalysts have been widely researched, Ir-based nanomaterials are still state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Hence, a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism of Ir-based electrocatalysts is crucial for the precise optimization of catalytic performance. In this review, the origin and nature of the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the derived volcanic relationship on Ir-based electrocatalysts for acidic OER processes are summarized and some optimization strategies for Ir-based electrocatalysts based on the AEM are introduced. To further investigate the development strategy of high-performance Ir-based electrocatalysts, several unconventional OER mechanisms including dual-site mechanism and lattice oxygen mediated mechanism, and their applications are introduced in detail. Thereafter, the active species on Ir-based electrocatalysts at acidic OER are summarized and classified into surface Ir species and O species. Finally, the future development direction and prospect of Ir-based electrocatalysts for acidic OER are put forward.</description>

                Chirality-induced spin selectivity observed in chiral 2D organic-inorganic hybrid perovskite holds promise to achieve spin-dependent electrochemistry. However, conventional chiral 2D perovskites suffer from low conductivity and hygroscopicity, limiting electrochemical performance and operational stability. Here, a cutting-edge material design is introduced to develop a stable and efficient chiral perovskite-based spin polarizer by employing fluorinated chiral cation. The fluorination approach effectively promotes the charge carrier transport along the out-of-plane direction by mitigating the dielectric confinement effect within the multi-quantum well-structured 2D perovskite. Integrating the fluorinated cation incorporated spin polarizer with BiVO</description>

      <title>High-Valence Cu Induced by Photoelectric Reconstruction for Dynamically Stable Oxygen Evolution Sites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c04975</link>

                Oxygen vacancies are generally considered to play a crucial role in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the generation of active sites created by oxygen vacancies is inevitably restricted by their condensation and elimination reactions. To overcome this limitation, here, we demonstrate a novel photoelectric reconstruction strategy to incorporate atomically dispersed Cu into ultrathin (about 2&#8211;3 molecular) amorphous oxyhydroxide (a-CuM, M = Co, Ni, Fe, or Zn), facilitating deprotonation of the reconstructed oxyhydroxide to generate high-valence Cu. The in situ XAFS results and first-principles calculations reveal that Cu atoms are stabilized at high valence during the OER process due to Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion, resulting in para-type double oxygen vacancies as dynamically stable catalytic sites. The optimal a-CuCo catalyst exhibits a record-high mass activity of 3404.7 A g&#8211;1 at an overpotential of 300 mV, superior to the benchmarking hydroxide and oxide catalysts. The developed photoelectric reconstruction strategy opens up a new pathway to construct in situ stable oxygen vacancies by high-valence Cu single sites, which extends the design rules for creating dynamically stable active sites.</description>

      <title>Programmable Wet-Interfacial Joule Heating to Rapidly Synthesize Metastable Protohematite Photoanodes: Metal and Lattice Oxygen Dual Sites for Improving Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.4c02690</link>
      <description>Jiujun Deng, Guoqing Li, Dongpeng Yan, Wei Zhang, Kun Feng, Kaiqi Nie, Changhai Liu, Xiaoxin Lv, Jun Zhong, ACS catalysis. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400166207

                High-temperature sintering is critical for efficient hematite photoanodes in terms of improving the crystallinity and minimizing deficiencies. However, prolonged conventional furnace annealing requires high energy consumption and simultaneously results in serious damage to the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrate. This work demonstrates a universal wet-interfacial Joule heating strategy for rapidly synthesizing high-performance metastable protohematite photoanodes, which greatly decreases the power consumption and causes less damage to the TCO substrate by shortening the sintering time to &#8764;90 s. More importantly, the protohematite phase was found to effectively facilitate the charge dynamics in the bulk and surface of the as-resulting photoanode by increasing donor density and lowering the oxygen evolution reaction overpotential via offering dual active sites (lattice oxygen and Fe sites). Moreover, this annealing strategy could be well coupled with commonly used Ti-treatment to achieve a further performance enhancement and also shows high feasibility in rapidly fabricating efficient TiO2 and BiVO4 photoanodes. This study opens a facile, rapid, and reliable approach for fabricating efficient metal oxide photoanodes, contributing to the development of photoelectrochemical water splitting.</description>

                Cobalt (Co)-based materials have been widely investigated as hopeful noble-metal-free alternatives for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolytes, which is crucial for generating hydrogen by water electrolysis. Herein, cobalt-based telluride particles with good electronic conductivity as anodic electrocatalysts were prepared under vacuum by the solid-state strategy, which display remarkable activities toward the OER. Nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) codoped cobalt telluride (NiFe-CoTe) exhibits an overpotential of 321 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm</description>

                Designing cost-effective and highly efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting is a significant challenge. We have systematically investigated a series of quasi-2D oxides, LaSrMn0.5M0.5O4 (M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn), to enhance the electrocatalytic properties of the two half-reactions of water-splitting, namely oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions (OER and HER). The four materials are isostructural, as confirmed by Rietveld refinements with X-ray diffraction. The oxygen contents and metal valence states were determined by iodometric titrations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Electrical conductivity measurements in a wide range of temperatures revealed semiconducting behavior for all four materials. Electrocatalytic properties were studied for both half-reactions of water-splitting, namely, oxygen-evolution and hydrogen-evolution reactions (OER and HER). For the four materials, the trends in both OER and HER were the same, which also matched the trend in electrical conductivities. Among them, LaSrMn0.5Co0.5O4 showed the best bifunctional electrocatalytic activity for both OER and HER, which may be attributed to its higher electrical conductivity and favorable electron configuration.</description>

                Transition-metal-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts have attracted widespread attention due to their inexpensive prices, unique layered structures, and rich active sites. Currently, designing low-cost, sustainable, and simple synthesis methods is essential for the application of transition-metal-based catalysts. Here, magnetic field (MF)-assisted chemical corrosion, as a novel technology, is adopted to construct superior OER electrocatalysts. The produced Ni(Fe)(OH)2-Fe2O3 electrode exhibits an overpotential of 272 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2, presenting a 64 mV reduction compared to the electrode without an MF. The experimental results indicate that an MF can induce the directional growth of Fe2O3 rods and reduce their accumulation. In addition, an external MF is beneficial for the lattice dislocation of the obtained catalysts, which can increase the surface free energy, thus reducing the activation energy and accelerating the electrochemical reaction kinetics. This work effectively combines a magnetic field with chemical corrosion and electrochemical energy, which offers a novel strategy for the large-scale development of environmentally friendly and superior electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract Doping transition metal oxide spinels with metal ions represents a significant strategy for optimizing the electronic structure of electrocatalysts. Herein, a bimetallic Fe and Ru doping strategy to fine&#8208;tune the crystal structure of CoV 2 O 4 spinel for highly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is presented performance. The incorporation of Fe and Ru is observed at octahedral sites within the CoV 2 O 4 structure, effectively modulating the electronic configuration of Co. Density functional theory calculations have confirmed that Fe acts as a novel reactive site, replacing V. Additionally, the synergistic effect of Fe, Co, and Ru effectively optimizes the Gibbs free energy of the intermediate species, reduces the reaction energy barrier, and accelerates the kinetics toward OER. As expected, the best&#8208;performing CoVFe 0.5 Ru 0.5 O 4 displays a low overpotential of 240 mV (@10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and a remarkably low Tafel slope of 38.9 mV dec &#8722;1 , surpassing that of commercial RuO 2 . Moreover, it demonstrates outstanding long&#8208;term durability lasting for 72 h. This study provides valuable insights for the design of highly active polymetallic spinel electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications.</description>

                Despite the challenges associated with the synthesis of flexible metal-covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), these offer the unique advantage of maximizing the atomic utilization efficiency. However, the construction of flexible MCOFs with flexible building units or linkages has rarely been reported. In this study, novel flexible MCOFs are constructed using flexible building blocks and copper clusters with hydrazone linkages. The heterometallic frameworks (Cu, Co) are prepared through the hydrazone linkage coordination method and evaluated as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Owing to the spatial separation and functional cooperation of the heterometallic MCOF catalysts, the as-synthesized MCOFs exhibited outstanding catalytic activities with an overpotential of 268.8 mV at 10 mA cm</description>

                The endeavor to architect bifunctional electrocatalysts that exhibit both exceptional activity and durability heralds an era of boundless potential for the comprehensive electrolysis of seawater, an aspiration that, nevertheless, poses a substantial challenge. Within this work, we describe the precise engineering of a three-dimensional interconnected nanoparticle system named SCdoped Co2VO4/CoP (SCCo2VO4), achieved through a meticulously arranged hydrothermal treatment sequence followed by gas-phase carbonization and phosphorization. The resulting SCCo2VO4 electrode exhibits outstanding bifunctional electrocatalytic stability, attributed to the strategic anionic doping and abundant heterogeneous interfaces. Doping not only adjusts the electronic structure, enhancing electron transfer efficiency but also optimizes the surface-active sites. This electrode prodigiously necessitated an extraordinarily minimal overpotential of merely 92 and 350 mV to attain current densities of 10 and 50 mA cm&#8722;2 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, in 1 M KOH solution. Noteworthily, when integrated into an electrolyzer for the exhaustive splitting of seawater, the SCP-Co2VO4 manifested an exceptionally low cell voltage of 2.08 V@50 mA cm&#8722;2 and showcased a durability that eclipses that of most hitherto documented nickel-based bifunctional materials. Further elucidation through Density Functional Theory (DFT) analyses underscored that anion doping and the inherent heterostructure adeptly optimize the Gibbs free energy of intermediates comprising hydrogen, chlorine, and oxygen (manifested as OH, O, OOH) within the HER and OER paradigms, thus propelling the electrochemical kinetics of seawater splitting to unprecedented velocities. These revelations unfurl a pioneering design philosophy for the creation of cost-effective yet superior catalysts aimed at the holistic division of water molecules, charting a course towards the realization of efficient and sustainable hydrogen production methodologies.</description>

                Abstract This study investigates the environmentally friendly synthesis of ZrO 2 &#8208;NdO mixed nanomaterial using green reducing and capping agents derived from the plant Amaranthus viridis . X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the successful synthesis of the mixed nanomaterial, revealing an optical band gap of 2.5 eV. The morphology was characterized by spherical&#8208;shaped particles with an average size ranging from 66 to 77 nm. The synthesized ZrO 2 &#8208;NdO mixed nanomaterial was evaluated for its potential application as an electrode material in energy devices, specifically for pseudocapacitors and water splitting studies. Electrochemical performance was assessed using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge&#8211;discharge (GCD) techniques. Notably, a specific capacitance of 573.5 F/g was achieved through CV at a scan rate of 2 mV/s. Fabricated electrocatalyst was further analyzed for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the results showed better over potential value of 164 mV for HER studies. The stability analysis further endorsed the large&#8208;scale commercialization possibility of ZrO&#8208;NdO&#8208;based electrode material.</description>

                Designing and synthesizing hollow frame structures with unique three-dimensional open structures in electrocatalysis remain a challenge. Etching is an effective method to synthesize metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with a hollow structure and rich function. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of Hf-doped CoP hollow nanocubes by selective etching and ion exchange. Different from the traditional etching method, we used acid xylenol orange solution to etch typically the (211) crystal face of ZIF-67, obtaining the unique bell-like structure, named XO-ZIF-67. Subsequently, Hf-doped CoP hollow nanocubes were formed by Hf</description>

                The water electrolysis is mostly limited by the slow kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) including the interfacial electron and mass transfer and autoionization reactions. Especially in the neutral pH condition, slow rate of the autoionization reaction of water molecules also limits the electrolysis. The vibrational strong coupling, where the matter excitation is coupled to the cavity vacuum field mediated by a virtual photon, can be expected to modulate the physicochemical properties of water. Here, we utilized the cavity-arrayed electrode for the promotion of the OER. The OER activities of Ni cavity-array electrodes were evaluated from the oxygen bubble growth behavior. The Tafel slopes from the bubble analyses were modulated from 120 mV per decade to 30 mV per decade and the OER activity was enhanced by the cavity-arrayed electrode. This enhancement was explained with regards to the acceleration of autoionization of water molecules under the vibrational strong coupling. This study demonstrates that the cavity systems modulate the thermodynamic equilibrium of water autoionization under the vibrational strong coupling of liquid water at room temperature, leading to enhanced OER.</description>

                Abstract Flexible rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (FZABs) exhibit high energy density, ultra&#8208;thin, lightweight, green, and safe features, and are considered as one of the ideal power sources for flexible wearable electronics. However, the slow and high overpotential oxygen reaction at the air cathode has become one of the key factors restricting the development of FZABs. The improvement of activity and stability of bifunctional catalysts has become a top priority. At the same time, FZABs should maintain the battery performance under different bending and twisting conditions, and the design of the overall structure of FZABs is also important. Based on the understanding of the three typical configurations and working principles of FZABs, this work highlights two common strategies for applying bifunctional catalysts to FZABs: 1) powder&#8208;based flexible air cathode and 2) flexible self&#8208;supported air cathode. It summarizes the recent advances in bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts and explores the various types of catalyst structures as well as the related mechanistic understanding. Based on the latest catalyst research advances, this paper introduces and discusses various structure modulation strategies and expects to guide the synthesis and preparation of efficient bifunctional catalysts. Finally, the current status and challenges of bifunctional catalyst research in FZABs are summarized.</description>

                The fabrication of bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution in aqueous environment has far-reaching significance. Especially, reasonable interface process regulation toward heterogeneous composites can make full use of the active sites and improve the electrocatalytic activity. In this study, we designed and synthesized NiS2-MoS2-based heterogeneous composites as efficient and stable electrocatalysts for hydrogen and oxygen evolution in alkaline electrolyte. The heterostructure was obtained by one-step hydrothermal ulfurization operation towards polymolybdate-based metal-organic complex. The composition and nanostructures can be tailored by modulating experiment parameter, realizing the phase-controlled synthesis and interface regulation: (1) High-percentage of 1T-MoS2 can be achieved via selecting appropriate vulcanization time and thiourea concentration, benifiting for the higher electroconductivity and more active sites; (2) Regular and orderly vulcanization time promotes the gradual growth and aggregation of nanosheets; (3) The existence of nickel hydroxide improves the electrocatalytic stability for oxygen production performance. The optimized heterogeneous interfaces provide sufficient active sites and accelerate electron transfer. Consequently, the optimal heterogeneous nanosheets present low overpotentials of 33 and 122 mV at the catalytic current densities of 10 mA/cm2 for HER and OER, respectively.</description>

                Among hydrogen production methods, water electrolysis stands out, but its efficiency is hampered by the substantial energy barrier of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To address this, incorporating electron&#8208;deficient boron (B) into Co&#8211;Fe hydroxide (CoFeO x H y ) promotes higher oxidation states of involved metals, greatly enhancing OER activity and charge transfer capabilities. Herein, the synthesis of a range of amorphous CoFeB nanoparticles with varying Fe to (Co+Fe) atomic ratios achieved through a simple chemical reduction method using CoFe&#8208;Prussian blue analogs as precursors and employing M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy to observe structural characteristics before and after transformation is reported. Among these nanoparticles, the CoFe 0.25 B variant, exhibiting favorable electrochemical properties, is chosen and subsequently subjected to hydrolysis to yield CoFe 0.25 BOH nanoparticles, serving as an active catalyst for OER. At a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , the overpotentials for CoFe 0.25 O x H y and CoFe 0.25 BOH are 362 and 310 mV, respectively, with Tafel slopes decreasing from 393 to 93 mV dec &#8722;1 . Furthermore, the i &#8211; t test reveals no significant loss of electrochemical performance within 24 h, substantiating the efficacy of enhancing the electrocatalytic performance of CoFeO x H y through the introduction of electron&#8208;deficient elements. This research offers novel insights into the development of efficient and stable water electrolysis catalysts.</description>

                The defects have been confirmed to activate catalytic sites and significantly enhance electrocatalytic activity. However, the influence of defects on the electronic spin state of catalytic active sites and their impact on catalytic behavior are still in the early stages of research. Spin behavior is a fundamental property of the electrons. Herein, using NiFe-LDH nanosheets as the model structure, we constructed trivalent cation vacancy models to gain a deeper understanding of the intrinsic relationship among defects, spin, and catalytic activity from the perspective of the electronic spin state. The presence of defects leads to an increased proportion of the dz2 orbital perpendicular to the plane and the dxy orbital parallel to the LDH layer, which enhancement effectively improves the capture of out-of-plane oxygen intermediates and facilitates electron transfer within the plane. As a result, the catalytic activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is greatly improved. In addition, magnetic field experiments may also be used to better understand the role of spin in the catalytic process. With the increase of defect concentration, the spin-magnetic response intensity of the OER can be effectively enhanced, which is related to the defect-induced spin single electron. This work explains how defects can effectively modulate the electron spin properties of active centers, thereby achieving enhanced catalytic reaction kinetics. By shedding light on the principles governing catalytic sites at the electron spin level, we would aid in the understanding and design of catalysts at the spintronic level.</description>

      <title>Multiphase Heterostructure Engineering and Theorical Aspects of a Hierarchical Nanostructure NiFe-NS/NiMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Array Enabling Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.4c00299</link>

                The design of multiphase heterostructures presents a promising strategy for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and serves as an effective approach to constructing efficient alkaline OER catalysts. In this paper, the OER catalyst with a NiFe-NS/NiMoO4 layered heterostructure was synthesized by reflux condensation and hydrothermal methods. The unique rock-like nanospheres can increase the specific surface area and provide more active sites. The formation of heterojunctions through the modification of NiFe nanospheres on NiMoO4 nanorods can induce changes in their electronic structure. Due to its inherent properties, NiFe-NS/NiMoO4 demonstrates higher performance than commercial RuO2 (which has an overpotential of 228 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2), with overpotentials of 196 and 294 mV at current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8211;2, respectively. The stability of the sample was proved to be excellent during a 50 h stability test. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also indicate that the improved efficiency of the OER can be attributed to controlling and adjusting of the electron structure through heterojunction formation as well as the collaborative impact resulting from NiFe and NiMoO4. The structure enables optimized adsorption of intermediates and facilitates the kinetics of OER, and provides an idea for the design of heterogeneous catalysts.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Role of the Stoichiometry of Atomic Layer Deposited Nickel Cobalt Oxides on the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202405188</link>

                Abstract Nickel cobalt oxides (NCOs) are promising, non&#8208;precious oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. However, the stoichiometry&#8208;dependent electrochemical behavior makes it crucial to understand the structure&#8208;OER relationship. In this work, NCO thin film model systems are prepared using atomic layer deposition. In&#8208;depth film characterization shows the phase transition from Ni&#8208;rich rock&#8208;salt films to Co&#8208;rich spinel films. Electrochemical analysis in 1 m KOH reveals a synergistic effect between Co and Ni with optimal performance for the 30 at.% Co film after 500 CV cycles. Electrochemical activation correlates with film composition, specifically increasing activation is observed for more Ni&#8208;rich films as its bulk transitions to the active (oxy)hydroxide phase. In parallel to this transition, the electrochemical surface area (ECSA) increases up to a factor 8. Using an original approach, the changes in ECSA are decoupled from intrinsic OER activity, leading to the conclusion that 70 at.% Co spinel phase NCO films are intrinsically the most active. The studies point to a chemical composition dependent OER mechanism: Co&#8208;rich spinel films show instantly high activities, while the more sustainable Ni&#8208;rich rock&#8208;salt films require extended activation to increase the ECSA and OER performance. The results highlight the added value of working with model systems to disclose structure&#8208;performance mechanisms.</description>

                Cesium doped WO3 (Cs-WO3) photocatalyst with high and stable oxidation activity was successfully synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method using Cs2CO3 as the doped metal ion source and tungstic acid (H2WO4) as the tungsten source. A series of analytical characterization tools and oxygen precipitation activity tests were used to compare the effects of different additions of Cs2CO3 on the crystal structure and microscopic morphologies. The UV&#8211;visible diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of Cs-doped material exhibited a significant red shift in the absorption edge with new shoulders appearing at 440&#8211;520 nm. The formation of an oxygen vacancy was confirmed in Cs-WO3 by the EPR signal, which can effectively regulate the electronic structure of the catalyst surface and contribute to improving the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The photocatalytic OER results showed that the Cs-WO3-0.1 exhibited the optimal oxygen precipitation activity, reaching 58.28 &#181;mol at 6 h, which was greater than six times higher than that of WO3-0 (9.76 &#956;mol). It can be attributed to the synergistic effect of the increase in the conduction band position of Cs-WO3-0.1 (0.11 V) and oxygen vacancies compared to WO3-0, which accelerate the electron conduction rate and slow down the rapid compounding of photogenerated electrons&#8211;holes, improving the water-catalytic oxygen precipitation activity of WO3.</description>

                The key to enhancing water electrolysis efficiency lies in selecting highly efficient catalysts. Currently, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are utilized in electrocatalysis applications owing to their diverse elemental composition, disordered elemental distribution, and the high solubility of each element, endowing them with excellent catalytic performance. The experiments were conducted using isoatomic FeNiCrMo HEA as a precursor, with a high-activity three-dimensional nanoporous structure rapidly synthesized via electrochemical one-step dealloying in a choline chloride-thiourea (ChCl-TU) deep eutectic solvent (DES). The results indicate that the dealloyed Fe</description>

                Mixed metal oxides (MMOs) are a promising class of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Despite their importance for sustainable energy schemes, our understanding of relevant reaction pathways, catalytically active sites, and synergistic effects is rather limited. Here, we applied synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to explore the evolution of the amorphous Co-Cu-W MMO electrocatalyst, shown previously to be an efficient bifunctional OER and HER catalyst for water splitting. Ex situ XAS measurements provided structural environments and the oxidation state of the metals involved, revealing Co</description>

                Abstract High&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted significant attention for electrocatalytic energy conversion by virtue of their promisingly high efficiency, stability, and low cost. Recently, encouraging progress has been made in tuning the structure and composition of HEAs used in electrolyzers and fuel cells. However, the understanding on the synthetic methods and the structure&#8208;property&#8208;performance relationship of well&#8208;defined HEAs nanostructures is still inadequate. To gain insight into the future research directions on HEAs for electrocatalysis, in this paper, the synthetic methods commonly used to obtain well&#8208;defined HEAs nanostructures (0D nanoparticles, 1D nanowires, 2D nanosheets/nanoplates, 3D nanoporous structures, and other three&#8208;dimensional morphologies) are first summarized. Then, the authors discuss the application of well&#8208;defined HEAs nanostructures in several typical electrocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, alcohol oxidation reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, and formic acid oxidation reaction. Finally, a practical perspective on the future research directions on well&#8208;defined HEAs nanostructured electrocatalysts is provided.</description>

      <title>Direct Current Pulse Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jet Treatment on Electrochemically Deposited NiFe/Carbon Paper and Its Potential Application in an Anion-Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>

                An atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) is used to process electrochemically deposited NiFe on carbon paper (NiFe/CP). The reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONs) of the APPJ modify the surface properties, chemical bonding types, and oxidation states of the material at the self-sustained temperature of the APPJ. The APPJ treatment further enhances the hydrophilicity and creates a higher disorder level in the carbon material. Moreover, the metal carbide bonds of NiFe/CP formed in the electrochemical deposition (ED) process are converted to metal oxide bonds after APPJ processing. The potential application of APPJ treatment on NiFe/CP in alkaline water electrolysis is demonstrated. With more oxygen-containing species and better hydrophilicity after APPJ treatment, APPJ-treated NiFe/CP is applied as the electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline water electrolysis. APPJ-treated NiFe/CP is also used in a custom-made anion-exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE); this should contribute toward realizing the practical large-scale application of AEM for hydrogen production.</description>

                Carbon Dots (CDs) have gained significant attention for their fascinating optical properties, potential applications, and puzzling structural challenges. In the last decade, CDs have become the focal point in many photocatalysis studies, either as independent systems or combined with other established photocatalysts. CDs play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of heterostructures for overall water splitting, hydrogen (HER), and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In these "Concepts," we briefly explore the structure of CDs, highlighting their critical aspects, including their role within heterostructures, composition, the presence of fluorophores, and the interaction between the graphitic core and surface functional groups. We will also examine how these factors impact their photocatalytic properties, particularly in the context of future research on H&#8322; production.</description>

                Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are an innovative class of crystalline porous polymers composed of light elements such as C, N, O, etc., linked by covalent bonds. The distinctive properties of COFs, including designable building blocks, large specific surface area, tunable pore size, abundant active sites, and remarkable stability, have led their widespread applications in electrocatalysis. In recent years, COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts have made remarkable progress in various electrocatalytic fields, including the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, nitrogen reduction reaction, nitrate reduction reaction, and carbon dioxide reduction reaction. This review begins with an introduction to the design and synthesis strategies employed for COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts. These strategies include heteroatom doping, metalation of COF and building monomers, encapsulation of active sites within COF pores, and the development of COF&#8208;based derived materials. Subsequently, a systematic overview of the recent advancements in the application of COF&#8208;based catalysts in electrocatalysis is presented. Finally, the review discusses the main challenges and outlines possible avenues for the future development of COF&#8208;based electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Surface atomic bidirectional migration modulated electrocatalytic activity in Co2MnO4 nanoparticles</title>

                Polymetallic cationic spinel-type oxides are increasingly being used as catalysts for oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER). Here, we have modified the anti-spinel Co2MnO4 using a quenching strategy (CMO-Q) and demonstrated that the bidirectional migration of Co and Mn cations at the tetrahedral/octahedral positions is the essential reason for enhancing the ORR/OER performance. Electrochemical test results show that CMO-Q is better than Co2MnO4, OER initial potential decreased by 100 mV, and ORR current density increased from 4.2 to 7.3 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1600 rpm, with more stable CMO-Q-based zinc&#8211;air battery performance. Meanwhile, density functional theory calculations confirm that the primary factor contributing to the reduction of distance from the d-band center of Co and Mn to the Fermi level is the conductivity enhancement. This study offers insight into regulating the surface atomic migration and catalytic performance of spinel without compromising its stable structure.</description>

                Herein, we construct amorphous molybdenum oxide films by thermal atomic layer deposition (T&#8208;ALD) and plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PE&#8208;ALD). The physical and chemical properties of molybdenum oxide films prepared by the two methods were systematically compared by means of film growth law, atomic force microscope and scanning electron microscope etc. The results show that the amorphous molybdenum oxide physical phase prepared by both atomic layer deposition methods is MoO 3 . Compared with T&#8208;ALD MoO 3 , the growth rate of MoO 3 thin films prepared by PE&#8208;ALD is higher. Compared to PE&#8208;ALD MoO 3 , the MoO 3 films prepared by T&#8208;ALD did not have nucleation delayed to a laminar growth mode, resulting in smoother deposited films and contained less impurity carbon. The MoO 3 prepared by PE&#8208;ALD contains 7.4% impurity carbon. This carbon&#8208;doped film significantly improves the conductivity of the MoO 3 film and shows good electrochemical activity. As expected, the MoO 3 films prepared by PE&#8208;ALD show good electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction. The overpotential was only 259 mV at 10 mA cm &#8208;2 and continued to evolution oxygen for 60 h with almost no attenuation, indicating that carbon doping significantly improves the catalytic intrinsic activity and stability of MoO 3 .

                Titanium (Ti) is widely used as anode current collectors in proton exchange membrane (PEM)-based water electrolyzers due to its self-passivated oxide layer, which protects it from corrosion in acidic solutions. However, the cost of the material and machining process for Ti is high. A wider utilization of water electrolyzers to produce hydrogen could be favored by the use of less expensive coated aluminum (Al) substrates, which could potentially replace high-cost Ti-based components. It is shown here by depositing a pinhole-free oxygen vacancy-rich titanium oxide (TiOx) protection layer by atomic layer deposition (ALD), the corrosion resistance of Al substrates in acidic environments at oxygen evolution potentials can be enhanced. The optimization of the oxygen vacancy concentration is accomplished by tuning the ALD parameters to achieve ideal stoichiometry and conformal coating on rough substrates. The robustness of the coatings was evaluated at high potentials (2.4 V vs NHE = normal hydrogen electrode) in low pH conditions. A low TiOx dissolution rate of the order of &#8764;6 nm year&#8211;1 was observed. By testing under industrially relevant conditions, i.e., high applied voltages (2.4 V) and low pH, an Al loss at around the zero ppb level was achieved using optimized ALD parameters. It is proposed that a 40 nm TiOx coating on Al may be adequate to provide 60,000 h of durability in a PEM water electrolyzer anode current collector.</description>

                Abstract An urgent challenge to the development of rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries (RZABs) is the highly active, durable, and low&#8208;cost catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (ORR and OER). Herein, a carbon&#8208;based monolithic catalyst is designed via anchoring P&#8208;modified MnCo 2 O 4 inverse spinel nanoparticles on biomass&#8208;derived carbon (P&#8208;MnCo 2 O 4 @PWC). The introduction of surface P atoms regulates the electronic structures and valences of metal atoms by adjusting the coordination fields by (P&#8208;O) &#948;&#8211; and Metal&#8208;P. The optimization of the adsorption behavior of key intermediates facilitates the activation and conversion of reaction species. The monolithic structure is beneficial to the construction of a three&#8208;phase interface for efficient mass transfer and high electrical conductivity. The P&#8208;MnCo 2 O 4 @PWC catalyst displays outstanding bifunctional catalytic properties with a thin &#916; E (the difference between the OER potential at 10 mA cm &#8211; 2 and the ORR halfwave potential) of 0.66 V.

                Herein, we prepare MoS2 and Cu-MoS2 catalysts using the solvothermal method, a widely accepted technique for electrocatalytic overall water-splitting applications. TEM and SEM images, standard tools in materials science, provide a clear view of the morphology of Cu-MoS2. HRTEM analysis, a high-resolution imaging technique, confirms the lattice spacing, lattice plane, and crystal structure of Cu-MoS2. HAADF and corresponding color mapping and advanced imaging techniques reveal the existence of the Cu-doping, Mo, and S elements in Cu-MoS2. Notably, Cu plays a crucial role in improving the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the Cu-MoS2 catalyst as compared with the MoS2 catalyst. In addition, the Cu-MoS2 catalyst demonstrates significantly lower overpotential (167.7 mV and 290 mV) and Tafel slopes (121.5 mV dec&#8722;1 and 101.5 mV dec&#8722;1), standing at &#8722;10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for HER and OER, respectively, compared to the MoS2 catalyst. Additionally, the Cu-MoS2 catalyst displays outstanding stability for 12 h at &#8722;10 mA cm&#8722;2 of HER and 12 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 of OER using chronopotentiaometry. Interestingly, the Cu-MoS2&#8214;Cu-MoS2 cell displays a lower cell potential of 1.69 V compared with the MoS2&#8214;MoS2 cell of 1.81 V during overall water splitting. Moreover, the Cu-MoS2&#8214;Cu-MoS2 cell shows excellent stability when using chronopotentiaometry for 18 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2.</description>

                The sluggishness of the complementary oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is reckoned as one of the major drawbacks in developing an energy-efficient green hydrogen-producing electrolyzer. An array of organic molecule oxidation reactions, operational at a relatively low potential, have been explored as a substitute for the OER. Glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) has emerged as a leading alternative in this context. Additionally, the GOR generates several value-added organic compounds following oxidation that enhance the cost viability of the overall electrolysis reaction. In this study, a low-cost, room temperature operable, and energy-efficient synthetic methodology has been developed to generate unique two-dimensional CuO nanosheets (CuO NS). This CuO NS material was embedded on a carbon paper electrode, which showcased excellent glycerol electro-oxidation performance operational at a moderately low applied potential. Formic acid is the major product of this CuO NS-driven GOR (Faradaic efficiency ~80%), as it is formed primarily via the glyceraldehyde oxidation pathway. This CuO NS material was also active for oxidizing other abundant alcohols like ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, albeit at a relatively poor efficiency. Therefore, this robust CuO NS material has displayed the potential to be used in large-scale electrolyzers functioning with HER/GOR reactions.</description>

      <title>Phosphorus Doping Heterostructure La(OH) 3 @CuO @NF as Advanced Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>

                Abstract Due to the prevailing energy shortages, the quest for new alternative energy sources is growing increasingly urgent. Hydrogen production through water electrolysis has become a crucial method. However, the slow four-electron reaction in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) becomes the main rate-limiting step. In this study, we propose obtaining heterostructure La(OH)3@CuO-P after composite phosphatisation using nickel foam (NF) as the substrate material. The experimental results demonstrate that the heterostructure La(OH)3@CuO exhibits an overpotential of 365mV at a current density of 10mA/cm2 , and displays a Tafel slope value of 114.02mF/dec, a bilayer capacitance of 1.853mF/cm2 for OER in a 1 M KOH solution. After phosphating, the heterostructure La(OH)3@CuO-P exhibits exceptional catalytic performance with only 215 mV overpotential, a Tafel slope value of 79.36 mV/dec, and a bilayer capacitance of 34.73mF/cm2 at a current density of 10mA/cm2 . Moreover, it also exhibits relatively stable performance during cyclic voltammetry testing for up to1000 cycles. Analyses suggest that the formation of a heterojunction structure in La(OH)3@CuO-P effectively addresses the issues of insufficient conductivity of La(OH)3 and tendency for CuO monomer aggregation while maintaining excellent properties for each component. The substitutional P atom doping not only adjusts the electronic structure and optimizes the adsorption free energy of -OH but also reduces sample size and increases catalytic active sites, thereby further enhancing the OER performance of the material.</description>

                Abstract Rapid synthesis of high-entropy alloy nanoparticles (HEA NPs) offers new opportunities to develop functional materials in widespread applications. Although some methods have successfully produced HEA NPs, these methods generally require rigorous conditions such as high pressure, high temperature, restricted atmosphere and limited substrates, which impede practical viability. In this work, we report a laser solid-phase synthesis of CrMnFeCoNi nanoparticles by laser irradiation of mixed metal precursors on a laser-induced graphene (LIG) support with a 3D porous structure. The CrMnFeCoNi nanoparticles are embraced by several graphene layers, forming graphene shell-encapsulated HEA nanoparticles. We provide an in-depth understanding of the laser solid-phase synthesis of HEA NPs on LIG supports by simulation and experimental observations, in consideration of mixed metal precursor adsorption, thermal decomposition, reduction through electrons from laser-induced thermionic emission, and liquid beads splitting. The production rate reaches up to 30 g/h under the current laser setup. The laser-synthesized graphene shell-encapsulated CrMnFeCoNi NPs loaded on LIG supports are used directly as 3D binder-free integrated electrodes and exhibited excellent electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential of 293 mV at the current density of 10 mA/cm2 and exceptional stability over 428 hours in alkaline media, outperforming the commercial RuO2 catalyst and the counterpart catalysts reported by other methods. This work also demonstrates the versatility of this technique through the successful synthesis of CrMnFeCoNi oxide, sulfide and phosphide nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Investigation of an Ethanol Electroreforming Cell Based on a Pt1Ru1/C Catalyst at the Anode</title>

                The production of H2 from renewable sources represents a crucial challenge for the planet&#8217;s future to achieve net zero emissions and store renewable energy. A possible alternative to water electrolysis (WE), which requires high potential (E &gt; 1.48 V) to trigger the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), would be alcohol electrochemical reforming (ER), which implies the oxidation of short organic molecules such as methanol or ethanol. In ER, energy must be supplied to the system, but from a thermodynamic point of view, the energy request for the methanol or ethanol oxidation reaction is much lower than that of the OER. To study this process, an in-house 50 wt.% Pt1Ru1/C anodic catalyst was easily synthesized according to the Pt sulphite complex route and the impregnation of a carbon support (Ketjenblack, KB) and a Ru precursor. X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the structure, composition, and morphology of the catalyst. It appears that two distinct crystallographic phases of the Pt and Ru nanoparticles were encountered after the synthesis conducted by Ru impregnation. For the electrochemical measurements, ethanol electrooxidation (2 M CH3CH2OH) was studied first in a half cell with a rotating disc electrode (RDE) configuration under acid conditions and then in a direct ethanol electroreforming (or electrolysis) cell, equipped with a proton exchange membrane (PEM) as the electrolyte. The output current density was 0.93 A cm&#8722;2 at 1 V and 90 &#176;C in 2 M ethanol. The remarkable current densities obtained in the alcohol electrolyzer at a low voltage are better than the actual state of the art for PEM ethanol ER.</description>

      <title>Chemical evolution of Complex Organic Molecules in turbulent protoplanetary disks: Effect of stochastic UV irradiation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stae1589</link>
      <description>Taiki Suzuki, Kenji Furuya, Yuri Aikawa, Toshikatsu Shibata, Liton Majumdar, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400223606

                Abstract We investigate the chemical evolution of complex organic molecules (COMs) in turbulent disks using gas-ice chemical reaction network simulations. We trace trajectories of dust particles considering advection, turbulent diffusion, gas drag, and vertical settling, for 106 yrs in a protoplanetary disk. Then, we solve a gas-ice chemical reaction network along the trajectories and obtain the temporal evolution of molecular abundances. We find that the COM abundances in particles can differ by more than two orders of magnitude even when the UV fluence (i.e., the time integral of UV flux) received by the particles are similar, suggesting that not only the UV fluence but also the time variation of the UV flux does matter for the evolution of COMs in disks. The impact of UV fluence on molecular abundances differs between oxygen-bearing and nitrogen-bearing COMs. While higher UV fluence results in oxygen being locked into CO2, leading to reduced abundances of oxygen-bearing COMs such as CH3OCH3, mild UV exposure can promote their formation by supplying the precursor radicals. On the other hand, nitrogen is not locked up into specific molecules, allowing the formation of nitrogen-bearing COMs, particularly CH3NH2, even for the particle that receives the higher UV fluence. We also find that the final COM abundances are mostly determined by the inherited abundances from the protostellar core when the UV fluence received by dust particles is less than a critical value, while they are set by both the inherited abundances and the chemistry inside the disk at higher UV fluence.</description>

                Oxygen vacancies are prevalent in metal compounds and play a significant role in the activation of peroxomonosulfate (PMS) to mitigate water pollution. However, how to easily construct these oxygen vacancies and elucidate the mechanism of PMS activation by oxygen vacancies are still pending research and solution. This study presents the synthesis of a NiCoAl-LDH/Kaolin (NiCoAl-LDH/Kao) hybrid catalyst with quasi-2D layer structures morphology and abundant oxygen vacancies (OVs) for activating peroxymonosulfate (PMS). We proposed an intriguing phase transformation from NiCo-carbonate hydroxide (CH) to NiCoAl-layered double hydroxide (LDH), and elucidated the morphological evolution mechanism from nanorod to nanosheet structures through alkaline etching. The NiCoAl-LDH/Kao-PMS system exhibited excellent rapid kinetics and removal efficiency of norfloxacin (NOR), degrading 92.0 % of NOR within 10 min and achieving a final degradation rate of 97.2 %, along with remarkable reusability performance of the NiCoAl-LDH/Kao catalyst. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species including sulfate radical (SO4&#8722;), hydroxyl radical (OH), superoxide anion (O2&#8722;) and singlet oxygen (1O2) were found to be involved in the degradation process of NOR, and the degree of activity of the active groups from strong to weak is 1O2, SO4&#8722;, O2&#8722; and OH. The activation mechanism and conceivable degradation pathways of NOR were experimentally studied and proposed, and the toxicity of degradation intermediates was evaluated. The facile preparation method for NiCoAl-LDH/Kao nanocomposite holds potential for large-scale manufacturing in organic pollutant remediation, while also providing new insights on the indispensable role of OVs in heterogeneous catalysis.</description>

                Abstract A geologically rapid Neoproterozoic oxygenation event is commonly linked to the appearance of marine animal groups in the fossil record. However, there is still debate about what evidence from the sedimentary geochemical record&#8212;if any&#8212;provides strong support for a persistent shift in surface oxygen immediately preceding the rise of animals. We present statistical learning analyses of a large dataset of geochemical data and associated geological context from the Neoproterozoic and Palaeozoic sedimentary record and then use Earth system modelling to link trends in redox-sensitive trace metal and organic carbon concentrations to the oxygenation of Earth&#8217;s oceans and atmosphere. We do not find evidence for the wholesale oxygenation of Earth&#8217;s oceans in the late Neoproterozoic era. We do, however, reconstruct a moderate long-term increase in atmospheric oxygen and marine productivity. These changes to the Earth system would have increased dissolved oxygen and food supply in shallow-water habitats during the broad interval of geologic time in which the major animal groups first radiated. This approach provides some of the most direct evidence for potential physiological drivers of the Cambrian radiation, while highlighting the importance of later Palaeozoic oxygenation in the evolution of the modern Earth system.</description>

                Research findings can offer data and a theoretical framework for a quantitative examination of the bentonite dehydration mechanism. The reasons for changes in pore&#8217; water under the influence of gamma rays in vacuum and in the presence of oxygen was discussed using TGA and DTA, FT-IR spectroscopy. It was revealed that dehydration and pore characteristics are mutually dependent. A question about the associated evolution of dehydration pore&#8216;s water in nanostructured sodium &#8211; bentonite clay under the influence of ionizing rays with and without oxygen has been comparatively studied. The article is devoted to a discussion of how ionizing radiation, passing through nanoclays, produces, or rather begins to produce, chemical effects. It was used Infrared spectroscopy as the method for determining structural responses of natural clay from the Alpoid deposit in the Republic of Azerbaijan, to gamma rays exposure. It was found that under influence of ionizing rays in vacuum obtained hydrogen peroxide. It is of great interest for the study of the dehydration reaction mechanism and its role in formation of H2 under gamma irradiation.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of 3D explosion asymmetries of stripped-envelope supernovae by nebular line profiles</title>

                Abstract Understanding the explosion mechanism and hydrodynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae is a long-standing quest in astronomy. The asymmetries caused by the explosion are encoded into the line profiles which appear in the nebular phase of the SN evolution &#8211; with particularly clean imprints in He star explosions. Here, we carry out nine different supernova simulations of He-core progenitors, exploding them in 3D with parametrically varied neutrino luminosities using the Prometheus-HotB code, hydrodynamically evolving the models to the homologeous phase. We then compute nebular phase spectra with the 3D NLTE spectral synthesis code ExTraSS (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator). We study how line widths and shifts depend on progenitor mass, explosion energy, and viewing angle. We compare the predicted line profile properties against a large set of Type Ib observations, and discuss the degree to which current neutrino-driven explosions can match observationally inferred asymmetries. With self-consistent 3D modelling &#8211; circumventing the difficulties of representing 56Ni mixing and clumping accurately in 1D models &#8211; we find that neither low-mass He cores exploding with high energies nor high-mass cores exploding with low energies contribute to the Type Ib SN population. Models which have line profile widths in agreement with this population give sufficiently large centroid shifts for calcium emission lines. Calcium is more strongly affected by explosion asymmetries connected to the neutron star kicks than oxygen and magnesium. Lastly, we turn to the NIR spectra from our models to investigate the potential of using this regime to look for the presence of He in the nebular phase.</description>

                Abstract The use of solid-oxide materials in electrocatalysis applications, especially in hydrogen-evolution reactions, is promising. However, further improvements are warranted to overcome the fundamental bottlenecks to enhancing the performance of solid-oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs), which is directly linked to the more-refined fundamental understanding of complex physical and chemical phenomena and mass exchanges that take place at the surfaces and in the bulk of electrocatalysis materials. Here, we developed an eReaxFF force field for barium zirconate doped with 20 mol% of yttrium, BaZr 0.8 Y 0.2 O 3-&#948; (BZY20) to enable a systematic, large-length-scale, and longer-timescale atomistic simulation of solid-oxide electrocatalysis for hydrogen generation. All parameters for the eReaxFF were optimized to reproduce quantum-mechanical (QM) calculations on relevant condensed phase and cluster systems describing oxygen vacancies, vacancy migrations, electron localization, water adsorption, water splitting, and hydrogen generation on the surfaces of the BZY20 solid oxide. Using the developed force field, we performed both zero-voltage (excess electrons absent) and non-zero-voltage (excess electrons present) molecular dynamics simulations to observe water adsorption, water splitting, proton migration, oxygen-vacancy migrations, and eventual hydrogen-production reactions. Based on investigations offered in the present study, we conclude that the eReaxFF force field-based approach can enable computationally efficient simulations for electron conductivity, electron leakage, and other non-zero-voltage effects on the solid oxide materials using the explicit-electron concept. Moreover, we demonstrate how the eReaxFF force field-based atomistic-simulation approach can enhance our understanding of processes in SOEC applications and potentially other renewable-energy applications.</description>

                Abstract The spatial distribution profiles of particles in plasma sources push forward our understanding of plasma evolution and physicochemical processes occuring inside. Optical probe methods, such as laser-induced fluorescence, are advanced tools for spatially resolved plasma studies. In our work, we focused on investigation of distribution of neutral Ca and Fe atoms and CaO and FeO molecules in laser-induced plasma by means of laser-induced fluorescence. The development of excitation-emission schemes for Fe and FeO and the practical implementation of schemes for Ca and CaO allowed us to construct distribution maps of these species in laser plasma at 10 and 100 Torr pressures. Both atomic and molecular fluorescence was observed much further from the plasma formation point than the region of bright spontaneous atomic emission. Additionally, by comparing fluorescence intensity distributions with plasma imaging data, we explain the origin of some pecularities in observable plasma inhomogeneity.Distributions of Ca and CaO fluorescence intensity, as well the distribution of CaO/Ca intensity ratio, demostrate that the monoxide is distributed within the plume by the shock wave, but its concentration in the outer layers of plasma is influenced by recombination with atmospheric oxygen.&amp;#xD;</description>

      <title>Consequences for the early evolution of Venus from new simulations of atmosphere erosion by impacts.</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2024-357</link>

                Overview:We investigate how both late accretion and long-term evolution of Venus are affected by early volatile exchanges (outgassing, loss, delivery), using a set of numerical models. In particular, we incorporate new scaling laws of large-impact erosion proposed by Kegerreis et al. (2020), and results of new atmosphere erosion simulations, using the open-source SPH code SWIFT. We assess the conditions and evolutionary pathways consistent with present-day observations of Venus and how to discriminate between late accretion scenarios.Motivation:Due to both the striking similarities and the obvious differences between Earth and Venus, understanding Venus might hold keys to how planets become &amp;#8211; and cease to be &amp;#8211; habitable. The question of the origin and persistence of water in the atmosphere/surface of Venus is directly linked to that of habitability. The divergence between Earth and Venus has been suggested to possibly occur during the first few hundred million years due to interaction between the interior of the planet, its atmosphere and escape mechanisms (e.g. Hamano et al., 2013).General approach:Late accretion impacts constitute both the tail end of the main delivery of material to the planet and, set after the magma ocean phase, the &amp;#8220;initial conditions&amp;#8221; for the planet&amp;#8217;s long-term evolution. It could have important consequences for the distribution of elements, including volatiles. As no sample from Venus is available to constrain ancient history, we turn to modeling.The major constraints on Venus&amp;#8217; volatile evolution come from the present-day state of its atmosphere and its bulk composition. We use different sets of late accretion scenarios and plausible volatile exchange mechanisms (sources and sinks). We compare the atmosphere composition of corresponding evolution models to the present-day state of Venus&amp;#8217; atmosphere. Particularly, we investigate the loss mechanisms (sinks of volatiles) since they impose an upper limit on the amount of volatiles that can be injected into the system while still reaching present-day composition. Required initial conditions are also discussed.Models:Three separate models are used together to investigate volatile exchanges during and following late accretion. Late accretion scenarios are obtained from N-body simulations. They include sequences of collisions with rocky planets leading to scenarios producing Solar System-like configurations and are calibrated using Earth&amp;#8217;s late accretion mass based on the siderophile elements content of Earth&amp;#8217;s mantle (Rubie et al., 2016). We used previously generated scenarios (see Gillmann et al., 2020) to test the consequences of different mass-size distributions on volatile evolution. We include new high-resolution simulations from Joiret et al. (2024), which include tracking 1600 carbonaceous asteroids and 10,000 comets.Long-term evolution, interior evolution and atmosphere bulk composition are tracked using StagYY mantle dynamics models (see Gillmann et al., 2020). Important volatile-exchange mechanisms include volcanic outgassing, thermal and non-thermal atmosphere escape, and gas&amp;#8211;surface chemical reactions through oxidation of fresh lava. Coupling between the interior and the atmosphere is obtained by tracking surface temperature evolution using a radiative convective grey atmosphere model. Impacts affect the atmosphere in three different ways: (i) collisions cause the mantle and surface to melt, releasing volatiles, (ii) impactors deliver volatiles to the atmosphere as they are vaporized depending on their composition, (iii) the impact process leads to atmospheric erosion through a variety of mechanisms.Previous results were obtained using (i) a geometric approach, through the tangent plane model or (ii) using small-impactor results from the SOVA hydrocode (Shuvalov et al., 2014). Here we investigate the importance of constraining impact erosion of the atmosphere by comparing those previous results to more recent larger-impactor scaling laws obtained by Kegerreis et al. (2020). We further include ongoing simulations specifically developed for Venus&amp;#8217; atmosphere compositions and specific collisions defined by the late accretion impact scenarios described above.Results:The tiny amount of water in the present-day atmosphere of Venus limits water delivery from various mechanisms, even when considering water sinks throughout the history of the planet. The maximum amount of water that can be delivered, in turn, governs the estimated overall composition of late accretion impactors, imposing that the bulk of late accretion should be volatile poor.Non-thermal loss mechanisms can account for the loss in the range from 4 mbar up to a few bar of oxygen, depending on assumptions, and over &gt;4 Gyr. Trapping oxygen on the surface through oxidation of newly emplaced volcanic material through solid&amp;#8211;gas reactions appears inefficient (for a total loss similar to non-thermal escape), while recent oxidation of impact ejecta is a comparatively even smaller sink.On the first order, scaling laws extracted from simulations by Kegerreis et al. (2020) imply increased losses for high-energy collisions compared to previous estimates (Shuvalov et al., 2014), but use a different set of assumptions for the investigated atmospheres and consider larger bodies (figure 1). We investigate a series of possible parameterizations to reconcile those results.Figure 1: Loss rates for single impacts calculated from the two sets of simulations described in the text.Using lower atmosphere-erosion estimates leads to similar results regardless of the mass-size distribution of impactors, because the impact delivery of volatiles is the overall dominant effect. On the other hand, strong atmosphere erosion introduces divergences between late accretion scenarios depending on the distribution of impactor sizes, with smaller impactors having a net destructive effect while larger impactors contribute to increasing the atmosphere mass. This effect is not apparent in the water inventory but instead can be seen in the CO2 abundance evolution (figure 2). Therefore, we use CO2, N2 and Ar abundances to further discriminate between possible late accretion scenarios.Figure 2: Evolution of CO2 abundance in the atmosphere from simulations of two scenarios for late accretion. Scenario B includes a few large impactors, scenario D contains a larger number of smaller bodies.References:Kegerreis, J. A., et al. (2020), Astrophys. J. Let. 901.2.Hamano, K. et al.

      <title>Eco-evolutionary Guided Pathomic Analysis to Predict DCIS Upstaging</title>

                Cancers evolve in a dynamic ecosystem. Thus, characterizing cancer's ecological dynamics is crucial to understanding cancer evolution and can lead to discovering novel biomarkers to predict disease progression. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is an early-stage breast cancer characterized by abnormal epithelial cell growth confined within the milk ducts. Although there has been extensive research on genetic and epigenetic causes of breast carcinogenesis, none of these studies have successfully identified a biomarker for the progression and/or upstaging of DCIS. In this study, we show that ecological habitat analysis of hypoxia and acidosis biomarkers can significantly improve prediction of DCIS upstaging. First, we developed a novel eco-evolutionary designed approach to define habitats in the tumor intra-ductal microenvironment based on oxygen diffusion distance in our DCIS cohort of 84 patients. Then, we identify cancer cells with metabolic phenotypes attributed to their habitat conditions, such as the expression of CA9 indicating hypoxia responding phenotype, and LAMP2b indicating a hypoxia-induced acid adaptation. Traditionally these markers have shown limited predictive capabilities for DCIS upstaging, if any. However, when analyzed from an ecological perspective, their power to differentiate between indolent and upstaged DCIS increased significantly. Second, using eco-evolutionary guided computational and digital pathology techniques, we discovered distinct spatial patterns of these biomarkers and used the distribution of such patterns to predict patient upstaging. The patterns were characterized by both cellular features and spatial features. With a 5-fold validation on the biopsy cohort, we trained a random forest classifier to achieve the area under curve(AUC) of 0.74. Our results affirm the importance of using eco-evolutionary-designed approaches in biomarkers discovery studies in the era of digital pathology by demonstrating the role of eco-evolution dynamics in predicting cancer progression.</description>

                Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a cause of bronchial dilatation, associated with rheumatoid lung is rare. This is why we report a case with the aim of discussing the clinical, diagnostic characteristics and therapeutic possibilities of ciliary pathology and showing the link between it and rheumatoid arthritis. Observation: This is a 40-year-old African patient, married without children, from a consanguineous couple, with a family history of a brother who died in adulthood in a picture of respiratory failure and productive cough. She presented with recurrent rhinorrhea since childhood and bronchorrhea in a picture of progressively worsening dyspnea and clubbing. During the evolution of the disease, inflammatory polyarthralgia was associated. The ultrastructural ciliary study by electron microscopy and the measurement of nasal nitrogen oxide are the confirmatory examinations of primary ciliary dyskinesia. They are not achievable in our practice. However, based on the history and clinical findings, the patient presented several elements in favor of this pathology. additional investigations, notably the rheumatoid factor and the chest CT scan, allowed us to suggest rheumatoid lung. Our therapeutic conduct was the administration of antibiotic therapy, oxygen therapy, immunosuppressant, anti-inflammatory and the practice of respiratory physiotherapy. Conclusion: Primary ciliary dyskinesia associated with pulmonary involvement in rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of developing respiratory failure.</description>

      <title>Multi-method characterization of groundwater nitrate and sulfate contamination by karst mines in southwest China</title>

                Groundwater contamination by nitrate and sulfate in mining areas is a significant challenge. Consequently, the inputs sources of these contaminants and their evolution have received considerable attention, with the knowledge gained critical for improved management of water quality. This study integrated data on multiple stable isotopes and water chemistry data and a Bayesian isotope mixing model to investigate the relative contributions of inputs sources of sulfate and nitrate sources to bodies of water in a karst mining area in southwest China. The outcomes indicated that hydrochemical component in the water bodies of the study area is mainly derived from the dissolution of silicate rocks, carbonate rocks and sulfate minerals as well as the oxidation of sulfides. The human and agricultural wastewater, soil nitrogen, and fertilizers were the predominant inputs sources of nitrate to the mine water environment; the predominant inputs sources of sulfide were mineral oxidation, evaporite dissolution, atmospheric deposition, and sewage. Groundwater is mainly recharged from atmospheric precipitation, and surface water is closely hydraulically connected to groundwater. Nitrogen and oxygen isotope composition and water chemistry indicative of nitrification dominate the nitrogen cycle in the study area. The oxidation of pyrite and bacterial sulfate reduction (SRB) had no significant impact on the stable isotopes of groundwater. The results of this study demonstrate the inputs of different sources to nitrate and sulfate in karst mines and associated transformation processes. The results of this study can assist in the conservation of groundwater quality in mining areas and can act as a reference for future related studies.</description>

                Abstract Ammonia fuel cells using carbon&#8208;neutral ammonia as fuel are regarded as a fast, furious, and flexible next&#8208;generation carbon&#8208;free energy conversion technology, but it is limited by the kinetically sluggish ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Platinum can efficiently drive these three types of reactions, but its scale&#8208;up application is limited by its susceptibility to poisoning and high cost. In order to reduce the cost and alleviate poisoning, incorporating Pt with various metals proves to be an efficient and feasible strategy. Herein, PtFeCoNiIr/C trifunctional high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) catalysts are prepared with uniform mixing and ultra&#8208;small size of 2 &#177; 0.5 nm by Joule heating method. PtFeCoNiIr/C exhibits efficient performance in AOR ( J peak = 139.8 A g &#8722;1 PGM ), ORR ( E 1/2 = 0.87 V), and HER ( E 10 = 20.3 mV), outperforming the benchmark Pt/C, and no loss in HER performance at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 for 200 h. The almost unchanged E 1/2 in the anti&#8208;poisoning test indicates its promising application in real fuel cells powered by ammonia. This work opens up a new path for the development of multi&#8208;functional electrocatalysts and also makes a big leap toward the exploration of cost&#8208;effective device configurations for novel fuel cells.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202406483</link>
      <description>Yiwei Wang, Jie Zhang, Yu Wang, Jie Yu, Yijian Gao, Yang&#65533; Yang, Xiliang Li, Hongcheng Wang, Shengliang Li, Advanced functional materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400248100

                Abstract Recent advances are achieved in the design and development of efficient organic photosensitizers (PSs), especially with fluorescence imaging navigation in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700 nm) region. However, there are simply a handful of NIR&#8208;II emissive organic PSs with efficient oxygen&#8208;independent capability due to the scarcity of high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;responsive organic materials and targeted delivery. Herein, a NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emissive organic nanomedicine with biomimetic engineering for high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II imaging and targeted multiple phototherapies of pancreatic tumors is reported. An A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type conjugated small&#8208;molecule TPC is designed and used to prepare water&#8208;dispersive nanoparticles, which demonstrated high efficiency for type I and type II photodynamic performances, good photothermal conversion of 57%, and bright NIR&#8208;II emission with a quantum yield of 9.8% under 808 nm light irradiation. With pancreatic cancer cell membrane camouflage, the biomimetic TPC nanomedicine achieved high&#8208;resolution and targeted bioimaging of whole&#8208;body blood vessels and tumors. Antitumor experiments demonstrated the high efficiency of the biomimetic TPC nanomedicine for pancreatic tumor elimination and good biosafety with 808 nm light irradiation. This work demonstrated a NIR&#8208;II&#8208;emissive versatile nanomedicine with enhanced tumor&#8208;targeting for high&#8208;resolution NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and superior phototheranostics, providing a feasible idea for the evolution of targeted and high&#8208;performance theranostics.</description>

                Comprehensive Summary Facile mass transport channel and accessible active sites are crucial for binder&#8208;free air electrode catalysts in rechargeable flexible zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB). Herein, a ZnS/NH 3 dual&#8208;assisted pyrolysis strategy is proposed to prepare N/S&#8208;doped hierarchical porous bamboo carbon cloth (HP&#8208;NS&#8208;BCC) as binder&#8208;free air electrode catalyst for ZAB. BCC fabric with abundant micropores is firstly used as flexible carbon support to facilitate the heteroatom&#8208;doping and construct the hierarchical porous structure. ZnS nanospheres and NH 3 activization together facilitate the electronic modulation of carbon matrix by N/S&#8208;doping and optimize the macro/meso/micropores structure of carbon fibers. Benefiting from the highly&#8208;exposed N/S&#8208;induced sites with enhanced intrinsic activity, the optimized mass transport of biocarbon fibers, as well as the ultra&#8208;large specific surface area of 2436.1 m 2 &#183;g &#8211;1 , the resultant HP&#8208;NS&#8208;BCC catalyst exhibits improved kinetics for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction. When applied to rechargeable aqueous ZABs, it achieves a significant peak power density of 249.1 mW&#183;cm &#8722;2 . As binder&#8208;free air electrode catalyst, the flexible ZAB also displays stable cycling over 500 cycles with a minimal voltage gap of 0.42 V, showcasing promising applications in flexible electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Functional stress responses in Glaucophyta: Evidence of ethylene and abscisic acid functions in &lt;i&gt;Cyanophora paradoxa&lt;/i&gt;</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/jeu.13041</link>
      <description>Baptiste Genot, Margaret Grogan, Michael J. Yost, Giuseppe Iacono, Stephen D. Archer, John A. Burns, &#152;The &#156;journal of eukaryotic microbiology/&#152;The &#156;Journal of eukaryotic microbiology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400260684

                Abstract Glaucophytes, an enigmatic group of freshwater algae, occupy a pivotal position within the Archaeplastida, providing insights into the early evolutionary history of plastids and their host cells. These algae possess unique plastids, known as cyanelles that retain certain ancestral features, enabling a better understanding of the plastid transition from cyanobacteria. In this study, we investigated the role of ethylene, a potent hormone used by land plants to coordinate stress responses, in the glaucophyte alga Cyanophora paradoxa . We demonstrate that C. paradoxa produces gaseous ethylene when supplied with exogenous 1&#8208;aminocyclopropane&#8208;1&#8208;carboxylic acid (ACC), the ethylene precursor in land plants. In addition, we show that cells produce ethylene natively in response to abiotic stress, and that another plant hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), interferes with ethylene synthesis from exogenously supplied ACC, while positively regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. ROS synthesis also occurred following abiotic stress and ACC treatment, possibly acting as a second messenger in stress responses. A physiological response of C. paradoxa to ACC treatment is growth inhibition. Using transcriptomics, we reveal that ACC treatment induces the upregulation of senescence&#8208;associated proteases, consistent with the observation of growth inhibition. This is the first report of hormone usage in a glaucophyte alga, extending our understanding of hormone&#8208;mediated stress response coordination into the Glaucophyta, with implications for the evolution of signaling modalities across Archaeplastida.</description>

      <title>Tectono&#8208;sedimentary history of the upper Cedar Mountain Formation, Central Utah, &lt;scp&gt;USA&lt;/scp&gt;</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/sed.13211</link>

                ABSTRACT Current investigations into the Albian&#8211;Cenomanian sedimentary record within the Western Interior have identified multiple complex tectono&#8208;sedimentary process&#8211;response systems during the ongoing evolution of North America. One key sedimentary succession, the upper Cedar Mountain Formation (Short Canyon Member and Mussentuchit Member), has historically been linked to various regionally and continentally significant tectonic events, including Sevier fold&#8208;and&#8208;thrust deformation. However, the linkage between the Short Canyon Member and active Sevier tectonism has been unclear due to a lack of high&#8208;precision age constraints. To establish temporal context, this study compares maximum depositional ages from detrital zircons recovered from the Short Canyon Member with that of a modified Bayesian age stratigraphic model (top&#8208;down) to infer that the Short Canyon Member was deposited at ca 100 Ma, penecontemporaneous with rejuvenated thrusting across Utah [Pavant (Pahvant), Iron Springs and Nebo thrusts]. These also indicate a short depositional hiatus with the lowermost portion of the overlying Mussentuchit Member. The Short Canyon Member and Mussentuchit Member preserve markedly different sedimentary successions, with the Short Canyon Member interpreted to be composed of para&#8208;autochthonous orogen&#8211;transverse (across the Sevier highlands) clastics deposited within a series of stacked distributive fluvial fans. Meanwhile, the muddy paralic Mussentuchit Member was a mix of orogen&#8211;transverse (Sevier highlands and Cordilleran Arc) and orogen&#8211;parallel basinal sediments and suspension settling fines within the developing collisional foredeep. However, the informally named last chance sandstone (middle sandstone of the Mussentuchit Member) is identified as an orogen&#8211;transverse sandy debris flow originating from the Sevier highlands, similar to the underlying Short Canyon Member. During this phase of landscape evolution, the Short Canyon Member &#8211; Mussentuchit Member depocentre was a sedimentary conduit system that would fertilize the Western Interior Seaway with ash&#8208;rich sediments. These volcaniclastic contributions, along with penecontemporaneous deposits across the western coastal margin of the Western Interior Seaway, eventually would have lowered oxygen content and resulted in a contributing antecedent trigger for the Cenomanian&#8211;Turonian transition Oceanic Anoxic Event 2.</description>

                Abstract Skin lesions, including skin bacterial abscesses, have become one of the most important health challenges and usually need systemic high&#8208;dose antibiotics. Therefore, it is of particular importance to develop novel approaches for treating this ever&#8208;growing challenge to human health. To address this challenge, herein a copper nanostructure is developed giving combined photothermal and chemodynamic therapies for focal infection treatment. The Cu&#8208;based nanostructures with intrinsic catalytic properties are prepared by D&#8208;L or L cysteine (Cys) as ligand and copper ions. It is shown that the multifunctional copper&#8208;Cys (Cu&#8208;Cys) nanostructures can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and they exhibit near infrared (NIR)&#8208;enhanced catalytic activities to improve ROS production for highly efficient eradication of bacteria. Moreover, the results proved O 2 evolution property of the Cu&#8208;Cys nanoparticles (NPs). The nanostructures show shape&#8208;dependent antibacterial activity where DL&#8208;Cu&#8208;Cys NPs show higher bactericidal performance than L&#8208;Cu&#8208;Cys NPs. In vitro results demonstrate that 2.5 and 1.25 &#181;g mL &#8722;1 of DL&#8208;Cu&#8208;Cys NPs is enough to achieve rapid killing of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) or Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) respectively under 808 nm light irradiation in 10 min. This work introduces a unique photoactive nanoagent to efficiently treat subcutaneous abscess by combining NIR light&#8208;triggered photothermal effect and catalytic generation of ROS without using any antibiotic.</description>

                Morocco is one of the main countries affected in North African with the scorpion envenomations. Faced with the threat, significant morbidity and a major risk of death especially in children, a detailed identification of scorpionic profile of stings remains important for health authorities at national or even regional level. The current study aims to establish the epidemiological, clinical, biological and evolutionary data of the scorpionism by analyzing 383 cases of scorpion stings in children from three age groups (&lt; 1 year, 1-5 years and &gt; 5 years), admitted at the Regional Hospital Hassan II-Agadir in the Souss Massa region during the period of 9 years and 10 months from January 2013 to October 2022. Our results showed that patients under 1 year of age presented the most severe cases and had the highest mortality rate. However, the clinical signs and symptoms observed illustrated severe damages to vital systems, particularly the cardiovascular, neurological and pulmonary systems, although the signs associated with the latter were present only in cases admitted in grades 2 and 3 for the three age categories studied. Fluctuations in vital constants (temperature and peripheral oxygen saturation, blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate), biochemical parameters (ASAT, ALAT, urea and blood creatine, as well as blood sugar) and CBC results revealed major functional disturbances in vital organs, especially in envenomated cases admitted in grade 3. A positive correlation was mentioned between the state of evolution and the various epidemiological parameters, digestive symptoms, as well as signs and symptoms linked to hemodynamic state, general and neurological state. The main interest is to illustrate the seriousness of scorpion envenomations, especially in the high-risk population, for whom an improved therapeutic approach in health centers will undoubtedly be reinforced, and the admission of immunotherapy, as a fundamental part of the treatment, remains important.</description>

      <title>Primary to post&#8208;depositional microbial controls on the stable and clumped isotope record of shoreline sediments at Fayetteville Green Lake</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/gbi.12609</link>

                Abstract Lacustrine carbonates are a powerful archive of paleoenvironmental information but are susceptible to post&#8208;depositional alteration. Microbial metabolisms can drive such alteration by changing carbonate saturation in situ , thereby driving dissolution or precipitation. The net impact these microbial processes have on the primary &#948; 18 O, &#948; 13 C, and &#916; 47 values of lacustrine carbonate is not fully known. We studied the evolution of microbial community structure and the porewater and sediment geochemistry in the upper ~30 cm of sediment from two shoreline sites at Green Lake, Fayetteville, NY over 2 years of seasonal sampling. We linked seasonal and depth&#8208;based changes of porewater carbonate chemistry to microbial community composition, in situ carbon cycling (using &#948; 13 C values of carbonate, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and organic matter), and dominant allochems and facies. We interpret that microbial processes are a dominant control on carbon cycling within the sediment, affecting porewater DIC, aqueous carbon chemistry, and carbonate carbon and clumped isotope geochemistry. Across all seasons and sites, microbial organic matter remineralization lowers the &#948; 13 C of the porewater DIC. Elevated carbonate saturation states in the sediment porewaters ( &#937; &gt; 3) were attributed to microbes from groups capable of sulfate reduction, which were abundant in the sediment below 5 cm depth. The nearshore carbonate sediments at Green Lake are mainly composed of microbialite intraclasts/oncoids, charophytes, larger calcite crystals, and authigenic micrite&#8212;each with a different origin. Authigenic micrite is interpreted to have precipitated in situ from the supersaturated porewaters from microbial metabolism. The stable carbon isotope values (&#948; 13 C carb ) and clumped isotope values (&#916; 47 ) of bulk carbonate sediments from the same depth horizons and site varied depending on both the sampling season and the specific location within a site, indicating localized (&#956;m to mm) controls on carbon and clumped isotope values. Our results suggest that biological processes are a dominant control on carbon chemistry within the sedimentary subsurface of the shorelines of Green Lake, from actively forming microbialites to pore space organic matter remineralization and micrite authigenesis. A combination of biological activity, hydrologic balance, and allochem composition of the sediments set the stable carbon, oxygen, and clumped isotope signals preserved by the Green Lake carbonate sediments.</description>

      <title>N-bearing complex organic molecules in comet 67P</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2024-722</link>
      <description>Nora H&#228;nni, Kathrin Altwegg, D. Baklouti, M. R. Combi, S. A. Fuselier, Johan De Keyser, Daniel R. M&#252;ller, Martin Rubin, S. F. Wampfler, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400290288

                In terrestrial, carbon-based biochemistry, heteroelements such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus play crucial roles as they introduce specific chemical functionalities in organic (hydrocarbon-based) molecules. The debate about the origin and evolution of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere requires a detailed understanding of (1) where and how organic chemical complexity emerges in space and (2) what exogenous materials may have been delivered to the early Earth through impacts, see, e.g., Rubin et al. (2019). Comet studies enable investigation of both aspects as these small bodies possess an organic-rich material record dating back to the earliest history of our Solar System and were an exogeneous contributor of volatile species to Earth (Marty et al. 2017).ESA&amp;#8217;s Rosetta mission visited and accompanied comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (hereafter 67P) for two years and during a large part of the comet&amp;#8217;s orbit around the Sun. Rosetta analyzed the comet&amp;#8217;s chemical composition in unprecedented detail. A key instrument was the high-resolution Double Focusing Mass Spectrometer (DFMS) &amp;#8211; part of the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA; Balsiger et al. 2007). It unveiled a surprising organic chemical complexity: Relying on reference spectra, either calibrated or from the database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, H&amp;#228;nni et al. (2022) showed how the extremely complex cometary mass spectrum is fully deconvolved. After detailed investigation of the pure hydrocarbon species (H&amp;#228;nni et al. 2022) and the O-bearing organic molecules (H&amp;#228;nni et al. 2023), our current work focuses on the N-bearing compounds. The heteroelement N is common in biomolecules such as amino acids and nucleobases and responsible for their characteristic biochemical functionality. To date, only a few N-bearing complex organic molecules have been identified in comets, one of them being the simplest amino acid glycine (C2H5NO2), which was reported by Altwegg et al. (2016) after a targeted search. Here, we present a non-targeted, full analysis of the N- and NO-bearing complex organics and compare them to N-bearing molecules in meteorites, other comets, and the interstellar medium.&amp;#160;Rubin et al.

      <title>Evolution of Mercury's Sulfides in the Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2024-610</link>
      <description>Noah J&#228;ggi, C. Morel, A. Mutzke, C. A. Dukes, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400290674

                Mercury&amp;#8217;s exosphere is sourced from meteoritic and solar radiation interaction with the surface and is therefore a reflection of the soil composition. Curiously, sulfur has not been detected in the exosphere unlike magnesium and calcium [1]. This is despite a strong correlation between sulfur and calcium across the surface [2,3], and with magnesium in the Intercrater Plains and Heavily Cratered Terrain as detected by the X-ray spectrometer (XRS) onboard MESSENGER [4].Defect-mediated diffusion of sulfur in troilite (FeS) and pentlandite [(Fe,Ni)9S8] has been proposed to explain observational and experimental results where a sulfur-depleted layer is capped by a Fe surface layer [5-7]. Unlike the Moon, where FeS grains are known to occur in the regolith [8], Mercury is relatively poor in iron. If the diffusion parameter found for FeS [6] were to be applied to other sulfides, the amount of available sulfur would be reduced by about an order of magnitude [9]. The presence of a metal layer formed by space weathering processes could explain why sulfur was detected by spectrometers observing the surface onboard MESSENGER [2,3,4] but not ejected at rates necessary for exospheric. In J&amp;#228;ggi et al. 2024 it was assumed that all sulfides express a similar sulfur diffusion due to a lack of experimental data. Therefore, in this study, we have used X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy to measure surface sulfur concentrations for oldhamite (CaS) and niningerite (MgS) as a function of incident ion fluence.Sulfide pellets were pressed from powder samples (&amp;#8804;10&amp;#160;&amp;#181;m) in a nitrogen-purged glove tent and transferred to the XPS instrument under low vacuum to prevent atmospheric contamination. These experiments were then simulated using the Binary Collision Approximation (BCA) Monte Carlo code SDTrimSP. In Figure 1 we show the simulated evolution of the surface composition of a CaS pressed-powder pellet, irradiated with 1 keV H+, along with the XPS data. Atmospheric contamination due to oxygen and adventitious carbon leads to an initial surface that is non-stoichiometric. The remnant 15 at% of surface oxygen at fluences &amp;#8805; 1019 ions/cm2 is interpreted to be a result of the rough surface of the pressed powder sample shadowing oxidized inter-granular spaces.Figure 1: Irradiation of oldhamite (CaS) powder pellet with ~3 x 1013 H+/s at 1 keV.&amp;#160; XPS data (dots) and its error, the BCA results without (line) and with diffusion (dashed line; diffusion rate from Ref. 6).Interestingly, our measurements indicate that defect-mediated sulfur diffusion does not occur in CaS as it does in FeS; instead, a near stoichiometric Ca:S ratio is seen at the surface, after removal of adventitious carbon and the oxidized surface. We will present data for MgS and CaS, separately irradiated by H+ and He+, and make informed predictions on the behavior of Mercury&amp;#8217;s sulfides based on our observations and diffusion simulations. In addition to compositional data, we will present changes in morphology (e.g., Fig. 2) and mid infrared reflectivity. For now, we can conclude that the surface depletion of sulfur observed when irradiating iron sulfides is not occurring in CaS. Consequently, a metal surface-layer does not form on CaS and the sputtering of sulfur is not reduced. The non-detection of sulfur in Mercury&amp;#8217;s exosphere is, if tied to low supply of sulfur, likely the result of other processes.Figure 2: SEM image of pressed oldhamite powder before and after irradiation.[1] Grava, C., et al.

      <title>Mineralogy of the mantles in sub- Earths and exo- Mercuries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/epsc2024-1011</link>
      <description>Camilla Cioria, G. Mitri, J. A. D. Connolly, Jean&#8208;Philippe Perrillat, Fabrizio Saracino, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400289459

                The mantle mineralogy of large exoplanets (e.g. super- Earths, planetary bodies having masses between 1-10 ME) has been widely investigated (Duffy et al., 2015).However, the minerals constituting the mantle of Mercury-sized objects (here referred to as exo-Mercuries) and sub-Earths (planetary bodies having masses ranging from 1 MM &lt; 1ME, respectively 1 Mercury-mass and 1 Earth-mass), orbiting closer to their stars, are still underexplored. &amp;#160;This modeling work has focused on describing stable mineral associations in those mantles equilibrated under low values of oxygen fugacity (fO2). Such reducing conditions are not uncommon in stellar systems, as evidenced by various materials in the solar system, ranging from undifferentiated ones (carbonaceous chondrites belonging to the CH and CB groups) to enstatite chondrites, to already differentiated materials like aubrites, and even entire planets like Mercury.Assuming Mercury as a proxy, we employed the open-source software Perple_X (Connolly, 1990) to characterize the mineral assemblages forming the mantle of these reduced planetary bodies.The thermodynamic approach here adopted offers the advantage of allowing the investigation of those planetary interiors otherwise not explorable. Moreover, the employed thermodynamic inputs were extrapolated from known precursor materials, which share several properties with exoplanets under examination. This methodology has already been discussed in literature (N&amp;#233;ri et al., 2020; Cioria and Mitri, 2022), ensuring the validity of this approach. Bulk silicate compositions of aubrite and CH, CB, EN chondrites, have been used as thermodynamic inputs in our simulations. Calculations were conducted within the pressure and temperature ranges suggested for the mantle of Mercury: 1200 K -1700 K and 3 GPa -5 GPa (Tosi et al., 2013).&amp;#160;We found that orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, olivine, and accessory minerals constitute the mantles of Mercury and reduced exoplanets. These results indicate that the initial bulk compositions have a first-order constraint on the resulting mantle mineralogy; more specifically, the initial abundance of SiO2 determines the chemical equilibrium shift between pyroxene and olivine, respectively constituting the dominant phases at high and low silica content. The predicted mantle mineralogy, dominated by pyroxenes, is consistent with that outlined by Putirka and Rarick, (2019) and Putirka and Xu, (2021).The differences with Earth&amp;#8217;s mantle mineralogy are significant, necessitating a new and more appropriate classification of these rocks, as already suggested in Putirka and Rarick, (2019).This outcome holds significant implications for the thermochemical evolution and geodynamics of reduced mantles, also exerting a&amp;#160; substantial influence on the properties of the related&amp;#160; crusts and cores.Future investigations on Mercury, conducted by the ESA BepiColombo mission, could shed new light on the possible mineralogy of its mantle, helping to further detail the minerals stable in those exoplanets formed in similar geochemical contexts.AcknowledgmentsG.M. and C.C. acknowledge support from the Italian Space Agency (2017-40-H.1-2020).References Cioria, C., &amp;amp; Mitri, G.

      <title>Connected FPSOs Thrive on Automation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2118/0724-0040-jpt</link>

                Modern life is connected. Our computers, phones, and watches are all tapped into personal insights, from a daily planner to keep track of meetings and appointments to a health monitor tracking everything from heart rate to blood oxygen level in real time. This connectivity has bled over into many different facets of our lives, including work. Business and industry maintain critical connections allowing for simplification of complex tasks and the monitoring of machines for safety and performance. As the oil field has become more connected, increasing opportunities for automation have been introduced into both new and existing oilfield technologies with aims to achieve new levels of productivity and safety. Whether it is a robotic arm on the drill floor of a rig bringing pipe from the stand to the well or autonomous robots being used for inspections and other operation observations in hard-to-reach or remote places, if the connectivity is there it opens the door to a vast, new toolkit for contractors and operators alike. In 2023, a group of contractors came together to help define the next steps in automation for floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO) vessels. The FPSO Coalition&#8212;made up of SLB, Rockwell Automation, Sensia, and Cognite&#8212;is a collaboration designed to accelerate the evolution of FPSOs by developing and employing new digital capabilities aimed at improving the reliability, availability, safety, and efficiency of the assets, while lowering the carbon footprint of their offshore operations. FPSOs have been invaluable tools for offshore development around the world for decades. Some older hardware does not have the benefit of being wired for connection or pieces of equipment being Internet of Things (IoT)-ready. As much as the coalition looks to solutions to integrate into new facilities, it also explores the limitations and potential for bringing older yet still viable components into the digital age. Under the venture, SLB was tapped to bring advanced digital solutions, subsurface domain expertise, and complex integration and project management capabilities to scale up efficiencies and lower the carbon footprint of operations across every stage of the FPSO life cycle. Rockwell would provide expertise in control and safety systems for FPSOs, as well as extensive experience in power systems. &#8220;Keeping in mind that the typical operating life of an FPSO can be 20-25-30 years, a lot can change in terms of technology, process conditions, regulatory requirements, etc.,&#8221; said Greg Trostel, global industry development manager for floating production at Rockwell Automation. &#8220;But ultimately, the main goal of automation is to ensure the reliable and safe operation of the vessel&#8212;no loss of containment, no personnel at risk, no environmental incidents. &#8220;Ideally, automation systems can adapt and grow with the changing technology and changing requirements. We depend on the automation systems to keep all the individual process modules connected to, and operating in concert with, the main vessel systems,&#8221; he said. One of the first things tasked to the coalition was a contract awarded to SLB for a multipurpose dynamic simulation solution providing an immersive digital twin environment to dynamically simulate operational processes and their control and automation systems, train personnel, and strengthen safety elements at five newbuild FPSO units to be installed in B&#250;zios Field in the Santos Basin for Petrobras.</description>

                On 21st April 2018, the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter began its nominal science phase [1]. Since then, for the last 6 and a half years, the NOMAD instrument has taken more than a 100 million spectra in the ultra-violet, visible and infrared.NOMAD, or &amp;#8220;Nadir and Occultation for MArs Discovery&amp;#8221;, is a suite of three spectrometers: two operate in the infrared and one operates in the 200-650nm range. Of the two infrared spectrometers, &amp;#8220;SO&amp;#8221; is designed primarily for solar occultation observations; and &amp;#8220;LNO&amp;#8221; is primarily designed for nadir observations but can also operate in solar occultation and limb modes [2], and measure Phobos. The ultraviolet-visible spectrometer can do all the above: solar occultation, limb, nadir, and Phobos and Deimos observations [3].The very high resolving power of the infrared SO and LNO spectrometers (~17000 and ~10000 &amp;#160;respectively [4]) mean that they are well suited for measuring atmospheric absorption lines, and are therefore able to measure clouds [5], dust [6], H2O [7], [8], CO [9], [10], CO2 (for temperature and pressure)[11], [12] and HCl [13] in solar occultation mode, plus their isotopes such as HDO [14] and H37CL [15]. SO spectra can also be used to put upper limits on trace gases that are not detected, such as CH4 [16] and HF. In nadir, LNO is primarily measuring H2O [17] and CO [18] in the atmosphere and the albedo/composition of the surface [19], [20]. Work is being done the constrain the potential 2.7&amp;#181;m hydration band in Phobos spectra.The ultraviolet-visible spectrometer, &amp;#8220;UVIS&amp;#8221;, measures O3 and dust/aerosols in both solar occultation [21] and nadir modes [22], in addition to Phobos and Deimos [23]. Of particular note is the ongoing work to observe the limb of Mars during both the day and night, to measure the various airglow emission lines present in the limb spectra [24], [25], [26], [27].Also, calibration efforts are continually ongoing to improve detection limits and retrieval accuracies.In this presentation we will show the latest results from NOMAD, and describe how scientists outside the NOMAD team can also access all the latest data generated by the instrument.&amp;#160;References[1]&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; A.
