      <title>Unveiling the Synergistic Effect of Two-Dimensional Heterostructure NiFeP@FeOOH as Stable Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14080511</link>
      <description>Qinglong Hou, Zhigang Jiang, Chen Wang, Shuhan Yang, Haizhen Liu, Bo Xing, Honghui Cheng, Kuikui Wang, Catalysts. 14(8)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401388575

                Introducing multiple active sites and constructing a heterostructure are efficient strategies to develop high-performance electrocatalysts. Herein, two-dimensional heterostructure NiFeP@FeOOH nanosheets supported by nickel foam (NF) are prepared by a hydrothermal&#8211;phosphorization&#8211;electrodeposition process. The synthesis of self-supporting heterostructure NiFeP@FeOOH nanosheets on NF increases the specific surface region, while bimetallic phosphide realizes rapid charge transfer, improving the electron transfer rate. The introduction of FeOOH and the construction of a heterostructure result in a synergistic effect among the components, and the surface-active sites are abundant. In situ Raman spectroscopy showed that the excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance was due to reconstruction-induced hydroxyl oxide, which achieved a multi-active site reaction. The NiFeP@FeOOH/NF electrocatalytic activity was then significantly improved. The findings indicate that in a 1.0 M KOH alkaline solution, NiFeP@FeOOH/NF showed an OER overpotential of 235 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 46.46 mV dec&#8722;1, and it worked stably at 50 mA cm&#8722;2 for 80 h. This research proves that constructing heterostructure and introducing FeOOH are of great significance to the study of the properties of OER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Upcycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes to Heterostructured Electrocatalysts for Stable Direct Seawater Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202410396</link>
      <description>Zhen Li, Mengting Li, Yiqun Chen, Xucun Ye, Mengjie Liu, Lawrence Yoon Suk Lee, Angewandte Chemie International Edition. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401421568

                The pursuit of carbon&#8208;neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni&#8208;based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine&#8208;rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2 catalyst interfaced with laser&#8208;ablated LiFePO4 (Ni(OH)2/L&#8208;LFP), derived from spent Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO43&#8211; species, formed around L&#8208;LFP, effectively repels Cl&#8722; ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion. Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe3(PO4)2 enhances OH&#8211; adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3 % activity loss after 600 h at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high&#8208;performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.</description>

      <description>Gul Afshan, Suhana Karim, Kothandaraman Ramanujam, Tengku Norazman Tengku Abd Aziz, Sukanta Saha, Soumyabrata Roy, Arnab Dutta, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401422799

                Abstract This work illustrates the practicality and economic benefits of employing a hetero&#8208;interfaced electrocatalyst (CoS 2 @CoFe&#8208;LDH), containing cobalt sulphide and iron&#8208;cobalt double&#8208;layer hydroxide for large&#8208;scale hydrogen generation. Here, the rational synthesis and detailed characterization of the CoS 2 @CoFe&#8208;LDH material to unravel its unique heterostructure are essayed. The CoS 2 @CoFe&#8208;LDH operates as a bifunctional electrocatalyst to trigger both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline seawater (pH 14.0) while showcasing low overpotential requirement for HER (311 mV) and OER (450 mV) at 100 mA cm &#8722; 2 current density. The identical CoS 2 @CoFe&#8208;LDH on either electrode in an H&#8208;cell setup results in simultaneous H 2 and O 2 production from seawater with a &#8776;98% Faradaic efficiency with an applied potential of 1.96V@100 mA cm &#8722; 2 . Next, this CoS 2 @CoFe&#8208;LDH catalyst is deployed on both sides of a membrane electrode assembly in a one&#8208;stack electrolyzer, which retains the intrinsic bifunctional reactivity of the catalyst to generate H 2 and O 2 in tandem from alkaline seawater with an impeccable energy efficiency (50 kWh kg &#8722;1 &#8208;of&#8208;H 2 ). This electrolyzer assembly can be directly linked with a Si&#8208;solar cell to produce truly green hydrogen with a solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen generation efficiency of 15.88%, highlighting the potential of this converting seawater to hydrogen under solar irradiation.</description>

                Fe has been reported to play a crucial role in improving the catalytic activity and stability of Ni/Co-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while the Fe effect remains intangible. Here, we design several experiments to identify the activity and stability improvement using porous anodized nickel foam (ANF) as the electrode and 1.0 M KOH containing 1000 &#956;M Fe(III) ions as the electrolyte. Systematic investigations reveal that Ni sites serve as hosts to capture Fe ions to create active FeNi-based intermediates on the surface of ANF to improve the OER activity significantly, and Fe ions regulate catalytic equilibrium and maintain the stability for a long time. The system exhibits 242 and 343 mV overpotentials to reach 10 and 1000 mA cm</description>

      <title>Achieving Efficient Oxygen Evolution on High&#8208;Entropy Sulfide Utilizing Low Electronegativity of Al</title>

                Abstract Efficient and stable catalysts are in high demand for accelerating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, a high&#8208;entropy sulfide (HES) of (FeCoNiCrCuAl)S@HCS with a 3D structure is successfully prepared by utilizing a simple one&#8208;step solvothermal method and employed as catalyst toward OER. The lower electronegativity of Al compared to the other metal elements and its anti&#8208;corrosion character enable an outstanding OER performance of (FeCoNiCrCuAl)S@HCS with an overpotential of 253 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and an excellent durability after 20 000 CV cycles, outperforming the commercial RuO 2 and most reported metal&#8208;sulfide catalysts. Experiments coupled with theoretical calculations reveal that Al atom primarily serves as electron donor and promotes a redistribution of local electrons from Co and Cr toward adjacent Fe, Ni, and Cu sites. As a result, the Cr&#8208;Al site possesses a lowest energy barrier during the rate&#8208;determining step and works as the dominant active site for OER process. This study provides a novel insight and strategy into structural design and performance enhancement for HES materials.</description>

                Developing energy&#8208; and time&#8208;efficient strategies to derive high&#8208;performance non&#8208;precious electrocatalysts for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), especially stably working at industrial&#8208;demanding current density, is still a big challenge. In this work, a concise molten salt erosion scenario was devised to rapidly modulate the smooth surface of the commercial NiMo foam substrate into the rough, electronically coupled, and hierarchically porous Ni/Fe/Mo(oxy)hydroxide catalyst layer assembled by the nanosphere array. This self&#8208;supported catalyst is super&#8208;hydrophilic for the alkaline electrolyte and distinguished by a balanced Mo leaching/surface&#8208;readsorption process to tune the metal d band center and electronic perturbation. The altered electronic environment with the favored OER intermediate adsorption behavior attains the outstanding OER activity in terms of a very small overpotential of 230.21 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and an ultra&#8208;long stability for 1179.45 h to sustain the initial commercial&#8208;level current density of ca. 1000 mA cm&#8208;2. This superb performance transcends most of the edge&#8208;cutting transition metal peers reported recently and can satisfy the standards of industrial applications. This industrial&#8208;compatible synthesis technology holds profound implications for hydrogen production via water splitting and other electrochemical applications.</description>

                Designing a high-performing iridium (Ir) single-atom catalyst is desired for acidic water electrolysis, which shows enormous potential given its high catalytic activity toward acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with minimum usage of precious Ir metal. However, it still remains a substantial challenge to stabilize the Ir single atoms during the OER operation without sacrificing the activity. Here, we report a high-performing OER catalyst by immobilizing Ir single atoms on a polyimide support, which exhibits a high mass activity on a carbon paper electrode while simultaneously achieving outstanding stability with negligible decay for 360 h. The resulting electrode (denoted as Ir</description>

      <title>Rapid Synthesis of Ruthenium&#8211;Copper Nanocomposites as High&#8208;Performance Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Electrochemical Water Splitting</title>

                Abstract Development of high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost catalysts for electrochemical water splitting is key to sustainable hydrogen production. Herein, ultrafast synthesis of carbon&#8208;supported ruthenium&#8211;copper (RuCu/C) nanocomposites is reported by magnetic induction heating, where the rapid Joule's heating of RuCl 3 and CuCl 2 at 200 A for 10 s produces Ru&#8211;Cl residues&#8208;decorated Ru nanocrystals dispersed on a CuCl x scaffold, featuring effective Ru to Cu charge transfer. Among the series, the RuCu/C&#8208;3 sample exhibits the best activity in 1 m KOH toward both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with an overpotential of only &#8722;23 and +270 mV to reach 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , respectively. When RuCu/C&#8208;3 is used as bifunctional catalysts for electrochemical water splitting, a low cell voltage of 1.53 V is needed to produce 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , markedly better than that with a mixture of commercial Pt/C+RuO 2 (1.59 V). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy measurements show that the bifunctional activity is due to reduction of the Ru&#8211;Cl residues at low electrode potentials that enriches metallic Ru and oxidation at high electrode potentials that facilitates the formation of amorphous RuO x . These findings highlight the unique potential of MIH in the ultrafast synthesis of high&#8208;performance catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.</description>

                Abstract The design of a low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading anode catalyst layer with high activity and durability is a key challenge for a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Here, the synthesis of a novel supported IrO 2 nanocatalyst with a tri&#8208;layered structure, dubbed IrO 2 @TaO x @TaB that is composed of ultrasmall IrO 2 nanoparticles anchored on amorphous TaO x overlayer of TaB nanorods is reported. The composite electrocatalyst shows great activity and stability toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid, thanks to its dual&#8208;interface structural feature. The electronic interaction in IrO 2 /TaO x interface can regulate the coverage of surface hydroxyl groups, the Ir 3+ / Ir 4+ ratio, and the redox peak potential of IrO 2 for enhancing OER activity, while the dense TaO x overlayer can prevent further oxidation of TaB substrate and stabilize the IrO 2 catalytic layers for improving structural stability during OER. The IrO 2 @TaO x @TaB can be used to fabricate an anode catalyst layer of PEMWE with an iridium&#8208;loading as low as 0.26 mg cm &#8722;2 . The low&#8208;iridium&#8208;loading PEMWE delivers high current densities at low cell voltages (e.g., 3.9 A cm &#8722;2 @2.0 V), and gives excellent activity retention for more than 1500 h at 2.0 A cm &#8722;2 current density.</description>

                CoFe-based catalysts are efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. Here, we present a simple one-pot hydrothermal method for synthesizing a series of CoFe glycerates with controllable surface morphologies and investigate their potential as highly efficient catalysts for the OER in alkaline media. These CoFe glycerates exhibit a unique yolk-shell microsphere structure assembled from ultrathin nanosheets. The adjustment of the surface nanosheet size is achieved by varying the CoFe ratio, ensuring a more efficient electrocatalytic system for the OER process. Due to the abundant active sites provided by the yolk-shell structure and interleaved ultrathin nanosheets, Co</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen, a clean resource with high energy density, is one of the most promising alternatives to fossil. Proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers are beneficial for hydrogen production because of their high current density, facile operation, and high gas purity. However, the large&#8208;scale application of electrochemical water splitting to acidic electrolytes is severely limited by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic reaction and the inadequate development of corrosion&#8208; and highly oxidation&#8208;resistant anode catalysts. Therefore, anode catalysts with excellent performance and long&#8208;term durability must be developed for anodic oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in acidic media. This review comprehensively outlines three commonly employed strategies, namely, defect, phase, and structure engineering, to address the challenges within the acidic OER, while also identifying their existing limitations. Accordingly, the correlation between material design strategies and catalytic performance is discussed in terms of their contribution to high activity and long&#8208;term stability. In addition, various nanostructures that can effectively enhance the catalyst performance at the mesoscale are summarized from the perspective of engineering technology, thus providing suitable strategies for catalyst design that satisfy industrial requirements. Finally, the challenges and future outlook in the area of acidic OER are presented.</description>

                Heterogeneous dual&#8208;site electrocatalysts are emerging cutting&#8208;edge materials for efficient electrochemical water splitting. However, the corresponding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism on these materials is still unclear. Herein, based on a series of in&#8208;situ spectroscopy experiments and density function theory (DFT) calculations, a new heterogeneous dual&#8208;site O&#8208;O bridging mechanism (DSBM) is proposed. This mechanism is to elucidate the sequential appearance of dual active sites through in&#8208;situ construction (hybrid ions undergo reconstruction initially), determine the crucial role of hybrid dual sites in this mechanism (with Ni sites preferentially adsorbing hydroxyls for catalysis followed by proton removal at Fe sites), assess the impact of O&#8208;O bond formation on the activation state of water (inducing orderliness of activated water), and investigate the universality (with Co doping in Ni(P4O11)). Under the guidance of this mechanism, with Fe&#8208;Ni(P4O11) as pre&#8208;catalyst, the in&#8208;situ formed Fe&#8208;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst has reached a record&#8208;low overpotential of 156.4 mV at current density of 18.0 mA cm&#8208;2. Successfully constructed Fe&#8208;Ni(P4O11)/Ti uplifting the overall efficacy of the phosphate from moderate to superior, positioning it as an innovative and highly proficient electrocatalyst for OER.</description>

      <title>Nb Doping Induced the Formation of Protective Layer to Improve the Stability of Fe&#8208;Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for Seawater Electrolysis</title>

                Abstract The seawater electrolysis to produce hydrogen is a significant topic on alleviating the energy crisis. Here, the Fe, Nb&#8208;Ni 3 S 2 catalyst is prepared by metal&#8208;doping strategy, and it shows high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in alkaline medium, and only needs 1.491 V to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 in simulated seawater. Using Fe, Nb&#8208;Ni 3 S 2 as a bifunctional catalyst, the two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer only requires a voltage of 1.751 V (without impedance compensation) to drive the current density of 50 mA cm &#8722;2 , and can run over 150 h stably in the simulated seawater. Importantly, In situ Raman test demonstrates that the outstanding performance of Fe, Nb&#8208;Ni 3 S 2 in simulated seawater is ascribed to the in situ formed sulfate protective layer induced by Nb doping, which can effectively inhibit the corrosion of chloride ion, while the protective layer is absent for Fe&#8208;Ni 3 S 2 . The stable operation of simulated seawater electrolysis under industrial current density further confirms the stability improvement mechanism of forming protective layer. In short, this study provides a new strategy of using Nb dopants inducing the formation of protective layer to enhance the stability of seawater electrolysis.</description>

                Abstract This work reports a strategy that integrates the carbon nanotube (CNT) supporting, ultrathin carbon coating and oxygen defect generation to fabricate the RuO 2 based catalysts toward the pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with high efficiencies. Specifically, the CNT supported RuO 2 nanoparticles with ultrathin carbon loricae and rich oxygen vacancies at the surface (C@OV&#8208;RuO 2 /CNTs&#8208;325) have been synthesized. The C@OV&#8208;RuO 2 /CNTs&#8208;325 shows superior activities and excellent durability for the HER. It only requires overpotentials of 36.1, 18.0, and 19.3 mV to deliver &#8722;10 mA cm &#8722;2 in the acidic, neutral, and alkaline media, respectively. Its HER activities are comparable to that of the Pt/C in the acidic media but higher than those of the Pt/C in the neutral and alkaline media. The C@OV&#8208;RuO 2 /CNTs&#8208;325 shows excellent HER durability with no activity losses for &gt; 500 h in the acidic, neutral or alkaline media at &#8722;250 mA cm &#8722;2 . The density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory calculations indicate that the CNT supporting, the carbon coating, and the OVs can modulate the d&#8208;band centers of Ru, increasing the HER activities of C@OV&#8208;RuO 2 /CNTs&#8208;325, and stabilize the Ru atoms in the catalyst, increasing the durability of the C@OV&#8208;RuO 2 /CNTs&#8208;325. More interestingly, the C@OV&#8208;RuO 2 /CNTs&#8208;325 shows great potential for practical applications toward overall seawater splitting.</description>

                In proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts rely heavily on the expensive and scarce iridium&#8208;based materials. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) with lower price and higher OER activity, has been explored for the similar task, but has been restricted by the poor stability. Herein, we developed an anion modification strategy to improve the OER performance of RuO2 in acidic media. The designed multicomponent catalyst based on sulfate anchored on RuO2/MoO3 displays a low overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and stably operates for 500 hours with a very low degradation rate of 20 &#956;V h&#8208;1. When assembled in a PEMWE cell, this catalyst as an anode shows an excellent stability at 500 mA cm&#8208;2 for 150 h. Experimental and theoretical results revealed that MoO3 could stabilize sulfate anion on RuO2 surface to suppress its leaching during OER. Such MoO3&#8208;anchored sulfate not only reduces the formation energy of *OOH intermediate on RuO2, but also impedes both the surface Ru and lattice oxygen loss, thereby achieving the high OER activity and exceptional durability.</description>

                The perovskite&#8208;type oxide (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95Mn0.5Fe0.5O3, synthesized using lanthanum resources recovered from polishing powder waste and manganese resources obtained from zinc anode mud, was prepared via a facile polymer&#8208;assisted combustion method, and further applied in zinc&#8208;air batteries. The crystal phase and microstructure features of the obtained nanoparticles were characterized usingn (XRD), (SEM), (TEM), (XPS), and nitrogen adsorption&#8208;desorption measurements. The results showed that the obtained (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95Mn0.5Fe0.5O3 nanoparticles, with nanoscale size, possess a high specific surface area and a suitable Mn3+/Mn4+ molar ratio, which will benefit both the(ORR) and the (OER). As expected, the thus&#8208;fabricated (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95Mn0.5Fe0.5O3 electrode exhibits a high current density of 71.2 and 85.2 mA cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;0.2 V and 0.6 V vs. Hg/HgO, respectively, which is superior to that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst (58 and 31 mA cm&#8208;2, respectively). Subsequently, this compound oxide can be an air electrode in a rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery. The assembled battery, using (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95Mn0.5Fe0.5O3 as the cathode, exhibits a discharge voltage of 1.05~1.16 V and a charge voltage of 2.03~2.13 V under 15 mA cm&#8208;2 for 150 h. The excellent electrochemical results presented in this study highlight the potential of (La0.8Sr0.2)0.95Mn0.5Fe0.5O3 as a highly efficient and commercially viable bifunctional electrocatalyst for applications in rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Oxygen Evolution Activity for FeCoMn Oxide Catalysts via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/catal14080513</link>

                Electrolytic hydrogen production from water is a promising approach for obtaining clean energy. The development of efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial for the generation of hydrogen through water electrolysis. Transition metal oxides, such as Fe, Co, and Mn, have shown potential as efficient OER electrocatalysts for water splitting. However, accurately predicting their electrocatalytic performance in complex compositional spaces remains a challenge, impeding the precise design of compositions and processes for optimal performance. Herein, a machine learning-based method is proposed for predicting the OER activity of (FeCoMn)Ox catalysts across a wide range of compositions. Physical features that are highly relevant to the OER overpotential (OP) are identified and analyzed. The random forest algorithm is successfully used to establish the relationship between composition and overpotential. The model demonstrates good accuracy in predicting the outcomes of new experiments, with a mean relative error (MRE) of 9.3%. The features based on covalent radius (RC) and the number of electrons in the outermost d orbitals (DEs) are the primary factors. Their variances (&#948;RC and &#948;DE) exhibit a linearly decreasing relationship with the overpotential (OP), providing direct guidance for designing OP-oriented components. This work presents an effective and innovative approach for predicting and analyzing the physical factors of transition metal oxide electrocatalysts, which can enhance the design of highly catalytic materials for electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Surface Defects, Ni3+ Species, Charge Transfer Resistance, and Surface Area dictate the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity of Mesoporous NiCo2O4 Thin Films</title>

                NiCo2O4 has been proven to show high electrocatalytic activity, however facile and inexpensive techniques for preparation of this compound as mesostructured thin film is lacking. In this study, the sol&#8208;gel synthesis of nanocrystalline mesoporous spinel NiCo2O4 thin films by dip&#8208;coating and soft&#8208;templating using the evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly approach is reported. The morphology and crystallographic structure were thoroughly probed by various physicochemical characterization techniques collectively validating the development of uniform mesoporous NiCo2O4 architectures crystallizing exclusively in the cubic spinel phase after calcination in air. The surface area of the thin films depended on the calcination temperature. XPS investigations showed that the amount of Ni3+ and defective oxygen species increased for decreasing calcination temperatures. The overall electrochemical surface area, Ni3+ content, charge transfer resistance, and amount of defective oxygen sites were found to collectively control the oxygen evolution reaction performance. After an optimized annealing procedure at 300&#176;C and chronopotentiometric analysis at 10 mA/cm2 for 1.5 h, a low overpotential of 330 mV vs. RHE at 10 mA/cm2 in alkaline solution was achieved. The results highlight the necessity of precise selection of the appropriate calcination temperature and electrochemical pre&#8208;treatment conditions for adjusting the concentration of electrocatalytically active reaction sites of sol&#8208;gel&#8208;derived NiCo2O4 thin films.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Oxygen Content of Graphene Oxide for Humidity Sensing</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29163741</link>
      <description>Shouxin Zhang, Guocheng Zhang, Fuke Wang, Hong Chi, Molecules. 29(16)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401390527

                Graphene oxide (GO) has shown significant potential in humidity sensing. It is well accepted that the oxygen-containing functional groups in GO significantly influence its humidity sensing performance. However, the relationship between the content of these groups and the humidity sensing capability of GO-based sensors remains unclear. In the present work, we investigate the role of oxygen-containing functional groups in the humidity sensing performance by oxidizing graphite with mesh numbers 80&#8211;120, 325, and 8000 using the Hummers method, resulting in GO-80, GO-325, and GO-8000. Infrared spectroscopy (IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to identify the types and quantification of oxygen-containing functional groups. Molecular dynamics simulation is used to simulate the adsorption energy, intercalation dynamics, and hydrogen bonding of water molecules. Electrochemical tests were used to compare the adsorption/desorption time and response sensitivity of graphene oxide to humidity. It is proposed that hydroxyl and carboxyl groups are the main contributing groups to humidity sensing. GO-8000 shows a relatively fast response time, but the large number of carboxyl groups will hinder intercalation of water molecules, thus exhibiting lower sensitivity. This research provides a reference for the future development of graphene-based sensors, catalysts, and environmental materials.</description>

                The slow oxygen evolution kinetics of iron oxide nanorod arrays have limited their applications in photocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we introduce p-type semiconductor cuprous oxide and further cover cobalt hydroxide ultrathin nanosheets on the surface of both by electrochemical deposition; these methods obviously enhanced the photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting performance of iron oxide nanorods on titanium sheet substrate. The photocurrent of this heterostructure reached 4.8 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) in a 1 M KOH aqueous solution under AM 1.5G illumination, which is much higher than the currently reported photocatalytic water splitting performance of iron oxide nanoarrays. The construction of Fe2O3/Cu2S p-n heterojunction accelerates the separation of photogenerated carriers in the main body of Fe2O3 nanorod arrays; as an excellent oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC), the introduction of Co(OH)x accelerates the kinetic process of interfacial water oxidation leading to the rapid depletion of photogenerated holes, which further improves the charge separation on the photoanode surface. Thus, the synergistic effect between Fe2O3/Cu2S p-n heterojunctions and oxygen evolution catalysts enhanced the iron oxide nanorod array photoanodes.</description>

                Abstract Electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution process must be both active and stable in order to make hydrogen from water using renewable power. Nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layer coated cobalt manganate particles were synthesized on carbon cloth using calcination method. The catalysts exhibited small particle sizes and graphitized carbon layer that covered the cobalt manganate, facilitating electron flow. Moreover, the nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon layer enhanced the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) rate by reducing the potential required for surface reconstruction and optimizing electron distribution on the cobalt manganate surface.

                Atmospheric oxygen levels are traditionally viewed to have been relatively stable throughout Earth's history with several-step increases. Emerging evidence, however, suggests extremely dynamic atmospheric oxygen levels through large swaths of Earth's history. Here, we provide a new perspective on atmospheric oxygen evolution using a dynamical analysis to explore the relative importance of previously proposed feedbacks on the global oxygen and carbon cycles. Our results from a stochastic analysis of oxygen mass balance in this framework suggest there are multiple steady states for atmospheric oxygen, but only three stable states. One stable state under anoxic conditions (&lt;10</description>

      <title>Half&#8208;metallization Atom&#8208;Fingerprints Achieved at Ultrafast Oxygen&#8208;Evaporated Pyrochlores for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202404787</link>
      <description>Zhuangzhuang Xu, Ming Meng, Gang Zhou, Chenglong Liang, Xing&#8208;Tao An, Yuxuan Jiang, Yongcai Zhang, Yong Zhou, Lizhe Liu, Advanced Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401485806

                The stability and catalytic activity of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are strongly determined by the coordination states and spatial symmetry among metal sites at catalysts. Herein, an ultrafast oxygen evaporation technology to rapidly soften the intrinsic covalent bonds using ultrahigh electrical pulses is suggested, in which prospective charged excited states at this extreme avalanche condition can generate a strong electron-phonon coupling to rapidly evaporate some coordinated oxygen (O) atoms, finally leading to a controllable half-metallization feature. Simultaneously, the relative metal (M) site arrays can be orderly locked to delineate some intriguing atom-fingerprints at pyrochlore catalysts, where the coexistence of metallic bonds (M&#9472;M) and covalent bonds (M&#9472;O) at this symmetry-breaking configuration can partially restrain crystal field effect to generate a particular high-spin occupied state. This half-metallization catalyst can effectively optimize the spin-related reaction kinetics in acidic OER, giving rise to 10.3 times (at 188 mV overpotential) reactive activity than pristine pyrochlores. This work provides a new understanding of half-metallization atom-fingerprints at catalyst surfaces to accelerate acidic water oxidation.</description>

      <title>Oxyanion Engineering on RuO2 for Efficient Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>

                In proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), the anode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts rely heavily on the expensive and scarce iridium&#8208;based materials. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) with lower price and higher OER activity, has been explored for the similar task, but has been restricted by the poor stability. Herein, we developed an anion modification strategy to improve the OER performance of RuO2 in acidic media. The designed multicomponent catalyst based on sulfate anchored on RuO2/MoO3 displays a low overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and stably operates for 500 hours with a very low degradation rate of 20 &#956;V h&#8208;1. When assembled in a PEMWE cell, this catalyst as an anode shows an excellent stability at 500 mA cm&#8208;2 for 150 h. Experimental and theoretical results revealed that MoO3 could stabilize sulfate anion on RuO2 surface to suppress its leaching during OER. Such MoO3&#8208;anchored sulfate not only reduces the formation energy of *OOH intermediate on RuO2, but also impedes both the surface Ru and lattice oxygen loss, thereby achieving the high OER activity and exceptional durability.</description>

                Electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation (EAO) is an attractive alternative to the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction in electrochemical hydrogen evolution cells. However, the development of high-performance bifunctional electrocatalysts is a major challenge. Herein, we developed a nitrogen-doped bimetallic oxide electrocatalyst (WO-N/NF) by a one-step hydrothermal method for the selective electrooxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid in alkaline electrolytes. The WO-N/NF electrode features block-shaped particles on a rough, inhomogeneous surface with cracks and lumpy nodules, increasing active sites and enhancing electrolyte diffusion. The electrode demonstrates exceptional activity, stability, and selectivity, achieving efficient benzoic acid production while reducing the electrolysis voltage. A low onset potential of 1.38 V (vs. RHE) is achieved to reach a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte with only 0.2 mmol of metal precursors, which is 396 mV lower than that of water oxidation. The analysis reveals a yield, conversion, and selectivity of 98.41%, 99.66%, and 99.74%, respectively, with a Faradaic efficiency of 98.77%. This work provides insight into the rational design of a highly active and selective catalyst for electrocatalytic alcohol oxidation.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Water Electrolysis Properties of Membrane Electrode Assemblies with Nafion and Crosslinked Sulfonated Polyphenylsulfone Membranes by Using a Decal Method</title>

                To improve the stability of high-temperature water electrolysis, I prepared membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) using a decal method and investigated their water electrolysis properties. Nafion 115 and crosslinked sulfonated polyphenylsulfone (CSPPSU) membranes were used. IrO2 was used as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst, and Pt/C was used as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. The conductivity of the CSPPSU membrane at 80 &#176;C and 90% RH (relative humidity) is about four times lower than that of the Nafion 115 membrane. Single-cell water electrolysis was performed while measuring the current density and performing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at cell temperatures from 80 to 150 &#176;C and the stability of the current density over time at 120 &#176;C and 1.7 V. The current density of water electrolysis using Nafion 115 and CSPPSU membranes at 150 &#176;C and 2 V was 1.2 A/cm2 for both. The current density of the water electrolysis using the CSPPSU membrane at 120 &#176;C and 1.7 V was stable for 40 h. The decal method improved the contact between the CSPPSU membrane and the catalyst electrode, and a stable current density was obtained.</description>

                The implementation of nanocomposite materials as electrode layers represents a potential turning point for next-generation of solid oxide cells in order to reduce the use of critical raw materials. However, the substitution of bulk electrode materials by thin films is still under debate especially due to the uncertainty about their performance and stability under operando conditions, which restricts their use in real applications. In this work, we propose a multiphase nanocomposite characterized by a highly disordered microstructure and high cationic intermixing as a result from thin-film self-assembly of a perovskite-based mixed ionic-electronic conductor (lanthanum strontium cobaltite) and a fluorite-based pure ionic conductor (samarium-doped ceria) as an oxygen electrode for reversible solid oxide cells. Electrochemical characterization shows remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (fuel cell mode) and oxygen evolution activity (electrolysis mode) in comparison with state-of-the-art bulk electrodes, combined with outstanding long-term stability at operational temperatures of 700 &#176;C. The disordered nanostructure was implemented as a standalone oxygen electrode on commercial anode-supported cells, resulting in high electrical output in fuel cell and electrolysis mode for active layer thicknesses of only 200 nm (&gt;95% decrease in critical raw materials with respect to conventional cathodes). The cell was operated for over 300 h in fuel cell mode displaying excellent stability. Our findings unlock the hidden potential of advanced thin-film technologies for obtaining high-performance disordered electrodes based on nanocomposite self-assembly combining long durability and minimized use of critical raw materials.</description>

                Abstract Electrocatalytic water splitting for hydrogen production still faces a bottleneck due to sluggish reactive kinetics and high reactive energy barriers. Herein, p&#8211;d orbital coupling P&#8211;Fe heterosites are constructed at Ni 2 P&#8211;FeNi&#8208;LDH interfaces to enhance the O&#9472;H bond cleavage of reaction intermediates H 2 O* and OH* for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. The Ni 2 P/NiFe&#8208;LDH heterostructure shows superior HER and OER activities for alkaline water splitting with overpotentials of 230 and 270 mV at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 , respectively, and even exhibits high activity for electrocatalytic alkaline seawater splitting. The interaction of P 2p and Fe 3d orbitals at Ni 2 P&#8211;FeNi&#8208;LDH interfaces upshifts the d&#8208;band center of Fe and downshifts the p&#8208;band center of P. This finding not only facilitates the dissociation of O&#9472;H bonds in H 2 O and promotes the Volmer&#8211;Heyrovsky step for HER, but also reduces the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of OER from OH* to O* transition. This work proposes a new approach to constructing p&#8211;d heterosites at heterojunctions to facilitate reactive kinetics and reduce the energy barrier for electrocatalysis.</description>

                Abstract Among various products from electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction (CO 2 ER), HCOOH is highly profitable one. However, the slow kinetics of anodic oxygen evolution reaction lowers overall energy efficiency, which can be replaced by an electro&#8208;oxidation reaction with low thermodynamic potential and fast kinetics. Herein, we report an electrolysis system coupling CO 2 ER with 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR). A BiOCl&#8211;CuO catalyst was designed to sustain CO 2 ER to HCOOH at partial current density of 500 mA/cm 2 with FE HCOOH above 90% and 700 mA/cm 2 with FE HCOOH above 80%. In situ and ex situ x&#8208;ray absorption fine structure was used to capture the structure transform of BiOCl&#8211;CuO into metallic Bi and Cu during CO 2 ER process, and the presence of CuO will promote this transformation which are supported by DFT calculations. Coupling HMFOR with CO 2 ER, we realize both FE HCOOH and FE FDCA above 95% simultaneously, providing new prospects vista for the electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added products from paired system.</description>

                ABSTRACT. This investigation delineates the fabrication, comprehensive characterization, and electrochemical evaluation of a one-dimensional Cobalt-based Metal-Organic Framework (Co-MOFs), constructed from 4,4&#8217;-Bipyridine ligands and Cobalt (II) ions. The study aimed to perfect the synthesis protocol, elucidate the structural and compositional attributes of the resultant MOF, and probe its electrochemical performance. Utilizing the reflux method, renowned for its efficacy and eco-compatibility, we synthesized the MOF and affirmed its formation through a suite of analytical techniques, including Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), and electrical conductivity measurements. The synthesized Co-MOFs, chemically notated as [Co2(4,4'-bpy)2(SO4)(H2O)2]SO4&#183;H2O, manifested as a one-dimensional coordination polymer. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis unveiled its monoclinic crystallinity within the C2 space group. Electrochemical characterization uncovered a reversible redox system, evidenced by a robust peak current ratio (IPa/IPc = 7.5), indicative of efficient electron transfer processes. Furthermore, the Co-MOFs significantly augmented the kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in an alkaline aqueous solution, highlighting its potential as a superior catalyst in energy-related electrochemical applications. This work not only contributes to the field of MOF synthesis but also sets the stage for future explorations into their practical applications in sustainable energy systems.

                Abstract Green and sustainable energy alternatives to replace fossil fuels are a topic of research in scientific community, thus yielding pursuit of advancing renewable energy systems with hydrogen emerging as a suitable and viable alternative. Efficient and non&#8208;precious metal catalysts are crucial for large&#8208;scale electrochemical water splitting yielding clean H 2 . Here, a novel two&#8208;step hydrothermal synthesis approach to fabricate manganese&#8211;cobalt selenide nano&#8208;cubes grown directly on nickel foam (NF) (MnCo 2 Se 4 /NF) is adopted. Leveraging its hierarchically structured architecture, augmented active sites, and electrochemically active surface area, MnCo 2 Se 4 /NF material demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic performance for both water oxidation and reduction. With an overpotential of 233 mV for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 187 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction at a current density of 10 mA/cm 2 , MnCo 2 Se 4 /NF also exhibits a Tafel slope of 44 mV/dec for sluggish OER process. Notably, this nanocrystalline catalyst displays enhanced catalytic activity under alkaline conditions, accelerates water dissociation, and maintains good stability over 50 h. Outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art RuO 2 , particularly in two&#8208;electrode assemblies with an overpotential of 218 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 , this work offers a promising pathway for designing and manufacturing of innovative bifunctional electrocatalysts for efficient water splitting processes, thereby contributing to broader goal of sustainable energy production.</description>

                Abstract The development of efficient, robust, and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts remains a significant challenge for practical water electrolysis. Here, a metallic glass (MG)&#8208;based catalyst with surface&#8208;enriched Ir and Pt&#8208;alloyed active sites, demonstrating superior electrocatalytic performance, is reported. The dealloyed catalyst, characterized by an Ir and Pt&#8208;rich honeycombed nanoporous surface and an interior flexible MG substrate, can directly serve as a bifunctional electrode, enabling efficient hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions with low overpotentials of 19 and 223 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , respectively. Notably, the mass activity of the catalyst surpasses that of commercial Pt/C and Ir/C catalysts by 13.9 and 16.5 times, respectively. Additionally, the catalyst exhibits exceptional stability with negligible activity decay even under an ampere&#8208;level current density (i.e., &#8805;1 A cm &#8722;2 ). Theoretical calculations reveal the optimization of atomic configuration and regulation of electronic interactions through lattice strain induced by the co&#8208;alloying of Ir and Pt, contributing to superior electrocatalytic performance. Furthermore, the unique honeycombed nanoporous architecture, shaped by the surface migration and enrichment of the noble metals, offers abundant active sites for accelerating the electrocatalytic reactions. This work presents a novel approach to cost&#8208;effectively design high&#8208;performance alloy catalysts by engineering surface catalytically active sites.</description>

      <title>Upcycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes to Heterostructured Electrocatalysts for Stable Direct Seawater Splitting</title>

                The pursuit of carbon&#8208;neutral energy has intensified the interest in green hydrogen production from direct seawater electrolysis, given the scarcity of freshwater resources. While Ni&#8208;based catalysts are known for their robust activity in alkaline water oxidation, their catalytic sites are prone to rapid degradation in the chlorine&#8208;rich environments of seawater, leading to limited operation time. Herein, we report a Ni(OH)2 catalyst interfaced with laser&#8208;ablated LiFePO4 (Ni(OH)2/L&#8208;LFP), derived from spent Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), as an effective and stable electrocatalyst for direct seawater oxidation. Our comprehensive analyses reveal that the PO43&#8211; species, formed around L&#8208;LFP, effectively repels Cl&#8722; ions during seawater oxidation, mitigating corrosion. Simultaneously, the interface between in situ generated NiOOH and Fe3(PO4)2 enhances OH&#8211; adsorption and electron transfer during the oxygen evolution reaction. This synergistic effect leads to a low overpotential of 237 mV to attain a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and remarkable durability, with only a 3.3 % activity loss after 600 h at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline seawater. Our findings present a viable strategy for repurposing spent LIBs into high&#8208;performance catalysts for sustainable seawater electrolysis, contributing to the advancement of green hydrogen production technologies.</description>

                Abstract NiFe&#8208;based nanomaterials are extensively studied as one of the promising candidates for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, their practical application is still largely impeded by the unsatisfied activity and poor durability caused by the severe leaching of active species. Herein, a rapid and facile combustion method is developed to synthesize the vertical graphene (VG) supported N&#8208;doped carbon modified (Ni x Fe 1&#8208;x )Se composites (NC@(Ni x Fe 1&#8208;x )Se/VG). The interconnected heterostructure of obtained materials plays a vital role in boosting the catalytic performance, offering rich active sites and convenient pathways for rapid electron and ion transport. The incorporation of Se into NiFe facilitates the formation of active species via in situ surface reconstruction. According to density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the in situ formation of a Ni 0.75 Fe 0.25 Se/Ni 0.75 Fe 0.25 OOH layer significantly enhances the catalytic activity of NC@(Ni x Fe 1&#8208;x )Se/VG. Furthermore, the surface&#8208;adsorbed selenoxide species contribute to the stabilization of the catalytic active phase and increase the overall stability. The obtained NC@(Ni x Fe 1&#8208;x )Se/VG exhibits a low overpotential of 220 mV at 20 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 300 h. This work offers a novel perspective on the design and fabrication of OER electrocatalysts with high activity and stability.</description>

                Abstract Oxyapatites A 10 (GeO 4 ) 6 O 2 (A &#8211; alkaline, rare&#8208;earth elements) are considered promising materials for applications in solid&#8208;state lighting and non&#8208;contact thermometry. The temperature dynamics of the oxygen sublattice have a crucial influence on the luminescent properties of these optical hosts. Here, the structural evolution with temperature of germanates with the general formula ALa 9 (GeO 4 ) 6 O 2 (A &#8211; Li, Na, K, Rb) is investigated, using X&#8208;ray and neutron powder diffraction methods. These compounds crystallize in space&#8208;group P 6 3 / m . NPD experiments helped to determine the oxygen and alkaline metal positions. Thermally&#8208;induced reentrant structural transitions relating to the oxygen in the apatite channel are discovered for the first time. In the example of Eu&#8208;doped RbLa 9 (GeO 4 ) 6 O 2 and KLa 9 (GeO 4 ) 6 O 2 , it is demonstrated that the luminescence of the Eu 3+ ion is influenced by small changes in the crystal structure.</description>

      <title>Coupled Numerical Simulation of Coal Failure Caused by Thermal Impacting in Underground Coal Gasification Zone</title>

                ABSTRACT: Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) is an environmentally friendly way to utilize coal resources. The cavity evolution process, especially the thermal impact on coal rock, is an important topic of UCG. The thermally induced coal rock failure processes in gasification environment are rarely investigated, but they are important to the gas production space and the flow from the injection well to the production well. In this study, a coupled numerical simulation program based on PFC3D and FLAC3D was established to realize multi-field coupled thermal impact conditions. The numerical model of burning-induced coal surface failure was established, and the basic cavity evolution mechanism was revealed. The main results show that (1) the redistributed temperature field in the coal rock is the most important parameter for the coupling model. The mechanical properties of the model element are assigned in accordance with its temperature state. (2) Taking into account the effects of heating, microscopic fracture and deformation are generated through PFC3D model, inhomogeneous temperature distribution is simultaneously achieved through FLAC3D model. (3) The evolution law of the expansion of the gasification cavity has been obtained by the coupled numerical simulation. (4) Eventually, the height of the gasification cavity increases, and the upper coal seams expand to an approximate equilibrium, the height affected by the temperature field becomes stable, and the vertical expansion rate of the gasification cavity gradually decreases. 1. INTRODUCTION Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) is a revolutionary technology for clean coal utilization that integrates the three key processes of well construction, coal mining and gasification for efficient gas production. This technology allows coal to undergo controlled in-situ combustion, pyrolysis and gasification reactions to produce syngas with methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and other components for surface recovery by injecting air, oxygen-enriched air, oxygen/water and other gasification agents into underground coal seams[1&#8211;4]. Currently, the underground gasification of middle-deep coal seams has no practical experience, especially for the dynamic study of the deforming and destroying process of the surrounding stone (coal) in the gasification cavity under high temperature and high pressure. The numerical simulation technology of gasification cavity development dynamics is still in the initial stage. The simulation technology of gasification cavity controllable development control is not deep enough, and the analysis of the effect of dynamic process parameters in the process of cavity formation is still insufficient.</description>

      <title>Insights on the Formation Conditions of Uranus and Neptune from Their Deep Elemental Compositions</title>

                Abstract This study, placed in the context of the preparation for the Uranus Orbiter Probe mission, aims to predict the bulk volatile compositions of Uranus and Neptune. Using a protoplanetary disk model, it examines the evolution of trace species through vapor and solid transport as dust and pebbles. Due to the high carbon abundance found in their envelopes, the two planets are postulated to have formed at the carbon monoxide ice line within the protosolar nebula. The time evolution of the abundances of the major volatile species at the location of the CO ice line is then calculated to derive the abundance ratios of the corresponding key elements, including the heavy noble gases, in the feeding zones of Uranus and Neptune. Supersolar metallicity in their envelopes likely results from accreting solids in these zones. Two types of solids are considered: pure condensates (Case 1) and a mixture of pure condensates and clathrates (Case 2). The model, calibrated to observed carbon enrichments, predicts deep compositions. In Case 1, argon is deeply depleted, while nitrogen, oxygen, krypton, phosphorus, sulfur, and xenon are significantly enriched relative to their protosolar abundances in the two planets. Case 2 predicts significant enrichments for all species, including argon, relative to their protosolar abundances. Consequently, Case 1 predicts near-zero Ar/Kr or Ar/Xe ratios, while Case 2 suggests that these ratios are 0.1 and 0.5&#8211;1 times their protosolar ratios, respectively. Both cases predict a bulk sulfur-to-nitrogen ratio consistent with atmospheric measurements.</description>

      <title>Mineral chemistry, petrography and crystallization conditions of the Middle Eocene Kaz&#305;kbeli Pluton (Eastern Pontides, NE T&#252;rkiye)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.19111/bulletinofmre.1529525</link>
      <description>Zikrullah Samet G&#252;lo&#287;lu, Abdullah Kaygusuz, Emre Ayd&#305;n&#231;ak&#305;r, Cem Y&#252;cel, Bulletin Of The Mineral Research and Exploration. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401401513

                The Eastern Pontides host a diverse suite of plutonic rocks spanning a wide range of ages and compositions. Among these, the Middle Eocene Kaz&#305;kbeli pluton, located in the K&#252;rt&#252;n district of G&#252;m&#252;&#351;hane, stands out due to its distinctive petrological characteristics. This study aims to unravel the petrological implications of petrographic and mineral chemical data to constrain the physicayd&#305;n&#231;ak&#305;rochemical conditions (temperature, pressure, oxygen fugacity) under which the Kaz&#305;kbeli magma crystallized and was emplaced. By integrating mineral chemical data, we seek to quantify emplacement pressure, crystallization temperature, and oxygen fugacity. A comprehensive understanding of the genetic relationships and physicochemical properties of the Kaz&#305;kbeli pluton rocks, as determined through geological, petrographic and mineral chemistry, is crucial for elucidating the geological evolution of the Eastern Pontides. The Kaz&#305;kbeli Pluton exhibits a predominant NE-SW orientation and encompasses an area of roughly 46 km&#178;. Modal mineralogical analysis reveals a compositional spectrum ranging from gabbroic diorite to monzogranite, with granodiorite and tonalite being the most prominent rock types. Textural variations encompass fine- to medium-grained, porphyritic, poikilitic, and occasionally graphic textures. The primary mineral assemblage of the pluton comprises plagioclase, orthoclase, quartz, amphibole, biotite, and Fe-Ti oxides. Accessory minerals include zircon, apatite, sphene, and allanite. Plagioclases are labradorite to oligoclase (An26 to An66) in composition. K-feldspar minerals exhibited an orthoclase composition (Or80 to Or97). All amphiboles belong to the calcic amphibole field and exhibit a magnesio-hornblende (Mg#=0.63-0.73) composition. Biotites crystallized as solidified melt products with compositions between annite and phlogopite endmembers, plotting close to the magnesium-rich (Mg#=0.52-0.58) end of the phlogopite solid solution series. Calculated crystallization temperatures derived from amphibole and biotite data range from 712&#176;C to 824&#176;C. Pressure estimations calculated using amphibole-plagioclase, amphibole and biotite suggest a range of 0.04 to 2.06 kbar. Oxygen fugacity (&#402;O2) values calculated using amphibole and biotite fall between -12.5 and -16.1. Amphibole-based water content estimations indicate a range of 3.7% to 5.7% for the pluton. Biotite compositions within the studied Kaz&#305;kbeli pluton rocks exhibit characteristics suggestive of a potential mantle origin. Geobarometric calculations based on mineral chemistry data with geological and petrographic features indicate the emplacement of the Kaz&#305;kbeli Pluton at relatively shallow depths within the crust (~1 to 8 km).</description>

      <title>Concurrent Amorphization and Nanocatalyst Formation in Cu&#8208;Substituted Perovskite Oxide Surface: Effects on Oxygen Reduction Reaction at Elevated Temperatures</title>

                Abstract The activity and durability of chemical/electrochemical catalysts are significantly influenced by their surface environments, highlighting the importance of thoroughly examining the catalyst surface. Here, Cu&#8208;substituted La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3&#8208;&#948; is selected, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), to explore the real&#8208;time evolution of surface morphology and chemistry under a reducing atmosphere at elevated temperatures. Remarkably, in a pioneering observation, it is discovered that the perovskite surface starts to amorphize at an unusually low temperature of approximately 100 &#176;C and multicomponent metal nanocatalysts additionally form on the amorphous surface as the temperature raises to 400 &#176;C. Moreover, this investigation into the stability of the resulting amorphous layer under oxidizing conditions reveals that the amorphous structure can withstand a high&#8208;temperature oxidizing atmosphere (&#8805;650 &#176;C) only when it has undergone sufficient reduction for an extended period. Therefore, the coexistence of the active nanocatalysts and defective amorphous surface leads to a nearly 100% enhancement in the electrode resistance for the ORR over 200 h without significant degradation. These observations provide a new catalytic design strategy for using redox&#8208;dynamic perovskite oxide host materials.</description>

                Converting CO2 to carbon&#8208;based fuels using solar energy via photocatalysis is a promising approach to boost carbon neutrality. However, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency is hampered by interconnected multiple factors including insufficient light absorption, low separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers as well as complex and sluggish surface reaction kinetics. Herein, we incorporate MnO2 nanowires and Co3O4 hollow polyhedrons with abundant oxygen vacancies (Vo) into MnO2/Co3O4 sugar&#8208;gourd nanohybrids for boosting CO2 photoreduction. The MnO2/Co3O4 nanohybrids not only display strong absorption in the visible&#8211;near infrared region, but also facilitate the separation of photogenerated carriers in terms of S&#8208;scheme transfer pathway, supplying abundant electrons for CO2 reduction reaction. Furthermore, the presence of VO enhances the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers and promotes the chemical adsorption to CO2 molecules. In addition, the interfacial electronic interaction between MnO2 and Co3O4 also contributes to the chemical adsorption and activation to CO2. Owing to the synergy of S&#8208;scheme transfer pathway and VO, the MnO2/Co3O4 hybrids exhibit greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity towards CO2 reduction under the irradiation of visible light in comparison with bare MnO2 and Co3O4, delivering a CO evolution rate of 15.9 umol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a 100% selectivity.</description>

                Pneumomediastinum, characterized by the presence of air in the mediastinum, is rare in newborns, especially in the spontaneous form, when it is not associated with assisted ventilation procedures or other pulmonary impairments. The diagnosis is not always obvious and immediate, which is why, in most cases, additional imaging tests are required for confirmation. Early identification of the lesion and appropriate treatment are essential, as the undue presence of air can compromise lung structures and, in the case of neonates, pneumomediastinum is associated with loculation. With the aim of elucidating the topic, the case of a full-term male newborn, born by Cesarean section at 37 weeks of gestation, was reported. Son of a healthy 26-year-old mother, the newborn's vital signs were normal and anthropometry was considered adequate. With one day of life, signs of respiratory distress were recorded, with a drop in oxygen saturation and moderate subcostal insufficiency. Chest x-rays and computed tomography were performed. Imaging examinations revealed slightly triangular hyper transparency resulting from the removal of the thymus gland by a collection of repressed air, which is known as &#8220;Spinnaker sign&#8221;, or &#8220;boat sail sign&#8221;, or even &#8220;angel wing sign&#8221;, being the main radiographic feature of pneumomediastinum. The pneumomediastinum of the patient in question proved to be too voluminous, therefore, it was decided to perform mediastinal drainage. No complications were recorded after the intervention, with the newborn's satisfactory and progressive clinical evolution.</description>

                Abstract Ligand-protected metal nanoclusters (NCs) represent a significant advancement in the field of catalysis due to their unique size-specific electronic and geometric structures. These properties are highly dependent on the metal species, number of constituent atoms, and geometric structure of the metal NC. We discuss on the synthesis, stability, structural characterization, and electrocatalytic/photocatalytic applications of these fascinating materials, emphasizing their superior performance over conventional catalysts. In this study, we have obtained a deeper understanding of the interaction between the metal core and the organic ligands protecting the metal NCs, as well as the desorption behavior of the ligands under calcination, which is crucial for the application of metal NCs as heterogeneous catalysts. Based on this understanding, we have demonstrated that metal NCs-supported catalysts with appropriate pretreatment exhibit higher activity as photocatalysts compared to conventional catalysts. Moreover, by suppressing oxygen poisoning through the use of sulfur species in the ligands, Pt NCs showed high activity as cocatalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution in water splitting. Additionally, atomically precised phosphine-protected Pt NCs exhibited high activity as cathode electrocatalysts for fuel cells. These findings are expected to significantly contribute to the development of more diverse catalysts based on metal NCs, including those with varying metal species, numbers of constituent atoms, and geometric structures.</description>

                Abstract Electrochemical conversion of nitrate (NO 3 &#8722; ) to ammonia (NH 3 ) is a potential way to produce green NH 3 and remediate the nitrogen cycle. In this paper, an efficient catalyst of spherical CuO made by stacking small particles with oxygen&#8208;rich vacancies is reported. The NH 3 yield and Faraday efficiency are 15.53 mg h &#8722;1 mg cat &#8722;1 and 90.69%, respectively, in a neutral electrolyte at a voltage of &#8208;0.80 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode). The high activity of the electrodes results from changes in the phase and structure during electrochemical reduction. Structurally, there is a shift from a spherical structure with dense accumulation of small particles to a layered network structure with uniform distribution of small particles stacked on top of each other, thus exposing more active sites. Furthermore, in terms of phase, the electrode transitions from CuO to Cu/Cu(OH) 2 . Density functional theory calculations showed that Cu(OH) 2 formation enhances NO 3 &#8208; adsorption. Meanwhile, the Cu(OH) 2 can inhibit the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, while the formation of Cu (111) crystal surfaces facilitates the hydrogenation reaction. The synergistic effect between the two promotes the NO 3 &#8208; to NH 3 . Therefore, this study provides a new idea and direction for Cu&#8208;based oxides in electrocatalytic NH 3 production.</description>

                Abstract The stepwise oxygenation of Earth's surficial environment is thought to have shaped the evolutionary history of life. Microfossil records and molecular clocks suggest eukaryotes appeared during the Paleoproterozoic, perhaps shortly after the Great Oxidation Episode at ca. 2.43 Ga. The mildly oxygenated atmosphere and surface oceans likely contributed to the early evolution of eukaryotes. However, the principal trigger for the eukaryote appearance and a potential factor for their delayed expansion (i.e., intermediate ocean redox conditions until the Neoproterozoic) remain poorly understood, largely owing to a lack of constraints on marine and terrestrial nutrient cycling. Here, we analyzed redox&#8208;sensitive element contents and organic carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of relatively low metamorphic&#8208;grade (greenschist facies) black shales preserved in the Flin Flon Belt of central Canada to examine open&#8208;marine redox conditions and biological activity around the ca. 1.9 Ga Flin Flon oceanic island arc. The black shale samples were collected from the Reed Lake area in the eastern part of the Flin Flon Belt, and the depositional site was likely distal from the Archean cratons. The black shales have low Al/Ti ratios and are slightly depleted in light rare&#8208;earth elements relative to the post&#8208;Archean average shale, which is consistent with a limited contribution from felsic igneous rocks in Archean upper continental crust. Redox conditions have likely varied between suboxic and euxinic at the depositional site of the studied section, as suggested by variable U/Al and Mo/Al ratios. Organic carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of the black shales are approximately &#8722;23&#8240; and +13.7&#8240;, respectively, and these values are systematically higher than those of broadly coeval continental margin deposits (approximately &#8722;30&#8240; for &#948; 13 C org and +5&#8240; for &#948; 15 N bulk ). These elevated values are indicative of high productivity that led to enhanced denitrification (i.e., a high denitrification rate relative to nitrogen influx at the depositional site). Similar geochemical patterns have also been observed in the modern Peruvian oxygen minimum zone where dissolved nitrogen compounds are actively lost from the reservoir via denitrification and anammox, but the large nitrate reservoir of the deep ocean prevents exhaustion of the surface nitrate pool. Nitrogen must have been widely bioavailable in the ca. 1.9 Ga oceans, and its supply to upwelling zones must have supported habitable environments for eukaryotes, even in the middle of oceans around island arcs.</description>
