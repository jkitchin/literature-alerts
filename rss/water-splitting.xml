      <title>Magnetic Field Effect on the Electrocatalytic Activity of Cobalt-Phosphate Oxyhydroxide Oxygen Evolving Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-k3x2k</link>
      <description>Ruben Mirzoyan, H&#233;ctor Barrientos, Keon Ha Hwang, Ryan G. Hadt, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401814626

                We demonstrate a 30 &#8211; 40% enhancement in electrocatalytic current for water splitting with an externally applied magnetic field of 1.5 T. The observed effect is unvaried by the presence of a cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide catalyst and is attributed to the removal of O2 gas bubbles at the surface of the electrode. The results indicate that the applied magnetic field acts in concert with the electrocatalyst to further lower the overpotential of water oxidation, highlighting the importance for more detailed studies of magnetic field effects in electrocatalytic materials.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of individual metal contribution on active sites tailoring in multimetallic oxygen evolution catalytic system</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.08.167</link>
      <description>Jiejie Feng, Liling Wei, Huayi Li, Jianquan Shen, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. 678(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4401802739

                Synergistic effects among different metals have positioned multimetallic electrocatalysts as promising facilitators for enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), though understanding their precise mechanisms has remained elusive. Delving into the unique contributions of individual metals is crucial for comprehending the complex synergy within multimetallic systems. In this study, we employed quinary (Co, Ce, Fe, Cu, and Mn) molybdates as a model to systematically investigate the role of each metal species in tailoring active sites. Our systematic analyses unveiled the presence of crucial oxygen vacancies, which can be considered as the active sites in OER. Comparative analyses of the top-performing quinary molybdates and their quaternary counterparts highlighted distinct electronic interactions and varying densities of oxygen vacancies, indicative of the diverse electron and vacancy engineering capabilities inherent to different metals. Mott-schottky plots demonstrated the predominant contribution of Mn to specific catalytic activity, followed by Ce, Fe, Cu, and Co. Leveraging an in-situ methanol probing method, it was found that the introduction of Cu, Ce, Fe, and Mn weakened intermediate adsorption, with Mn and Ce having the most significant effects, whereas Co strengthened adsorption. This work can advance our comprehension of the role played by individual metals within multimetallic catalysts, thereby promoting a more profound understanding of synergistic effects.</description>

      <title>Boosting oxygen evolution reaction by FeNi hydroxide-organic framework electrocatalyst toward alkaline water electrolyzer</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-51521-4</link>
      <description>Yuzhen Chen, Qiuhong Li, Yuxing Lin, Jiao Liu, Jing Pan, Jingguo Hu, Xiaoyong Xu, Nature Communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401808265

                The oxygen evolution reaction plays a vital role in modern energy conversion and storage, and developing cost-efficient oxygen evolution reaction catalysts with industrially relevant activity and durability is highly desired but still challenging. Here, we report an efficient and durable FeNi hydroxide organic framework nanosheet array catalyst that competently affords long-term oxygen evolution reaction at industrial-grade current densities in alkaline electrolyte. The desirable high-intensity performance is attributed to three aspects as follows. First, two-dimensional nanosheet porous arrays with maximum specific surface facilitate mass/charge transfer to accommodate high-current-density catalysis. Second, in situ derived FeNi hydroxide motifs offer bimetallic synergistic catalysis centers with high intrinsic activity. Third, carboxyl ligands alleviate metal oxidation favorable for charge tolerability against peroxidation dissolution under strong polarization. As a result, this catalyst requires an overpotential of only 280 mV to deliver high current density up to 1 A/cm2 with long durability over 1000 h. Moreover, an alkaline water electrolyzer with this catalyst alternative demonstrates an increased economic effectiveness compared to commercial levels at present. Developing cost-efficient catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction is crucial for various modern energy technologies. Here the authors report an efficient and durable NiFe hydroxide organic framework catalyst for water oxidation at 1 A/cm2 with long durability over 1000 h.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Role of Spin State in Cobalt Oxyhydroxides for Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202408005</link>
      <description>Hongnan Jia, Na Yao, Zhengkai Liao, Liqing Wu, Juan Zhu, Yunhao Lao, Wei Wang, Angewandte Chemie International Edition. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401812963

                Although the electronic state of catalysts is strongly corrected with their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, understanding the role of spin state in dynamic electronic structure evolution during OER process is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spin state regulation strategy to boost the OER performance of CoOOH through elemental doping (CoMOOH, M = V, Cr, Mn, Co and Cu). Experimental results including magnetic characterization, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and density functional theory calculations unveil that Mn doping could successfully increase the Co sites from low spin state to intermediate spin state, leading to the largest lattice distortion and smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals among the obtained CoMOOH electrocatalysts. Benefiting from the promoted electron transfer from dxy to dz2 orbital, facilitated formation of active high&#8208;valent *O&#8208;Co(IV) species at applied potential, and reduced energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step, the CoMnOOH exhibits the highest OER performance. Our work provides significant insight into the correction between dynamic electronic structure evolution and OER performance by understanding the role of spin state regulation in metal oxyhydroxides, paving a new avenue for rational design of high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Constructing Dual&#8208;Phase Co9S8&#8208;CoMo2S4 Heterostructure as an Efficient Trifunctional Electrocatalyst for Oxygen Reduction, Oxygen Evolution and Hydrogen Evolution Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202400678</link>
      <description>Wenjie Wang, Yuqing Chen, Shushan Qiao, Jing Zhao, Wenlong Zhao, Yike Wei, Yanhong Tang, Chengbin Liu, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401819899

                Designing robust, efficient and inexpensive trifunctional electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is significant for rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries and water&#8208;splitting devices. To this end, constructing heterogenous structures based on transition metals stands out as an effective strategy. Herein, a dual&#8208;phase Co9S8&#8208;CoMo2S4 heterostructure grown on porous N, S&#8208;codoped carbon substrate (Co9S8&#8208;CoMo2S4/NSC) via a one&#8208;pot synthesis is investigated as the trifunctional ORR/OER/HER electrocatalyst. The optimized Co9S8&#8208;CoMo2S4/NSC2 exhibits that ORR has a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.86 V (vs. RHE) and the overpotentials at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 for OER and HER are 280 and 89 mV, respectively, superior to most transition&#8208;metal based trifunctional electrocatalysts reported to date. The Co9S8&#8208;CoMo2S4/NSC2&#8208;based zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) has a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (1.41 V), large capacity (804 mA h g&#8211;1) and highly stable cyclability (97 h at 10 mA cm&#8211;2). In addition, the prepared Co9S8&#8208;CoMo2S4/NSC2&#8208;based ZAB in series can self&#8208;drive the corresponding water electrolyzer. The dual&#8208;phase Co9S8&#8208;CoMo2S4 heterostructure provides not only multi&#8208;type active sites to drive the ORR, OER and HER, but also high&#8208;speed charge transfer channels between two phases to improve the synergistic effect and reaction kinetics.</description>

      <title>Enriched Oxygen Coverage Localized within Ir Atomic Grids for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>

                Abstract Inefficient active site utilization of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts have limited the energy efficiency of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Here, an atomic grid structure is demonstrated composed of high&#8208;density Ir sites (&#8776;10 atoms per nm 2 ) on reactive MnO 2&#8211;x support which mediates oxygen coverage&#8208;enhanced OER process. Experimental characterizations verify the low&#8208;valent Mn species with decreased oxygen coordination in MnO 2&#8211;x exert a pivotal impact in the enriched oxygen coverage on the surface during OER process, and the distributed Ir atomic grids, where highly electrophilic Ir&#9472;O (II&#8208;&#948;)&#8722; bonds proceed rapidly, render intense nucleophilic attack of oxygen radicals. Thereby, this metal&#8208;support cooperation achieves ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 166 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and 283 mV at 500 mA cm &#8722;2 , together with a striking mass activity which is 380 times higher than commercial IrO 2 at 1.53 V. Moreover, its high OER performance also markedly surpasses the commercial Ir black catalyst in PEM electrolyzers with long&#8208;term stability.</description>

      <title>Preparation of Alkali Metal Iridates as Oxygen Evolution Catalysts Via Thermal Transformation of Amorphous Iridium (oxy)hydroxides.</title>

                Achieving efficient water&#8208;splitting under acidic conditions for hydrogen production is severely limited by the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Overcoming this obstacle is vital to realise effective electrolysers and deliver a hydrogen&#8208;driven economy. Iridium oxides remain one of the only viable catalysts under acidic conditions due to their corrosion resistance, however, a fine balance exists between the activity and stability of differing oxide morphologies. We have previously shown that heat&#8208;treating high&#8208;activity amorphous iridium oxyhydroxide in the presence of residual lithium carbonate leads to the formation of lithium&#8208;layered iridium oxide, suppressing the formation of low&#8208;activity crystalline rutile IrO2. We now report our recent work on the synthesis of similar compounds, Na&#8208;IrOx and K&#8208;IrOx, featuring similarly layered crystalline structures. Electrocatalytic tests confirm Li&#8208;IrOx has similar electrocatalytic activity as commercial amorphous IrO2&#183;2H2O and with increasing size of the intercalated cation, the activity towards the OER decreases. However, the synthesised electrocatalysts show greater stability than crystalline rutile IrO2 and amorphous IrO2&#183;2H2O, suggesting these compounds could be viable alternatives for industrial PEM electrolysers where durability is a key performance criterion.</description>

                Prussian blue analogues (PBA) are a large family of functional materials with diverse applications such as in electrochemical fields. However, their use in the emerging two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction for clean production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is lagging. Herein, a general solvent exchange induced reconstruction strategy is demonstrated, through which an abnormal NiNi&#8208;PBA superstructure is synthesized as a high&#8208;performance electrocatalyst for H2O2 generation. The resultant NiNi&#8208;PBA superstructure has a stoichiometric composition with saturated lattice water, and a leaf&#8208;like morphology composed of interconnected small&#8208;size nanosheets with identical orientation and predominate {210} side surface exposure. Our studies show that the Ni&#8208;N centers on {210} facets are the active sites, and the saturated lattice H2O favors a six&#8208;coordinated environment that results in high selectivity. The "perfect" structure including stoichiometric composition and ideal facet exposure leads to a high selectivity of ~100% and H2O2 yield of 5.7 mol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, superior to the reported MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts and most other electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract The introduction of noble metal into spinel structure is an effective strategy to develop efficient oxygen evolution/reduction reaction (OER/ORR) catalysts. Herein, surface Co oct is substituted by Ru oct in Ru x &#8208;Mn 0.5 Co 2.5&#8208;x O 4 /NCNTs by ion&#8208;exchange, where presence of Ru oct &#9472;O&#9472;Co oct unit facilitates electron transfer. This strong electron coupling effect leads downward shift in d&#8208;band center and a narrowing of d&#8208;p bandgap. The increased charge density of Co oct bridged with Ru oct dioxygen optimizes adsorption of oxygen intermediates ( * OH) and occupation of electrons in e g &#8208;orbital octahedral. The measured ORR/OER voltage difference is only 0.71 V. The peak power density of assembled zinc&#8211;air battery reaches 148.8 mW h cm &#8722;2 , and energy density at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 reaches 813.6 mA h g Zn &#8722;1 , approaching a theoretical value of 820 mA h g Zn &#8722;1 . The catalyst demonstrates stable operation for over 500 h at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and over 200 h at 50 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides new insights to guide fabrication of advanced oxygen electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Role of Spin State in Cobalt Oxyhydroxides for Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202408005</link>

                Although the electronic state of catalysts is strongly corrected with their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performances, understanding the role of spin state in dynamic electronic structure evolution during OER process is still challenging. Herein, we developed a spin state regulation strategy to boost the OER performance of CoOOH through elemental doping (CoMOOH, M = V, Cr, Mn, Co and Cu). Experimental results including magnetic characterization, in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ Raman and density functional theory calculations unveil that Mn doping could successfully increase the Co sites from low spin state to intermediate spin state, leading to the largest lattice distortion and smallest energy gap between dxy and dz2 orbitals among the obtained CoMOOH electrocatalysts. Benefiting from the promoted electron transfer from dxy to dz2 orbital, facilitated formation of active high&#8208;valent *O&#8208;Co(IV) species at applied potential, and reduced energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step, the CoMnOOH exhibits the highest OER performance. Our work provides significant insight into the correction between dynamic electronic structure evolution and OER performance by understanding the role of spin state regulation in metal oxyhydroxides, paving a new avenue for rational design of high&#8208;activity electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract The corrosion of SiC f /SiC composites in gas environment threatens their long&#8208;term service in aeroengines as hot&#8208;end structure components. Addition of corrosion&#8208;resistant phases into SiC matrix is a potential strategy to improve the service performance of SiC f /SiC materials. Here, AlN added SiC ceramics were prepared by reactive melt infiltration, and the effect of AlN phase on the oxidation resistance of the ceramics was emphasized. The oxidation tests were performed in dry oxygen and water oxygen atmospheres at 1100&#176;C&#8211;1300&#176;C, respectively. The oxidation mechanism was discussed based on the microstructure evolution of the oxide layer. The results show that the oxide layer is composed of aluminum silicate glass and Al 2 O 3 flakes dispersedly distributed in the glass phase. As the temperature rises, the oxide layer gradually grows and thickens. Finally, a smooth and dense protective layer could be formed on the surface of ceramics to resist oxidation. This study can provide a profound insight to construct SiC f /SiC composites with excellent oxidation resistance.</description>

      <title>Furfural tolerance of mutant Saccharomyces cerevisiae selected via ionizing radiation combined with adaptive laboratory evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1186/s13068-024-02562-w</link>

                Lignocellulose is a renewable and sustainable resource used to produce second-generation biofuel ethanol to cope with the resource and energy crisis. Furfural is the most toxic inhibitor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells produced during lignocellulose treatment, and can reduce the ability of S. cerevisiae to utilize lignocellulose, resulting in low bioethanol yield. In this study, multiple rounds of progressive ionizing radiation was combined with adaptive laboratory evolution to improve the furfural tolerance of S. cerevisiae and increase the yield of ethanol. In this study, the strategy of multiple rounds of progressive X-ray radiation combined with adaptive laboratory evolution significantly improved the furfural tolerance of brewing yeast. After four rounds of experiments, four mutant strains resistant to high concentrations of furfural were obtained (SCF-R1, SCF-R2, SCF-R3, and SCF-R4), with furfural tolerance concentrations of 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, and 4.5 g/L, respectively. Among them, the mutant strain SCF-R4 obtained in the fourth round of radiation had a cellular malondialdehyde content of 49.11 nmol/mg after 3 h of furfural stress, a weakening trend in mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, a decrease in accumulated reactive oxygen species, and a cell death rate of 12.60%, showing better cell membrane integrity, stable mitochondrial function, and an improved ability to limit reactive oxygen species production compared to the other mutant strains and the wild-type strain. In a fermentation medium containing 3.5 g/L furfural, the growth lag phase of the SCF-R4 mutant strain was shortened, and its growth ability significantly improved. After 96 h of fermentation, the ethanol production of the mutant strain SCF-R4 was 1.86 times that of the wild-type, indicating that with an increase in the number of irradiation rounds, the furfural tolerance of the mutant strain SCF-R4 was effectively enhanced. In addition, through genome-transcriptome analysis, potential sites related to furfural detoxification were identified, including GAL7, MAE1, PDC6, HXT1, AUS1, and TPK3. These results indicate that multiple rounds of progressive X-ray radiation combined with adaptive laboratory evolution is an effective mutagenic strategy for obtaining furfural-tolerant mutants and that it has the potential to tap genes related to the furfural detoxification mechanism.</description>

                Abstract Sufficient utilization of visible&#8208;light generated charge carriers in proton reduction reactions is of great significance for the development of effective solar&#8208;fuel technologies. Achieving simultaneous bulk rapid transfer and surface efficient extraction of charge carriers is still very challenging. Herein, it is found for the first time ammonium persulfate (APS) can significantly influence polymerization processes of C 3 N 4 (CN) from melamine to poly (heptazine imide) (PHI) under the simultaneous oxygen doping and etching effect of SO 4 2&#8722; . PHI with high crystallinity, porous structure, and in&#8208;situ oxygen doping was therefore obtained through one&#8208;step APS&#8208;assisted salt strategy. Benefiting from sufficient visible&#8208;light absorption and upshifted conduction band originating from regulated electronic structure and optimized morphology through APS modification, the as&#8208;prepared PHI achieved a H 2 evolution activity of 3274.23 &#956;mol h &#8722;1 g &#8722;1 ( &#955; &gt; 420 nm), which is appropriately 148 and 19 times that of conventional and crystalline CN. This work opens up new opportunities for efficient photocatalysis.</description>

                Abstract Ion pickup by the solar wind is ubiquitous in space plasma. Because pickup ions are originally produced by ionization of an exospheric neutral atmosphere, their measurements contain information on the exospheric neutral abundance. Here we established a method to retrieve exospheric number densities, by analyzing the ion velocity distribution functions of pickup ions measured by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft. We successfully retrieved exospheric oxygen density distributions at altitudes ranging from 1000 to 10,000 km around Mars except for the vicinity of the bow shock. This method can be applied to other space missions to study the upper atmosphere of planets, moons, and other small bodies in our solar system, where pickup ions exist.</description>

      <title>2D TMDC aging: a case study of monolayer WS2 and mitigation strategies</title>

                Abstract Due to their unique properties, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) are considered for diverse applications in microelectronics, sensing, catalysis, to name a few. A common challenge in 2D TMDC research is the film&#8217;s inherent instability i.e., spontaneous oxidation upon ambient exposure. The present study systematically explores the effect aging on the film composition and photoluminescent properties of monolayer WS2, synthetically grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The aging rate is investigated for different oxygen (i.e., O2 gas concentration and humidity) and light-controlled environments. Simple mitigation strategies that do not involve capping the 2D TMDC layer are discussed, and their effectiveness demonstrated by benchmarking the evolution in photoluminescence response against ambient exposed monolayer WS2. These results highlight the need to store 2D TMDCs in controlled environments to preserve the film quality and how future studies can account for the aging effect.</description>

                It is essential to diversity energy sources for ensuring sustainability. While hydrogen is considered a promising energy storage medium, its potential hinges on the development of efficient photocatalysts for green production. In addressing this challenge, we evaluated the performance of a heterojunction system composed of non-stoichiometric molybdenum oxides (MoO3-x) and cadmium sulfide (CdS) quantum dots (QDs) for water splitting. MoO3-x were synthesized via gamma irradiation of the MoO3 in the presence of formic acid (FA), while CdS-MPA QDs were electrosynthesized. The heterojunction was formed through adsorption. The structural and electronic characterization revealed a progressive transformation from MoO3 to MoO3-x and MoO3-x/CdS-MPA QDs, demonstrating enhanced water-splitting performance. Upon evaluation, the study revealed a charge transfer mechanism, highlighting the significance of relative band positions between MoO3-x and CdS-MPA QDs in promoting eco-friendly hydrogen evolution and methanol processing. Thus, we suggest that the synergism between MoO3-x and CdS-MPA QDs semiconductors makes the heterojunction system a promising solution for photocatalytic production of hydrogen and oxygen.</description>

                One approach to enriching the Learning Health System (LHS) is leveraging vital signs and data from wearable technologies. Blood oxygen, heart rate, respiration rates, and other data collected by wearables (like sleep and exercise patterns) can be used to monitor and predict health conditions. This data is already being collected and could be used to improve healthcare in several ways. Our approach will be health data interoperability with HL7 FHIR (for data exchange between different systems), openEHR (to store researchable data separated from software but connected to ontologies, external terminologies and code sets) and maintain the semantics of data. OpenEHR is a standard that has an important role in modelling processes and clinical decisions. The six pillars of Lifestyle Medicine can be a first attempt to change how patients see their daily decisions, affecting the mid to long-term evolution of their health. Our objective is to develop the first stage of the LHS based on a co-produced personal health recording (CoPHR) built on top of a local LLM that interoperates health data through HL7 FHIR, openEHR, OHDSI and terminologies that can ingest external evidence and produces clinical and personal decision support and, when combined with many other patients, can produce or confirm evidence.</description>

                Abstract Phase inversion involves in a complex process due to numerous factors affecting the membrane formation. Among them, polymer chain entanglement from polymeric membrane materials plays a critical role in regulating membrane structure and is still worth further exploration. Herein, a series of methacrylate copolymers with different contents of poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA) were designed and synthesized, and ultrafiltration membranes cast from these copolymers were systematically investigated regarding structural evolution and filtration performance. Surface zeta potential of membranes gradually transformed from positive to negative with the increasing PEGMA content due to nonsolvent-induced surface migration of element oxygen, and meanwhile the transformation from finger-like pore structure to sponge-like pore structure in the support layer was observed, which could be attributed to chain entanglement of the PEGMA-rich copolymer. Filtration experiments indicated that sponge-like membranes possessed better separation effect of Victoria blue B compared with finger-like membranes, and the optimized mPP40-15 % showed a retention rate of 99.55 % and permeance of 110.26 L m &#8722;2 h &#8722;1 bar &#8722;1 and displayed good selective separation of dye/salt mixture. Besides, sponge-like membranes also exhibited easy regeneration, anti-fouling property and filtration stability. This work will provide guidance for modulating membrane structure and offer an alternative material for membrane separation in handling dye wastewater.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Antioxidant-Ciprofloxacin Combinations on the Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Biofilms</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-4756544/v1</link>

                Abstract Antibiotic resistance in biofilms is a critical challenge driven by mechanisms such as increased oxidative stress, which could lead to enhanced mutagenesis. Experimental evolution studies have shown that biofilm growth fosters antimicrobial resistance and tolerance. The bactericidal antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) exacerbates oxidative stress, enhancing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mutagenesis at sub-inhibitory concentrations. This study tests the hypothesis that antioxidants (AOs) such as N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), and Edaravone (ED) could serve as anti-evolutionary drugs to prevent or reduce antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa biofilms exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin (CIP), with Thiourea (THU) used as a control. In vitro experimental evolution studies using the monitor strain PAO1-mCherry-PCD-gfp + were conducted in flow cells and glass beads biofilm models. The harvested biofilm populations underwent population analysis and the flow-cell populations were also whole genome sequenced (WGS). The results showed that the CIP-AO combination of CIP-THU could reduce the fast increase of mutagenic resistance in both biofilm models. The confocal laser microscopy of flow cells biofilms showed a reduction in the percentage of nfxB mutants in biofilms treated with all the three CIP-AO combinations compared to the CIP treatment alone following 24h of treatment. The population analysis revealed a significant reduction of the subpopulations growing on 0.5 mg/L of CIP-supplemented plates in all the combined treatments of CIP-AO as compared to CIP populations. The WGS results showed CIP-specific mutants in the CIP-treated populations including nfxB and nalC mutations which were not observed in CIP-AO-treated ones. Flagellar gene mutations appeared in CIP-ED (fliG) and CIP-NAC (flhA) treatments. Additionally, wspA, which regulates biofilm formation, had a transversion mutation in CIP-ED and a deletion mutation in CIP-NAC. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) level for CIP-treated isolates was significantly higher than all isolates from CIP-AO treatments in both tested biofilm models of flow cells and glass beads. Overall, these findings suggest that the two clinical antioxidants may have a potential role in mitigating the development of antibiotic resistance in biofilms.</description>

                Background/Objectives: To analyze the best noninvasive tests prognosis marker in patients with diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) who underwent endovascular revascularization based on clinical outcomes, such as healing rate, time to heal, and free amputation survival after at least a six-month follow-up. Methods: A multicentric prospective observational study was performed with 28 participants with ischemic or neuroischemic DFU who came to the participant centers and underwent endovascular revascularization between January 2022 and March 2023. Toe systolic pressure (TP), ankle systolic pressure (AP), the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI), the toe brachial pressure index (TBPI), transcutaneous pressure of oxygen (TcPO2), and skin perfusion pressure (SPP) were evaluated using PeriFlux 6000 System, Perimed, Sweden, before (Visit 0) and four weeks after revascularization (Visit 1). The primary clinical outcome was an evaluation of the clinical evolution of noninvasive tests comparing Visit 0 and Visit 1, estimating the sensitivity for predicting wound healing of noninvasive tests at six months following initial recruitment. Results: After six months, 71.43% (n = 20) of DFU healed, four patients (14.3%) received major amputations, and one (3.5%) died. The two tests that best predicted wound healing after revascularization according to the ROC curve were TcPO2 and TP with sensitivities of 0.89 and 0.70 for the cut-off points of 24 mmHg and 46 mmHg, respectively. Conclusions: TcPO2 and TP were the two tests that best predicted wound healing in patients who underwent endovascular revascularization. Clinicians should consider the importance of the evaluation of microcirculation in the healing prognosis of patients with diabetic foot ulcers.</description>

The Special Issue (Forum) also serves as a reminder that gender equity is imperative for better science&#9472;and a better world.Before delving into the featured papers, our four women guest editors share their thoughts on the opportunities and challenges encountered by women researchers in nanoscience.Jacinta C. Conrad: I'm a professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at the University of Houston and an executive editor for ACS Applied Nano Materials. I am interested in applications of complex fluids and soft materials, such as antifouling surfaces and diagnostics.Kaoru Tamada: I am from Kyushu University in Japan, and my research field is in nanomaterials and plasmonics. I'm very happy to join this project.M&#244;nica A. Cotta: I am a physics professor at the University of Campinas in Brazil, and I'm really excited about the interface between nanomaterials and biological processes as well as finding out new tools to develop biomedical devices.A. Nirmala Grace: I am Professor and Director, Centre for Nanotechnology Research, VIT, India. I am currently focusing on development of advanced 2D based materials, specifically MXene, for energy storage and energy harvesting applications.Jacinta C. Conrad: My first question is what area or topic are you most excited about that is covered by the journal scope of ACS Applied Nano Materials?M&#244;nica A. Cotta: I get excited when I see new applications of materials I have worked with a long time ago. Like quantum dots, which have been studied for many decades, but people still find new applications today. MOFs and nanoporous materials are also exciting due to so many applications. But in the journal, I end up handling a lot of research papers using a physics approach, and it is hard to choose among them what is most interesting.Kaoru Tamada: I am a fundamental research scientist, so I am very curious about applied materials research related to the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), especially, research on materials fabrication for environmental applications.Jacinta C. Conrad: We are here to discuss the Special Issue on Women in Nano that we have put together. I wanted to ask a few questions about how being a woman has shaped your journey in this space. How do you think being a woman benefits or strengthens your research? And what strengths do you bring?Kaoru Tamada: I think this is may not be limited to the field of nanomaterials research, but women's different perspectives (from men) may generate new ideas even in research areas that have been established for many years. I get this feeling when I talked to scientists in other fields like the humanities or biomedical research (in Japan).M&#244;nica A. Cotta: Applied materials is interdisciplinary by nature, joining people from physics, chemistry, engineering, biology and more&#9472;even dental science! So, you must be able to talk to all these people and respect what they know. And I think that the ability to talk and connect with people is really strong among women. Maybe it seems stereotyping, but it is really related to how we behave in society. Women are usually more prone to go into social or applied sciences, searching for something that involves people. In my research experience, I feel this ability helped a lot as I was able to relate to many people in different fields and find connections that male colleagues working in my department could not do it as well even when they tried hard. They gave up very easily on effective communications.There is also a unique strength that women can bring to nanomaterials research, which comes from our daily life. As a woman PI, I also feel that I can better empathize and encourage my students to succeed in their work.A. Nirmala Grace: I feel women bring a unique edge to nanomaterials research. Imagine blending diverse educational paths and innovative problem-solving techniques&#9472;that is what women bring to the table. This mix is not just refreshing; it drives creativity and opens up new ways to approach research design and experiments. Women are stellar at working collaboratively, a must-have in the multidisciplinary world of nanotechnology. Their knack for fostering team spirit is not just a nice to have; it is a game changer, making research groups more cohesive and output more impactful. Women's meticulous attention to detail ensures that nothing minor gets overlooked&#9472;those small factors that can hugely sway our results.Lastly, we as women are resilient in STEM, and we are no strangers to challenges. Facing significant biases yet pressing on, they bring a determination to their research that raises the bar for rigor and innovation. So, we as women do not just participate in nanotechnology&#9472;they propel it forward with their unique strengths and perspectives.Jacinta C. Conrad: M&#244;nica and Nirmala brought out the importance of being able to work across disciplinary boundaries. Do you have examples of how you have worked across these boundaries in your research?Kaoru Tamada: I myself work in diverse fields of research, combining physics, chemistry, and biological sciences. We women with our communication skills can help in coordinating many scientists working in different fields. Communication is a very important practice because after all, science has been done by human beings.M&#244;nica A. Cotta: For me, talking to biologists was really a hard test. I have a very fruitful collaboration with a molecular biologist, over 10 years long. I recall that in the beginning it was really tough, as we had a lot of quarrels due to miscommunications. The way we look at science is different, and it is nice that both of us approach it by making compromises in the end. Biology has to deal with many complex variables simultaneously; they cannot take a horse and make into an ideal sphere, like a physicist would do. Unfortunately, such good collaboration experience does not happen all the time.Jacinta C. Conrad: Let us now talk about some of the challenges that you might have faced in your career, working in as a scientist in this discipline. Could you share some of the challenges that you faced in your career that are related to being a woman?M&#244;nica A. Cotta: Being a woman physicist is tough as we are no more than 10&#8211;20% of the community. The biggest challenge for me was when I decided to move to materials science research during my Ph.D., decades ago. I had to listen to comments like "you do not do physics anymore" or "materials science is following recipes". They got me frustrated at first, but eventually my work helped me shrug these comments away. Materials science is a much more welcoming field for women. However, 20 plus years after that, my physics students still get similar comments from their colleagues, and that is very disappointing.Jacinta C. Conrad: As a physicist, one of the reasons why I love the space of materials, broadly, is because that community has a different outlook on inclusion and making people feel welcome in the field.Kaoru Tamada: For my cases, all the fields of scientific research in Japan are not easy for women in general. However, compared to the traditional field like physics with a longer history, nanomaterials is a relatively new field, so it is easier for women to be integrated there. A relatively large number of Japanese women scientists work in this field compared to other more conventional branches of chemistry.A. Nirmala Grace: One big hurdle I've faced in the realm of nanomaterials research is this deep-seated bias that is pretty common across many scientific fields. It seems like women often get less access to the crucial things we need to thrive&#9472;like funding, mentorship, and chances to network. These gaps usually come from old-school practices and cultural norms that, maybe without meaning to, tilt the scales in favor of male researchers. It is also tough because we women are not as visible in STEM, especially in the higher ranks and in niche areas like nanotechnology. This scarcity of female presence can start a tough cycle where upcoming female scientists struggle to find mentors they can relate to or even see as role models.Then, there's the sheer demand of research work, which can really clash with personal life, and often, that burden falls more heavily on women. The usual academic setups do not really bend to accommodate flexible schedules, which makes juggling a science career and family life all the more challenging. Plus, there are these lingering stereotypes about gender roles that can skew the vibe at work, sometimes leaving women with less support or expectations that just are not as high as they might be for men.Jacinta C. Conrad: One of the ideas that you have collectively brought forward is that this is a new field and that it is easier for women to work in it. Is there something about nanomaterials or applied nanomaterials that might be particularly appealing to women?M&#244;nica A. Cotta: I think that women are naturally more interested in the applied aspects of scientific research, especially applications that are related to social issues. For example, in our undergrad school, the percentage of women in medical physics is larger than for fundamental physics. Many research papers show that young women eventually get away from hard science, if it is not shown as diverse and inclusive and relatable to common needs. Materials science is appealing since it is at the base of technological development in our society, and women realize very quickly that it can benefit mankind in a very important way.Kaoru Tamada: In Japan, faculty positions in the universities in the traditional fields tend to be already filled mostly by men. Therefore, there is very little chance to join those fields and to get major funding for women. However, in the case of nanomaterials research, there is more space open for new people, especially female and young researchers, so in the end, Japanese female nanoscientists had more chance to get exposed in the field and to be a representative in the field.M&#244;nica A. Cotta: The world right now is polarized, and progressive people question gender roles and stereotypes. To be honest, my family does not know much of what I do, and I gave up explaining my career to them. I just do not fit into any stereotype they feel more comfortable with. So even within inner circles, we are challenged every day for the kind of work we do, particularly for women in Latin America. Therefore, finding partnership and inclusion among colleagues in materials science is really great!Jacinta C. Conrad: Of course, in the US right now there are real challenges related to efforts to include members of groups that have been historically underrepresented or excluded. Because science is global, being aware of the different cultural aspects is also important for understanding how to grow a field. The last question I have is, what changes would you suggest or would need to happen to improve the climate, to continue to make this field of applied nanomaterials and this discipline of materials science a good place for women and other groups to work in? How can we better these fields?Kaoru Tamada: I'm a university vice president responsible for diversity, equity, and inclusion, so my opinion is very generalized to that perspective, not specific to chemistry or physics. In order to promote the active participation of women, I believe it is extremely important to create a climate where women are accepted, welcomed, and feel free to speak out. I think that women can fully engage in scientific research nowadays, and women are not a minority in science anymore. In fact, 50% of humanity is women, so women are not a minority to begin with. However, if women have been treated as a minority throughout history, women should not just wait for someone to create an environment for them, but rather actively participate and create a system that is comfortable for them.M&#244;nica A. Cotta: Women are a minoritized majority. We are usually the majority in population but the minority in terms of rights and respect. The main problem with women is in society in general. So, we need to create a culture of inclusion just like Kaoru said, by moving forward diversity and equity policies which can change culture in the long term. But first of all, we need to "remind ourselves" of gender issues in our daily life, to fight against microaggressions and build up representation, occupying spaces in which we are not usually present. In particular, nanoscience research strongly demonstrates how diversity provides a more welcoming environment, which in turn makes the field advance much faster.A. Nirmala Grace: I feel many research environments just are not built with everyone's needs in mind, and that can really throw off work&#8211;life balance and overall job satisfaction, especially for women. Imagine how much more inviting workplaces could be if they offered flexible working hours, solid support for parental leave, and child care solutions. These changes could make a huge difference in making everyone feel welcome. Now, when it comes to research funding, there's a noticeable lean toward projects led by men. This imbalance limits the resources that could flow into women-led research. We need funding bodies to step up, make their processes crystal clear, and maybe even earmark some funds specifically for projects led by women or other historically excluded groups; though there are some specific projects existing now, these need to be increased.Recognition is another big area. Women's contributions in nanotechnology, like in many fields, often do not get the spotlight they deserve. Institutions could really help change the narrative by actively celebrating these achievements with awards and public acknowledgments. This not only boosts the profile of women scientists but also lights up the path for the next generation. Networking is crucial too. Women sometimes face extra hurdles here, both internal and external. Boosting support for women-specific professional networks can open a lot of doors, and ensuring that conferences and symposiums strive for gender balance in speakers and attendees would also level the playing field. By tackling these issues, we can create a more equal and dynamic environment in nanotechnology research.Jacinta C. Conrad: I will add that finding support is crucial for women researchers. That includes financial support, to ensure that women and other people can pursue questions that are of interest to them and that may be beneficial to society. I think that we can all agree with the need to continue to fund these activities.Kaoru Tamada: I am proud of this "Women in Nano" Special Issue because we are providing exposure to high quality research activities done by women scientists. Many talented women researchers are willing to present their latest results in this Special Issue, which means that they are very positive to take this kind of action in our nanomaterials society&#9472;that is a great thing for the future of our society. We hope this Special Issue will deliver our message that women's participation in science is invaluable.Jacinta C. Conrad: I'm also excited that this Special Issue includes contributions from women at all stages in their research careers and from at least 16 countries. Both are shifts toward greater inclusion.Our Special Issue (Forum) also collected several author responses to the question: "What strengths do you bring to nanomaterials research as a woman, and what challenges have you encountered in this discipline?"Dr. Afriyanti Sumboja, Associate Professor, Indonesia: Women can bring a unique perspective to nanomaterials research by emphasizing collaborative approaches. Especially, women's ability to empathize and communicate effectively across diverse teams can foster strong teamwork, leading to innovative solutions and better outcomes in scientific research. Moreover, most female scientists have experienced navigating challenges in a male-dominated environment, which honed their resilience and determination, qualities that are invaluable in pushing the boundaries in nanomaterials research.Dr. Roya Majidi, Associate Professor, Iran: I consider myself fortunate that my family, professors, and colleagues have provided me with equal opportunities for education and research as a woman. However, I have encountered the challenge of society's perception that women, due to family responsibilities, physical conditions, and emotional sensitivities, may not be able to consistently and deeply commit themselves to scientific research. Consequently, I have consistently exerted greater effort than men to demonstrate my abilities and achieve similar professional and research opportunities. I am delighted that now, as a university professor specializing in nanophysics, I have the opportunity to inspire the next generation of female scientists in my country to pursue their passions. I strive to show them that their aspirations are indeed within reach.Dr. Celia Machado Ronconi, Professor, Brazil: In nanomaterials research, my strengths include a solid educational background, creativity in developing new materials with innovative properties, and curiosity about material properties at the nanoscale. However, challenges arise from the field's male dominance, which limits opportunities for women and leads to frequent over-scrutiny. This environment demands technical expertise, resilience, and assertiveness from women to succeed.Dr. Manasa Nune, Associate Professor, India: As a woman I feel proud to be in the STEM field especially the area of nanomaterials which gives me an opportunity to work in the areas which have tremendous potential to be brought into the translation from lab to market. I can foresee that I could contribute to the societal development especially for the healthcare sector. I did face a few challenges in the field initially with respect to gender specific prejudices, work&#8211;life balance, etc. but could overcome them gradually, and I attribute it to the wonderful mentors that I had in my research as well as life journey which include both men and women.Isabela da Costa Tonon, Ph.D. student at University of Campinas, works on 2D materials: As a woman, I believe that throughout our lives we are required to have the ability to adapt and perceive the particularities of situations and places very quickly and dynamically, to think and act. In the academic context, this often allowed me a broader perspective to think about and attack scientific problems in the nanomaterials area. Working with mostly male researchers in the field also allows me to reflect on other perspectives and compare my own opinions to make suggestions. At the same time, I feel a little lonely and questioning my future opportunities. Will I have the same opportunities as others? Does this (gender) matter or is it your network that will open doors? Is my niche the best career path, not just academically, but in life? Who do I talk to about these things if my male colleagues often don't share my questions. I can debate them to some extent, but I know it wouldn't be the same as talking to another woman in the nanomaterials area.Patricia Duarte de Almeida, Ph.D. student at University of Campinas, works on nanocomposites for sensors: I believe that, as a woman who has worked in other areas of physics, I can adapt more quickly to changes. I have learned to seek change to achieve better results, to move through frustration rather than remaining stagnant because of it. As for the challenges, one that I encountered was communicating my ideas and being understood by someone outside my area. It's easy to stay in a comfort zone and assume that everyone will understand what you are saying, rather than adapting your language to communicate with everyone. However, it is very important that we do this.Dr. Ayumi Hirano-Iwata, Professor, Japan: In Japan, women scientists face challenges in securing academic positions and promotions. It is not unusual for them to switch research fields in order to obtain a position. I started my career as a graduate student in chemistry, then worked as a postdoctoral fellow in biology, and now I am a professor of physics (electronics). I also teach mathematics in my classes. As a result, I have gained experience in a variety of scientific fields. In the relatively new field of nanomaterials research, I find it beneficial to draw on my diverse research background, which has become a source of originality in my work.Part 2: Highlights of Featured PapersClick to copy section linkSection link copied!As the guest editors of this Forum (Special Issue) on Women in Nano, we are delighted to present 50 papers resulting from the work of women in applied nanomaterials. Our Forum (Special Issue) features articles authored by women from at least 16 countries across career stages from graduate students to professors and practicing scientists. The articles in this Special Issue (Forum) feature applications addressing the most urgent challenges currently faced by their societies:Energy generation and storage. The transition away from fossil fuels and toward clean, abundant, and sustainable energy requires technologies to generate and store energy from renewable sources. Zhang et al. describe an approach to increase the efficiency of photovoltaics (10.1021/acsanm.3c01653). The studies by Mishra et al., Mohan et al., Gangavarapu et al., Maheshwari et al., and Kim et al. advance the development of supercapacitors for energy storage (10.1021/acsanm.3c01897, 10.1021/acsanm.3c05803, 10.1021/acsanm.3c04101, 10.1021/acsanm.4c01697, 10.1021/acsanm.4c02216), and Sahoo et al. report technologies for anodes in energy storage devices (10.1021/acsanm.3c05066). Apparla et al. briefly review the use of carbon nanomaterials in metal-ion hybrid capacitors (10.1021/acsanm.4c01889).Chemical and fuel production. Cali et al. and Velio&#287;lu et al. use nanomaterials in critical chemical process applications (10.1021/acsanm.3c04126, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03526). Replacing hydrogen produced from fossil fuel sources with that produced using renewable energy is also an essential part of the transition away from fossil fuels. Basu et al., Pal et al., Pan et al., Preethi V et al., and Sumboja et al. employ nanomaterials to produce hydrogen through water splitting, including the oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution (10.1021/acsanm.3c03203, 10.1021/acsanm.3c02870, 10.1021/acsanm.3c02909, 10.1021/acsanm.3c04129, 10.1021/acsanm.3c02092), and Sharma et al. review advances in nanotextured surfaces for water splitting (10.1021/acsanm.3c04083).Clean water. Ensuring access to clean water requires innovative technologies to detect and remove contaminants as well as harvest water from unconventional sources. Jost et al. and Sai et al. use nanomaterials to improve detection of contaminants, including metal ions as well as agricultural contaminants (10.1021/acsanm.3c05627, 10.1021/acsanm.3c04104). The papers by Badhulika et al. and Lee et al. describe strategies to degrade contaminants (10.1021/acsanm.3c02070, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03622), and Noah reviews the state of nanoparticle-laden membranes for water purification (10.1021/acsanm.3c04110). Finally, Neeroli Kizhakayil et al. report a method to harvest water from the atmosphere (10.1021/acsanm.4c00110).Human health. Early detection is an effective strategy for combating disease. The papers by Bonnani et al., Lee et al., and Parihar and Khan describe nanomaterial-enabled advances in methods to detect metabolites and biomarkers (10.1021/acsanm.3c06157, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03650, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03234), and Liu reports nanowire-based electrodes for health monitoring (10.1021/acsanm.3c03457). The small size and ready functionalization of nanoparticles makes them attractive as carriers for theranostics. Innovative nanocarrier-based delivery systems from Papadakis et al., Ronconi et al., Tanner et al., Wang et al., and Yao et al. along with Pellegrino et al.'s study of the interactions of nanoparticles with cell membranes highlight the opportunities of nanomedicine for treating conditions from sepsis to cancer and the challenges that must be overcome for effective delivery (10.1021/acsanm.3c03826, 10.1021/acsanm.3c04519, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03807, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03592, 10.1021/acsanm.4c02015, 10.1021/acsanm.3c04107).Agricultural monitoring. Nanomaterial-based sensors offer opportunities to improve outcomes in agriculture. The contributions from Martsinovich et al. and Thangamuthu et al., respectively, report sensors for soil health and soil contaminants (10.1021/acsanm.3c04147, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03148).Electronic devices. Experimental studies from Arora et al., Hirano-Iwata et al., and Khaustov et al. as well as computational studies from Majidi and Chen et al. describe applications in nanomaterials for optoelectronic devices to detect and control light (10.1021/acsanm.3c03151, 10.1021/acsanm.3c04080, 10.1021/acsanm.3c01314, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03264, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03764). Mi&#353;eikis et al. present a new design for a Hall sensor, which is used to detect speed or position (10.1021/acsanm.3c03920), and Au and Shehayeb review the use of nanoporous organic frameworks in light-emitting diodes (10.1021/acsanm.3c05190).Advanced materials. Novel applications are enabled by developments in the design, synthesis, and characterization of nanoscale structures and assemblies. Reviews by Moores and Catingan, Seabra et al., and Spangler and Vigil highlight advances in different areas of nanomaterials design (10.1021/acsanm.3c04756, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03482, 10.1021/acsanm.3c04277). Nune et al., Pantano et al., and Watanabe et al. investigate the processing of nanoparticle-based materials for applications in 3-D bioprinting, functional composites, and smart films (10.1021/acsanm.3c02962, 10.1021/acsanm.3c02946, 10.1021/acsanm.3c03940). Hamad-Schifferli et al. use paperfluidic devices to synthesize nanoparticles and chemicals (10.1021/acsanm.4c01669). Lee et al. report a new method for nanoscale imaging (10.1021/acsanm.3c04361). Finally, Ahmed et al. introduce a field-driven nanorobotic system (10.1021/acsanm.3c04143).While the focus of this Special Issue (Forum) is on applications enabled through advances in nanomaterials, we also wish to emphasize the common scientific themes that will continue to drive forward the innovative use of materials in these spaces:Role of dimensionality. From 0-D quantum dots to 1-D nanotubes to 2-D thin films and nanosheets to 3-D nanoparticles, nanoscale dimensions impart properties that are not found in bulk materials. Applications in nanomaterials will continue to benefit from the development of synthetic routes to control dimension across a wide range of chemistries.Interactions with ions and molecules: Many of the achievements highlighted in this Special Issue (Forum) are enabled by specific interactions of ions or molecules with nanoscale materials. Further advances in methods to characterize and tailor these interactions are essential for advancing applications from the ultrasensitive detection of analytes to catalytic production of fuels and chemicals.Self- and directed assembly: The organization from the nanoscale to microscale to mesoscale determines the function of hierarchically structured materials. Scalable routes to generate complex multiscale structures, whether driven by self-assembly or by application of fields, will continue to inspire novel functional applications.We thank all the authors for their contributions to this Special Issue (Forum) focused on the achievements of women in applied nanomaterials.Author InformationClick to copy section linkSection link copied!Corresponding AuthorJacinta C.

By focusing on this era, characterized by robust urban growth, we leverage a wealth of archaeological evidence. Our approach embraces a systemic perspective, interpreting cities, their supporting landscapes, and the associated societies as an intricately interconnected socioecological system. Through case studies spanning diverse regions of the Roman Empire, we bring this systemic narrative to life, offering insights into the existing literature. Our findings reveal that the environmental impacts of the prevailing socioecological systems were extensive and enduring. However, these effects were partially counteracted by the limited availability of extractable resources and energy, as well as human ingenuity. REFERENCES Aguilera , M. , V. Zech-Matterne , S.
