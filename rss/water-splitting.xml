The conversion of solar energy to chemical energy for storage is key to achieving a zero-emission society. To this end, hydrogen production from particulate photocatalysts, such as SrTaO2N (STON), through sunlight-induced water splitting is a promising solution. In this study, we report an effective method for loading Ir-based cocatalysts onto STON photocatalysts. The IrOx-modified STON particles exhibit an oxygen evolution activity with an apparent quantum efficiency of over 10% in an AgNO3 solution, which has previously not been achieved. In addition, it was determined that a high temperature of 1173 K for cocatalyst loading effectively improves the oxygen evolution rate. Furthermore, IrOx modification of STON particles by the adsorption method accompanied by high-temperature annealing under an ammonia flow affords a higher photocatalytic activity and improved reproducibility compared with those of STON particles synthesized via the conventional impregnation method owing to homogeneous loading. Our results should be useful for increasing the photocatalytic activity by developing fine cocatalyst/photocatalyst structures.</description>

      <title>[water splitting] The DFT and Machine Learning Method Accelerated the Discovery of DMSCs with High ORR and OER Catalytic Activities</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c02938</link>

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the conversion of clean energy. Recently, dual-metal-site catalysts (DMSCs) have gained much attention due to their high atom utilization, stronger stability, and better catalytic performance. An advanced method that combines density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) has been employed in this study to investigate the adsorption free energies of adsorbates on hundreds of potential catalysts, with the aim of screening for catalysts that are highly active for the ORR and OER. The result of this study is that 30 DMSCs with ORR activity superior to Pt, 10 DMSCs with OER activity superior to RuO2, and 4 bifunctional catalysts for the OER and ORR are identified. This work provides guidance for the rational selection of metals on DMSCs to prepare catalysts with a high electrocatalytic performance for renewable energy applications.</description>

      <title>[water splitting] Tensile straining of iridium sites in manganese oxides for proton-exchange membrane water electrolysers</title>

Abstract Although the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) devices, challenges remain owing to the lack of efficient and acid-stable electrocatalysts. Herein, we present a low-iridium electrocatalyst in which tensile-strained iridium atoms are localized at manganese-oxide surface cation sites (TS-Ir/MnO 2 ) for high and sustainable OER activity. In situ synchrotron characterizations reveal that the TS-Ir/MnO 2 can trigger a continuous localized lattice oxygen-mediated (L-LOM) mechanism. In particular, the L-LOM process could substantially boost the adsorption and transformation of H 2 O molecules over the oxygen vacancies around the tensile-strained Ir sites and prevent further loss of lattice oxygen atoms in the inner MnO 2 bulk to optimize the structural integrity of the catalyst. Importantly, the resultant PEMWE device fabricated using TS-Ir/MnO 2 delivers a current density of 500 mA cm &#8722;2 and operates stably for 200 h.</description>

      <title>[water splitting] TECHNOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF ELECTROLIZERS FOR HYDROGEN PRODUCTION</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.6036/10907</link>
      <description>Pierfrancesco Molina, Francisco Montero&#8208;Chac&#243;n, J.J. Brey, Dyna. 99(1)] 2024.
Electrolysis is a chemical process that uses electric current to carry out chemical reactions. It was first discovered by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1833, who conducted a series of experiments in which he passed an electric current through solutions of salts in water. He found that positively charged ions, known as cations, moved towards the negative electrode (anode), while negatively charged ions, known as anions, moved towards the positive electrode (cathode). Faraday also showed that the amount of substance deposited on the electrodes during electrolysis is proportional to the intensity of the electric current and the time of application.</description>

      <title>[water splitting] The electrocatalytic self-reconstruction of ultrathin 2D MOF nanoarrays supported on alloy foam improves the oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2023.133136</link>
      <description>Tao Ren, Jia Wang, Xinhui Yu, Yi Chen, Yuanyuan Wu, Bo Yu, Wei Jiang, Honghui Teng, Chunbo Liu, Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects. None(None)] 2024.
Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

      <title>[water splitting] Observing Long-lived Photogenerated Holes in Cobalt Oxyhydroxide Oxygen Evolution Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-14dr7</link>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

      <title>[water splitting] Recent advances and perspective on transition metal heterogeneous catalysts for efficient electrochemical water splitting</title>

Abstract The development of advanced technology for producing high&#8208;purity and low&#8208;cost hydrogen is crucial for the upcoming hydrogen economy. One of the most promising technologies to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality is hydrogen production through water electrolysis coupled with renewable energy. However, the efficiency of water electrolysis is limited by the catalyst material employed, thereby the pursuit of highly efficient catalysts is of paramount scientific significance. In this review, we focus on the synthesis of electrocatalysts for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) through various strategies such as hydrogen spillover, heterostructure construction, element doping, monatomic construction, LDH structure modification, high entropy alloy, and other approaches. The article also provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges encountered in enhancing the activity, stability, and durability of transition metal heterogeneous catalysts for both HER and OER. Moreover, the mechanisms of HER and OER are illustrated. The electrocatalysts prepared by these strategies have exhibited promising results in terms of water splitting performance. However, there are still unresolved issues that need to be addressed, such as improving long&#8208;term stability and reducing overall cost. Future prospects include exploring new materials and optimizing the preparation methods to further enhance the electrocatalytic activity.</description>

      <title>[water splitting] Plasma&#8208;Engineering of Oxygen Vacancies on NiCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Nanowires with Enhanced Bifunctional Electrocatalytic Performance for Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;air Battery</title>

Designing an efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalyst toward oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) remains a significant challenge for the development of rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). The generation of oxygen vacancies plays a vital role in modifying the surface properties of transition-metal-oxides (TMOs) and thus optimizing their electrocatalytic performances. Herein, a H2 /Ar plasma is employed to generate abundant oxygen vacancies at the surfaces of NiCo2 O4 nanowires. Compared with the Ar plasma, the H2 /Ar plasma generated more oxygen vacancies at the catalyst surface owing to the synergic effect of the Ar-related ions and H-radicals in the plasma. As a result, the NiCo2 O4 catalyst treated for 7.5 min in H2 /Ar plasma exhibited the best bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and its gap potential between Ej = 10 for OER and E1/2 for ORR is even smaller than that of the noble-metal-based catalyst. In situ electrochemical experiments are also conducted to reveal the proposed mechanisms for the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. The rechargeable ZABs, when equipped with cathodes utilizing the aforementioned catalyst, achieved an outstanding charge-discharge gap, as well as superior cycling stability, outperforming batteries employing noble-metal catalyst counterparts.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

It remains a tremendous challenge to achieve high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for hydrogen production by water splitting. Herein, a novel hybrid of 0D nickel nanoparticles dispersed on the one-dimensional (1D) molybdenum carbide micropillars embedded in the carbon layers (Ni/Mo2C@C) was successfully prepared on nickel foam by a facile pyrolysis strategy. During the synthesis process, the nickel nanoparticles and molybdenum carbide were simultaneously generated under H2 and C2H2 mixed atmospheres and conformally encapsulated in the carbon layers. Benefiting from the distinctive 0D/1D heterostructure and the synergistic effect of the biphasic Mo2C and Ni together with the protective effect of the carbon layer, the reduced activation energy barriers and fast catalytic reaction kinetics can be achieved, resulting in a small overpotential of 96 mV for the HER and 266 mV for the OER at the current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 together with excellent durability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, using the developed Ni/Mo2C@C as both the cathode and anode, the constructed electrolyzer exhibits a small voltage of 1.55 V for the overall water splitting. The novel designed Ni/Mo2C@C may give inspiration for the development of efficient bifunctional catalysts with low-cost transition metal elements for water splitting.</description>

RuO2 is one of the benchmark electrocatalysts used as the anode material in proton exchange membrane water electrolyser. However, its long&#8208;term stability is compromised due to the participation of lattice oxygen and metal dissolution during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, weakened covalency of Ru&#8208;O bond was tailored by introducing tensile strain to RuO6 octahedrons in a binary Ru&#8208;Sn oxide matrix, prohibiting the participation of lattice oxygen and the dissolution of Ru, thereby significantly improving the long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the tensile strain also optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates and boosted the OER activity. Remarkably, the RuSnOx electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER activity in 0.1 M HClO4 and required merely 184 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, it delivered a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for at least 150 h with negligible potential increase. This work exemplifies an effective strategy for engineering Ru&#8208;based catalysts with extraordinary performance toward water splitting.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

RuO2 is one of the benchmark electrocatalysts used as the anode material in proton exchange membrane water electrolyser. However, its long&#8208;term stability is compromised due to the participation of lattice oxygen and metal dissolution during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, weakened covalency of Ru&#8208;O bond was tailored by introducing tensile strain to RuO6 octahedrons in a binary Ru&#8208;Sn oxide matrix, prohibiting the participation of lattice oxygen and the dissolution of Ru, thereby significantly improving the long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the tensile strain also optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates and boosted the OER activity. Remarkably, the RuSnOx electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER activity in 0.1 M HClO4 and required merely 184 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, it delivered a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for at least 150 h with negligible potential increase. This work exemplifies an effective strategy for engineering Ru&#8208;based catalysts with extraordinary performance toward water splitting.</description>

High oxygen evolution overpotential and low corrosion resistance are regarded as the main drawbacks of anode materials in zinc electrowinning. To improve the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and reduce energy consumption in zinc electrowinning, a Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode was prepared on a Ti substrate with Sn-SbOX as an interlayer through pulse electrodeposition. The surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared anode were systematically investigated. The introduction of Co3O4 nanoparticles refined the crystal size of PbO2 and increased the surface roughness of the anode. Electrochemical tests suggested the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co3O4 nanoparticles reduced the OER free energy (1.58 eV) and that pulse electrodeposition reduced the PbO2 crystal size and increased the active surface area of the anode. In the simulated zinc electrowinning test, an improved current efficiency (90.6 %) was achieved, and the low energy consumption (2,508.29 kW&#183;h) for zinc production per ton was significantly reduced as compared with that for the conventional Pb-0.75 %Ag anode. The lifetime of the modified electrode is increased by approximately 25.8 %. This provides a reference for the design and development of anode materials with high oxygen evolution activity and strong corrosion resistance in zinc electrowinning systems.</description>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

Hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting is a very potential technology in hydrogen production at present. In particular, iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts are promising materials for electrochemical water splitting due to high catalytic activity, good electrical conductivity, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application of such catalysts was hindered for a long time due to low efficiency and poor long&#8208;term stability. The introduction of metal/non&#8208;metal or the preparation of heterostructures in the catalyst can enhance conductivity, accelerate charge transfer, and improve the stability of the catalyst. In this paper, we summarise recent research progress about iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and overall water&#8208;splitting, briefly discuss the remaining challenges in this field of research, and make suggestions for the preparation of future electrocatalysts.</description>

The conversion of solar energy to chemical energy for storage is key to achieving a zero-emission society. To this end, hydrogen production from particulate photocatalysts, such as SrTaO2N (STON), through sunlight-induced water splitting is a promising solution. In this study, we report an effective method for loading Ir-based cocatalysts onto STON photocatalysts. The IrOx-modified STON particles exhibit an oxygen evolution activity with an apparent quantum efficiency of over 10% in an AgNO3 solution, which has previously not been achieved. In addition, it was determined that a high temperature of 1173 K for cocatalyst loading effectively improves the oxygen evolution rate. Furthermore, IrOx modification of STON particles by the adsorption method accompanied by high-temperature annealing under an ammonia flow affords a higher photocatalytic activity and improved reproducibility compared with those of STON particles synthesized via the conventional impregnation method owing to homogeneous loading. Our results should be useful for increasing the photocatalytic activity by developing fine cocatalyst/photocatalyst structures.</description>

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the conversion of clean energy. Recently, dual-metal-site catalysts (DMSCs) have gained much attention due to their high atom utilization, stronger stability, and better catalytic performance. An advanced method that combines density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) has been employed in this study to investigate the adsorption free energies of adsorbates on hundreds of potential catalysts, with the aim of screening for catalysts that are highly active for the ORR and OER. The result of this study is that 30 DMSCs with ORR activity superior to Pt, 10 DMSCs with OER activity superior to RuO2, and 4 bifunctional catalysts for the OER and ORR are identified. This work provides guidance for the rational selection of metals on DMSCs to prepare catalysts with a high electrocatalytic performance for renewable energy applications.</description>

Abstract Although the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) devices, challenges remain owing to the lack of efficient and acid-stable electrocatalysts. Herein, we present a low-iridium electrocatalyst in which tensile-strained iridium atoms are localized at manganese-oxide surface cation sites (TS-Ir/MnO 2 ) for high and sustainable OER activity. In situ synchrotron characterizations reveal that the TS-Ir/MnO 2 can trigger a continuous localized lattice oxygen-mediated (L-LOM) mechanism. In particular, the L-LOM process could substantially boost the adsorption and transformation of H 2 O molecules over the oxygen vacancies around the tensile-strained Ir sites and prevent further loss of lattice oxygen atoms in the inner MnO 2 bulk to optimize the structural integrity of the catalyst. Importantly, the resultant PEMWE device fabricated using TS-Ir/MnO 2 delivers a current density of 500 mA cm &#8722;2 and operates stably for 200 h.</description>

Electrolysis is a chemical process that uses electric current to carry out chemical reactions. It was first discovered by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1833, who conducted a series of experiments in which he passed an electric current through solutions of salts in water. He found that positively charged ions, known as cations, moved towards the negative electrode (anode), while negatively charged ions, known as anions, moved towards the positive electrode (cathode). Faraday also showed that the amount of substance deposited on the electrodes during electrolysis is proportional to the intensity of the electric current and the time of application.</description>

Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

Abstract The development of advanced technology for producing high&#8208;purity and low&#8208;cost hydrogen is crucial for the upcoming hydrogen economy. One of the most promising technologies to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality is hydrogen production through water electrolysis coupled with renewable energy. However, the efficiency of water electrolysis is limited by the catalyst material employed, thereby the pursuit of highly efficient catalysts is of paramount scientific significance. In this review, we focus on the synthesis of electrocatalysts for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) through various strategies such as hydrogen spillover, heterostructure construction, element doping, monatomic construction, LDH structure modification, high entropy alloy, and other approaches. The article also provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges encountered in enhancing the activity, stability, and durability of transition metal heterogeneous catalysts for both HER and OER. Moreover, the mechanisms of HER and OER are illustrated. The electrocatalysts prepared by these strategies have exhibited promising results in terms of water splitting performance. However, there are still unresolved issues that need to be addressed, such as improving long&#8208;term stability and reducing overall cost. Future prospects include exploring new materials and optimizing the preparation methods to further enhance the electrocatalytic activity.</description>

Designing an efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalyst toward oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) remains a significant challenge for the development of rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). The generation of oxygen vacancies plays a vital role in modifying the surface properties of transition-metal-oxides (TMOs) and thus optimizing their electrocatalytic performances. Herein, a H2 /Ar plasma is employed to generate abundant oxygen vacancies at the surfaces of NiCo2 O4 nanowires. Compared with the Ar plasma, the H2 /Ar plasma generated more oxygen vacancies at the catalyst surface owing to the synergic effect of the Ar-related ions and H-radicals in the plasma. As a result, the NiCo2 O4 catalyst treated for 7.5 min in H2 /Ar plasma exhibited the best bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and its gap potential between Ej = 10 for OER and E1/2 for ORR is even smaller than that of the noble-metal-based catalyst. In situ electrochemical experiments are also conducted to reveal the proposed mechanisms for the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. The rechargeable ZABs, when equipped with cathodes utilizing the aforementioned catalyst, achieved an outstanding charge-discharge gap, as well as superior cycling stability, outperforming batteries employing noble-metal catalyst counterparts.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

It remains a tremendous challenge to achieve high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for hydrogen production by water splitting. Herein, a novel hybrid of 0D nickel nanoparticles dispersed on the one-dimensional (1D) molybdenum carbide micropillars embedded in the carbon layers (Ni/Mo2C@C) was successfully prepared on nickel foam by a facile pyrolysis strategy. During the synthesis process, the nickel nanoparticles and molybdenum carbide were simultaneously generated under H2 and C2H2 mixed atmospheres and conformally encapsulated in the carbon layers. Benefiting from the distinctive 0D/1D heterostructure and the synergistic effect of the biphasic Mo2C and Ni together with the protective effect of the carbon layer, the reduced activation energy barriers and fast catalytic reaction kinetics can be achieved, resulting in a small overpotential of 96 mV for the HER and 266 mV for the OER at the current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 together with excellent durability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, using the developed Ni/Mo2C@C as both the cathode and anode, the constructed electrolyzer exhibits a small voltage of 1.55 V for the overall water splitting. The novel designed Ni/Mo2C@C may give inspiration for the development of efficient bifunctional catalysts with low-cost transition metal elements for water splitting.</description>

RuO2 is one of the benchmark electrocatalysts used as the anode material in proton exchange membrane water electrolyser. However, its long&#8208;term stability is compromised due to the participation of lattice oxygen and metal dissolution during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, weakened covalency of Ru&#8208;O bond was tailored by introducing tensile strain to RuO6 octahedrons in a binary Ru&#8208;Sn oxide matrix, prohibiting the participation of lattice oxygen and the dissolution of Ru, thereby significantly improving the long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the tensile strain also optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates and boosted the OER activity. Remarkably, the RuSnOx electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER activity in 0.1 M HClO4 and required merely 184 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, it delivered a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for at least 150 h with negligible potential increase. This work exemplifies an effective strategy for engineering Ru&#8208;based catalysts with extraordinary performance toward water splitting.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

High oxygen evolution overpotential and low corrosion resistance are regarded as the main drawbacks of anode materials in zinc electrowinning. To improve the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and reduce energy consumption in zinc electrowinning, a Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode was prepared on a Ti substrate with Sn-SbOX as an interlayer through pulse electrodeposition. The surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared anode were systematically investigated. The introduction of Co3O4 nanoparticles refined the crystal size of PbO2 and increased the surface roughness of the anode. Electrochemical tests suggested the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co3O4 nanoparticles reduced the OER free energy (1.58 eV) and that pulse electrodeposition reduced the PbO2 crystal size and increased the active surface area of the anode. In the simulated zinc electrowinning test, an improved current efficiency (90.6 %) was achieved, and the low energy consumption (2,508.29 kW&#183;h) for zinc production per ton was significantly reduced as compared with that for the conventional Pb-0.75 %Ag anode. The lifetime of the modified electrode is increased by approximately 25.8 %. This provides a reference for the design and development of anode materials with high oxygen evolution activity and strong corrosion resistance in zinc electrowinning systems.</description>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

Hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting is a very potential technology in hydrogen production at present. In particular, iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts are promising materials for electrochemical water splitting due to high catalytic activity, good electrical conductivity, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application of such catalysts was hindered for a long time due to low efficiency and poor long&#8208;term stability. The introduction of metal/non&#8208;metal or the preparation of heterostructures in the catalyst can enhance conductivity, accelerate charge transfer, and improve the stability of the catalyst. In this paper, we summarise recent research progress about iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and overall water&#8208;splitting, briefly discuss the remaining challenges in this field of research, and make suggestions for the preparation of future electrocatalysts.</description>

The conversion of solar energy to chemical energy for storage is key to achieving a zero-emission society. To this end, hydrogen production from particulate photocatalysts, such as SrTaO2N (STON), through sunlight-induced water splitting is a promising solution. In this study, we report an effective method for loading Ir-based cocatalysts onto STON photocatalysts. The IrOx-modified STON particles exhibit an oxygen evolution activity with an apparent quantum efficiency of over 10% in an AgNO3 solution, which has previously not been achieved. In addition, it was determined that a high temperature of 1173 K for cocatalyst loading effectively improves the oxygen evolution rate. Furthermore, IrOx modification of STON particles by the adsorption method accompanied by high-temperature annealing under an ammonia flow affords a higher photocatalytic activity and improved reproducibility compared with those of STON particles synthesized via the conventional impregnation method owing to homogeneous loading. Our results should be useful for increasing the photocatalytic activity by developing fine cocatalyst/photocatalyst structures.</description>

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the conversion of clean energy. Recently, dual-metal-site catalysts (DMSCs) have gained much attention due to their high atom utilization, stronger stability, and better catalytic performance. An advanced method that combines density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) has been employed in this study to investigate the adsorption free energies of adsorbates on hundreds of potential catalysts, with the aim of screening for catalysts that are highly active for the ORR and OER. The result of this study is that 30 DMSCs with ORR activity superior to Pt, 10 DMSCs with OER activity superior to RuO2, and 4 bifunctional catalysts for the OER and ORR are identified. This work provides guidance for the rational selection of metals on DMSCs to prepare catalysts with a high electrocatalytic performance for renewable energy applications.</description>

Abstract Although the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) devices, challenges remain owing to the lack of efficient and acid-stable electrocatalysts. Herein, we present a low-iridium electrocatalyst in which tensile-strained iridium atoms are localized at manganese-oxide surface cation sites (TS-Ir/MnO 2 ) for high and sustainable OER activity. In situ synchrotron characterizations reveal that the TS-Ir/MnO 2 can trigger a continuous localized lattice oxygen-mediated (L-LOM) mechanism. In particular, the L-LOM process could substantially boost the adsorption and transformation of H 2 O molecules over the oxygen vacancies around the tensile-strained Ir sites and prevent further loss of lattice oxygen atoms in the inner MnO 2 bulk to optimize the structural integrity of the catalyst. Importantly, the resultant PEMWE device fabricated using TS-Ir/MnO 2 delivers a current density of 500 mA cm &#8722;2 and operates stably for 200 h.</description>

Electrolysis is a chemical process that uses electric current to carry out chemical reactions. It was first discovered by the British scientist Michael Faraday in 1833, who conducted a series of experiments in which he passed an electric current through solutions of salts in water. He found that positively charged ions, known as cations, moved towards the negative electrode (anode), while negatively charged ions, known as anions, moved towards the positive electrode (cathode). Faraday also showed that the amount of substance deposited on the electrodes during electrolysis is proportional to the intensity of the electric current and the time of application.</description>

Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

Abstract The development of advanced technology for producing high&#8208;purity and low&#8208;cost hydrogen is crucial for the upcoming hydrogen economy. One of the most promising technologies to achieve carbon peak and carbon neutrality is hydrogen production through water electrolysis coupled with renewable energy. However, the efficiency of water electrolysis is limited by the catalyst material employed, thereby the pursuit of highly efficient catalysts is of paramount scientific significance. In this review, we focus on the synthesis of electrocatalysts for the hydrogen/oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER) through various strategies such as hydrogen spillover, heterostructure construction, element doping, monatomic construction, LDH structure modification, high entropy alloy, and other approaches. The article also provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges encountered in enhancing the activity, stability, and durability of transition metal heterogeneous catalysts for both HER and OER. Moreover, the mechanisms of HER and OER are illustrated. The electrocatalysts prepared by these strategies have exhibited promising results in terms of water splitting performance. However, there are still unresolved issues that need to be addressed, such as improving long&#8208;term stability and reducing overall cost. Future prospects include exploring new materials and optimizing the preparation methods to further enhance the electrocatalytic activity.</description>

Designing an efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalyst toward oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) remains a significant challenge for the development of rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). The generation of oxygen vacancies plays a vital role in modifying the surface properties of transition-metal-oxides (TMOs) and thus optimizing their electrocatalytic performances. Herein, a H2 /Ar plasma is employed to generate abundant oxygen vacancies at the surfaces of NiCo2 O4 nanowires. Compared with the Ar plasma, the H2 /Ar plasma generated more oxygen vacancies at the catalyst surface owing to the synergic effect of the Ar-related ions and H-radicals in the plasma. As a result, the NiCo2 O4 catalyst treated for 7.5 min in H2 /Ar plasma exhibited the best bifunctional electrocatalytic activities and its gap potential between Ej = 10 for OER and E1/2 for ORR is even smaller than that of the noble-metal-based catalyst. In situ electrochemical experiments are also conducted to reveal the proposed mechanisms for the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. The rechargeable ZABs, when equipped with cathodes utilizing the aforementioned catalyst, achieved an outstanding charge-discharge gap, as well as superior cycling stability, outperforming batteries employing noble-metal catalyst counterparts.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

It remains a tremendous challenge to achieve high-efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for hydrogen production by water splitting. Herein, a novel hybrid of 0D nickel nanoparticles dispersed on the one-dimensional (1D) molybdenum carbide micropillars embedded in the carbon layers (Ni/Mo2C@C) was successfully prepared on nickel foam by a facile pyrolysis strategy. During the synthesis process, the nickel nanoparticles and molybdenum carbide were simultaneously generated under H2 and C2H2 mixed atmospheres and conformally encapsulated in the carbon layers. Benefiting from the distinctive 0D/1D heterostructure and the synergistic effect of the biphasic Mo2C and Ni together with the protective effect of the carbon layer, the reduced activation energy barriers and fast catalytic reaction kinetics can be achieved, resulting in a small overpotential of 96 mV for the HER and 266 mV for the OER at the current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 together with excellent durability in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte. In addition, using the developed Ni/Mo2C@C as both the cathode and anode, the constructed electrolyzer exhibits a small voltage of 1.55 V for the overall water splitting. The novel designed Ni/Mo2C@C may give inspiration for the development of efficient bifunctional catalysts with low-cost transition metal elements for water splitting.</description>

RuO2 is one of the benchmark electrocatalysts used as the anode material in proton exchange membrane water electrolyser. However, its long&#8208;term stability is compromised due to the participation of lattice oxygen and metal dissolution during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, weakened covalency of Ru&#8208;O bond was tailored by introducing tensile strain to RuO6 octahedrons in a binary Ru&#8208;Sn oxide matrix, prohibiting the participation of lattice oxygen and the dissolution of Ru, thereby significantly improving the long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the tensile strain also optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates and boosted the OER activity. Remarkably, the RuSnOx electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER activity in 0.1 M HClO4 and required merely 184 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, it delivered a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for at least 150 h with negligible potential increase. This work exemplifies an effective strategy for engineering Ru&#8208;based catalysts with extraordinary performance toward water splitting.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

However, its long&#8208;term stability is compromised due to the participation of lattice oxygen and metal dissolution during oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, weakened covalency of Ru&#8208;O bond was tailored by introducing tensile strain to RuO6 octahedrons in a binary Ru&#8208;Sn oxide matrix, prohibiting the participation of lattice oxygen and the dissolution of Ru, thereby significantly improving the long&#8208;term stability. Moreover, the tensile strain also optimized the adsorption energy of intermediates and boosted the OER activity. Remarkably, the RuSnOx electrocatalyst exhibited excellent OER activity in 0.1 M HClO4 and required merely 184 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Moreover, it delivered a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 for at least 150 h with negligible potential increase. This work exemplifies an effective strategy for engineering Ru&#8208;based catalysts with extraordinary performance toward water splitting.</description>

High oxygen evolution overpotential and low corrosion resistance are regarded as the main drawbacks of anode materials in zinc electrowinning. To improve the electrocatalytic activity of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) and reduce energy consumption in zinc electrowinning, a Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode was prepared on a Ti substrate with Sn-SbOX as an interlayer through pulse electrodeposition. The surface morphology, phase composition, and electrochemical properties of the as-prepared anode were systematically investigated. The introduction of Co3O4 nanoparticles refined the crystal size of PbO2 and increased the surface roughness of the anode. Electrochemical tests suggested the excellent electrocatalytic activity of the Co3O4 nanoparticle-modified PbO2 anode. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Co3O4 nanoparticles reduced the OER free energy (1.58 eV) and that pulse electrodeposition reduced the PbO2 crystal size and increased the active surface area of the anode. In the simulated zinc electrowinning test, an improved current efficiency (90.6 %) was achieved, and the low energy consumption (2,508.29 kW&#183;h) for zinc production per ton was significantly reduced as compared with that for the conventional Pb-0.75 %Ag anode. The lifetime of the modified electrode is increased by approximately 25.8 %. This provides a reference for the design and development of anode materials with high oxygen evolution activity and strong corrosion resistance in zinc electrowinning systems.</description>

Abstract Enhancing both the number of active sites available and the intrinsic activity of Co&#8208;based electrocatalysts simultaneously is a desirable goal. Herein, a ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;derived hierarchical porous cobalt sulfide decorated by Au nanoparticles (NPs) (denoted as HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67) hybrid is synthesized by low&#8208;temperature sulfuration treatment. The well&#8208;defined macroporous&#8211;mesoporous&#8211;microporous structure is obtained based on the combination of polystyrene spheres, as&#8208;formed Co x S y nanosheets, and ZIF&#8208;67 frameworks. This novel three&#8208;dimensional hierarchical structure significantly enlarges the three&#8208;phase interfaces, accelerating the mass transfer and exposing the active centers for oxygen evolution reaction. The electronic structure of Co is modulated by Au through charge transfer, and a series of experiments, together with theoretical analysis, is performed to ascertain the electronic modulation of Co by Au. Meanwhile, HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 catalysts with different amounts of Au were synthesized, wherein Au and NaBH 4 reductant result in an interesting &#8220;competition effect&#8221; to regulate the relative ratio of Co 2+ /Co 3+ , and moderate Au assists the electrochemical performance to reach the highest value. Consequently, the optimized HP&#8208;Au@Co x S y @ZIF&#8208;67 exhibits a low overpotential of 340 mV at 10 mA cm &#8211;2 and a Tafel slope of 42 mV dec &#8211;1 for OER in 0.1 M aqueous KOH, enabling efficient water splitting and Zn&#8211;air battery performance. The work here highlights the pivotal roles of both microstructural and electronic modulation in enhancing electrocatalytic activity and presents a feasible strategy for designing and optimizing advanced electrocatalysts.</description>

Hydrogen production by electrochemical water splitting is a very potential technology in hydrogen production at present. In particular, iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts are promising materials for electrochemical water splitting due to high catalytic activity, good electrical conductivity, low cost, and environmental friendliness. However, the practical application of such catalysts was hindered for a long time due to low efficiency and poor long&#8208;term stability. The introduction of metal/non&#8208;metal or the preparation of heterostructures in the catalyst can enhance conductivity, accelerate charge transfer, and improve the stability of the catalyst. In this paper, we summarise recent research progress about iron&#8208;group metal compound electrocatalysts in the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and overall water&#8208;splitting, briefly discuss the remaining challenges in this field of research, and make suggestions for the preparation of future electrocatalysts.</description>

0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

      <title>[water splitting] Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>[water splitting] Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>

In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Exploration of greatly efficient and steady non&#8208;noble oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is of great significance in improving the overall efficiency of energy density systems such as regenerative fuel cells, water electrolyzes, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, inspired by hierarchical 3D porous structures with open microchannels of natural wood, CoO@NiFe LDH sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets were anchored on the carbonized wood (CW) via electrodeposition and calcination strategies. The strong interactions between CoO nanosheets and NiFe LDH nanosheets endow CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst with high catalytic properties toward the OER comparable to CoO/CW and NiFe LDH/CW. The optimized CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst demonstrates good OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. This work presents an innovative approach to utilize renewable resources for constructing advanced free&#8208;standing catalysts.</description>

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Due to the slow reaction kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring in the anode side is regarded as the bottleneck of the overall water splitting and can only take place at a decent rate in the presence of efficient catalysts containing transition or noble metals. Given the huge demand for green hydrogen to decarbonize the energy sector and chemical industry, the global supply of metal catalysts has become a large concern. In this context, atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) have been proposed to be a promising alternative to the conventional nanoparticulate catalysts, enabling maximal utilization of metals and in the meantime good OER performance in the aqueous solutions of both alkali and acid. In view of huge potential application in the OER as well as water splitting, well-designed ADCs composing of transition metals (iron, cobalt or nickel) or noble metals (ruthenium or iridium) as active sites are summarized firstly in the current review. Next, the powerful tools in the investigation of structure-performance relationship and OER catalytic mechanism have been elaborated, including various in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculation. Finally, some challenges and perspectives for future development of ADCs are also listed, such as increasing the apparent activity, operation stability as well as possible device performance verification. The purpose of this review is to provide recent process in this field and our understanding in the future research of ADCs toward OER and to promote the further application in OER and water splitting.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>[water splitting] Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2024.100527</link>
      <description>Parisa Taherpoor, Farzaneh Farzad, Ameneh Zaboli, Results in Materials. None(None)] 2024.
In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Exploration of greatly efficient and steady non&#8208;noble oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is of great significance in improving the overall efficiency of energy density systems such as regenerative fuel cells, water electrolyzes, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, inspired by hierarchical 3D porous structures with open microchannels of natural wood, CoO@NiFe LDH sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets were anchored on the carbonized wood (CW) via electrodeposition and calcination strategies. The strong interactions between CoO nanosheets and NiFe LDH nanosheets endow CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst with high catalytic properties toward the OER comparable to CoO/CW and NiFe LDH/CW. The optimized CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst demonstrates good OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. This work presents an innovative approach to utilize renewable resources for constructing advanced free&#8208;standing catalysts.</description>

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Due to the slow reaction kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring in the anode side is regarded as the bottleneck of the overall water splitting and can only take place at a decent rate in the presence of efficient catalysts containing transition or noble metals. Given the huge demand for green hydrogen to decarbonize the energy sector and chemical industry, the global supply of metal catalysts has become a large concern. In this context, atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) have been proposed to be a promising alternative to the conventional nanoparticulate catalysts, enabling maximal utilization of metals and in the meantime good OER performance in the aqueous solutions of both alkali and acid. In view of huge potential application in the OER as well as water splitting, well-designed ADCs composing of transition metals (iron, cobalt or nickel) or noble metals (ruthenium or iridium) as active sites are summarized firstly in the current review. Next, the powerful tools in the investigation of structure-performance relationship and OER catalytic mechanism have been elaborated, including various in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculation. Finally, some challenges and perspectives for future development of ADCs are also listed, such as increasing the apparent activity, operation stability as well as possible device performance verification. The purpose of this review is to provide recent process in this field and our understanding in the future research of ADCs toward OER and to promote the further application in OER and water splitting.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

      <title>[water splitting] Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>[water splitting] Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2024.100527</link>
      <description>Parisa Taherpoor, Farzaneh Farzad, Ameneh Zaboli, Results in Materials. None(None)] 2024.
In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Exploration of greatly efficient and steady non&#8208;noble oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is of great significance in improving the overall efficiency of energy density systems such as regenerative fuel cells, water electrolyzes, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, inspired by hierarchical 3D porous structures with open microchannels of natural wood, CoO@NiFe LDH sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets were anchored on the carbonized wood (CW) via electrodeposition and calcination strategies. The strong interactions between CoO nanosheets and NiFe LDH nanosheets endow CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst with high catalytic properties toward the OER comparable to CoO/CW and NiFe LDH/CW. The optimized CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst demonstrates good OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. This work presents an innovative approach to utilize renewable resources for constructing advanced free&#8208;standing catalysts.</description>

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Due to the slow reaction kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring in the anode side is regarded as the bottleneck of the overall water splitting and can only take place at a decent rate in the presence of efficient catalysts containing transition or noble metals. Given the huge demand for green hydrogen to decarbonize the energy sector and chemical industry, the global supply of metal catalysts has become a large concern. In this context, atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) have been proposed to be a promising alternative to the conventional nanoparticulate catalysts, enabling maximal utilization of metals and in the meantime good OER performance in the aqueous solutions of both alkali and acid. In view of huge potential application in the OER as well as water splitting, well-designed ADCs composing of transition metals (iron, cobalt or nickel) or noble metals (ruthenium or iridium) as active sites are summarized firstly in the current review. Next, the powerful tools in the investigation of structure-performance relationship and OER catalytic mechanism have been elaborated, including various in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculation. Finally, some challenges and perspectives for future development of ADCs are also listed, such as increasing the apparent activity, operation stability as well as possible device performance verification. The purpose of this review is to provide recent process in this field and our understanding in the future research of ADCs toward OER and to promote the further application in OER and water splitting.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

      <title>[water splitting] Unraveling oxygen vacancy changes of WO3 photoanodes for promoting oxygen evolution reaction</title>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>[water splitting] Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rinma.2024.100527</link>
      <description>Parisa Taherpoor, Farzaneh Farzad, Ameneh Zaboli, Results in Materials. None(None)] 2024.
In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Exploration of greatly efficient and steady non&#8208;noble oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is of great significance in improving the overall efficiency of energy density systems such as regenerative fuel cells, water electrolyzes, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, inspired by hierarchical 3D porous structures with open microchannels of natural wood, CoO@NiFe LDH sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets were anchored on the carbonized wood (CW) via electrodeposition and calcination strategies. The strong interactions between CoO nanosheets and NiFe LDH nanosheets endow CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst with high catalytic properties toward the OER comparable to CoO/CW and NiFe LDH/CW. The optimized CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst demonstrates good OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. This work presents an innovative approach to utilize renewable resources for constructing advanced free&#8208;standing catalysts.</description>

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Due to the slow reaction kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring in the anode side is regarded as the bottleneck of the overall water splitting and can only take place at a decent rate in the presence of efficient catalysts containing transition or noble metals. Given the huge demand for green hydrogen to decarbonize the energy sector and chemical industry, the global supply of metal catalysts has become a large concern. In this context, atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) have been proposed to be a promising alternative to the conventional nanoparticulate catalysts, enabling maximal utilization of metals and in the meantime good OER performance in the aqueous solutions of both alkali and acid. In view of huge potential application in the OER as well as water splitting, well-designed ADCs composing of transition metals (iron, cobalt or nickel) or noble metals (ruthenium or iridium) as active sites are summarized firstly in the current review. Next, the powerful tools in the investigation of structure-performance relationship and OER catalytic mechanism have been elaborated, including various in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculation. Finally, some challenges and perspectives for future development of ADCs are also listed, such as increasing the apparent activity, operation stability as well as possible device performance verification. The purpose of this review is to provide recent process in this field and our understanding in the future research of ADCs toward OER and to promote the further application in OER and water splitting.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

0D/2D MXene@CoP2 was fabricated by hydrothermal and chemical vapor deposition phosphate methods. MXene nanosheets were employed as substrate to increase dispersion and stability of the multicomponent catalyst. The morphology of CoP2 was regulated by the addtion of Co precursor in hydrothermal process. MXene@CoP2-0.5 showed a uniform growth of CoP2 and formed aboundant reaction sites. The interfacial electron transfer between MXene and CoP2 modulated the electron structure of CoP2 and stimulated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity. The optimized MXene@CoP2-0.5 exhibited the OER overpotential of 263 mV and a long-term stability over 16 h. Modulating the interfacial electron transfer of multicomponent catalysts provided a guidance for electrocatalyst design and synthesis.</description>

Oxygen vacancy (VO) on semiconductor photoanode plays an important role in enhancing photoelectrochemical water oxidation performances. Nonetheless, there is still a lack of definitive elucidation regarding the structural changes and their impact on charge transport during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, oxygen vacancies were rationally introduced on WO3 nanoflake photoanodes via Ar-plasma engraving, resulting in a threefold increase in the photocurrent density of 2.76 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE under AM 1.5 G solar irradiation compared to the pristine WO3 photoanode. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the self-healing process of surface oxygen vacancies on WO3 photoanodes should be more easily achieved by capturing oxygen atoms from adsorbed H2O molecules. However, some survived oxygen vacancies in the subsurface could effectively increase the charge carrier density and provide the additional driving force to accelerate the interfacial charge transport, leading to enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) activities. More importantly, the oxygen vacancy self-healing on metal-oxide semiconductors is a universal phenomenon, which might bring new insights for design and construction of highly efficient photoanodes for PEC water oxidation.</description>

      <title>[water splitting] Investigation of the effects of solvent on oxygen evolution reactions on the surface of magnesium oxide</title>

In this research, due to the importance of oxygen evolution reactions (OER) in the production of hydrogen gas, the effects of the solvent on the OER steps on the magnesium oxide surface have been studied. For this purpose, the difference in free energy value in OER steps on the Magnesium oxide surface for two systems (in the presence and the absence of solvent) have been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and thermodynamic integration (TI). These results are in perfect agreement with the results obtained from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics calculations. Our findings show that the presence of water solvent around the surface of magnesium oxide has a crucial role on OER and leads to an increase more than twofold in the free energy of all steps. Also, the presence of the solvent has the most effect on the third step of OER, and its &#916;G increases by about 1.9 eV. This fact can be attributed to the approach of the water molecules to the substrate spontaneously, which increases the probability of forming hydrogen bonds and the number of contacts, leading to more favorable thermodynamic reactions. Close inspection of the calculated binding energies between the substrate and the intermediates confirms that the binding energy of OER's second step is significantly higher than the other steps and is the velocity determining step.</description>

Steady-state and time-resolved spectroelectrochemical optical absorption techniques were used to investigate photoexcited states of amorphous cobalt-phosphate oxyhydroxide (CoPi) and cobalt-borate oxyhydroxide (CoBi) oxygen evolution catalysts. These materials revealed concurrent spectroelectrochemical intensity changes in their ground state and photoexcited visible spectra, providing insights into the dynamics of defect states attributable to trapped holes. Notably, long-lived photoexcited states, assignable to hole-based defects persisting beyond 10 ms in H2O, were observed in CoPi and CoBi for the first time. Both thin films exhibited distinct dynamics, however, highlighting differences in their structural and electronic properties despite strong similarities in absorption spectral profiles. These results provide further insight into the differences between the electronic properties and dynamics of CoPi and CoBi, which have been challenging to structurally and electronically characterize due to their amorphous nature.</description>

Seawater electrolysis is one most promising development directions for future hydrogen energy. However, big challenges of active site poisoning, chloride oxidation (ClOR), and chloride corrosion on anode electrocatalysts, seriously impede seawater electrolysis development. Therefore, developing efficient anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is an urgent task for seawater electrolysis. The advanced strategies of improving OER kinetics, lowering ClOR kinetics, strengthening corrosion resistance, and recombining multifunction are summarized and analyzed to help researchers quickly grasp the recent progress on seawater oxidation. The outlooks for future research are put forward. The future research directions are proposed as internal and external cultivation, giving full play to the physicochemical properties of electrocatalysts, making sense of structure evolution and OER mechanism, and elucidating the electrical double layer of electrocatalysts. A lot of room for scalable application of seawater electrolysis calls for persistent effort and devotion of related researchers to boost seawater electrolysis development and universal hydrogen energy application.</description>

Highly active and stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for the large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. However, the dynamic reconfiguration of the catalyst surface structure and active centers is still undefined, which greatly hinders the development and application of efficient OER catalysts. Herein, we report an IrRuOx/C catalyst with a facile low&#8208;temperature synthesis route, which can reach 10 mA cm&#8208;2 at an overpotential of 217 mV with a Tafel slope as low as 39.4 mV dec&#8208;1, and yields a mass activity 61 times that of commercial IrO2/C at an overpotential of 300 mV. The lattice oxygen structure of RuOx is stabilized by the introduction of Ir species, thus greatly promoting the OER activity and durability. Further in situ Raman reveals that RuOx emerges as the active species at high potentials, and Ru&#8208;O bonding interactions are enhanced with Ir regulation, stabilizing the solvation of Ru at high potentials and accelerating the nucleophilic attack of water molecules, leading to the improved OER performance. This work deepens the fundamental understanding of OER and offers an effective way to advance the utilization of Ru&#8208;based OER catalysts.</description>

Scale-up hydrogen production from natural seawater presents a promising avenue to address the escalating depletion of fossil fuel resources. However, direct seawater splitting (DSS) remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the deficiency of efficient, stable, and cost-effective catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication of a self-supported heterostructured nanoarray electrocatalyst, namely, NiTe/Ni2P, which exhibits exceptional performance and durability in the OER in alkaline seawater conditions. Remarkably, this innovative catalyst displays an overpotential of merely 312 mV to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the overall seawater splitting (OSS) process can be achieved at a cell voltage of 1.68 V while maintaining a high faradic efficiency (FE) of nearly 100 % for the OER, alongside exceptional stability exceeding 100 h of continuous testing. We have validated the presence of heterostructures and strong interactions between NiTe and Ni2P, as well as the Cl- repelling capability resulting from the incorporation of P, which induces a more negatively charged surface. These aforementioned factors are posited as the fundamental drivers behind the catalyst's extraordinary performance and steadfastness in the OER during DSS. Moreover, this strategic approach harbors tremendous potential for the systematic development of catalysts exhibiting exceptional OER performance within the realm of DSS.</description>

Nitrogen doped carbon nanofibers (NCNFs), which are grown on carbon cloth (CC) and loaded with NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets, are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition, ammonia annealing and electrodeposition. The obtained three dimensional CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites demonstrate an overpotential of 220 mV at current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 30 mV dec&#8722;1 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), both of which are superior to those of the state-of-the-art iridium oxide catalysts. The excellent OER performances of the CC/NCNF/NiFe LDH composites may be attributed to collective contributions of large surface areas of CNFs, nitrogen doping and synergy between NCNFs and NiFe LDHs.</description>

Investigating the self-reconstruction process of MOF-supported electrodes is of significant importance for understanding the reaction mechanisms in electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By using 1,1'-ferrocenedicarboxylic acid (FcDA) as the ligand and NiFe foam (NFF) as the current collector, a self-supported T50NiFc-MOF/NFF electrode was synthesized through the introduction of triethylamine (TEA) to regulate the deprotonation process. The optimized T50NiFc-MOF/NFF exhibited excellent electrocatalytic OER performance, requiring only 217 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA cm-2, surpassing commercial RuO2. Additionally, the T50NiFc-MOF/NFF showed a remarkable electrocatalytic stability of over 70 h. The unique 2D MOF nanoarrays and strong coordination bonds between the metal and ligand in the as-prepared self-supported electrode contribute to the enrichment of electrochemical active sites and catalytic stability. Through a self-construction process, the 2D MOF nanoarrays on the electrode surface were in-situ converted into a more active metal-LDH during alkaline electrocatalysis, which played a crucial role in improving the electronic structure of the electrode, demonstrating its importance in achieving efficient OER processes.</description>

Comprehensive previous studies on electrocatalysts have found that increasing the active area of the catalyst as well as increasing the conductivity are effective methods to enhance the catalytic activity of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, we hydrothermally synthesized an innovative coral-acicular core-shell heterojunction nanomaterial with an overpotential of &#8764;150 mV and a Tafel slope of &#8764;78.6 mV dec&#8722;1 at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 by doping appropriate amounts of Fe and coupling g-C3N4. It is found that the specific surface area is 13 times higher than that of precursor Ni0.85Se, and the catalytic performance is increased by 200 %. The heterostructure of this material is demonstrated to improve the electron transport properties through energy band analysis and density functional theory (DFT) simulations, and it is found to have the best theoretical overpotential. The coral-acicular core-shell heterostructure in this work provides a valuable theoretical and practical basis for the design and development of efficient catalysts in terms of morphology and structure.</description>

Abstract Despite of urgent needs for highly stable and efficient electrochemical water&#8208;splitting devices, it remains extremely challenging to acquire highly stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts under harsh industrial conditions. Here, w e report a successful in&#8208;situ synthesis of FeCoNiMnCr high&#8208;entropy alloy (HEA) and high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) heterocatalysts via a Cr&#8208;induced spontaneous reconstruction strategy, and demonstrate that they deliver excellent ultra&#8208;stable OER electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 320 mV at 500 mA cm &#8211;2 and a negligible activity loss after maintaining at 100 mA cm &#8211;2 for 240 h. Remarkably, the heterocatalyst holds outstanding long&#8208;term stability under harsh industrial condition of 6 M KOH and 85&#176;C at a current density of as high as 500 mA cm &#8722;2 over 500 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the formation of the HEA&#8208;HEO heterostructure can provide electroactive sites possessing robust valence states to guarantee long&#8208;term stable OER process, leading to the enhancement of electroactivity. The findings of such highly stable OER heterocatalysts under industrial conditions offer a new perspective for designing and constructing efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts for practical industrial water splitting.

Exploration of greatly efficient and steady non&#8208;noble oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is of great significance in improving the overall efficiency of energy density systems such as regenerative fuel cells, water electrolyzes, and metal&#8208;air batteries. Herein, inspired by hierarchical 3D porous structures with open microchannels of natural wood, CoO@NiFe LDH sandwich&#8208;like nanosheets were anchored on the carbonized wood (CW) via electrodeposition and calcination strategies. The strong interactions between CoO nanosheets and NiFe LDH nanosheets endow CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst with high catalytic properties toward the OER comparable to CoO/CW and NiFe LDH/CW. The optimized CoO@NiFe LDH/CW electrocatalyst demonstrates good OER catalytic performance with an overpotential of 230 mV at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. This work presents an innovative approach to utilize renewable resources for constructing advanced free&#8208;standing catalysts.</description>

Electrochemical water splitting driven by renewable energy is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to produce clean hydrogen fuel. Due to the slow reaction kinetics, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurring in the anode side is regarded as the bottleneck of the overall water splitting and can only take place at a decent rate in the presence of efficient catalysts containing transition or noble metals. Given the huge demand for green hydrogen to decarbonize the energy sector and chemical industry, the global supply of metal catalysts has become a large concern. In this context, atomically dispersed catalysts (ADCs) have been proposed to be a promising alternative to the conventional nanoparticulate catalysts, enabling maximal utilization of metals and in the meantime good OER performance in the aqueous solutions of both alkali and acid. In view of huge potential application in the OER as well as water splitting, well-designed ADCs composing of transition metals (iron, cobalt or nickel) or noble metals (ruthenium or iridium) as active sites are summarized firstly in the current review. Next, the powerful tools in the investigation of structure-performance relationship and OER catalytic mechanism have been elaborated, including various in-situ characterizations and theoretical calculation. Finally, some challenges and perspectives for future development of ADCs are also listed, such as increasing the apparent activity, operation stability as well as possible device performance verification. The purpose of this review is to provide recent process in this field and our understanding in the future research of ADCs toward OER and to promote the further application in OER and water splitting.</description>

Abstract Construction of heterojunctions is an effective strategy to enhanced electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), but the structural evolution of the active phases and synergistic mechanism still lack in&#8208;depth understanding. Here, an FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 heterostructure supported on nickel foam (NF) through a two&#8208;step hydrothermal&#8208;chemical etching method is reported. In situ Raman spectroscopy study of the surface reconstruction behaviors of FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF indicates that Ni 3 S 2 can be rapidly converted to NiOOH, accompanied by the phase transition from &#945; &#8208;FeOOH to &#946; &#8208;FeOOH during the OER process. Importantly, a deep analysis of Ni&#9472;O bond reveals that the phase transition of FeOOH can regulate the lattice disorder of NiOOH for improved catalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm that NiOOH/FeOOH heterostructure possess strengthened adsorption for O&#8208;containing intermediates, as well as lower energy barrier toward the OER. As a result, FeOOH/Ni 3 S 2 /NF exhibits promising OER activity and stability in alkaline conditions, requiring an overpotential of 268 mV @ 100 mA cm &#8722;2 and long&#8208;term stability over 200 h at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new perspective for understanding the synergistic mechanism of heterogeneous electrocatalysts during the OER process.</description>

Formate has been considered an inactive molecule and thus cannot be further reduced under CO2 reduction conditions, which limits its widespread application as feedstock. Here we present an electrochemical redox conversion of formate to CO through the potential&#8208;dependent generation of carbon dioxide radical anions (CO2&#8226;&#8208;) on Fe&#8208;Co layered double hydroxides (Fe&#8208;Co LDHs) and the subsequent reduction of CO2&#8226;&#8208; to CO on Au catalysts. We present an electrodeposition protocol for the synthesis of Fe&#8208;Co LDHs with precise composition control and find that Fe1Co4 exhibits a promising potential window for CO2&#8208;&#8226; formation between 1.14 and 1.4 V and an optimized potential at 1.24 V at a neutral pH condition. We further determined the formation of CO2&#8226;&#8208; at 1.24 V via electron paramagnetic resonance and CO2 at &amp;gt; 1.4 V through differential electrochemical mass spectrometry. This work provides a redox chemistry route for converting formate into CO through a coupled slit parallel&#8208;plate electrode system.</description>

Abstract Despite the recent achievements in urea electrosynthesis from co-reduction of nitrogen wastes (such as NO 3 &#8722; ) and CO 2 , the product selectivity remains fairly mediocre due to the competing nature of the two parallel reduction reactions. Here we report a catalyst design that affords high selectivity to urea by sequentially reducing NO 3 &#8722; and CO 2 at a dynamic catalytic centre, which not only alleviates the competition issue but also facilitates C&#8722;N coupling. We exemplify this strategy on a nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst, where a spontaneous switch between NO 3 &#8722; and CO 2 reduction paths is enabled by reversible hydrogenation on the nitrogen functional groups. A high urea yield rate of 596.1 &#181;g mg &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 with a promising Faradaic efficiency of 62% is obtained. These findings, rationalized by in situ spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations, are rooted in the proton-involved dynamic catalyst evolution that mitigates overwhelming reduction of reactants and thereby minimizes the formation of side products.</description>

Electrochemical CO2 reduction is considered a promising solution to mitigate the increasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Despite the promising potential of this process, highly active catalysts are needed to enable its efficient operation. Mixed metal oxide (MMO) materials can promote the formation of a dynamic interface between a metal and its oxidized form under applied potential, resulting in a unique interaction with the reaction intermediates. We synthesized a Pd&#8211;Mo MMO with controlled size and composition and examined the effect of these properties on CO2 electroreduction. Electron microscopy images confirmed the homogeneous distribution of the synthesized Pd7Mo1 on a ZIF-8-derived porous carbon support, with sizes of &#8764;1.3 and 4.5 nm for the samples annealed at 200 and 400 &#176;C, respectively. As shown by density functional theory calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, adding 12.5 % Mo altered the electronic structure of Pd, enhancing CO desorption, and reducing the potential needed for CO production by up to &#8764;0.2 V, corresponding to a &#8764;40 % higher partial CO current density compared to pure Pd. This work demonstrates a facile MMO synthesis enabling particle size and composition control, which will facilitate the development of highly active MMO-derived nanoalloy materials for CO2 electroreduction.</description>

Abstract Single&#8208;atom catalysts possess great potential for applications in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions. Recently, the fast and low&#8208;cost preparation of highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts remains a challenge. Herein, a high&#8208;density current generated by pulsed discharge is employed for the formation of graphene aerogel anchored Cu single atom catalysts perfectly. The Cu atoms decomposed by Cu(NO 3 ) 2 &#8226;xH 2 O are fixed on graphene under the local transient high temperature and intense electromagnetic field. The activity and selectivity of formic acid are correlated with the coordinatively unsaturated Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 moieties, reaching an optimal Faradaic efficiency (93.7%) at &#8722;0.9 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In situ characterizations reveal that the asymmetric Cu&#9472;N/O structure in a pinched state displays better catalytic activity in CO 2 RR. Density functional theory results indicate that the Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 sites regulate the adsorption configuration of intermediates and lower the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of * OCHO species, thereby promoting CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion.</description>

Abstract Carbon dioxide conversion into valuable products using photocatalysis and electrocatalysis is an effective approach to mitigate global environmental issues and the energy shortages. Among the materials utilized for catalytic reduction of CO 2 , Cu-based materials are highly advantageous owing to their widespread availability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, Cu-based materials demonstrate interesting abilities in the adsorption and activation of carbon dioxide, allowing the formation of C 2+ compounds through C&#8211;C coupling process. Herein, the basic principles of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions (PCO 2 RR) and electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (ECO 2 RR) and the pathways for the generation C 2+ products are introduced. This review categorizes Cu-based materials into different groups including Cu metal, Cu oxides, Cu alloys, and Cu SACs, Cu heterojunctions based on their catalytic applications. The relationship between the Cu surfaces and their efficiency in both PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR is emphasized. Through a review of recent studies on PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR using Cu-based catalysts, the focus is on understanding the underlying reasons for the enhanced selectivity toward C 2+ products. Finally, the opportunities and challenges associated with Cu-based materials in the CO 2 catalytic reduction applications are presented, along with research directions that can guide for the design of highly active and selective Cu-based materials for CO 2 reduction processes in the future.</description>

Abstract The rising concerns about CO 2 levels in the atmosphere and energy dependency on non-renewable sources, such as fossil fuels, could find an integral solution in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. The present work explores two alternatives to the main hindering factors for this reaction, i.e., the reactor configuration and the photocatalyst utilized. A microreactor was designed and 3D printed, providing a cheap and versatile reaction platform. Three bismuth halide perovskites, Cs 3 Bi 2 Cl 9 , Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 , and Cs 4 MnBi 2 Cl 12 , were synthesized and characterized by their band gaps (E g ); Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 presented the lowest E g and was therefore chosen for further evaluation as potential CO 2 -reduction photocatalyst. Aqueous-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was achieved using this perovskite in the microreactor, obtaining CO as a reduction product with maximal production rates of 737 &#956;mol g cat -1 h -1 . The reaction system was evaluated under different flow rates and light intensities. A balance between space-time and reactant feed was found to define the behavior of CO concentration and production in the microreactor. For the light intensity, it was observed that as it increased, both CO production and concentration increased due to generating more electron-hole pairs, favoring the photocatalytic reaction. With these results, Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 perovskite immobilized in the designed microreactor demonstrates having great potential as an effective CO 2 photocatalytic reduction system.&amp;amp;#xD;</description>

Cu2O shows great potential as a catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR). However, the mechanism behind the formation of different final products from Cu2O nanostructures remains a challenge. In this study, we combine theoretical and experimental approaches to demonstrate that the full-exposed Cu sites in Cu2O (1 0 0) microcubes contribute to superior C2H4 selectivity compared to other microstructures such as Cu2O (1 1 1), (1 1 0), and (3 1 1) facets. Density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations reveal that the stronger orbital splitting between Cu 3d and O 2p orbital of Cu2O (1 0 0) facet facilitates the formation of neighboring and low valence state Cu active site, thereby enhancing *CO adsorption and C2H4 formation. These DFT results are supported by the synthesis of four kinds of Cu2O microparticles (MPs) with different exposed facets, where cubic-Cu2O with the (1 0 0) facet exhibits the highest Faradaic efficiency (61.3 %). This study has significant implications for the structural design and mechanism analysis of innovative catalysts used in ECO2RR.</description>

Several technologies are currently being applied in the maritime industry to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. An example is the implementation of an electric propulsion system with a battery charged using a renewable energy source. Meanwhile, it is important to analyze the energy demand and the quantity of emissions reduced in a vessel after installing this system. Therefore, this study focused on analyzing the energy demand and emissions produced on fishing boats, specifically the &#8220;Sandeq&#8221; fishing boats in West Sulawesi. The primary objective was to quantify the carbon dioxide emissions reduced after the conventional engine of the vessel was replaced with an electric propulsion system. Moreover, the energy demand of the boat was estimated by analyzing the daily speed, length of voyage, and engine capacity. The results showed that six batteries were required to provide the power needed for daily operation. Furthermore, the electric propulsion system was able to reduce CO2 emission by 7.94 tons annually per ship, leading to the reduction of fuel consumption and emission taxes to approximately 10 million Rupiah annually. These results were expected to encourage stakeholders to promote the transition from conventional diesel engines to electric-powered engines.</description>

Electron microscopy images confirmed the homogeneous distribution of the synthesized Pd7Mo1 on a ZIF-8-derived porous carbon support, with sizes of &#8764;1.3 and 4.5 nm for the samples annealed at 200 and 400 &#176;C, respectively. As shown by density functional theory calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, adding 12.5 % Mo altered the electronic structure of Pd, enhancing CO desorption, and reducing the potential needed for CO production by up to &#8764;0.2 V, corresponding to a &#8764;40 % higher partial CO current density compared to pure Pd. This work demonstrates a facile MMO synthesis enabling particle size and composition control, which will facilitate the development of highly active MMO-derived nanoalloy materials for CO2 electroreduction.</description>

Abstract Despite the recent achievements in urea electrosynthesis from co-reduction of nitrogen wastes (such as NO 3 &#8722; ) and CO 2 , the product selectivity remains fairly mediocre due to the competing nature of the two parallel reduction reactions. Here we report a catalyst design that affords high selectivity to urea by sequentially reducing NO 3 &#8722; and CO 2 at a dynamic catalytic centre, which not only alleviates the competition issue but also facilitates C&#8722;N coupling. We exemplify this strategy on a nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst, where a spontaneous switch between NO 3 &#8722; and CO 2 reduction paths is enabled by reversible hydrogenation on the nitrogen functional groups. A high urea yield rate of 596.1 &#181;g mg &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 with a promising Faradaic efficiency of 62% is obtained. These findings, rationalized by in situ spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations, are rooted in the proton-involved dynamic catalyst evolution that mitigates overwhelming reduction of reactants and thereby minimizes the formation of side products.</description>

Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an efficient pathway to convert CO2 into desirable products, yet its commercialization is greatly hindered by the huge energy cost due to CO2 loss and regeneration. Performing CO2RR under acidic conditions containing alkali cations can potentially address the issue, but still causes (bi)carbonate deposition at high current densities, compromising product Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) in present&#8208;day acid&#8208;fed membrane electrode assemblies. Herein, we present a strategy using a positively charged polyelectrolyte &#8212; poly(diallyldimethylammonium) immobilized on graphene oxide via electrostatic interactions to displace alkali cations. This enables a FE of ~85%, a carbon efficiency of ~93%, and an energy efficiency (EE) of ~35% for CO at 100 mA cm&#8208;2 on modified Ag catalysts in acid. In a pure&#8208;water&#8208;fed reactor, we obtained a 78% CO FE with a 30% EE at 100 mA cm&#8208;2 at 40oC . All the performance metrics are comparable to or even exceed those attained in the presence of alkali metal cations.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Regulating CHO* intermediate pathway towards the significant acceleration of photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CH4 through rGO-coated ultrafine Pd nanoparticles</title>

Tailoring catalytic reaction pathways by using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to tune the electron-hole separation channels in the active sites of noble metals for achieving ideal yield and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction of hydrocarbon fuels remains a challenge. Herein, ternary catalyst of rGO-coated SnO2-supported noble metal Pd nanoparticles (Pd4/SnO2@rGO) has been prepared by coassembly between negatively charged graphene oxide and positively charged Pd nanoparticles. By coating with ultrathin rGO, the selectivity can be shifted from CO (44.69 % for Pd4/SnO2) toward CH4 as the prevalent species, in which the Pd nanoparticles acted as catalytic sites and electron capture sites. The rGO coating reduced the recombination of the photogenerated carriers as well as optimized the band gap and reduction potential of the catalyst. The in situ spectroscopic tests and density functional theory calculations revealed that CO2 adsorbed on Pd nanoparticles selectively formed dominant low-energy CHO* intermediates because of the generation of HCOOH* intermediates, thus providing a unique reaction pathway for the reduction of CO2 to CH4. Therefore, under sunlight irradiation, the CH4 selectivity of the catalyst is enhanced to 94.1 % with a production rate of up to 77.8 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1. This work demonstrated the prospect to tune the electronic structure of Pd using rGO, which provided a strategy for enhancing the carbon dioxide reduction reaction and selectively obtaining CH4 products in photocatalytic systems.</description>

Abstract Single&#8208;atom catalysts possess great potential for applications in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions. Recently, the fast and low&#8208;cost preparation of highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts remains a challenge. Herein, a high&#8208;density current generated by pulsed discharge is employed for the formation of graphene aerogel anchored Cu single atom catalysts perfectly. The Cu atoms decomposed by Cu(NO 3 ) 2 &#8226;xH 2 O are fixed on graphene under the local transient high temperature and intense electromagnetic field. The activity and selectivity of formic acid are correlated with the coordinatively unsaturated Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 moieties, reaching an optimal Faradaic efficiency (93.7%) at &#8722;0.9 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In situ characterizations reveal that the asymmetric Cu&#9472;N/O structure in a pinched state displays better catalytic activity in CO 2 RR. Density functional theory results indicate that the Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 sites regulate the adsorption configuration of intermediates and lower the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of * OCHO species, thereby promoting CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Investigating the Impacts of Biochar Addition to Substrate on Mitigating Carbon Dioxide Emissions in Green Roofs</title>

The utilization of biochar is often heralded as a salient approach to curtailing emissions and sequestering carbon. Agricultural and forestry soils have demonstrated its efficaciousness in reducing carbon emissions; however, the urban greening industry has yet to be thoroughly researched in this regard. To address this lacuna, the present study undertook the application of biochar to the soil of an urban green roof, with the aim of ascertaining its potential to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. By studying the effects of applying BS-0%, BS-1%, BS-5%, and BS-10% biochar on green roof substrate, the study examined the carbon dioxide value over a period of 36 h encompassing both sunny and nocturnal environments. The results indicated that the addition of biochar to the soil was effective in reducing carbon emission, with all of the biochar additions demonstrating an aptitude for carbon dioxide fixation. Notably, the application of BS-1% biochar evinced a statistically significant reduction in the carbon dioxide value. Furthermore, the addition of biochar to the roof substrate was found to be crucial in controlling rainwater runoff and alleviating urban eutrophication, indirectly reducing carbon emissions. This study provides a practical and theoretical framework for the application of biochar to mitigate the urban heat island effect.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; Benefits from Superelevated CO2 While Adapting to Far-red Light Over Time</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21273/hortsci17522-23</link>
      <description>Emily J. Kennebeck, Qingguo Meng, Hortscience. 59(2)] 2024.
Compared with the ambient Earth carbon dioxide concentration (&#8776;415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), the International Space Station has superelevated carbon dioxide (&#8776;2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), which can be a stressor to certain crops. Far-red light can drive plant photosynthesis and increase extension growth and biomass. However, the effects of far-red light under superelevated carbon dioxide are unclear. We grew hydroponic mustard ( Brassica carinata ) &#8216;Amara&#8217; seedlings in four growth chambers using a randomized complete block design with two carbon dioxide concentrations (415 and 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), two lighting treatments, and two blocks at temperature and relative humidity set points of 22 &#176;C and 40%, respectively. Each growth chamber had two lighting treatments at the same total photon flux density of 200 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 . Under the same blue and green light at 50 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 each, plants received either red light at 100 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 or red + far-red light at 50 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 each. At day 15 after planting, far-red light did not influence shoot fresh or dry mass at 415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide, but decreased both parameters by 22% to 23% at 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration increased shoot fresh and dry mass 27% to 49%, regardless of the lighting treatment. Far-red light decreased leaf area by 16% at 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide, but had no effect at 415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration increased leaf area by 21% to 33%, regardless of far-red light. Regardless of the carbon dioxide concentration, far-red light promoted stem elongation and decreased chlorophyll concentrations by 39% to 42%. These responses indicate far-red light elicited a crop-specific shade avoidance response in mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217;, increasing extension growth but decreasing leaf area, thereby reducing light interception and biomass. In addition, carbon dioxide enrichment up to 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 increased the biomass of mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; but decreased the biomass of other crops, indicating crop-specific tolerance to superelevated carbon dioxide. In conclusion, mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; seedlings benefit from superelevated carbon dioxide, but exhibit growth reduction under far-red light under superelevated carbon dioxide.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Solar Water Heating: Comprehensive Review, Critical Analysis and Case Study</title>

The increasing global demand for renewable energy sources underscores the significance of Solar Water Heating Systems (SWHS), emphasizing the need for thorough research and analysis in this domain. SWHS play a pivotal role in addressing energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, making it imperative to conduct in-depth studies on their utilization. Hence, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of SWHS. It starts by explaining the principles behind these systems, including their components and classification. Moreover, this review consolidates various studies that have been conducted on SWHS to highlight both their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, a case study is conducted in which it takes into consideration important economic and environmental factors. In particular, it focuses on several scenarios present in Lebanon such as family homes, schools, restaurants hotels and gyms to estimate potential cost savings achieved through implementing SWHS as opposed to relying solely on electric heaters. Furthermore, this investigation also examines the corresponding payback period associated with adopting SWHS along with assessing the significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions possible if these systems were widely implemented. The findings of the study demonstrate that there is a direct correlation between the extent to which SWHS are utilized and both the payback period and reduction in CO2 emissions. It was observed that when SWHS are used more frequently, with a high percentage of time (Pr=0.9), significant advantages can be achieved. For instance, for different types of establishments such as family homes, schools, restaurants, hotels, and gyms, it was estimated that average payback periods would be 14.2 years, 4.6 years, 9.2 years, 4.4 years, and 5.3 years, respectively. These results indicate that adopting a greater dependency on SWHSs not only leads to quicker cost recovery but also significantly contributes towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The analysis reveals that the yearly decrease in carbon dioxide emissions per individual is 0.16 t within a household, 0.016 t per student in an educational institution, 0.04 t per customer within a dining establishment, 0.37 t for each occupied bed in a hotel accommodation, and 0.11 t per individual at a gym. This paper serves as guidelines to SWH community. Additionally, it adds a practical insights into economic and environmental issues relevant to both Lebanon and countries with similar climates.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Influence of tillage methods on carbon dioxide emissions in spring wheat crops</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/20248206006</link>

The agriculture intensification is associated with an increase in anthropogenic load on arable soils. Tillage leads to disruption of the natural process of soil formation in connection with which the soil biota activity changes and the carbon cycle is disrupted. The purpose of the study is to establish the effects of the tillage method on the carbon dioxide emission in spring wheat crops. The emission of carbon dioxide during the growing season of spring wheat varies significantly depending on the soil processing method and temperature. At the beginning of spring wheat development, the daily emission of carbon dioxide during the dump and subsurface tillage method does not exceed 36.0 and 36.2 CO 2 kg/ha using zero technology provides a reduction in production CO 2 production to 27.8 kg/ha*day. With an increase in soil temperature by July 24, the daily emission increases on a dump and subsurface background to 105.5 and 106.0 CO 2 kg/ha*day, on a zero background to 95.4 CO 2 kg/ha*day. In the future, it decreases. The total carbon losses during the dump and subsurface tillage methods are 2829 and 2793 kg/ha, the use of zero tillage technology reduces carbon losses in grain agrocenosis by 18%.</description>

The effect of conventional fuels has been investigated for its sustainable effect on the progress of power generation, the industrial sector, agriculture, and other related needs. In daily routine, the diesel engine has been identified as an essential part of the power and energy sectors. Diesel engine exhaust emissions have negatively impacted living organisms' health. Biodiesel have been identified as a sustainable fuel source that can replace traditional petroleum-based diesel fuel. The present work is to investigate using pomegranate peels to extract the pomegranate peel oil by Soxhlet apparatus and then convert it into biodiesel with the help of the transesterification process. Further, three different blending ratio mixtures with the help of pomegranate peel biodiesel (PPBD) were made on a volume basis, named PPBD 0 (FD 100%), PPBD 10 (10% biodiesel + 90% FD), and PPBD 20 (20% biodiesel + 80% FD), to check their performance and emission analysis on a single cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine. In diesel engines, the study investigated the system's performance concerning brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC). The study analyzed various emissions, including carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NOx), using a gas analyzer. The study results indicate that PPBD 20 is the most effective blending mixture in performance and emission reduction, making this fuel a potential substitute for fossil diesel.</description>

The coal-based energy consumption structure has led to high coal consumption and carbon emissions in China's iron and steel industry, and the task of coal saving and carbon reduction in the steel industry is difficult and urgent. The economic viability of various coal-saving and emission-reduction technologies, the extent of their coal-saving and emission-reduction potential, and the guidance on the adoption of advanced technologies are crucial issues that need to be addressed in the Chinese steel industry. This article employs the Energy-Production (E-P) analysis method and the Conservation Supply Curve (CSC) model incorporating coal consumption ratio coefficients to systematically analyze coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the overall iron and steel industry and its sub-processes under different scenarios. It calculates the coal-saving emission reduction costs of 32 technologies, evaluates them comprehensively based on their coal-saving and emission-reduction potentials and cost-effectiveness, and categorizes them accordingly. According to the cost of coal saving and emission reduction as the demarcation point, a total of 19 technologies are cost-effective; according to the coal-saving emission reduction potential and cost division, 32 technologies are divided into 6 categories, among which 6 technologies such as sintering waste heat recovery technology can be used as key technologies for popularization and application. Seven technologies, such as efficient preheating technology of ladle, have high cost and low potential, which can be gradually eliminated or improved and upgraded. After the comprehensive promotion of the 32 technologies, the maximum coal saving potential is about 3.453 billion GJ, the CO2 emission reduction potential is 395 million tons, the total coal consumption of the steel industry can be reduced to about 13.904 billion GJ, and the carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced to 1.179 billion tons.</description>

In recent years, achieving a decarbonized society has necessitated reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Many countries set goals to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions during each of these periods. To achieve this goal, the introduction of carbon dioxide-free Electric Vehicles will be effective. In this paper, we propose an on-grid Park &amp; Ride parking station to charge EVs with PV and WG. We also showed that the dynamic pricing case with varying electricity prices is better than the constant electricity price case. Variable prices encourage the purchase of electricity during the hours when electricity price is low. Such price cases contribute the reduction of operating costs.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Reduced Carbon Dioxide by Overexpressing EPSPS Transgene in Arabidopsis and Rice: Implications in Carbon Neutrality through Genetically Engineered Plants</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/biology13010025</link>

With the increasing challenges of climate change caused by global warming, the effective reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) becomes an urgent environmental issue for the sustainable development of human society. Previous reports indicated increased biomass in genetically engineered (GE) Arabidopsis and rice overexpressing the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene, suggesting the possibility of consuming more carbon by GE plants. However, whether overexpressing the EPSPS gene in GE plants consumes more CO2 remains a question. To address this question, we measured expression of the EPSPS gene, intercellular CO2 concentration, photosynthetic ratios, and gene expression (RNA-seq and RT-qPCR) in GE (overexpression) and non-GE (normal expression) Arabidopsis and rice plants. Results showed substantially increased EPSPS expression accompanied with CO2 consumption in the GE Arabidopsis and rice plants. Furthermore, overexpressing the EPSPS gene affected carbon-fixation related biological pathways. We also confirmed significant upregulation of four key carbon-fixation associated genes, in addition to increased photosynthetic ratios, in all GE plants. Our finding of significantly enhanced carbon fixation in GE plants overexpressing the EPSPS transgene provides a novel strategy to reduce global CO2 for carbon neutrality by genetic engineering of plant species, in addition to increased plant production by enhanced photosynthesis.</description>

The development of floating photovoltaic systems in Romania can help to the share of more than 30.7 % of the total energy produced from renewable energy sources set for the year 2030. Floating photovoltaic plants ensure the achievement of overall energy targets without affecting biodiversity and/or agricultural crops. This study evaluates the insolation and the possibility of installing this technology on Lake F&#259;c&#259;u, Romania, to benefit from the generation of electricity but also better water quality and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$. The obtained results are promising as Floating photovoltaic plants covering around 0.22 % of the lake surface, provide 26.76 $M W h /$ year and the estimated reduction of CO &lt;inf xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt; emission is 7.52 $\mathbf{t C O}_{2 \mathrm{eq}} /$ year.</description>

Traditional cooling strategies for greenhouses commonly result in significant electricity consumption and a substantial release of carbon dioxide emissions. Considering the industrial fabrication process for the greenhouse covering film and the thermal management theory, we developed a composite greenhouse covering film that incorporates titanium dioxide into polyethylene to achieve near-infrared reflection. The film demonstrates an impressive near-infrared reflectance of 54.4% within the wavelength range of 780&#8211;2500 nm. A tunnel-type greenhouse demo comparative test results show that the composite film can effectively decrease the average temperature inside the greenhouse by 6.7 &#176;C in comparison to the pure polyethylene film. The reduction implies a significant annual saving in cooling electricity at the national level of 2151912.3 MW h, along with an annual CO2 emission reduction by 1250261.1 tons.</description>

Reaching net-zero emissions by the middle of this century requires the implementation of massive carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction strategies along with the reduction of other greenhouse gases on both global and country scales. Thus, carbon capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU) is a promising technology in combination with renewable energy transition. Currently, CO2 utilization has attracted much attention from the scientific community worldwide, since it can improve the economic viability of CCSU deployment by creating a market for the recovered CO2 stream. In this study, a brief assessment and comparison of potential CO2 utilization pathways in Uzbekistan, including CO2-to-chemical/fuel conversion, CO2 bio-fixation/mineralization, and the direct use of CO2, such as for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery (EHR), are conducted considering the CO2 stationary sources and site-specific conditions of the country. In addition, possible challenges and opportunities for large-scale CO2 utilization routes are also discussed. According to this assessment, there is great potential for the direct use of CO2 as a process-boosting agent for EHR in more than 22 major natural gas, crude oil, and coal reservoirs. Moreover, methanol and urea production processes can also create huge market demand for recovered CO2 as long as the conventional CO2 production processes are replaced by sustainable ones.</description>

Abstract Carbon dioxide conversion into valuable products using photocatalysis and electrocatalysis is an effective approach to mitigate global environmental issues and the energy shortages. Among the materials utilized for catalytic reduction of CO 2 , Cu-based materials are highly advantageous owing to their widespread availability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, Cu-based materials demonstrate interesting abilities in the adsorption and activation of carbon dioxide, allowing the formation of C 2+ compounds through C&#8211;C coupling process. Herein, the basic principles of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions (PCO 2 RR) and electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (ECO 2 RR) and the pathways for the generation C 2+ products are introduced. This review categorizes Cu-based materials into different groups including Cu metal, Cu oxides, Cu alloys, and Cu SACs, Cu heterojunctions based on their catalytic applications. The relationship between the Cu surfaces and their efficiency in both PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR is emphasized. Through a review of recent studies on PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR using Cu-based catalysts, the focus is on understanding the underlying reasons for the enhanced selectivity toward C 2+ products. Finally, the opportunities and challenges associated with Cu-based materials in the CO 2 catalytic reduction applications are presented, along with research directions that can guide for the design of highly active and selective Cu-based materials for CO 2 reduction processes in the future.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Reusable and Disposable Distribution Packaging for Fresh Food</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20909/kopast.2023.29.3.181</link>
      <description>Kim Sy, CHAROENSRI KORAKOT, Shin Yj, Park Hj, Han-gug pojang hag-hoeji. 29(3)] 2023.
In this study, we conducted a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of two different products, considering reusable and single-use packaging for fresh food distribution. For reusable packaging, we utilized expanded polyethylene (EPE), while for comparison, a disposable box made of widely used expanded polystyrene (EPS) was selected. We comprehensively analyzed the environmental impacts of production, transportation, reprocessing (for reused boxes), and disposal across 18 impact categories. Upon analyzing the actual reuse of 300 rounds of fresh food, the cumulative global warming potential (GWP) values for the EPE box were found to be 280.21 kg carbon dioxide (CO2) eq, demonstrating a significant 75% reduction compared to those of the EPS box. Furthermore, it was observed that the GWP values for the EPE boxes became equivalent to those of the EPS boxes after 12 rounds of reuse. In conclusion, reusable packaging shows substantial potential to contribute to the reduction of environmental burdens, aligning well with global environmental requirements for sustainable food distribution and related industries.</description>

Reducing food losses and waste is of significant importance in a world where the number of people suffering from hunger is increasing, especially after 2014. Food waste leads to ecological issues, including carbon dioxide emissions that exacerbate global warming, and it can also result in social and economic problems. It is also crucial to consider force majeure circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Russian invasion, and the declaration of martial law in Ukraine. Studying and adapting the Ukrainian experience in managing food waste during force majeure situations can be beneficial for other countries in reducing and processing food losses and waste globally. This article is an interim outcome of the UUT17 project (Research Project No. 1877-01/17) "Evaluation of opportunities for prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse of FLW in Ukraine".</description>

In the present situation, steel-making industries have turned their attention towards producing quality steel, through more feasible routes. One of the routes is the production of green steel, which is a kind of steel produced through a process which reduces the emission of carbon dioxide. Steel produced through traditional methods relies heavily on fossil fuel and coal, emitting large amounts of CO2, resulting in 6 &#8211; 7 % of global greenhouse gas emissions. Eventually, steel production using blast furnaces requires coking coal, which has limited reserves in India. An alternative approach to this is the utilization of DRI which consumes either non-coking coal or Hydrogen for its reduction, which significantly reduces carbon emission. To produce clean steel, it is necessary to undergo a complete assessment of the Non-Metallic Inclusions (NMI). Often, Types, sizes and distribution of Non-Metallic Inclusions play a major role in the steel properties. The present study has been performed to investigate the inclusion rating of steel produced from hydrogen-based DRI (HDRI) during steel making in an Induction Furnace (IF) and carbon-based DRI to understand the cleanness of steel as per ASTM E-45 standard. The kinetics of inclusion formation during steel making in induction furnaces has been studied using Classical Nucleation Theory. Thermodynamic modelling of different types of inclusion formation was carried out using the Fact Sage software package and it has been validated experimentally with the inclusion classifier of the SEM/EDS analyzer.</description>

Abstract The rising concerns about CO 2 levels in the atmosphere and energy dependency on non-renewable sources, such as fossil fuels, could find an integral solution in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. The present work explores two alternatives to the main hindering factors for this reaction, i.e., the reactor configuration and the photocatalyst utilized. A microreactor was designed and 3D printed, providing a cheap and versatile reaction platform. Three bismuth halide perovskites, Cs 3 Bi 2 Cl 9 , Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 , and Cs 4 MnBi 2 Cl 12 , were synthesized and characterized by their band gaps (E g ); Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 presented the lowest E g and was therefore chosen for further evaluation as potential CO 2 -reduction photocatalyst. Aqueous-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was achieved using this perovskite in the microreactor, obtaining CO as a reduction product with maximal production rates of 737 &#956;mol g cat -1 h -1 . The reaction system was evaluated under different flow rates and light intensities. A balance between space-time and reactant feed was found to define the behavior of CO concentration and production in the microreactor. For the light intensity, it was observed that as it increased, both CO production and concentration increased due to generating more electron-hole pairs, favoring the photocatalytic reaction. With these results, Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 perovskite immobilized in the designed microreactor demonstrates having great potential as an effective CO 2 photocatalytic reduction system.&amp;amp;#xD;</description>

Cu2O shows great potential as a catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR). However, the mechanism behind the formation of different final products from Cu2O nanostructures remains a challenge. In this study, we combine theoretical and experimental approaches to demonstrate that the full-exposed Cu sites in Cu2O (1 0 0) microcubes contribute to superior C2H4 selectivity compared to other microstructures such as Cu2O (1 1 1), (1 1 0), and (3 1 1) facets. Density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations reveal that the stronger orbital splitting between Cu 3d and O 2p orbital of Cu2O (1 0 0) facet facilitates the formation of neighboring and low valence state Cu active site, thereby enhancing *CO adsorption and C2H4 formation. These DFT results are supported by the synthesis of four kinds of Cu2O microparticles (MPs) with different exposed facets, where cubic-Cu2O with the (1 0 0) facet exhibits the highest Faradaic efficiency (61.3 %). This study has significant implications for the structural design and mechanism analysis of innovative catalysts used in ECO2RR.</description>

Several technologies are currently being applied in the maritime industry to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. An example is the implementation of an electric propulsion system with a battery charged using a renewable energy source. Meanwhile, it is important to analyze the energy demand and the quantity of emissions reduced in a vessel after installing this system. Therefore, this study focused on analyzing the energy demand and emissions produced on fishing boats, specifically the &#8220;Sandeq&#8221; fishing boats in West Sulawesi. The primary objective was to quantify the carbon dioxide emissions reduced after the conventional engine of the vessel was replaced with an electric propulsion system. Moreover, the energy demand of the boat was estimated by analyzing the daily speed, length of voyage, and engine capacity. The results showed that six batteries were required to provide the power needed for daily operation. Furthermore, the electric propulsion system was able to reduce CO2 emission by 7.94 tons annually per ship, leading to the reduction of fuel consumption and emission taxes to approximately 10 million Rupiah annually. These results were expected to encourage stakeholders to promote the transition from conventional diesel engines to electric-powered engines.</description>

Electrochemical CO2 reduction is considered a promising solution to mitigate the increasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Despite the promising potential of this process, highly active catalysts are needed to enable its efficient operation. Mixed metal oxide (MMO) materials can promote the formation of a dynamic interface between a metal and its oxidized form under applied potential, resulting in a unique interaction with the reaction intermediates. We synthesized a Pd&#8211;Mo MMO with controlled size and composition and examined the effect of these properties on CO2 electroreduction. Electron microscopy images confirmed the homogeneous distribution of the synthesized Pd7Mo1 on a ZIF-8-derived porous carbon support, with sizes of &#8764;1.3 and 4.5 nm for the samples annealed at 200 and 400 &#176;C, respectively. As shown by density functional theory calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, adding 12.5 % Mo altered the electronic structure of Pd, enhancing CO desorption, and reducing the potential needed for CO production by up to &#8764;0.2 V, corresponding to a &#8764;40 % higher partial CO current density compared to pure Pd. This work demonstrates a facile MMO synthesis enabling particle size and composition control, which will facilitate the development of highly active MMO-derived nanoalloy materials for CO2 electroreduction.</description>

Abstract Despite the recent achievements in urea electrosynthesis from co-reduction of nitrogen wastes (such as NO 3 &#8722; ) and CO 2 , the product selectivity remains fairly mediocre due to the competing nature of the two parallel reduction reactions. Here we report a catalyst design that affords high selectivity to urea by sequentially reducing NO 3 &#8722; and CO 2 at a dynamic catalytic centre, which not only alleviates the competition issue but also facilitates C&#8722;N coupling. We exemplify this strategy on a nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst, where a spontaneous switch between NO 3 &#8722; and CO 2 reduction paths is enabled by reversible hydrogenation on the nitrogen functional groups. A high urea yield rate of 596.1 &#181;g mg &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 with a promising Faradaic efficiency of 62% is obtained. These findings, rationalized by in situ spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations, are rooted in the proton-involved dynamic catalyst evolution that mitigates overwhelming reduction of reactants and thereby minimizes the formation of side products.</description>

Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an efficient pathway to convert CO2 into desirable products, yet its commercialization is greatly hindered by the huge energy cost due to CO2 loss and regeneration. Performing CO2RR under acidic conditions containing alkali cations can potentially address the issue, but still causes (bi)carbonate deposition at high current densities, compromising product Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) in present&#8208;day acid&#8208;fed membrane electrode assemblies. Herein, we present a strategy using a positively charged polyelectrolyte &#8212; poly(diallyldimethylammonium) immobilized on graphene oxide via electrostatic interactions to displace alkali cations. This enables a FE of ~85%, a carbon efficiency of ~93%, and an energy efficiency (EE) of ~35% for CO at 100 mA cm&#8208;2 on modified Ag catalysts in acid. In a pure&#8208;water&#8208;fed reactor, we obtained a 78% CO FE with a 30% EE at 100 mA cm&#8208;2 at 40oC . All the performance metrics are comparable to or even exceed those attained in the presence of alkali metal cations.</description>

Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an efficient pathway to convert CO2 into desirable products, yet its commercialization is greatly hindered by the huge energy cost due to CO2 loss and regeneration. Performing CO2RR under acidic conditions containing alkali cations can potentially address the issue, but still causes (bi)carbonate deposition at high current densities, compromising product Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) in present&#8208;day acid&#8208;fed membrane electrode assemblies. Herein, we present a strategy using a positively charged polyelectrolyte &#8212; poly(diallyldimethylammonium) immobilized on graphene oxide via electrostatic interactions to displace alkali cations. This enables a FE of ~85%, a carbon efficiency of ~93%, and an energy efficiency (EE) of ~35% for CO at 100 mA cm&#8208;2 on modified Ag catalysts in acid. In a pure&#8208;water&#8208;fed reactor, we obtained a 78% CO FE with a 30% EE at 100 mA cm&#8208;2 at 40oC . All the performance metrics are comparable to or even exceed those attained in the presence of alkali metal cations.</description>

Tailoring catalytic reaction pathways by using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to tune the electron-hole separation channels in the active sites of noble metals for achieving ideal yield and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction of hydrocarbon fuels remains a challenge. Herein, ternary catalyst of rGO-coated SnO2-supported noble metal Pd nanoparticles (Pd4/SnO2@rGO) has been prepared by coassembly between negatively charged graphene oxide and positively charged Pd nanoparticles. By coating with ultrathin rGO, the selectivity can be shifted from CO (44.69 % for Pd4/SnO2) toward CH4 as the prevalent species, in which the Pd nanoparticles acted as catalytic sites and electron capture sites. The rGO coating reduced the recombination of the photogenerated carriers as well as optimized the band gap and reduction potential of the catalyst. The in situ spectroscopic tests and density functional theory calculations revealed that CO2 adsorbed on Pd nanoparticles selectively formed dominant low-energy CHO* intermediates because of the generation of HCOOH* intermediates, thus providing a unique reaction pathway for the reduction of CO2 to CH4. Therefore, under sunlight irradiation, the CH4 selectivity of the catalyst is enhanced to 94.1 % with a production rate of up to 77.8 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1. This work demonstrated the prospect to tune the electronic structure of Pd using rGO, which provided a strategy for enhancing the carbon dioxide reduction reaction and selectively obtaining CH4 products in photocatalytic systems.</description>

Abstract Single&#8208;atom catalysts possess great potential for applications in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions. Recently, the fast and low&#8208;cost preparation of highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts remains a challenge. Herein, a high&#8208;density current generated by pulsed discharge is employed for the formation of graphene aerogel anchored Cu single atom catalysts perfectly. The Cu atoms decomposed by Cu(NO 3 ) 2 &#8226;xH 2 O are fixed on graphene under the local transient high temperature and intense electromagnetic field. The activity and selectivity of formic acid are correlated with the coordinatively unsaturated Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 moieties, reaching an optimal Faradaic efficiency (93.7%) at &#8722;0.9 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In situ characterizations reveal that the asymmetric Cu&#9472;N/O structure in a pinched state displays better catalytic activity in CO 2 RR. Density functional theory results indicate that the Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 sites regulate the adsorption configuration of intermediates and lower the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of * OCHO species, thereby promoting CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion.</description>

The utilization of biochar is often heralded as a salient approach to curtailing emissions and sequestering carbon. Agricultural and forestry soils have demonstrated its efficaciousness in reducing carbon emissions; however, the urban greening industry has yet to be thoroughly researched in this regard. To address this lacuna, the present study undertook the application of biochar to the soil of an urban green roof, with the aim of ascertaining its potential to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. By studying the effects of applying BS-0%, BS-1%, BS-5%, and BS-10% biochar on green roof substrate, the study examined the carbon dioxide value over a period of 36 h encompassing both sunny and nocturnal environments. The results indicated that the addition of biochar to the soil was effective in reducing carbon emission, with all of the biochar additions demonstrating an aptitude for carbon dioxide fixation. Notably, the application of BS-1% biochar evinced a statistically significant reduction in the carbon dioxide value. Furthermore, the addition of biochar to the roof substrate was found to be crucial in controlling rainwater runoff and alleviating urban eutrophication, indirectly reducing carbon emissions. This study provides a practical and theoretical framework for the application of biochar to mitigate the urban heat island effect.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; Benefits from Superelevated CO2 While Adapting to Far-red Light Over Time</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21273/hortsci17522-23</link>
      <description>Emily J. Kennebeck, Qingguo Meng, Hortscience. 59(2)] 2024.
Compared with the ambient Earth carbon dioxide concentration (&#8776;415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), the International Space Station has superelevated carbon dioxide (&#8776;2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), which can be a stressor to certain crops. Far-red light can drive plant photosynthesis and increase extension growth and biomass. However, the effects of far-red light under superelevated carbon dioxide are unclear. We grew hydroponic mustard ( Brassica carinata ) &#8216;Amara&#8217; seedlings in four growth chambers using a randomized complete block design with two carbon dioxide concentrations (415 and 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), two lighting treatments, and two blocks at temperature and relative humidity set points of 22 &#176;C and 40%, respectively. Each growth chamber had two lighting treatments at the same total photon flux density of 200 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 . Under the same blue and green light at 50 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 each, plants received either red light at 100 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 or red + far-red light at 50 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 each. At day 15 after planting, far-red light did not influence shoot fresh or dry mass at 415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide, but decreased both parameters by 22% to 23% at 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration increased shoot fresh and dry mass 27% to 49%, regardless of the lighting treatment. Far-red light decreased leaf area by 16% at 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide, but had no effect at 415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration increased leaf area by 21% to 33%, regardless of far-red light. Regardless of the carbon dioxide concentration, far-red light promoted stem elongation and decreased chlorophyll concentrations by 39% to 42%. These responses indicate far-red light elicited a crop-specific shade avoidance response in mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217;, increasing extension growth but decreasing leaf area, thereby reducing light interception and biomass. In addition, carbon dioxide enrichment up to 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 increased the biomass of mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; but decreased the biomass of other crops, indicating crop-specific tolerance to superelevated carbon dioxide. In conclusion, mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; seedlings benefit from superelevated carbon dioxide, but exhibit growth reduction under far-red light under superelevated carbon dioxide.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Solar Water Heating: Comprehensive Review, Critical Analysis and Case Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.52843/cassyni.z0lx6v</link>
      <description>Amal Herez, No host. None(None)] 2023.
The increasing global demand for renewable energy sources underscores the significance of Solar Water Heating Systems (SWHS), emphasizing the need for thorough research and analysis in this domain. SWHS play a pivotal role in addressing energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, making it imperative to conduct in-depth studies on their utilization. Hence, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of SWHS. It starts by explaining the principles behind these systems, including their components and classification. Moreover, this review consolidates various studies that have been conducted on SWHS to highlight both their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, a case study is conducted in which it takes into consideration important economic and environmental factors. In particular, it focuses on several scenarios present in Lebanon such as family homes, schools, restaurants hotels and gyms to estimate potential cost savings achieved through implementing SWHS as opposed to relying solely on electric heaters. Furthermore, this investigation also examines the corresponding payback period associated with adopting SWHS along with assessing the significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions possible if these systems were widely implemented. The findings of the study demonstrate that there is a direct correlation between the extent to which SWHS are utilized and both the payback period and reduction in CO2 emissions. It was observed that when SWHS are used more frequently, with a high percentage of time (Pr=0.9), significant advantages can be achieved. For instance, for different types of establishments such as family homes, schools, restaurants, hotels, and gyms, it was estimated that average payback periods would be 14.2 years, 4.6 years, 9.2 years, 4.4 years, and 5.3 years, respectively. These results indicate that adopting a greater dependency on SWHSs not only leads to quicker cost recovery but also significantly contributes towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The analysis reveals that the yearly decrease in carbon dioxide emissions per individual is 0.16 t within a household, 0.016 t per student in an educational institution, 0.04 t per customer within a dining establishment, 0.37 t for each occupied bed in a hotel accommodation, and 0.11 t per individual at a gym. This paper serves as guidelines to SWH community. Additionally, it adds a practical insights into economic and environmental issues relevant to both Lebanon and countries with similar climates.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Influence of tillage methods on carbon dioxide emissions in spring wheat crops</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/20248206006</link>

The agriculture intensification is associated with an increase in anthropogenic load on arable soils. Tillage leads to disruption of the natural process of soil formation in connection with which the soil biota activity changes and the carbon cycle is disrupted. The purpose of the study is to establish the effects of the tillage method on the carbon dioxide emission in spring wheat crops. The emission of carbon dioxide during the growing season of spring wheat varies significantly depending on the soil processing method and temperature. At the beginning of spring wheat development, the daily emission of carbon dioxide during the dump and subsurface tillage method does not exceed 36.0 and 36.2 CO 2 kg/ha using zero technology provides a reduction in production CO 2 production to 27.8 kg/ha*day. With an increase in soil temperature by July 24, the daily emission increases on a dump and subsurface background to 105.5 and 106.0 CO 2 kg/ha*day, on a zero background to 95.4 CO 2 kg/ha*day. In the future, it decreases. The total carbon losses during the dump and subsurface tillage methods are 2829 and 2793 kg/ha, the use of zero tillage technology reduces carbon losses in grain agrocenosis by 18%.</description>

The effect of conventional fuels has been investigated for its sustainable effect on the progress of power generation, the industrial sector, agriculture, and other related needs. In daily routine, the diesel engine has been identified as an essential part of the power and energy sectors. Diesel engine exhaust emissions have negatively impacted living organisms' health. Biodiesel have been identified as a sustainable fuel source that can replace traditional petroleum-based diesel fuel. The present work is to investigate using pomegranate peels to extract the pomegranate peel oil by Soxhlet apparatus and then convert it into biodiesel with the help of the transesterification process. Further, three different blending ratio mixtures with the help of pomegranate peel biodiesel (PPBD) were made on a volume basis, named PPBD 0 (FD 100%), PPBD 10 (10% biodiesel + 90% FD), and PPBD 20 (20% biodiesel + 80% FD), to check their performance and emission analysis on a single cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine. In diesel engines, the study investigated the system's performance concerning brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC). The study analyzed various emissions, including carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NOx), using a gas analyzer. The study results indicate that PPBD 20 is the most effective blending mixture in performance and emission reduction, making this fuel a potential substitute for fossil diesel.</description>

The coal-based energy consumption structure has led to high coal consumption and carbon emissions in China's iron and steel industry, and the task of coal saving and carbon reduction in the steel industry is difficult and urgent. The economic viability of various coal-saving and emission-reduction technologies, the extent of their coal-saving and emission-reduction potential, and the guidance on the adoption of advanced technologies are crucial issues that need to be addressed in the Chinese steel industry. This article employs the Energy-Production (E-P) analysis method and the Conservation Supply Curve (CSC) model incorporating coal consumption ratio coefficients to systematically analyze coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the overall iron and steel industry and its sub-processes under different scenarios. It calculates the coal-saving emission reduction costs of 32 technologies, evaluates them comprehensively based on their coal-saving and emission-reduction potentials and cost-effectiveness, and categorizes them accordingly. According to the cost of coal saving and emission reduction as the demarcation point, a total of 19 technologies are cost-effective; according to the coal-saving emission reduction potential and cost division, 32 technologies are divided into 6 categories, among which 6 technologies such as sintering waste heat recovery technology can be used as key technologies for popularization and application. Seven technologies, such as efficient preheating technology of ladle, have high cost and low potential, which can be gradually eliminated or improved and upgraded. After the comprehensive promotion of the 32 technologies, the maximum coal saving potential is about 3.453 billion GJ, the CO2 emission reduction potential is 395 million tons, the total coal consumption of the steel industry can be reduced to about 13.904 billion GJ, and the carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced to 1.179 billion tons.</description>

In recent years, achieving a decarbonized society has necessitated reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Many countries set goals to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions during each of these periods. To achieve this goal, the introduction of carbon dioxide-free Electric Vehicles will be effective. In this paper, we propose an on-grid Park &amp; Ride parking station to charge EVs with PV and WG. We also showed that the dynamic pricing case with varying electricity prices is better than the constant electricity price case. Variable prices encourage the purchase of electricity during the hours when electricity price is low. Such price cases contribute the reduction of operating costs.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Reduced Carbon Dioxide by Overexpressing EPSPS Transgene in Arabidopsis and Rice: Implications in Carbon Neutrality through Genetically Engineered Plants</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/biology13010025</link>
      <description>Lulong Sun, Ning Li, Zhen Yuan, Ying Wang, Bao&#8208;Rong Lu, Biology. 13(1)] 2023.
With the increasing challenges of climate change caused by global warming, the effective reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) becomes an urgent environmental issue for the sustainable development of human society. Previous reports indicated increased biomass in genetically engineered (GE) Arabidopsis and rice overexpressing the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene, suggesting the possibility of consuming more carbon by GE plants. However, whether overexpressing the EPSPS gene in GE plants consumes more CO2 remains a question. To address this question, we measured expression of the EPSPS gene, intercellular CO2 concentration, photosynthetic ratios, and gene expression (RNA-seq and RT-qPCR) in GE (overexpression) and non-GE (normal expression) Arabidopsis and rice plants. Results showed substantially increased EPSPS expression accompanied with CO2 consumption in the GE Arabidopsis and rice plants. Furthermore, overexpressing the EPSPS gene affected carbon-fixation related biological pathways. We also confirmed significant upregulation of four key carbon-fixation associated genes, in addition to increased photosynthetic ratios, in all GE plants. Our finding of significantly enhanced carbon fixation in GE plants overexpressing the EPSPS transgene provides a novel strategy to reduce global CO2 for carbon neutrality by genetic engineering of plant species, in addition to increased plant production by enhanced photosynthesis.</description>

The development of floating photovoltaic systems in Romania can help to the share of more than 30.7 % of the total energy produced from renewable energy sources set for the year 2030. Floating photovoltaic plants ensure the achievement of overall energy targets without affecting biodiversity and/or agricultural crops. This study evaluates the insolation and the possibility of installing this technology on Lake F&#259;c&#259;u, Romania, to benefit from the generation of electricity but also better water quality and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$. The obtained results are promising as Floating photovoltaic plants covering around 0.22 % of the lake surface, provide 26.76 $M W h /$ year and the estimated reduction of CO &lt;inf xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt; emission is 7.52 $\mathbf{t C O}_{2 \mathrm{eq}} /$ year.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Near-Infrared Reflective Greenhouse Covering: A Novel Strategy for Electricity-Free Cooling</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsagscitech.3c00281</link>

Traditional cooling strategies for greenhouses commonly result in significant electricity consumption and a substantial release of carbon dioxide emissions. Considering the industrial fabrication process for the greenhouse covering film and the thermal management theory, we developed a composite greenhouse covering film that incorporates titanium dioxide into polyethylene to achieve near-infrared reflection. The film demonstrates an impressive near-infrared reflectance of 54.4% within the wavelength range of 780&#8211;2500 nm. A tunnel-type greenhouse demo comparative test results show that the composite film can effectively decrease the average temperature inside the greenhouse by 6.7 &#176;C in comparison to the pure polyethylene film. The reduction implies a significant annual saving in cooling electricity at the national level of 2151912.3 MW h, along with an annual CO2 emission reduction by 1250261.1 tons.</description>

Reaching net-zero emissions by the middle of this century requires the implementation of massive carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction strategies along with the reduction of other greenhouse gases on both global and country scales. Thus, carbon capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU) is a promising technology in combination with renewable energy transition. Currently, CO2 utilization has attracted much attention from the scientific community worldwide, since it can improve the economic viability of CCSU deployment by creating a market for the recovered CO2 stream. In this study, a brief assessment and comparison of potential CO2 utilization pathways in Uzbekistan, including CO2-to-chemical/fuel conversion, CO2 bio-fixation/mineralization, and the direct use of CO2, such as for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery (EHR), are conducted considering the CO2 stationary sources and site-specific conditions of the country. In addition, possible challenges and opportunities for large-scale CO2 utilization routes are also discussed. According to this assessment, there is great potential for the direct use of CO2 as a process-boosting agent for EHR in more than 22 major natural gas, crude oil, and coal reservoirs. Moreover, methanol and urea production processes can also create huge market demand for recovered CO2 as long as the conventional CO2 production processes are replaced by sustainable ones.</description>

Abstract Carbon dioxide conversion into valuable products using photocatalysis and electrocatalysis is an effective approach to mitigate global environmental issues and the energy shortages. Among the materials utilized for catalytic reduction of CO 2 , Cu-based materials are highly advantageous owing to their widespread availability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, Cu-based materials demonstrate interesting abilities in the adsorption and activation of carbon dioxide, allowing the formation of C 2+ compounds through C&#8211;C coupling process. Herein, the basic principles of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions (PCO 2 RR) and electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (ECO 2 RR) and the pathways for the generation C 2+ products are introduced. This review categorizes Cu-based materials into different groups including Cu metal, Cu oxides, Cu alloys, and Cu SACs, Cu heterojunctions based on their catalytic applications. The relationship between the Cu surfaces and their efficiency in both PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR is emphasized. Through a review of recent studies on PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR using Cu-based catalysts, the focus is on understanding the underlying reasons for the enhanced selectivity toward C 2+ products. Finally, the opportunities and challenges associated with Cu-based materials in the CO 2 catalytic reduction applications are presented, along with research directions that can guide for the design of highly active and selective Cu-based materials for CO 2 reduction processes in the future.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Comparative Life Cycle Assessment of Reusable and Disposable Distribution Packaging for Fresh Food</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.20909/kopast.2023.29.3.181</link>
      <description>Kim Sy, CHAROENSRI KORAKOT, Shin Yj, Park Hj, Han-gug pojang hag-hoeji. 29(3)] 2023.
In this study, we conducted a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of two different products, considering reusable and single-use packaging for fresh food distribution. For reusable packaging, we utilized expanded polyethylene (EPE), while for comparison, a disposable box made of widely used expanded polystyrene (EPS) was selected. We comprehensively analyzed the environmental impacts of production, transportation, reprocessing (for reused boxes), and disposal across 18 impact categories. Upon analyzing the actual reuse of 300 rounds of fresh food, the cumulative global warming potential (GWP) values for the EPE box were found to be 280.21 kg carbon dioxide (CO2) eq, demonstrating a significant 75% reduction compared to those of the EPS box. Furthermore, it was observed that the GWP values for the EPE boxes became equivalent to those of the EPS boxes after 12 rounds of reuse. In conclusion, reusable packaging shows substantial potential to contribute to the reduction of environmental burdens, aligning well with global environmental requirements for sustainable food distribution and related industries.</description>

Reducing food losses and waste is of significant importance in a world where the number of people suffering from hunger is increasing, especially after 2014. Food waste leads to ecological issues, including carbon dioxide emissions that exacerbate global warming, and it can also result in social and economic problems. It is also crucial to consider force majeure circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Russian invasion, and the declaration of martial law in Ukraine. Studying and adapting the Ukrainian experience in managing food waste during force majeure situations can be beneficial for other countries in reducing and processing food losses and waste globally. This article is an interim outcome of the UUT17 project (Research Project No. 1877-01/17) "Evaluation of opportunities for prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse of FLW in Ukraine".</description>

In the present situation, steel-making industries have turned their attention towards producing quality steel, through more feasible routes. One of the routes is the production of green steel, which is a kind of steel produced through a process which reduces the emission of carbon dioxide. Steel produced through traditional methods relies heavily on fossil fuel and coal, emitting large amounts of CO2, resulting in 6 &#8211; 7 % of global greenhouse gas emissions. Eventually, steel production using blast furnaces requires coking coal, which has limited reserves in India. An alternative approach to this is the utilization of DRI which consumes either non-coking coal or Hydrogen for its reduction, which significantly reduces carbon emission. To produce clean steel, it is necessary to undergo a complete assessment of the Non-Metallic Inclusions (NMI). Often, Types, sizes and distribution of Non-Metallic Inclusions play a major role in the steel properties. The present study has been performed to investigate the inclusion rating of steel produced from hydrogen-based DRI (HDRI) during steel making in an Induction Furnace (IF) and carbon-based DRI to understand the cleanness of steel as per ASTM E-45 standard. The kinetics of inclusion formation during steel making in induction furnaces has been studied using Classical Nucleation Theory. Thermodynamic modelling of different types of inclusion formation was carried out using the Fact Sage software package and it has been validated experimentally with the inclusion classifier of the SEM/EDS analyzer.</description>

Abstract The rising concerns about CO 2 levels in the atmosphere and energy dependency on non-renewable sources, such as fossil fuels, could find an integral solution in CO 2 photocatalytic reduction. The present work explores two alternatives to the main hindering factors for this reaction, i.e., the reactor configuration and the photocatalyst utilized. A microreactor was designed and 3D printed, providing a cheap and versatile reaction platform. Three bismuth halide perovskites, Cs 3 Bi 2 Cl 9 , Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 , and Cs 4 MnBi 2 Cl 12 , were synthesized and characterized by their band gaps (E g ); Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 presented the lowest E g and was therefore chosen for further evaluation as potential CO 2 -reduction photocatalyst. Aqueous-phase photocatalytic CO 2 reduction was achieved using this perovskite in the microreactor, obtaining CO as a reduction product with maximal production rates of 737 &#956;mol g cat -1 h -1 . The reaction system was evaluated under different flow rates and light intensities. A balance between space-time and reactant feed was found to define the behavior of CO concentration and production in the microreactor. For the light intensity, it was observed that as it increased, both CO production and concentration increased due to generating more electron-hole pairs, favoring the photocatalytic reaction. With these results, Cs 3 Bi 2 I 9 perovskite immobilized in the designed microreactor demonstrates having great potential as an effective CO 2 photocatalytic reduction system.&amp;amp;#xD;</description>

Cu2O shows great potential as a catalyst for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECO2RR). However, the mechanism behind the formation of different final products from Cu2O nanostructures remains a challenge. In this study, we combine theoretical and experimental approaches to demonstrate that the full-exposed Cu sites in Cu2O (1 0 0) microcubes contribute to superior C2H4 selectivity compared to other microstructures such as Cu2O (1 1 1), (1 1 0), and (3 1 1) facets. Density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations reveal that the stronger orbital splitting between Cu 3d and O 2p orbital of Cu2O (1 0 0) facet facilitates the formation of neighboring and low valence state Cu active site, thereby enhancing *CO adsorption and C2H4 formation. These DFT results are supported by the synthesis of four kinds of Cu2O microparticles (MPs) with different exposed facets, where cubic-Cu2O with the (1 0 0) facet exhibits the highest Faradaic efficiency (61.3 %). This study has significant implications for the structural design and mechanism analysis of innovative catalysts used in ECO2RR.</description>

Several technologies are currently being applied in the maritime industry to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. An example is the implementation of an electric propulsion system with a battery charged using a renewable energy source. Meanwhile, it is important to analyze the energy demand and the quantity of emissions reduced in a vessel after installing this system. Therefore, this study focused on analyzing the energy demand and emissions produced on fishing boats, specifically the &#8220;Sandeq&#8221; fishing boats in West Sulawesi. The primary objective was to quantify the carbon dioxide emissions reduced after the conventional engine of the vessel was replaced with an electric propulsion system. Moreover, the energy demand of the boat was estimated by analyzing the daily speed, length of voyage, and engine capacity. The results showed that six batteries were required to provide the power needed for daily operation. Furthermore, the electric propulsion system was able to reduce CO2 emission by 7.94 tons annually per ship, leading to the reduction of fuel consumption and emission taxes to approximately 10 million Rupiah annually. These results were expected to encourage stakeholders to promote the transition from conventional diesel engines to electric-powered engines.</description>

Electrochemical CO2 reduction is considered a promising solution to mitigate the increasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Despite the promising potential of this process, highly active catalysts are needed to enable its efficient operation. Mixed metal oxide (MMO) materials can promote the formation of a dynamic interface between a metal and its oxidized form under applied potential, resulting in a unique interaction with the reaction intermediates. We synthesized a Pd&#8211;Mo MMO with controlled size and composition and examined the effect of these properties on CO2 electroreduction. Electron microscopy images confirmed the homogeneous distribution of the synthesized Pd7Mo1 on a ZIF-8-derived porous carbon support, with sizes of &#8764;1.3 and 4.5 nm for the samples annealed at 200 and 400 &#176;C, respectively. As shown by density functional theory calculations and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, adding 12.5 % Mo altered the electronic structure of Pd, enhancing CO desorption, and reducing the potential needed for CO production by up to &#8764;0.2 V, corresponding to a &#8764;40 % higher partial CO current density compared to pure Pd. This work demonstrates a facile MMO synthesis enabling particle size and composition control, which will facilitate the development of highly active MMO-derived nanoalloy materials for CO2 electroreduction.</description>

Abstract Despite the recent achievements in urea electrosynthesis from co-reduction of nitrogen wastes (such as NO 3 &#8722; ) and CO 2 , the product selectivity remains fairly mediocre due to the competing nature of the two parallel reduction reactions. Here we report a catalyst design that affords high selectivity to urea by sequentially reducing NO 3 &#8722; and CO 2 at a dynamic catalytic centre, which not only alleviates the competition issue but also facilitates C&#8722;N coupling. We exemplify this strategy on a nitrogen-doped carbon catalyst, where a spontaneous switch between NO 3 &#8722; and CO 2 reduction paths is enabled by reversible hydrogenation on the nitrogen functional groups. A high urea yield rate of 596.1 &#181;g mg &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 with a promising Faradaic efficiency of 62% is obtained. These findings, rationalized by in situ spectroscopic techniques and theoretical calculations, are rooted in the proton-involved dynamic catalyst evolution that mitigates overwhelming reduction of reactants and thereby minimizes the formation of side products.</description>

Carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an efficient pathway to convert CO2 into desirable products, yet its commercialization is greatly hindered by the huge energy cost due to CO2 loss and regeneration. Performing CO2RR under acidic conditions containing alkali cations can potentially address the issue, but still causes (bi)carbonate deposition at high current densities, compromising product Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) in present&#8208;day acid&#8208;fed membrane electrode assemblies. Herein, we present a strategy using a positively charged polyelectrolyte &#8212; poly(diallyldimethylammonium) immobilized on graphene oxide via electrostatic interactions to displace alkali cations. This enables a FE of ~85%, a carbon efficiency of ~93%, and an energy efficiency (EE) of ~35% for CO at 100 mA cm&#8208;2 on modified Ag catalysts in acid. In a pure&#8208;water&#8208;fed reactor, we obtained a 78% CO FE with a 30% EE at 100 mA cm&#8208;2 at 40oC . All the performance metrics are comparable to or even exceed those attained in the presence of alkali metal cations.</description>

Tailoring catalytic reaction pathways by using reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to tune the electron-hole separation channels in the active sites of noble metals for achieving ideal yield and selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction of hydrocarbon fuels remains a challenge. Herein, ternary catalyst of rGO-coated SnO2-supported noble metal Pd nanoparticles (Pd4/SnO2@rGO) has been prepared by coassembly between negatively charged graphene oxide and positively charged Pd nanoparticles. By coating with ultrathin rGO, the selectivity can be shifted from CO (44.69 % for Pd4/SnO2) toward CH4 as the prevalent species, in which the Pd nanoparticles acted as catalytic sites and electron capture sites. The rGO coating reduced the recombination of the photogenerated carriers as well as optimized the band gap and reduction potential of the catalyst. The in situ spectroscopic tests and density functional theory calculations revealed that CO2 adsorbed on Pd nanoparticles selectively formed dominant low-energy CHO* intermediates because of the generation of HCOOH* intermediates, thus providing a unique reaction pathway for the reduction of CO2 to CH4. Therefore, under sunlight irradiation, the CH4 selectivity of the catalyst is enhanced to 94.1 % with a production rate of up to 77.8 &#956;mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1. This work demonstrated the prospect to tune the electronic structure of Pd using rGO, which provided a strategy for enhancing the carbon dioxide reduction reaction and selectively obtaining CH4 products in photocatalytic systems.</description>

Abstract Single&#8208;atom catalysts possess great potential for applications in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reactions. Recently, the fast and low&#8208;cost preparation of highly efficient single&#8208;atom catalysts remains a challenge. Herein, a high&#8208;density current generated by pulsed discharge is employed for the formation of graphene aerogel anchored Cu single atom catalysts perfectly. The Cu atoms decomposed by Cu(NO 3 ) 2 &#8226;xH 2 O are fixed on graphene under the local transient high temperature and intense electromagnetic field. The activity and selectivity of formic acid are correlated with the coordinatively unsaturated Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 moieties, reaching an optimal Faradaic efficiency (93.7%) at &#8722;0.9 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). In situ characterizations reveal that the asymmetric Cu&#9472;N/O structure in a pinched state displays better catalytic activity in CO 2 RR. Density functional theory results indicate that the Cu&#9472;N 1 O 1 sites regulate the adsorption configuration of intermediates and lower the energy barrier for the hydrogenation of * OCHO species, thereby promoting CO 2 &#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion.</description>

The utilization of biochar is often heralded as a salient approach to curtailing emissions and sequestering carbon. Agricultural and forestry soils have demonstrated its efficaciousness in reducing carbon emissions; however, the urban greening industry has yet to be thoroughly researched in this regard. To address this lacuna, the present study undertook the application of biochar to the soil of an urban green roof, with the aim of ascertaining its potential to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. By studying the effects of applying BS-0%, BS-1%, BS-5%, and BS-10% biochar on green roof substrate, the study examined the carbon dioxide value over a period of 36 h encompassing both sunny and nocturnal environments. The results indicated that the addition of biochar to the soil was effective in reducing carbon emission, with all of the biochar additions demonstrating an aptitude for carbon dioxide fixation. Notably, the application of BS-1% biochar evinced a statistically significant reduction in the carbon dioxide value. Furthermore, the addition of biochar to the roof substrate was found to be crucial in controlling rainwater runoff and alleviating urban eutrophication, indirectly reducing carbon emissions. This study provides a practical and theoretical framework for the application of biochar to mitigate the urban heat island effect.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; Benefits from Superelevated CO2 While Adapting to Far-red Light Over Time</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.21273/hortsci17522-23</link>
      <description>Emily J. Kennebeck, Qingguo Meng, Hortscience. 59(2)] 2024.
Compared with the ambient Earth carbon dioxide concentration (&#8776;415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), the International Space Station has superelevated carbon dioxide (&#8776;2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), which can be a stressor to certain crops. Far-red light can drive plant photosynthesis and increase extension growth and biomass. However, the effects of far-red light under superelevated carbon dioxide are unclear. We grew hydroponic mustard ( Brassica carinata ) &#8216;Amara&#8217; seedlings in four growth chambers using a randomized complete block design with two carbon dioxide concentrations (415 and 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 ), two lighting treatments, and two blocks at temperature and relative humidity set points of 22 &#176;C and 40%, respectively. Each growth chamber had two lighting treatments at the same total photon flux density of 200 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 . Under the same blue and green light at 50 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 each, plants received either red light at 100 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 or red + far-red light at 50 &#956;mol&#8901;m &#8211;2 &#8901;s &#8211;1 each. At day 15 after planting, far-red light did not influence shoot fresh or dry mass at 415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide, but decreased both parameters by 22% to 23% at 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration increased shoot fresh and dry mass 27% to 49%, regardless of the lighting treatment. Far-red light decreased leaf area by 16% at 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide, but had no effect at 415 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 carbon dioxide. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration increased leaf area by 21% to 33%, regardless of far-red light. Regardless of the carbon dioxide concentration, far-red light promoted stem elongation and decreased chlorophyll concentrations by 39% to 42%. These responses indicate far-red light elicited a crop-specific shade avoidance response in mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217;, increasing extension growth but decreasing leaf area, thereby reducing light interception and biomass. In addition, carbon dioxide enrichment up to 2800 &#956;mol&#8901;mol &#8211;1 increased the biomass of mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; but decreased the biomass of other crops, indicating crop-specific tolerance to superelevated carbon dioxide. In conclusion, mustard &#8216;Amara&#8217; seedlings benefit from superelevated carbon dioxide, but exhibit growth reduction under far-red light under superelevated carbon dioxide.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Solar Water Heating: Comprehensive Review, Critical Analysis and Case Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.52843/cassyni.z0lx6v</link>
      <description>Amal Herez, No host. None(None)] 2023.
The increasing global demand for renewable energy sources underscores the significance of Solar Water Heating Systems (SWHS), emphasizing the need for thorough research and analysis in this domain. SWHS play a pivotal role in addressing energy efficiency and environmental sustainability, making it imperative to conduct in-depth studies on their utilization. Hence, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of SWHS. It starts by explaining the principles behind these systems, including their components and classification. Moreover, this review consolidates various studies that have been conducted on SWHS to highlight both their advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, a case study is conducted in which it takes into consideration important economic and environmental factors. In particular, it focuses on several scenarios present in Lebanon such as family homes, schools, restaurants hotels and gyms to estimate potential cost savings achieved through implementing SWHS as opposed to relying solely on electric heaters. Furthermore, this investigation also examines the corresponding payback period associated with adopting SWHS along with assessing the significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions possible if these systems were widely implemented. The findings of the study demonstrate that there is a direct correlation between the extent to which SWHS are utilized and both the payback period and reduction in CO2 emissions. It was observed that when SWHS are used more frequently, with a high percentage of time (Pr=0.9), significant advantages can be achieved. For instance, for different types of establishments such as family homes, schools, restaurants, hotels, and gyms, it was estimated that average payback periods would be 14.2 years, 4.6 years, 9.2 years, 4.4 years, and 5.3 years, respectively. These results indicate that adopting a greater dependency on SWHSs not only leads to quicker cost recovery but also significantly contributes towards reducing carbon dioxide emissions. The analysis reveals that the yearly decrease in carbon dioxide emissions per individual is 0.16 t within a household, 0.016 t per student in an educational institution, 0.04 t per customer within a dining establishment, 0.37 t for each occupied bed in a hotel accommodation, and 0.11 t per individual at a gym. This paper serves as guidelines to SWH community. Additionally, it adds a practical insights into economic and environmental issues relevant to both Lebanon and countries with similar climates.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Influence of tillage methods on carbon dioxide emissions in spring wheat crops</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/20248206006</link>
      <description>Evgeniy Demin, Stanislav Miller, Kirill Likhanov, BIO web of conferences. 82(None)] 2024.
The agriculture intensification is associated with an increase in anthropogenic load on arable soils. Tillage leads to disruption of the natural process of soil formation in connection with which the soil biota activity changes and the carbon cycle is disrupted. The purpose of the study is to establish the effects of the tillage method on the carbon dioxide emission in spring wheat crops. The emission of carbon dioxide during the growing season of spring wheat varies significantly depending on the soil processing method and temperature. At the beginning of spring wheat development, the daily emission of carbon dioxide during the dump and subsurface tillage method does not exceed 36.0 and 36.2 CO 2 kg/ha using zero technology provides a reduction in production CO 2 production to 27.8 kg/ha*day. With an increase in soil temperature by July 24, the daily emission increases on a dump and subsurface background to 105.5 and 106.0 CO 2 kg/ha*day, on a zero background to 95.4 CO 2 kg/ha*day. In the future, it decreases. The total carbon losses during the dump and subsurface tillage methods are 2829 and 2793 kg/ha, the use of zero tillage technology reduces carbon losses in grain agrocenosis by 18%.</description>

The effect of conventional fuels has been investigated for its sustainable effect on the progress of power generation, the industrial sector, agriculture, and other related needs. In daily routine, the diesel engine has been identified as an essential part of the power and energy sectors. Diesel engine exhaust emissions have negatively impacted living organisms' health. Biodiesel have been identified as a sustainable fuel source that can replace traditional petroleum-based diesel fuel. The present work is to investigate using pomegranate peels to extract the pomegranate peel oil by Soxhlet apparatus and then convert it into biodiesel with the help of the transesterification process. Further, three different blending ratio mixtures with the help of pomegranate peel biodiesel (PPBD) were made on a volume basis, named PPBD 0 (FD 100%), PPBD 10 (10% biodiesel + 90% FD), and PPBD 20 (20% biodiesel + 80% FD), to check their performance and emission analysis on a single cylinder, four-stroke diesel engine. In diesel engines, the study investigated the system's performance concerning brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC). The study analyzed various emissions, including carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NOx), using a gas analyzer. The study results indicate that PPBD 20 is the most effective blending mixture in performance and emission reduction, making this fuel a potential substitute for fossil diesel.</description>

The coal-based energy consumption structure has led to high coal consumption and carbon emissions in China's iron and steel industry, and the task of coal saving and carbon reduction in the steel industry is difficult and urgent. The economic viability of various coal-saving and emission-reduction technologies, the extent of their coal-saving and emission-reduction potential, and the guidance on the adoption of advanced technologies are crucial issues that need to be addressed in the Chinese steel industry. This article employs the Energy-Production (E-P) analysis method and the Conservation Supply Curve (CSC) model incorporating coal consumption ratio coefficients to systematically analyze coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the overall iron and steel industry and its sub-processes under different scenarios. It calculates the coal-saving emission reduction costs of 32 technologies, evaluates them comprehensively based on their coal-saving and emission-reduction potentials and cost-effectiveness, and categorizes them accordingly. According to the cost of coal saving and emission reduction as the demarcation point, a total of 19 technologies are cost-effective; according to the coal-saving emission reduction potential and cost division, 32 technologies are divided into 6 categories, among which 6 technologies such as sintering waste heat recovery technology can be used as key technologies for popularization and application. Seven technologies, such as efficient preheating technology of ladle, have high cost and low potential, which can be gradually eliminated or improved and upgraded. After the comprehensive promotion of the 32 technologies, the maximum coal saving potential is about 3.453 billion GJ, the CO2 emission reduction potential is 395 million tons, the total coal consumption of the steel industry can be reduced to about 13.904 billion GJ, and the carbon dioxide emissions can be reduced to 1.179 billion tons.</description>

In recent years, achieving a decarbonized society has necessitated reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Many countries set goals to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions during each of these periods. To achieve this goal, the introduction of carbon dioxide-free Electric Vehicles will be effective. In this paper, we propose an on-grid Park &amp; Ride parking station to charge EVs with PV and WG. We also showed that the dynamic pricing case with varying electricity prices is better than the constant electricity price case. Variable prices encourage the purchase of electricity during the hours when electricity price is low. Such price cases contribute the reduction of operating costs.</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] Reduced Carbon Dioxide by Overexpressing EPSPS Transgene in Arabidopsis and Rice: Implications in Carbon Neutrality through Genetically Engineered Plants</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/biology13010025</link>
      <description>Lulong Sun, Ning Li, Zhen Yuan, Ying Wang, Bao&#8208;Rong Lu, Biology. 13(1)] 2023.
With the increasing challenges of climate change caused by global warming, the effective reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) becomes an urgent environmental issue for the sustainable development of human society. Previous reports indicated increased biomass in genetically engineered (GE) Arabidopsis and rice overexpressing the 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) gene, suggesting the possibility of consuming more carbon by GE plants. However, whether overexpressing the EPSPS gene in GE plants consumes more CO2 remains a question. To address this question, we measured expression of the EPSPS gene, intercellular CO2 concentration, photosynthetic ratios, and gene expression (RNA-seq and RT-qPCR) in GE (overexpression) and non-GE (normal expression) Arabidopsis and rice plants. Results showed substantially increased EPSPS expression accompanied with CO2 consumption in the GE Arabidopsis and rice plants. Furthermore, overexpressing the EPSPS gene affected carbon-fixation related biological pathways. We also confirmed significant upregulation of four key carbon-fixation associated genes, in addition to increased photosynthetic ratios, in all GE plants. Our finding of significantly enhanced carbon fixation in GE plants overexpressing the EPSPS transgene provides a novel strategy to reduce global CO2 for carbon neutrality by genetic engineering of plant species, in addition to increased plant production by enhanced photosynthesis.</description>

The development of floating photovoltaic systems in Romania can help to the share of more than 30.7 % of the total energy produced from renewable energy sources set for the year 2030. Floating photovoltaic plants ensure the achievement of overall energy targets without affecting biodiversity and/or agricultural crops. This study evaluates the insolation and the possibility of installing this technology on Lake F&#259;c&#259;u, Romania, to benefit from the generation of electricity but also better water quality and reduction of carbon dioxide emissions $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$. The obtained results are promising as Floating photovoltaic plants covering around 0.22 % of the lake surface, provide 26.76 $M W h /$ year and the estimated reduction of CO &lt;inf xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt; emission is 7.52 $\mathbf{t C O}_{2 \mathrm{eq}} /$ year.</description>

Traditional cooling strategies for greenhouses commonly result in significant electricity consumption and a substantial release of carbon dioxide emissions. Considering the industrial fabrication process for the greenhouse covering film and the thermal management theory, we developed a composite greenhouse covering film that incorporates titanium dioxide into polyethylene to achieve near-infrared reflection. The film demonstrates an impressive near-infrared reflectance of 54.4% within the wavelength range of 780&#8211;2500 nm. A tunnel-type greenhouse demo comparative test results show that the composite film can effectively decrease the average temperature inside the greenhouse by 6.7 &#176;C in comparison to the pure polyethylene film. The reduction implies a significant annual saving in cooling electricity at the national level of 2151912.3 MW h, along with an annual CO2 emission reduction by 1250261.1 tons.</description>

Reaching net-zero emissions by the middle of this century requires the implementation of massive carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction strategies along with the reduction of other greenhouse gases on both global and country scales. Thus, carbon capture, storage, and utilization (CCSU) is a promising technology in combination with renewable energy transition. Currently, CO2 utilization has attracted much attention from the scientific community worldwide, since it can improve the economic viability of CCSU deployment by creating a market for the recovered CO2 stream. In this study, a brief assessment and comparison of potential CO2 utilization pathways in Uzbekistan, including CO2-to-chemical/fuel conversion, CO2 bio-fixation/mineralization, and the direct use of CO2, such as for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery (EHR), are conducted considering the CO2 stationary sources and site-specific conditions of the country. In addition, possible challenges and opportunities for large-scale CO2 utilization routes are also discussed. According to this assessment, there is great potential for the direct use of CO2 as a process-boosting agent for EHR in more than 22 major natural gas, crude oil, and coal reservoirs. Moreover, methanol and urea production processes can also create huge market demand for recovered CO2 as long as the conventional CO2 production processes are replaced by sustainable ones.</description>

Abstract Carbon dioxide conversion into valuable products using photocatalysis and electrocatalysis is an effective approach to mitigate global environmental issues and the energy shortages. Among the materials utilized for catalytic reduction of CO 2 , Cu-based materials are highly advantageous owing to their widespread availability, cost-effectiveness, and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, Cu-based materials demonstrate interesting abilities in the adsorption and activation of carbon dioxide, allowing the formation of C 2+ compounds through C&#8211;C coupling process. Herein, the basic principles of photocatalytic CO 2 reduction reactions (PCO 2 RR) and electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction reaction (ECO 2 RR) and the pathways for the generation C 2+ products are introduced. This review categorizes Cu-based materials into different groups including Cu metal, Cu oxides, Cu alloys, and Cu SACs, Cu heterojunctions based on their catalytic applications. The relationship between the Cu surfaces and their efficiency in both PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR is emphasized. Through a review of recent studies on PCO 2 RR and ECO 2 RR using Cu-based catalysts, the focus is on understanding the underlying reasons for the enhanced selectivity toward C 2+ products. Finally, the opportunities and challenges associated with Cu-based materials in the CO 2 catalytic reduction applications are presented, along with research directions that can guide for the design of highly active and selective Cu-based materials for CO 2 reduction processes in the future.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.20909/kopast.2023.29.3.181</link>
      <description>Kim Sy, CHAROENSRI KORAKOT, Shin Yj, Park Hj, Han-gug pojang hag-hoeji. 29(3)] 2023.
In this study, we conducted a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of two different products, considering reusable and single-use packaging for fresh food distribution. For reusable packaging, we utilized expanded polyethylene (EPE), while for comparison, a disposable box made of widely used expanded polystyrene (EPS) was selected. We comprehensively analyzed the environmental impacts of production, transportation, reprocessing (for reused boxes), and disposal across 18 impact categories. Upon analyzing the actual reuse of 300 rounds of fresh food, the cumulative global warming potential (GWP) values for the EPE box were found to be 280.21 kg carbon dioxide (CO2) eq, demonstrating a significant 75% reduction compared to those of the EPS box. Furthermore, it was observed that the GWP values for the EPE boxes became equivalent to those of the EPS boxes after 12 rounds of reuse. In conclusion, reusable packaging shows substantial potential to contribute to the reduction of environmental burdens, aligning well with global environmental requirements for sustainable food distribution and related industries.</description>

      <description>Volodymyr Filippov, Roza Sagitova, Lidiia Voloshchuk, Lisa Jack, Ekonom&#236;&#269;nij &#382;urnal Odes&#697;kogo pol&#236;tehn&#236;&#269;nogo un&#236;versitetu. 3(25)] 2023.
Reducing food losses and waste is of significant importance in a world where the number of people suffering from hunger is increasing, especially after 2014. Food waste leads to ecological issues, including carbon dioxide emissions that exacerbate global warming, and it can also result in social and economic problems. It is also crucial to consider force majeure circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Russian invasion, and the declaration of martial law in Ukraine. Studying and adapting the Ukrainian experience in managing food waste during force majeure situations can be beneficial for other countries in reducing and processing food losses and waste globally. This article is an interim outcome of the UUT17 project (Research Project No. 1877-01/17) "Evaluation of opportunities for prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse of FLW in Ukraine".</description>

      <title>[CO2RR] ASTM Method for Inclusion Analysis of Prepared Green Steel</title>

In the present situation, steel-making industries have turned their attention towards producing quality steel, through more feasible routes. One of the routes is the production of green steel, which is a kind of steel produced through a process which reduces the emission of carbon dioxide. Steel produced through traditional methods relies heavily on fossil fuel and coal, emitting large amounts of CO2, resulting in 6 &#8211; 7 % of global greenhouse gas emissions. Eventually, steel production using blast furnaces requires coking coal, which has limited reserves in India. An alternative approach to this is the utilization of DRI which consumes either non-coking coal or Hydrogen for its reduction, which significantly reduces carbon emission. To produce clean steel, it is necessary to undergo a complete assessment of the Non-Metallic Inclusions (NMI). Often, Types, sizes and distribution of Non-Metallic Inclusions play a major role in the steel properties. The present study has been performed to investigate the inclusion rating of steel produced from hydrogen-based DRI (HDRI) during steel making in an Induction Furnace (IF) and carbon-based DRI to understand the cleanness of steel as per ASTM E-45 standard. The kinetics of inclusion formation during steel making in induction furnaces has been studied using Classical Nucleation Theory. Thermodynamic modelling of different types of inclusion formation was carried out using the Fact Sage software package and it has been validated experimentally with the inclusion classifier of the SEM/EDS analyzer.</description>

With the rapid growth of the world population and the continuous shortage of resources and energy, the research on liquid metal catalyst has gradually come into view. In recent years, the development of liquid metal and its alloys as new catalysts has made a great leap forward. Liquid metals as flow catalysts offer new research and development opportunities. Applications of liquid metal systems include the catalytic controlled growth of graphene, the catalytic growth of 2D materials (MoO2, MoS2, SnOx, etc.), the catalytic reduction of CO2 to achieve carbon neutrality, the catalytic organic and inorganic reactions (including propane dehydrogenation, methane dehydrogenation, polyphenol self-polymerization, free radical polymerization, etc.), and the catalytic production of hydrogen. Liquid metal catalysts also include photocatalysts, electrocatalysts, bimetallic catalysts, LM/MO frame catalysts, and heterogeneous catalysts. The classification, application, and related catalytic mechanism of different liquid metal catalysts at home and abroad were reviewed in this chapter. Liquid metal catalysts could be used as revolutionary materials in the new century, and their application in the field of catalysis presents new challenges.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Intercalation of pyrazolone-based oxalamide metal complexes into Na-montmorillonite for catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.55730/1300-0527.3630</link>
      <description>Serhat Uzan, Ey&#252;p Ba&#351;aran, Turkish Journal of Chemistry. 47(6)] 2023.
The intercalation of pyrazolone-based oxalamide metal complexes into Na-montmorillonite (Na-MMT) for catalytic liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 was undertaken by a flexible ligand method using metal ions including Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II). First, the metal ions were exchanged with the sodium ions of Na-MMT, and then these metal ions were complexed with a new pyrazolone-based oxalamide ligand. The intercalated metal complexes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis. Phenol was successfully oxidized by heterogeneous catalysts based on Mn(II), Zn(II), and Sn(II) pyrazolone-based oxalamide complexes intercalated into Na-MMT. These heterogeneous catalysts catalyze the liquid-phase oxidation of phenol using H2O2 to catechol as the major product and hydroquinone and benzoquinone as the minor products. The Mn(II) and Zn(II) complexes intercalated into Na-MMT showed better activity than the Sn(II) complex intercalated into Na-MMT and the reaction without the catalyst. It has been shown that some metal ion complexes intercalated into Na-MMT are active catalysts for liquid-phase oxidation of phenol with hydrogen peroxide.</description>

Hydrocracking catalysis is a key route to plastic waste upgrading, but the acid site&#8208;driven C&#8208;C cleavage step is relatively sluggish in conventional bifunctional catalysts, dramatically effecting the overall efficiency. We demonstrate here a facile and efficient way to boost the reactivity of acid sites by introducing Ce promoters into Pt/HY catalysts, thus achieving a better metal&#8208;acid balance. Remarkably, 100 % of LDPE can be converted with 80.9 % selectivity of liquid fuels over the obtained Pt/5Ce&#8208;HY catalysts at 300 &#176;C in 2 h. For comparison, Pt/HY only gives 38.8% of LDPE conversion with 21.3% selectivity of liquid fuels. Through multiple experimental studies on the structure&#8208;performance relationship, the Ce species occupied in the supercage are identified as the actual active sites, which possess remarkably&#8208;improved adsorption capability towards short&#8208;chain intermediates.</description>

Exploring bi- and trimetallic catalysts in electrochemical CO2 reduction (EC CO2R) has been a focal point for discovering reduction products. This study investigates the distinct roles of metal elements in the CO2R using CuNiZn and CuZn electrodes. Bimetallic CuZn exhibits superior electrochemical activity, yielding substantial amounts of CO, CH4, C2H4, and various liquid products, including formate, ethanol, acetate, propanol, and isopropanol. The study on trimetallic CuNiZn suggests potential connections to Fischer&#8211;Tropsch (FT) synthesis, indicating their capability to produce long-chain hydrocarbons (CnH2n and CnH2n+2, n = 2&#8211;7) from CO2. EC CO reduction validated the FT process over the bi- and trimetallic catalysts. The discussion explores mechanisms for the formation of CO, CH4, and C&#8211;C coupled C2+ products, considering potential- and concentration-dependent Faradaic efficiencies (FEs). Recycling tests emphasize the influence of metal composition on FEs. Surface analyses reveal oxidation states and compositional changes, while the dissolution of metals during electrochemistry highlights dynamic surface characteristics. This work provides insights into the metal composition of bi- and trimetallic catalysts, surface states, and electrochemical conditions, advancing our understanding of these electrodes and their role in CO2 recycling through electrochemistry.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Nickel Carbide Nanoparticle Catalyst for Selective Hydrogenation of Nitriles to Primary Amines</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202303573</link>
      <description>Sho Yamaguchi, Daiki Kiyohira, Kohei Tada, Taiki Kawakami, Akira Miura, Takato Mitsudome, Tomoo Mizugaki, Chemistry - A European Journal. None(None)] 2024.
Despite its unique physicochemical properties, the catalytic application of nickel carbide (Ni3C) in organic synthesis is rare. In this study, we report well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C) as a highly active catalyst for the selective hydrogenation of nitriles to primary amines. The activity of the aluminum&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported nano&#8208;Ni3C (nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3) catalyst surpasses that of Ni nanoparticles. Various aromatic and aliphatic nitriles and dinitriles were successfully converted to the corresponding primary amines under mild conditions (1 bar H2 pressure). Furthermore, the nano&#8208;Ni3C/Al2O3 catalyst was reusable and applicable to gram&#8208;scale experiments. Density functional theory calculations suggest the formation of polar hydrogen species on the nano&#8208;Ni3C surface, which were attributed to the high activity of nano&#8208;Ni3C towards nitrile hydrogenation. This study demonstrates the utility of metal carbides as a new class of catalysts for liquid&#8208;phase organic reactions.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Ionic liquid dopant induced 3D hierarchical CuO nanostructures with doped heteroatoms and highly dispersed Ag for electrochemical upgrading of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.148580</link>

The electrocatalytic 5-hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction (HMFOR) has received increasing attention due to its carbon&#8211;neutral and value-added chemical properties, and the development of electrocatalyst with highly active and selective is crucial. Highly dispersing metal atoms throughout the catalyst can maximize the catalytic efficiency. Here, we synthesized a 3D hierarchical CuO nanostructure induced by ionic liquid with heteroatoms doping and Ag dispersing (Ag-CuO@IL), and this self-supported catalyst can reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at only 1.33 V vs RHE and achieved HMF conversion of 98.5 %, FDCA yield of 97.1 % and Faraday efficiency of 92.2 %. The excellent catalytic performance of Ag-CuO@IL for HMFOR is attributed to the doped heteroatoms derived from ILs to promote electron redistribution and the generated oxygen vacancies induced by IL anions to highly disperse Ag. Also, the catalyst was the nanosheet-assembled spherical clusters with 3D nanostructure, which exposed a large number of active sites. Density functional theory calculations showed that Ag-CuO@IL possessed moderate adsorption strengths of HMF and OH&#8211;, thus facilitating the desorption of the products in the reaction process. The design that induced by ionic liquid dopant not only provides an effective and green mean for HMFOR, but also has the large potential to guide the synthesis of other catalysts with improved performances in various applications.</description>

The direct conversion of CO2 and CH4 into value-added chemicals at room temperature and atmospheric pressure poses a significant challenge in the chemical field. Nonthermal plasma (NTP) exhibits unique properties, enabling the provision of energy up to 10 eV at room temperature. However, the active species in NTP are complex, making the control of liquid products difficult. To address this, Cu can be introduced into &#947;-Al2O3 through the solid ion exchange method, followed by secondary calcination to obtain a nonprecious metal catalyst (Cu/&#947;-Al2O3) characterized by high activity, high stability, and exclusive Cu2+ species. Combining 10% Cu/&#947;-Al2O3 with plasma resulted in CO2 and CH4 conversions of 34.7 and 30.2%, respectively, with a liquid product selectivity of 55%. The presence of abundant Cu2+ species led to alcohol products reaching 38.3%, with methanol being the main product (29.6%), surpassing the reported 20.5%.</description>

CO2 conversion to CO via the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction is a promising source of syngas for subsequent synthesis of liquid fuels and chemicals. Herein, we present the synthesis of catalysts containing Au supported on hydroxylated Na-modified ZrO2, with Au amounts ranging from 0.05 to 1 wt.%. Systematic investigations reveal the formation of cooperative Au/Na sites at the interface. These sites cooperate synergistically to activate CO2 and generate a high surface density of carboxylate-like species, which serve as highly active intermediates for CO formation. It was found that the RWGS reaction on the catalyst with low Au loading proceeds mainly via a carboxylate pathway, with bidentate formate acting as spectators. At higher Au loading, the bidentate formate pathway contributes somewhat to CO formation alongside the carboxylate pathway. Based on temporal analysis of products, we emphasize the significant roles of H2 spillover and the metal-support interface in the RWGS reaction.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] Construction of novel surfactant-modified metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 with enhanced piezocatalytic degradation of diclofenac sodium</title>

      <description>Nan Li, Mianmian Wu, Zenghui Guo, Qingfei Li, Guifang Sun, Wenjing Shen, Minghao Shi, Jiangquan Ma, Solid State Sciences. None(None)] 2024.
Piezoelectric materials can harvest mechanical energy and convert it into electrical energy, which have lately become highly effective catalysts to sustainable eliminate pollutants. Here, by adding different surfactants to metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U) materials, the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-S) modified by sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) and the metal-organic framework adenine-UiO-66 (AD-U-C) modified by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were prepared for the first time. With the antibiotic diclofenac sodium (DCF) as the target pollutant, the degradation efficiencies of AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) were 98 % and 78 % in 30 min, respectively. Specially, the reaction rate constant of AD-U-S (0.30) is 3.5 times that of AD-U-C (0.30). The performance improvement is due to the larger specific surface area, stronger ferroelectric properties, enhanced oxidation capability and higher charge transfer efficiency of AD-U-S (0.30) than that of AD-U-C (0.30). The capture experiments showed that &#8231;OH and h+ were the main active species on AD-U-S (0.30) and AD-U-C (0.30) during the removal of DCF. In addition, possible pathways for DCF piezodegradation were obtained by liquid-phase mass spectrometry and DFT calculations. This study is benefit to promote the development of piezocatalytic technology for wastewater treatment.</description>

      <title>[liquid-metal] A heterogeneously activated peroxymonosulfate with a Co and Cu codoped bimetallic metal-organic framework efficiently degrades tetracycline in water</title>

      <description>Qianyuan Mo, Haoyuan Zheng, Guishang Sheng, Molecular Catalysis. 553(None)] 2024.
In the study presented in this paper, a cobalt and copper codoped bimetallic metal-organic framework (CoCu&#8211;MOF) was synthesized by a solvothermal method. The CoCu&#8211;MOF was then utilized to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade the tetracycline (TC) present in water. When the concentration of organic pollutants was 20 mg/L, the degradation efficiency of TC by the Co1Cu1&#8211;MOF/PMS system reached 98.17 % within 30 min, which was better than that of the PMS and Cu-MOF/PMS systems alone. The effects of catalyst addition, PMS usage, initial pH, temperature, coexisting ions and initial TC concentration on the degradation of TC by Co1Cu1&#8211;MOF were investigated. The sulfate radical (SO4&#8226;&#8722;), hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH), superoxide radical (O2&#8226;&#8722;), and nonradical singlet oxygen (1O2) were identified as the primary reactive species through quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analyses. Moreover, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) analysis was used to determine the occurrence of an electron transfer-mediated nonradical pathway in the reaction system in addition to 1O2. The concentrations of the TC intermediates were determined using liquid chromatography&#8210;mass spectrometry (LC&#8210;MS), and potential degradation processes were proposed. This study showed that CoCu&#8211;MOF is a heterogeneous catalyst that activates PMS for efficient TC degradation.</description>

Olive mill wastewaters (OMW) consist of high organic contents and are harmful to aquatic and terrestrial biota. Heterogeneous photocatalysis is a technology that can be operated under mild conditions to remove pollutants in the liquid phase. In the present work, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4, hereafter referred to as GCN) is studied for the first time as a metal-free photocatalyst for OMW treatment. The integration with peroxidation (H2O2), Fenton (Fe2+/H2O2 at both acidic and natural pH), chlorination (HOCl/ClO&#8722;) or persulfate (PS) activation is also investigated. This catalyst potentiated the activation of these oxidants, and H2O2 was identified as the best option to achieve high removals of total phenolic content &#8211; TPh (87.5 &#177; 0.3 %), dissolved organic carbon &#8211; DOC (63.8 &#177; 0.4 %) and chemical oxygen demand &#8211; COD (87.7 &#177; 0.6 %), without need to add iron or adjust the pH. The stability and reusability of the GCN material in the H2O2-assisted photocatalytic treatment of OMW give rise to new possibilities for treating these waste waters.</description>

Abstract. Porous interpenetrated zirconium&#8211;organic frameworks (PIZOFs) are a class of Zr-based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) which are composed of long, rod-like dicarboxylate linkers and Zr6O4(OH)4(O2C)12 nodes. Long oligoethylene glycol or aliphatic side chains are covalently attached to the linker molecules in the cases of PIZOF-10 and PIZOF-11, respectively. These side chains are supposedly highly mobile, thus mimicking a solvent environment. It is anticipated that such MOFs could be used as a solid catalyst &#8211; the MOF &#8211; with pore systems showing properties similar to a liquid reaction medium. To quantify the side-chain mobility, here we have applied different 1D and 2D NMR solid-state spectroscopic techniques like cross-polarization (CP) and dipolar-coupling chemical-shift correlation (DIPSHIFT) studies. The rather high 1H-13C CP efficiency observed for the CH2 groups of the side chains indicates that the long side chains are unexpectedly immobile or at least that their motions are strongly anisotropic. More detailed information about the mobility of the side chains was then obtained from DIPSHIFT experiments. Analytical expressions for elaborate data analysis are derived. These expressions are used to correlate order parameters and to slow motional rates with signals in indirect spectral dimensions, thus enabling the quantification of order parameters for the CH2 groups. The ends of the chains are rather mobile, whereas the carbon atoms close to the linker are more spatially restricted in mobility.</description>

Abstract Organic peroxides (R&#63743;O&#63743;O&#63743;R&#8242;), solid or liquid with the bivalent &#63743;O&#63743;O&#63743; structure. Relatively unstable and highly reactive molecules due to the presence of an oxygen&#8211;oxygen linkage. The oxygen&#8211;oxygen bond may be cleaved to form highly reactive free radicals and react with many substances (e.g., metals, acids, and bases). ROORs are used in plastics, rubbers, and many industries as initiators, accelerators, promoters, catalysts, activators, and more. Major concerns with ROORs are associated with fires, explosions, and corrosiveness. Reactive oxygen species and free radicals may lead to DNA damage and mutagenesis. Recent work from government agents, academic research laboratories, and manufacturing organizations have focused on physical hazards classification and categorization; and producing best practice protocols for safe handling and storage, control of temperatures, self&#8208;accelerating decomposition temperatures, spills cleaning, disposal, and treatment of ROORs residues. These efforts allow compliance with countries and international regulations. Potential health hazards are associated with eye and skin contact, inhalation, and ingestion. Acute exposure may lead to irritation, allergic response, and potential damage to the eye and skin. As with any irritant or corrosive, dose is a critical consideration with respect to understanding the risk. Chronic exposures, mostly understood in animals but there are human data, can cause a myriad of effects. These may range from respiratory illnesses, to liver, kidney damage, and cancer. The manufacturer's SDS of individual chemical may provide toxicity information. This chapter summarizes chemical&#8208;specific toxicity information on 77 organic peroxide compounds grouped in eight physical hazard categories. NIOSH has fully validated the method for benzoyl peroxide. NTP has released a report on the toxic effects of t &#8208;butyl perbenzoate and it deserves to be considered. Exposure assessment methods when available were presented. Future research needs to focus on epidemiological and toxicological studies of ROORs.</description>

Abstract The electrochemical conversion of nitrate to ammonia is a way to eliminate nitrate pollutant in water. Cu-Co synergistic effect was found to produce excellent performance in ammonia generation. However, few studies have focused on this effect in high-entropy oxides. Here, we report the spin-related Cu-Co synergistic effect on electrochemical nitrate-to-ammonia conversion using high-entropy oxide Mg 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 Zn 0.2 O. In contrast, the Li-incorporated MgCoNiCuZnO exhibits inferior performance. By correlating the electronic structure, we found that the Co spin states are crucial for the Cu-Co synergistic effect for ammonia generation. The Cu-Co pair with a high spin Co in Mg 0.2 Co 0.2 Ni 0.2 Cu 0.2 Zn 0.2 O can facilitate ammonia generation, while a low spin Co in Li-incorporated MgCoNiCuZnO decreases the Cu-Co synergistic effect on ammonia generation. These findings offer important insights in employing the synergistic effect and spin states inside for selective catalysis. It also indicates the generality of the magnetic effect in ammonia synthesis between electrocatalysis and thermal catalysis.</description>

      <title>[high-entropy-oxides] General Synthesis of High-Entropy Oxide Nanofibers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.3c07506</link>
      <description>Mengyuan Zhang, Jian Ye, Ying Gao, Xiaolan Duan, Jiahua Zhao, Shuangshuang Zhang, Xingxu Lu, Kai Luo, Qiongqiong Wang, Qiang Niu, Pengfei Zhang, Sheng Dai, ACS Nano. None(None)] 2024.
The discovery of high-entropy oxides (HEOs) in 2015 has provided a family of potential solid catalysts, due to their tunable components, abundant defects or lattice distorts, excellent thermal stability (&#916;G&#8595; = &#916;H &#8211; T&#916;S&#8593;), and so on. When facing the heterogeneous catalysis by HEOs, the micrometer bulky morphology and low surface areas (e.g., &lt;10 m2 g&#8211;1) by traditional synthesis methods obstructed their way. In this work, an electrospinning method to fabricate HEO nanofibers with diameters of 50&#8211;100 nm was demonstrated. The key point lay in the formation of one-dimensional filamentous precursors, during which the uniform dispersion of five metal species with disordered configuration would help to crystallize into single-phase HEOs at lower temperatures: inverse spinel (Cr0.2Mn0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Fe0.2)3O4 (400 &#176;C), perovskite La(Mn0.2Cu0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Fe0.2)O3 (500 &#176;C), spinel Ni0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2Mn0.2Co0.2)Al2O4 (550 &#176;C), and cubic Ni0.2Mg0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2Co0.2O (750 &#176;C). As a proof-of-concept, (Ni3MoCoZn)Al12O24 nanofiber exhibited good activity (CH4 Conv. &gt; 96%, CO2 Conv. &gt; 99%, H2/CO &#8776; 0.98), long-time stability (&gt;100 h) for the dry reforming of methane (DRM) at 700 &#176;C without coke deposition, better than control samples (Ni3MoCoZn)Al12O24-Coprecipitation-700 (CH4 Conv. &lt; 3%, CO2 Conv. &lt; 7%). The reaction mechanism of DRM was studied by in situ infrared spectroscopy, CO2-TPD, and CO2/CH4-TPSR. This electrospinning method provides a synthetic route for HEO nanofibers for target applications.</description>
