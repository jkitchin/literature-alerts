      <title>Co&#8211;Mn Bimetallic Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Nanosheets for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>

                Developing an efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst is the footstone of many electrochemical energy conversion devices. Herein, a cobalt&#8211;manganese bimetallic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is developed as an efficient OER catalyst (denoted as Co 3 Mn 1 BDC). The Co 3 Mn 1 BDC nanosheets demonstrate advantages in specific surface area, pore size distribution comparing with monometallic Co BDC and Mn BDC. The performance investigations demonstrate that the doping of Mn in Co&#8208;based MOFs facilitates the electrochemical area, charge transfer efficiency, reaction kinetics, and turnover frequency. As a consequence, the Co 3 Mn 1 BDC exhibits a low overpotential of 289 mV at current of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and a favorable Tafel slope of 56.8 mV dec &#8722;1 on glassy carbon electrode, which is better than IrO 2 . When the catalyst is loaded on Ni foam, the overpotential and Tafel slope are further decreased to 231 mV and 50.8 mV dec &#8722;1 . Moreover, the Raman spectrum confirms that the Co 3 Mn 1 BDC can be transformed into active CoOOH, suggesting the bright prospect in electrocatalysis devices as &#8220;precatalyst&#8221;.</description>

                Efficient and robust electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for developing high-performance rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Here, we report a highly stable, efficient bifunctional OER/ORR electrocatalyst and demonstrate its integration and robust performance in an aqueous ZAB. The catalyst is based on dual iron/nickel sites which are atomically dispersed on porous nitrogen-doped carbon particles and wrapped in electrically conductive multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Comprehensive experimental analyses and complementary density functional theory (DFT)-level computations provide in-depth understanding of the physical and electronic structure of the catalyst. Electrocatalytic analyses show high performance as OER and ORR catalyst (OER/ORR voltage difference = 0.71 V (at j = 10 mA cm-2). Catalyst integration in a ZAB results in excellent performance metrics: open circuit voltage 1.44 V, specific capacity (782 mAh g-1 at j = 15 mA cm&#8722;2, peak power density 218 mW cm&#8722;2 at j = 260 mA cm&#8722;2) and long-term durability over 600 charge/discharge cycles. This work highlights how high-performance bifunctional OER/ORR catalysts based on atomically dispersed non-critical metals can be designed and deployed in advanced energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Atomically Dispersed Vanadium&#8208;Induced Ru&#8210;V Dual Active Sites Enable Exceptional Performance for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202413657</link>
      <description>Qing Qin, Zijian Li, Xuhao Zhao, Hongyan Zhao, Li Zhai, Min Gyu Kim, Jaephil Cho, Haeseong Jang, Shangguo Liu, Xien Liu, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401931638

                Regulating the catalytic reaction pathway to essentially break the activity/stability trade&#8208;off that limits RuO2 and thus achieves exceptional stability and activity for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is important yet challenging. Herein, we propose a novel strategy of incorporating atomically dispersed V species, including O&#8208;bridged V dimers and V single atoms, into RuO2 lattices to trigger direct O&#8208;O radical coupling to release O2 without the generation of *OOH intermediates. Vn&#8208;RuO2 showed high activity with a low overpotential of 227 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and outstanding stability during a 1050 h test in acidic electrolyte. Operando spectroscopic studies and theoretical calculations revealed that compared with the V single atom&#8208;doping case, the introduction of the V dimer into RuO2 further decreases the Ru&#8210;V atomic distance and weakens the adsorption strength of the *O intermediate to the active V site, which supports the more energetically favorable oxygen radical coupling mechanism (OCM). Furthermore, the highly asymmetric Ru&#8208;O&#8208;V local structure stabilizes the surface Ru active center by lowering the valence state and increasing the resistance against overoxidation, which result in outstanding stability. This study provides insight into ways of increasing the intrinsic catalytic activity and stability of RuO2 by atomically dispersed species modification.</description>

      <title>Ultrasonic-Induced Surface Disordering Promotes Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c10977</link>
      <description>Chunyao Liu, Changhua Wang, Sheng Wang, Dashuai Li, Dexin Jin, Bunsho Ohtani, Baoshun Liu, He Ma, Jinglun Du, Yichun Liu, Xintong Zhang, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401933572

                Surface disordering has been considered an effective strategy for tailoring the charge separation and surface chemistry of semiconductor photocatalysts. A simple but reliable method to create surface disordering is, therefore, urgently needed for the development of high-performance semiconductor photocatalysts and their practical applications. Herein, we report that the ultrasonic processing, which is commonly employed in the dispersion of photocatalysts, can induce the surface disordering of TiO2 and significantly promote its performance for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. A 40 min ultrasonic treatment of TiO2 (Degussa P25) enhances the photocatalytic hydrogen production by 42.7 times, achieving a hydrogen evolution rate of 1425.4 &#956;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 without any cocatalyst. Comprehensive structural, spectral, and electrochemical analyses reveal that the ultrasonic treatment induces the surface disordering of TiO2, and consequently reduces the density of deep electron traps, extends the separation of photogenerated charges, and facilitates the hydrogen evolution reaction relative to oxygen reduction. The ultrasonic treatment manifests a more pronounced effect on disordering the surface of anatase than rutile, agreeing well with the enhanced photocatalysis of anatase rather than rutile. This study demonstrates that ultrasonic-induced surface disordering could be an effective strategy for the activation of photocatalysts and might hold significant implications for the applications in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, small molecule activation, and biomass conversion.</description>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting is a crucial strategy for advancing hydrogen energy and addressing the global energy crisis. Despite its significance, the need for a straightforward and swift method to synthesize electrocatalysts with exceptional performance remains pressing. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach for the preparation of multimetal-based electrocatalysts in a continuous flow reactor, enabling the quick synthesis of a large number of products through a streamlined process. The resultant NiFe-LDH comprises nanoflakes with a high specific surface area and requires only 255.4 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 in 1 M KOH, surpassing samples fabricated by conventional hydrothermal methods. Our method can also be applied to craft a spectrum of other multimetal-based electrocatalysts, including CoFe-LDH, CoAl-LDH, NiMn-LDH, and NiCoFe-LDH. Additionally, the NiFe-LDH electrocatalyst is further applied to anodic methanol electrooxidation coupled with cathodic hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the simplicity and generality of our fabrication method render it applicable for the facile preparation of various multimetal-based electrocatalysts, offering a scalable solution to the quest for high-performance catalysts in advancing sustainable energy technologies.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Oxygen Redox: Does Oxygen Dimerization Occur without Oxidation in Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;?</title>

                In layered lithium transition metal oxide cathodes, high-voltage operation is accompanied by the formation of oxygen dimers, which are widely used as an indicator of oxygen-redox activity. However, understanding the role that oxygen dimerization plays in facilitating charge compensation is still needed. Li2NiO3 (a 3d8L2-containing compound, where L is a ligand hole) is studied as a model system, where oxygen dimerization is shown to occur without cathode oxidation. Electrochemical cycling results in a net reduction of the cathode, accompanied by structural transformations, despite spectroscopic features of oxygen dimers arising at the top-of-charge. Here, oxygen dimerization is shown to coexist alongside a structurally transformed and electronically reduced cathode structure, thus highlighting that O dimerization is independent of bulk redox processes. This makes it clear that a thermodynamically derived transformation toward a reduced phase remains the only variable capable of generating O&#8211;O dimers in Li2NiO3.</description>

                The development of non-noble metal electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) is advancing towards the use of multi-element materials. To reveal the complex correlations of multi-element OER electrocatalysts, we developed an iterative workflow combining high-throughput experiments and AI-generated content (AIGC) processes. An increased number of 909 (compared to 145 in previous literature) universal descriptors for inorganic materials science were constructed and used as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) input. A large number of statistical ensembles with each ANN individual ensemble having a reduced number of descriptors were integrated with a new Hierarchical Neural Network (HNN) algorithm. This algorithm addresses the longstanding challenge of balancing overwhelming descriptor numbers with insufficient datasets in traditional ANN approaches to materials science problems. As a result, the combination of AIGC and experimental validation significantly enhanced prediction accuracy, increase the R2 values from 0.7 to 0.98 for Tafel slopes.</description>

      <title>Fluid&#8208;Induced Piezoelectric Field Enhancing Photo&#8208;Assisted Zn&#8211;Air Batteries Based on a Fe@P(V&#8208;T) Microhelical Cathode</title>

                Photo-assisted Zn-air batteries can accelerate the kinetics of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER); however, challenges such as rapid charge carrier recombination and continuous electrolyte evaporation remain. Herein, for the first time, piezoelectric catalysis is introduced in a photo-assisted Zn-air battery to improve carrier separation capability and accelerate the ORR/OER kinetics of the photoelectric cathode. The designed microhelical catalyst exploits simple harmonic vibrations to regenerate the built-in electric field continuously. Specifically, in the presence of the low-frequency kinetic energy that occurs during water flow, the piezoelectric-photocoupling catalyst of poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene)@ferric oxide(Fe@P(V-T)) is periodically deformed, generating a constant reconfiguration of the built-in electric field that separates photogenerated electrons and holes continuously. Further, on exposure to microvibrations, the gap between the charge and discharge potentials of the Fe@P(V-T)-based photo-assisted Zn-air battery is reduced by 1.7 times compared to that without piezoelectric assistance, indicating that piezoelectric catalysis is highly effective for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. This study provides a thorough understanding of coupling piezoelectric polarization and photo-assisted strategy in the field of energy storage and opens a fresh perspective for the investigation of multi-field coupling-assisted Zn-air batteries.</description>

                Transition metal oxides, especially cobalt oxides and hydroxides, are of great interest as precious metal free electrode materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrochemical and photoelectrochemical water splitting. Here, we present detailed studies of the potential&#8208; and pH&#8208;dependent structure and structural stability of Co3O4 and CoOOH in neutral to alkaline electrolytes (pH 7 to 13), using operando surface X&#8208;ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy, and electro&#173;chemical measurements. The experiments cover the pre&#8208;OER and OER range and were performed on epitaxial Co3O4(111) and CoOOH(001) films electrodeposited on Au(111) single crystal electrodes. The CoOOH films were structurally perfectly stable under all experimental conditions, whereas Co3O4 films exhibit at all pH values reversible potential&#8208;dependent structural transformations of a sub&#8208;nanometer thick skin layer region at the oxide surface, as reported previously for pH 13 (F. Reikowski et al., ACS Catal. 2019, 9, 3811). The intrinsic OER activity at 1.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode decreases strongly with decreasing pH, indicating a reaction order of 0.2 with respect to [OH&#8208;]. While the Co3O4 spinel is stable at pH 13, intermittent exposure to electrolytes with pH&#8804;10 results in dissolution as well as gradual degradation of its OER activity in subsequent measurements at pH 13.</description>

                Abstract Developing new clean energy sources and equipment to replace fossil fuel usage is an urgent global priority. However, one such essential method, electrolytic water hydrogen production's characteristics of slow kinetics and high potential barrier of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) hinder the large-scale application of such an approach. While precious metal catalysts have shown excellent catalytic activity, their high cost limits their feasibility for large-scale implementation. As a result, the development of stable and low-cost oxygen evolution reaction catalysts is critical. Transition metal layered hydroxides (TM LDHs) have been widely studied as a promising candidate for water electrolysis catalysis for their unique two-dimensional layered structure, high specific surface area, great electron exchangeability, and densely distributed active sites. Here in this research, we have synthesized nickel cobalt phosphide LDH (P-NiCo-LDH) that maximizes the utilization of foam nickel as the conductive substrate while protecting the phosphated LDH. This work proposes a practical approach for developing LDH as an OER catalyst and contributes to the ongoing efforts to advance sustainable clean energy sources.</description>

                For the sustainable development of green and clean electrochemical energy technologies, the advancement of high-performance electrode materials is essential. Precious metal catalysts such as those based on Pt, Ir, and Ru show high catalytic performance, but their scarcity and high cost restrict their application in energy technologies. Hence nanocarbon-based bifunctional electrocatalysts have emerged as a promising class of materials that hold the key to addressing critical challenges in energy conversion and storage technologies. Nanocarbon materials, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and their derivatives, have shown remarkable electrical conductivity, high surface area, and exceptional chemical stability, making them ideal candidates for electrocatalysis. However, these nanocarbon materials as such are electroneutral and catalytically inactive. Heteroatom doping and functionalization change the electronic properties of the nanocarbons and permit multifunctional electrocatalytic activity. These modified nanocarbons can catalyze the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in electrochemical systems, making them applicable in fuel cells, water electrolyzers, metal&#8211;air batteries, etc. This dual functionality of the materials in energy devices enhances the overall efficiency of energy conversion devices. Applications of nanocarbon-based bifunctional electrocatalysts extend beyond energy storage and conversion, encompassing electrochemical sensors, environmental remediation, etc. The multifunctional nature of nanocarbon materials, coupled with their versatility, holds great promise for developing efficient, durable, and cost-effective electrochemical devices. This chapter provides an insight into the promising field of nanocarbon-based bifunctional electrocatalysts and underscores their significance in shaping a sustainable energy future.</description>

                Metal&#8211;air batteries (MABs) have been gaining attention as a promising solution for next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices since they have a higher theoretical energy density than metal ion batteries, making them ideal for applications such as electric vehicles and grid energy storage. These attributes are essential for achieving the ultimate objective of phasing out the world&#8217;s reliance on fossil fuels in the long term. However, efficient bifunctional oxygen evolution/reduction reaction (OER/ORR) catalysts are crucial for the further development of MABs. This chapter summarizes the exploration of materials such as metal oxides and conductive polymers that have been identified as promising candidates exhibiting strong catalytic activity and stability in MABs. These materials demonstrate adaptability to diverse environments, whether aqueous or non-aqueous electrolytes, employing various methods for energy storage. These advances are a crucial step towards realizing the potential of MABs, meeting the increasing demand for reliable, high-energy density batteries in emerging technologies. The study of bifunctional electrocatalysts for MABs has provided valuable insights into their performance across different electrolytes and battery types, including Zn, Li, Mg, Na, and Al systems. Bifunctional electrocatalysts play a pivotal role by significantly enhancing both ORR and OER, essential for processes governing the efficiency of MABs. The applicability of bifunctional electrocatalysts underscores their potential to drive advances in various MAB technologies, facilitating the development of more efficient, durable, and versatile energy storage solutions. Ongoing research on and enhancement of these catalysts could lead to more efficient and sustainable energy storage solutions, ushering in a new era in MAB technology.</description>

      <title>Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Unitized Regenerative Fuel Cells</title>

      <description>Tapan K. Gupta, Biswajit Mondal, Royal Society of Chemistry eBooks. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401960118

                During the transition from conventional energy sources to sustainable alternatives, the role of energy storage and conversion is pivotal. Unitized regenerative fuel cells (URFCs) have attracted significant attention as promising energy storage and conversion devices owing to their ability to operate in both fuel cell (FC) and electrolyser (EL) modes within a compact single cell. They possess several advantages, including high power density, high specific energy density, light-weight design, low-cost production, high efficiency, long lifespan, and near-zero environmental impact. The development of efficient and durable bifunctional electrocatalysts is essential for the practical implementation and outstanding performance of URFCs. In URFCs, oxygen holds greater significance than hydrogen because its electrochemical reactions at the interface between the electrolyte and the electrode tend to be slow and intricate, primarily due to the pronounced irreversibility of oxygen-related processes. This chapter begins with a brief introduction to various types of FCs, setting the context for the subsequent discussion on URFCs. It provides an overview of bifunctional electrocatalysts in URFCs, highlighting their role in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It also discusses bifunctional oxygen catalysts (BOCs) reported in the literature, along with a brief discussion of bifunctional hydrogen catalysts (BHCs). The chapter systematically summarizes the recent advances, challenges, and prospects related to bifunctional catalysts, which are critical for the performance of URFCs.</description>

                This chapter provides an introduction to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and discusses the fundamental aspects and their significance in different applications. Measurements of different electrochemical parameters needed for the measurement of the OER and ORR performance of a catalyst are considered. A novel class of advanced porous hybrid materials has emerged: metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with variable pore sizes and large surface areas characterized by various periodic patterns. Because of their immense porosity and mechanical and thermal durability, they are used in a wide variety of applications. However, the low electrical conductivity and poor stability of MOFs make their use in electrocatalysis difficult. The benefits of using MOF-derived materials as bifunctional electrocatalysts for OER and ORR are discussed.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts into Highly Efficient MOOH Nanoclusters during Alkaline Water Oxidation</title>

                M&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;type single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are highly efficient for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). And the isolated metal atoms are usually considered real active sites. However, the oxidative structural evolution of coordinated N during the OER will probably damage the structure of M&#8722;N&#8722;C, hence resulting in a completely different reaction mechanism. Here, we reveal the aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials during the alkaline OER. Taking Ni&#8722;N&#8722;C as an example, multiple characterizations show that the coordinated N on the surface of Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C is almost completely dissolved in the form of NO3&#8722;, accompanied by the generation of abundant O functional groups on the surface of the carbon support. Accordingly, the Ni&#8722;N bonds are broken. Through a dissolution&#8208;redeposition mechanism and further oxidation, the isolated Ni atoms are finally converted to NiOOH nanoclusters supported by carbon as the real active sites for the enhanced OER. Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C also have similar aggregation mechanism. Our findings provide unique insight into the structural evolution and activity origin of M&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;based catalysts under electrooxidative conditions.</description>

                M&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;type single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are highly efficient for the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). And the isolated metal atoms are usually considered real active sites. However, the oxidative structural evolution of coordinated N during the OER will probably damage the structure of M&#8722;N&#8722;C, hence resulting in a completely different reaction mechanism. Here, we reveal the aggregation of M&#8722;N&#8722;C materials during the alkaline OER. Taking Ni&#8722;N&#8722;C as an example, multiple characterizations show that the coordinated N on the surface of Ni&#8208;N&#8208;C is almost completely dissolved in the form of NO3&#8722;, accompanied by the generation of abundant O functional groups on the surface of the carbon support. Accordingly, the Ni&#8722;N bonds are broken. Through a dissolution&#8208;redeposition mechanism and further oxidation, the isolated Ni atoms are finally converted to NiOOH nanoclusters supported by carbon as the real active sites for the enhanced OER. Fe&#8722;N&#8722;C and Co&#8722;N&#8722;C also have similar aggregation mechanism. Our findings provide unique insight into the structural evolution and activity origin of M&#8722;N&#8722;C&#8208;based catalysts under electrooxidative conditions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution: Dual-Functional Electrocatalyst of Zinc Iron Layered Double Hydroxides and Nickel Cobalt Sulfides on Nickel Foam for Seawater Splitting</title>

                Hydrogen, derived from water splitting, holds promise as a sustainable energy carrier. However, replacing fossil fuels demands large volumes of pure water, a resource that is scarce in numerous regions globally. This study focuses on developing an efficient electrocatalyst for seawater splitting, aiming to conserve freshwater resources and overcome the challenges associated with direct utilization of seawater. Zinc iron layered double hydroxides combined with nickel cobalt sulfides on nickel foam (ZnFe LDH@NiCoS/NF) are produced to operate efficiently in alkaline seawater splitting, which involves the evolution reactions of hydrogen and oxygen. Through the utilization of an alkalinized electrolyte and suitable nickel foam substrates, the adverse effects of corrosion and chlorine oxidation reactions are effectively mitigated. The composite ZnFe LDH@NiCoS/NF exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic efficacy in alkaline seawater, needing remarkably minimal overpotentials of 246.3 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 284.8 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to attain the targeted current density. Additionally, the composite electrocatalyst exhibits decreased Tafel values of 74.6 mV dec&#8211;1 for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 81.5 mV dec&#8211;1 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), suggesting enhanced kinetics. This improved electrocatalytic performance is attributed to the increased surface area and decreased charge transfer resistance. Additionally, the catalytic electrode exhibits impressive long-term stability, maintaining efficiency for approximately 50 h at a constant current density for both the HER and the OER. This study emphasizes the innovative character of ZnFe LDH@NiCoS/NF as a crucial breakthrough in research on bifunctional electrocatalysts for the HER and the OER, presenting a hopeful direction for harnessing renewable energy from seawater.</description>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting is an intriguing technique for clean energy production, and engineering heterojunctions with an internal electric field (IEF) can significantly enhance the electrocatalytic performance. In this paper, Co3O4/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction nanotubes have been prepared via electrospinning and calcination and show stronger activity and stability than single-phase Co3O4 and Bi2MoO6 due to the so-called "1 + 1 &gt; 2" synergistic effect induced by IEF. In particular, 1.00Co3O4/Bi2MoO6 nanotube catalyst performed the overpotential toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with 197 mV and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with 332 mV at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2. Based on the enhancement of IEF verified by density functional theory calculation, the extended photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline (TC) showed an efficiency of 68.5% within 200 min under visible light irradiation. This work provides a facile "one stone, three birds' strategy to construct nanotube heterojunctions and develops the IEF mechanism from photocatalytic to electrocatalytic application.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Highly Active Ln&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;IrO&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; Catalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acid</title>

                Abstract An improved understanding of catalyst dynamics for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acid is critical for informing the development of highly efficient, stable, and cost&#8208;effective OER catalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis applications. Herein highly tunable, active, and dynamic Ir 5+ materials are studied, Ln 3 IrO 7 (Ln = Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu). Leveraging a combination of in situ and ex situ characterization, as well as an advanced mercury underpotential deposition technique for Ir surface site quantification, the dynamic nature of Ln 3 IrO 7 materials throughout electrochemical activation under OER conditions is characterized. The trends are elucidated between intrinsic OER activity, surface Ir site quantity, and metal site dissolution behavior as tuned by the Ln site's atomic number. A critical relationship is uncovered to show that maintenance of excellent OER activity throughout performance testing is correlated with a catalysts&#8217; ability to preserve a high degree of Ir enrichment, where heightened stability of Ir sites interestingly parallels reduced stability of Ln sites throughout testing. It is found that as the Ln site's atomic number is decreased, the materials&#8217; intrinsic OER performance improves, due to an increased thermodynamic driving force for Ln dissolution, which is hypothesized to enable the maintenance of highly active Ir&#8208;based surface motifs.</description>

                The metal active site-induced adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM) and the lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism (LOM) can significantly improve the performance of the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction, but the LOM is not easily triggered on the AEM. Herein, a unique mixture of transition metal Ti3C2Tx MXene and cobalt hydroxide is introduced. A sulfur-doped Ti3C2Tx MXene substrate with a clear composition and layered structure was formed on Ti3C2Tx MXene thin-layer nanosheets by the sulfur template method for the study of alkaline electrochemical oxygen evolution. Sufficient metal active sites, robust structures, good electrochemical kinetics, and increased catalytic activity are provided by the resulting nanohybrids. Significantly, the sulfur-doped MXene substrate has more abundant oxygen vacancies and better hydrophilicity; this interaction is more favorable for improving the electrochemical performance of the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The results of electrochemical tests support the hypothesis that the interfacial electron coupling of two different components and the doping of the oxygen vacancy may optimize the adsorption energy of H2O and *OH, leading to a small overpotential of 207 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2, and the material is stable for the OER. This has great potential for the development of electrocatalysts where both the AEM and the LOM work together and their applications in energy-related fields.</description>

                Chapter 7 explores the significant impact of polyoxometalates (POMs) on the dynamic field of water oxidation electrocatalysis, also known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). POMs exhibit fascinating redox properties, diverse compositions and structures and remarkable versatility, making them pivotal players in the advancement of efficient OER electrocatalysts and a key element in the shift towards green energy conversion. This chapter serves as a valuable resource, offering insights into the application of POMs in OER, ranging from mechanistic studies using water-soluble POM platforms to investigations focused on the electrochemical characterization of POM-based nanostructured materials. To facilitate understanding, Chapter 7 is intuitively divided into five main sections. The first section provides an introduction to the fundamental aspects of the OER process, including the description of standard performance indicators. The second section delves into research on pure POMs, exploring their roles in both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems and paying particular attention to mechanistic aspects. Moving forward, the third section examines the OER electrocatalytic behaviour of various POM-based nanocomposites. These composites involve the integration of diverse POM clusters with other materials, such as nanocarbons, metals, metal (hydro)oxides and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), in search of synergistic enhancements. In Section 7.4, we showcase highly promising OER electrocatalysts derived from POM-containing precursors. In these cases, the original POM structure is sacrificed to achieve improved dispersion of metals while still maintaining high catalytic activity. Lastly, the concluding remarks summarize the most significant findings and provide an overview of the most effective approaches for synthesizing efficient noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for water oxidation.</description>

                Abstract To meet the rising demand for green hydrogen, efficient alkaline water electrolysis demands highly active and low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We address this issue by focusing our work on optimizing the conditioning of promising Ni&#8208;(Fe)&#8208;based electrodes to improve their electrocatalytic performances. Systematic parameter variation for cyclic voltammetry conditioning revealed that a large potential window, low scan rate, and a high number of cycles result in improved activation. If the conditioning time is fixed, a high scan rate was found beneficial. A remarkable 47&#177;6 mV potential drop at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 was achieved for Ni 70 Fe 30 when conditioning between &#8722;0.35&#8211;1.6 V at 100 mV s &#8722;1 for just 30 min. We could demonstrate that this activation persisted over 100 h at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 , underscoring its enduring efficacy. We suggest that this activation effect results from the growth of a hydrous hydroxide layer, which is supported by energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Fe incorporation or dissolution played only a minor role in the differences in electrode activation, as demonstrated by variation of the Fe content in the electrolyte. Our work stresses the importance of conditioning in enhancing OER performance and explores how to improve the catalysts&#8242; effectiveness by tailoring oxides.</description>

                Abstract Bimetallic nickel&#8208;iron based oxides are regarded as one of the most promising catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this study, we show that the precursor metal salts can affect the OER activity of the resulting Ni/Fe oxide under the same hydrothermal synthesis conditions. Pure sulfate, pure nitrate and mixed sulfate/nitrate metal salts were used to fabricate NiFe based oxide materials and to study the importance of the precursor choice for the OER. The results show that the nature of the precursor used in the synthesis of the bimetallic nickel&#8208;iron materials can influence different multi&#8208;phase catalysts to form which effects the OER.</description>

                Abstract Herein, we report on (a) the application of cobalt(II) tellurium oxide (Co 3 TeO 6 ) as a photo&#8208;electrocatalyst, to enhance the photo&#8208;electrocatalytic (PEC) oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, compared to the electrocatalytic (EC) OER (in the absence of light), and (b) to store charge upon illumination and release charge upon the termination of illumination under OER potential bias conditions. These nanomaterials were synthesized employing the sol&#8208;gel method and calcined at temperatures ranging from 400 to 1100 &#176;C. They were physically characterized and tested for their capacity to (i) act as a catalyst towards the OER, under EC and PEC conditions, and (ii) to convert and store light&#8208;energy as chemical&#8208;energy. Under PEC conditions CTO&#8208;900, which predominantly consisted of Co 3 TeO 6 , exhibited a five&#8208;fold increase in activity compared to EC conditions as current density increased from 0.58 mA cm &#8722;2 (EC) to 3.10 mA cm &#8722;2 (PEC) at 1.8 V ( vs . RHE). Additionally, CTO&#8208;900 displayed the ability to not only store charge (upon illumination), but to also release this stored charge (after the termination of illumination), realising a current density of 2.07 mA cm &#8722;2 in the dark (under OER potential bias conditions). Photo&#8208;induced charge storage is due to the intercalation of potassium ions into Co 3 TeO 6 .</description>

      <title>Chromium Promotes Phase Transformation to Active Oxyhydroxide for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for renewable energy technologies like metal&#8211;air batteries and water splitting. However, it suffers from sluggish kinetics, necessitating a high-activity and stable catalyst. In this study, we used Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to demonstrate that Cr doping favors the phase transition of metal (Fe, Co, Ni) hydroxide to the active phase oxyhydroxide. We synthesized FeCoNiCr hydroxide using an aqueous sol&#8211;gel method, ensuring that the four elements Fe, Co, Ni, and Cr are uniformly distributed at the atomic level. As an OER catalyst, FeCoNiCr hydroxide exhibits a very low overpotential of 224 mV in alkaline media, which is 52 mV lower than that of FeCoNi hydroxide, placing it among the best nonprecious metal catalysts reported so far. Additionally, it demonstrates long-term catalytic stability of 150 h. An assembled Zn-Air battery with FeCoNiCr hydroxides was cycled stably for 160 h with a low discharge/charge voltage difference of 0.70 V. DFT calculations and microkinetic modeling demonstrated that Cr doping significantly optimized the adsorption energies of OER intermediates at the Ni and Co sites, thereby enhancing overall OER activity. Bader charge calculations further revealed that Ni and Co in the catalysts consistently maintained a +3 valence throughout the OER process, which is beneficial for OER catalysis.</description>

                This study presents the synthesis of a multicomponent metal oxide electrocatalyst that increases the activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We synthesized transition metal oxides (MnOx, FeOx, CoOx, and NiOx) with MoO3 heterostructures through a solid-state reaction approach at low cost. In comparison to the other compositions, CoOx garnered higher attention and demonstrated superior performance on account of its large surface area and varied crystal facets. The MnOx-MoO3, FeOx-MoO3, CoOx-MoO3, and NiOx-MoO3 compositions attained an overpotential of 390 mV, 350 mV, 310 mV, and 340 mV, respectively, at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline solution. The performance of OER was enhanced in CoOx-MoO3 at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, while FeOx-MoO3 exhibited a lower current density at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 than other metal oxides. The CoOx-MoO3 material exhibited a favorable crystal interface transition due to the presence of MoO3 oxide. For the first time, we report on the MoO3-to-(MnOx, FeOx, CoOx, and NiOx) interface crystal transition and the active surface area for OER catalytic activity in water-splitting processes. This investigation intends to develop an electrocatalyst that is capable of producing hydrogen with the use of heterostructure metal oxides.</description>

                Abstract Gas&#8208;evolving reactions (GERs) are important in many electrochemical energy conversion technologies and chemical industries. The operation of GERs at high current densities is critical for their industrial implementation but remains challenging as it poses stringent requirements on the electrodes in terms of reaction kinetics, mass transfer, and electron transport. Here the general and rational design of self&#8208;standing carbon electrodes with vertically aligned porous channels, appropriate pore size distribution, and high surface area as supports for loading a variety of catalytic species by facile electrodeposition are reported. These electrodes simultaneously possess high intrinsic activity, large numbers of active sites, and efficient transport highways for ions, gases, and electrons, resulting in significant performance improvements at high current densities in diverse GERs such as urea oxidation, hydrogen evolution, and oxygen evolution reactions, as well as overall urea/water electrolyzers. As an example, the carbon electrode decorated with Ni(OH) 2 demonstrates a record&#8208;high current density of 1000 mA cm &#8722;2 at 1.360 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, largely outperforming the conventional nickel foam&#8208;based counterpart and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrodes.</description>

      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202404239</link>

                Abstract Perovskite oxides are considered highly promising candidates for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts due to their low cost and adaptable electronic structure. However, modulating the electronic structure of catalysts without altering their nanomorphology is crucial for understanding the structure&#8208;property relationship. In this study, a simple plasma bombardment strategy is developed to optimize the catalytic activity of perovskite oxides. Experimental characterization of plasma&#8208;treated LaCo 0.9 Fe 0.1 O 3 (P&#8208;LCFO) reveals abundant oxygen vacancies, which expose numerous active sites. Additionally, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analyses indicate a low Co valence state in P&#8208;LCFO, likely due to the presence of these oxygen vacancies, which contributes to an optimized electronic structure that enhances OER performance. Consequently, P&#8208;LCFO exhibits significantly improved OER catalytic activity, with a low overpotential of 294 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , outperforming commercial RuO 2 . This work underscores the benefits of plasma engineering for studying structure&#8208;property relationships and developing highly active perovskite oxide catalysts for water splitting.</description>

                Developing cost-effective and sustainable green metal-based materials to substitute precious metal catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a promising but challenging task. In this study, we propose a facile and ecofriendly coprecipitation method combined with a following hydrothermal treatment to synthesize a kind of monodisperse CoAl&#8211;LDH catalyst. The obtained nanoflakes are well water-dispersible and show regular morphology with an average particle size of about 179 nm. More importantly, an ultrathin thickness of approximately 2.3 nm of the as-prepared nanoflakes was achieved by controlling the temperature and duration of hydrothermal treatment without any surface modification. The excellent particle dispersibility and ultrathin thickness of the products make these nanoflakes to expose more active sites than the previously reported Co-based micro- and nanosized powders, thus allowing their OER catalytic activity to be enhanced significantly. Based on these obtained CoAl&#8211;LDH nanoflakes, a kind of CoAl&#8211;LDH/NF nanocomposite material has also been successfully fabricated, which exhibits outstanding catalytic performance in OER with a super low overpotential of only 200 mV at a current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 and a small Tafel value of 49 mV/dec. Even at a much higher current density of 100 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2, the detected overpotential can still be as low as 270 mV. This study presents a straightforward strategy for preparing cost-effective and high-efficiency LDH nanomaterials that may be used in the future industry of water electrolysis.</description>

      <title>Individual Marcus-type kinetics controls singlet and triplet oxygen evolution from superoxide</title>

                Oxygen evolution from superoxide is a critical aspect of oxygen redox chemistry. However, the factors determining the formation of often harmful singlet oxygen are unclear. Here, we report that the release of triplet or singlet oxygen is governed by individual Marcus normal and inverted region behavior. Using a wide range of chemical oxidants, we found that as the driving force increases, the initially dominant evolution of triplet oxygen slows down, and singlet oxygen evolution becomes predominant with higher maximum kinetics. This behavior also applies to superoxide disproportionation, the oxidation of one superoxide by another, in both non-aqueous and aqueous systems, where Lewis and Br&#248;nsted acidity control driving forces. Our findings suggest ways to understand and control spin states and kinetics in oxygen redox chemistry.</description>

                Non-van der Waals two-dimensional materials containing exposed transition metal atoms are promising catalysts for green energy storage and conversion. For instance, hematene and ilmenene have been successfully applied as catalysts. Building on these reports, this work is the first investigation of recently synthesized magnetene towards the Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) and Oxygen Reduction Reaction (ORR). Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we unveil the mechanism, performance and ideal conditions for OER and ORR on magnetene. With overpotentials of &#951;OER = 0.50 V and &#951;ORR = 0.41 V, the material is not only a bifunctional catalyst, but also superior to state-of-the-art systems such as Pt and IrO2. Additionally, its catalytic properties can be further enhanced through engineering strategies such as point defects and in-plane compression. It reaches &#951;ORR = 0.28 V at a compressive strain of only 2%, while the presence of Ni boosts it to &#951;OER = 0.39 V and &#951;ORR = 0.31 V, comparable to many reported single-atom catalysts. Overall, this work demonstrates that magnetene is a promising bifunctional catalyst for applications such as regenerative fuel cells and metal-air batteries.</description>

                Photoelectrochemical (PEC) processes will play a crucial role in future clean energy systems, however severe charge recombination and sluggish charge transfer kinetics have hindered their practical adoption. Exploiting ferroelectric polarization-controlled charge dynamics promises an additional lever that can potentially enable the performance limits of traditional static photoelectrodes to be surpassed. Here we report one of the most notable ferroelectric polarization-induced photocurrent enhancements, using a heterostructure of the multiferroic bismuth ferrite (BFO) and the photoactive bismuth vanadate (BVO) in a neutral pH electrolyte. In contrast to previous works, we report enhancements for both poling directions, of 136% for down-poled BFO/BVO and of 70% for the up-poled BFO/BVO, at 1.23 VRHE in comparison to the unpoled, delivering a Faradaic efficiency of more than 95% for prolonged oxygen evolution reaction. Extensive PEC and surface analyses complemented by DFT calculations reveal the improvements are attributed to the modulation of gradients in BFO band energies, changes in band-bending and offsets at the interfaces. Given the scalability of the employed sol-gel synthesis method and the use of environmentally benign materials and PEC conditions, our findings pave the way for multifunctional materials as new-generation agile and dynamic catalyst and photoelectrode systems.</description>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) provides the protons for many electrocatalytic power-to-X processes, such as the production of green hydrogen from water or methanol from CO2. Iridium oxo-hydroxides (IOHs) are outstanding catalysts for this reaction because they strike a unique balance between activity and stability in acidic electrolytes. Within IOHs, this balance varies with atomic structure. While amorphous IOHs perform best, they are least stable. The opposite is true for their crystalline counterparts. These rules-of-thumb are used to reduce the loading of scarce IOH catalysts and retain performance. However, it is not fully understood how activity and stability are related on the atomic level, hampering rational design. Herein, we provide simple design-rules (Figure 12) derived from literature and various IOHs within this study. We chose crystalline IrOOH nanosheets as our lead material because they provide excellent catalyst utilization and a predictable structure. We found that nanosheets combine the chemical stability of crystalline IOHs with the activity amorphous IOHs. Their dense bonding network of pyramidal trivalent oxygens (&#956;3&#8710;&#8211;O) provides structural integrity, while allowing reversible reduction to an electronically gapped state that diminishes the destructive effect of reductive potentials. The reactivity originates from coordinative unsaturated edge sites with radical character, i.e. &#956;1&#8211;O oxyls. By comparing to other IOHs and literature, we generalized our findings and synthesized a set of simple rules that allow prediction of stability and reactivity of IOHs from atomistic models. We hope that these rules will inspire atomic design strategies for future OER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Ti/Zr-SnO2/PbO2-Nd Electrode for Efficient Electrocatalytic Degradation of Alizarine Yellow R</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2174/0115734137325822240819050628</link>
      <description>Jing Zhang, Yang Bi, Guoqiang Gao, Qingdong Miao, Weiguo Hu, Jingang Yu, Current Nanoscience. 20(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402145152

                Introduction: A novel attempt to degrade alizarine yellow R (AYR) by lead dioxide (PbO2)/ neodymium (Nd) coated Ti anode was investigated. Method: Ti/Zr-SnO2/PbO2-Nd electrode showed high oxygen evolution potential, high current density, and neutral conditions, which favored the degradation of AYR. The PbO2-Nd layer on Ti/Zr-SnO2 was further characterized by scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The electrochemical properties of Ti/Zr- SnO2/PbO2-Nd electrode were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry, AC impedance spectroscopy, and accelerated life test. Result: The relatively higher oxygen evolution overpotential (~1.80 V) of the developed electrode can effectively suppress the occurrence of surface side reactions and oxygen evolution. A relatively lower charge transfer resistance (Rct, 18.0 &#937;) of Ti/Zr-SnO2/PbO2-Nd electrode could be found. The Ti/Zr-SnO2/PbO2-Nd electrode exhibited an accelerated lifetime of 110 min under a very high current density of 10,000 A/m2. The doping of Nd could produce loosely-stacked sheet-like structures, thus, the number of active sites on the electrode surface increases. Conclusion: Moreover, an outstanding conductivity of Ti/Zr-SnO2/PbO2-Nd electrode was obtained, which favored the electron transfer and catalytic activity of the modified electrode. The Ti/Zr-SnO2/PbO2-Nd electrode exhibited improved electrochemical performances and higher oxygen evolution potential, and the highest oxygen evolution potential is 1.80 V. Under the current density of 30 mA/cm2, the electrocatalytic degradation of 92.3% could be achieved in 180 min. The electrochemical oxidation of AYR at the Ti/Zr-SnO2/PbO2-Nd electrode proved to be feasible and effective, indicating that it might be used for the elimination of AYR from wastewater. conclusion: The electrochemical oxidation of AYR at the Ti/Zr-SnO2/PbO2-Nd electrode proved to be feasible and effective, indicating that it might be used for the elimination of AYR from wastewater.</description>

                Ni2+ doped ZnSnO3 nanoparticles (NPs) were synthesized using Aloe vera mediated solution combustion method, followed by an investigation into their luminescence and oxygen evolution reaction properties. The Bragg reflections of ZnSnO3: Ni(1-9 mol%) NPs revealed a cubic structure, with the addition of the dopant inducing lattice strain and resulting in peak shifting towards higher angles. No impurity-related peaks were observed. The estimated crystallite size and optical band gap decrease (3.1 to 2.94 eV) with an increase in dopant concentration. The surface morphology consists of irregular-sized and shaped NPs with hallows. The EDAX spectra show the purity of the sample. Photoluminescence emission spectra were recorded at a 230 nm excitation wavelength, where intense blue emission observed at 482 nm was attributed to a direct transition between the conduction band edge and the valence band edge, corresponding to the direct recombination of free excitons. Another satellite peak observed at 525 nm can be attributed to oxygen deficiency. Moreover, the nanoparticles exhibited outstanding performance in oxygen evolution reaction studies, showing low over potentials between 300 and 318 mV, a minimal Tafel slope of range 63-72 mV dec-1, and stable electrochemical behavior over 12 hours at a current density of 23 mA/cm2. These results highlight their effectiveness as electrocatalysts.</description>

                The growing need for clean and renewable energy sources, driven by a shortage of fossil fuels and serious environmental concerns, has made finding catalysts for energy conversion applications a significant challenge. The key reactions essential for converting and producing green energy include the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). Recently, the novel and rapid expansion of coordination materials, such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), porous coordination polymers (PCPs), and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have led to the creation of remarkable properties, allowing the development of heterostructures for various applications in different fields. Enhancing clean energy production efficiency is considered the essential promise of coordination materials, with their controlled structures, effective functionalizations, large surface areas, and high porosity. In this chapter, we summarize the brief overview of multifunctional coordination materials and their applications for green energy production.</description>

                A reasonable porous transport layer (PTL) is crucial to decreasing the mass-transfer loss in proton-exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). In this study, it was experimentally demonstrated that the gradient porosity PTL is beneficial in improving the performance of electrolyzers. The research comprehensively investigates the impact of gradient porosity PTL structures on the performance of the PEMWE, considering mass transfer and interfacial contact. It offers insights into the two-phase (oxygen-water) flow transport mechanisms within the PTLs using a 2D numerical model based on the actual PTL geometry. At the microscopic level, it analyzes how the interfacial contact impacts proton and electron transport mechanisms, affecting not only the contact resistance but also the number of effective catalytic sites for the oxygen evolution reaction. Experimental results demonstrate that the cis-gradient porosity PTL leads to a performance enhancement of 9.3% at 2.2 A/cm</description>

                Sc2CO2 MXene has potential applications in energy storage and optoelectronics due to its superior structure and excellent properties. The electronic properties, quantum capacitance, and photocatalytic activity of Cr-doped Sc2CO2 under strain are studied by the density functional theory. Cr doping makes the system produce magnetism. The spin-down states of Sc2CO2&#8211;Cr under strain are direct semiconductors, while their spin-up states are indirect semiconductors. Sc2CO2&#8211;Cr under +5, &#8722;5, &#8722;3, and &#8722;2% strains in an aqueous system are suitable for cathode material. A large voltage drastically modulates the type of electrode materials. Sc2CO2&#8211;Cr under strains from 0 to +2% can perform the oxygen evolution reaction at an alkaline environment, while the Sc2CO2&#8211;Cr system under strain is a good for CO2 photocatalysis at pH 0 and 7.</description>

      <title>Soluble Lead Redox Flow Batteries: Status and Challenges</title>

                Abstract Soluble lead redox flow battery (SLRFB) is an emergent energy storage technology appropriate for integrating solar and wind energy into the primary grid. It is an allied technology of conventional lead&#8208;acid batteries. This appraisal compares lead&#8208;acid batteries and SLRFB apropos their general characteristics. SLRFBs can overcome the inadequate cycle&#8208;life of Lead&#8208;Acid batteries as the electrodes of SLRFB do not participate in the reaction, which helps extending its durability. However, SLRFB has challenges of dendrite formation, oxygen evolution reaction, passivation of PbO 2 and shunt current. These problems need to be resolved before SLRFBs can be projected for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. In this technical update, we have reviewed the recent studies pertinent to dendrite formation, mechanism of the lead electrode, and reversibility of the PbO 2 electrode in the state&#8208;of&#8208;art of SLRFB along with progress in advances while developing a 12 V &#8211; 250 Wh 8&#8208;cell SLRFB stack.</description>

                Abstract The glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) is a potential alternative to water oxidation because of its relatively low thermodynamic potential and the high availability of glucose. Herein, a FeCoO/N&#8208;doped C electrode derived from metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials is applied, which is synthesized in several steps through the controlled deposition of Fe&#8211;Co oxide nanocatalysts onto Co &#8211;N&#8208;doped C nanofibers on a Ni foam substrate and demonstrate exceptional electrocatalytic activity for both the GOR and overall water splitting. Here, a bifunctional electrocatalyst derived from MOF, FeCoO/N&#8208;doped C is reported, for glucose oxidation reaction (GOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The MOF&#8208;derived FeCoO/N&#8208;doped C (+/&#8208;) as a bifunctional electrocatalyst exhibits a cell voltage of 1.4 V for the GOR&amp;HER, to reach a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , which is 280 mV lower than that for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)&amp;HER (1.68 V).

                This study explores the functionality of &#945;-Bi2Mo3O12 (BMO) as an electrocatalyst for water splitting and its suitability for supercapacitor applications. BMO was synthesized by the solvothermal method and characterized in pre-calcination [BMO (BC)], post-calcination [BMO (AC)], and base-etched forms [BMO (BE)]. Structural analysis confirmed the formation of &#945;-Bi2Mo3O12 with well-defined crystallographic planes. Electrochemical analysis revealed that BMO (AC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and BMO (BC) exhibited the lowest overpotential for oxygen evolution reactions (OER), indicating its superior electrocatalytic activity. The Tafel slope and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results confirmed the superior kinetics and charge transfer properties of BMO material. Furthermore, BMO samples demonstrated excellent stability during prolonged chronoamperometry (CA) testing for 12 h. For supercapacitor performances, the BMO (BE) exhibits a superior specific capacitance value of 398 F/g at 2.0 A/g. Thus, the BMO material delivers prominent electrocatalytic activity as well as supercapacitor performance. Overall, this study demonstrates the potentiality of &#945;-Bi2Mo3O12 in different forms as a dual-functional material for efficient energy storage and conversion.</description>

                Nickel&#8211;iron (oxy)hydroxide (NiFeOxHy) stands as a cutting-edge nonprecious electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of nickel and iron as anode materials in pure water-fed electrolyzers poses a significant durability challenge. In this study, an anion exchange ionomer coating was applied to NiFeOxHy to modify the local pH between a membrane and an electrode. This effectively extended the diffusion length of hydroxide anions toward the electrode, establishing an alkaline local pH environment. Stability tests with the ionomer coating showed reduced Ni dissolution. Moreover, locally resolved current density measurements were used to demonstrate a notably lower degradation rate during stability testing, revealing a 6-fold increase in stability with the ionomer on NiFeOxHy. In situ Raman spectroscopy in a neutral pH electrolyte confirmed inhibited Ni oxidation with the ionomer, mitigating Ni dissolution and enhancing stability of state-of-the-art NiFeOxHy catalysts in pure water-fed water electrolyzers.</description>

      <title>Bifunctional Electrocatalyst&#8211;Driven Hybrid Water Splitting for Energy&#8208;Saving Coproduction of Green H &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Valuable Chemicals</title>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting to generate green H 2 with renewable energy inputs is attractive to relieve the environmental contamination and energy dilemma. Restricted by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and single functionality of cathode/anode catalysts, conventional overall water splitting (OWS) suffers from high overpotentials and respective synthesis of monofunctional electrocatalysts, leading to high cost. Moreover, the generated O 2 bears low value and its possible mixing with H 2 poses safety issues. In response, hybrid water splitting (HWS) that integrates hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) with favorable oxidative upgrading reactions over bifunctional electrocatalysts can generate H 2 and value-added chemicals simultaneously with lower energy input and avoid the explosive H 2 /O 2 mixtures. Hence, this chapter focuses on the recent progress in bifunctional electrocatalyst&#8211;driven HWS for energy-saving coproduction of highly valuable chemicals and green H 2 . Firstly, the fundamentals of HER, OER, OWS, and HWS are introduced, followed by a discussion on the electrochemical reconstruction of bifunctional electrocatalysts during OWS and HWS. Next, the HWS based on bifunctional electrocatalysts is summarized, wherein the alternative oxidation reactions include upgrading of alcohol, aldehydes, amines, biomass, and plastic waste. Finally, a brief overview of current challenges and perspective for bifunctional electrocatalyst&#8211;driven HWS is discussed.</description>

                Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are considered a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and high capacity. However, they still suffer from the practical challenges of low discharge capacity and poor rate capability due to the hysteresis of Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics. Herein, based on the regulation of the lattice magnetic frustration, the Li/Ni intermixing defects as the primary origin of kinetic hysteresis are radically addressed via the doping of the nonmagnetic Si element. Meanwhile, by adopting gradient penetration doping, a robust Si&#8208;O surface structure with reversible lattice oxygen evolution and low lattice strain is constructed on Co&#8208;free Ni&#8208;rich cathodes to suppress the formation of surface dense barrier layer. With the remarkably enhanced Li&#8208;ion diffusion kinetics in atomic and electrode particle scales, the as&#8208;obtained cathodes (LiNixMn1&#8208;xSi0.01O2, 0.6 &#8804; x &#8804; 0.9) achieve superior performance in discharge capacity, rate capability, and durability. This work highlights the coupling effect of magnetic structure and interfacial chemicals on Li&#8208;ion transport properties, and the concept will inspire more researchers to conduct an intensive study.</description>

                Investigating the formation and transformation mechanisms of spiral-concave crystals holds significant potential for advancing innovative material design and comprehension. We examined the kinetics-controlled nucleation and growth mechanisms of Prussian Blue crystals with spiral concave structures, and constructed a detailed crystal growth phase diagram. The spiral-concave hexacyanoferrate (SC-HCF) crystals, characterized by high-density surface steps and a low stress-strain architecture, exhibit enhanced activity due to their facile interaction with reactants. Notably, the coordination environment of SC-HCF can be precisely modulated by the introduction of diverse metals. Utilizing X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and in-situ ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, we elucidated the formation mechanism of SC-HCF to Co-HCF facilitated by oriented adsorption-ion exchange (OA-IE) process. Both experimental data, and density functional theory confirm that Co-HCF possesses an optimized energy band structure, capable of adjusting the local electronic environment and enhancing the performance of the oxygen evolution reaction. This work not only elucidates the formation mechanism and coordination regulation for rich steps HCF, but also offers a novel perspective for constructing nanocrystals with intricate spiral-concave structures.</description>

                The efficiency of rechargeable metal-air batteries can be significantly improved by utilizing bifunctional oxygen catalysts that are capable of facilitating both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Continuous research efforts are crucial to develop highly efficient and cost-effective bifunctional catalysts for oxygen electrode reactions in various energy conversion and storage applications. This study introduces an innovative approach by harnessing the interfacial synergism of brominated phthalocyanine and carbon nanoparticles. Herein, a cost-effective metal&#8211;organic macrocycle featuring octa-bromo-substituted cobalt phthalocyanine, CoOBrPc, is synthesized and comprehensively characterized for its properties and evaluated performance in bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis. To boost its synergistic performance, an organic-hybrid composite is prepared by strategically incorporating Ketjen black (KB) nanoparticles. The optimized CoOBrPc + KB (4:1 respectively) organic hybrid exhibited outstanding bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity, bearing a minimal potential difference (&#916;E) of 518 mV at Eonset and 811 mV at Ej10 and E1/2, on a glassy carbon-rotating disc electrode in a 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at a 5 mV s&#8211;1 scan rate and a rotation speed of 1600 rpm. Additionally, the hybrid catalyst exhibited the same overpotential as the standard catalyst (IrO2) toward OER on a Ni foam substrate at j60. Furthermore, the designed hybrid catalyst exhibited a Tafel slope of 64.02 and 63.88 mV dec&#8211;1, j0 of 8.24 &#215; 10&#8211;6 and 1.33 &#215; 10&#8211;5 A cm&#8211;2, lower charge transfer resistance, and higher electrochemical active surface area for the OER and ORR, respectively. These promising results are attributed to a combination of factors, including enhanced mass transport at the interface, tailored electronic structure, and tuned surface morphology. Moreover, the composite's chemical stability and resistance to degradation ensure sustained catalytic activity in demanding operational conditions, positioning it as a compelling choice for energy conversion and storage applications such as electrolyzers and fuel cells, catalyzing both OER and ORR.</description>

                Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained tremendous notice for the application in alkaline water/seawater oxidation due to their tunable structures and abundant accessible metal sites. However, exploring cost-effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and excellent stability remains a great challenge. In this work, a promising strategy is proposed to regulate the crystalline structures and electronic properties of NiFe-metal-organic frameworks (NiFe-MOFs) by altering the organic ligands.

      <title>Selectivity Study of Direct Seawater Electrolyzer Anode Catalysts Using the Rotating Ring-Disc Electrode Method</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/1945-7111/ad7407</link>
      <description>Olivier Horner, David P. Wilkinson, El&#337;d Gyenge, Journal of The Electrochemical Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401898800

                Abstract Seawater electrolysis suffers from many issues that must be resolved before the technology can be scaled. The corrosive hypochlorite formation at the anode can damage the electrode and other electrolyzer components. Furthermore, hypochlorite is unstable and can decay, particularly when exposed to heat and metal ions, which could lead to erroneously high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) selectivity calculations in catalyst benchmarking experiments, resulting in poor catalyst and electrolyzer component selection. In this study, we used the rotating ring-disc electrode (RRDE) technique for the characterization of IrO2, NiO, Co3O4, RuO2, Pt/C, and PtRu electrocatalysts at near-neutral pH (8.4) in 0.5 M NaCl. The RRDE can overcome the challenge posed by thermocatalytic hypochlorite decay. IrO2 and PtRu were also studied over a range of chloride concentrations from 0.1 to 1 M. Our findings reveal that elevated temperatures (313 and 333 K) are conducive to higher OER selectivity, as the OER faradaic efficiency (FE) on IrO2 increased by 23% at 1.22 V vs SHE when the temperature was increased from 293 to 333 K. Increasing the chloride concentration from 0.1 to 1 M increased the OER current density by 40% and 200% on IrO2 and PtRu, respectively, indicating a synergistic relationship.</description>

      <title>Enhancing photoelectrochemical performance and stability of Ti-doped hematite photoanode via pentanuclear Co-based MOF modification</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2024.1454524</link>

                Modifying photoanodes with metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) cocatalysts has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the efficiency of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation. However, designing OER-active MOFs with both high photo- and electrochemical stability remains a challenge, limiting the advancement of this research. Herein, we present a facile method to fabricate a MOF-modified photoanode by directly loading a pentanuclear Co-based MOF (Co-MOF) onto the surface of a Ti-doped hematite photoanode (Ti:Fe 2 O 3 ). The resulting Co-MOF/Ti:Fe 2 O 3 modified photoanode exhibits an enhanced photocurrent density of 1.80 mA&#8729;cm &#8722;2 at 1.23 V, surpassing those of the Ti:Fe 2 O 3 (1.53 mA&#8729;cm &#8722;2 ) and bare Fe 2 O 3 (0.59 mA&#8729;cm &#8722;2 ) counterparts. Additionally, significant enhancements in charge injection and separation efficiencies, applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE), incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE), and donor density (N d ) were observed. Notably, a minimal photocurrent decay of only 5% over 10 h demonstrates the extraordinary stability of the Co-MOF/Ti:Fe 2 O 3 photoanode. This work highlights the efficacy of polynuclear Co-based MOFs as OER cocatalysts in designing efficient and stable photoanodes for PEC water splitting applications.</description>

                Abstract Electrolysis of seawater represents great potentials for sustainable hydrogen production. However, both competitive Cl &#8722; adsorption and catalysts corrosion caused by chlorine oxidation reaction (ClOR) are major challenges in seawater electrolysis. Inspired by the concept of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB), polyphosphate oxyanions (P 3 O 10 5&#8722; ) on Ni(OH) 2 surface is coordinated to obtain harder acid Ni sites, which could obtain 160 times stability enhancement compared to pure Ni(OH) 2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline seawater at 800 mA cm &#8722;2 . Also, the turnover frequency value on Ni(OH) 2 &#8208;P 3 O 10 5&#8722; is 50 times that on Ni(OH) 2 , implying higher intrinsic OER activity of Ni(OH) 2 &#8208;P 3 O 10 5&#8722; . Theoretical and experimental investigations show that P 3 O 10 5&#8722; could facilitate transition of Ni 3+ to harder acid Ni &gt;3+ , thus preferring adsorption of hard base OH &#8722; rather than soft base Cl &#8722; . This could enhance OER selectivity and inhibit undesirable ClOR. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the Cl &#8722; concentration near the electrode could be reduced by nearly half due to electrostatic repulsion of Cl &#8722; by surface P 3 O 10 5&#8722; oxyanions. When assembled into an electrolyzer for alkaline seawater splitting, it could operate at 2.2 V with large current up to 1.4 A for 240 h.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen production via alkaline seawater electrolysis using iron-doped nickel diselenide as an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mtchem.2024.102276</link>
      <description>Vipin Yadav, Naduvile Purayil Dileep, N. Nitin Nair, Pritish Kumar Behura, Manikoth M. Shaijumon, Materials Today Chemistry. 40(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402114391

                Green hydrogen production via seawater electrolysis is a promising pathway towards sustainable energy future. However, seawater splitting is hindered by the low stability and selectivity of electrocatalysts towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and faces severe electrode corrosion. Herein, we report the synthesis of highly active and durable Fe-doped nickel diselenide (Fe&#8211;NiSe2) nanoparticles supported on nickel foam as bifunctional electrocatalysts for efficient alkaline seawater electrolysis via an electrodeposition method followed by low-temperature annealing. The electrocatalytic properties of as-prepared Fe&#8211;NiSe2 toward HER and OER are investigated in different electrolytes. The optimized electrocatalyst (20-Fe-NiSe2) shows very low overpotential of 92 and 96 mV in alkaline (1.0 M KOH) and simulated seawater (1.0 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl) electrolytes, respectively, to reach the current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for HER. For the OER, 20-Fe-NiSe2 exhibits an overpotential of 333 and 311 mV in alkaline and simulated seawater electrolytes, respectively, to attain a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Further, full-cell studies are carried out with 20-Fe-NiSe2 as bifunctional electrocatalysts, which requires cell potential of 1.83 V and 1.81 V to deliver a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline and simulated seawater electrolytes, respectively. Additionally, the electrode shows tremendous potential for use in alkaline seawater electrolysis with stability over 100 h, at a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2, which is achieved at a low cell voltage of 1.87 V. The present work offers a simple, efficient, and cost-effective method for the development of heterogeneous Fe-doped nickel diselenide electrocatalysts for seawater electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Influence of Bi3+ Doping on Electrochemical Properties of Ti/Sb-SnO2/PbO2 Electrode for Zinc Electrowinning</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29174062</link>
      <description>Jia Wu, Xuanqi Kang, Shuang Xu, Zhen Wei, Shangyuan Xu, Kang Liu, Qing Feng, Bo Jia, Yun&#8208;Hai Wang, Molecules. 29(17)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4401909119

                Bi3+ doped Ti/Sb-SnO2/PbO2 electrode materials were fabricated by electrodeposition to improve their electrochemical performance in zinc electrowinning. The surface morphology, chemical composition, and hydrophilicity of the as-prepared electrodes were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and contact angle. An electrochemical measurement and an accelerated lifetime experiment were also conducted to investigate the electrocatalytic performance and stability of the electrodes. The results show that the Bi3+ modification electrode has an important effect on the coating morphology, the crystal structure, the surface hydrophilicity, the electrocatalytic activity, and the stability. The electrode prepared from the solution containing 2 mmol&#183;L&#8722;1 Bi(NO3)3 (marked as the Ti/Sb-SnO2/2Bi-PbO2 electrode) exhibits the best hydrophilicity performance (&#952; = 21.6&#176;) and the longest service life (1196 h). During the electrochemical characterization analysis, the Ti/Sb-SnO2/2Bi-PbO2 electrode showed the highest oxygen evolution activity, which can be attributed to it having the highest electroactive surface (qT* = 21.20 C&#183;cm&#8722;2) and the best charge-transfer efficiency. The DFT calculation demonstrated that the doping of Bi3+ leads to a decrease in the OER reaction barrier and an increase in the DOS of the electrode, which further enhances the catalytic activity and the conductivity of the electrode. Moreover, the simulated zinc electrowinning experiment demonstrated that the Ti/Sb-SnO2/2Bi-PbO2 electrode consumes less energy than other electrodes. Therefore, it is expected that the Bi3+ modified electrode will become a very promising electrode material for zinc electrowinning in the future.</description>

                Direct electrolysis of seawater to produce green hydrogen has attracted great attention. While the development of efficient and rapid manufacturing processes for high-performance electrodes, particularly for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), remains trail. Here, we introduce an innovative approach to fabricate high-performance NiFe-based OER electrodes using an ultrafast and eco-friendly bidirectional pulse current (BPC) method, which remarkably shortens the production time to only 20 s. Our BPC method alternates oxidation and reduction currents within a single period, promoting the in-situ formation of porous NiFe(oxy)hydroxide nanosheets through dissolution/deposition processes. Moreover, this methodology creatively utilizes the "Cl&#8722; induced effect", typically a hindrance in other electrochemical systems involving seawater or brine, to enhance the synthesis of electrodes from NaCl-based electrolyte devoid of additional Ni/Fe cations. The prepared NiFe-based electrode (NFF O-R 20 s) demonstrates remarkable OER catalytic activity, with optimal overpotentials (&#951;j) of 272, 308 and 367 mV at current densities (j) of 10, 100 and 1000 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Impressively, it maintains a low cell voltage of 1.59 V after enduring 1000 h of operation under the industrially current density of 300 mA cm&#8722;2, with a direct current energy consumption of 3.8 kWh Nm&#8722;3 H2 for overall alkaline seawater electrolysis. Our BPC preparation approach provides a promising path to construction high-catalytic activity, good-stability electrode, and low-energy consumption direct seawater electrolyzer.</description>

                Abstract We investigate the evolution of the Rieger periodicity at 152 &#8722; 156 days, the 27-day synodic rotation period as well as the 13.5 and 9-day harmonic periodicities in anomalous cosmic ray (ACR) oxygen (O) fluxes at the energy range between 8 - 25 MeV/n observed by the Advanced Composition Explorer(ACE) satellite during solar cycles 23 and 24. The ACR oxygen flux data is analysed using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and Morlet wavelet spectral analysis techniques. Daily mean oxygen fluxes during solar quiet times are used to identify how the ACR oxygens at different energies vary at the Rieger periodicity and at the solar rotation periodicities in each year. This is the first investigation of the periodicity evolution of ACR oxygen ions. Previous investigations have mostly concentrated on the spectral behaviour of GCR particles during various solar cycles of opposite polarities, in particular the 27-day and 13.5-day periodicities. Our analysis revealed a significant temporal and energy dependence in the spectral behaviour of ACR oxygen during both cycles, with the most prominent Rieger periodicity occurring during the late declining phase of these solar cycles.</description>

                Oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in stabilizing the ferroelectric phase in hafnium (Hf) oxide-based thin films and in shaping the evolution of their ferroelectric properties. In this study, we directly manipulated the oxygen vacancy concentration in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2&#8722;x (HZO) ferroelectric thin films in situ using oxygen plasma treatment. We scrutinized the variations in the ferroelectric properties of HZO films across different oxygen vacancy concentrations by integrating the findings from ferroelectric performance tests. Additionally, we elucidated the mechanism underlying the influence of oxygen vacancies on the coercive field and polarization properties of HZO ferroelectric films through the first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Finally, to study the impact of oxygen vacancies on the practical application of HZO ferroelectric synaptic devices, leveraging the plasticity of the ferroelectric polarization, we constructed a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. We simulated its recognition accuracy and convergence speed under different oxygen vacancy concentrations in the MNIST recognition task.</description>

                The pulse oximeter is a portable, bedside tool that allows for the measurement of oxygen saturation in a patient's red blood cells. The technology is based on oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin absorbing light at different wavelengths. The device calculates the ratio of oxygenated to deoxygenated hemoglobin in the blood, and an algorithm produces a percentage oxygen saturation value. Due to its portability and ease of use, it is a ubiquitous medical tool that is commonly used in medical practice. This paper reviews the history and evolution of this tool, and the scientific laws behind oximetry. It also introduces the importance of the pulse oximeter and its basic functions. In addition, the limitations of pulse oximetry are discussed, especially as they pertain to pigmented skin.</description>

                A bio-inspired FeFe hydrogenase model which catalyses hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic solutions is immobilized in polyaniline (PANI)-based nanotubes. A combination of analytical techniques reveals that this construct maintains both the molecular signatures of the bio-inspired complex and the material properties of PANI. The amine and imine-rich environment of the PANI chain amplifies the inherent HER activity of the bio-inspired complex, allowing electrocatalytic HER at neutral pH, with lower overpotentials and higher current densities compared to the bio-inspired complex alone. This construct retains the oxygen stability of the bio-inspired complex and remains stable through several hours of aerobic electrolysis, producing only 6.5% H2O2 from the competing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).</description>

                Nuclear performance analysis is of great significance for fuel design optimization and the safe operation of a reactor. Considering the design requirements of the China initiative Accelerator Driven System (CiADS) project, it is necessary to develop relevant fuel performance analysis tools to predict fuel performance evolution during service. The Fuel Element Analysis Tool for Undercritical Reactor Engineering (FEATURE) code, based on the advanced multiphysics coupling platform COMSOL software, is under development in this context, with a current focus on oxide fuel for fast reactors. This paper mainly conducts preliminary comparative verification of the oxygen redistribution, plutonium redistribution, and fission gas release modules of the FEATURE code through model examples, code-to-code evaluation, and experimental data. The results indicate that the FEATURE code exhibits good accuracy and reliability in simulating oxygen and plutonium redistribution, as well as fission gas release, making it suitable for integrated coupling calculations.</description>

                Relicts of subducted oceanic lithosphere provide key information for the tectonic reconstructions of convergent margins. In the Central Alps, such relicts occur as isolated mafic-ultramafic lenses within the migmatites of the southern Adula nappe and Cima-Lunga unit. Analysis of the major-, minor-, and accessory minerals of these ophiolitic relicts, combined with zircon and rutile U-Pb ages and zircon oxygen isotopes, allows the reconstruction of different stages of their complex evolution. The mafic-ultramafic suite in Valle di Moleno consists of chlorite-harzburgites associated with metarodingites and retrogressed eclogites. Relic omphacite and kyanite in retrogressed eclogites provide evidence for subduction-related metamorphism. Increasing X</description>

      <title>Minimal transcriptional regulation of horizontally transferred photosynthesis genes in phototrophic bacterium &lt;i&gt;Gemmatimonas phototrophica&lt;/i&gt;</title>

                ABSTRACT The first phototrophic member of the bacterial phylum Gemmatimonadota , Gemmatimonas phototrophica AP64 T , received all its photosynthesis genes via distant horizontal gene transfer from a purple bacterium. Here, we investigated how these acquired genes, which are tightly controlled by oxygen and light in the ancestor, are integrated into the regulatory system of its new host. G. phototrophica grew well under aerobic and semiaerobic conditions, with almost no difference in gene expression. Under aerobic conditions, the growth of G. phototrophica was optimal at 80 &#181;mol photon m &#8722;2 s &#8722;1 , while higher light intensities had an inhibitory effect. The transcriptome showed only a minimal response to the dark&#8211;light shift at optimal light intensity, while the exposure to a higher light intensity (200 &#181;mol photon m &#8722;2 s &#8722;1 ) induced already stronger but still transient changes in gene expression. Interestingly, a singlet oxygen defense was not activated under any conditions tested. Our results indicate that G. phototrophica possesses neither the oxygen-dependent repression of photosynthesis genes known from purple bacteria nor the light-dependent repression described in aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs. Instead, G. phototrophica has evolved as a low-light species preferring reduced oxygen concentrations. Under these conditions, the bacterium can safely employ its photoheterotrophic metabolism without the need for complex regulatory mechanisms. IMPORTANCE Horizontal gene transfer is one of the main mechanisms by which bacteria acquire new genes. However, it represents only the first step as the transferred genes have also to be functionally and regulatory integrated into the recipient&#8217;s cellular machinery. Gemmatimonas phototrophica , a member of bacterial phylum Gemmatimonadota, acquired its photosynthesis genes via distant horizontal gene transfer from a purple bacterium. Thus, it represents a unique natural experiment, in which the entire package of photosynthesis genes was transplanted into a distant host. We show that G. phototrophica lacks the regulation of photosynthesis gene expressions in response to oxygen concentration and light intensity that are common in purple bacteria. This restricts its growth to low-light habitats with reduced oxygen. Understanding the regulation of horizontally transferred genes is important not only for microbial evolution but also for synthetic biology and the engineering of novel organisms, as these rely on the successful integration of foreign genes.</description>

                Abstract. The Devonian is a warmer-than-present geological period spanning from 419 to 359 million years ago (Ma) characterized by multiple identified ocean anoxic/hypoxic events. Despite decades of extensive investigation, no consensus has been reached regarding the drivers of these anoxic events. While growing geological evidence has demonstrated a temporal correlation between astronomical forcing and anoxia during this period, underlying physical mechanisms remain unknown, hence questioning causality. Here, we perform multiple sensitivity experiments, using an Earth system model of intermediate complexity (cGENIE), to isolate the influences of specific Devonian climate and palaeogeography components on ocean oxygen levels, contributing to the better understanding of the intricate interplay of factors preconditioning the ocean to anoxia. We quantify the impact of continental configuration, ocean-atmosphere biogeochemistry (global mean oceanic PO4 concentration and atmospheric pO2), climatic forcing (pCO2) and astronomical forcing on background oceanic circulation and oxygenation during the Devonian. Our results indicate that continental configuration is crucial for Devonian ocean anoxia, significantly influencing ocean circulation and oxygen levels while consistently modulating the effects of other Devonian climate components such as oceanic PO4 concentration, atmospheric pO2 and pCO2, and orbital forcing. The evolution of continental configuration provides a plausible explanation for the increased frequency of ocean anoxic events identified during the Middle and Late Devonian periods, as it contributed to the expansion of oxygen-depleted zones. Our simulations also show that both the decreased atmospheric pO2 and increased oceanic PO2 concentration exacerbate ocean anoxia, consistent with established knowledge. The variation of pCO2 reveals a wide range of ocean dynamics patterns, including stable oscillations, multiple convection cells, multistability and hysteresis; all leading to significant variations of the ocean oxygen levels, therefore strongly impacting the preconditioning of the ocean to anoxia. Furthermore, multistability and important hysteresis (particularly slow ocean time response) offer different mechanisms to account for the prolonged duration of some ocean anoxic events. Finally, we found that astronomical forcing substantially impacts ocean anoxia by altering ocean circulation and oxygen solubility, with obliquity consistently emerging as the primary orbital parameter driving ocean oxygen variations.</description>

                Photocatalytic seawater splitting to produce clean hydrogen from nonpotable water using sunlight is a crucial endeavor. However, the scarcity of high-performance photocatalysts in the promising yet fledgling field presents a formidable challenge. Herein, we successfully synthesized a crystalline oxygen-modified carbon nitride (CCNO) polymeric semiconductor that served as an effective photocatalyst for seawater splitting. Comprehensive characterizations and theoretical calculations revealed that nitrogen vacancies and bridging oxygen in the CCNO lattice acted as potent Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs, creating an enhanced built-in electric field. This advancement significantly accelerated charge dynamics and bolstered resistance to ionic interference in seawater. Consequently, CCNO exhibited a robust photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of 29.51 mmol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 in natural seawater, with an impressive apparent quantum efficiency of 66.86% under 420 nm monochromatic light. Seawater splitting for H2 production reached 16.83 mmol g&#8211;1 under natural light irradiation for 3 h (9&#8211;12 o'clock), showcasing its great potential for practical applications. This work presents strategies for developing a metal-free photocatalyst and elucidates its reaction mechanism in the seawater splitting process, laying the foundation for scalable production of clean hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Oxidation Behavior of Lightweight Al0.2CrNbTiV High Entropy Alloy Coating Deposited by High-Speed Laser Cladding</title>

                High-temperature oxidation resistance is the major influence on the high-temperature service stability of refractory high entropy alloys. The oxidation behavior of lightweight Al0.2CrNbTiV refractory high entropy alloy coatings with different dilution ratios at 650 &#176;C and 800 &#176;C deposited by high-speed laser cladding was analyzed in this paper. The oxidation kinetic was analyzed, the oxidation resistance mechanism of the Al0.2CrNbTiV coating was clarified with the analysis of the formation and evolution of the oxidation layer, and the effect of the dilution rate on high-temperature performances was revealed. The results showed that the oxide layer was mainly composed of rutile oxides (Ti, Cr, Nb)O2 after isothermal oxidation at 650 &#176;C and 800 &#176;C for 50 h. The Al0.2CrNbTiV coating in low dilution exhibited better oxidation performance at 650 &#176;C, due to the dense oxide layer formed with the synergistic growth of fine AlVO3 particles and (Ti, Cr, Nb)O2, and higher percentage of Cr, Nb in (Ti, Cr, Nb)O2 strengthened the lattice distortion effect to inhibit the penetration of oxygen. The oxide layer formed at 800 &#176;C for the Al0.2CrNbTiV coating was relatively loose, but the oxidation performance of the coating in high dilution improved due to the precipitation of Cr2Nb-type Laves phases along grain boundaries, which inhibits the diffusion of oxygen.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Lattice Strain&#8208;Induced Vacancy Evolution Facilitating Highly Reversible Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Metal Anodes</title>

                Abstract Interfacial stress caused by semi&#8208;coherent and incoherent interfaces during zinc (Zn) plating and its effect on subsequent Zn deposition are important considerations for designing electrode/electrolyte interfaces to improve the electrochemical performance of Zn anodes. Although some studies have paid attention to this issue, the influence of lattice strain induced by Zn ion diffusion in the interface coating on Zn deposition is infrequently discussed. Herein, a tin&#8208;doped indium oxide (ITO) interfacial is constructed, and the evolution of interfacial lattice oxygen to vacancy oxygen (O V ) induced by lattice stress generated by Zn ion migration in the interface during Zn deposition is confirmed. The formed O V &#8208;rich ITO interface exhibits strong affinity and a low Zn ion diffusion barrier, accelerating the Zn ion transport kinetics. Meanwhile, the interface layer can appropriately capture anions in the electrolyte and improve the corrosion resistance of the electrode through the electrostatic repulsion effect. As a result, the O V &#8208;rich ITO&#8208;decorated Zn anode achieves stable Zn plating/stripping for more than 4500 h and delivers a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.6% after 1400 cycles at 1.0 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work provides a new horizon for the rational construction of the interface layer to achieve a highly reversible dendrite&#8208;free Zn metal anode.</description>

                Anthocyanins are well known as colorants of flowers, but many other invisible functions might have been more important during the evolution of complex biosynthesis networks in plants. The number of anthocyanin decorating enzymes, the subtle control of structural genes by numerous transcription factors, and routes of intracellular anthocyanin transport are reviewed here. Various ecological functions of anthocyanins hold the key to understanding evolutionary trajectories that lead to the success of these pigments. Proposed functions include carbon sinks that prevent excessive sugar levels, sun blockers protecting the photosynthesis apparatus, antioxidants scavenging reactive oxygen species, providing camouflage, and attraction of pollinators and seed dispersers. Anthocyanins clearly fulfill different functions in different plant organs. It is currently believed that protective functions in leaves gave rise to the biosynthesis network and that flower and fruit coloration evolved later.</description>

                None declared.Conflicts of interestMicroorganisms play vital roles in sulfur cycling through the oxidation of elemental sulfur and reduction of sulfite. These metabolisms are catalyzed by dissimilatory sulfite reductases (Dsr) functioning in either the reductive or reverse, oxidative direction. Dsr-mediated sulfite reduction is an ancient metabolism proposed to have fueled energy metabolism in some of Earth's earliest microorganisms, whereas sulfur oxidation is believed to have evolved later in association with the widespread availability of oxygen on Earth. Organisms are generally believed to carry out either the reductive or oxidative pathway, yet organisms from diverse phyla have been discovered with gene combinations that implicate them in both pathways. A comprehensive investigation into the metabolisms of these phyla regarding Dsr is currently lacking. Here, we selected one of these phyla, the metabolically versatile candidate phylum SAR324, to study the ecology and evolution of Dsr-mediated metabolism. We confirmed that diverse SAR324 encode genes associated with reductive Dsr, oxidative Dsr, or both. Comparative analyses with other Dsr-encoding bacterial and archaeal phyla revealed that organisms encoding both reductive and oxidative Dsr proteins are constrained to a few phyla. Further, DsrAB sequences from genomes belonging to these phyla are phylogenetically positioned at the interface between well-defined oxidative and reductive bacterial clades. The phylogenetic context and dsr gene content in these organisms points to an evolutionary transition event that ultimately gave way to oxidative Dsr-mediated metabolism. Together, this research suggests that SAR324 and other phyla with mixed dsr gene content are associated with the evolution and origins of Dsr-mediated sulfur oxidation.</description>

                This chapter is related to the application of polyoxometalates (POMs), POM-based composites and POM-derived electrocatalysts in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This reaction is a crucial part of the water splitting and, therefore, fundamental for hydrogen electroproduction. Given that POMs are made of transition-metal (TM) oxygen anion clusters with a d 0 electronic structure, they are the most promising class of hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts. Herein is presented a brief description of the HER process, while the important role of POMs electrocatalysts towards HER is discussed in detail. This chapter is organized in five sections, namely HER (Section 8.1), POMs electrocatalysts (Section 8.2), composites/hybrids materials (Section 8.3), POM-derived electrocatalysts (Section 8.4) and concluding remarks (Section 8.5). In the first section, the HER mechanism, state-of-the-art electrocatalysts and important electrochemical parameters to be evaluated are described. In the second section, the advantages of POMs as HER electrocatalysts are discussed, along with several examples of POMs application in HER. The third section is related to the most common POM-based composites used in HER electrocatalysis, namely POM/carbon, POM/metal organic frameworks (MOF), POM/metal and POM/polymers. The fourth section encompasses several classes of HER electrocatalysts obtained using POMs as metal precursor, including single-atom catalysts (SACs) and TM carbides, chalcogens, nitrates, phosphates and oxides. Lastly, the fifth section consists of an overview of the discussed electrocatalysts and the main results, also including some proposed future perspectives for POM-based/derived electrocatalysts towards HER.</description>

                To evaluate the safety and the potential antiviral treatment of inhaled enriched heparin in patients with COVID-19. The specific objectives were to investigate the anticoagulation profile, antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects, and respiratory evolution of inhaled enriched heparin. We conducted a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I/II clinical trial in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 receiving inhalation of enriched heparin or saline (placebo) every 4 h for 7 days. Among the 27 patients who completed the study, no changes in blood coagulation parameters were observed, indicating the safety of inhaled enriched heparin. The group receiving enriched heparin showed a significant reduction in the need for supplemental oxygen and improvement in respiratory parameters, such as the PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Inhalation of enriched heparin is shown to be safe and has also demonstrated potential therapeutic benefits for patients with COVID-19. These promising results justify the continuation of the study to the next phase, Phase II/III, to further evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of inhaled enriched heparin in the treatment of COVID-19-associated viral pneumonia.

                Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a group of highly active molecules produced by normal cellular metabolism and play a crucial role in the human body. In recent years, researchers have increasingly discovered that ROS plays a vital role in the progression of chronic inflammation and tumor metastasis. The inflammatory tumor microenvironment established by chronic inflammation can induce ROS production through inflammatory cells. ROS can then directly damage DNA or indirectly activate cellular signaling pathways to promote tumor metastasis and development, including breast cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, and so on. This review aims to elucidate the relationship between ROS, chronic inflammation, and tumor metastasis, explaining how chronic inflammation can induce tumor metastasis and how ROS can contribute to the evolution of chronic inflammation toward tumor metastasis. Interestingly, ROS can have a "double-edged sword" effect, promoting tumor metastasis in some cases and inhibiting it in others. This article also highlights the potential applications of ROS in inhibiting tumor metastasis and enhancing the precision of tumor-targeted therapy. Combining ROS with nanomaterials strategies may be a promising approach to enhance the efficacy of tumor treatment.</description>

      <title>Reaction&#8208;Driven Migration Dynamics of Nano&#8208;Metal Particles Unraveled by Quantitative Electron Microscopies</title>

                Abstract The stability of supported nano&#8208;metal catalysts holds significant importance in both scientific and economic practice, beyond the long pursuit of enhanced activity. While previous efforts have concentrated on augmenting the interaction between nano&#8208;metals and carriers, in the thermodynamic macro&#8208;perspective, to achieve optimized repression upon particle migration coalescence and Ostwald ripening, nevertheless, the microscale kinetics of migrating catalyst particles driven by the reaction remains unknown. In this work, the migration of nano&#8208;copper particles is investigated during hydrogen oxidation reaction by utilizing high spatiotemporal resolution of environmental transmission electron microscopy. It is shown that there exists a delicate correlation between the migration dynamics of nano&#8208;copper particles and the evolution of asymmetrically distributed Cu and Cu 2 O phases over the particle surface. It is found that the interplay of reduction and oxidation near the surface areas filled with Cu and Cu 2 O phases can facilitate the pressure gradient, which drives the migration of nano&#8208;particles. A driving force model is therefore established which is capable of qualitatively explaining the influences of reaction conditions such as temperature and hydrogen&#8208;to&#8208;oxygen ratio on the reaction&#8208;driven particle migration. This work adds a potential yet critical perspective to understanding particle migration and thus the nano&#8208;metal catalyst particle sintering in heterogeneous catalysis.</description>

      <title>(Re)mind the gap: A hiatus in star formation history unveiled by APOGEE DR17</title>

                Analysis of several spectroscopic surveys indicates the presence of a bimodality between the disc stars in the abundance ratio space of alpha /Fe versus Fe/H . The two stellar groups are commonly referred to as the high-alpha and low-alpha sequences. Some models capable of reproducing such a bimodality invoke the presence of a hiatus in the star formation history in our Galaxy, whereas other models explain the two sequences by means of stellar migration. Our aim is to show that the existence of the gap in the star formation rate between high-alpha and low-alpha is evident in the stars of APOGEE DR17, if one plots Fe/alpha versus alpha /H confirming previous suggestions. We then try to interpret the data by means of detailed chemical models. We compare the APOGEE DR17 red giant stars with the predictions of a detailed chemical evolution model based on the two-infall paradigm, taking into account also the possible accretion of dwarf satellites. The APOGEE DR17 abundance ratios Fe/alpha versus alpha /H exhibit a sharp increase in Fe/alpha at a nearly constant alpha /H (where alpha elements considered are Mg, Si, O) during the transition between the two disc phases. This observation strongly supports the hypothesis that a hiatus in star formation occurred during this evolutionary phase. Notably, the most pronounced growth in the Fe/alpha versus alpha /H relation is observed for oxygen, as this element is exclusively synthesised in core-collapse supernovae. The revised version of the two-infall chemical evolution model proposed in this study reproduces the APOGEE DR17 abundance ratios better than before. Particularly noteworthy is the model's ability to predict the hiatus in the star formation between the two infalls of gas, which form the thick and thin disc, respectively, and thus generate abundance ratios compatible with APOGEE DR17 data. We show that the signature of a hiatus in the star formation is imprinted in the APOGEE DR17 abundance ratios. A chemical model predicting a pause in the star formation of a duration of roughly 3.5 Gyr, and in which the high-alpha disc starts forming from pre-enriched gas by a previous encounter with a dwarf galaxy, could well explain the observations</description>

                Abstract The ratios of strong rest-frame optical emission lines are the dominant indicators of metallicities in high-redshift galaxies. Since typical strong-line-based metallicity indicators are calibrated on auroral lines at z = 0, their applicability for galaxies in the distant Universe is unclear. In this paper, we make use of mock emission-line data from cosmological simulations to investigate the calibration of rest-frame optical emission lines as metallicity indicators at high redshift. Our model, which couples the simba cosmological galaxy formation simulation with cloudy photoionization calculations, includes contributions from H ii regions, post-asymptotic-giant-branch stars, and diffuse ionized gas (DIG). We find mild redshift evolution in the 12 indicators that we study, which implies that the dominant physical properties that evolve in our simulations do have a discernible impact on the metallicity calibrations at high redshifts. When comparing our calibrations with high-redshift auroral line observations from the James Webb Space Telescope, we find a slight offset between our model results and the observations and find that a higher ionization parameter at high redshifts can be one of the possible explanations. We explore the physics that drives the shapes of strong-line metallicity relationships and propose calibrations for hitherto unexplored low-metallicity regimes. Finally, we study the contribution of DIG to total line fluxes. We find that the contribution of DIG increases with metallicity at z &#8764; 0 for singly ionized oxygen and sulfur lines and can be as high as 70%, making it crucial to include their contribution when modeling nebular emission.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary physiology</title>

                Evolution, a "process of heritable change in populations of organisms over multiple generations [&#8230;] through mechanisms including natural selection, sexual selection and genetic drift,"1 is the unifying framework that explains the diversity of life, guiding our understanding of biological processes, species interactions, and the development of new medical and biotechnological innovations. Evolutionary physiology is a multidisciplinary field that explores how organisms adapt their physiological functions to changing environmental conditions. Some authors attribute the development or emergence of evolutionary physiology as a subspecialty to the late 1980s2 as a field which integrates perspectives from genetics, ecology, and evolutionary biology to understand the origins, adaptability and maintenance of physiological diversity. Svante P&#228;&#228;bo, so-called "reader of the Neanderthal genome,"3 may be seen as a prime example who opened the door to ancient genomics. However, for a study to touch upon evolutionary physiology, it does not necessarily have to focus primarily on elucidating developments from eons past. In this paper, we take a closer look at recent publications, which aim to investigate the physiological adaptations and trade-offs that have arisen through natural selection, shedding light on evolutionary pathways, outcomes and perspectives. Recent developments, including climate change, are increasingly recognized as significant drivers of evolutionary processes in various species. These environmental changes create new selective pressures, leading to adaptations that can alter genetic diversity and influence species' survival and reproduction.4 The study by Sokolova et al. sheds light on the impact of environmental temperature changes on energy metabolism and thus on the mitochondrial function. Mitochondria, usually introduced in Bio 101 classes as cellular power plants, are in themselves almost bizarre examples of evolutionary development. Other entities within the mammalian organism are also of questionable descent, such as retrovirus-like Gag Protein Arc1, which&#8212;and we do not know why&#8212;bears a domain which resembles retroviral/retrotransposon -like proteins, which multimerize into a capsid that packages viral RNA.5 Most likely, once upon a time, mitochondria started out as &#945;-Proteobacteria. Until recently, the most common theory was an endosymbiont hypothesis, that is, an incorporation of bacterial cell compounds into eukaryotic cells. Recently, however, evidence has emerged which prompts the question of whether the mitochondrion really emerged after the eukaryotic cell, or if this organelle even originated simultaneously with the cell that contains it.6 Nevertheless, mitochondrial bacterial characteristics, such as cytosine-phosphate-guanosine, the membrane lipid cardiolipin, N-formylated peptides and circular double-stranded DNA may be responsible for inducing or perpetuating inflammatory processes following mitochondrial damage.7 Human energy metabolism is in itself a focus topic touching heavily on evolutionary physiology: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) expresses thermogenic uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), enabling humans to maintain their body temperatures during cold stress. As it has recently emerged how adults retain BAT, which may play a role in non-shivering thermogenesis, it has been hypothesized that BAT plasticity was a main factor in allowing human populations expansion into circumpolar regions.8 Recently developed UCP-1 deficient animal models allow a closer look at non-shivering thermogenesis9 and thermogenic adaptation to cold challenges,10 and further insights into the evolution of mammalian brown fat (non-shivering) thermogenesis,11 50 years after the identification and description of UCP-1.12 Also, mitochondria seem to be critically involved in the evolutionary adaptation of vertebrates to hypoxic or even anoxic environments,13 comprising mainly cardiorespiratory14, 15 as well as neuromuscular16 adaptations. During mammalian evolution, the utilization of oxygen and nutrients, as exemplified above, was adapted, as was the excretion of metabolic waste. In Book XXXI of his Natural History, Pliny the Elder mentioned a salt he named "hammoniacum," which is thought to have derived its name from its proximity to the Temple of Jupiter Amun (&#7948;&#956;&#956;&#969;&#957; Ammon in Greek), which was located in the Roman province of Cyrenaica.17 The precise nature of this salt remains uncertain; however, it is the etymological origin of the names for ammonia and ammonium compounds. Ammonia is one of the so-called "nitrogen wastes," which, together with urea, uric acid, and creatinine result from mammalian protein metabolism and must be excreted to avoid toxicity, processes whose evolutionary origins and development have recently been elucidated in intriguing detail.18-20 The evolution of another characterizing function of most higher organisms, circadian rhythm, is thought to have provided organisms with a survival advantage by synchronizing physiological processes and behavior with the predictable cycles of the environment, such as day and night. Circadian clocks are present in most light-sensitive organisms, from simple unicellular entities to humans, and probably provide an evolutionary advantage by enabling organisms to anticipate and proactively respond to challenges arising from their cyclic environment.21 Modern environments, mostly indirect results of human evolution, with artificial lighting and irregular schedules, can disrupt natural circadian rhythms, leading to potential behavioral and health-related consequences.22 In summary, these studies highlight the intricate relationship between physiology and evolution, demonstrating how organisms adapt to their environments through physiological modifications. By examining the evolutionary pathways and trade-offs that shape physiological traits, we gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying physiological diversity. These findings underscore the importance of considering evolutionary history in physiological studies and provide a foundation for future research in this dynamic and integrative field. As we continue to explore the complexities of evolutionary physiology, we can better appreciate the adaptive strategies that enable species to thrive in a constantly changing world.

      <title>Titanium Substitutions in Garnet at Magmatic, Granulite Facies, and High-Pressure Granulite Facies Conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2138/am-2024-9442</link>

                Abstract Crystallographically oriented lamellar to acicular rutile &#177; ilmenite inclusions in garnet may record important information about the pressure (P), temperature (T), and petrotectonic evolution of the lithosphere. However, reading this record requires a robust understanding of titanium (Ti) substitution mechanisms and solubility in garnet. To this end, we examine the Ti substitution systematics revealed by 87 garnet analyses from previously published experimental studies relevant for granulites, high-pressure granulites, and deep crustal magmatic rocks. The experimental P&#8211;T conditions range mostly between 850&#8211;1230 &#176;C and 1.0&#8211;2.7 GPa; four 3.2 GPa, 1075&#8211;1150 &#176;C ultrahigh-P, ultrahigh-T examples are also included. We find that normalizing garnet formulas based on 2 octahedral sites per 12 oxygens provides better Fe3+ estimates than the standard 8-total-cation scheme. The Fe3+ must be constrained as both it and Ti substitute on octahedral sites. Graphical analysis reveals that the main substitutions are Tschermak-Ti (VITi4+ + IVAl3+ &#8596; VIAl3+ + IVSi4+) and Andradite (VIAl3+ &#8596; VIFe3+), with lesser but nonetheless important contributions by Andradite-Ti (VITi4+ + IVAl3+ &#8596; VIFe3+ + IVSi4+) and alkali-Ti (VITi4+ + VIII(Na+,K+) &#8596; VIAl3+ + VIIIM2+). Here, VIIIM2+ denotes dodecahedrally coordinated divalent cations (Ca, Fe2+, Mg, Mn). We also posit a small role for Ti substitution coupled to dodecahedral vacancies. These inferences were independently tested using a Monte Carlo modeling procedure developed herein that quantitatively reproduces both the nature and extent of the observed substitutions. We also compared the experimental data with a representative suite of natural garnet analyses. In general, the natural garnets have far lower Ti and alkali (Na &#177; K) contents than the experimental ones. We attribute this to Ti and alkali loss in nature during exhumation and cooling by processes including diffusion and interface-coupled dissolution-reprecipitation. Some fraction of the lost Ti can be hosted by exsolved precipitates of crystallographically oriented rutile &#177; ilmenite. However, in many cases, these are absent and the Ti must have left the garnet structure entirely. The lost alkalis may be hosted by exsolved amphibole or mica precipitates, but these are relatively uncommon suggesting that alkalis are typically transferred from garnet to the matrix or to non-precipitate inclusions.</description>

      <title>Acute maternal hyperoxygenation protocol: consensus opinion from the Fetal Heart Society</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.29097</link>
      <description>Nitin Madan, Mary T. Donofrio, Anita Szwast, Anita J. Moon&#8208;Grady, Sarvar Patel, Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4402010025

                Acute maternal hyperoxygenation (MH) testing leverages two aspects of fetal cardiovascular physiology: (1) the normally high fetal pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR); and (2) changes in PVR upon exposure to increased fetal oxygen tension1, 2. Normal fetal PVR is high relative to systemic vascular resistance, directing the blood ejected from the right ventricle preferentially across the ductus arteriosus, with a small proportion entering the pulmonary arteries (PAs)1. By extension, a modest amount of left atrial filling is via the pulmonary veins. After delivery, mechanical expansion of the lungs and increased oxygen levels result in a rapid drop in PVR1. Exposure of the fetus to acute MH also results in a reduction in PVR, although less drastic than that at delivery. This response has been demonstrated in the second trimester3, but tends to become more prevalent2, albeit remaining variable4, 5, in the third trimester. Acute MH response is reflected by a decrease in pulsatility index (PI) in the PA branches (Figure 1) and increased pulmonary venous flow as assessed by Doppler on fetal echocardiography (FE). A 10&#8211;20% drop in branch PA-PI is considered reactive4, 6-8. The presence or absence of fetal pulmonary vascular reactivity is useful information. Some literature suggests that a lack of pulmonary vascular reactivity in certain cardiac and non-cardiac defects may signal poor postnatal outcome and, by extension, indicate the need for urgent postnatal resuscitation6, 7, 9, 10. However, given the reported variability in pulmonary vascular reactivity in the third trimester of healthy pregnancies4, 5, lack of reactivity in high-risk fetuses should be interpreted with caution. Fetuses demonstrating reactive PVR experience acute cardiovascular changes similar to postnatal circulatory shifts, including increased pulmonary blood flow, increased left-sided filling and changes in foramen ovale geometry. This simulation might predict unfavorable changes that may occur postnatally, such as profound hypoxemia due to persistent pulmonary hypertension, restrictive atrial septum in hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) or d-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA), and increased venous obstruction in total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC)7, 10, 11. In summary, acute MH testing may be useful to understand fetal pulmonary vascular reactivity and to mimic postnatal redistribution of blood flow and associated changes in anatomy and/or physiology. Despite the safety7, 12-14 and potential of acute MH testing in predicting postnatal hemodynamic instability with certain congenital cardiac and non-cardiac defects, this test remains underutilized secondary to the absence of a published standardized protocol and limited guidance regarding test interpretation. To address this, the Program Leaders Committee at the Fetal Heart Society formed a writing group of experts to develop an acute MH testing protocol. This document represents a consensus opinion on the various facets of acute MH testing, including timing, oxygen administration, FE assessments and test interpretation, providing a framework for fetal cardiac centers interested in implementing acute MH for clinical testing. For those fetal cardiac centers already conducting the test, it offers a standardized approach to foster collaborative learning and research in the field. Under the sponsorship of the Fetal Heart Society, a benchmarking survey aimed at elucidating current trends in fetal cardiology programs was carried out in 2023. Among the inquiries in this survey, one query focused on whether acute MH testing was performed at the surveyed site. Following the survey findings to this query, we assembled a panel of clinicians and researchers spanning the USA, Canada and the UK to collaborate on formulating a consensus protocol on acute MH testing. Group discussions were held to define objectives, and subsequently, the document underwent numerous iterations and was reviewed meticulously by all members until a consensus was achieved. Use of PWD is recommended Recovery phase after removing oxygen for 5 min (optional): FE assessment in the recovery phase is not required routinely; however, this is strongly recommended if concerning findings develop during acute MH, such as new or worsening tricuspid regurgitation, ductal constriction, new arrhythmia, foramen ovale closure and/or decrease in cardiac function. We present a consensus opinion on a standardized approach to conducting acute MH testing in both clinical and research settings. We provide indications, an image library and a basic guide to interpreting acute MH test results, based on the available literature. Additionally, we pinpoint knowledge gaps to serve as a compass for future research endeavors. This publication was developed with the support of the Fetal Heart Society sponsoring institutions. Without their contributions, the evolution of the Fetal Heart Society and this and ongoing research would not be possible.

                Abstract The Bansk&#225; &#352;tiavnica ore district is in the central zone of the largest stratovolcano in the Central Slovakia Neogene Volcanic Field, which is situated at the inner side of the Carpathian arc over the Hercynian basement with the Late Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary cover. Volcanic rocks of the High-K orogenic suite are of the Badenian through Pannonian age (16.5&#8211; 8.5 Ma). Their petrogenesis is closely related to subduction of flysch belt oceanic basement underneath the advancing Carpathian arc and to back-arc extension processes. The stratovolcano includes a large caldera 20 km in diameter and a late-stage resurgent horst in its centre, exposing a basement and extensive subvolcanic intrusive complex. The following stages have been recognized in the evolution of the stratovolcano: (1) formation of a large pyroxene/hornblende-pyroxene andesite stratovolcano; (2) denudation, emplacement of a diorite intrusion; (3) emplacement of a large granodiorite bell-jar pluton within the basement; (4) emplacement of granodiorite/quartz-diorite porphyry stocks and dyke clusters around the pluton; (5) caldera subsidence and its filling by biotite-hornblende andesite volcanics, emplacement of quartz-diorite porphyry sills and dykes at the subvolcanic level; (6) renewed activity of andesites from dispersed centres on slopes of the volcano; (7) uplift of a resurgent horst accompanied by rhyolite volcanics and granite porphyry dykes. The following types of ore deposits (mineralizations) have been identified in the Bansk&#225; &#352;tiavnica ore district: 1. Quartz-pyrophyllite-pyrite high-sulphidation system at &#352;obov, related to the diorite intrusion. 2. Magnetite skarn deposits and occurrences at contacts of the granodiorite pluton with Mesozoic carbonate rocks. Magnetite ores occur as lenses in the calcic skarns. 3. Stockwork/disseminated base metal deposit along an irregular network of fractures in apical parts of the granodiorite pluton and in remnants of basement rocks. Mineral paragenesis is simple, with leading sphalerite and galena and minor chalcopyrite and pyrite. In overlying andesites the mineralization is accompanied by metasomatic quartzites and argillites with pyrophyllite, kaolinite, illite and pyrite. 4. Porphyry /skarn copper deposits and occurrences related to granodiorite/quartz-diorite porphyry dyke clusters and stocks around the granodiorite intrusion. The mineralized zone is represented by accumulations of chalcopyrite in exo- and endo-skarns, usually of the magnesian type affected by serpentinization. Besides chalcopyrite, pyrhotite, minor bornite, chalcosite, tennantite and magnetite, rare molybdenite and gold are present. The alteration pattern around productive intrusions includes an external zone of propylitization, a zone of argillitic alteration (kaolinite &#8212; illite &#8212; pyrite) and an internal zone of phyllic alteration (quartz &#8212; sericite &#8212; pyrite). Biotitization is rare and limited to porphyry intrusions. 5. Intrusion related &#8220;mesothermal&#8221; gold deposit in an andesitic environment just above the granodiorite intrusion. Gold of high fineness with base metal mineralization is contained in brecciated and/or banded quartz veins of subhorizontal orientation, parallel to the surface of granodiorite pluton. At least the first phase of mineralization is older than quartz-diorite porphyry sills, which separate granodiorite and blocks of mineralized andesite. 6. Hot spring type advanced argillic systems in the caldera filling. Silicites and opalites accompanied by kaolinite, alunite and pyrite grade downward into smectite dominated argillites. 7. Vein type epithermal precious/base metal deposits and occurrences as a result of the long lasting interaction among structural evolution of the resurgent horst and evolving hydrothermal system, extensive intrusive complex and deep seated siliceous magma chamber serving as heat and magmatic fluid source. Three types of epithermal veins occur in a zonal arrangement: (a) base metal veins &#177; Au with transition to Cu &#177; Bi mineralization at depth in the east/central part of the horst, (b) Ag &#8212; Au veins with minor base metal mineralization and (c) Au &#8212; Ag veins located at marginal faults of the horst. Isotopic composition of oxygen and hydrogen in hydrothermal fluids indicate mixing of magmatic and meteoric component (with generally increasing proportion of meteoric component towards younger mineralization periods?). Veins are accompanied by zones of silicification, adularization and sericitization, indicating a low sulphidation environment. 8. Replacement base metal mineralization of a limited extent in the Mesozoic carbonate rocks next to sulphide rich epithermal base metal veins.</description>

ACS PublicationsCopyright &#169; Published 2024 by American Chemical SocietyWe are pleased to present our readers with a Collection on Interfaces and Interphases in Batteries with a selection of articles published in Langmuir between 2021 and the present. As highlighted in our previous collection on Electrode Interfaces, the Editorial Board of Langmuir observed that electrochemistry has gained importance within the interface science research community in recent years. As a community-driven journal with a strong commitment to meet the needs of our readership, in 2022, Langmuir expanded the journal scope to incorporate emerging topics that are currently or will become important waves of community interest. Topics such as interfacial electrochemistry, photocatalysis, nanomedicine, porous materials, and sustainability are becoming a predominant research interest, and our present and future Collections and Special Issues will match these needs and others that our readership may think necessary.Within the articles in this Collection, you will find a diverse set of materials and functionalities represented (Table 1). Often a high-performance standard (e.g., capacity or cyclability) or novelty achievement is the motivation of the authors. Among the materials that are highly represented within this collection of papers you will find graphene, other carbons, MXenes, polymer electrolytes, and various kinds of ion combinations, including frequently lithium-, sodium-ion, and lithium&#8211;sulfur and many oxides. The batteries can include different phases, air batteries, aerogels, and also all-solid state. Novel cathodes and anodes are introduced. Complex electrochemistry and simpler electron transfer processes that occur at interfaces may be found within. Some papers report evolutionary advances in storing energy, but some may even be revolutionary! Other papers present green chemistry advances in natural and recycled materials, e.g., from wastewater.Table 1.

(American Chemical Society) Silicon is considered one of the most promising next-generation anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. It has the advantages of high theor. specific capacity (4200 mAh&#183;g-1), which is 10 times larger than that of a com. graphite anode (372 mAh&#183;g-1). However, there are some problems such as the pulverization of the electrode and an unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer aroused by the huge bulk effect (&gt;300%) of Si during the repeated lithiation/delithiation process. A binder plays a vital role in the conventional lithium-ion batteries that can effectively relieve the bulk expansion stress of a silicon anode. In this work, the inorg. cross-linker sodium borate (SB) and the commonly used binder sodium alginate (SA) were condensed through an esterification reaction and the reaction product was marked as SA-SB. It is found that the mech. robustness and the peel strength of SA-SB are improved after crosslinking, which is conducive to maintaining the structural stability of the silicon anode in long cycle life. In consequence, the capacity retention of the silicon anode using the SA-SB binder (64.1%) is higher than that of SA (50.6%) after 100 cycles at 0.2 A&#183;g-1. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3MXivVCgsr%252FN&amp;md5=c9ce22cfb81b49d3c673a1f9ca5ac5026Zheng, H.; Hu, J.; Xie, W.; Sang, Y.; Xu, H.-S.

(American Chemical Society) Biomass as a carbon material source is the characteristic of green chem. Herein, a series of hierarchical P-doped cotton stalk carbon materials (HPCSCMs) were prepd. from cheap and abundant biowaste cotton stalk. These materials possess a surface area of 3463.14 m2 g-1 and hierarchical pores. As lithium-ion battery (LIB) anodes, the samples exhibit 1100 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles and hold 419 mAh g-1 at 1 A g-1 after 1000 cycles, with nearly 100% capacity retention. After HPCSCMs are loaded with sulfur (S/HPCSCMs), the samples (S/HPCSCMs-2) deliver a discharge capacity of 413 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 after 100 cycles as lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery cathodes.

(American Chemical Society) Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries are known as a prospective new generation of battery systems owing to their high energy d., low cost, non-toxicity, and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, several issues remain in the practical application of Li-S batteries, such as low sulfur usage, poor rate performance, and poor cycle stability. Ordered microporous carbon materials and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can effectively limit the diffusion of polysulfides (LiPSs) and have high elec. cond., resp. Here, inspired by the evapn. of zinc at high temps., we constructed CNTs interpenetrating ordered microporous carbon nanospheres (CNTs/OMC NSs) by high-temp. calcination and used them as a sulfur host material. With the benefit from the excellent elec. cond. of CNTs and OMC achieving uniform sulfur dispersion and effectively limiting LiPS dissoln., the S@CNTs/OMC NS cathodes show outstanding cycling stability (initial discharge capacity of 879 mAh g-1 at 0.5 C, maintained at 629 mAh g-1 for 500 cycles) and excellent rate performance (521 mAh g-1 at 5.0 C). Furthermore, the current study can serve as a significant ref. for the synthesis of CNTs that interpenetrate various materials. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3sXht1ehtbfM&amp;md5=65356ce3513f53e4cfbf3f9d525e9d3819Zhou, X.; Lv, P.; Li, M.; Xu, J.; Cheng, G.; Yuan, N.; Ding, J.

(American Chemical Society) For zinc-air batteries, it is of great importance to heighten the oxygen redn. reaction (ORR) activity of cathode electrocatalysts. Herein, we synthesized carbon nanoribbons doped with Fe, B, and N as high-activity ORR electrocatalysts by a templating method. Benefiting from the melamine fiber (MF) and B doping, the as-prepd. carbon nanoribbon has a high sp. surface area, and the improved turnover frequency of Fe sites increases the ORR activity. The as-synthesized Fe-B-N-C electrocatalyst shows an improved half-wave potential and limited c.d. compared to Fe-N-C, B-N-C, and N-C. Moreover, zinc-air batteries with the Fe-B-N-C electrocatalyst exhibit a higher specific capacity and better long-term durability compared to those with com. Pt/C. This work provides an effective strategy to synthesize noble-metal-free electrocatalysts for wide applications of zinc-air batteries. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3MXitlSjsb3E&amp;md5=d4b7075c320e35b0614c22dd52eee14228Cao, X.; Song, R.; Zhou, X.; Wang, X.; Dong, X.; Yuan, N.; Ding, J. 3D TM-N-C Electrocatalysts with Dense Active Sites for the Membraneless Direct Methanol Fuel Cell and Zn-Air Batteries.
