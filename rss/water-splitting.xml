      <title>Gas Evolution Kinetics in Overlithiated Positive Electrodes and its Impact on Electrode Design</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202400568</link>
      <description>Munsoo Song, Danwon Lee, Juwon Kim, Subin Choi, Ikcheon Na, Sungjae Seo, Sugeun Jo, Chiho Jo, Jongwoo Lim, Advanced science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394008615

                Abstract Increasing lithium contents within the lattice of positive electrode materials is projected in pursuit of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. However, it intensifies the release of lattice oxygen and subsequent gas evolution during operations. This poses significant challenges for managing internal pressure of batteries, particularly in terms of the management of gas evolution in composite electrodes&#8212;an area that remains largely unexplored. Conventional assumptions postulate that the total gas evolution is estimated by multiplying the total particle count by the quantities of gas products from an individual particle. Contrarily, this investigation on overlithiated materials&#8212;a system known to release the lattice oxygen&#8212;demonstrates that loading densities and inter&#8208;particle spacing in electrodes significantly govern gas evolution rates, leading to distinct extents of gas formation despite of an equivalent quantity of released lattice oxygen. Remarkably, this study discoveres that O 2 and CO 2 evolution rates are proportional to 1 O 2 concentration by the factor of second and first&#8208;order, respectively. This indicates an exceptionally greater change in the evolution rate of O 2 compared to CO 2 depending on local 1 O 2 concentration. These insights pave new routes for more sophisticated approaches to manage gas evolution within high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries.</description>

      <title>Ruthenium&#8208;based Binary Alloy with Oxide Nanosheath for Highly Efficient and Stable Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>

                Abstract Traditional noble metal oxide, such as RuO 2 , is considered a benchmark catalyst for acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, its practical application is limited due to sluggish activity and severe electrochemical corrosion. In this study, we synthesize Ru&#8208;Fe nanoparticles loading on carbon felt (RuFe@CF) via an ultrafast joule&#8208;heating method as an active and durable OER catalyst in acidic conditions. Remarkably low overpotentials of 188 and 269 mV are achieved at 10 and 100 mA cm &#8722;2 , respectively, with a robust stability up to 620 hours at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . When used as an anode in a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, our catalyst shows more than 250 hours of stability at a water&#8208;splitting current of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 , indicating its potential for practical applications. Experimental characterizations reveal the presence of a Ru&#8208;based oxide nanosheath on the surface of the catalyst during OER tests, suggesting a surface reconstruction process that enhances the intrinsic activity and inhibits continuous metal dissolution. Moreover, density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the introduction of Fe into the RuFe@CF catalyst reduces the energy barrier and boosts its activities. This work offers an effective and universal strategy for the development of highly efficient and stable catalysts for acidic water splitting. This article is protected by copyright.

      <title>Enhancing the Performance of Nickel Electrocatalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction Using Arrays of Self-Cleaning Linear Ridges</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsaem.3c03187</link>

                The oxygen evolution reaction represents a key source of inefficiency for green hydrogen production. In general, persistent bubbles that grow on the surfaces of an electrode obstruct a portion of the electrochemically active surface area, resulting in a decreased overall efficiency. Microscale features on the surfaces of electrocatalysts can, however, aid in the removal of these adherent bubbles. Gas production and conversion efficiencies have been shown to improve when incorporating linear, ridge-like microscale features onto electrodes. These factors improve with an increase in the separation between these ridges as demonstrated for features with separations up to 200 &#956;m, but the full extent of this trend is not known. In this study, a series of linear, ridge-like features were prepared to seek a separation between these features that yields an optimal performance. The ridge-like features were prepared from nickel (Ni) using microscope project lithography techniques in combination with Ni electrodeposition, which was demonstrated to be a versatile technique for rapidly prototyping these features. At an industrially relevant potential of 1.8 V [vs mercury/mercury oxide (Hg/HgO)] in an alkaline electrolyte, the performance of arrays of the ridge-like features was observed to increase up to a critical separation of &#8764;300 &#956;m, beyond which the performance decreased and approached that of planar Ni electrocatalysts. At this identified critical separation of features, the current response under chronoamperometry conditions was nearly triple that obtained for the planar Ni electrocatalysts. Observations of growth, coalescence, and detachment of gas bubbles on the microscale ridge-like features achieved using high-speed imaging suggest a possible cause for the improved performance at the identified optimal spacing of the arrays of linear features.</description>

                Exploiting low-cost and efficient transition metal-based oxygen evolution catalysts is significant for water splitting. Herein, the composite catalyst (NiFeS2/NiFe-LDH) with the flower-like nanostructure was prepared on the surface of nickel&#8211;iron binary alloy. The sulfuretted catalyst displays larger Cdl (8.8 mF cm&#8722;2) and higher TOF (0.44 s&#8722;1). It also showed a low overpotential of 223 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, it shows excellent stability at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 100 mA cm&#8722;2 for 10 h without a noticeable activity loss. The strategy of combining layered double hydroxides with transition bimetallic sulfides may provide important insights for the exploitation of low-cost and high-activity OER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Synergetic effect of both cation and anion doping cobalt oxides on V2C MXene boosting oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234422</link>
      <description>Zicong Yang, Yanhui Chen, Yukun Chang, Xiangxian Song, Jinshu Wang, Hongyi Li, Journal of power sources. 604(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394018417

                In order to enhance the conductivity and catalytic efficiency of non-noble electrocatalyst, an electrocatalysts consisting of ZnCo metallic double oxide with S doping embedded on V2C MXene for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is synthesized. Cobalt serves as the primary active site, while zinc contributes to improve conductivity owing to its high electronegativity. Sulfur doping plays a crucial role in reducing the energy barrier of rate determining step of OER. The V2C MXene as a substrate can promote conductivity as well, resulting in synergistic effect. The electrocatalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline electrolyte, surpassing that of IrO2 commercial electrocatalyst. The potential shows only a minimal &#8764;5 mV day after 72-h stability test at 20 mA cm&#8722;2. The current density at 1.6 V vs RHE is 2 times that of commercial IrO2. Both theoretical calculation and experimental result demonstrate the advantage brought by the incorporation of zinc and sulfur. This work introduces a new idea of synergetic effect in non-noble metallic electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Surface functionalization of nickel foam with two-dimensional conjugated MOFs Fe3(hexaiminotriphenylene)2 for highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inoche.2024.112385</link>
      <description>Yulong Zhou, Rui Li, Yu Zhou, Chuanping Li, Feng&#8208;Cui Shen, Rongmei Liu, Xiandong Zhu, Inorganic chemistry communications/Inorganic chemistry communications (Online). 163(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394065226

                The design of high-efficient, low-cost, and stable electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly demanding for energy conversion applications. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with large surface area and flexible molecular species, can supply atom-dispersed metal active coordination sites (M&#8722;NX, M&#8722;SX, M&#8722;OX) for OER and have been regarded as potential catalysts for practical applications. However, it is still challenging to use MOFs as OER catalysts directly due to their low conductivity and poor stability. Herein, we successfully synthesized a 2D c-MOF of Fe3(HITP)2 (HITP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene) on the surface of nickel foam (NF) by using a layer-by-layer self-assembly strategy. The Fe3(HITP)2/NF-x electrode (x = 5, 10, 15, 20 is the number of cycles) exhibited impressive OER catalytic activity in alkaline electrolyte (1 M KOH), which is superior or comparable to most of the transition metal-based materials reported. Typically, Fe3(HITP)2/NF-15 were able to fully expose the Fe-N4 catalytic sites with an overpotential of 224 mV at a current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 45.4 mV&#183;dec-1. This was mainly attributed to the higher ECSA value, better kinetic process, and fast charge transfer ability of Fe3(HITP)2/NF. In addition, the current density of Fe3(HITP)2/NF-15 remained at 97.3 % of the initial current density after 24 h i-t stability test, showing excellent catalytic stability. This work provided a novel design strategy for the direct application of MOFs to OER applications.</description>

      <title>Tracking the structural evolution and activity origin of Co-doped NiFe layered double hydroxide for enhanced oxygen evolution reaction</title>

      <description>Yanyan Wu, Ying Liu, Zijuan Xie, Yan Wang, Yanan Wang, Bo Wei, Chemical engineering journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394566117

                Development non-precious electrocatalysts in oxygen evolution reactions (OER) with excellent activity and durability is of great significance but challenging for electrochemical water splitting. Herein, under the guidance of theoretical calculation, we report that in-situ Co-doped NiFe (NiFeCo) LDH is an excellent catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and its activity and durability are superior to NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH). The dynamic evolution of its structure/composition is uncovered by in-situ Raman and UV&#8211;vis spectroscopies, in which Co doping reduces the Ni oxidation potential and accelerates the formation of highly active Ni(Co)1-xFexOOH species during OER. The reconstructed product catalyzes the OER with low overpotential of 261 and 318 mV at 100 and 500 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, and maintains outstanding stability for at least 300 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.0 M KOH. Our findings not only deepen the basic understanding of the OER process of this material, but also provide theoretical basis and practical guidance for the further development of new low-cost electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Polyaniline Induced Trivalent Ni in Laser-Fabricated Nickel Oxides for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                Although it is generally acknowledged that transition metals at high oxidation states represent superior oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, the preparation and stability of such a high-valence state are still a challenge, which requires relatively harsh reaction conditions and is unstable under ambient conditions. Herein, we report the formation of trivalent nickel (Ni3+) in laser-fabricated nickel oxides induced by polyaniline (PANI) under electrochemical activation via a significant charge transfer between Ni and N, as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Thereafter, the presence of Ni3+ and the improved conductivity by PANI effectively increase the electrochemical OER activity of the samples together with excellent long-term stability. This work provides new insights for the rational manufacture of high-valence metal for electrochemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Promotion of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction via Programmable Metal Oxides</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsenergylett.4c00365</link>
      <description>Sallye R. Gathmann, Christopher J. Bartel, Lars C. Grabow, Omar A. Abdelrahman, C. Daniel Frisbie, Paul J. Dauenhauer, ACS energy letters. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394568896

                Hydrogen gas is a promising renewable energy storage medium when produced via water electrolysis, but this process is limited by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we used a microkinetic model to investigate promoting the OER using programmable oxide catalysts (i.e., forced catalyst dynamics). We found that programmable catalysts could increase current density at a fixed overpotential (100&#8211;600&#215; over static rates) or reduce the overpotential required to reach a fixed current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 (45&#8211;140% reduction vs static). In our kinetic parametrization, the key parameters controlling the quality of the catalytic ratchet were the O*-to-OOH* and O*-to-OH* activation barriers. Our findings indicate that programmable catalysts may be a viable strategy for accelerating the OER or enabling lower-overpotential operation, but a more accurate kinetic parametrization is required for precise predictions of performance, ratchet quality, and resulting energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Recent Advancements on Spin Engineering Strategies for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202401057</link>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a widely employed half-electrode reaction in oxygen electrochemistry, in applications such as hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, ammonia synthesis, and electrocatalytic hydrogenation. Unfortunately, its slow kinetics limits the commercialization of such applications. It is therefore highly imperative to develop highly robust electrocatalysts with high activity, long-term durability, and low noble-metal contents. Previously intensive efforts have been made to introduce the advancements on developing non-precious transition metal electrocatalysts and their OER mechanisms. Electronic structure tuning is one of the most effective and interesting ways to boost OER activity and spin angular momentum is an intrinsic property of the electron. Therefore, modulation on the spin states and the magnetic properties of the electrocatalyst enables the changes on energy associated with interacting electron clouds with radical absorbance, affecting the OER activity and stability. Given that few review efforts have been made on this topic, in this review, the-state-of-the-art research progress on spin-dependent effects in OER will be briefed. Spin engineering strategies, such as strain, crystal surface engineering, crystal doping, etc., will be introduced. The related mechanism for spin manipulation to boost OER activity will also be discussed. Finally, the challenges and prospects for the development of spin catalysis are presented. This review aims to highlight the significance of spin engineering in breaking the bottleneck of electrocatalysis and promoting the practical application of high-efficiency electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Facile and adjustable production of self&#8211;standing oxygen&#8211;doped graphene membranes for optimized oxygen evolution electrocatalysis</title>

                Owing to abundant resource and affordable price, metal&#8211;free carbon has been extensively studied in the field of oxygen reduction reaction, while the related studies on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are quite few. In this work, a facile and scalable knife coating coupled with annealing strategy is proposed to produce self&#8211;standing oxygen&#8211;doped graphene membranes (marked as O&#8211;GM&#8211;T, T represents the annealing temperature). Through systematic characterization and analysis, it is discovered the annealing treatment not only decreases the amount of oxygenic groups, but allows for controlled regulation of the oxygen configurations, leaving only C&#8211;OH/C&#8211;O&#8211;C and CO. Meanwhile, theoretical calculations indicate that the OER activity trend of different oxygen configurations is as follows: &#8211;COOH &#8203;&gt; &#8203;CO &#8203;&#8776; &#8203;C&#8211;OH &#8203;&gt; &#8203;C&#8211;O&#8211;C. Despite the removal of highly active &#8211;COOH group through annealing treatment, the resulting O&#8211;GM&#8211;800 sample maintains good mechanical property and achieves a favorable balance on conductivity, hydrophilicity and catalytic sites. Consequently, it displays significantly improved OER performance compared to the counterparts, making it highly promising for applications in overall water splitting devices. Apparently, our work provides guidance for the rational design and controllable fabrication of self&#8211;standing carbon&#8211;based catalysts for energy&#8211;related reactions.</description>

                Abstract Rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZAB) represent a promising avenue for sustainable energy storage, boasting high energy density, cost&#8208;effectiveness, scalability, and environmental friendliness. However, the sluggish redox kinetics and limited cycle life of bifunctional oxygen evolution/reduction (OER/ORR) electrocatalysts impede the further practical development of ZABs. In this study, homogenic boundary effect within &#945;/&#946;&#8208;NiMoO 4 is introduced as a superior electrocatalyst for ZAB. Through in situ poikilothermic X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and theoretical investigations, the active Ni atoms exhibit more effective electron transfer at &#945;/&#946;&#8208;NiMoO 4 due to the homogenic boundary effect is unveiled. Furthermore, the presence of oxygen vacancies and lattice distortions at these boundaries significantly reduces the thermodynamic barrier of OER to a mere 0.46 V. Consequently, &#945;/&#946;&#8208;NiMoO 4 demonstrates a remarkably low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 for the bottlenecked OER, along with prolonged durability (150 h) and a high specific capacity (745 mAh g &#8722;1 at 5 mA cm &#8722;2 ) for ZAB. This study underscores the efficacy of homogenic boundary effects in enhancing electrocatalytic activities, offering great promise for the advancement of sustainable energy systems.</description>

      <title>Surface oxidation/spin state determines oxygen evolution reaction activity of cobalt-based catalysts in acidic environment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-47409-y</link>
      <description>Jinzhen Huang, Camelia N. Borca, Thomas Huthwelker, Nur Sena Y&#252;zbasi, Dominika Baster, Mario El Kazzi, Claudia Schneider, Thomas J. Schmidt, Emiliana Fabbri, Nature communications. 15(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394604266

                Abstract Co-based catalysts are promising candidates to replace Ir/Ru-based oxides for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis in an acidic environment. However, both the reaction mechanism and the active species under acidic conditions remain unclear. In this study, by combining surface-sensitive soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy characterization with electrochemical analysis, we discover that the acidic OER activity of Co-based catalysts are determined by their surface oxidation/spin state. Surfaces composed of only high-spin Co II are found to be not active due to their unfavorable water dissociation to form Co III -OH species. By contrast, the presence of low-spin Co III is essential, as it promotes surface reconstruction of Co oxides and, hence, OER catalysis. The correlation between OER activity and Co oxidation/spin state signifies a breakthrough in defining the structure-activity relationship of Co-based catalysts for acidic OER, though, interestingly, such a relationship does not hold in alkaline and neutral environments. These findings not only help to design efficient acidic OER catalysts, but also deepen the understanding of the reaction mechanism.</description>

      <title>Core&#8211;Shell CoS2@MoS2 with Hollow Heterostructure as an Efficient Electrocatalyst for Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29081695</link>

                It is imperative to develop an efficient catalyst to reduce the energy barrier of electrochemical water decomposition. In this study, a well-designed electrocatalyst featuring a core&#8211;shell structure was synthesized with cobalt sulfides as the core and molybdenum disulfide nanosheets as the shell. The core&#8211;shell structure can prevent the agglomeration of MoS2, expose more active sites, and facilitate electrolyte ion diffusion. A CoS2/MoS2 heterostructure is formed between CoS2 and MoS2 through the chemical interaction, and the surface chemistry is adjusted. Due to the morphological merits and the formation of the CoS2/MoS2 heterostructure, CoS2@MoS2 exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process in an alkaline electrolyte. To reach the current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, only 254 mV of overpotential is required for CoS2@MoS2, which is smaller than that of pristine CoS2 and MoS2. Meanwhile, the small Tafel slope (86.9 mV dec&#8722;1) and low charge transfer resistance (47 &#937;) imply the fast dynamic mechanism of CoS2@MoS2. As further confirmed by cyclic voltammetry curves for 1000 cycles and the CA test for 10 h, CoS2@MoS2 shows exceptional catalytic stability. This work gives a guideline for constructing the core&#8211;shell heterostructure as an efficient catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction.</description>

      <title>Reversing the Interfacial Electric Field in Metal Phosphide Heterojunction by Fe&#8208;Doping for Large&#8208;Current Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                Developing non-precious-metal electrocatalysts that can operate with a low overpotential at a high current density for industrial application is challenging. Heterogeneous bimetallic phosphides have attracted much interest. Despite high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance, the ordinary oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance hinders their practical use. Herein, it is shown that Fe-doping reverses and enlarges the interfacial electrical field at the heterojunction, turning the H intermediate favorable binding sites for HER into O intermediate favorable sites for OER. Specifically, the self-supported heterojunction catalysts on nickel foam (CoP@Ni2P/NF and Fe-CoP@Fe-Ni2P/NF) are readily synthesized. They only require the overpotentials of 266 and 274 mV to drive a large current density of 1000 mA cm-2 (j1000) for HER and OER, respectively. Furthermore, a water splitting cell equipped with these electrodes only requires a voltage of 1.724 V to drive j1000 with excellent durability, demonstrating the potential of industrial application. This work offers new insights on interfacial engineering for heterojunction catalysts.</description>

      <title>Template-assisted strategy for synthesizing transition metal oxyhydroxide for high-efficiency oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                Oxyhydroxides have been widely recognized as the true active species for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), while most of them are created via the complicated and time-consuming electrochemical activation process. Here, we develop a facile template-mediated method for directly synthesizing highly active oxyhydroxides toward OER. The optimal FeCoOOH prepared via using Cu2O as a sacrificial template could exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic OER performance, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm-2 with the overpotential of merely 320 mV, and a corresponding Tafel slope of 77.5 mV dec-1. Detailed mechanism study outlines that the extraordinary OER performance of such FeCoOOH originated from the intrinsically high OER activity of oxyhydroxide and the high specific surface area of the particular architecture. This work demonstrates a simple and direct route for the successful fabrication of highly active oxyhydroxides, which may open a new way for the synthesis of other active species.</description>

                Designing highly active and robust earth abundant trifunctional electrocatalysts for energy storage and conversion applications remain an enormous challenge. Herein, we report a trifunctional electrocatalyst (CrCo/CoN4@CNT-5), synthesized at low calcination temperature (550 &#176;C), which consists of Co&#8211;N4 single atom and CrCo alloy nanoparticles and exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction, oxygen evolution reaction, and oxygen reduction reaction. The catalyst is able to deliver a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 in an alkaline electrolytic cell at a very low cell voltage of &#8764;1.60 V. When the catalyst is equipped in a liquid rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery, it endowed a high open-circuit voltage with excellent cycling durability and outperformed the commercial Pt/C+IrO2 catalytic system. Furthermore, the Zn&#8211;air battery powered self-driven water splitting system is displayed using CrCo/CoN4@CNT-5 as sole trifunctional catalyst, delivering a high H2 evolution rate of 168 &#956;mol h&#8211;1. Theoretical calculations reveal synergistic interaction between Co&#8211;N4 active sites and CrCo nanoparticles, favoring the Gibbs free energy for H2 evolution. The presence of Cr not only enhances the H2O adsorption and dissociation but also tunes the electronic property of CrCo nanoparticles to provide optimized hydrogen binding capacity to Co&#8211;N4 sites, thus giving rise to accelerated H2 evolution kinetics. This work highlights the importance of the presence of small quantity of Cr in enhancing the electrocatalytic activity as well as robustness of single-atom catalyst and suggests the design of the multifunctional robust electrocatalysts for long-term H2 evolution application.</description>

      <title>Role of the Morphology and Surface Planes on the Catalytic Activity of Spinel LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                The electrocatalytic activity of the spinel oxide LiMn1.5Ni0.5O4 withdifferent morphologies (cubic, spherical, octahedral, and truncated octahedral) has beeninvestigated for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solutions that is ofinterest for metal&#8722;air batteries. The OER activity increases in the order truncatedoctahedral &lt; cubic &lt; spherical &lt; octahedral, despite a larger surface area (2.9 m2 g&#8722;1) forthe spherical sample compared to nearly similar surface areas (0.3&#8722;0.7 m2 g&#8722;1) for theother three samples. The high activity of the octahedral sample is attributed to theregular octahedral shape with low-energy {111} surface planes, whereas the lowestactivity of the truncated octahedral sample is attributed to the high-energy {001} surfaceplanes. The octahedral sample also exhibits the lowest Tafel slope of 70 mV dec&#8722;1 withthe highest durability whereas the truncated octahedral sample exhibits the highest Tafelslope of 120 mV dec&#8722;1 with durability similar to the cubic and spherical samples. Thestudy demonstrates that the catalytic activities of oxide catalysts could be tuned andoptimized by controlling the surface morphologies/planes via novel synthesis approaches.</description>

                Development of efficient, affordable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction andthe oxygen reduction reaction is critical for rechargeable metal-air batteries. Here we presentlithium cobalt oxide, synthesized at 400 C (designated as LT-LiCoO2) that adopts a lithiatedspinel structure, as an inexpensive, efficient electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction.The catalytic activity of LT-LiCoO2 is higher than that of both spinel cobalt oxide and layeredlithium cobalt oxide synthesized at 800 C (designated as HT-LiCoO2) for the oxygen evolutionreaction. Although LT-LiCoO2 exhibits poor activity for the oxygen reduction reaction,the chemically delithiated LT-Li1 xCoO2 samples exhibit a combination of high oxygenreduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activities, making the spinel-type LTLi0,5CoO2a potential bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable metal-air batteries. Thehigh activities of these delithiated compositions are attributed to the Co4O4 cubane subunitsand a pinning of the Co3 &#254; /4 &#254; :3d energy with the top of the O2 :2p band.DO</description>

      <title>Silver nanoparticles induced reactive oxygen species via photosynthetic energy transport imbalance in an aquatic plant</title>

                The rapid growth in silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) commercialization has increased environmental exposure, including aquatic ecosystem. It has been reported that the AgNPs have damaging effects on photosynthesis and induce oxidative stress, but the toxic mechanism of AgNPs is still a matter of debate. In the present study, on the model aquatic higher plant Spirodela polyrhiza, we found that AgNPs affect photosynthesis and significantly inhibit Photosystem II (PSII) maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) and effective quantum yield (&#934;PSII). The changes of non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ), light-induced non-photochemical fluorescence quenching [Y(NPQ)] and non-light-induced non-photochemical fluorescence quenching [Y(NO)] showed that AgNPs inhibit the photo-protective capacity of PSII. AgNPs induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are mainly produced in the chloroplast. The activity of ribulose-1, 5-bisphosphate carboxylase&#8211;oxygenase (Rubisco) was also very sensitive to AgNPs. The internalized Ag, regardless of whether the exposure was Ag+ or AgNPs had the same capacity to generate ROS. Our results support the hypothesis that intra-cellular AgNP dissociate into high toxic Ag+. Rubisco inhibition leads to slowing down of CO2 assimilation. Consequently, the solar energy consumption decreases and then the excess excitation energy promotes ROS generation in chloroplast.</description>

                Implementation of chemical energy storage for a sustainable energy supply requires the rational improvement of electrocatalyst materials, for which their nature under reaction conditions needs to be revealed. For a better understanding of earth-abundant metal oxides as electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the combination of electrochemical (EC) methods and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is very insightful, yet still holds untapped potential. Herein, we concisely introduce EC and XAS, providing the necessary framework to discuss changes that electrocatalytic materials undergo during preparation and storage, during immersion in an electrolyte, as well as during application of potentials, showing Mn oxides as examples. We conclude with a summary of how EC and XAS are currently combined to elucidate active states, as well as an outlook on opportunities to understand the mechanisms of electrocatalysis using combined operando EC-XAS experiments.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of a Mn-Co oxide during oxygen evolution in alkaline media</title>

                Improving the stability of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) through materials design has received less attention than improving their catalytic activity. We explored the effects of Mn addition to a cobalt oxide for stabilizing the catalyst by comparing single phase CoOx and (Co0.7Mn0.3)Ox films electro&#173;deposited in alkaline solution. The obtained disordered films were classified as layered oxides using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The CoOx films showed a constant decrease in the catalytic activity during cycling, confirmed by oxygen detection, while that of (Co0.7Mn0.3)Ox remained constant within error as measured by electrochemical metrics. These trends were rationalized based on XAS analysis of the metal oxidation states, which were Co2.7+ and Mn3.7+ in the bulk and similar near the surface of (Co0.7Mn0.3)Ox, before and after cycling. Thus, Mn in (Co0.7Mn0.3)Ox successfully stabilized the bulk catalyst material and its surface activity during OER cycling. The development of stabilization approaches is essential to extend the durability of OER catalysts.</description>

                This dataset was used to generate the figures in the abovementioned paper, accepted for publication in Nature Communications. Paper abstract: The oxygenation of early Earth&#8217;s atmosphere during the Great Oxidation Event, is generally accepted to have been caused by oceanic Cyanobacterial oxygenic photosynthesis. Recent studies suggest that Fe(II) toxicity delayed the Cyanobacterial expansion necessary for the GOE. This study investigates the effects of Fe(II) on two Cyanobacteria, Pseudanabaena sp. PCC7367 and Synechococcus sp. PCC7336, in a simulated shallow-water marine Archean environment. A similar Fe(II) toxicity response was observed as reported for closed batch cultures. This toxicity was not observed in cultures provided with continuous gaseous exchange that showed significantly shorter doubling times than the closed-culture system, even with repeated nocturnal addition of Fe(II) for 12 days. The green rust formed under high Fe(II) conditions, was not found to be directly toxic to Pseudanabaena sp. PCC7367. In summary, we present evidence of diurnal Fe cycling in a simulated shallow-water marine environment for two ancestral strains of Cyanobacteria, with increased O2 production under anoxic conditions.</description>

                Research on novel electrocatalysts with high activity, stability, and economic feasibility for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is important to the wide application of water electrolyzers. Here, two novel quinoline complexes, L-Co and L-Fe, are synthesized and their crystal structure and electrochemical properties are systematically investigated. Electropolymerization using these complexes are successfully carried out on carbon cloth. The copolymer (P&#8211;Co&#8211;Fe) is active towards OER in 1 M KOH, with 298 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current densities. Kinetic analyses suggest the P&#8211;Co&#8211;Fe follows both the adsorbate evolution and lattice oxygen evolution mechanistic pathways. Lower Tafel slope value, lower charge transfer resistance and lower apparent activation energy all suggest enhacned intrinsic activity of the P&#8211;Co&#8211;Fe, which stem from the electron interaction between the Co and Fe moieties. The P&#8211;Co&#8211;Fe exhibits stability in 1 M KOH over 24 h, with partial decomposition and the formation of oxides/hydroxides.</description>

      <title>Insights into mechanism of peroxymonosufate activation by Mo single-atom catalysts: Singlet oxygen evolution and role of Mo&#8211;N coordination</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2024.120846</link>
      <description>Yinlong Guo, Chao Ma, Zhiyuan Gao, Mingzhen Wu, Chung&#8208;Hua Shen, Zhihua Xu, Journal of environmental management. 358(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394632837

                Recently, the Fenton-like reaction using peroxymonosulfate (PMS) has been acknowledged as a potential method for breaking down organic pollutants. In this study, we successfully synthesized a highly efficient and stable single atom molybdenum (Mo) catalyst dispersed on nitrogen-doped carbon (Mo-NC-0.1). This catalyst was then utilized for the first time to activate PMS and degrade bisphenol A (BPA). The Mo-NC-0.1/PMS system demonstrated the ability to completely degrade BPA within just 20 min. Scavenging tests and density functional theory (DFT) calculations have demonstrated that the primary reactive oxygen species was singlet oxygen (1O2) produced by Mo-N4 sites. The self-cycling of Mo facilitated PMS activation and the transition from a free radical activation pathway to a non-radical pathway mediated by 1O2. Simultaneously, the nearby pyridinic N served as adsorption sites to immobilize BPA and PMS molecules. The exceptionally high catalytic activity of Mo-NC-0.1 derived from its unique Mo-N coordination, which markedly reduced the distance for 1O2 to migrate to the BPA molecules. The Mo-NC-0.1/PMS system effectively reduced the acute toxicity of BPA and exhibited excellent cycling stability with minimal leaching. This study presented a new catalyst with high selectivity for 1O2 generation and provided valuable insights for the application of single atom catalysts in PMS-based AOPs.</description>

      <title>Oxygen fugacity evolution of the mantle lithosphere beneath the North China Craton</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.17285255</link>
      <description>Chenyang Ye, Jifeng Ying, Yanjie Tang, Xin-Fu Zhao, Hongfu Zhang, Figshare. None(None)] 2021. https://openalex.org/W4394381054

                Oxygen fugacity controls the behaviour of multivalent elements and compositions of C-O-H fluids in Earth&#8217;s mantle, which further affects the cycling of materials between the deep interior and surface of Earth. The redox state of the mantle lithosphere of typical stable cratons has been well documented, but how oxygen fugacity had varied during craton destruction remains unclear. This study estimates the oxygen fugacity of peridotite xenoliths entrained in Mesozoic and Cenozoic basalts on North China Craton (NCC), a typical destroyed craton. The oxygen fugacity vs. Mg# of olivine reveals that the mantle lithosphere beneath the NCC experienced three stages of evolution in terms of oxygen fugacity. First, the refractory and oxidized peridotite xenoliths indicate that the lithospheric mantle experienced a high degree of melt extraction and later long-term and complicated metasomatism before craton destruction. Then, the variations of olivine Mg-number in peridotites and oxygen fugacity reveal significant metasomatism by melts originated from the shallow asthenosphere during the destruction of the NCC since the Mesozoic. The third stage may have occurred when mantle peridotites interacted with silica-undersaturated melts or fluids stemmed from the mantle transition zone where the stagnant Pacific slab underlies. This study further verifies that the asthenospheric convection induced by the roll-back of the subducted paleo-Pacific slab played a crucial role in the destruction of the NCC and helps understand the oxygen fugacity variability during the later life of the craton.</description>

      <title>The response mechanism of transversal mixing of dissolved oxygen to the evolution of secondary flow at the confluence</title>

                In the natural river network, the confluences play an important role as control nodes. It is of great scientific value to study the transport and mixing process of water quality at the confluence of the mainstream and tributaries to improve the health of the river environment. In this study, dissolved oxygen (DO, the essential survival conditions for aquatic organisms) was used as a water quality index, and a 3D transport model of DO considering atmospheric reoxygenation and biodegradation oxygen consumption was constructed. The hydrodynamic mechanism of DO transport, mixing and reoxygenation at confluence under different flow ratios, junction angles and water temperature conditions was studied. The results show that the secondary flow is the main driving force of the transversal mixing at confluence, and there is a high coupling relationship between the evolution of the secondary flow and the mixing process of water quality at confluence. With the increase of flow ratio and junction angle, the intensity of secondary flow at confluence shows an exponential increase, which in turn promotes the transversal mixing efficiency of DO at confluence. The water quality of the polluted confluence under different water temperature conditions showed a trend of gradual recovery, but the higher the water temperature, the weaker the recovery rate. This study can provide theoretical support to deal with the threat to aquatic organisms caused by pollution accumulation at confluence, and provide scientific basis for the improvement of the water environment and water ecology protection in the river confluence and downstream.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Response and Microstructure Evolution of Oxygen-Free High-Conductivity Copper Liner in Explosively Formed Projectile</title>

                Abstract The dynamic response and microstructure evolution of oxygen-free high-conductivity copper in a shaped charge liner are investigated through microstructural examination of a soft-recovery EFP. Adiabatic shear bands and voids which is the failure original of copper EFP can be observed in the rear part of the projectile. Numerical simulation results illustrate that the highest plastic strain reaches about 2.9 which can fully accommodate the grains deformation of copper EFP during the formation process at strain rates of the order of 104s&#8722;1. Theoretical calculation results indicate that the highest temperature increase of EFP caused by shock wave and plastic deformation can reach 747K, which is 0.55T m (where T m is the melting temperature of copper). The main body of the EFP undergoes completely dynamic recrystallisation, and the average size of the refined grains significantly decreases to approximately 10&#181;m. A slight increase in grain size occurs mainly away from the center and extends towards the head and rear sections of the EFP. During the DRX process, the dislocation movement is believed to be the controlling mechanism significantly refining the microstructure.</description>

                The constraint of temperature evolution in coastal environments is an important factor in deciphering the Earth&#8217;s global climatic history. In this study, we reconstruct the evolution of sea-surface palaeotemperatures from the oxygen stable isotope compositions in four marine molluscs families in the Paris Basin during the Palaeogene. The combination of several taxa living in different environments is used to limit uncertainties related to the influence of salinity variations on palaeotemperature estimations. One family of bivalves (oysters) and three families of gastropods (Volutidae, Cerithiidae and Turritellidae) were sampled in the French part of the Paris Basin, in Belgium and in the Isle of Wight (southern England). Maximum seawater temperatures were observed during the Early Eocene (c. 30&#176;C), which correspond to the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum, and temperatures then decreased until the Lutetian (c. 20&#176;C). A transient warming, identified as the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum, occurred during the Bartonian, when temperatures reached 32&#176;C. Temperatures decreased through the Eocene&#8211;Oligocene boundary, the coolest interval of the Palaeogene (c. 12&#176;C). A final warming period occurred throughout the Early Oligocene, with temperatures reaching 24&#176;C. The fossils analysed thus record the global climatic intervals of the Palaeogene.</description>

                Based on reactive force field (ReaxFF) simulation, the molecular evolution mechanism of air combustion simulation and pure oxygen combustion simulation of Changqing petroleum coke was studied. On the basis of the original petroleum coke molecular model, N2 and O2 molecules were added to construct the air combustion simulation model and the pure oxygen combustion simulation model respectively. The number of molecules, main products, and typical hydrocarbon gases in the two simulation results were analyzed by setting up the LAMMPS in. file. Finally, the molecular changes of pyrrole and pyridine were described. The results show that the main reaction interval of pure oxygen combustion is earlier than that of air combustion. In the main reaction temperature range, the reaction rate of pure oxygen combustion is higher than that of simulated air combustion. At 170 ps, the two simulations reaction speed is the fastest time point; Pyridine is more stable than pyrrole. The research on the distinction and comparison of two kinds of simulation has certain guiding significance for the clean utilization of petroleum coke combustion process in industry.</description>

                This file gathers the supplementary material and datasets related to the publication "Stable oxygen isotopes of crocodilian tooth enamel allow tracking Plio-Pleistocene evolution of freshwater environments and climate in the Shungura Formation (Turkana Depression, Ethiopia)" published in Biogeosciences. This study utilizes stable oxygen isotopes (&#948;18Op) in fossil crocodilian teeth to assess paleohydrology and paleoclimates. Crocodilian teeth, widely available in continental basins since the Mesozoic era, provide a valuable archive for tracking freshwater environmental changes due to their durable enamel phosphate, which preserves their original isotopic composition over geological timescales. The research applies this approach for the first time to the Shungura Formation in the Lower Omo Valley, Ethiopia, a crucial area for understanding environmental shifts in eastern Africa during the Plio-Pleistocene, impacting regional ecosystems, including humans. The &#948;18Op of coexisting crocodilians reveals (1) stable aquatic environments in the northern Turkana Depression from 2.97 Ma to around 2.57 Ma, followed by a decline in local waterbody diversity after 2.32 Ma, indicative of increasing aridity, and (2) a significant increase in &#948;18Ow from 2.97 Ma to about 1.14 Ma, likely influenced by changing air stream convergence zones between the West African and Indian Summer Monsoons and/or reduced rainfall over the Ethiopian Highlands.

                This file gathers the supplementary material and datasets related to the publication "Stable oxygen isotopes of crocodilian tooth enamel allow tracking Plio-Pleistocene evolution of freshwater environments and climate in the Shungura Formation (Turkana Depression, Ethiopia)" published in Biogeosciences. This study utilizes stable oxygen isotopes (&#948;18Op) in fossil crocodilian teeth to assess paleohydrology and paleoclimates. Crocodilian teeth, widely available in continental basins since the Mesozoic era, provide a valuable archive for tracking freshwater environmental changes due to their durable enamel phosphate, which preserves their original isotopic composition over geological timescales. The research applies this approach for the first time to the Shungura Formation in the Lower Omo Valley, Ethiopia, a crucial area for understanding environmental shifts in eastern Africa during the Plio-Pleistocene, impacting regional ecosystems, including humans. The &#948;18Op of coexisting crocodilians reveals (1) stable aquatic environments in the northern Turkana Depression from 2.97 Ma to around 2.57 Ma, followed by a decline in local waterbody diversity after 2.32 Ma, indicative of increasing aridity, and (2) a significant increase in &#948;18Ow from 2.97 Ma to about 1.14 Ma, likely influenced by changing air stream convergence zones between the West African and Indian Summer Monsoons and/or reduced rainfall over the Ethiopian Highlands.

                Cyanobacteria (Synechococcus sp., Synechocystis sp. and Chroococcidiopsis cubana) were immobilised in synthetic latex with halloysite to create porous biocoatings. Hardness measurements of this latex were performed first. Toxicity of the liquid latex was then assessed and biocoating structures were visualised using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX). Finally, oxygen evolution of the biocoating was measured.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent electronic structure of bixbyite &#945;-Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the importance of a subtle structural change on oxygen electrocatalysis</title>

      <description>Junais Habeeb Mokkath, Maryam Jahan, Masahiko Tanaka, Satoshi Tominaka, Joel Henzie, Figshare. None(None)] 2021. https://openalex.org/W4394104396

                Bixbyite &#945;-Mn2O3 is an inexpensive Earth-abundant mineral that can be used to drive both oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) in alkaline conditions. It possesses a subtle orthorhombic &#8594; cubic phase change near room temperature that suppresses Jahn&#8211;Teller distortions and presents a unique opportunity to study how atomic structure affects the electronic structure and catalytic activity at a temperature range that is easily accessible in OER/ORR experiments. Previously, we observed that heat-treated &#945;-Mn2O3 had a better performance as a bifunctional catalyst in the oxygen evolution (OER) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) (Dalton Trans. 2016, 45, 18,494&#8211;18,501). We hypothesized that heat-treatment pinned the material into a more electrochemically active cubic phase. In this manuscript, we use high-resolution X-ray diffraction to collect the temperature-dependent structures of &#945;-Mn2O3, and then input them into ab initio calculations. The electronic structure calculations indicate that the orthorhombic &#8594; cubic phase transition causes the Mn 3d and O 2p bands to overlap and mix covalently, transforming &#945;-Mn2O3 from a semiconductor to a semimetal. This subtle change in structure also modifies Mn-O-Mn bond distances, which may improve the activity of the material in oxygen electrochemistry. OER and ORR experiments were performed using the same electrode at various temperatures. They show a jump in the exchange current density near the phase change temperature, demonstrating the higher activity of the cubic phase.</description>

                ABSTRACT The surface area of Ti/TiO2-Pt electrodes (ASr) in contact with 0.010 M HClO4 solutions was determined by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) techniques. The Ti/Pt/TiO2 electrodes with different amounts of electrodeposited Pt (1, 5 and 10 seconds) were polarized up to 1.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) and stabilized at the final potential during 15 minutes. The highest limit of oxygen adsorption and/or oxide formation was choosen for potentials before the oxygen evolution, and the current corresponding to the region were the oxygen desorption takes place was integrated. These values were used as a parameter to determine the ASr for the different electrodes. The results demonstrate that the Ti/Pt/TiO2 (10 seconds) electrodes have the largest area in contact with the electrolyte. A second method used to determine the ASr was AFM. The results obtained by the two methods were in good correlation.</description>

                The bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst is the Achilles' heel of achieving robust reversible Zn-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, durable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis in alkaline media is realized on atomic Fe-N4-C sites reinforced by NixCo3-xO4 (NixCo3-xO4@Fe1/NC). Compared with that of pristine Fe1/NC, the stability of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is increased 10 times and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance is also improved. The steric hindrance alters the valence electron at the Fe-N4-C sites, resulting in a shorter Fe-N bond and enhanced stability of the Fe-N4-C sites. The corresponding solid-state ZABs exhibit an ultralong lifespan (&gt;460 h at 5 mA cm-2) and high rate performance (from 2 to 50 mA cm-2). Furthermore, the structural evolution of NixCo3-xO4@Fe1/NC before and after the OER and ORR as well as charge-discharge cycling is explored. This work develops an efficient strategy for improving bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysis and possibly other processes.</description>

                The main and significant element in the energy system is hydrogen atom. In addition, electrochemical water splitting is among the most crucial approaches for displacing the extensively utilized petroleum and petroleum products. It is crucial to look for effective electro-catalysts to split the water molecule to produce hydrogen. Because of their good conductivity, distinctive outer shell electronic distribution, and various superficial structural nano-morphology, transition metal chalcogenides are very attractive as effective electrocatalysts for hydrogen production. Currently synthesized transition metal-built chalcogens (containing Sulfur, Selenium, and Tellurium) as efficient catalysts for general splitting of target water using hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), have been discussed in this review.</description>

                Abstract Atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) have emerged as a new frontier in electrocatalysis, enabling the study of electrocatalytic reactions on well&#8208;defined stable surfaces and rational electrocatalyst design based on atomic&#8208;level tailoring. In this review, we focus on the recent applications of these NCs to energy conversion reactions, including those involved in water splitting (hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions), fuel cell operation (oxygen reduction and hydrogen oxidation reactions), and electrochemical CO 2 reduction. Emblematic examples are used to highlight the roles of different NC parts, for example, core metal and surrounding ligands, and the significance of the electrode substrate. Finally, we discuss the perspectives of the future development and implementation of NC&#8208;based energy conversion systems.</description>

      <title>AC-electrochemical synthesis of H2O2 by breathing O2 in three-phase interface</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2024.109600</link>
      <description>Peng Du, Ruyue Wang, Bohan Deng, Wei Zhao, Xinyu Xie, Cheng Yang, Yuanzheng Long, Chong Yan, Xiwen He, Kai Huang, Ru Zhang, Ming Lei, Hui Wu, Nano energy. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394611320

                Conventional electrosynthesis of H2O2 through a two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) requires continuous O2 feeding as the reactant, which is produced by oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis. In principle, H2O2 can be directly synthesized from water once the 2e&#8722; ORR is coupled with OER in one electrode. Unfortunately, such effective coupling has not yet been established. Herein, we created a cyclic oxygen exhalation-inhalation for on-demand and on-site H2O2 production by coupling the OER and 2e&#8722; ORR with a facile alternating-current (AC) electrocatalytic process. By ingeniously manipulating the reaction interfaces and operating voltage, we achieved efficient and stable in-situ H2O2 production. The rapid oxygen transfer in the localized three-phase interface favors the sufficient electrochemical reactions. The AC-electrocatalytic system exhibits highest performance including H2O2 production rate of 90.16 mmol h-1 gcat-1. Moreover, such AC-electrocatalysis inspires a new strategy to combine multiple electrocatalytic reactions into one electrode for fundamental study and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Marine Phosphate Level During the Archean Constrained by the Global Redox Budget</title>

                Abstract Understanding the oceanic phosphate concentration is critical for understanding marine productivity and oxygen evolution throughout Earth history. During the Archean, estimates of marine phosphate levels range from scarce to enriched conditions. However, biogeochemical conditions required for sustaining high phosphate concentrations while retaining an anoxic atmosphere during the Archean remain ambiguous. Here, we employ a biogeochemical model of the marine phosphate cycle to determine the conditions under which oceanic phosphate levels could have been higher than present&#8208;day values during the Archean after the emergence of oxygenic photoautotrophs (OP). We show that, under the presence of OP, phosphate&#8208;rich oceans require the limitation by factors other than phosphate, or a high outgassing rate of reducing gases. If these conditions were not met, the occurrence of oceanic phosphate levels higher than present&#8208;day values during the Archean would require the absence of OP.</description>

                Abstract Photoelectrochemistry holds the promise of directly converting sunlight to valuable chemical products. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) methods, however, lag behind their electrochemical counterparts in terms of current density. In this work, we demonstrate that, by using concentrated sunlight, we can achieve current densities similar to electrochemical methods, but with lower energy input. Specifically, we combined the direct PEC oxidation of glycerol with the dark hydrogen evolution or CO 2 reduction in a membrane-separated continuous-flow PEC cell. We achieved over 110 mA cm &#8722;2 photocurrent density, which is at least an order of magnitude larger than those typically reported in the literature. We demonstrated that the product distribution of glycerol oxidation is notably different in PEC and electrochemical scenarios at the same current density, and the parasitic oxygen evolution reaction can be suppressed in the PEC case. This approach raises opportunities to drive complex electrochemical reactions in a more selective manner.</description>

                Electrochemical urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a promising alternative to oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for realizing energy-saving hydrogen production. Developing efficient electrocatalysts for UOR becomes a central challenge. Recently, amorphous materials have been extensively used as UOR catalysts because of their numerous defective sites and flexible electronic properties. In this review, recent advancements in the development of amorphous UOR electrocatalysts are analyzed. The UOR mechanism is discussed, and the design of amorphous catalysts is then analyzed. The main catalyst design strategies are illustrated, including nanostructure control, heteroatom doping, composition regulation, and heterostructure construction. Also, electrocatalysts' structure-performance correlation is interpreted. Perspectives in this field are proposed for guiding future studies on the development of high-performance amorphous catalysts towards energy sustainability.</description>

                The compositional and structural flexibility of functionalised two-dimensional metal carbonitrides or MXenes has been exploited through a combinatorial search for new materials that can act as catalysts for photo-assisted water splitting by absorbing sunlight with energy in the infra-red region. Detailed calculations on 49 Janus MXenes where two surfaces are of asymmetric nature are carried out by first-principles Density Functional Theory. A screening procedure is adopted to arrive at potential candidates. Our calculations predict four new materials whose surfaces can activate both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions upon splitting water, two out of which are infra-red active, and the rest are visible light-active. We have performed a detailed microscopic analysis to find out the interrelations of the structural model of surface functionalisation, the chemistry of the surfaces, the electronic structure, and the alignment of bands with respect to the reaction potentials that explain our results. Apart from these four compounds, we find thirteen other compounds that are suitable for either hydrogen evolution or oxygen reduction reactions. This study lays out a guideline for the systematic discovery of potential new catalysts for water splitting under sunlight irradiation.</description>

                Stabilizing active sites of non-iridium-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial, but remains a big challenge for hydrogen production by acidic water splitting. Here, we report that non-stoichiometric Ti oxides (TiOx) can safeguard the Ru sites through structural-confinement and charge-redistribution, thereby extending the catalyst lifetime in acid by 10 orders of magnitude longer compared to that of the stoichiometric one (Ru/TiO2). By exploiting the redox interaction-engaged strategy, the in situ growth of TiOx on Ti foam and the loading of Ru nanoparticles are realized in one step. The as-synthesized binder-free Ru/TiOx catalyst exhibits low OER overpotentials of 174 and 265 mV at 10 and 500 mA cm-2, respectively.

      <title>Revealing electronic state evolution of Co(II)/Co(III) in CoO (111) plane during OER process through magnetic measurement</title>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is one of the most important half-reactions related to metal-air batteries, fuel cells, and water-splitting. Due to the sluggish kinetic and multi-electron transfer, catalysts appear to be particularly important for the OER. Knowing the reaction mechanism is fundamental to developing new catalysts and improving OER efficiency. In this work, phase transition and atomic reconstruction on CoO (111) plane were revealed through ex-situ diffraction methods and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. At the same time, the electronic state evolution of Co(II)/Co(III) during the OER process has also been concluded by analyzing the magnetic properties. This work shows that during the OER process, Co(III) experiences surface electron rearrangement from IS (intermediate-spin state) to LS (low-spin state) and then returns to IS/HS (high-spin state) under high voltage region. This work provides a new view to reveal the reaction mechanism through the magnetic property and it can be extended to more magnetic 3d transition metals for future catalyst design.</description>

                The development of low-cost electrocatalysts to selectively oxidize methanol to formate to replace the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) will be beneficial to reduce the overpotential of electrocatalytic water splitting. Herein, we propose a one-step low-temperature strategy for anion and cation co-doping to reconstruct ZIF-67 into two-dimensional Mo, N co-doped Co(OH)2 [N-CoMo(OH)x]. The N-CoMo(OH)x only needs 1.36 V to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Meanwhile, N-CoMo(OH)x exhibits good stability at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 with Faraday efficiency of 98.1 %. The Mo6+ and N co-doping synergistically enhance the conductivity and dehydrogenation energy barrier of OCH2 intermediate species, leading to good catalytic performance. This work thus provides a strategy for designing anion and cation co-doped catalysts for methanol upgrading.</description>

                Cost-effective highly efficient and stable bifunctional oxygen catalysts are critical for practical applications of rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). In this study, a non-precious bifunctional FeCoNiCuMo high entropy alloy (HEA) catalyst was developed, exhibiting outstanding dual-functionality toward catalysis of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions, with an ultralow voltage gap (&#916;E10) of 0.67 V. The FeCoNiCuMo HEA based ZAB exhibited a high peak power density of 298 mW cm&#8722;2 at a high current density of 412 mA cm&#8722;2 and an outstanding cycling stability over 1576 cycles (788 h) at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with a minor voltage gap increase of 6.2 %. Incorporation of CoNi layered double hydroxide nanowire arrays to poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) gel electrolytes significantly enhanced the aqueous electrolyte adsorption and water retention capabilities and ionic conductivities of the PVA gel, leading to much improved efficiency and stability of the flexible ZAB (FZAB), with an increase in peak power densities from 72 to 102.9 mW cm&#8722;2 and a prolonged lifespan from 35 to 58 h at 5 mA cm&#8722;2. The FZAB exhibited excellent mechanical stability, with no variations in voltage gaps observed under increasing bending.</description>

                Atomically dispersed dual-site catalysts can regulate multiple reaction processes and provide synergistic functions based on diverse molecules and their interfaces. However, how to synthesize and stabilize dual-site single-atom catalysts (DACs) is confronted with challenges. Herein, we report a facile high-temperature gas-migration strategy to synthesize Fe-Ni DACs on nitrogen-doped carbon nanosheets (FeNiSAs/NC). FeNiSAs/NC exhibits a high half-wave potential (0.88 V) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a low overpotential of 410 mV at 10 mA cm-2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As an air electrode for Zn-air batteries (ZABs), it shows better performances in aqueous ZABs and excellent stability and flexibility in solid-state ZABs. The high specific surface area (1687.32 m2/g) of FeNiSAs/NC is conducive to electron transport. Density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the Fe sites are the active center, and Ni sites can significantly optimize the free energy of the oxygen-containing intermediate state on Fe sites, contributing to the improvement of ORR and the corresponding OER activities. This work can provide guidance for the rational design of DACs and understand the structure-activity relationship of SACs with multiple active sites for electrocatalytic energy conversion.</description>

                Lithium&#8208;excess cation&#8208;disordered rocksalt materials are a promising class of transition metal&#8208;based cathodes that exhibit high specific capacity and energy density. The exceptional performance is achieved through participation of anionic redox in addition to cationic redox reactions in the electrochemistry. However, anionic redox reactions accompanied by oxygen evolution, accelerated electrolyte breakdown, and structural evolution lead to voltage hysteresis and low initial Coulombic efficiency. Herein, an Al 2 O 3 layer with varying thickness has been coated onto a high&#8208;entropy disordered rocksalt oxyfluoride cathode through atomic layer deposition to enhance battery performance. The results indicate that the utilization of a uniform Al 2 O 3 coating improves the capacity retention and rate capability of the cathode, with the performance being strongly dependent on the layer thickness. Further investigation into cathode&#8211;electrolyte interfacial reactions reveals that the thin protecting Al 2 O 3 coating can reduce the decomposition of electrolyte on the cathode surface but cannot prevent bulk phase degradation during prolonged cycling. These findings highlight the need for optimized coating design on the disordered rocksalt cathode to improve battery performance.</description>

                Rational design of semiconductor molecule structure is of significant importance for achieving the multifunctional photocatalysis. Herein, three end/bay-substituted perylenediimide (PDI) molecules, including bis(N-carboxymethyl) perylenediimide (H2PDI), 1,7-dibromo-substituted H2PDI (2Br-H2PDI) and 1,6,7,12-tetraether-substituted H2PDI (4CH3CH2O-H2PDI), are synthesized for photocatalytic oxygen evolution (POE) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). One-dimensional H2PDI nanorods, two-dimensional 2Br-H2PDI nanosheets, and zero-dimensional 4CH3CH2O-H2PDI nanoparticles are obtained. Under visible light, 4CH3CH2O-H2PDI as photocatalyst (5.31 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1) exhibits the 1.8-times and 20-times POE rate of 2Br-H2PDI (2.93 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1) and H2PDI (0.26 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1) with AgNO3 as sacrificial agent. Additionally, the POE rate can be further improved to 9.34 mmol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 with the Co2+ doping of 4CH3CH2O-H2PDI. With isopropanol as sacrificial agent, the H2O2 evolution rate of 657.4 &#956;M&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 can be also achieved via photocatalytic ORR with 4CH3CH2O-H2PDI as catalyst, which is &#8764;3 and &#8764;4 times those of 2Br-H2PDI (220.8 &#956;M&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1) and H2PDI (160.0 &#956;M&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1), respectively. Especially, in the O2- or air- saturated aqueous solution without sacrificial agent, the H2O2 rate of 273.1 or 112.7 &#956;M&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 can be also achieved. This work provides a promising way to design the PDI-based multifunctional photocatalysts.</description>

                Stabilizing active sites of non-iridium-based oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial, but remains a big challenge for hydrogen production by acidic water splitting. Here, we report that non-stoichiometric Ti oxides (TiOx) can safeguard the Ru sites through structural-confinement and charge-redistribution, thereby extending the catalyst lifetime in acid by 10 orders of magnitude longer compared to that of the stoichiometric one (Ru/TiO2). By exploiting the redox interaction-engaged strategy, the in situ growth of TiOx on Ti foam and the loading of Ru nanoparticles are realized in one step. The as-synthesized binder-free Ru/TiOx catalyst exhibits low OER overpotentials of 174 and 265 mV at 10 and 500 mA cm-2, respectively. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations confirm that TiOx stabilizes the Ru active center, enabling operation at 10 mA cm-2 for over 37 days. This work opens an avenue of using non-stoichiometric compounds as stable and active materials for energy technologies.</description>

      <title>Constructing Nickel Phosphate Polymorph Heterojunctions by In Situ Cr-Induced Structural Transition for Enhanced Bifunctional Electrochemical Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.4c00479</link>
      <description>Shiyu Lu, Ling Wang, Chunjie Wu, Jun Zhang, Weidong Dou, Tingting Hu, Rong Wang, Ling Yin, Qian Yang, Huan Yi, Meng Jin, ACS sustainable chemistry &amp; engineering. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394014622

                The engineering of polymorph heterojunctions is an essential approach for improving the catalytic kinetics for water electrolysis. Yet, efficient tailoring tactics with component regulation and optimization in the microenvironment are highly desired but a huge challenge. Herein, the design and construction of a kind of nickel phosphide polymorph heterojunction (Ni2P/Ni3P) by an in situ Cr-induced structural transition method is presented, which needs overpotentials of only 108 and 270 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8211;2 for the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) and oxygen evolution reactions (OER), respectively. It exhibits superior bifunctional activity for overall water splitting, which reaches a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 at a cell voltage of 1.56 V. The above current density is 9.1 times higher than that of the Pt/C@NF(&#8722;)//RuO2@NF(+) pair at the same cell voltage. The in situ induced phase transition approach is beneficial for Cr&#8211;Ni2P/Ni3P@NF with strong interfacial coupling and more active sites constructed by the amorphous region, which optimize the d-band center of the electrocatalyst and lead to charge redistribution at the interfaces of Ni2P/Ni3P, regulating the adsorption of H* and OOH* intermediation. This work provides inspiration for optimizing the catalytic activity through the engineering of polymorph heterojunctions by in situ metal-induced structural transition for bifunctional transition metal compound electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Operando Spectroscopic Monitoring of Metal Chalcogenides for Overall Water Splitting: New Views of Active Species and Sites</title>

                Metal&#8208;based chalcogenides exhibit great promise for overall water splitting, yet their intrinsic catalytic reaction mechanisms remain to be fully understood. In this work, we employed operando X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS) and in situ Raman spectroscopy to elucidate the structure&#8208;activity relationships of low&#8208;crystalline cobalt sulfide (L&#8208;CoS) catalysts toward overall water splitting. The operando results for L&#8208;CoS catalyzing the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) demonstrate that the cobalt centers in the bulk are predominantly coordinated by sulfur atoms, which undergo a kinetic structural rearrangement to generate metallic cobalt in S&#8208;Co&#8208;Co&#8208;S moieties as the true catalytic active species. In comparison, during the acidic HER, L&#8208;CoS undergoes local structural optimization of Co centers, and H2 production proceeds with adsorption/desorption of key intermediates atop the Co&#8208;S&#8208;Co configurations. Further operando characterizations highlight the crucial formation of high&#8208;valent Co4+ species in L&#8208;CoS for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the formation of such active species was found to be far more facile than in crystalline Co3O4 and Co&#8208;LDH references. These insights offer a clear picture of the complexity of active species and site formation in different media, and demonstrate how their restructuring influences the catalytic activity.</description>

      <title>A silicon photoanode protected with TiO2/stainless steel bilayer stack for solar seawater splitting</title>

                Abstract Photoelectrochemical seawater splitting is a promising route for direct utilization of solar energy and abundant seawater resources for H 2 production. However, the complex salinity composition in seawater results in intractable challenges for photoelectrodes. This paper describes the fabrication of a bilayer stack consisting of stainless steel and TiO 2 as a cocatalyst and protective layer for Si photoanode. The chromium-incorporated NiFe (oxy)hydroxide converted from stainless steel film serves as a protective cocatalyst for efficient oxygen evolution and retarding the adsorption of corrosive ions from seawater, while the TiO 2 is capable of avoiding the plasma damage of the surface layer of Si photoanode during the sputtering of stainless steel catalysts. By implementing this approach, the TiO 2 layer effectively shields the vulnerable semiconductor photoelectrode from the harsh plasma sputtering conditions in stainless steel coating, preventing surface damages. Finally, the Si photoanode with the bilayer stack inhibits the adsorption of chloride and realizes 167 h stability in chloride-containing alkaline electrolytes. Furthermore, this photoanode also demonstrates stable performance under alkaline natural seawater for over 50 h with an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency of 2.62%.</description>

                Abstract Organic oxidation reactions (OORs) powered by renewable energy sources are gaining importance as a favorable alternative to oxygen evolution reaction, with the promise of reducing the cell potential and enhancing the overall viability of the water electrolysis. This comprehensive review delves into the electrochemical oxidation of diverse organic compounds, including alcohols, aldehydes, amines, and urea, as well as biomass&#8208;derived renewable feedstocks such as hydroxymethylfurfural and glycerol. The key focus centers on the role of nickel (Ni)&#8208;based catalysts for these OORs. The unique redox activity and chemical nature of Ni have been proven instrumental for the sustainable and cost&#8208;effective oxidation of various organic molecules more efficiently and selectively. This review article discusses how strategic choices, such as the selection of foreign metals, intercalating species, vacancies, defects, and a secondary element (e.g. chalcogens and non&#8208;metals), contribute to tuning the electrochemical performances of a Ni&#8208;based (pre)catalyst for OORs. Moreover, this review provides insights into the active species in various reaction environments and further explores reaction mechanisms, to apparent phase changes of the catalyst with the most relevant examples. Finally, the review not only elucidates the limitations of the current approaches but also outlines potential avenues for future advancements in OOR.</description>

                Nanostructure platinum is an effective catalyst that is active toward a broad range of electrochemical processes over a wide range of pH values. However, its high cost and low abundance prevent its widespread use in practical devices. A promising strategy to overcome the limitations of platinum is to combine platinum with less expensive and more abundant transition metals. In this report, we employ an ambient, template-based approach to prepare monodisperse Co nanotubes (NTs) and modify them with platinum via an electroless deposition process. The composition of the resulting Pt modified Co NTs (Pt-Co NTs) can be varied by controlling the Pt ion concentration in the electroless deposition step. The resulting Pt-Co NTs have a hierarchical structure consisting of Pt-Co NTs coated with an amorphous Co-oxide film. The amorphous Co-oxide coating activates the Pt-Co NTs to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) leading to a 9-fold enhancement in the OER activity in an 80% (by mass) Pt-Co NT relative to pure Pt nanowires. The surface oxide coating can be selectively removed by cycling the Pt-Co NTs in an acidic solution. Removing the oxide film activates the Pt-Co NTs toward methanol oxidation (MOR) and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions. In both cases, the trends in MOR and ORR activity follow a volcano-type dependence as a function of composition. The catalyst with the optimum composition of 60% Pt has a 4-fold increase in the specific activity for MOR and maintains a +20 mV shift in the half-wave potential for ORR relative to that of pure Pt nanowires.</description>

      <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Iridium&#8208;Yttrium Alloy Catalyst for Acidic Water Electrolysis</title>

                Abstract Proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis holds great promise in revolutionizing clean energy production by enabling the efficient generation of hydrogen. Nevertheless, a formidable challenge persists in the realm of designing electrocatalysts that are both highly active and acid&#8208;resistant during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), thereby mitigating the substantial kinetic barrier. In this study, the facile synthesis of iridium&#8208;yttrium (IrY) alloy nanocatalysts via a thermal shock method is introduced, which exhibits exceptional activity in the context of acidic water oxidation. Through the strategic incorporation of dispersed Y into the lattice of Ir metal, the IrY catalyst demonstrates a notably low overpotential of 255 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and showcases remarkable catalytic stability in acidic electrolytes, enduring for over 500 h with a high current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 . Through a comprehensive set of in situ characterizations and analytical methods, the formation of a surface Ir&#8208;based oxide layer, induced by deprotonation and electrochemical oxidation is unveiled, which is notably stabilized by the presence of Y dopants. This stabilization of the active site imparts enhanced resistance to over&#8208;oxidation and dissolution, underpinning the exceptional stability of the catalyst. Theoretical calculations suggest that the incorporation of Y into the catalyst structure has a significant impact on enhancing the reactivity of the oxygen intermediate (O*) at adjacent Ir sites, thus lowering the overpotential and promoting OER activity. The alloying approach presents a straightforward method for achieving atomic&#8208;level modifications in catalyst design and can pave the way for the development of more effective and economically viable OER catalysts and beyond.</description>

      <title>Glycerol Electrolyzer with Graphite Anode and Cathode Produces Carbonyl Compounds and Hydrogen: Background Electrocatalysis of a &#8220;Nonparticipating&#8221; Current Collector</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c00917</link>
      <description>Nicolly C. Yonamine, Cinthia R. Zanata, Mois&#233;s Barbosa de Souza, Pablo S. Fern&#225;ndez, Heberton Wender, Cau&#234; A. Martins, ACS applied materials &amp; interfaces. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394564368

                This study unveils a novel role of bare graphite as a catalyst in glycerol electrooxidation and hydrogen evolution reactions, challenging the prevailing notion that current collectors employed in electrolyzers are inert. Half-cell experiments elucidate the feasibility of glycerol oxidation and hydrogen production on bulk graphite electrodes at potentials exceeding 1.7 V. The investigation of varying glycerol concentrations (0.05 to 1.5 mol L-1) highlights a concentration-dependent competition between glycerol electrooxidation and oxygen evolution reactions. Employing an H-type glycerol electrolyzer, polarization curves reveal significant activation polarization attributed to the low electroactivity of the anode. Glycerol electrolysis at different concentrations yields diverse product mixtures, including formate, glycolate, glycerate, and lactate at the anode, with concurrent hydrogen generation at the cathode. The anolyte composition changes with glycerol concentration, resulting in less-oxidized compounds at higher concentrations and more oxidized compounds at lower concentrations. The cell voltage also influences the product formation selectivity, with an increased voltage favoring more oxidized compounds. The glycerol concentration also affects hydrogen production, with lower concentrations yielding higher hydrogen amounts, peaking at 3.5 V for 0.05 mol L-1. This model quantitatively illustrates graphite's contribution to current and product generation in glycerol electrolyzers, emphasizing the significance of background current and products originating from current collectors if in contact with the reactants. These results have an impact on the efficiency of the electrolyzer and raise questions regarding possible extra non-noble "nonparticipating" current collectors that could affect overall performance. This research expands our understanding of electrocatalysis on graphite surfaces with potential applications in optimizing electrolyzer configurations for enhanced efficiency and product selectivity.</description>

                Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted growing attention in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems (e.g., Zn-air batteries, ZABs) owing to their structural tunability, ordered porosity and high specific surface area. In this work, for the first time, the three-dimensional (3D) highly open catalyst (CNFs/CoZn-MOF@COF) possessing hierarchical porous structure and high-density active sites of uniform cobalt (Co) nanoparticles and metal-Nx (M-Nx, M = Co and Zn) is demonstrated, which is fabricated using electrospinning technique in combination with MOF/COF hybridization strategy and direct pyrolysis. Benefiting from the well-designed branch-leaf nanostructures, plentiful and uniform active sites on the MOF/COF-derived carbon frameworks, as well as the synergistic effect of multiple active sites, CNFs/CoZn-MOF@COF catalyst achieves superior electrocatalytic activity and stability towards both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a small potential gap (&#916;E = 0.75 V). In situ Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicate that the CoOOH intermediates are the main active species during OER/ORR. Significantly, both aqueous and all-solid-state rechargeable ZABs assembled with CNFs/CoZn-MOF@COF as the air cathode show high open-circuit potential, outstanding peak power density, large capacity and long cycle life. More impressively, the obtained all-solid-state ZAB also displays superb mechanical flexibility and device stability under different, showcasing great application deformations potential in portable and wearable electronics. This work provides a new insight into the design and exploitation of bifunctional catalysts from MOF/COF hybrid materials for energy storage and conversion devices.</description>

      <title>Interface effect of Fe doped NiSe/Ni3Se2 heterojunction as highly efficient electrocatalysts for overall water splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.150996</link>
      <description>Ruxin Deng, Huiqin Yao, Yixuan Wang, Chaonan Wang, Siqi Zhang, Shaoshi Guo, Yongliang Li, Shulan Ma, Chemical engineering journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394585191

                It matters to design and explore transition metal bifunctional electrocatalysts which can efficiently catalyze overall water splitting. Herein, we report a series of Fe doped NiSe/Ni3Se2 (NiSe/Ni3Se2-Fe-X@t, X is Fe dosage, and t is electrodeposition time) heterojunctions assembled on nickel foam (NF) by one-step electrodeposition. Under alkaline medium (1.0 M KOH), the optimized NiSe/Ni3Se2-Fe-5@5min catalyst shows ultra-low overpotentials of 144 and 200 mV respectively for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to afford the current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, and a small cell voltage of 1.57 V at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 is needed for overall water splitting with extraordinary high stability (&#8805;120 h). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate the heterojunction keeps metallic state, and Fe3+ doping reduces electron density of Ni2+, effectively accelerating Ni &#8594; Fe electron transfer. For HER, Se serves as the active site in the materials with and without Fe, and Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (&#916;GH*) at Se site decreases from 0.149 eV in NiSe/Ni3Se2 to &#8722;0.051 eV in NiSe/Ni3Se2-Fe, whose the much smaller value near to zero indicates significantly enhanced HER activity. For OER, in NiSe/Ni3Se2, Ni serves as active site, while in NiSe/Ni3Se2-Fe, Fe becomes the active site. In the both materials, rate-determining step (RDS) is the formation of *O&#8594;*OOH intermediates and the much lower energy barrier (1.589 eV) after Fe doping contributes to superior OER activity. The calculated TDOS shows that Fe doping increases carrier density and intrinsic conductivity of the catalyst. This work provides important reference for regulating interface effect of electrocatalysts through elemental doping.</description>

                Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have received significant interest for optimizing metal atom utilization and superior catalytic performance in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In this study, we investigate a range of single&#8208;transition metal (STM 1 = Sc 1 , Ti 1 , V 1 , Cr 1 , Mn 1 , Fe 1 , Co 1 , Ni 1 , Cu 1 , Zr 1 , Nb 1 , Mo 1 , Ru 1 , Rh 1 , Pd 1 , Ag 1 , W 1 , Re 1 , Os 1 , Ir 1 , Pt 1 , and Au 1 ) atoms supported on graphyne (GY) surface for HER/OER and ORR using first&#8208;principle calculations. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and phonon dispersion spectra reveal the dynamic and thermal stabilities of the GY surface. The exceptional stability of all supported STM 1 atoms within the H1 cavity of the GY surface exists in an isolated form, facilitating the uniform distribution and proper arrangement of single atoms on GY. In particular, Sc 1 , Co 1 , Fe 1 , and Au 1 /GY demonstrate promising catalytic efficiency in the HER due to idealistic &#916;G H* values via the Volmer&#8208;Heyrovsky pathway. Notably, Sc 1 and Au 1 /GY exhibit superior HER catalytic activity compared to other studied catalysts. Co 1 /GY catalyst exhibits higher selectivity and activity for the OER, with an overpotential (0.46 V) comparable to MoC 2 , IrO 2 , and RuO 2 . Also, Rh 1 and Co 1 /GY SACs exhibited promising electrocatalysts for the ORR, with an overpotential of 0.36 and 0.46 V, respectively. Therefore, Co 1 /GY is a versatile electrocatalyst for metal&#8208;air batteries and water&#8208;splitting. This study further incorporates computational analysis of the kinetic potential energy barriers of Co 1 and Rh 1 in the OER and ORR. A strong correlation is found between the estimated kinetic activation barriers for the thermodynamic outcomes and all proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer steps. We establish a relation for the Gibbs free energy of intermediates to understand the mechanism of SACs supported on STM 1 /GY and introduce a key descriptor. This study highlights GY as a favorable single&#8208;atom support for designing highly active and cost&#8208;effective versatile electrocatalysts for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Effect of multi-interface electron transfer on water splitting and an innovative electrolytic cell for synergistic hydrogen production and degradation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2024.141929</link>
      <description>Xinjing Yuan, Weiyi Hao, Yiran Teng, Hanming Zhang, Cheng Han, X. Zhang, Zhihui Li, Alex O. Ibhadon, Fei Teng, Chemosphere. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394610852

                The cleaning and utilization of industry wastewater are still a big challenge. In this work, we mainly investigate the effect of electron transfer among multi-interfaces on water electrolysis reaction. Typically, the CoS2, Co3S4/CoS2 (designated as CS4-2) and Co3S4/Co9S8/CoS2 (designated as CS4-8-2) samples are prepared on a large scale by one-step molten salt method. It is found that because of the different work functions (designated as WF; WF(Co3S4)=4.48eV, WF(CoS2)=4.41eV, WF(Co9S8)=4.18 eV), the effective heterojunctions at the multi-interfaces of CS4-8-2 sample, which obviously improve interface charge transfer. Thus, the CS4-8-2 sample shows an excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity (134 mV/10 mA cm-2, 40 mV dec-1). The larger double-layer capacitance (Cdl=17.1 mF cm-2) of the CS4-8-2 sample indicates more electrochemical active sites, compared to the CoS2 and CS4-2 samples. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation proves that due to interface polarization under electric field, the multi-interfaces effectively promote electron transfer and regulate electron structure, thus promoting the adsorption of OH- and dissociation of H2O. Moreover, an innovative norfloxacin (NFX) electrolytic cell (EC) is developed through introducing NFX into the electrolyte, in which efficient NFX degradation and hydrogen production are synergistically achieved. To reach 50 mA cm-2, the required cell voltage of NFX-EC has decreased by 35.2%, compared to conventional KOH-EC. After 2h running at 1 V, 25.5% NFX was degraded in the NFX EC. This innovative NFX-EC is highly energy-efficient, which is promising for the synergistic cleaning and utilization of industry wastewater.</description>

                Batrachospermum turfosum Bory is one of the generalists among the few red algae that have adapted to freshwater habitats, occurring in a variety of primarily shaded, nutrient-poor micro-habitats with lotic (running) or lentic (standing) waters. Seasonal variations in water level and canopy cover can expose this sessile alga to widely fluctuating temperatures, solar irradiation and nutrient availability. Here we report on the ecophysiology of B. turfosum collected from an ultra-oligotrophic bog pool in the Austrian Alps. Photosynthesis as a function of photon fluence density (PFD) and temperature was studied by measuring oxygen evolution in combination with chlorophyll fluorescence. In addition, the effects of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) on photosynthetic pigments were analysed using HPLC and spectrophotometric methods, and cellular ultrastructure was studied using transmission electron microscopy. We found that B. turfosum is adapted to low light, with a light compensation point (Ic) and a light saturation point (Ik) of 8.4 and 29.7 &#181;mol photons m&#8211;2 s&#8211;1, respectively, but also tolerates higher PFDs of ~1000 &#181;mol photons m&#8211;2 s&#8211;1, and is capable of net photosynthesis at temperatures between 5&#176;C and 35&#176;C. Exposure to either UV-A or UV-AB for 102 h led to a strong transient drop in effective quantum yield (&#916;F/FM&#8217;), followed by an acclimation to about 70% of initial &#916;F/FM&#8217; values. Ultrastructural changes included the accumulation of plastoglobules and dilated membranes after UVR treatment. Although all photosynthetic pigments strongly decreased upon UVR exposure and no UV-photoprotectants (e.g. mycosporine-like amino acids) could be detected, the alga was capable of recovering &#916;F/FM&#8217; and phycobiliproteins after UVR treatment. In summary, B. turfosum tolerates a wide range of irradiation and temperature regimes, and these traits may be the basis for its successful adaptation to challenging environments.</description>

                Concurrent gaps in the Late Devonian/Mississippian fossil records of insects and tetrapods (i.e. Romer's Gap) have been attributed to physiological suppression by low atmospheric pO2. Here, updated stable isotope inputs inform a reconstruction of Phanerozoic oxygen levels that contradicts the low oxygen hypothesis (and contradicts the purported role of oxygen in the evolution of gigantic insects during the Late Palaeozoic), but reconciles isotope-based calculations with other proxies, like charcoal. Furthermore, statistical analysis demonstrates that the gap between the first Devonian insect and earliest diverse insect assemblages of the Pennsylvanian (Bashkirian Stage) requires no special explanation if insects were neither diverse nor abundant prior to the evolution of wings. Rather than tracking physiological constraint, the fossil record may accurately record the transformative evolutionary impact of insect flight.</description>

                Oxygen plays a central role in cellular metabolism, in both healthy and tumour tissue. The presence and concentration of molecular oxygen in tumours has a substantial effect on both radiotherapy response and tumour evolution, and as a result the oxygen micro-environment is an area of intense research interest. Multicellular tumour spheroids closely mimic real avascular tumours, and in particular they exhibit physiologically relevant heterogeneous oxygen distribution. This property has made them a vital part of in vitro experimentation. For ideal spheroids, their heterogeneous oxygen distributions can be predicted from theory, allowing determination of cellular oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and anoxic extent. However, experimental tumour spheroids often depart markedly from perfect sphericity. There has been little consideration of this reality. To date, the question of how far an ellipsoid can diverge from perfect sphericity before spherical assumptions breakdown remains unanswered. In this work, we derive equations governing oxygen distribution (and more generally, nutrient and drug distribution) in both prolate and oblate tumour ellipsoids, and quantify the theoretical limits of the assumption that the spheroid is a perfect sphere. Results of this analysis yield new methods for quantifying OCR in ellipsoidal spheroids, and how this can be applied to markedly increase experimental throughput and quality.</description>

      <title>Oxidative DNA damage is important to the evolution of antibiotic resistance: evidence of mutation bias and its medicinal implications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.825588</link>
      <description>Min Xiong, Hongyu Zhang, Zhongyi Wang, Liang-Yu Fu, Figshare. None(None)] 2013. https://openalex.org/W4394475811

                Several1 studies have revealed that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by antibacterial stimulation accelerates the evolution of antibiotic resistance, which uncovered new links between oxygen rise and evolution and inspired new strategies to prevent antibiotic resistance. Considering many other mechanisms cause DNA mutations aside from ROS damage, evaluating the significance of oxidative DNA damage in the development of antibiotic resistance is of great interest. In this study, we examined the ratio of G:C &gt; T:A transversion to G:C &gt; A:T transition in drug-resistant Escherichia coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and found that it is significantly higher than the background values. This finding strongly suggests that ROS damage plays a critical role in the development of antibacterial resistance. Considering the long-term co-evolution between host organisms and pathogenic bacteria, we speculate that the hosts may have evolved strategies for combating antibiotic resistance by controlling DNA damage in bacteria. Analysis of the global transcriptional profiles of Staphylococcus aureus treated with berberine (derived from Berberis, a traditional antibacterial medicine) revealed that the transcription of DNA repair enzymes was markedly upregulated, whereas the antioxidant enzymes were significantly downregulated. Thus, we propose that consolidating the DNA repair systems of bacteria may be a viable strategy for preventing antibiotic resistance. 1These authors contributed equally to this work.</description>

                ABSTRACT Domestic sewage treatment experiments were conducted in a pilot installation of biological trickling filters in laboratory, in which the peeled dehydrated fruits of Luffa cyllindrica were used as a support medium for microbiological growth, in order to verify its capacity to remove organic matter, measured in terms of biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The results obtained, when compared to results from similar pilot plant using stones as supporting medium, indicated that Luffa cyllindrica can substitute, under specific conditions, the traditional support media. Although detailed microbiologic studies were not among the objectives of this study, it was also observed that the biofilm found in Luffa cyllindrica was richer in species and in a higher evolutive stage than the biofilm found in the stones. Further studies are recommended.</description>

                We carefully analyze how the abundance of Nitrogen over Oxygen evolves when dependent on metallicity stellar yields with a primary component of N proceeding from AGBs stars are used. We show the results obtained with a chemical evolution models grid, calculated with variable star formation efficiencies, which produce different star formation histories.

      <title>ON THE HYDROGEN EVOLUTION MECHANISM DURING CORROSION OF THE 2198-T8 ALLOY IN CHLORIDE SOLUTION: AN ELECTROCHEMICAL APPROACH</title>

                Corrosion is still one of the most serious and frequent problems in industries. The phenomena involved in the corrosion mechanism of Al-alloys may be explained by formation of galvanic cells between the metal matrix and heterogeneities, such as precipitates, intermetallic phases leading to potential differences and electrochemical reactions. In the cathodic sites, the main reactions are oxygen reduction reaction, in aerated neutral environments, and hydrogen evolution in acid media. This last type of reaction might also occur in neutral solutions inside pits (anodic region). In this study, the mechanism of hydrogen evolution during corrosion of the 2198-T8 Al-Cu-Li alloy exposed in a chloride solution was investigated. The mechanism was related to the presence of T1 phase (Al2CuLi), which is the main strengthening phase in this material. This phase is highly active and, when exposed to corrosive media, leads to severe localized corrosion (SLC). One of the main characteristics related to SLC is hydrogen gas evolution which was confirmed by gel visualization. In this study, the hydrogen evolution mechanism inside the SLC sites was studied by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM).</description>

      <title>Hemoglobin wonders: a fascinating gas transporter dive into molluscs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24960118</link>
      <description>Weifeng Zhang, Yang Zhang, Xizhi Shi, Shi Wang, Yongbo Bao, Figshare. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394492176

                Hemoglobin (Hb) has been identified in at least 14 molluscan taxa so far. Research spanning over 130 years on molluscan Hbs focuses on their genes, protein structures, functions, and evolution. Molluscan Hbs are categorized into single-, two-, and multiple-domain chains, including red blood cell, gill, and extracellular Hbs, based on the number of globin domains and their respective locations. These Hbs exhibit variation in assembly, ranging from monomeric and dimeric to higher-order multimeric forms. Typically, molluscan Hbs display moderately high oxygen affinity, weak cooperativity, and varying pH sensitivity. Hb&#8217;s potential role in antimicrobial pathways could augment the immune defense of bivalves, which may be a complement to their lack of adaptive immunity. The role of Hb as a respiratory protein in bivalves likely originated from the substitution of hemocyanin. Molluscan Hbs demonstrate adaptive evolution in response to environmental changes via various strategies (e.g. increasing Hb types, multimerization, and amino acid residue substitutions at key sites), enhancing or altering functional properties for habitat adaptation. Concurrently, an increase in Hb assembly diversity, coupled with a downward trend in oxygen affinity, is observed during molluscan differentiation and evolution. Hb in Protobranchia, Heteroconchia, and Pteriomorphia bivalves originated from separate ancestors, with Protobranchia inheriting a relative ancient molluscan Hb gene. In bivalves, extracellular Hbs share a common origin, while gill Hbs likely emerged from convergent evolution. In summary, research on molluscan Hbs offers valuable insights into the origins, biological variations, and adaptive evolution of animal Hbs.</description>

      <title>The evolution and desulfurization of sulfur in chemical looping combustion of coal</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13655396</link>
      <description>Ming Luo, Lunzheng Zhou, Chao Wang, Cao Kuang, Figshare. None(None)] 2021. https://openalex.org/W4394511376

                Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is a new technology that has gained great attention due to its advantages in CO2 capture during combustion. Sulfur in coal maybe harmful to the CLC process. The interactions between sulfur and oxygen carrier may reduce the purity of carbon captured, and affect the characteristics of the oxygen carrier. Therefore, the evolution of sulfur in Xinzhou coal and the desulfurization performance in this process were studied by using iron ore as an oxygen carrier. Experimental results showed that the main sulfur-containing component released was SO2, and the fractions of sulfur during the reduction and oxidation periods reached 64.28 and 3.91%, respectively. The addition of desulfurization agent (CaO) could control the release of sulfur and a higher molar ratio of Ca/S resulted in less emission of sulfur-containing gases. The desulfurization efficiency reached 36.61%, 50.72%, and 55.45% when the Ca/S molar ratio was 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 respectively. Considering the investment and operation costs, the recommended molar ratio of Ca/S was 2.0. The formation of CaSO4 was confirmed after reaction, but the stability of CaSO4 and its effect on oxygen carrier over a longer period of time still need to be further studied.</description>

      <title>In Situ Sulfur Isotopic and Thermodynamic Constraints on the Magmatic Evolution and Metallogenesis of the Jinchuan Ni&#8211;Cu Sulfide Deposit, China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.24541069</link>
      <description>Z.-L. Wang, Chao Wang, Yannan Wang, Jin Zhou, Figshare. None(None)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4394526919

                The world-class Jinchuan magmatic Ni&#8211;Cu sulfide deposit in China is one of the world's major suppliers of nickel (Ni) and platinum-group elements (PGEs). The evolution of Jinchuan magma that fed this enormous deposit, which is hosted by an abnormally small intrusion, is highly controversial. The variation in major element compositions of the Jinchuan intrusion suggests that the magma evolution was mainly controlled by olivine, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene crystallization with increasing magma oxygen fugacity from &#916;FMQ -1 to &#916;FMQ +3, consistent with the results simulated by a thermodynamically constrained model, rhyolite-MELTS. During the change in oxygen fugacity, the decrease in sulfur solubility between the liquidus and the temperature of orthopyroxene crystallization calculated by numerical models under ideal conditions dramatically increases from 0.01 wt.% to 0.15 wt.%, contributing to a decrease in magma mass needed to form the deposit (from 2.00 * 105 Mt to 1.52 * 104 Mt, approximately 21 to 1.6 times the estimated mass of the present intrusion). This highlights the vital role of the transition in magma redox state in controlling metallization. The mantle sulfur isotope characteristics (&#948;34S = -2.0 ~ +2.1 &#8240;) of sulfide inclusions in Cr-spinel grains analyzed by NanoSIMS imply that no addition of external sulfur was involved in attaining sulfide saturation during the early stage of Jinchuan magma. Therefore, we conclude that the change in oxygen fugacity and massive magma mass were potentially essential conditions required to generate the world-class Jinchuan deposit, unless contamination by crustal materials, especially external sulfur, was involved.</description>

                Abstract A diagnostic setup for one-dimensionally spatially resolved TALIF detection of ground state oxygen atoms (2p 4 3 P 2,1,0 ) is developed. The goal of this study is to investigate the evolution of temperatures and absolute number densities of oxygen atoms along the effluent of a low-pressure CO 2 microwave discharge in order to gain insights into some of the mechanisms governing the post-discharge regime. The plasma source is operated at conditions of 600 W&#8722;1200 W of absorbed power with flow rates of 74 sccm and 370 sccm pure CO2 at pressures between 1.2 mbar and 5 mbar with specific energy inputs up to 111.9 eV/molecule. These operating conditions exhibit high CO 2 conversions (up to 90 %) at low energy efficiencies (2&#8722;7.4 %), due to direct electron impact dissociation driving the conversion process resulting in splitting of CO 2 into CO and metastable oxygen atoms. The TALIF measurements yield spatially resolved translational temperatures between 1000 K&#8722;1600 K for most operating conditions and axial positions along the effluent. Reference measurements with xenon 6p&#8242; [3/2] 2 are used for absolute number density calibration. The resulting axially resolved number density profiles of ground state atomic oxygen increase along the effluent, even at considerable distances of several centimeters from the active discharge, before they reach a maximum between 5&#215;10 20 m &#8722;3 and 2.2&#215;10 21 m &#8722;3 depending on the condition, and decrease after that. This behavior indicates the potential significance of quenching of metastable oxygen atoms within the post-discharge regime of the investigated CO 2 discharges. The measured spatially resolved number density evolutions are qualitatively consistent with quenching via wall collisions being the dominant deactivation mechanism, underlining the importance of particle-wall interactions.</description>

                We present an analysis of HI, H-alpha, and oxygen abundance data for NGC 3741. This galaxy has a very extended gas disk (~8.8 times the Holmberg radius), and a dark to luminous (i.e. stellar) mass ratio of ~149, which makes it one of the ``darkest'' dwarf irregular galaxies known. However its ratio of baryons (i.e. gas + stellar) mass to dark mass is typical of that in galaxies. Our new high-resolution HI images of the galaxy show evidence for a large scale (purely gaseous) spiral arm and central bar. Despite the gaseous spiral feature and the on-going star formation, we find that the global gas density in NGC 3741 is significantly lower than the Toomre instability criterion. We also find that the star formation rate is consistent with that expected from the observed correlations between HI mass and SFR and the global Kennicutt-Schmidt law respectively. We measure the oxygen abundance to be 12+ log(O/H)=7.66$\pm$0.10, which is consistent with that expected from the metallicity-luminosity relation, despite its extreme gas mass ratio. We also examine the issue of chemical evolution of NGC 3741 in the context of closed-box model of chemical evolution. The effective oxygen yield of NGC 3741 is consistent with recent model estimates of closed-box yields, provided one assumes that the gas has been efficiently mixed all the way to edge of the HI disk (i.e. &gt;8 times the optical radius). This seems a priori unlikely. On the other hand, using a sample of galaxies with both interferometric HI maps and chemical abundance measurements, we find that the effective yield is anti-correlated with the total dynamical mass, as expected in leaky box models (slightly abridged).</description>

                Full evolutionary models have been built to follow the phases of asymptotic giant branch evolution with mass loss for metal mass fractions from Z=0.0002 to Z=0.004. For the first time, we find that temperatures close to or even larger than 10^8 K are achieved at low Z; the full CNO cycle operates at the base of the envelope, the Oxygen abundance for the most metal-poor models of 4 and 5 solar masses is drastically reduced, and sodium and aluminum production by by proton capture on neon and magnesium can occur. These results may be relevant for the evolution of primordial massive globular clusters: we suggest that the low-mass stars may have been polluted at the surface by accretion from the gas that was lost from the evolving intermediate-mass stars at early ages.</description>

                We report results of a spectrophotometric study of SBS 1150+599A and discuss the nature of this object based upon our data. Our study shows that SBS 1150+599A is most probably a planetary nebula located in the Galactic halo and not a cataclysmic variable as originally proposed by the authors of the Second Byurakan Survey from low resolution spectroscopy. We have further elaborated on the properties of SBS 1150+599A (now becoming PN G135.9+55.9) with tools used for planetary nebula analysis. Our photoionization models show that, in order to match the observational constraints, the oxygen abundance in the nebula is probably extremely low, around 1/500 solar, which is one order of magnitude lower than the most oxygen-poor planetary nebulae known so far. This finding has strong implications on our understanding of the formation of planetary nebulae and of the evolution of the Galactic halo.</description>

                HII galaxies are clumpy and their gas kinematics can be mapped to show the global turbulent motions and the effect of massive star evolution. The distribution of their physical conditions is homogeneous and oxygen abundance is uniform. The presence of nebular HeII 4868 line seems to be higher in a low abundance galaxy, implying a harder ionization power probably due to stars in low metallicity. Innovative methods of data cube analysis, namely PCA tomography (nicknamed 4D), seem promising in revealing additional information not detected with the standard methods. I review some of our own recent work on the 3D spectroscopy of HII galaxies.</description>

                ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Since February 2020, data on the clinical features of patients infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and their clinical evolution have been gathered and intensively discussed, especially in countries with dramatic dissemination of this disease. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical features of Brazilian patients with SARS-CoV-2 and analyze its local epidemiological features. DESIGN AND SETTING: Observational retrospective study conducted using data from an official electronic platform for recording confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases. METHODS: We extracted data from patients based in the state of Pernambuco who were registered on the platform of the Center for Strategic Health Surveillance Information, between February 26 and May 25, 2020. Clinical signs/symptoms, case evolution over time, distribution of confirmed, recovered and fatal cases and relationship between age group and gender were assessed. RESULTS: We included 28,854 patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (56.13% females), of median age 44.18 years. SARS-CoV-2 infection was most frequent among adults aged 30-39 years. Among cases that progressed to death, the most frequent age range was 70-79 years. Overall, the mortality rate in the cohort was 8.06%; recovery rate, 30.7%; and hospital admission rate (up to the end of follow-up), 17.3%. The average length of time between symptom onset and death was 10.3 days. The most commonly reported symptoms were coughing (42.39%), fever (38.03%) and dyspnea/respiratory distress with oxygen saturation &lt; 95% (30.98%). CONCLUSION: Coughing, fever and dyspnea/respiratory distress with oxygen saturation &lt; 95% were the commonest symptoms. The case-fatality rate was 8.06% and the hospitalization rate, 17.3%.</description>

                The effects of some oxide intermediate layers on the electrochemical behavior and characteristics of oxide-coated titanium electrodes Ti/PbO2, Ti/Co3O4 and Ti/CuCO2O4 have been investigated.The results showed that the intermediate layers of Co3O4, PdOx, SnO2 and Sb2O3 could markedly decrease the interface resistance of the electrodes. The electrode Ti/PbO2 with intermediate layer of (Sb2O3+PdOx) and the electrode Ti/Co3O4 with intermediate layer of (SnO2+PdOx) showed nearly the same reaction activity for anodic evolution of Cl2 as the industrial electrode consisting of Ti/RuO2+TiO2, but higher oxygen overpotentials than the latter.</description>

                Catalase is one of the most abundant enzymes on Earth. It decomposes hydrogen peroxide, thus protecting cells from dangerous reactive oxygen species. The catalase-encoding gene is conspicuously absent from the genome of most representatives of the family Trypanosomatidae. Here, we expressed this protein from the Leishmania mexicana &#914;-TUBULIN locus using a novel bicistronic expression system, which relies on the 2A peptide of Teschovirus A. We demonstrated that catalase-expressing parasites are severely compromised in their ability to develop in insects, to be transmitted and to infect mice, and to cause clinical manifestation in their mammalian host. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that the presence of catalase is not compatible with the dixenous life cycle of Leishmania, resulting in loss of this gene from the genome during the evolution of these parasites.</description>

                The origin and the chemical and isotopic evolution of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in groundwater of the Okavango Delta in semi-arid Botswana were investigated using DIC and major ion concentrations and stable oxygen, hydrogen and carbon isotopes (&#948;D, &#948;18O and &#948;13CDIC). The &#948;D and &#948;18O indicated that groundwater was recharged by evaporated river water and unevaporated rain. The river water and shallow (&lt;10 m) groundwater are Ca&#8211;Na&#8211;HCO3 type and the deep (&#8805;10 m) groundwater is Na&#8211;K&#8211;HCO3 to HCO3&#8211;Cl&#8211;SO4 to Cl&#8211;SO4&#8211;HCO3. Compared to river water, the mean DIC concentrations were 2 times higher in shallow groundwater, 7 times higher in deep groundwater and 24 times higher in island groundwater. The &#948;13CDIC indicate that DIC production in groundwater is from organic matter oxidation and in island groundwater from organic matter oxidation and dissolution of sodium carbonate salts. The ionic and isotopic evolution of the groundwater relative to evaporated river water indicates two independent pools of DIC.</description>

                Anophelines are vectors of malaria, the deadliest disease worldwide transmitted by mosquitoes. The availability of genomic data from various Anopheles species allowed evolutionary comparisons of the immune response genes in search of alternative vector control of the malarial parasites. Now, with the Anopheles aquasalis genome, it was possible to obtain more information about the evolution of the immune response genes. Anopheles aquasalis has 278 immune genes in 24 families or groups. Comparatively, the American anophelines possess fewer genes than Anopheles gambiae s. s., the most dangerous African vector. The most remarkable differences were found in the pathogen recognition and modulation families like FREPs, CLIP and C-type-lectins. Even so, genes related to the modulation of the expression of effectors in response to pathogens and gene families that control the production of reactive oxygen species were more conserved. Overall, the results show a variable pattern of evolution in the immune response genes in the anopheline species. Environmental factors, such as exposure to different pathogens and differences in the microbiota composition, could shape the expression of this group of genes. The results presented here will contribute to a better knowledge of the Neotropical vector and open opportunities for malaria control in the endemic-affected areas of the New World.</description>

                Abstract We present optical observations and analysis of the bright type Iax supernova SN 2020udy hosted by NGC 0812. The evolution of the light curve of SN 2020udy is similar to that of other bright type Iax SNe. Analytical modeling of the quasi-bolometric light curves of SN 2020udy suggests that 0.08 &#177; 0.01 M &#8857; of 56 Ni would have been synthesized during the explosion. The spectral features of SN 2020udy are similar to those of the bright members of type Iax class, showing a weak Si ii line. The late-time spectral sequence is mostly dominated by iron group elements with broad emission lines. Abundance tomography modeling of the spectral time series of SN 2020udy using TARDIS indicates stratification in the outer ejecta; however, to confirm this, spectral modeling at a very early phase is required. After maximum light, uniform mixing of chemical elements is sufficient to explain the spectral evolution. Unlike in the case of normal type Ia SNe, the photospheric approximation remains robust until +100 days, requiring an additional continuum source. Overall, the observational features of SN 2020udy are consistent with the deflagration of a carbon&#8211;oxygen white dwarf.</description>

      <title>Films Formed on Carbon Steel in Sweet Environments - A Review</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8848121</link>
      <description>Igor Alexandre Fioravante, Ronaldo Spezia Nunes, Helo&#237;sa Andr&#233;a Acciari, Eduardo Norberto Codaro, Figshare. None(None)] 2019. https://openalex.org/W4394184375

                Corrosion of carbon steel pipelines in sweet environments has been extensively researched on oil and natural gas exploration and production in order to obtain efficient corrosion mitigation methods. Although the consequences of corrosion are known, the cause and mechanism by which a certain phenomenon occurs are still not well understood. Sweet corrosion is mainly caused by the carbon dioxide dissolved in the water contained in the oil. It can manifest itself in different ways and one of which is the formation of a scale on the inner walls of the pipelines, which determines the evolution of corrosion process. This paper discusses the effects of partial pressure of carbon dioxide, dissolved hydrogen sulfide, dissolved oxygen and water chemistry on scale formation. Particular attention is paid to the nature and stability of the aqueous species formed during the corrosion process, as well as the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects lead to the scale formation on the carbon steel surface. The main objective is to enhance the understanding of the conditions of formation and precipitation of siderite and mackinawite and their effects on corrosion processes involving low carbon steels.</description>

                The bright, saturated iridescent colours of feathers are commonly produced by single and multi-layers of nanostructured melanin granules (melanosomes), air and keratin matrices, surrounded by an outer keratin cortex of varying thicknesses. The role of the keratin cortex in colour production remains unclear, despite its potential to act as a thin film or absorbing layer. We use electron microscopy, optical simulations and oxygen plasma-mediated experimental cortex removal to show that differences in keratin cortex thickness play a significant role in producing colours. The results indicate that keratin cortex thickness determines the position of the major reflectance peak (hue) from nanostructured melanosomes of common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) feathers. Specifically, the common pheasant has appropriate keratin cortex thickness to produce blue and green structural colours. This finding identifies a general principle of structural colour production and sheds light on the processes that shaped the evolution of brilliant iridescent colours in the common pheasant.</description>

      <title>Contributions to a More Realistic Characterization of Corrosion Processes on Cut Edges of Coated Metals Using Scanning Microelectrochemical Techniques, Illustrated by the Case of ZnAlMg-Galvanized Steel with Different Coating Densities</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17071679</link>
      <description>M.F. Bolsanello, A Garcia, Luciana Xavier da Cruz Lima, Bruno Kneipel Neto, Jetson Lemos Ferreira, Jesualdo Luiz Rossi, Isolda Costa, Ricardo M. Souto, Javier Izquierdo, Materials. 17(7)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394576028

                Corrosion processes at cut edges of galvanized steels proceed as highly localized electrochemical reactions between the exposed bulk steel matrix and the protective thin metallic coating of a more electrochemically active material. Scanning microelectrochemical techniques can thus provide the spatially resolved information needed to assess the corrosion initiation and propagation phenomena, yet most methods scan cut edge sections as embedded in insulating resin to achieve a flat surface for scanning purposes. In this work, the galvanized coatings on both sides of the material were concomitantly exposed to simulated acid rain while characterizing the cut edge response using SECM and SVET techniques, thereby maintaining the coupled effects through the exposure of the whole system as rather realistic operation conditions. The cut edges were shown to strongly promote oxygen consumption and subsequent alkalization to pH 10&#8211;11 over the iron, while diffusion phenomena eventually yielded the complete depletion of oxygen and pH neutralization of the nearby electrolyte. In addition, the cathodic activation of the exposed iron was intensified with a thinner coating despite the lower presence of sacrificial anode, and preferential sites of the attack in the corners revealed highly localized acidification below pH 4, which sustained hydrogen evolution at spots of the steel-coating interface.</description>

      <title>Chemodynamical gas flow cycles and their influence on the chemical evolution of dwarf irregular galaxies</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.astro-ph/0302383</link>
      <description>Andreas Rieschick, G. Hensler, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2003. https://openalex.org/W4394636222

                Here we investigate an exemplary chemodynamical evolutionary simulation of a dwarf irregular galaxy. By means of this model we demonstrate the existence of three gas mixing cycles: 1) An inner "local cycle" mixing the metals produced in stars locally, and 2) an outer "galactic cycle" on which hot gas is driven out of the galaxy by multiple supernovae type II and mixes on a short timescale with the available cold gas. 3) Only a small fraction of the metals leaves the galactic gravitational field and follows the "global cycle" with the intergalactic matter. The large-scale mixing results in a temporary depletion of supernova ejected metals. We will discuss this "delayed recycling" and its influence on the chemical evolution, especially on the nitrogen over oxygen ratio which is increased temporarily. These results presented her are also relevant for less sophisticated analytical approaches and chemical evolutionary models of galaxies which have to parameterize the metal loss through outflow.</description>

                Recent advances in genomics and metabolomics have made the study of specialized metabolism far more tractable than it was previously. Here we evaluate specialized metabolite pathways of Capsicum spp. (peppers), focusing mainly on carotenoids, flavonoids, and capsaicinoids as examples of classes of secondary metabolites. To place these data in the context of the evolution of metabolic pathways, we compare the extent of genomic and chemical diversity in several species of the nightshades (Solanaceae), the family to which pepper belongs. We further discuss the genetic mechanisms known to underly metabolic diversity prior to carrying out a detailed genomic study of the enzymes active in the pathways influencing fruit color and pungency. Using large-scale comparative analyses across 25 sequenced plant genomes, we identify orthologs of structural metabolic genes and discuss the data in terms of variation of gene family size and its impact on the diversity of secondary metabolites.

                Alignments used for the positive selection tests performed in the work "Molecular Evolution of the Glutathione S-transferase family in the Bemisia tabaci species complex ".Abstract:The glutathione S-transferase (GST) family plays an important role in the adaptation of herbivorous insects to new host plants and other environmental constrains. The family codes for enzymes that neutralize reactive oxygen species and phytotoxins through the conjugation of reduced glutathione. Here, we studied the molecular evolution of the GST family in Bemisia tabaci, a complex of &gt;35 sibling species, differing in their geographic and host ranges. We tested if some enzymes evolved different functionality, by comparing their sequences in six species, representing five of the six major genetic clades in the complex. Comparisons of the nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratios detected positive selection events in 11 codons of 5 cytosolic GSTs. Ten of them are located in the periphery of the GST dimer, suggesting a putative involvement in interactions with other proteins. Modeling the tertiary structure of orthologous enzymes, identified additional 19 mutations in 9 GSTs, likely affecting the enzymes&#8217; functionality. Most of the mutation events were found in the environmentally responsive classes Delta and Sigma, indicating a slightly different delta/sigma tool box in each species. At a broader genomic perspective, our analyses indicated a significant expansion of the Delta GST class in B. tabaci and a general association between the diet breadth of hemipteran species and their total number of GST genes. We raise the possibility that at least some of the identified changes improve the fitness of the B. tabaci species carrying them, leading to their better adaptation to specific environments.</description>

                The Pliocene&#8211;Quaternary volcanics in NE Turkey are mainly hornblende&#8211;phyric trachyandesites having a narrow range of SiO2 from 61.88 to 63.00 wt.% and exhibiting adakitic signatures with their Na2O (3.67&#8211;4.27 wt.%), Al2O3 (16.19&#8211;16.80 wt.%), Y (14.1&#8211;16.5 ppm) contents and K2O/Na2O (0.87&#8211;1.12), Sr/Y (44.24&#8211;54.90), and La/Yb (36.80&#8211;43.88) ratios. Plagioclases as the main mineral phases show a wide range of compositions, and weak normal and reverse zoning. Hornblendes are generally edenite and pargasite (Mg#: 0.39&#8211;0.74). Clinopyroxenes are augite (Mg#: 0.58&#8211;0.76). Biotites have Mg# ranging from 0.45 to 0.66. The textural and compositional variations indicate disequilibrium crystallization possibly arising from magma mixing. The U&#8211;Pb zircon dating of the adakitic volcanics yielded 3.4&#8211;1.9 Ma. The studied rocks display moderate light rare earth element /heavy rare earth element ratios and enrichment in the lithophile element and depletion in high field strength element, implying that the parental magmas were derived from mantle sources previously enriched by slab-derived fluids and/or subducted sediments. The crystallization temperature and pressure estimations based on the clinopyroxene thermobarometry range from 1144 to 1186&#176;C and from 3.92 to 7.97 kbar, respectively. Hornblende thermobarometry, oxygen fugacity, and hygrometer calculations yielded results as 908&#8211;993&#176;C at a pressure of 2.87&#8211;5.22 kbar, water content of 4.4&#8211;8.4 wt.%, and relative oxygen fugacity (&#916;NNO log units) of &#8722;0.6 to 0.9, respectively. Biotite thermobarometry suggests relatively higher oxygen fugacity conditions (10&#8211;13.33 to 10&#8211;17.60) at temperatures of 676&#8211;819&#176;C and at pressures from 1.15 to 1.76 kbar. In the light of the obtained data and modelling, it can be concluded that the magmas of the adakitic volcanics were derived from enriched mantle source through relatively higher partial melting and experienced magma mixing with melts at the crustal level. Additionally, the fractional crystallization and assimilation-fractional crystallization processes may have played an important role during the evolution of the studied volcanics.</description>

      <title>Carbon nanotube-encapsulated Co/Co3Fe7 heterojunctions as a highly-efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc-air batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.04.025</link>
      <description>Xiaofeng Liu, Sichen Huo, Xia Xu, Xinyu Wang, Wanyu Zhang, Yanjie Chen, Cheng Wang, JiahaoXie, Xueting Liu, Haiyang Chang, Jinlong Zou, Journal of colloid and interface science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394008663

                In oxygen electrocatalysis, how to rationally design low-cost catalysts with reasonable structure and long-term stability is a crucial issue. Here, an in-situ growth strategy is used to construct a shaped structure encapsulating a uniformly-dispersed Co/Co3Fe7 heterojunction in nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (Co/Co3Fe7@NCNTs). Hollow CoFe layered-double-hydroxide prisms act as sacrifices for in-situ growth of Co/Co3Fe7 nanoparticles, which also catalyze the growth of bamboo-like NCNTs. Tubular structure not only accelerates the charge transfer through the interactions between Co and Co3Fe7, but also limits the aggregation of the particles, thereby promoting the 4e- oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER) kinetics and stabilizing the bifunctional activity. Co/Co3Fe7@NCNTs-800 (pyrolyzed at 800 &#176;C) shows exceptional ORR activity (half-wave potential of 0.89 V) and methanol tolerance. Meanwhile, Co/Co3Fe7@NCNTs-800 shows a small OER overpotential of 280 mV, which increases by only 9 mV after 1000 cyclic voltammetry (CV) cycles. The outstanding bifunctionality (potential gap of 0.62 V) is ascribed to the electronic structure modulation at the Co/Co3Fe7 heterointerface. Notably, it also has a high performance as an air&#8211;cathode for rechargeable zinc-air battery, showing high power density (165 mW cm&#8722;2) and specific capacity (770.5 m Ah kg&#8722;1). This work provides a new reference for promoting the development of alloy catalysts with heterogeneous interfaces.</description>

      <title>Modelling sulfate concentrations in the global ocean through Phanerozoic time</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs2023-184</link>
      <description>Alexander J. Krause, Graham Shields, Robert J. Newton, Benjamin J. W. Mills, Journal of the Geological Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394577217

                Understanding the long-term variance of seawater sulfate concentrations ([SO 4 2- ] sw ) is critical to understanding the dynamic relationship between the sulfur, carbon, calcium, and oxygen cycles, and their influence on Earth's habitability. Here, we explore how [SO 4 2- ] sw has changed throughout the Phanerozoic, and its impact on other elemental cycles. We do this by utilising the biogeochemical box model GEOCARBSULFOR. The model suggests that [SO 4 2- ] sw rose throughout the Paleozoic, declined during the Mesozoic, and then rose once more in the Cenozoic, generally matching geochemical proxies. Atmospheric oxygen mirrors [SO 4 2- ] sw changes during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic, but intriguingly, decouples during the Cenozoic. We further explored controls on [SO 4 2- ] sw by modifying the modelled gypsum fluxes via the incorporation of evaporite data from the geological record. We find that forcing gypsum burial with the observed evaporite deposition data causes the model to better match proxy records at some times, but worsens predictions at others. Finally, we investigate model reliance on a prescribed record of marine calcium concentrations, finding that it is a dominant control on modelled Phanerozoic [SO 4 2- ] sw , and that removing this control seriously degrades model predictions. We conclude that no model can yet simulate a reasonable evolution of both the calcium and sulfur cycles.

      <title>A Subsolar Metallicity on the Ultra-short-period Planet HIP 65Ab</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/ad3071</link>

                Abstract Studying and understanding the physical and chemical processes that govern hot Jupiters gives us insights on the formation of these giant planets. Having a constraint on the molecular composition of their atmosphere can help us pinpoint their evolution timeline. Namely, the metal enrichment and carbon-to-oxygen ratio can give us information about where in the protoplanetary disk a giant planet may have accreted its envelope, and, subsequently, indicate if it went through migration. Here we present the first analysis of the atmosphere of the hot Jupiter HIP 65Ab. Using near-infrared high-resolution observations from the IGRINS spectrograph, we detect H 2 O and CO absorption in the dayside atmosphere of HIP 65Ab. Using a high-resolution retrieval framework, we find a CO abundance of log(CO) =   &#8722;   3.85   &#8722; 0.36   + 0.33    , which is slightly underabundant with expectation from solar composition models. We also recover a low-water abundance of log(H 2 O) = &#8722;4.42 &#177; 0.18, depleted by 1 order of magnitude relative to a solar-like composition. Upper limits on the abundance of all other relevant major carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules are also obtained. Overall, our results are consistent with a sub-stellar metallicity but slightly elevated C/O. Such a composition may indicate that HIP 65Ab accreted its envelope from beyond the water snowline and underwent a disk-free migration to its current location. Alternatively, some of the oxygen on HIP 65Ab could be condensed out of the atmosphere, in which case the observed gas-phase abundances would not reflect the true bulk envelope composition.</description>

      <title>Marine redox dynamics and biotic response to the mid-Silurian Ireviken Extinction Event in a mid-shelf setting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1144/jgs2023-155</link>
      <description>Y. Wang, Paul B. Wignall, Yijun Xiong, David K. Loydell, Jeff Peakall, Jaco H. Baas, Benjamin J. W. Mills, Simon W. Poulton, Journal of the Geological Society. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394571488

                The early Silurian Llandovery&#8211;Wenlock boundary interval was marked by significant marine perturbations and biotic turnover, culminating in the Ireviken Extinction Event (IEE) and the Early Sheinwoodian Carbon Isotope Excursion (ESCIE). Here, we apply multiple independent redox proxies to the early Wenlock Buttington section, which was deposited in a mid-shelf location in the Welsh Basin, UK. To account for regional geochemical variability in marine sediments due to factors such as sediment provenance, we first define oxic baseline values for the Welsh basin, utilizing deeper water, well-oxygenated intervals of late Llandovery age. Our approach documents unstable, oscillating redox conditions on the mid shelf at Buttington. We suggest that these dynamic redox fluctuations are likely to relate to changes in the position of the chemocline or a migrating oxygen minimum zone. Benthic biota such as trilobites, brachiopods, bivalves and gastropods appear to have been relatively unaffected by fluctuating oxic-ferruginous conditions, but were more severely impacted by the development of euxinia, highlighting the inhibiting role of toxic sulfides. By contrast, the redox perturbations appear to have placed extreme stress on graptolites, causing many extinction losses regardless of the specific development of euxinia.

      <title>Sex in protists: A new perspective on the reproduction mechanisms of trypanosomatids</title>

      <description>Ver&#244;nica Santana da Silva, Carlos Renato Machado, Figshare. None(None)] 2022. https://openalex.org/W4394283458

                Abstract The Protist kingdom individuals are the most ancestral representatives of eukaryotes. They have inhabited Earth since ancient times and are currently found in the most diverse environments presenting a great heterogeneity of life forms. The unicellular and multicellular algae, photosynthetic and heterotrophic organisms, as well as free-living and pathogenic protozoa represents the protist group. The evolution of sex is directly associated with the origin of eukaryotes being protists the earliest protagonists of sexual reproduction on earth. In eukaryotes, the recombination through genetic exchange is a ubiquitous mechanism that can be stimulated by DNA damage. Scientific evidences support the hypothesis that reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced DNA damage can promote sexual recombination in eukaryotes which might have been a decisive factor for the origin of sex. The fact that some recombination enzymes also participate in meiotic sex in modern eukaryotes reinforces the idea that sexual reproduction emerged as consequence of specific mechanisms to cope with mutations and alterations in genetic material. In this review we will discuss about origin of sex and different strategies of evolve sexual reproduction in some protists such that cause human diseases like malaria, toxoplasmosis, sleeping sickness, Chagas disease, and leishmaniasis.</description>

                BACKGROUND Metformin (MET) is a hypoglycemic drug used for the treatment of diabetes, despite interference in host immunity against microorganisms. Cutaneous infection caused by pathogens such as Leishmania braziliensis (Lb), the agent responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Brazil, represents an interesting model in which to evaluate the effects associated with MET. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the modulatory effect of MET in Lb infection. MATERIAL AND METHODS Experimental study of Lb infection and MET treatment in BALB/c mice and Raw 264.7 macrophages. FINDINGS MET treatment interfered with lesion kinetics, increased parasite load and reduced macrophage proliferation. Low concentrations of MET in Lb culture allow for the maintenance of stationary parasite growth phase. Lb-infected cells treated with MET exhibited increased parasite load. While both MET and Lb infection alone promoted the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced levels of ROS were seen in MET-treated Lb-infected macrophages. MAIN CONCLUSION Experimental treatment with MET interfered with the kinetics of cutaneous ulceration, increased Lb parasite load, altered ROS production and modulated cellular proliferation. Our experimental results indicate that MET interfere with the evolution of CL.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the high-temperature corrosion resistance of HVOF-sprayed NiCoCrAlY coating in marine environment by Pt modification and pre-oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmst.2024.02.079</link>

                To prolong the service lifetime of hot-section components used in marine environment at elevated temperatures, it is crucial to explore and develop high-temperature corrosion-resistant coatings. High-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) sprayed NiCoCrAlY, Pt-modified NiCoCrAlY and pre-oxidized Pt-modified NiCoCrAlY coatings were prepared and investigated. This study is concerned with the performance of three coatings in a simulated marine environment based on the phase composition of corrosion products and microstructure evolution of coating samples combined with first-principles density functional theory. The results show that the NiCoCrAlY coating was subject to accelerated corrosion and extensive aluminum depletion, leading to premature coating failure. The high-temperature corrosion resistance of Pt-modified NiCoCrAlY coating was found to be better than that of NiCoCrAlY coating. In contrast, the pre-oxidized Pt-modified NiCoCrAlY coating offered long-lasting protection and exhibited the best corrosion resistance, which is attributed to the positive synergistic effect between Pt modification and pre-oxidation.</description>

      <title>Hypervalent Iodine(III) Mediated Halogen Bonded Supramolecular Chiral System with Cholesteryl Naphthalimides</title>

                Halogen bonding acknowledged as a noteworthy weak interaction, has gained growing recognition in the field of supramolecular chemistry. In this study, we selected structurally rigid diaryliodonium ions (I(III)) with two biaxial &#963;-holes as halogen-bond donors, to bind with three chiral acceptor molecules bearing cholesteryl and naphthalimides with distinct geometries. The abundant carbonyl oxygen atoms in side-arm substituents function as multiple acceptors for halogen bonding. The self-aggregation of chiral acceptor molecules demonstrates adaptiveness to solvent media, evidenced by the inversion of the Cotton effect and the morphological evolution from spherical to rod-like nanoarchitectures in different solvent systems. The distinct geometries of the acceptor molecules conferred various binding modes with I(III). The introduction of I(III) as a halogen-bond donor regulates the aggregation of the donors, achieving amplification of chiroptical signals and inheriting solvent responsiveness from the self-aggregated assembly. This study successfully utilized rational structural design and multimodal control strategies to achieve regulation of supramolecular chirality.</description>

      <title>Nanosizing and Al-Mg alloying effects of boron particles on combustion characteristics and energy release of B/JP-10 suspension fuel</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2024.123134</link>

                Adding boron particles into JP-10 to prepare B/JP-10 suspension fuel can effectively improve the energy density and combustion heat of JP-10-based aviation fuel. However, the energy release of boron in B/JP-10 fuel has many challenges to overcome. In this study, micron-sized boron (Micro-B), nano-sized boron (Nano-B) and aluminum-magnesium-boron (AlMgB) alloy particles were added into JP-10 fuel to prepare suspension fuels. The effects of boron particle nanosizing and alloying on the combustion characteristics and energy release of B/JP-10 fuel are experimentally evaluated. These characteristics were achieved by investigating the combustion stage, flame structure, emission spectra, droplet evolution, micro-explosion, flame temperature, and morphology of residues. The results show that compared with Micro-B/JP-10, Nano-B/JP-10 droplets show better micro-explosion characteristics, shorter burning time, and better boron-oxygen reaction rate during the combustion process. The results of combustion flame temperature and emission spectrum show that Nano-B/JP-10 droplets burn better, which shows that nano-boron particles have better energy release characteristics. AlMgB/JP-10 droplets reduce the reaction temperature of boron and enhance the combustion of boron through the interphase interaction of Al and Mg into B. Compared with Micro-B/JP-10, it shows a higher combustion flame temperature and emission spectrum, the boron-oxygen reaction rate is greatly improved, and react to form flaky crystals on the agglomerate surface, making it difficult for the shell to close, resulting in weak micro-explosion but effective energy release.</description>

      <title>Annealing Effects on the Structural and Optical Properties of ZnO Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6273374</link>

                ZnO nanostructures were synthesized by a proteic sol-gel method, using zinc nitrate hexahydrate and gelatin as precursors. Size and shape evolution of ZnO nanostructures were achieved by annealing temperature in the range 250-1000 &#186;C. The crystalline structure, morphology and optical properties of the ZnO nanoparticles were characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Raman Spectroscopy (RS), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and room temperature Photoluminescence (PL). The result of structural characterization shows the formation of platelets and nanorods in the micro-scale and ZnO nanostructures with high quality hexagonal wurtzite crystal. Sharp peaks in RS after annealing temperature, related to wurtzite structure, were observed corroborating with XRD and TEM measurements. Room temperature PL spectra showed two contribution bands which peaked at ~380 nm, originating from the recombination of free excitons, and ~520 nm corresponding to the impurities and structural defects, like oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitial. The effects of annealing temperature in the structural and optical properties are detailed and the results compared among the experimental techniques. The high quality of the samples obtained by an alternative organic precursor method opens a low-cost route to technological applications of zinc oxide.</description>

                ABSTRACT Studies carried out over short time intervals assist in understanding the biogeochemical processes occurring relatively fast in natural waters. High frequency monitoring shows a greater variability in the water quality during and immediately after heavy rainfall events. This paper presents an assessment of the surface water quality parameters in the Atlantic Forest biome, caused by heavy rainfall events. The work was developed in two fluviometric sections of the Concordia River watershed, located in the state of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. The spatial distribution of land use shows the predominance of Atlantic Forest in fluviometric section 1 (FS1) and pasture, forestry, agriculture, and Atlantic Forest in fluviometric section 2 (FS2). In each selected heavy rainfall event, the evolution rainfall height, the water level, and physicochemical parameters of water were analyzed. In all events, the water quality changed due to the heavy rainfall. After the events, an increase in water level and turbidity in both fluviometric sections were detected. In addition, the ammonium ion concentration increased in the river, and the pH value and nitrate concentration decreased. The electrical conductivity presented different behavior in each section. The dissolved oxygen concentration increased in 19 of 27 events. The principal component (PC1) correlated with the turbidity in FS1, and it correlated with level, turbidity, and pH in FS2.</description>

      <title>Sedimentary and drainage evolution of the Condamine Valley Transition Zone (eastern Australia)</title>

                The basal succession of the Condamine Valley, which overlays the boundary between the Surat and Clarence-Moreton basins (eastern Australia), contains a clay-rich horizon &#8216;the Transition Zone&#8217; that marks a pronounced unconformity between the Jurassic Walloon Coal Measures and the Quaternary Condamine Alluvium. This paper provides insights into the tectonic and drainage evolution of the Condamine Valley through integrated analysis of U&#8211;Pb ages of detrital zircon from three samples (494 concordant analyses), stable oxygen isotope analysis on eight authigenic clay samples, X-ray fluorescence of primary and trace elements, and hyperspectral mineral analysis from two drill cores (Lone Pine 17 and Daandine 164). The Transition Zone is interpreted to consist of both weathered Jurassic sediments and Cenozoic clay deposits. Two sequential cycles of erosion, deposition and pedogenesis, related to geomorphological and climatic conditions are recognised. Distinctive oxygen isotope signatures of the two weathering fronts demonstrated an initial Early Cretaceous phase (&#948;18O = 11.9&#8211;15.7&#8240; VSMOW) associated with laterisation and possible uplift, followed by Paleogene (&#948;18O = 16.4&#8211;17.3&#8240; VSMOW) silcretisation of reworked Jurassic sediments. Detrital zircon geochronology yielded Jurassic maximum constraints for the age of deposition of three samples that are indistinguishable within error, the oldest of which (163 &#177; 8 Ma from the lateritic profile) corresponds to the age of the underlying Walloon Coal Measures. The two overlaying samples from a silcrete profile and granular alluvium yielded overlapping yet younger ages of 150 &#177; 6 Ma and 156 &#177; 9 Ma, respectively. Vitrinite reflectance used as a proxy for the thermal condition of the coal strata enabled an estimated 2&#8211;3 km of burial and subsequent (likely Early Cretaceous) uplift. Geochemical insights from the Condamine Valley correspond to broad-scale climatic and tectonic conditions, suggesting that &#8216;transition zone equivalents&#8217; and corresponding groundwater dynamics may occur in similar sedimentary settings throughout eastern Australia.</description>

      <title>Petrogenesis of the U-rich Permian Akkulen syenite intrusion, Tien Shan, Kyrgyzstan: insights into its magmatic evolution and geodynamic setting</title>

                Permian alkaline granitoids are widely distributed throughout the Tien Shan Orogen and adjacent region of the southern Central Asian Orogenic Belt. However, their petrogenesis and related tectonic setting remain equivocal. A detailed mineralogical, U-Pb zircon dating, in situ elemental and Sr-Nd-Hf isotopic studies of the uranium-rich Akkulen syenite intrusion in the Northern Tien Shan of Kyrgyzstan were undertaken to better understand its magmatic processes and geodynamic evolution. Four independent oxygen barometers have shown that the oxygen fugacity of the Akkulen syenitic magma evolved from initial low fO2 (2 (&gt;NNO +1) during magma ascent and cooling; Apatite geochemical characteristics also indicate that the magma is relatively high F (2.9&#8211;5.1 wt.%), with low Cl (0.053&#8211;0.13 wt.%) and anhydrous (&lt;4 wt %) contents. According to whole-rock geochemical data, the syenite samples have abnormally high U (38.5&#8211;57.1 ppm) and Th (96.2&#8211;137 ppm) concentrations, we suggest that high F content and moderate oxygen fugacity are beneficial for uranium enrichment. Zircon grains from a syenite sample yielded a weighted 206Pb/238U age of 283.5 &#177; 2.6 Ma. The intrusion has an A-type granite affinity with high alkali (Na2O + K2O) contents and Fe/(Fe+Mg) ratios, high LREE/HREE (~5), and low Sr, Ba, and Eu contents. They have negative &#949;Nd(t) (&#8722;5.2 to &#8722;3.6) values with Mesoproterozoic two-stage model ages (T DM2 = 1.35&#8211;1.47 Ga), and variable &#949;Hf(t) values (&#8722;4.6 to +2.4) with Mesoproterozoic two-stage model ages (T DM2 = 1. 2&#8211;1.59 Ga), which suggest these rock derivations from the relatively old crustal with minor contribution from juvenile crustal melts. In comparison with regional available dataset, we propose that the alkaline Permian granitoids in Kyrgyz Northern Tien Shan may have been originated from large-scale partial melting of Mesoproterozoic metamorphic basement with minor juvenile crustal material in a post-extensional setting. In contrast, the Early Permian granitoid magmatism in the Tarim Craton may have been caused by the partial melting of Neoproterozoic basement rocks associated with Permian mantle plume activities.</description>

                ABSTRACT High levels of eutrophication in coastal lagoons due to human activity have been documented worldwide. Among the main impacts observed are anoxia, hypoxia, toxic algal blooms, fish kills, loss of biodiversity and loss of bathing. This study aimed to evaluate the evolution of the trophic state of Lagoa da Concei&#231;&#227;o, a subtropical lagoon located in an urbanized watershed on the island of Santa Catarina - Brazil. Spatio temporal patterns of stratification and eutrophication were investigated to understand the main biochemical changes over time. The water quality data were obtained from field campaigns supplemented with literature of the last 15 years. The vertical structure of the water column and the trophic state were evaluated by the stratification index and the TRIX index, respectively. Analyses of variance were performed in order to identify possible temporal variations in vertical stratification and trophic level. Eutrophication effects on biogeochemical cycles were verified through a multi-dimensional cluster analysis (MDS) and correlations between variables related to physical, chemical and biological processes were verified by principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that the water column is homogeneous in all regions except in the central region of the lagoon, and the highest ammonia concentrations and lowest dissolved oxygen concentrations with periods of anoxia are observed in bottom waters. The study looked at the high trophic level of the lagoon and its inability to process the biogeochemical changes imposed by urban development.</description>

      <title>Thermally Induced Structure and Functionality Evolution of a Pt&#8208;based Lean NOx Trap Catalyst</title>

                Applying a NOx trap catalyst to effectively remove NOx contaminants from the oxygen&#8208;rich exhaust is still very challenging, due to the lack of use guidance based on deactivation mechanisms. The temperature&#8208;dependent Pt sintering rate constant was described using Pt dispersion determined by pulse CO chemisorption. It was found that 700&#8208;850 &#186;C was the determining temperature regions for the significant Pt sintering, according to the sintering kinetics and the evolution of active Pt&#948;+ sites. The weak basicity plays a critical role in trapping NOx at low&#8208;temperature (&#8804; 300 &#186;C), and the NOx trap efficiency decreases because of the loss of catalytic activity and medium basicity caused by forming BaAl2O4 phase. The reduction of NOx towards N2 on the Pt crystallites smaller than 18 nm is structure sensitive and decreases with losing the reducibility of catalysts. The security for long&#8208;time use of a NOx trap catalyst should be exposed to the exhaust gas within 750 &#186;C, and effectively removing NOx contaminants requires it to be worked in the 350&#8208;500 &#186;C regions. These findings can guide engineers and applied chemists how to efficiently use a NOx trap catalyst in the automotive exhaust purification system.</description>

      <title>Supplementary Material for: Scoping Review: Integration of the Major Mechanisms Underlying the Regulation of Arteriolar Tone</title>

                Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Arteriolar tone regulation plays a critical role in maintaining appropriate organ blood flow and perfusion distribution, which is vital for vascular and overall health. Impaired arteriolar function has been associated with the evolution and manifestation of various CVD conditions, emphasizing the importance of understanding arteriolar reactivity. This scoping review aims to explore the interplay between five major regulators of arteriolar tone - metabolism (adenosine), adrenergic control (norepinephrine), myogenic activation (intravascular pressure), perivascular oxygen tension, and intraluminal flow rates. Specifically, the aim was to address how arteriolar reactivity changes in the presence of other vasoactive stimuli and by what mechanisms. The review focused on animal studies that investigated the impact of combining two or more of these stimuli on arteriolar diameter. 848 articles were identified through MEDLINE and EMBASE database searches, and 38 studies were included in the final review. The results indicate that arteriolar reactivity is influenced by multiple factors, including competitive processes, structural limitations, and indirect interactions among stimuli. Additionally, the review identified a lack of research involving female animal models and limited insight into the interaction of molecular signaling pathways, which represent gaps in the literature.</description>

                We have studied the abundance of oxygen in the IGM by analyzing OVI, CIV, SiIV, and HI pixel optical depths derived from a set of high-quality VLT and Keck spectra of 17 QSOs at 2.1 &lt; z &lt; 3.6. Comparing OVI and CIV optical depth ratios to those in realistic, synthetic spectra drawn from a hydrodynamical simulation and comparing to existing constraints on [Si/C] places strong constraints on the ultraviolet background (UVB) model using weak priors on allowed values of [Si/O]: for example, a quasar-only background yields [Si/O] ~ 1.4, highly inconsistent with the [Si/O] ~ 0 expected from nucleosynthetic yields and with observations of metal-poor stars. Assuming a fiducial quasar+galaxy UVB consistent with these constraints yields a primary result that [O/C] = 0.66 +/- 0.06 +/- 0.2; this result pertains to gas with overdensity &gt;~ 0.2. Consistent results are obtained by similarly comparing OVI to HI or OVI to SiIV optical depth ratios to simulation values, and also by directly ionization-correcting OVI optical depths as function of HI optical depths into [O/H] as a function of density. Subdividing the sample reveals no evidence for evolution, but low- and high-density samples are inconsistent, suggesting either density-dependence of [O/C] or -- more likely -- prevalence of collisionally-ionized gas at high density.</description>

      <title>Regulation of Ni/Co Ratio and Gas Transport in High&#8208;Order Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Air Electrodes for Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202403493</link>

                Abstract The delicate design of efficient air electrodes is conducive to improving the reaction kinetics and operational durability of protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) at intermediate&#8208;low temperatures. Here, a series of high&#8208;order Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite electrodes are developed via the regulation of Ni/Co ratio and porosity for efficient charge/gas transfer. As verified by structural analysis and electrochemical characterizations, the electrode with a composition of Pr 4 Ni 1.8 Co 1.2 O 10&#8208;&#948; (PNCO64) shows the most matchable thermal expansion behavior with electrolytes, and highest electrical conductivity, and best catalytic activity toward oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. The Ni/Co ratio of 6:4 can induce the formation of an optimized amount of Pr 6 O 11 in PNCO64, which is likely the pivotal source of the improved catalytic activity. When implemented on PCECs, the PNCO64 electrodes with the addition of 5% graphite pore&#8208;former achieve a remarkable peak power density (1.18 W cm &#8722;2 ) and a high current density of 2.08 A cm &#8722;2 at 1.3 V at 600 &#176;C. Excellent durability in fuel cell mode (&#8776;85 h) and electrolysis mode (&#8776;92 h) is also accomplished in PCECs at 600 &#176;C.</description>

      <title>Paleoenvironmental evolution and organic matter accumulation of the lower Cambrian Maidiping marine black shales in the intracratonic basin, western margin of Sichuan Basin, South China</title>

      <description>Guodong Xia, Yuehao Ye, Shugen Liu, Heng Wang, Song Jin, Weidong Sun, Bo Ran, Kun Jiang, Guoliang Xie, Bin Deng, Zhiwu Li, Yun Zhang, Figshare. None(None)] 2023. https://openalex.org/W4394228278

                The Late Ediacaran to Early Cambrian marked a pivotal phase in paleoenvironmental and tectonic shifts. The Sichuan Basin, on the Yangtze platform&#8217;s western edge, developed the Mianyang-Changning intracratonic sag due to Xingkai taphrogenesis. The Maidiping Formation&#8217;s black shales, the initial fine-grained clastic deposits from the Early Cambrian, span the Sichuan Basin&#8217;s western margin. The influence of the intracratonic sag on organic matter accumulation and paleo-marine environment evolution remains unclear. Comprehensive petrological and geochemical analyses on the Qingping section revealed three distinct members within the Maidiping Formation: black shales and silicified dolomite with shales in a restricted basin (lower member), deep-water black shales (middle member), and phosphoritic turbidite sandstone with siliceous phosphorites (upper member). The lower member&#8217;s organic accumulation arose from restricted ocean circulation, leading to stratified waters and reduced oxygen at depth. The middle member&#8217;s organic build-up was influenced by enhanced intracratonic sag connectivity with the open ocean, sea-level rise, and increased productivity. The submarine hydrothermal activity might have induced anoxic conditions. The upper member saw a decline in organic matter due to phosphoritic debris and oxygenation. The Maidiping Formation augments the Lower Cambrian source rock, vital for oil and gas exploration in the Sichuan Basin&#8217;s western margin.</description>

                Abstract Reversible proton&#8208;conducting solid oxide cells (R&#8208;PSOCs) are considered to be one of the most promising devices for efficient power generation and hydrogen production. However, the requirement of high catalytic activity for fast oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) and durability under high steam concentration of air electrode materials remains the major challenge for the practical application of R&#8208;PSOCs. Here, a series of cobalt&#8208;free Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite of Nd 0.8 Sr 1.2 Ni 1&#8208;x Fe x O 4&#177;&#948; are reported with mixed conductivity for enhanced ORR/OER kinetics. The R&#8208;PSOCs with an optimal Nd 0.8 Sr 1.2 Ni 0.7 Fe 0.3 O 4&#177;&#948; air electrode show a high peak power density of 1.28 W cm &#8722;2 in the fuel cell mode and a promising current density of 3.24 A cm &#8722;2 at 1.3 V in the electrolysis cell mode at 700 &#176;C. In addition, the R&#8208;PSOCs show favorable stability under the fuel cell, electrolysis, and reversible modes for hundreds of hours. This work demonstrates that the Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper materials can be utilized as suitable air electrodes for R&#8208;PSOCs.</description>

                Abstract The effect of La&#8208;deficiency and Ce/Sr&#8208;substitution in the benchmark LaCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 has been investigated for the decomposition of N 2 O between 500 and 900 &#176;C. Real inlet gas composition and space velocity reveal that La&#8208;deficiency and Ce/Sr&#8208;substitution can improve the thermal stability of catalyst, while La 1&#8208; x Sr x Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 with x &#8805;0.1 was highlighted as a promising formula due to the strongest resistance to deactivation and suppressed undesired NO x decomposition at high space velocity. This phenomenon is mainly ascribed to the incorporation of Sr 2+ into the perovskite lattice during the reaction consequently stabilizing the Co 3+ species and creating the oxygen vacancies in La 1&#8208; x Sr x CoO 3&#8208;&#948; . On the contrary, the loss of activity on Ce&#8208;substituted LaCo 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3 has been preferentially related to the cobalt exsolution to extra framework of perovskite making the catalytic cycle with Co 3+ unfavorable. All these bulk and surface changes are accompanied with opposite evolution of apparent activation energy and pre&#8208;exponential factor which can be discussed based on a redox mechanism.</description>

      <title>Reinforcing oxygen reduction reaction and accelerating charge migration kinetics on In4SnS8 by polypyrrole for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.04.016</link>

                Solar light-driven hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production through the two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) from the earth-abundant O2 and water is a potential alternative to the energy-consuming anthraquinone oxidation process, although the activity of the common photocatalysts is still insufficient to satisfy the industrial demands. Poor accessibility of O2 to surface/interface and fast carrier recombination is the limiting-factor for catalytic systems. Herein, we develop a nanohybrid photocatalysts by introducing 1D conducting polymer of polypyrrole (PPy) nanotube on In4SnS8 to promote H2O2 evolution under visible light, obtaining up to 254.8 &#956;M in 2 h, which is 2.4- and 13-fold larger than that of individual In4SnS8 and PPy. The detailed characterizations of hybrid structure, O2 adsorption behaviors, charge carrier dynamics over PPy/In4SnS8 in conjunction with computational calculations corroborate that the modification of PPy could enlarge the amount of O2 adsorption amount, expedite the cycle of O2 adsorption/desorption and accelerate the transportation of electrons from In4SnS8 to the interface, eventually speeding up H2O2 photoproduction via indirect 2e- ORR pathway.

                Abstract Objective: To clinically and epidemiologically characterize patients receiving home care in the city of Maceio, in the state of Alagoas, Brazil. Methods: An observational, cross-sectional study with a sample of 859 patients was carried out, based on data obtained from the medical records of institutions that provide a home care service. A total of 445 patients were from a public service and 414 were from a private service. Descriptive analysis was used for the demographic, clinical and functional variables. Results: Most patients were elderly, female, bedridden, fed orally and had neurological disorders, with stroke the most common diagnosis. Regarding patient evolution, 16.8% of individuals were discharged from home care, 45% of patients died and 24% were hospitalized during the period of home care. A total of 9% of patients had a tracheostomy, 84.7% breathed room air, 9.3% used oxygen, 4% used noninvasive mechanical ventilation, 1.9% used invasive mechanical ventilation, and 24.9% of patients had pressure ulcers. All patients received medical visits, with 693 receiving nursing care, 767 undergoing physiotherapy, 233 receiving speech therapy sessions, 665 patients accompanied by a nutritionist, 64 undergoing occupational therapy sessions and 98 receiving counseling. Conclusion: It was noted that some results differed from literature and between the public and private service. This divergence could be related to the specific epidemiology of each region and the type of insurance paying for care (Unified Health Service or Private).</description>

      <title>Evolution, characterization, and expression profile of Egl-9 family hypoxia-inducible factor (&lt;i&gt;egln&lt;/i&gt;) in rainbow trout (&lt;i&gt;Oncorhynchus mykiss&lt;/i&gt;) under hypoxia stress</title>

                Egl-9 family hypoxia-inducible factor (egln), an oxygen-sensing enzyme family, has been thoroughly characterized in mammals and certain fishes, but there is few research on its involvement in reproductive development and hypoxic stress in rainbow trout. In this study, we investigated the gene structure, physicochemical properties, and evolutionary connection of the egln gene family. The expression profile of egln gene family and their regulatory mechanism were explored using bioinformatics analysis and hypoxia treatment experiments. Five egln genes were discovered in the rainbow trout genome in this investigation (egln1, egln2a, egln2b, egln3a, and egln3b). Domain prediction revealed that all egln proteins have p4hc conserved domains, and phylogenetic analysis revealed that rainbow trout egln2 and egln3 were closely related to Atlantic salmon. The results of real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed that egln genes were generally expressed in all detected tissues, and higher in the ovary, testis, and brain in normoxia. Under hypoxia, the expression level of eglns was significantly down-regulated in most tissues except the liver. Our research contributes to future research on the functional properties of egln genes, as well as the evolution of teleosts and the impact of hypoxia on biological immunity.</description>

      <title>Generation of environmentally persistent free radicals on photoaged tire wear particles and their neurotoxic effects on neurotransmission in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2024.108640</link>
      <description>Yulun Gu, Yongqi Jiang, Xiaoxia Chen, Liangzhong Li, Haibo Chen, Jinyu Chen, Chen Wang, Jun Yu, Chao Chen, Hui Li, Environment international. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4394567032

                Tire wear particles (TWP) are a prevalent form of microplastics (MPs) extensively distributed in the environment, raising concerns about their environmental behaviors and risks. However, knowledge regarding the properties and toxicity of these particles at environmentally relevant concentrations, specifically regarding the role of environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) generated during TWP photoaging, remains limited. In this study, the evolution of EPFRs on TWP under different photoaging times and their adverse effects on Caenorhabditis elegans were systematically investigated. The photoaging process primarily resulted in the formation of EPFRs and reactive oxygen species (O2&#8226;&#8722;, &#8901;OH, and 1O2), altering the physicochemical properties of TWP. The exposure of nematodes to 100 &#956;g/L of TWP-50 (TWP with a photoaging time of 50 d) led to a significant decrease in locomotory behaviors (e.g., head thrashes, body bends, and wavelength) and neurotransmitter contents (e.g., dopamine, glutamate, and serotonin). Similarly, the expression of neurotransmission-related genes was reduced in nematodes exposed to TWP-50. Furthermore, the addition of free-radical inhibitors significantly suppressed TWP-induced neurotoxicity. Notably, correlation analysis revealed a significantly negative correlation between EPFRs levels and the locomotory behaviors and neurotransmitter contents of nematodes. Thus, it was concluded that EPFRs on photoaged TWP induce neurotoxicity by affecting neurotransmission. These findings elucidate the toxicity effects and mechanisms of EPFRs, emphasizing the importance of considering their contributions when evaluating the environmental risks associated with TWP.</description>

                Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health concern characterised by a progressive alteration of renal function, and obesity, diabetes and hypertension are major risk factors. Oxidative stress is commonly observed in CKD patients resulting from an imbalance between overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impairment of defense mechanisms. Therefore, strategies that alleviate oxidative stress may have major clinical implications towards improving vascular health and reducing the burden of CKD. Also, CKD worsens the quality of life of patients, therefore it is fundamental to implement new therapeutic strategies aimed at slowing down its progression. This interventional study is a randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial consisting at the daily oral supplementation with high dosing grape seed flour (GSF &#8776; 1 g/kg) for experimental (n = 30) or starch for placebo (n = 10) to patients suffering from CKD of various stages and aetiologies. Blood and urine samples were collected at baseline and after a six-month-long supplementation period to follow up the disease evolution through the determination of renal function biomarkers, as well as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and blood parameters. Supplementation with high dosing GSF was safe and well tolerated during the entire period of investigation. GSF clearly improved the main renal function biomarkers as GFR, proteinuria, blood pressure, oxidative stress and inflammation as well as the overall patient welfare as indicated by several blood parameters. Most importantly high dosing GSF specifically halted and even reversed the progression of diabetic nephropathy a major cause of CKD and end stage renal disease.</description>

      <title>A review of research on adakites</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11439150</link>
      <description>Lingyu Zhang, Shichao Li, Qing Zhao, Figshare. None(None)] 2019. https://openalex.org/W4394274898

                Taking account of their importance in inferring continental geodynamic processes, adakites have been the subject of considerable research since their discovery and identification. With their high Sr and low Y and HREE concentrations and high Sr/Y and La/Yb ratios, adakites were originally considered to be the product of slab melting in subduction zone settings. Adakites were therefore interpreted to yield information pertaining to magmatic processes, the mineralization of economic deposits, and crustal evolution along convergent margins. However, as more &#8216;adakites&#8217; are reported, the lack of standardization of the term is becoming more apparent. The uncertainty of the nomenclature mainly evolves from the breadth of lithological definitions and the diversity of proposed adakite genesis. This paper reviews progress on the definition of adakites and related concepts, and formally introduces widely used classifications and genetic models. Using an adakite database compiled from published articles, 979 samples termed as adakites in the database were screened using a number of geochemical definitions, and 356 fully conforming rocks (termed reference adakite samples) were obtained. By comparing and analysing the characteristics of the reference adakite samples, we recognize that: (1) the screened reference adakites have enlightened the origin of anomalous samples; (2) the domain range of the reference adakites in compositional diagrams mainly supports the hypothesis that high-SiO2 adakites are consistent with the original definition of adakites; and (3) numerous genetic models can explain the formation of compositionally heterogeneous adakites, and therefore the use of the term adakite requires caution in their geodynamic interpretation. The reference adakite samples are also used to discuss the applicability of existing geochemical diagrams. There have also been developments in our understanding of the relationship between adakites and porphyry-type Cu&#8211;Mo&#8211;Au mineralization, which can be quantitatively assessed by constraining the relative oxygen fugacity.</description>

                Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles in defence response of host plants versus pathogens. While generation and detoxification of ROS is well understood, how varied ability of different isolates of pathogens to overcome host ROS, or ROS contribution to a particular isolate's pathogenicity, remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that transcriptional regulation of ROS pathway, in combination with the insulin pathway, increases the pathogenicity of invasive species Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. The results showed a positive correlation between fecundity and pathogenicity of different nematode isolates. The virulent isolates from introduced populations in Japan, China and Europe had significantly higher fecundity than native avirulent isolates from the USA. Increased expression of Mn-SOD and reduced expression of catalase/GPX-5 and H2O2 accumulation during invasion are associated with virulent strains. Additional H2O2 could improve fecundity of B. xylophilus. Furthermore, depletion of Mn-SOD decreased fecundity and virulence of B. xylophilus, while insulin pathway is significantly affected. Thus, we propose that destructive pathogenicity of B. xylophilus to pines is partly due to upregulated fecundity modulated by insulin pathway in association with ROS pathway and further enhanced by H2O2 oxidative stress. These findings provide a better understanding of pathogenic mechanisms in plant&#8211;pathogen interactions and adaptive evolution of invasive species.This article is part of the theme issue &#8216;Biotic signalling sheds light on smart pest management&#8217;.</description>

                Abstract In this work, Pt 3 Fe nanoparticles (Pt 3 Fe NPs) with the ordered internal structure and Pt&#8208;rich shells surrounded by plenty of Fe single atoms (Fe SAs) as active species (Pt 3 Fe NP&#8208;in&#8208;Fe SA) loaded in the carbon materials are successfully fabricated, which are abbreviated as island&#8208;in&#8208;sea structured (IISS) Pt 3 Fe NP&#8208;in&#8208;Fe SA catalysts. Moreover, the synergistic effect of O&#8208;bridging between Pt 3 Fe NPs and Fe SAs, and the ordered internal structured Pt 3 Fe NPs with Pt&#8208;rich shells of an optimal thickness contributes to the achievement of the local acidic environments on the surfaces of Pt 3 Fe NPs in the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the enhancement of the desorption rate of *OH intermediate in the acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). In addition, the electronic interactions between Pt 3 Fe NPs and dispersed Fe SAs cannot only provide efficient electrons transfer, but also prevent the aggregation and dissolution of Pt 3 Fe NPs. Furthermore, the overpotential and the half wave potential of the as&#8208;prepared IISS Pt 3 Fe NP&#8208;in&#8208;Fe SA catalysts toward the alkaline HER and toward the acidic ORR are 8 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and 0.933 V, respectively, which is 29 lower and 86 mV higher than those (37 mV and 0.847 V) of commercial Pt/C catalysts.</description>

      <title>RNA-seq transcriptome of Staphylococcus aureus at stationary phase in Tryptic Soy Broth</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11340191</link>

                A commensal of the human body, Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus is also an opportunistic pathogen of increasing concern across the world. Able to grow without oxygen, the bacterium is capable of infecting many types of wounds on different parts of the body. But, chief amongst concerns about the bacterium is its increasing ability to resist a variety of antibiotics. Understanding the physiology of S. aureus provides one avenue for the discovery of drugs able to combat this pathogen, and more fundamentally, provides a glimpse into the biology of this bacterium that has a shared evolution history with humans. In particular, understanding how S. aureus has transformed from a commensal into an opportunistic pathogen with the acquisition of new genetic and physiological repertoire is a fascinating question yet to be fully answered. This contribution hopes to provide some fundamental information that could illuminate the questions posted above. Chiefly, the RNA-seq transcriptome of S. aureus at stationary phase (16 hrs) in Tryptic Soy Broth at 37 oC (ArrayExpress accession number: E-GEOD-77242) was analysed by an in-house MATLAB algorithm to yield a transcriptional picture that revealed the importance of DNA and chromosomal maintenance to the cell. Specifically, an ensemble of 0.5 million reads indicated that highly expressed genes were: chromosomal replication initiation protein, lipase, delta-hemolysin, quinol oxidase subunit I, clumping factor, accessory gene regulator protein A, accessory gene regulator protein C, DNA polymerase III subunit beta, quinol oxidase AA3 subunit II, and elongation factor Tu. Overall, understanding the stationary phase gene expression pattern of S. aureus could potentially point us to therapeutic strategies to combat this increasing important human pathogen, that, in some cases, have resisted treatment with our front-line antibiotics. </description>

                The interpretation of trace element/calcium ratios of speleothems as indicators of local hydroclimatic variability in the vicinity of caves has led to controversy in reconstructing the evolution of moisture conditions in arid central Asia (ACA) during the Holocene. Here we present records of Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, Ba/Ca, and U/Ca from precisely dated stalagmites from Baluk cave in Xinjiang (northwest China), spanning the past 9370 years. The co-variations of the trace element ratios, together with the slopes of the regression lines of the corresponding logarithmically transformed data, suggest that they are dominated by prior calcite precipitation (PCP) and thus can be used as reliable proxies of changes in moisture/precipitation. The trace element ratios are relatively high during ~9 to 5 ka and lower from 5 ka to the present, indicating a trend of increasing mid&#8211;late Holocene moisture in ACA. The long-term trend of variation of the trace element ratios is correlative with two other records of speleothem trace element ratios from caves in ACA: Kesang cave (western Xinjiang) and Ton cave (Uzbekistan). This spatial coherency of the trend of inferred moisture conditions from three caves that are separated by hundreds of kilometers demonstrates that speleothem trace element ratios are indicative of large spatial scale rather than local hydroclimatic variability in ACA during the Holocene. However, the long-term trend of variation of the trace element ratios is the inverse of the corresponding oxygen isotope (&#948;18O) records from the same cave sites, which implies that Holocene speleothem &#948;18O records do not represent changes in the precipitation amount in ACA; rather, they most likely reflect moisture sources and related water vapor transport controlled by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation (NHSI). Our findings provide new evidence for a &#8216;westerlies-dominated climatic regime&#8217;, which influenced hydroclimatic changes in ACA during the Holocene.</description>

                Abstract. Aerosol particles play crucial roles in both climate dynamics and human health. However, there remains a significant gap in our understanding of aerosol composition and evolution, particularly regarding secondary organic aerosols (SOA), and their interaction with clouds in high-altitude background areas in China. Here we conducted real-time measurements of submicron aerosols (PM1) using aerosol mass spectrometers at a forested mountain site (1128 m a.s.l.) in southeastern China in November 2022. Our results revealed that organic aerosol (OA) constituted a substantial portion of PM1 (41.1 %), with the OA being primarily of secondary origin, as evidenced by a high oxygen-to-carbon (O/C) ratio (0.85&#8211;0.96). Positive matrix factorization resolved two distinct SOA factors: less oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA) and more oxidized OOA (MO-OOA). Interestingly, MO-OOA was scavenged efficiently during cloud events, while cloud evaporation contributed significantly to LO-OOA. The ratio of OA/&#916;CO increased with a decrease in the O/C ratio, suggesting that OA remaining in cloud droplets generally maintained a moderate oxidation state. Furthermore, our results indicated a higher contribution of organic nitrates to total nitrate during cloudy periods (27 %) compared to evaporative periods (3 %). Notably, a substantial contribution of nitrate in PM1 (20.9 %) was observed, particularly during high PM periods, implying that nitrate formed in polluted areas interacted with clouds and significantly impacted the regional background site. Overall, our study underscores the importance of understanding the dynamics of secondary organic aerosols and the impacts of cloud processing in regional mountainous areas in southeastern China.</description>

      <title>Petrogenesis and geochronology of the bronze fox porphyry Cu-Au deposit: Implications for the geodynamic evolution of the Gurvansaykhan Island arc, southern Mongolia</title>

                A diversity of Devonian-Carboniferous volcanic arcs and granitoid intrusions are exposed in the Gurvansaykhan arc terrane of southern Mongolia. Several giant porphyry Cu-Au-Mo deposits are associated with intrusions within these arcs. The Bronze Fox deposit located in the central part of the Gurvansaykhan arc terrane is an example of a potentially economic deposit with affinity of adakite-like granitoid porphyry (i.e. 428 Mt grading 0.26% to 0.30% Cu for up to 2,437 Mlb of copper and 0.84 Moz gold). The genesis and magmatic evolution of the causative rocks of the Bronze Fox porphyry Cu-Au hosting rocks are poorly understood, and different models are still under debate. In the current study, we present new field observations and petrographic, geochemical, and geochronological data to describe the magmatic evolution and geodynamic settings. In addition, the mineral chemical data are reported from some selected rock-forming minerals to identify crystallization conditions of the studied rock suites by employing geothermobarometric methods. Zircon chronological data reveal the emplaced age at 331 &#177; 3.4 Ma for the volcanic lava, followed by mineralized granodiorite and monzodiorite with intruded ages of 326.5 &#177; 3.4 Ma and 326.5 &#177; 2.7 Ma, respectively. The studied intrusive and extrusive rocks are high-K-alkaline and metaluminous, characterized by high Mg#. They are enriched in large ion lithophile elements (Sr and Ba) and light rare earth elements (LREEs) and depleted in high field strength elements (Nb, Ta, and Ti) and heavy rare earth elements (HREEs). The highly mineralized granodiorite intrusion yields zircon crystallization temperatures ranging from 631.8 to 779.4&#176;C, and the monzodiorite intrusion, which contains relatively low-grade mineralization, has a wider range (599.0 to 803.4&#176;C). The formation pressures of the former range from 0.5 to 0.2 kbar, which is equivalent to a depth of 1.38 km based on amphibole geochemical calculations. The results of mineral chemistry indicate that the unmineralized diorite unit was formed under medium pressure (~50 MPa) and high temperature (~750&#176;C) at depths of 6.8 to 7.5 km. Similarities in geochemistry and petrographic features suggest that the igneous rocks probably originated from a similar magma source (i.e. from the melting of ancient oceanic crust and sediments) but experienced different degrees of partial melting or mixing with lower juvenile crust melts. The estimated fO2 values obtained by amphibole chemistry in the granodiorite and quartz diorite of the Bronze Fox copper-gold mineralization range from &#8722;13.0 to &#8722;11.8 and &#8722;13.2 to &#8722;10.8, respectively, confirming that these igneous rocks probably crystallized under relatively oxidized conditions above the nickel-nickel oxide (NNO) buffer. Such results yield an overall range between NNO +2.6 and NNO +1.4, which are characterized by high oxygen fugacities and high Ce4+/Ce3+ ratios that reflect oxidizing magma, thus indicating quite promising potential for porphyry Cu-Au mineralization in the region. Based on the findings of this work, we suggest a new tectonic model of arc magmatism that is a response to the subduction of the Paleo-Asian Ocean in the early Carboniferous period.</description>

                Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) generates ATP, but OXPHOS also supports biosynthesis during proliferation. In contrast, the role of OXPHOS during quiescence, beyond ATP production, is not well understood. Using mouse models of inducible OXPHOS deficiency in all cell types or specifically in the vascular endothelium that negligibly relies on OXPHOS-derived ATP, we show that selectively during quiescence OXPHOS provides oxidative stress resistance by supporting macroautophagy/autophagy. Mechanistically, OXPHOS constitutively generates low levels of endogenous ROS that induce autophagy via attenuation of ATG4B activity, which provides protection from ROS insult. Physiologically, the OXPHOS-autophagy system (i) protects healthy tissue from toxicity of ROS-based anticancer therapy, and (ii) provides ROS resistance in the endothelium, ameliorating systemic LPS-induced inflammation as well as inflammatory bowel disease. Hence, cells acquired mitochondria during evolution to profit from oxidative metabolism, but also built in an autophagy-based ROS-induced protective mechanism to guard against oxidative stress associated with OXPHOS function during quiescence.

      <title>Supplementary Material for: Pulmonary Gas Exchange Improves over the First Year in Preterm Infants with and without Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14038724</link>

                Background: Right shift of the peripheral oxyhaemoglobin saturation (SpO2) versus inspired oxygen pressure (PIO2) curve is a sensitive marker of pulmonary gas exchange. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the impact of prematurity and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) on gas exchange and right-to-left shunt in the neonatal period, and its evolution over the first year of life. Method: We assessed shift and shunt in extremely preterm (EP) and very preterm (VP) infants at 36 and 44 weeks&#8217; postmenstrual age (PMA), and at 1-year corrected postnatal age (cPNA). PIO2 was decreased stepwise to achieve SpO2 between 85 and 98%. Shift and shunt were calculated from paired SpO2/PIO2 measurements using customized software. Results were examined cross-sectionally at each time point, and longitudinally using generalized linear regression. Term infants were assessed at 44 wk PMA as a comparative reference. Results: Longitudinal modelling showed continuous decline in shift in EP and VP infants during the first year of life. There was no difference in shift compared to term infants at 44 wk PMA (p = 0.094). EP infants with BPD had higher shift than infants without BPD at 36 wk PMA (p &lt; 0.001) and 44 wk PMA (p = 0.005) but not at 1-year cPNA. Conclusions: In the absence of lung disease, prematurity per se did not result in reduced gas exchange at 1-year cPNA. We report ongoing, significant improvements in pulmonary gas exchange in all preterm infants during the first year of life, despite evidence of early deficits in gas exchange in EP infants with BPD.</description>

                Regional RedOx evolution during the Ediacaran Shuram carbon isotope excursion, Nafun Group, north Oman and southern salt basins Oman Christian J. Bjerrum1, Simon R. Stenger1**, Anne-Sofie C. Ahm1***, 1Department of Geoscience and Natural Resource Management, Nordic Center for Earth Evolution, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen K, Denmark *cjb@ign.ku.dk (corresponding author) **Now at the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute, Trondheim, Norway ***Now at School of Earth and Ocean Sciences, University of Victoria, BC, Canada Geochemical dataset related to the regional RedOx evolution during the Ediacaran Shuram carbon isotope excursion. Geochemical analyses include iron-speciation, redox sensitive element and stable carbon and oxygen isotopes. The sub-regional redox changes likely are reflected in the ratio of highly-reactive Fe (FeHR) to total Fe (FeT) and pyrite Fe to FeHR, in combination with redox-sensitive element enrichments (Alcott et al., 2020; Bennett and Canfield, 2020; Poulton and Canfield, 2005). Dataset samples are from outcrops in Jabal Akhdar area of northern Oman, and borehole cuttings in southern salt basins Oman (TM-6). Outcrops analyzed record an unusual complete representation of the onset of the Shuram excursion exposed along a tributary to Wadi Hajir just east of the Al Hijir village (23&#176;12'12.0 N and 057&#176;30'56.5 E). Samples from the South Oman Salt Basin are borehole cuttings from the TM-6 well, Petroleum Development Oman (PDO). The Shuram Formation in both sections represent the deepest water facies within sub-regional basins that where paleo-geographically separated by more than 800 km (cf. Le Guerroue et al., 2006). From the base to the top the Khufai, Shuram and Buah Formations are part of the The Nafun Group. Limestones and dolostones as part of a prograding shallow marine ramp succession represent the Khufai Formation. The lower Shuram Formation consists of Alternating beds of laminated muddy marls to calcareous mudstones with occasional combined-flow cross-laminated climbing ripples, representing a distal offshore to offshore transitional paleodepositional setting (Le Guerroue et al., 2006). The beds of the lower Shuram Formation grade up into maroon&#8722;blue-green verdigris mudstones interbedded with occasional marls and muddy silt beds with combined-flow ripples that represent the middle Shuram Formation. The upper Shuram Formation is composed of interstratified carbonate marls and mudstones where carbonate content increases up section toward the basal Buah Formation. During field work in 2015 the section was measured and sampled along the tributary to Wadi Hajir. For convenience the sub-sections are named Wadi Hajir 4, 5 and 6 (WH4-6). WH4 represents the upper part of the Khufai Formation, WH5 the lower Shuram Formation, while WH6 represent the lower part of the middle Shuram Formation. WH4 section is exposed on the southern side of the tributary canyon with a small gap of 0-1 m to the base of WH5. WH5 and WH6 represent a nearly continuous and fully exposed section on the northern side of the canyon.

                The origin of dolostones from the Lei 4 Member (T2l4) of the Middle Triassic Leikoupo Formation in the Western Sichuan Depression is unclear. The occurrence and genetic evolution of dolostones in T2l4 were analysed by polarised thin-sections and cathodoluminescence, major- and trace-element, scanning electron microscope, and carbon, oxygen and strontium isotope analyses. The study results are summarised as follows. (1) The dolostones were mainly precipitated in three stages of &lt;40 &#176;C, 40&#8211;60 &#176;C and 60&#8211;80 &#176;C, corresponding with three paleodepth ranges of 167&#8211;300 m, 433&#8211;1000 m and 1067&#8211;1433 m. The micritic dolostones and the fabric-retentive dolostones (algal dolostone, granular dolostone) mainly formed in a near-surface&#8211;shallow-burial environment, and the crystalline dolostones were mainly formed under intermediate burial conditions. (2) 87Sr/86Sr ratios are equivalent to that of the Middle Triassic seawater, Sr/Ba and V/Ni ratios &gt;1, Na notably higher than that in coexisting limestones of T2l4, and the dolostones always coexist with evaporative minerals such as gypsum, indicating that dolomitisation fluids mainly originated from evaporative concentrated seawater. (3) The dolostones mainly inherit materials from precursor limestones based on trace-element distribution patterns, and carbon and oxygen isotope values that are consistent with coexisting limestones of T2l4. (4) Mediated by micro-organisms during the syngenetic period, micritic dolostones and some algal dolostones were formed by replacing aragonites and calcites. During shallow burial, concentrated seawater rich in Mg2+ from the supratidal&#8211;intertidal zone flowed downward owing to gravity along the platform and replaced the underlying carbonate rocks, promoting continuous growth of the early dolomites. In the intermediate burial period, the Mg2+-depleted dolomitisation fluid caused the early micritic and silt-crystalline dolostones to recrystallise into silt- or fine-crystalline dolostones with larger crystals and altered the fabric-retentive dolostones into crystalline dolostones. (5) The evaporative dolostones deposited in the near-surface environment are characterised by maximal enrichment of Fe, Sr and Na, the highest &#948;18O values, the lowest order degree and the highest Ca/Mg ratios. The reflux dolostones formed in a shallow-burial environment characterised by the lowest Fe, medium &#948;18O values and the lowest order degree. The burial dolostones that developed in the intermediate burial environment are characterised by relative enrichment of Fe and Mn, minimal Na, the lowest &#948;18O values, the highest order degree and medium Ca/Mg ratios.KEY POINTSThe fabric-retentive dolostones mainly formed in a near-surface&#8211;shallow-burial environment, and the crystalline dolostones mainly formed under intermediate burial conditions.Dolomitisation fluids mainly originated from the evaporative concentrated seawater, and the dolostones inherit materials from the precursor limestones.Micritic dolostones were formed by evaporative dolomitisation; algal dolostone and granular dolostone were formed by evaporative dolomitisation and reflux dolomitisation; and silt-crystalline dolostone were formed by reflux dolomitisation and burial dolomitisation.

                Data set from Laforgia P, Bandera F, Alfonzetti E, Guazzi M. Exercise chronotropic incompetence phenotypes the level of cardiovascular risk and exercise gas exchange impairment in the general population. An analysis of the Euro-EX prevention trial. Eur J Prev Cardiol. 2020 Mar;27(5):526-535. doi: 10.1177/2047487319863506. Epub 2019 Jul 25. PMID: 31345056. This is the article: Background:  Chronotropic insufficiency (CI) is defined as the inability of the heart to increase its rate commensurate with increased demand. Exercise CI is an established predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Aim:  The aim of this study was to evaluate how exercise CI phenotypes different levels of cardiovascular risk and how it may better perform in defining cardiovascular risk when analysed in the context of cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET)-derived measures and standard echocardiography in a healthy population with variable cardiovascular risk profile. Methods:  Apparently healthy individuals (N = 702, 53.8% females) with at least one major cardiovascular risk factor (MCVRF; hypertension, diabetes, tabagism, dyslipidaemia, body mass index &gt; 25), enrolled in the Euro-EX prevention trial, underwent CPET. CI was defined as the inability to reach 80% of the chronotropic index, that is, the ratio of peak heart rate - rest heart rate/peak heart rate - age predicted maximal heart rate (AMPHR: 220 - age), they were divided into four groups according to the heart rate reserve (&lt;80%&gt;) and respiratory gas exchange ratio (RER; &lt; 1.05&gt;) as a marker of achieved maximal performance. Subjects with a RER &lt; 1.05 (n = 103) were excluded and the final population (n = 599) was divided into CI group (n = 472) and no-CI group (n = 177). Results:  Compared with no-CI, CI subjects were more frequently females with a history of hypertension in a high rate. CI subjects also exhibited a significantly lower peak oxygen uptake (VO2) and circulatory power and an echocardiographic pattern indicative of higher left atrial volume index and left ventricular mass index. An inverse stepwise relationship between heart rate reserve and number of MCVRFs was observed (one MCVRF: 0.71 &#177; 0.23; two MCVRFs: 0.68 &#177; 0.24, three MCVRFs: 0.64 &#177; 0.20; four MCVRFs: 0.64 &#177; 0.23; five MCVRFs: 0.57 &#177; 18; p &lt; 0.01). In multivariate analysis the only variable found predicting CI was peak VO2 (p &lt; 0.05; odds ratio 0.91; confidence interval 0.85-0.97). Conclusions:  In a population of apparently healthy subjects, exercise CI is common and phenotypes the progressive level of cardiovascular risk by a tight relationship with MCVRFs. CI patients exhibit some peculiar abnormal exercise gas exchange patterns (lower peak VO2 and exercise oscillatory ventilation) and echo-derived measures (higher left atrium size and left ventricle mass) that may well anticipate evolution toward heart failure.</description>
