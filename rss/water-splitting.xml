      <title>Impact of Defects and Disorder on the Stability of Ta&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; Photoanodes</title>

                Abstract The photoelectrochemical performance of Ta 3 N 5 photoanodes is strongly impacted by the presence of shallow and deep defects within the bandgap. However, the role of such states in defining stability under operational conditions is not well understood. Here, a highly controllable synthesis approach is used to create homogenous Ta 3 N 5 thin films with tailored defect concentrations to establish the relationship between atomic&#8208;scale point defects and macroscale stability. Reduced oxygen contents increase long&#8208;range structural order but lead to high concentrations of deep&#8208;level states, while higher oxygen contents result in reduced structural order but beneficially passivate deep&#8208;level defects. Despite the different defect properties, the synthesized photoelectrodes degrade similarly under water oxidation conditions due to the formation of a surface oxide layer that blocks interfacial hole injection and accelerates charge recombination. In contrast, under ferrocyanide oxidation conditions, it is found that Ta 3 N 5 films with high oxygen concentrations exhibit long&#8208;term stability, whereas those possessing lower oxygen contents and higher deep&#8208;level defect concentrations rapidly degrade. These results indicate that deep&#8208;level defects result in rapid trapping of photocarriers and surface oxidation but that shallow oxygen donors can be introduced into Ta 3 N 5 to enable kinetic stabilization of the interface.</description>

      <title>Graphene oxide variations in NiGraf during OER: structural dynamics of nickel-based electrocatalysts for enhanced water electrolysis</title>

                Alkaline water electrolysis, which relies on efficient and durable electrocatalysts made from earth-abundant metals like nickel for both hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, is a crucial energy storage technology for the transition to renewable energy. In operando techniques enabling the observation of active catalysts under relevant working conditions by monitoring the surface oxidation state and local atomic-structure transformation, can probe the active sites and promote fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms. In this study we present a new operando investigation of the electrocatalyst NiGraf by synchrotron X-ray Powder Diffraction and Pair Distribution Function. The structural changes in the crystal phases of this new metal organic alloy comprised of graphene oxide entrapped in nickel-based jamborite nanoparticles during voltammetry cycles in the OER range revealed a first reversible variation in the distance between GO planes during the reaction, and the subsequent reaching of the irreversible activation stage of the electrocatalyst. The technique, which couples Pair Distribution Function, Principal Component Analysis and operando electrochemistry is a new tool for the study of electrocatalysts in action.</description>

                Abstract Developing efficient electrocatalysts for water splitting is of great significance for realizing sustainable energy conversion. In this work, Ru sub&#8208;nanoclusters anchored on cobalt&#8208;nickel bimetallic phosphides (Ru&#8208;CoP/Ni 2 P) are constructed by an interfacial confinement strategy. Remarkably, Ru&#8208;CoP/Ni 2 P with low noble metal loading (33.1 &#181;g cm &#8722;2 ) shows superior activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in all pH values, whose turnover frequency (TOF) is 8.7, 15.3, and 124.7 times higher than that of Pt/C in acidic, alkaline, and neutral conditions, respectively. Meanwhile, it only requires the overpotential of 171 mV@10 mA cm &#8722;2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and corresponding TOF is 20.3 times higher than that of RuO 2 . More importantly, the Ru&#8208;CoP/Ni 2 P||Ru&#8208;CoP/Ni 2 P displays superior mass activity of 4017 mA mg noble metal &#8722;1 at 2.0 V in flowing alkaline water electrolyzer, which is 105.1 times higher than that of Pt/C||IrO 2 . In situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates that the Ru sites in Ru&#8208;CoP/Ni 2 P play a key role for water splitting and follow the adsorption evolution mechanism toward OER. Further mechanism studies disclose the confined Ru atom contributes to the desorption of H 2 during HER and the formation of O&#8208;O bond during OER, leading to fast reaction kinetics. This study emphasizes the importance of interface confinement for enhancing electrocatalytic activity.</description>

                Abstract Effective integration of multiple active moieties and strategic engineering of coordinated interfacial junctions are crucial for optimizing the reaction kinetics and intrinsic activities of heterogeneous electrocatalysts. Herein, a simple integrated heterostructure of biphasic Co 0.7 Fe 0.3 /Fe 3 C embedded on in situ grown N&#8208;doped carbon sheets is constructed. Rationally designed CoFe/Fe 3 C&#8208;T 2 owns more accessible active sites and interfacial junction effects, cooperatively boosting the electron and mass transfer, needed for multifunctional electrocatalysis. Leveraging the synergistic effect of dual active sites, CoFe/Fe 3 C&#8208;T 2 demonstrates outstanding oxygen electrocatalytic activity in alkaline medium with an ultra&#8208;low potential gap of 0.58 V, surpassing the recently available state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Moreover, CoFe/Fe 3 C&#8208;T 2 air&#8208;electrode achieves a high peak power density of 249 mW cm &#8722;2 , a large specific capacity of 808 mAh g &#8722;1 and excellent cycling stability for aqueous Zn&#8208;air batteries. Remarkably, the solid&#8208;state flexible ZAB also exhibits satisfactory performance, showcasing an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.43 V and a peak power density of 66 mW cm &#8722;2 . These outstanding results push this catalyst to the top of the list of non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrode materials. This work offers a viable method for using the active&#8208;site&#8208;uniting strategy to create double&#8208;active&#8208;site catalysts, which may find real&#8208;time applications in energy conversion/storage devices.</description>

                Abstract The development of active, stable, and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media is crucial for proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolysis. Inspired by theoretical screening on a series of transition metal incorporated RuO 2 systems, a low Ru&#8208;content solid solution oxide (Ru 0.48 Mn 0.52 O 2 ) achieved is fabricated by a simple two&#8208;step synthesis method through the combination of rutile RuO 2 and &#946;&#8208;MnO 2 . The Ru 0.48 Mn 0.52 O 2 catalyst exhibits an exceptionally low overpotential of 154 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 and maintains a high stability under a high current of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 for 50 h in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 electrolyte. Furthermore, the obtained catalyst exhibits sustained stability at a large current of 0.5 A cm &#8722;2 for at least 50 h when loaded onto a Ti felt. The in&#8208;situ characterization results indicate that Ru 0.48 Mn 0.52 O 2 preferably followed the adsorbate evolution mechanism rather than the lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism during the OER process, contributing to its high activity and stability at large current densities in acidic media.</description>

                The abundant, active, and acidic&#8208;stable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are rare to the proton exchange membrane&#8208;based water electrolysis. Mn&#8208;based materials show promise as electrocatalysts for OER in acid electrolytes. However, the relationship between the stability, activity and structure of Mn&#8208;based catalysts in acidic environments remains unclear. In this study, phase&#8208;pure MnSb2O6 was successfully prepared and investigated as a catalyst for OER in a sulfuric acid solution (pH of 2.0). A comprehensive mechanistic comparison between MnSb2O6 and Mn3O4 revealed that the rate&#8208;determining step for OER on MnSb2O6 is the direct formation of MnIV=O from MnII&#8722;H2O by the 2H+/2e&#8722; process. This process avoids the rearrangement of adjacent MnIII intermediates, leading to outstanding stability and activity.</description>

                The electro&#8208;Fenton (EF) process is an advanced oxidation technology with significant potential; however, it is limited by two steps: generation and activation of H2O2. In contrast to the production of H2O2 via the electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the electrochemical three&#8208;electron (3e&#8208;) ORR can directly activate molecular oxygen to yield the hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH), thus breaking through the conceptual and operational limitations of the traditional EF reaction. Therefore, the 3e&#8208; ORR is a vital process for efficiently producing &#183;OH in situ, thus charting a new path toward the development of green water&#8208;treatment technologies. This review summarizes the characteristics and mechanisms of the 3e&#8208; ORR, focusing on the basic principles and latest progress in the in situ generation and efficient utilization of &#183;OH through the modulation of the reaction pathway, shedding light on the rational design of 3e&#8208; ORR catalysts, mechanistic exploration, and practical applications for water treatment. Finally, the future developments and challenges of efficient, stable, and large&#8208;scale utilization of &#183;OH are discussed based on achieving optimal 3e&#8208; ORR regulation and the potential to combine it with other technologies.</description>

      <title>Synergistic effect of heterogeneous single atoms and clusters for improved catalytic performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.52396/justc-2024-0046</link>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting provides an efficient method for the production of hydrogen. In electrocatalytic water splitting, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves a kinetically sluggish four-electron transfer process, which limits the efficiency of electrocatalytic water splitting. Therefore, it is urgent to develop highly active OER catalysts to accelerate reaction kinetics. Coupling single atoms and clusters in one system is an innovative approach for developing efficient catalysts that can synergistically optimize the adsorption and configuration of intermediates and improve catalytic activity. However, research in this area is still scarce. Herein, we constructed a heterogeneous single-atom cluster system by anchoring Ir single atoms and Co clusters on the surface of Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets. Ir single atoms and Co clusters synergistically improved the catalytic activity toward the OER. Specifically, Co&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; required an overpotential of 255 mV at a current density of 10 mA&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which was 60 mV and 67 mV lower than those of Co&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ir&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. The turnover frequency of Co&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;Ir&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was 0.49 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which was 4.9 times greater than that of Co&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;/Ni(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at an overpotential of 300 mV.</description>

                Abstract Developing low&#8208;cost and industrially viable electrode materials for efficient water&#8208;splitting performance and constructing intrinsically active materials with abundant active sites is still challenging. In this study, a self&#8208;supported porous network Ni(OH) 2 &#8208;CeO x heterostructure layer on a FeOOH&#8208;modified Ni&#8208;mesh (NiCe/Fe@NM) electrode is successfully prepared by a facile, scalable two&#8208;electrode electrodeposition strategy for overall alkaline water splitting. The optimized NiCe 0.05 /Fe@NM catalyst reaches a current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 at an overpotential of 163 and 262 mV for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively, in 1.0 m KOH with excellent stability. Additionally, NiCe 0.05 /Fe@NM demonstrates exceptional HER performance in alkaline seawater, requiring only 148 mV overpotential at 100 mA cm &#8722;2 . Under real water splitting conditions, NiCe 0.05 /Fe@NM requires only 1.701 V to achieve 100 mA cm &#8722;2 with robust stability over 1000 h in an alkaline medium. The remarkable water&#8208;splitting performance and stability of the NiCe 0.05 /Fe@NM catalyst result from a synergistic combination of factors, including well&#8208;optimized surface and electronic structures facilitated by an optimal Ce ratio, rapid reaction kinetics, a superhydrophilic/superaerophobic interface, and enhanced intrinsic catalytic activity. This study presents a simple two&#8208;electrode electrodeposition method for the scalable production of self&#8208;supported electrocatalysts, paving the way for their practical application in industrial water&#8208;splitting processes.</description>

                Abstract Clean and sustainable energy has turned towards electrochemical water splitting as a viable solution in minimizing carbon emissions. Electrolysis of water converts electrical energy to chemical energy, through the production of hydrogen and oxygen gases, which can be harnessed for potential applications without contributing to greenhouse emissions. While this energy storage process shows great potential, its efficiency is hindered by the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As a result, its widespread application in green electrolytic technologies is limited hence investigations on improving OER kinetics are of utmost importance. Recent research breakthroughs indicate that alkali metal cations are more than passive observers. They play complex roles in the electric double layer (EDL), which positively influences the OER kinetics. The presence of numerous ions and their combinations presents a challenge of complexity. This study aims to delve into the impact of alkali metal cations on OER activity due to the variance in their hydration energies. Specific investigations focusing on different alkali metal cations in solution, such as Li + , Na + , and K + , was conducted on RuO 2 to gain a deeper understanding of how these ions interact with both reactants and intermediate species in the reaction kinetics. Traditional electrochemical tests, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and accelerated degradation test (ADT) measurements were employed to elucidate critical aspects such as surface activation, electric double layer interactions, catalytic activity and stability, ohmic resistance, and mass and charge transport.</description>

                Scarce and expensive iridium oxide is still the cornerstone catalyst of polymer-electrolyte membrane electrolyzers for green hydrogen production because of its exceptional stability under industrially relevant oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions. Earth-abundant transition metal oxides used for this task, however, show poor long-term stability. We demonstrate here the use of nitrogen-doped cobalt oxide as an effective iridium substitute. The catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 240 mV at 10 mA cm</description>

                The productions of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydrogen (H2) in a photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting cell suffer from an onset potential that limits solar conversion efficiencies. The formation of H2O2 through two&#8208;electron PEC water oxidation reaction competes with four&#8208;electron oxidation evolution reaction. Herein, we developed the surface selenium doped antimony trisulfide photoelectrode with the integrated ruthenium cocatalyst (Ru/Sb2(S,Se)3) to achieve the low onset potential and high Faraday efficiency (FE) for selective H2O2 production. The photoanode exhibits an average FE of 85% in the potential range of 0.4&#8208;1.6 VRHE and the H2O2 yield of 1.01 &#956;mol cm&#8208;2 min&#8208;1 at 1.6 VRHE, especially at low potentials of 0.1&#8208;0.55 VRHE with 80.4% FE. Impressively, an unassisted PEC system that employs light and electrolyte was constructed to simultaneously produce H2O2 and H2 production on both Ru/Sb2(S,Se)3 photoanode and the Pt/TiO2/Sb2S3 photocathode. The integrated system enables the average PEC H2O2 production rate of 0.637 &#956;mol cm&#8208;2 min&#8208;1 without applying any addition bias. This is the first demonstration that Sb2S3&#8208;based photoelectrodes exhibit H2O2/H2 two&#8208;side production with a strict key factor of the system, which represents its powerful platform to achieve high efficiency and productivity and the feasibility to facilitate value&#8208;added products in neutral conditions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalytic Properties of Novel Nanowire Structures from FeCo&#8208;MOFs/GO via Low&#8208;Temperature Annealing</title>

                Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) often suffer from poor stability, making them suitable precursors for metal oxides/porous carbon catalysts in the oxygen evolution reaction via pyrolysis. High&#8208;temperature treatment, however, leads to significant loss of active sites. To address this, Fe&#8208;MOFs, FeCo&#8208;MOFs, and FeCo&#8208;MOFs/graphene oxide (GO) composites using a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method are synthesized and annealed at a low temperature of 300 &#176;C. Characterization reveals that FeCo&#8208;MOFs/GO composites possess unique nanowire structures mixed with a small amount of nanoflakes. It is believed that introducing graphene oxide plays a critical role in forming this structure, because the defects in GO provide numerous nucleation sites for nanowire growth. With high specific surface area and good stability, these nanostructures show a low overpotential of 261.5 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722; 2 and a Tafel slope of 20.47 mV dec &#8722;1 in 1 mol L &#8722;1 KOH alkaline water electrolysis. Density functional theory calculations further indicate that the synergistic effect of Fe and Co atoms enhances the catalytic activity.</description>

                The development of efficient and Earth-abundant electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is an urgent requirement in the field of electrochemical water splitting. The electrocatalytic performance of the OER can be greatly enhanced by the synergistic combination of zeolite imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) and transition-metal phosphides, both of which individually exhibit promising capabilities in this regard. In this study, a novel amorphous NiCoP deposited on ZIF-67 sheets supported on Ni foam (labeled as NiCoP/ZIF-67/NF) as an OER electrocatalytic material was successfully synthesized using a simple, secure, and time-efficient two-step strategy. The experimental results demonstrate that NiCoP/ZIF-67/NF possesses a large active surface area with abundant active sites. Also, the synergistic effect and interaction between NiCoP and ZIF-67, as well as between Ni and Co within NiCoP, effectively enhance its electrochemical performance under alkaline conditions. Consequently, NiCoP/ZIF-67/NF exhibits outstanding catalytic activity for OER with an overpotential (&#951;) of 175 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm</description>

      <title>Structures, magnetism, and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of azidoisophthalate bridging Cu(II) and Co(II) coordination polymers</title>

                Two newly derived coordination polymers of Cu(II) and Co(II), namely {[Cu(&#956;&#8208;5&#8208;AzIA)(Py) 2 ]&#8901;[Cu(5&#8208;AzIA)(Py) 2 (H 2 O)]} n ( CP1 ) and {[Co(&#956;&#8208;5&#8208;AzIA) 2 (Py) 4 ]&#8901;[Co(5&#8208;AzIA)(Py) 2 ]} n ( CP2 ) ( 5&#8208;AzIA 2&#8722; = 5&#8208;azidoisophthalate; Py = pyridine) are synthesized and structurally characterized by single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction (SXRD), powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD), and Fourier transform infrared data. As evident from thermogravimetric data, CP1 loses coordinated water at 110&#176;C and the final residue reaches at 530&#176;C as CuO; CP2 is stable up to 150&#176;C, and the final residue reaches at 415&#176;C as Co 2 O 3 . 5&#8208;AzIA 2&#8722; serves as both chelating and monodentate carboxylate bridging ligand to the adjacent metal centers ( Cu(II) in CP1 and Co(II) in CP2 ) to construct the CPs . The CPs form eight&#8208;member carboxylato bridging, [M 2 (RCOO) 2 ], and coordinate with Py rings and assemblage through &#960;&#8208;&#8208;&#8208;&#960; interaction. The magnetic measurements of the CPs show antiferromagnetic super&#8208;exchange properties. Interestingly, CP2 shows field&#8208;induced magnetic ordering at a higher magnetic field at a temperature &#820; 2 K owing to the &#960;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#960; stacking between the flagging pyridine moieties. Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) shows excellent catalytic effectiveness of CP2 than CP1 with reference to standard RuO 2 catalyst. The comparative catalytic activity of CP1 and CP2 was thoroughly investigated and well supported by Tafel slope, charge&#8208;transfer resistance (Rct), and electrochemically active surface area calculation.</description>

                Herein, we have developed LaMnO3 (LMO) perovskite&#8208;based electrocatalysts of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR and OER) in a basic aqueous solution. Mechanochemical grinding and thermal annealing leads to highly&#8208;pure perovskites as shown by X&#8208;ray diffraction. This methodology allows as well for a swift integration of RuO2 additive which improves especially the oxygen evolution reaction. ORR have been analyzed by rotating ring&#8208;disk electrode (RRDE). Eventually, these catalysts are employed in Zn/air batteries resulting in specific capacity values of 12.76 Ahg&#8208;1 at 1 Ag&#8208;1, when LMO&#8208;RuO2 (LMO&#8208;Ru) was used as catalyst in the positive electrodes. Besides, high operational stability of Zn/air batteries for over 100 cycles was obtained, saving 1,46 mWh per cycle when LMO&#8208;Ru was used with respect to pure LMO.</description>

                Surface reconstruction determines the fate of catalytic sites on the near-surface during the oxygen evolution reaction. However, deciphering the conversion mechanism of various intermediate-states during surface reconstruction remains a challenge. Herein, we employed an optical imaging technique to draw the landscape of dynamic surface reconstruction on individual Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles. By regulating the surface states of Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles, we explored dynamic growth of the CoO x (OH) y sublayer on single Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles and directly identified the conversion between two dynamics. Rich oxygen vacancies induced more active sites on the surface and prolonged surface reconstruction, which enhanced electrochemical redox and oxygen evolution. These results were further verified by in situ electrochemical extinction spectroscopy of single Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles. We elucidate the heterogeneous evolution of surface reconstruction on individual Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles and present a unique perspective to understand the fate of catalytic species on the nanosurface, which is of enduring significance for investigating the heterogeneity of multielectron-transfer events.</description>

                Platinum (Pt) has been widely used as cathodic electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) but unfortunately neglected as an anodic electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to excessively strong bonding with oxygen species in water splitting electrolyzers. Herein we report that fine control over the electronic-structure and local-coordination environment of Pt-rich PtPbCu nanowires (NWs) by doping of iridium (Ir) lowers the overpotential of the OER and simultaneously suppresses the overoxidation of Pt in IrPtPbCu NWs during water electrolysis. In light of the one-dimensional morphology featured with atomically dispersed IrO</description>

                The band gap constraint of the photocatalyst for overall water splitting limits the utilization of solar energy. A strategy to broaden the range of light absorption is employing a two-dimensional (2D) polar material as photocatalyst, benefiting from the deflection of the energy level due to their intrinsic internal electric field. Here, by using first-principles computational screening, we search for 2D polar semiconductors for photocatalytic water splitting from both ground- and excited-state perspectives. Applying a unique electronic structure model of polar materials, there are 13 photocatalyst candidates for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 8 candidates for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) without barrier energies from the perspective of the ground-state free energy variation calculation. In particular, Cu</description>

      <description>Gao Chen, Yanping Zhu, Sixuan She, Zezhou Lin, Hainan Sun, Haitao Huang, InfoMat. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400746813

                Abstract Most electrocatalysts are known to experience structural change during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process. Considerable endeavors have been dedicated thus far to comprehending the catalytic process and uncovering the underlying mechanism. During the dynamic evolution of catalyst structure, component leaching of electrocatalysts is the most common phenomenon. This article offers a concise overview of recent findings and developments related to the leaching phenomena in the OER process in terms of fundamental understanding of leaching, advanced characterization techniques used to investigate leaching, leaching of inactive components, and leaching of active components. Leaching behaviors and the induced effects in various kinds of OER catalysts are discussed, progress in manipulating leaching amount/degree toward a tunable surface evolution is spotlighted, and finally, three representative types of structure transformations induced by leaching metastable species in OER condition are proposed. By understanding the process of component leaching in the OER, it will provide more guidance for the rational design of superior electrocatalysts. image</description>

                Abstract Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) and their composites are promising non-platinum electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution (HER), oxygen evolution (OER), and oxygen reduction (ORR) reactions. But traditional methods to obtain these electrocatalysts are usually multi-step and include the participation of hazardous phosphorus compounds during phosphidation. Here, the possibility of using a polyaniline doped with phosphoric acid (PANI&#8729;H3PO4) &#8211; as a source of C, N and P simultaneously - to obtain composites based on N,P-doped carbon and nano- and/or submicron TMP particles as HER, OER and ORR electrocatalysts is demonstrated. The pyrolysis of PANI&#8729;H3PO4 together with Co, Ni, Mo, or Fe salt allows the formation of such composite electrocatalysts by the carbon thermal reduction route. Regardless of the pH of the electrolyte, the MoP-based electrocatalyst is characterized in HER by the smallest Tafel slope and overpotential of hydrogen evolution and also exhibits high stability during long-term operation. At the same time, other composites are multifunctional electrocatalysts possessing activity not only in HER, but also in OER and ORR. The proposed approach can be a starting point for a simple, universal in choice of d-metal, and environmentally attractive preparation of multifunctional TMP-based electrocatalysts with further improvement of their performance.</description>

                Abstract Lattice&#8208;confined single&#8208;atom catalyst (LC SAC), featuring exceptional activity, intriguing stability and prominent selectivity, has attracted extensive attention in the fields of various reactions (e.g., hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), etc.). To design a &#8220;smart&#8221; LC SAC for catalytic applications, one must systematically comprehend updated advances in the preparation, the application, and especially the peculiar electron regulation mechanism of LC SAC. In this review, the specific preparation methods of LC SAC based on general coordination strategy are updated, and its applications in HER, OER, ORR, N 2 reduction reaction (NRR), advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and so forth are summarized to display outstanding activity, stability and selectivity. Uniquely, the electron regulation mechanisms are first and deeply discussed and can be primarily categorized as electron transfer bridge with monometallic active sites, novel catalytic centers with polymetallic active sites, and positive influence by surrounding environments. In the end, the existing issues and future development directions are put forward with a view to further optimize the performance of LC SAC. This review is expected to contribute to the in&#8208;depth understanding and practical application of highly efficient LC SAC.</description>

                ABSTRACT A novel electrically chargeable galvanic system is presented that efficiently stores energy in the form of zinc and releases hydrogen and electricity upon discharge. In this concept, oxygen is released at the gas electrode during charging, and zinc oxide is reduced to metallic zinc at the counter electrode. When the cell is discharged on demand, the zinc is converted back to zinc oxide, but the water is reduced at the gas electrode to produce hydrogen. The system can therefore be used not only to store electricity&#8212;in combination with a fuel cell&#8212;but also as an on&#8208;demand hydrogen generator, for example, for industrial use. When used as an electrical storage system, the overall round&#8208;trip efficiency can approach 50%, significantly exceeding the efficiency of alternative power&#8208;to&#8208;gas technologies. There are no hydrogen storage or transportation losses. The electrochemical cell combines two breakthrough technologies: a bifunctional catalyst for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction that survives thousands of oxidation and reduction cycles, and a dendrite&#8208;free deposition of thick, high&#8208;capacity zinc coatings that can be cycled almost indefinitely thanks to pulsed charge current and intelligent electronic control.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study on the carbon nanomaterial&#8208;supported Pt complex electrocatalysts for efficient and selective chlorine evolution reaction</title>

                Chlorine is an important chemical which has long been produced in chlor-alkali process using dimensionally stable anodes (DSA). However, some serious drawbacks of DSA inspire the development of alternative anodes for chlorine evolution reaction (CER). In this study, we focused on the graphene- and carbon nanotube-supported platinum tetra-phenyl porphyrins as electrocatalysts for CER, which have been theoretically investigated based on density functional theory. Our results reveal that the supported substrates possess potential CER electrocatalytic activity with very low thermodynamic overpotentials (0.012-0.028 V) via Cl* pathway instead of ClO*. The electronic structures analyses showed that electron transfer from the support to the adsorbed chlorine via the Pt center leads to strong Pt-Cl interactions. Furthermore, the supported electrocatalysts exhibited excellent selectivity toward CER because of high overpotentials and reaction barriers of oxygen evolution process. Therefore, our results may pave the way for designing CER electrocatalyst utilizing emerging carbon nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Indium&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Nanocomposites with Improved Oxygen Reaction Activity and Durability for Reversible Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cell Air Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202409188</link>
      <description>Zhiwei Du, Kang Xu, Feng Zhu, Yangsen Xu, Fan He, Hui Gao, Wenjie Gong, YongMan Choi, Yu Chen, Advanced functional materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400589229

                Abstract Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) are very promising as energy conversion and storage devices with high efficiency at intermediate temperatures (500&#8211;700 &#176;C). Unfortunately, the sluggish reaction kinetics on air electrodes severely hamper the commercial application of R&#8208;PCECs. In this work, an In&#8208;doped PrBaCo 2 O 5+&#948; air electrode is developed with a designed formula of PrBaCo 1.9 In 0.1 O 5+&#948; , which however consists of a dominated double perovskite PrBa 0.95 Co 1.85 In 0.09 O 5+&#948; and a minor cubic perovskite BaCo 0.85 In 0.15 O 3&#8208;&#948; phase, as suggested by the XRD refinements. The formation of nanocomposites induced by the In&#8208;doping has markedly improved the activity of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), due likely to the increased oxygen vacancies, enhanced the oxygen surface exchange and bulk diffusion capabilities when compared to the bare PrBaCo 2 O 5+&#948; . Excellent electrochemical performances in fuel cell (FC) mode (2.25 W cm &#8722;2 ) and electrolysis cell (EC) mode (&#8722;4.41 A cm &#8722;2 at 1.3 V) are achieved on the single cells with such nanocomposite air electrodes at 700 &#176;C. In addition, promising durability tests of cells in modes of FC (100 h), EC (100 h), and cycling (210 h) are demonstrated at 600 &#176;C. This In&#8208;doped strategy provides a novel approach to developing new air electrode materials.</description>

                Abstract In the present work a facile method was adopted for the fabrication of highly active and dimensionally stable cobalt-reduced graphene oxide (rGO) based composite electrode for OER process. The metal loading and the amount of graphene was optimized for better performance of the electrode. The development of these type of electrodes is noteworthy taking the advantage of the method and the materials used. The morphology and the composition were analyzed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS). Spectroscopic characterization was done using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. Electrochemical characterization revealed excellent electro-catalytic activity of the prepared electrode and strongly suggest synergistic reaction between Co3O4 and rGO. The developed electrode can realize excellent Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER) activity in alkaline media with low over potential and low tafel slope with long-term stability as evidenced from various analysis.</description>

      <title>Nonpyrolytic Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe2O3 heterostructure with RuO2&#8208;like OER Activity Synthesized via Polyacrylonitrile&#8208;derived Conjugated Pyridinic&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon Sheet</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202400786</link>

                Pyrolytic single Fe atom&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;carbon materials (Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C) and their derivatives are excellent catalysts for electrochemical oxygen reduction reactions. However, they exhibit poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity due to non&#8208;optimal Fe&#8208;O* bonding. This limitation is overcome via electronic structure modulation (i.e., tuning the heteroatom type, concentration, and location within Fe&#8217;s n &#8805; 1 coordination sphere). However, the methods used are complex and energy&#8208;intensive (i.e., 1000 to 1200&#176;C) raising concerns about reproducibility and cost. This study introduces a method for synthesizing nonpyrolytic Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe2O3 composites with similar electronic structure modulation as pyrolytic Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C and OER activity akin to commercial RuO2. The methodology involves doping low&#8208;melting hydrated Fe&#8208;salts in electrospun polyacrylonitrile nanofiber to catalyze its transformation into conjugated pyridinic&#8208;N&#8208;rich graphite&#8208;like sheets (i.e., N&#8208;C) at 300&#176;C. N&#8208;C chelate effectively with oxygen&#8208;vacant (Ov)&#8208;rich Fe atoms derived from Fe2O3 NPs resulting in Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe2O3 heterostructures. The Fe2O3 coupling effectively tunes Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C&#8217;s electronic structure via Ov modulation. Consequently, the Fermi and d&#8208;orbital energy levels are optimized leading to partial filling of the antibonding states, optimal Fe&#8208;O* bonding, high electrochemically active surface area, and OER activity. Because Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C/Fe2O3 is synthesized at 300 oC using well&#8208;established techniques, its complexity and cost are favorable compared to pyrolytic Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C materials.</description>

                Abstract Replacing the slow protonation process of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the fast protonation of alcohol electro&#8208;oxidation can decrease the driving potentials, thus improving overall efficiency of electrochemical devices. However, the formation of effective catalytic sites for alcohol oxidation remains challenging in accelerating protonation to inhibit metal leaching and improve catalyst stability. Herein, asymmetric Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Cr sites are constructed by alloying Cr into the NiO matrix to optimize coordination environments, showing significantly enhanced stability during alcohol electro&#8208;oxidation. The asymmetric Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Cr can maintain constant valence states of Cr and Ni during alcohol oxidation, efficiently suppressing metal dissolution even at high oxidation potentials. In situ electrochemical characterizations combined with theoretical calculations indicate that asymmetric Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Cr can improve adsorption and activation of OH* and alcohol molecules compared to pure NiO, thus increasing anodic kinetics. The theoretical results also indicate that the smaller gap of Ni 3 d &#8208;O 2 p in asymmetric Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Cr strengthens charge transfer, leading to fast protonation of catalytic sites with enhanced stability. This work gives insights into boosting anodic protonation using asymmetric sites&#8208;enriched solid&#8208;solution electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract Facing the resource and environmental pressures brought by the retiring wave of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), direct recycling methods are considered to be the next generation's solution. However, the contradiction between limited battery life and the demand for rapidly iterating technology forces the direct recovery paradigm to shift toward &#8220;direct upcycling.&#8221; Herein, a closed&#8208;loop direct upcycling strategy that converts waste current collector debris into dopants is proposed, and a highly inclusive eutectic molten salt system is utilized to repair structural defects in degraded polycrystalline LiNi 0.83 Co 0.12 Mn 0.05 O 2 cathodes while achieving single&#8208;crystallization transformation and introducing Al/Cu dual&#8208;doping. Upcycled materials can effectively overcome the two key challenges at high voltages: strain accumulation and lattice oxygen evolution. It exhibits comprehensive electrochemical performance far superior to commercial materials at 4.6 V, especially its fast charging capability at 15 C, and an impressive 91.1% capacity retention after 200 cycles in a 1.2 Ah pouch cell. Importantly, this approach demonstrates broad applicability to various spent layered cathodes, particularly showcasing its value in the recycling of mixed spent cathodes. This work effectively bridges the gap between waste management and material performance enhancement, offering a sustainable path for the recycling of spent LIBs and the production of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;voltage cathodes.</description>

      <title>In situ UV-Vis spectroscopy study of the water electrooxidation on cobalt oxide catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-srmwb</link>

                Despite the current prominence of cobalt oxides as the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), there is a lack of unambiguous demonstration for the presence and the role of Co4+ prior to/during the OER. Here, we combine electrochemistry with in situ UV-Vis spectroscopy to investigate and discuss the previously unaddressed effect of different electrolyte pH in the range from pH 12.2 to pH 14.0 on the population of Co4+ in thin films of CoOx and its concomitant impact on their OER performance. Our UV-Vis spectroscopic findings indicate that, not only can the overall redox conversion of Co be qualitatively monitored as a function of potential and pH, but also the Co3+ oxidation assigned to a peak at 800 nm can be more quantitatively tracked in situ via stepped potential spectroelectrochemistry; with their optical signals becoming stronger at higher electrolyte pH within Co3+/ Co4+ conversion region, which is consistent with voltammetric observations that manifest heightened Co3+ oxidation current, indicating an enhancement in Co oxidation state and the consequent predominance of Co4+ under elevated pH conditions. Furthermore, the OER activity shows a positive correlation with Co4+ density (i.e., with electrolyte pH) in the potential region that is higher than 1.57 VRHE, leading to a non-zero OH- reaction order on RHE scale in the same region. This study not only provides spectral insight into the redox chemistry of Co at OER-relevant potentials but also highlights the importance of Co4+ in facilitating the alkaline OER at high pH and current densities.</description>

      <title>The Role of Carbon Catalyst Coatings in the Electrochemical Water Splitting Reaction</title>

                Abstract The availability of efficient electrocatalysts is key to the development of next-generation electrolyzers for water splitting to produce so-called &#8216;green hydrogen&#8217; for a future hydrogen economy. The oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) is one half of the water-splitting reaction and is slow at most electrocatalysts. Designing inexpensive, sustainable, stable, and high-performance OER electrocatalysts remains the largest obstacle hindering the development of new electrolyzers. Carbon-coated metal/metal oxide (nano)particles have been used in such applications, but the role played by the carbon coatings in electrocatalysis has provoked debate in the field and is poorly understood. We show here that the carbon coating itself acts as the active site in OER, with the underlying material activating the carbon through a charge-transfer mechanism. We demonstrate this phenomenon using model catalysts consisting of &lt; 2 nm metal-oxide electrocatalyst nanoparticles encapsulated within single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Access of electrolyte to the encapsulated metal oxides is blocked by plugging the SWNTs with fullerenes, which shuts off redox processes inherent to the metal oxide but does not affect catalytic activity, showing that the carbon surface is the active OER site. This analysis is supported by electrochemical analysis, which shows that the rate-determining step for the OER is the same at SWNT with and without encapsuled metal oxides, but different to that at bare metal oxides. In-situ electrochemical Raman spectroscopy and computational analysis demonstrate that charge transfer from the carbon host to the metal oxide occurs during the OER. This charge transfer results in a decrease in electron density on the carbon surface, which may facilitate binding of &#8211;OH to the carbon surface, the first step in the OER and the RDS (as determined by electrochemical analysis) and may be key to the activity of carbon coated electrocatalysts. This understanding of how carbon coatings play an active role in electrocatalytic reactions is crucial for the development of future low cost, sustainable electrocatalysts for the OER, and the proposed charge transfer-driven mechanism could be tuneable to both oxidative and reductive reactions.</description>

                The eruption of Nova V2891 Cygni in 2019 offers a rare opportunity to explore the shock-induced processes in novae ejecta. The spectral evolution shows noticeable differences in the evolution of various oxygen emission lines such as O I 7773 {\AA}, O I 8446 {\AA}, O I 1.1286 $\mu$m, O I 1.3164 $\mu$m, etc. Here, we use spectral synthesis code CLOUDY to study the temporal evolution of these oxygen emission lines. Our photoionization model requires the introduction of a component with a very high density ($n ~ 10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$) and an enhanced oxygen abundance (O/H $\sim$ 28) to produce the O I 7773 {\AA} emission line, suggesting a stratification of material with high oxygen abundance within the ejecta. An important outcome is the behaviour of the O I 1.3164 $\mu$m line, which could only be generated by invoking the collisional ionization models in CLOUDY. Our phenomenological analysis suggests that O I 1.3164 $\mu$m emission originates from a thin, dense shell characterized by a high density of about $10^{12.5} - 10^{12.8}$ cm$^{-3}$, which is most likely formed due to the strong internal collisions. If such is the case, the O I 1.3164 $\mu$m emission presents itself as a tracer of shock-induced dust formation in V2891 Cyg. The collisional ionization models have also been successful in creating the high-temperature conditions ($~ 7.07 - 7.49 \times 10^5$ K) required to reproduce the observed high ionization potential coronal lines, which coincide with the epoch of dust formation and evolution of the O I 1.3164 $\mu$m emission line.</description>

The spectral evolution shows noticeable differences in the evolution of various oxygen emission lines such as O i 7773 &#197;, O i 8446 &#197;, O i 1.1286 &#956;m, O i 1.3164 &#956;m, etc. Here, we use spectral synthesis code cloudy to study the temporal evolution of these oxygen emission lines.

      <title>Melting at the base of a terrestrial magma ocean controlled by oxygen fugacity</title>

                Abstract Heat delivered from accretionary impacts is thought to have led to extensive melting of early Earth&#8217;s silicate mantle, resulting in a deep magma ocean covering the surface. The mantle&#8217;s oxygen fugacity is thought to have increased over accretion and core formation due to increasingly oxidated impactors and lower mantle self-oxidation, but the influence of this on the solidus of deep primitive mantle materials has not been well constrained. Here we assess the effect of oxygen fugacity on conditions at the bottom of a magma ocean by experimentally determining the solidus of mantle pyrolite at pressures of 16&#8211;26 GPa at high oxygen fugacities. We find that over this pressure range, the solidus in experiments conducted under oxidizing conditions is at least 230&#8211;450 &#176;C lower than in experiments conducted under more reducing conditions. Assuming constant magma ocean temperature, this would imply a magma ocean floor that deepens by about 60 km for each log unit increase in mantle oxygen fugacity. The strong influence of oxygen fugacity on mantle melting suggests that models of early Earth thermal evolution and geochemical models of core formation should be reassessed.</description>

                Abstract Achieving a high dispersity of deposited transition metal is crucial in the anodization preparation of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free composites for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Herein, for the first time, an in situ ion pumping anodization method is proposed to confine single&#8208;atom Fe within the spatially ordered structure of anodized TiO 2 nanotubes (TNT), assisted by ferric sodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as an &#8220;ion pump&#8221; to deliver Fe 3+ toward anodes. Both experimental and theoretical calculations confirm that highly dispersed single&#8208;atom Fe can interact with single&#8208;electron&#8208;trapped oxygen vacancies (SETOV), effectively reducing the oxygen vacancy concentration in TiO 2 nanotubes. This reduction promotes efficient charge carrier separation through the Fe(III)/Fe(II) pathway and enhances hydrogen desorption, ultimately boosting the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance.</description>

                Species of the carnivorous family Lentibulariaceae exhibit the smallest genomes in flowering plants. We explored the hypothesis that their minute genomes result from the unique mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) mutation. The mutation may boost mitochondrial efficiency, which is especially useful for suction-bladder traps of Utricularia, but also increase DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species, leading to genome shrinkage through deletion-biased DNA repair. We aimed to explore this mutation's impact on genome size, providing insights into genetic mutation roles in plant genome evolution under environmental pressures.</description>

                The present work, which has been carried out in the framework of EEA project BLUE-GREENWAY, is a contribution to the study of the evolution of hypoxia/anoxia in Aitoliko lagoon, Greece. The study area suffers from anoxia which is a very important environmental problem lately mainly due to anthropogenic activities. Unpublished data from two measurement campaigns (2013&#8211;2014, 2023) have been used, and a 3D ocean model (SINMOD) has been configured for the region, that couples hydrodynamics, biochemistry and ecology. The analysis of model results includes monthly, annual and interannual variability of fields of dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, density, currents and wind as well as Brunt-V&#228;isala frequency and Richardson number. Main results concerning oxygen are: a) the lagoon shows anoxic behavior at 5&#8211;7 m depth with a seasonal dependence, b) the seasonal variability in the upper water column with deeper ventilation during winter when the surface stratification is weaker than that during summer, c) anoxic water is reaching the surface of the lagoon for a short period of time.</description>

      <title>Thirty Years of Progress in Our Understanding of the Nature and Influence of Fire in Carboniferous Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/fire7070248</link>

                Until the late 20th century, the idea of identifying wildfires in deep time was not generally accepted. One of the basic problems was the fact that charcoal-like wood fragments, so often found in sedimentary rocks and in coals, were termed fusain and, in addition, many researchers could not envision wildfires in peat-forming systems. The advent of Scanning Electron Microscopy and studies on modern charcoals and fossil fusains demonstrated beyond doubt that wildfire residues may be recognized in rocks dating back to at least 350 million years. Increasing numbers of studies on modern and fossil charcoal assemblages from the 1970s through the 1990s established the potential importance of wildfires in the fossil record, using Carboniferous examples in particular. Since the 1990s, extensive progress has been made in understanding modern wildfires and their byproducts. New techniques to study ancient charcoals have allowed considerable progress to be made to integrate modern and ancient fire studies, both before and after the evolution of mankind. Four important developments have made a reassessment of Carboniferous wildfires necessary: the recognition of the role of atmospheric oxygen in controlling the occurrence of wildfire; the development of new microscopical techniques allowing more detailed anatomical data to be obtained from charcoal; the integration of molecular studies with the evolution of fire traits; and new developments in or understanding of post-fire erosion/deposition systems.</description>

      <title>Elevational constraints on flight efficiency shape global gradients in avian wing morphology</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.12.603304</link>
      <description>Jingyi Yang, Chenyue Yang, Hsi&#8211;Hsin Lin, Alexander Charles Lees, Joseph A. Tobias, No host. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400747516

                Wings with elongated shape or larger surface area are associated with increased flight efficiency and dispersal ability in a wide range of animals from insects to birds. Inter- and intraspecific variation in these attributes of wing shape is determined by a range of factors - including foraging ecology, migration and climatic seasonality - all of which may drive latitudinal gradients in wing morphology. A separate hypothesis predicts that wing shape should also follow an elevational gradient because air density and oxygen supply decline with altitude, altering the aerodynamics of flight, and driving the evolution of more efficient wings in high-elevation species to compensate for reduced lift. However, previous analyses have found only mixed support for the 'thin-air' hypothesis, and we currently lack a global synthesis of elevational gradients in wing design for any taxonomic group. In this study, we use phylogenetic comparative models to explore elevational effects on wing morphology in 9986 bird species, while accounting for multiple climatic and ecological attributes, including latitude, temperature seasonality, body mass, aerial lifestyle and migration. We found that relative wing elongation (hand-wing index) and wing area increase with elevation, particularly in the upper montane zone (&gt;4 km above sea level). These results confirm a pervasive elevational gradient in avian wing morphology, highlighting the role of aerodynamic constraints as key mechanisms shaping global patterns of trait evolution in flying animals.</description>

      <title>Dynamic redox conditions in Mesoproterozoic shallow seawater: Constraints from carbonate fabrics and geochemistry</title>

                The delayed eukaryote evolution during the mid-Proterozoic may have been linked to prolonged low oxygen levels during this period. Two short oxygenation events have recently been identified at ca. 1.57 Ga and ca. 1.4 Ga, but the redox conditions during the intervening interval remain poorly constrained. In this study, we conducted mineralogical and geochemical investigations on three sections of the Wumishan Formation (ca. 1.52&#8722;1.47 Ga) that were deposited between the two oxygenation events in the Yanliao basin. The results revealed two distinct changes in carbonate mineralogy and precipitation style associated with concurrent changes in carbonate I/(Ca + Mg): a transition from intervals with positive I/(Ca + Mg) anomalies and abundant water-column carbonate mud to intervals with no I/(Ca + Mg) anomalies and abundant seafloor precipitates, suggesting a shift from suboxic to anoxic conditions in shallow seawater. In both of the suboxic intervals, I/(Ca + Mg) values reached 0.5&#8722;2.6 &#956;mol/mol, with negative Ce anomalies (Ce/Ce*(SN) = 0.69; data from literature) occurring in the later interval (ca. 1.48 Ga). The results suggest significant redox fluctuations in the shallow seawater during the Mesoproterozoic. However, these pulsed oxygenation episodes may not have been sufficient to sustain the continuous evolution of early eukaryotes.</description>

                Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global health crisis and there is an urgent need to better understand AMR mechanisms. Antibiotic treatment alters several aspects of bacterial physiology, including increased ATP utilization, carbon metabolism, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. However, how the "bioenergetic stress" induced by increased ATP utilization affects treatment outcomes is unknown. Here we utilized a synthetic biology approach to study the direct effects of bioenergetic stress on antibiotic efficacy. We engineered a genetic system that constitutively hydrolyzes ATP or NADH in Escherichia coli. We found that bioenergetic stress potentiates AMR evolution via enhanced ROS production, mutagenic break repair, and transcription-coupled repair. We also find that bioenergetic stress potentiates antimicrobial persistence via potentiated stringent response activation. We propose a unifying model that antibiotic-induced antimicrobial resistance and persistence is caused by antibiotic-induced. This has important implications for preventing or curbing the spread of AMR infections.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Engineering of Fluorescent Carbon Dots with Metal Oxides for Real&#8208;Time Visualization of Oxygen Vacancy Dynamics</title>

                Oxygen vacancy (Vo), as one of the most common surface defects, significantly influence the physiochemical properties of metal oxides. However, it remains a challenge for existing techniques to visualize the evolution of Vo during redox process due to its heterogeneous distribution, small size, and dynamic nature. Herein, the real-time monitoring of such microscopic interfacial events is reported by advantage of the high-contrast fluorescence response of carbon dots (H-CDs) to Vo. The green emissive H-CDs possess a unique disc-shaped structure and exceptional hydrophilicity, allowing their tight adhesion to the surfaces of Vo-rich MgO by simple mixing. Subsequently, a water involved interfacial reaction occurred between H-CDs and Vo, resulting in gradual quenching of the original green emission and simultaneously emergence of bright red fluorescence. Moreover, the spatiotemporal diffusion dynamics and reaction kinetics are investigated by confocal laser scanning microscopy, revealing the time-dependent reorganization and structural heterogeneity at the interface. The finding provides a new toolbox for in situ imaging of Vo-triggered phenomena at a microscopic level, which will be helpful in promoting the rational design of oxide materials.</description>

                Abstract Cancer is a serious public health issue and cases are rising at a high rate around the world. Altered production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes oxidative stress (OS) which plays a vital role in cancer development by disrupting signaling pathways and genomic integrity in the cellular microenvironment. In this study, we reviewed the regulation of noncoding RNAs, histone modifications, and DNA methylation which OS is involved in. These mechanisms promote cancer growth, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. There is significant potential to improve patient outcomes through the development of customized medications and interventions that precisely address the role of OS in the onset and progression of cancer. Redox-modulating drugs, antioxidant-based therapies, and measures to restore regular cellular activity and OS-modulated signaling pathways are some examples of these strategies. One other hypothesis rationalizes the cancer-suppressing effect of OS, which acts as a two-edged condition that warns against the use of antioxidants for cancer treatment and management. The present study was executed to review the impact of OS on epigenetic machinery, the evolution of metastatic cancer, and how OS mediates cellular signaling. Along with, insights into the potential of targeting OS-mediated mechanisms for cancer therapy.</description>

                Background Immunocompromised patients are at high risk of developing persisting/prolonged COVID-19. Data concerning early combined use of antivirals and monoclonal antibodies in this population are scarce. Research design and methods We performed an observational, prospective study, enrolling immunocompromised outpatient adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 treated with a combination of sotrovimab plus one antiviral (remdesivir or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) within 7 days from symptoms onset. Results We enrolled 52 patients. No patient was hospitalized within 30 days from the disease onset, needed oxygen administration or died within 60 days, or experienced a reinfection or a clinical relapse within 90 days. Clearance rates were 67% and 97% at 14th day after the end of therapy and at the end of follow-up, respectively. Factors associated with longer infection were initiation of therapy after 3 days from symptoms onset, and enrollment more than 180 days from the beginning of the study. However, only the latter factor was independently associated with longer SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting a loss of efficacy of this strategy with the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants Conclusions Early administration of combination therapy with a direct antiviral and sotrovimab seems to be effective in preventing hospitalization, progression to severe COVID-19 and the development of prolonged/persisting SARS-CoV-2 infection in immunocompromised patients.</description>

                &lt;p&gt;Extracting and analyzing data from smartphones, IoT devices, and drones is crucial for conducting digital crime investigations. Effective cyberattack mitigation necessitates the use of advanced Android mobile forensics techniques. The investigation necessitates proficiency in manual, logical, hex dump, chip-off, and microread methodologies. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of Android mobile forensics tools and techniques for digital crime investigation, as well as their use in gathering and analyzing evidence. Forensic software tools like Cellebrite UFED, Oxygen Forensic Detective, XRY by MSAB, Magnet AXIOM, SPF Pro by SalvationDATA, MOBILedit Forensic Express, and EnCase Forensic employ both physical and logical techniques to retrieve data from mobile devices. These advanced tools offer a structured approach to tackling digital crimes effectively. We compare dependability, speed, compatibility, data recovery accuracy, and reporting. Mobile-network forensics ensures data acquisition, decryption, and analysis success. Conclusions show that Android mobile forensics tools for digital crime investigations are diverse and have different capabilities. Mobile forensics software offers complete solutions, but new data storage and encryption methods require constant development. The continuous evolution of forensic software tools and a comprehensive tool classification system could further enhance digital crime investigation capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Constraints from Parallaxes and Average Period Spacings in the Asteroseismic Study of Eight Hydrogen-atmosphere Pulsating White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ad4edc</link>
      <description>A. Bischoff&#8208;Kim, Keaton J. Bell, Astrophysical journal/&#152;The &#156;Astrophysical journal. 970(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400594234

                Abstract With space missions such as Kepler, TESS, and Gaia, we have a wealth of data on pulsating white dwarfs that can be leveraged in white dwarf asteroseismology. We address the question of the proportion of white dwarfs with thin hydrogen layers versus those with thick hydrogen layers. We also provide a mass&#8211;radius relation for carbon&#8211;oxygen-core, hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs. Such a relationship can be used in conjunction with magnitudes and distance measurements to constrain the mass and effective temperature of the white dwarfs. We select nine hydrogen-atmosphere pulsating white dwarfs for their rich pulsation spectra. From such pulsation spectra, we can derive the asymptotic period spacing, which in turn allows us to determine the thickness of the hydrogen and helium envelope of the models, without having to perform period-by-period fitting. We find that the majority of the white dwarfs have thicker hydrogen layers and we determine an upper limit of M r = 1&#8211;10 &#8722;2.2 for the location of the base of the helium layer, in accordance with stellar evolution models. We confirm a finding from earlier studies that used a mass&#8211;radius relation and Gaia data to determine the effective temperatures of white dwarfs. The Gaia data systematically point to white dwarfs of lower effective temperature than indicated by the spectroscopy. Our results also support the hypothesis that white dwarfs with thicker hydrogen layers are more common than those with thinner layers.</description>

      <title>A record of magmatic differentiation in plutonic xenoliths from Santorini (Greece)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.30909/vol.07.02.421446</link>
      <description>Sean Whitley, Ralf Halama, Ralf Gertisser, Thor H. Hansteen, Matthias Frische, Torsten Vennemann, Volcanica. 7(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400701470

                Plutonic xenoliths from volcanic arcs provide unique insights into transcrustal magmatic systems in subduction zone settings. At Santorini volcano in the Central Aegean Volcanic Arc (Greece), plutonic xenoliths occur throughout a sequence of lavas and pyroclastic rocks erupted within the last ~360 ka. They are mineralogically variable, ranging from troctolites to olivine gabbros, gabbros, gabbronorites, and diorites. Thermobarometric calculations based on mineral and melt inclusion compositions indicate equilibration over a range of temperatures (1100 to 750 &#176;C) at shallow to mid-crustal depths (P &lt;400 MPa), but there is no evidence for crystallisation at lower crustal depths. Oxygen isotope data of mineral separates and calculated &#948;18O melt values are in line with extensive closed-system fractional crystallisation at magmatic temperatures, without a requirement for extensive assimilation of the subvolcanic continental basement. The xenolith minerals compositionally overlap with phenocrysts from the volcanic rocks, but they also contain evidence for the presence of highly evolved melt compositions in the form of melt inclusions with extremely silica-rich compositions (up to 82 wt.% SiO2) and high enrichments of incompatible trace elements coupled with increasing negative Eu anomalies in clinopyroxenes. Since these characteristics correlate systematically with differentiation indices and rock type, they are interpreted to reflect melt evolution via fractional crystallisation as the dominant differentiation process with no significant role of reactive porous flow. These observations highlight that trapped melt fractions can influence mineral compositional variations in the plutonic xenoliths, and in turn the mineral compositions demonstrate a melt compositional variability not preserved in the volcanic rock record.</description>

      <title>Exploring Heterointerface Characteristics and Charge-Storage Dynamics in ALD-Developed Ultra-Thin TiO2-In2O3/Au Heterojunctions</title>

                Directional ionic migration in ultra-thin metal-oxide semiconductors under applied electric fields is a key mechanism for developing various electronic nanodevices. However, understanding charge transfer dynamics is challenging due to rapid ionic migration and uncontrolled charge transfer, which can reduce the functionality of microelectronic devices. This research investigates the supercapacitive-coupled memristive characteristics of ultra-thin heterostructured metal-oxide semiconductor films at TiO2-In2O3/Au Schottky junctions. Using atomic layer deposition (ALD), we nano-engineered In2O3/Au-based metal/semiconductor heterointerfaces. TEM studies followed by XPS elemental analysis revealed the chemical and structural characteristics of the heterointerfaces. Subsequent AFM studies of the hybrid heterointerfaces demonstrated supercapacitor-like behavior in nanometer-thick TiO2-In2O3/Au junctions, resembling ultra-thin supercapacitors, pseudocapacitors, and nanobatteries. The highest specific capacitance of 2.6 &#215; 104 F.g&#8722;1 was measured in the TiO2-In2O3/Au junctions with an amorphous In2O3 electron gate. Additionally, we examined the impact of crystallization, finding that thermal annealing led to the formation of crystalline In2O3 films with higher oxygen vacancy content at TiO2-In2O3 heterointerfaces. This crystallization process resulted in the evolution of non-zero I-V hysteresis loops into zero I-V hysteresis loops with supercapacitive-coupled memristive characteristics. This research provides a platform for understanding and designing adjustable ultra-thin Schottky junctions with versatile electronic properties.</description>

                Abstract We present determinations of the gas-phase and stellar metallicities of a sample of 65 star-forming galaxies at z &#8771; 3.5 using rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectroscopy from the VANDELS survey in combination with follow-up rest-frame optical spectroscopy from VLT/KMOS and Keck/MOSFIRE. We infer gas-phase oxygen abundances (Zg; tracing O/H) via strong optical nebular lines and stellar iron abundances (Z&#8902;; tracing Fe/H) from full spectral fitting to the FUV continuum. Our sample spans the stellar mass range 8.5 &amp;lt; log(M&#8902;/M&#8857;) &amp;lt; 10.5 and shows clear evidence for both a stellar and gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR). We find that our O and Fe abundance estimates both exhibit a similar mass-dependence, such that $\mathrm{Fe/H}\propto M_{\star }^{0.30\pm 0.11}$ and $\mathrm{O/H}\propto M_{\star }^{0.32\pm 0.09}$. At fixed M&#8902; we find that, relative to their solar values, O abundances are systematically larger than Fe abundances (i.e. &#945;-enhancement). We estimate an average enhancement of (O/Fe) = 2.65 &#177; 0.16 &#215; (O/Fe)&#8857; which appears to be independent of M&#8902;. We employ analytic chemical evolution models to place a constraint on the strength of galactic-level outflows via the mass-outflow factor (&#951;). We show that outflow efficiencies that scale as $\eta \propto M_{\star }^{-0.32}$ can simultaneously explain the functional form of of the stellar and gas-phase MZR, as well as the degree of &#945;-enhancement at fixed Fe/H. Our results add further evidence to support a picture in which &#945;-enhanced abundance ratios are ubiquitous in high-redshift star-forming galaxies, as expected for young systems whose interstellar medium is primarily enriched by core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>Quantitative 3D electron microscopy characterization of mitochondrial structure, mitophagy, and organelle interactions in murine atrial fibrillation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2024.108110</link>

                Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common clinical arrhythmia, however there is limited understanding of its pathophysiology including the cellular and ultrastructural changes rendered by the irregular rhythm, which limits pharmacological therapy development. Prior work has demonstrated the importance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial dysfunction in the development of AF. Mitochondrial structure, interactions with other organelles such as sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and T-tubules (TT), and degradation of dysfunctional mitochondria via mitophagy are important processes to understand ultrastructural changes due to AF. However, most analysis of mitochondrial structure and interactome in AF has been limited to two-dimensional (2D) modalities such as transmission electron microscopy (EM), which does not fully visualize the morphological evolution of the mitochondria during mitophagy. Herein, we utilize focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) and perform reconstruction of three-dimensional (3D) EM from murine left atrial samples and measure the interactions of mitochondria with SR and TT. We developed a novel 3D quantitative analysis of FIB-SEM in a murine model of AF to quantify mitophagy stage, mitophagosome size in cardiomyocytes, and mitochondrial structural remodeling when compared with control mice. We show that in our murine model of spontaneous and continuous AF due to persistent late sodium current, left atrial cardiomyocytes have heterogenous mitochondria, with a significant number which are enlarged with increased elongation and structural complexity. Mitophagosomes in AF cardiomyocytes are located at Z-lines where they neighbor large, elongated mitochondria. Mitochondria in AF cardiomyocytes show increased organelle interaction, with 5X greater contact area with SR and are 4X as likely to interact with TT when compared to control. We show that mitophagy in AF cardiomyocytes involves 2.5X larger mitophagosomes that carry increased organelle contents. In conclusion, when oxidative stress overcomes compensatory mechanisms, mitophagy in AF faces a challenge of degrading bulky complex mitochondria, which may result in increased SR and TT contacts, perhaps allowing for mitochondrial Ca</description>

      <title>Does water transparency control the banding in shallow water iron formations?</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.25131/sajg.127.0014</link>
      <description>Daniel Herwartz, Sebastian Viehmann, South African journal of geology. 127(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400747134

                Abstract Iron formations (IFs) are marine chemical sediments that are conined to the Precambrian rock record and provide unique insights into the co-evolution of the atmosphere-hydrosphere and biosphere through almost three billion years of Earth&#8217;s history. IFs commonly appear throughout the Archaean until the Palaeoproterozoic ca. 1.8 billion years ago and re-appear during the &#8220;Snowball Earth&#8221; epoch in the Neoproterozoic. The formation and deposition mechanism(s) of IFs are, however, still incompletely understood, hindering unique interpretations of palaeoenvironments. Many IFs are banded iron formations (BIFs) with layer thickness of alternating Fe- and Si-rich layers ranging over several orders of magnitude from the nanometre to the metre scale. A second textural type, so called granular iron formations (GIFs) that form above storm wave base become widespread in the Palaeoproterozoic. Understanding the fundamental mechanisms that are responsible for the textural types and the periodicity of banding in BIFs is crucial to link these features to the environmental and geochemical evolution of the Earth. We here provide a conceptual model that highlights the role of changing light conditions and water transparency for Iron Formation (IF) precipitation. We show that the model is particularly feasible for IFs deposited in shallow waters but may also be applicable for some IFs deposited in deeper water settings. The model builds on other primary Banded Iron Formation (BIF) precipitation models postulating that Fe(III)-(oxyhydr)oxide production can be dominated by anoxygenic photoautotrophic Fe2+-oxidising bacteria. These so called photoferrotrophs are adapted to very low light levels corresponding to about 1% of the light level required by oxygen-producing phototrophs allowing them to thrive deep down in the water column. The depth of Fe(III)-(oxyhydr)oxide production is mainly controlled by water turbidity which controls how deep photosynthetically available radiation (PAR) penetrates the water column. Eutrophic conditions result in relatively shallow Fe(III)-(oxyhydr)oxide production depth due to turbidity either induced by the biomass itself and/or by particles that are actively or passively produced by microorganisms (e.g., Fe(III) and Mn(IV)-(oxyhydr)oxides, sulphides), triggering the formation of Fe-rich bands. During oligotrophic stages, Fe(III)-(oxyhydr)oxides are only produced relatively deep down in the water column, so that only silica-rich bands form in the Fe(III)-(oxyhydr)oxide free upper water column. Reactive transport modelling adopted from Ozaki et al., (2019) shows that besides upwelling and nutrient supply, alternating Fe(III) production depth is mainly associated with changing light conditions as a result of water transparency. Periodicities reflected by alternating Fe- and Si-rich bands in IFs in our model can thus be associated with: (1) nutrient supply patterns; (2) additional sources of turbidity in the water column such as Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxide particles, sulphides, and wind-blown silicate particles; or (3) formation and clearing of organic haze in the atmosphere. One or all of these reasons for low light conditions seem to become more important in the Palaeoproterozoic (&amp;lt;2.4 Ga) and could be partly responsible for the more widespread occurrences of shallow marine granular IFs relative to former epochs, which is often assigned to the gradual oxidation of the ocean. Our model shows that variable water transparency should be considered as additional factor for IF deposition especially for shallow marine settings. This model also reasonably explains the prominent layering in BIFs as syn-depositional feature.</description>

      <title>The Geology, Fluid Inclusions, and O&#8208;S Isotopes of the Mibei Gold Deposit, Hunan Province, Southern China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1111/1755-6724.15184</link>
      <description>Wenhao Xue, Yayun Liang, Xiaofeng Li, Minyong Li, Wei Xie, Xue Peng, Rui Xia, Honglin He, Jinzhi Xiao, Acta geologica Sinica/Acta geologica sinica. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4400697833

                Abstract The Mibei gold deposit, located in the southwestern part of the Xuefengshan uplift zone, the middle section of the Jiangnan orogenic belt in southern China, has estimated gold resources of approximately seven tons. This deposit is primarily a quartz vein&#8208;type gold deposit, with ore bodies occurring mainly within Neoproterozoic metasediments. The main metallic minerals in the ore are pyrite, chalcopyrite, and arsenopyrite. In this study, the petrography and microthermometry of ore&#8208;forming fluid inclusions, oxygen isotopes of gold&#8208;bearing quartz, and sulfur isotopes of gold&#8208;bearing sulfides and arsenopyrite were analyzed. Three types of fluid inclusions were identified: type Ia three&#8208;phase inclusions comprising vapor and two phases of liquids (V CO2 + L CO2 + L H2O ), type Ib two&#8208;phase liquids (L CO2 + L H2O ), type II two&#8208;phase vapor&#8208;rich inclusions (V/V + L &gt; 50%), and type III pure liquid inclusions. Type I inclusions were heated uniformly to the liquid phase, type II inclusions were heated uniformly to the gas phase, and type III inclusions were heated without change. In general, the temperature range of homogenization to liquid phase of fluid inclusions in the Mibei gold deposit is 204&#8211;227&#176;C. The salinity of the inclusion ranges from 4.6 to 12.2 wt% NaCl equiv. The &#948; 18 O SMOW of gold&#8208;bearing quartz varies from 16.9&#8240; to 17.5&#8240;. The &#948; 18 O H2O of gold&#8208;bearing quartz are varied from 6.5&#8240; to 7.5&#8240;. The &#948; 34 S values of gold&#8208;bearing pyrite range from 1.7&#8240; to 6.8&#8240;. The &#948; 34 S values of gold&#8208;bearing arsenopyrite range from 5.6&#8240; to 5.9&#8240;. The &#948; 34 S values of pyrite from wall rocks slate range from 6.4&#8240; to 11.6&#8240;. This evidence implies that the ore&#8208;forming fluids of the Mibei gold deposit originated from magmatic&#8208;hydrothermal processes, mixing with minor S from the surrounding metasediments. Combined with the evolution of the Jiangnan orogenic belt, due to the magmatic and tectonic activities of the Xuefengshan uplift during the Caledonian period, the fault seal mechanism controlled the ore&#8208;forming process. Overall, the Mibei gold deposit is more akin to a magmatic&#8208;hydrothermal gold deposit.</description>
