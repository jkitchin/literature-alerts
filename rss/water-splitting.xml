      <title>Localized oxygen evolution and transport analysis in PEM water electrolysis on local static pressure, temperature and current density</title>

                With the escalating severity of the global climate crisis and the strengthening global demand for carbon neutrality, hydrogen produced from renewable energy offers a pathway towards achieving carbon neutrality. To reduce the cost of eco-friendly hydrogen production, we need to increase the current density in proton exchange membrane water electrolysis for green hydrogen production, a promising technology. One problem arising from an increase in current density is that it leads to a significant generation of oxygen, resulting in mass transfer losses. However, there have been few studies on oxygen transport near the anode catalyst layer, with most studies only measuring current density. In this study, local static pressure and temperature were measured in real-time to elucidate the relationship between voltage and current. At 2.1 V (corrected voltage = 2.03 V), the static pressure amplitude is approximately &#8722;5 to 5 kPa. At 2.55 V (correction voltage = 2.41 V), it decreased by about 50 % to about &#8722;2.5 to 2.5 kPa, and the frequency became faster. With increasing voltage, the decrease in static pressure amplitude and the increase in frequency occur because oxygen rapidly increases in the catalyst layer, resulting in a reduction in residence time. At 1.65 V (corrected voltage = 1.63 V), there is little change in local static pressure, indicating the dominance of the liquid single phase. At 3.6 V (corrected voltage = 3.05 V), there is little change in local static pressure. This is due to the rapid detachment of oxygen bubbles, leading to the dominance of the gas single phase. This elucidates how oxygen bubbles are influenced by fluctuations in local static pressure, leading to the conclusion that efficient design patterns for future anode flow fields can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Exploring the interdependence of calcium and chloride activation of O2 evolution in photosystem II</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s11120-024-01094-6</link>
      <description>Alice Haddy, Shilpa Beravolu, John W. Johnston, H. Kern, M. E. McDaniel, Brandon M. Ore, Rick R. Reed, Henry Tai, Photosynthesis research. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396608313

                Abstract Calcium and chloride are activators of oxygen evolution in photosystem II (PSII), the light-absorbing water oxidase of higher plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. Calcium is an essential part of the catalytic Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster that carries out water oxidation and chloride has two nearby binding sites, one of which is associated with a major water channel. The co-activation of oxygen evolution by the two ions is examined in higher plant PSII lacking the extrinsic PsbP and PsbQ subunits using a bisubstrate enzyme kinetics approach. Analysis of three different preparations at pH 6.3 indicates that the Michaelis constant, K M , for each ion is less than the dissociation constant, K S , and that the affinity of PSII for Ca 2+ is about ten-fold greater than for Cl &#8722; , in agreement with previous studies. Results are consistent with a sequential binding model in which either ion can bind first and each promotes the activation by the second ion. At pH 5.5, similar results are found, except with a higher affinity for Cl &#8722; and lower affinity for Ca 2+ . Observation of the slow-decaying Tyr Z radical, Y Z &#8226;, at 77 K and the coupled S 2 Y Z &#8226; radical at 10 K, which are both associated with Ca 2+ depletion, shows that Cl &#8722; is necessary for their observation. Given the order of electron and proton transfer events, this indicates that chloride is required to reach the S 3 state preceding Ca 2+ loss and possibly for stabilization of Y Z &#8226; after it forms. Interdependence through hydrogen bonding is considered in the context of the water environment that intervenes between Cl &#8722; at the Cl&#8722;1 site and the Ca 2+ /Tyr Z region.</description>

      <title>Influence of Water Hardness and Complexing Agents on Electrochemical Hydrogen Peroxide Generation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202400491</link>

                Recently, many studies have been published regarding electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction for generating hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) using gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for various applications. Sodium salts solved in deionized water were usually used as supporting electrolytes. In technical applications, however, tap water&#8208;based electrolytes with hardeners are particularly relevant and have only been considered in a few studies to date. In this work, we investigated the influence of hardeners on H2O2&#8208;generation at 150 mA cm&#8209;2 and were able to show that scaling occurs predominantly on the GDE surface and not in its pore structure. With the novel method in electrochemical synthesis by using complexing agents to bind hardeners, we were able to significantly reduce the scaling. Even after 10 h of operation, the reactor still achieves a faradaic efficiency (FE) of above 70 % (&gt; 67 mg h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2), comparable to the experiments without hardeners and complexing agents in the electrolyte. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the complexing agents are not electrochemically converted at the carbon&#8208;based GDE and behave inertly. If the cell is operated with complexing agents and rinsed with acidic liquid (anolyte) between batches, scaling can be completely avoided.</description>

      <title>Applied electric field induced the change of spin-electron of the Fe3GeTe2 to improve its oxygen evolution reaction performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2024.118310</link>
      <description>Liwei Guo, Rui Wang, Qiuhong Li, Jingguo Hu, Jing Pan, Journal of electroanalytical chemistry. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396621839

                Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigate the influence of the external electric field on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of monolayer Fe3GeTe2. Monolayer Fe3GeTe2 has ferromagnetic metal properties and displays excellent electrocatalytic activity. The magnetism mainly comes from FeI atoms, owing to the strong Fe-Te orbitals hybridization, and FeI atoms have great effect on the active site Te atoms. The electric field induces the change of spin-electron and promotes charge redistribution in the Fe3GeTe2, resulting in the changes of the magnetic moment and magnetic anisotropic energy (MAE). Simultaneously, the applied electric field shifts the energy band and decreases the work function which facilitates carrier migration to the surface. Therefore, the OER overpotential is reduced and the catalytic performance is improved. These valuable findings can serve as vital references for the design of 2D magnetic electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Floret Assembly of NiCo2O4@Tailored Nanostructured Carbon Support for Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Medium</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpcs.2024.112075</link>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a bottleneck in overall water splitting due to the involvement of the four-electron process and requires a high overpotential. This hinders the stability and durability of electrocatalysts over a longer period. Herein, we report flower-like NiCo2O4 decorated on carbon nanostructures synthesized using a one-pot wet chemical method as an OER electrocatalyst in an alkaline medium. The catalytic activities were characterized by various electrochemical measurements including linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and turnover frequency (TOF). 90% NiCo2O4@rGO/f-MWCNT demonstrated a higher OER activity compared to stand-alone NiCo2O4, 90% NiCo2O4@rGO, 90% NiCo2O4@f-MWCNT and 80% NiCo2O4@rGO/f-MWCNT.</description>

                COVID-19 is an emerging viral infectious disease. Severe respiratory problems are considered an important syndrome of COVID-19 in humans. Levofloxacin (LEV), a promising fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent/therapeutic agent for influenza virus (H1N1)-induced pneumonia drug. These have been used as a potent antidote for acute respiratory tract infections. Owing to its excellent pharmacokinetic properties such as potential antiviral and scavenging activity, LEV has been used in controlling and treating COVID-19 during infectious emergencies. Even taking over the dosage of LEV and disposing of the embryonic toxic nature of LEV residues in the pharmaceutical research industry can cause adverse effects on the public health and environment. For this purpose, the development of great analytical tools is important to the detection of antiviral LEV for human health safety and environmental protection. In this work, we report a nitrogen (N) doped strategy to construct the enriched oxygen vacancies (OVs) on CeO2-xNx/GCN-2 hybrid nanostructure as an efficient electrocatalyst for the ultrasensitive detection of antiviral LEV. The effect of the N doping into the CeO2 (CeO2-xNx) lattice with increasing the large amount of OVs and boosted their redox properties (Ce4+&#8594;Ce3+), thus provided that a great electrochemically active site. Although the abundant OVs were conformed on the CeO2-xNx/GCN-2 from the peak-area ratio of Ce3+/Ce4+ and O2/O1 by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) assay. Owing to the strong electronic coupling between the OV-rich CeO2-xNx and the conductive GCN surface, thus CeO2-xNx/GCN-2 heterojunction achieved superior analytical performance for LEV oxidation with a good linear range from 0.01 &#956;M to 710 &#956;M, and detection limits of 5.6 nM (S/N = 3), and sensitivity 24.711&#956;A &#956;M&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at a very low working potential (0.7 V). The proposed hybrid sensor also exploited to the analysis of the pharmaceutical industry wastewater, pharmaceutical tablet and human urine samples with a satisfactory recovery rate.</description>

                The strategy of generating sustainable energy with hydrogen fuel is highly significant and promising. Hydrogen fuel being non-toxic proves beneficial for the environment and can be produced in a variety of ways, as industrial water splitting into oxygen and hydrogen is a crucial future plan. This study aims to investigate cerium-based chalcogens (CeS, CeSe, and CeTe), as a catalyst to broaden the family of highly effective OER electrocatalysts based on transition metal chalcogenides. CeTe on NF was found to exhibit lowest onset potential with an overpotential of 333 mV at 10 mAcm&#8722;2 and a 51 mVdec&#8722;1 Tafel value among CeE (E = S, Se) chalcogenides with comparable stoichiometry. Using different analyses, it was determined that CeTe had a large surface area of 83.7 m2g-1, a cubic structure, and a highly crystalline nanoflakes morphology. High electrochemical surface area of 562 cm2, small resistance as Rs of 1.12 &#937;, and Rct 729 m&#937;, along with high TOF value of 0.174 s&#8722;1, 0.059 s&#8722;1, 0.009 s&#8722;1 for CeTe as compared to CeSe and CeS have supported by CV results. In particular, CeTe showed exceptional catalytic efficiency and was highly active and durable in oxygen evolution reactions.</description>

                Single phase Mn rich Mn1-x RuxO2 conforming a highly disordered &#947; MnO2 with pyrolusite-like blocks dominating in the structure were prepared for low Ru content (0.15 &#8805; x &#8805; 0.30). All synthesized materials were electrochemically active in oxygen and chlorine evolution reactions in acidic conditions while varying the content of chlorides. The total activity increased with increasing Ru content in the structure as well as increasing concentration of chlorides in the solution. The selectivity towards oxygen evolution reaction was predominant for all chloride concentrations (from 0.02 to 0.3M), and its value was not dependent on the total Ru content in the material structure. The reaction mechanism with respect to chlorine evolution reaction was discussed on the basis of the determined order of reactions, which apparently increased with increasing Ru content.</description>

      <title>Double oxygen evolution co-catalysts modified BiVO4 to boost photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance</title>

                Improving the kinetics of oxygen evolution is crucial for enhancing the performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Herein, this study utilizes a chemical self-growth method to grow NiFe tannic acid complex (NFTA) and Co(OH)2 on the surface of BiVO4 photoanode (BiVO4/NFTA/Co). As a result, the synergistic effects of NFTA and Co(OH)2 layers promote the efficiency and stability of BiVO4 photoanode towards PEC water oxidation. The photocurrent density of the obtained BiVO4/NFTA/Co photoanode reaches 4.97 mA cm-2, which is significantly greater than those of BiVO4/NFTA (4.36 mA cm-2), BiVO4/Co (2.51 mA cm-2), BiVO4 (1.34 mA cm-2), respectively. Detailed analysis confirms that NFTA could provide an efficient way to hasten the transfer of photo-generated holes on the photoanode surface and diminish the surface charge transfer resistance. In other hand, Co(OH)2 could be served as a cocatalyst to accelerate charge transfer for efficient oxygen evolution reaction as well as a protective layer to maintain the long-term stability of NFTA on the surface of BiVO4 during water oxidation. Such double oxygen evolution co-catalysts decoration strategy paves an effective pathway to enhance the PEC water oxidation performance of BiVO4 photoanode.</description>

                In this study, nickel ferrite (NiFe 2 O 4 ) nanoparticles were synthesized using the hydrothermal method at various pH values. The objective was to investigate the influence of pH variation on particle size and electrocatalytic activity. The formation of cubic phase nanoparticles was confirmed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. To characterize the electrochemical properties, the nickel ferrite nanoparticles were coated onto a stainless steel substrate using the doctor blade technique. The microstructural analysis was conducted using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The samples were further analyzed using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The average crystallite size, determined from the XRD pattern, was approximately 40 nm. SEM images revealed a conversion from nanoplates to a granular morphology. The synthesized electrode exhibited an overpotential of 392 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 and demonstrated good stability for 5 hours. These findings highlight the excellent electrocatalytic activity of nickel ferrite nanoparticles for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).</description>

                Because of its low thermodynamic voltage, the electrocatalytic urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is an effective way to replace the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and address the issue of urea-rich water pollution. Herein, we have synthesized MoSe2&#8211;NiWSe2 with spherical nanoflower structure consisting of MoSe2 nanosheets and NiWSe2 nanosheets crisscrossed longitudinally and transversely. The results show that the prepared MoSe2&#8211;NiWSe2 has a significant competitive advantage in the UOR and OER. With 10 mA cm&#8722;2, a mere 200 mV overpotential was required, indicating high OER catalytic activity. MoSe2&#8211;NiWSe2-driven UOR might operate at a comparatively low potential of 1.36 V (10 mA cm&#8722;2). The overpotential did not significantly alter after 40 h of continuous operation, suggesting it possesses high UOR stability. A built-in electric field that aids in controlling the adsorption and oriented distribution of urea molecules and thus promotes the oxidative properties of water and urea forms at the interface of MoSe2 and NiWSe2, where the difference in electronegativity between the elements Mo and Ni induces self-driven charge transfer and interfacial coupling effects. This work offers a method for creating catalysts that produce more oxygen and clean up urea-rich water contamination.</description>

      <title>Regulating the electronic state of SnO2@NiFe-LDH heterojunction: Activating lattice oxygen for efficient oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fuel.2024.131762</link>
      <description>Chaojie Yin, Fanghe Zhou, Chunliang Ding, Shengde Jin, Rui Zhu, J. Wu, Wenhao Li, Yang Wu, Jia Lin, Xiaoxun Ma, Jie Deng, Zhongjun Zhao, Fuel. 370(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396633891

                In Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), catalysts with lattice oxygen, utilizing the Lattice Oxygen Mechanism (LOM), directly participate in oxygen evolution, effectively reducing activation energy. NiFe-Layered Double Hydroxides (NiFe-LDHs), rich in surface hydroxyls, are potential for LOM. However, their stability is challenged in alkaline conditions due to metal cation dissolution from the lattice, limiting catalytic efficiency. In this work, we modify NiFe-LDH by combining hydrothermal and electrodeposition techniques, coupling NiFe-LDH with the metal oxide SnO2. This process creates a heterojunction enriched with oxygen vacancies through interfacial and defect engineering. In 1 M KOH solution, this modified catalyst exhibits an OER overpotential of just 209 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, when the current density is increased to 100 mA cm&#8722;2, the overpotential only increases by a modest 46 mV. Subsequent DFT investigations reveal that in the heterostructured system, there is an enhanced overlap between the O 2p and metal 3d orbitals, which optimizes the covalency of the metal&#8211;oxygen bond and promotes the participation of lattice oxygen in the reduction reaction. The heterojunction, in concert with oxygen vacancies, aligns the energy bands of oxygen and metal closer to the Fermi level, resulting in improved continuity of electronic orbitals near the Fermi level. This synergistic arrangement significantly reduces the energy barrier for the rate-determining step of the OER, substantiating the improved performance and activation of lattice oxygen.</description>

      <title>Anion Structure Regulation of Cobalt Silicate Hydroxide Endowing Boosted Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                Abstract Transition metal silicates (TMSs) are attempted for the electrocatalyst of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their special layered structure in recent years. However, defects such as low theoretical activity and conductivity limit their application. Researchers always prefer to composite TMSs with other functional materials to make up for their deficiency, but rarely focus on the effect of intrinsic structure adjustment on their catalytic activity, especially anion structure regulation. Herein, applying the method of interference hydrolysis and vacancy reserve, new silicate vacancies (anionic regulation) are introduced in cobalt silicate hydroxide (CoSi), named SV&#8208;CoSi, to enlarge the number and enhance the activity of catalytic sites. The overpotential of SV&#8208;CoSi declines to 301 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 compared to 438 mV of CoSi. Source of such improvement is verified to be not only the increase of active sites, but also the positive effect on the intrinsic activity due to the enhancement of cobalt&#8208;oxygen covalence with the variation of anion structure by density functional theory (DFT) method. This work demonstrates that the feasible intrinsic anion structure regulation can improve OER performance of TMSs and provides an effective idea for the development of non&#8208;noble metal catalyst for OER.</description>

                A significant challenge in direct seawater electrolysis is the rapid deactivation of the cathode due to the large scaling of Mg(OH)2. Herein, we synthesized a Pt-coated highly disordered NiCu alloy (Pt-NiCu alloy) electrode with superior solidophobic behavior, enabling stable hydrogen generation (100 mA cm&#8211;2, &gt;1000 h durability) and simultaneous production of Mg(OH)2 (&gt;99.0% purity) in electrolyte enriched with Mg2+ and Ca2+. The unconventional solidophobic property primarily stems from the high surface energy of the NiCu alloy substrate, which facilitates the adsorption of surface water and thereby compels the bulk formation of Mg(OH)2 via homogeneous nucleation. The discovery of this solidophobic electrode will revolutionarily simplify the existing techniques for seawater electrolysis and increase the economic viability for seawater electrolysis.</description>

                The development of affordable, highly active, and stable trifunctional electrocatalysts is imperative for sustainable energy applications such as overall water splitting and rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery. Herein, we report a composite electrocatalyst with RuSe2 and CoSe2 hybrid nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped carbon (RuSe2CoSe2/NC) synthesized through a carbonization&#8211;adsorption&#8211;selenylation strategy. This electrocatalyst is a trifunctional electrocatalyst with excellent hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities. An in-depth study of the effect of Se on the electrocatalytic process was conducted. Notably, the incorporation of Se moderately adjusted electronic structure of Ru and Co, enhancing all three types of catalytic performance (HER, &#951;10 = 31 mV; OER, &#951;10 = 248 mV; ORR, E1/2 = 0.834 V) under alkaline condition with accelerated kinetics and improved stability. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals that the (210) crystal facet of RuSe2 is the dominant HER active site as it exhibited the lowest &#916;GH* value. The in situ Raman spectra unravel the evolution process of the local electronic environment of Co&#8211;Se and Ru&#8211;Se bonds, which synergistically promotes the formation of CoOOH as the active intermediate during the OER. The superior catalytic efficiency and remarkable durability of RuSe2CoSe2/NC as an electrode for water splitting and zinc&#8211;air battery devices demonstrate its great potential for energy storage and conversion devices.</description>

                Abstract The design of high&#8208;energy facets in electrocatalysts has attracted significant attention due to their potential to enhance electrocatalytic activity. In this review, the significance of high&#8208;energy facets in various electrochemical reactions are highlighted, including oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR), and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CRR). Their importance in various electrochemical reactions and present strategies for constructing high&#8208;energy facets are discussed, including alloying, heterostructure formation, selective etching, capping agents, and coupling with substrates. These strategies enable control over crystallographic orientation and surface morphology, fine&#8208;tuning electrocatalytic properties. This study also addresses future directions and challenges, emphasizing the need to better understand fundamental mechanisms. Overall, high&#8208;energy facets offer exciting opportunities for advancing electrocatalysis.</description>

                PEMWE is considered a promising technology for coupling with renewable energy sources to achieve clean hydrogen production. However, constrained by the sluggish kinetics of the anodic OER and the acidic abominable environment render the grand challenges in developing the active and stable OER electrocatalyst, leading to low efficiency of PEMWE. Herein, we develop the rutile&#8208;type IrO2 nanoparticles with abundant grain boundaries and the continuous nanostructure through the joule heating and sacrificial template method. DFT calculations verified that grain boundaries can modulate the electronic structure of Ir sites and optimize the adsorption of oxygen intermediates, resulting in the accelerated kinetics. The 350&#8208;IrO2 affords a rapid OER process with 20 times higher mass activity (0.61 A mgIr&#8208;1) than the commercial IrO2 at 1.50 V vs. RHE. Benefiting from the reduced overpotential and the preservation of the stable rutile structure, 350&#8208;IrO2 exhibits the stability of 200 h test at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 with only trace decay of 11.8 mV. Moreover, the assembled PEMWE with anode 350&#8208;IrO2 catalyst outputs the current density up to 2 A cm&#8208;2 with only 1.84 V applied voltage, long&#8208;term operation for 100 h without obvious performance degradation at 1 A cm&#8208;2.</description>

      <title>Dual Doping of B and Fe Activated Lattice Oxygen Participation for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity in Alkaline Freshwater and Seawater</title>

                Abstract The exploitation of highly activity oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is critical for the application of electrocatalytic water splitting. Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is expected to provide a promising pathway to overcome the sluggish OER kinetics, however, effectively enhancing the involvement of lattice oxygen remains challenging. In this study, the fabrication of B, Fe co&#8208;doped CoP (B, Fe&#9472;CoP) nanofibers is reported, which serve as highly efficient OER electrocatalyst through phosphorization and boronation treatment of Fe&#8208;doped Co 3 O 4 nanofibers. Experimental results combined with theoretical calculations reveal that simultaneous incorporation of both B and Fe can more effectively trigger the participation of lattice oxygen in CoFe oxyhydroxides reconstructed from B, Fe&#9472;CoP nanofibers compared to incorporating only B or Fe. Therefore, the optimized B, Fe&#9472;CoP nanofibers exhibit superb OER activity with low overpotentials of 361 and 376 mV at 1000 mA cm &#8722;2 in alkaline freshwater and alkaline natural seawater, respectively. The present work provides significant guidelines and innovative design concepts for the development of OER electrocatalysts following the LOM pathway.</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) has emerged as a kind of multi&#8208;functional green oxidants with extensive industrial utility. Oxidized carbon materials exhibit promises as electrocatalysts in the two&#8208;electron (2e &#8722; ) oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for H 2 O 2 production. However, the precise identification and fabrication of active sites that selectively yield H 2 O 2 present a serious challenge. Herein, a structural engineering strategy is employed to synthesize oxygen&#8208;doped carbon quantum dots (o&#8208;CQD) for the 2e &#8722; ORR. The surface electronic structure of the o&#8208;CQDs is systematically modulated by varying isomerization precursors, thereby demonstrating excellent electrocatalyst performance. Notably, o&#8208;CQD&#8208;3 emerges as the most promising candidate, showcasing a remarkable H 2 O 2 selectivity of 96.2% (n = 2.07) at 0.68 V versus RHE, coupled with a low Tafel diagram of 66.95 mV dec &#8722;1 . In the flow cell configuration, o&#8208;CQD&#8208;3 achieves a H 2 O 2 productivity of 338.7 mmol g catalyst &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 , maintaining consistent production stability over an impressive 120&#8208;hour duration. Utilizing in situ technology and density functional theory calculations, it is unveil that edge sites of o&#8208;CQD&#8208;3 are facilely functionalized by C&#8208;O&#8208;C groups under alkaline ORR conditions. This isomerization engineering approach advances the forefront of sustainable catalysis and provides a profound insight into the carbon&#8208;based catalyst design for environmental&#8208;friendly chemical synthesis processes.</description>

                Climate change is showing its impacts now more than ever. The intense use of fossil fuels and the resulting CO 2 emissions are mainly to blame, accentuating the need to develop further the available energy conversion and storage technologies, which are regarded as effective solutions to maximize the use of intermittent renewable energy sources and reduce global CO 2 emissions. This work comprehensively overviews the most recent progress and trends in the use of transition metal-based electrocatalysts for three crucial reactions in electrochemical energy conversion and storage, namely, the oxygen evolution (OER), oxygen reduction (ORR), and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions. By analyzing the state-of-the-art polyoxometalates (POMs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), the performance of these two promising types of materials for OER, ORR, and HER is compared to that of more traditional transition metal oxides and alloy-based electrocatalysts. Both catalytic activity and stability are highly influenced by the adsorption energies of the intermediate species formed in each reaction, which are very sensitive to changes in the microstructure and chemical microenvironment. POMs and MOFs allow these aspects to be easily modified to fine-tune the catalytic performances. Therefore, their chemical tunability and versatility make it possible to tailor such properties to obtain higher electrocatalytic activities, or even to obtain derived materials with more compelling properties towards these reactions.</description>

                The phenomenon of friction increase in graphene coatings during prolonged treatment in an oxygen plasma environment has been widely recognized. In this study, we report a newly discovered oxidation state that leads to decreased friction during oxygen plasma treatment of vacancy graphene and propose a simple, clean, and efficient method for the controlled oxidation. Through density-functional theory calculations, we suggest the possibility of evolution from vacancies to oligo-oxygen and poly-oxygen structures during the oxygen plasma treatment, confirming sequential friction decrease and increase. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the oligo-oxygen structure exhibits excellent in-plane stiffness in addition to low surface friction, making it an ideal friction interface. Notably, conditional friction can induce the reverse evolution of the poly-oxygen structures back to the oligo-oxygen structures. Experimental results demonstrate that the friction of oligo-oxygen and poly-oxygen structures decreased by 30.6% and increased by 130.1%, respectively, compared to the initial graphene vacancy structures. Moreover, the induced friction by 0.1 N in the presence of hydrogen makes the friction performance of the induced poly-oxygen structures, especially in the initial friction phase, almost comparable to that of the oligo-oxygen structures. These findings reveal the structural evolution and reverse evolution laws of graphene coatings in high-energy oxygen plasma environments, which are of great significance for the lubrication of moving component devices in the oxygen plasma environment, including in the plasma industry and space.</description>

                Abstract The sluggish kinetics for anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and insufficient catalytic performance over the corresponding Ir&#8208;based catalysts are still enormous challenges in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer (PEMWE). Herein, we report that KIr 4 O 8 nanowires anode catalyst with more exposed active sites and rich hydroxyl achieves a current density of 1.0 A/cm 2 at 1.68 V and possesses excellent catalytic stability with 1230 h in PEMWE. Combining in situ Raman spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectroscopy results, we propose the modified adsorbate evolution mechanism that rich hydroxyl in the inherent structure of KIr 4 O 8 nanowires directly participates in the catalytic process for favoring the OER. Density functional theory calculation results further suggest that the enhanced proximity between Ir ( d ) and O ( p ) band center in KIr 4 O 8 can strengthen the covalence of Ir&#8208;O, facilitate the electron transfer between adsorbents and active sites, and decrease the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step from OH * to O * during the OER.

      <title>Boron-incorporated IrO2-Ta2O5 coating as an efficient electrocatalyst for acidic oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                The Ir-based electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) have demonstrated remarkable durability. Enhancing the Ir-based electrocatalytic activity still remains crucial owing to the scarcity of iridium. Here, a high-temperature sintering technique is employed to fabricate a boron (B)-incorporated IrO2-Ta2O5 coating with an almost perfect rutile-type crystal structure on a corrosion-resistant titanium substrate, ensuring exceptional stability for the acidic OER. The B-incorporated IrO2-Ta2O5 electrode fabricated in a mixed solution of 0.6 M H3BO3, exhibits an overpotential of 210 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a lower Tafel slope of 34.2 mV dec&#8722;1 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, which is far lower than the 272 mV overpotential and the 45.3 mV dec&#8722;1 of the IrO2-Ta2O5/Ti electrode. The electrode possesses a minimal potential increase even after undergoing continuous OER for 400 h at a high current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. The incorporation of B species into IrO2-Ta2O5 effectively fine-tunes the electronic structure of Ir active sites, leading to a substantial enhancement of the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. This study provides promising prospects for reducing the energy consumption of noble IrO2-based electrocatalysts in the practical application of electrochemical industry for the acidic OER.</description>

      <title>Ge&#8208;Doped Hematite with FeCoNi&#8208;B&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; as Cocatalyst for High&#8208;Performing Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>

                Abstract Hematite is a promising photoanode material for photoelectrochemical water&#8208;splitting technology. However, the low current density associated with the low conductivity, low charge carrier mobility, and poor oxygen evolution catalytic activity is a challenging issue for the material. In this study, the challenge is addressed by introducing Germanium (Ge) doping, coupled with the use of FeCoNi&#8208;B i as a co&#8208;catalyst. Ge doping not only increases the conductivity and charge carrier concentration of the hematite photoanode, but also induces nanopores, thereby expanding its electrochemical reactive surface area to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction. In the meantime, the FeCoNi&#8208;B i cocatalyst electrodeposited onto the surface of Ge&#8208;doped hematite, improves the oxygen evolution reaction performance. As a result, the obtained photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 2.31 mA cm &#8722;2 at 1.23 V RHE , which is three times higher than that of hematite (0.72 mA cm &#8722;2 ). Moreover, a new analytical method is introduced to scrutinize both the positive and negative effects of Ge doping and FeCoNi&#8208;B i cocatalyst on the photoanode performance by decoupling the photoelectrochemical process steps. Overall, this study not only enhances the performance of hematite photoanodes but also guides their rational design and systematic assessment.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure Tailoring of Cuco2o4 for Boosting Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>

                Electronic structure tuning in metal oxides is a facile and effective strategy on boosting their catalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Here, we demonstrate the electronic structure tuning of CuCo2O4 by phosphorus (P) doping via in-situ diffusion method. The results found that due to more electrons transferred from P to the neighboring Co3+, the tuned Co was served as OER active sites, which contributes to an extraordinary OER performance. The synthesized P3.85-CCO/NF exhibits an overpotential of 250 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm-2, and a Tafel slope of 27 mV dec-1, which performs an enhanced OER activity than that of IrO2/NF. Moreover, the P3.85-CCO/NF presents stable electrochemical performances upon long-time running for 30 h. Thus, the electronic structure tuning strategy by in-situ P diffusion method emerges as an effective approach on enhancing the catalytic OER performance for metal oxide electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Chemical etching to boost medium-entropy metal oxide for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jelechem.2024.118318</link>
      <description>Shaofu Kuang, Honglin Zhang, Liwen Zhou, Zugao Pi, Hua Lin, Ming Nie, Junhui Sun, Qing Li, Journal of electroanalytical chemistry. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396621685

                It is crucial to improve the catalytic activity of medium-entropy materials by adjusting the surface electronic structure of medium-entropy materials. In this research, we utilize a chemical etching method for synthesizing a medium-entropy metal oxide E-FeCoNiZn with abundant defects. Owing to the etching of Zn, a special form of electron-transfer by means of electron-accepting-donating is introduced, which greatly optimizes OER activity. The E-FeCoNiZn displays a superior OER activity with a low overpotential of 259 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a small Tafel slope of 37.1 mV dec-1 in 1 M KOH solution, outperforming the performance of FeCoNiZn and Ni-foam, while maintaining excellent stability over 48 h. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the introduction of defects regulates the surface electronic structure of the E-FeCoNiZn via modifying the number of electrons transferred and then optimize the OER activity. This work provides a new strategy for designing medium-entropy materials possessing high catalytic activity.</description>

      <title>Microstructure and Texture Evolution in Cold-Rolled and Annealed Oxygen-Free Copper Sheets</title>

                Commercial oxygen-free copper sheets were cold-rolled with reduction rates ranging from 20% to 87% and annealed at 400, 500 and 600 &#176;C. The microstructure and texture evolution during the cold-rolling and annealing processes were studied using optical microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD). The results show that the deformation textures of {123}&lt;634&gt; (S), {112}&lt;111&gt; (Copper) and {110}&lt;112&gt; (Brass) were continuously enhanced with the increase in cold-rolling reduction. The orientations along the &#945;-oriented fiber converged towards Brass, and the orientation density of &#946; fiber obviously increased when the rolling reduction exceeded 60%. The recrystallization texture was significantly affected by the cold-rolling reduction. After 60% cold-rolling reduction, Copper and S texture components gradually decreased, and the {011}&lt;511&gt; recrystallization texture component formed with the increase in annealing temperature. After 87% cold-rolling reduction, a strong Cube texture formed, and other textures were inhibited with the increase in annealing temperature. The strong Brass and S deformation texture was conducive to the formation of a strong Cube annealing texture. The density of the annealing twin boundary decreased with the increase in annealing temperature, and more annealing twin boundaries formed in the oxygen-free copper sheets with the increase in cold-rolling reduction.</description>

Here, we report on the preparation of growing Ni(OH)2 nanosheets in situ on a Ni and graphene hybrid using supergravity electrodeposition and the hydrothermal method. The obtained catalyst displays outstanding performance with small overpotentials of 161.7 and 41 mV to acquire current densities of 100 and 10 mA cm&#8722;2 on hydrogen evolution reaction, overpotentials of 407 and 331 mV to afford 100 and 50 mA cm&#8722;2 on oxygen evolution reaction, and 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at a cell voltage of 1.43 V for water splitting in 1 M KOH. The electrochemical activity of the catalyst is higher than most of the earth-abundant materials reported to date, which is mainly due to its special hierarchical structure, large surface area, and good electrical conductivity. This study provides new tactics for enhancing the catalytic performance of water electrolysis.</description>

                Abstract Although zinc&#8210;air batteries (ZABs) are regarded as one of the most prospective energy storage devices, their practical application has been restricted by poor air electrode performance. Herein, we developed a free&#8208;standing air electrode that is fabricated on the basis of a multifunctional three&#8208;dimensional interconnected graphene network. Specifically, a three&#8208;dimensional interconnected graphene network with fast mass and electron transport ability, prepared by catalyzing growth of graphene foam on nickel foam and then filling reduced graphene oxide into the pores of graphene foam, is used to anchor iron phthalocyanine molecules with atomic Fe&#8210;N 4 sites for boosting the oxygen reduction during discharging and nanosized FeNi hydroxides for accelerating the oxygen evolution during charging. As a result, the obtained air electrode exhibited an ultra&#8208;small electrocatalytic overpotential of 0.603 V for oxygen reactions, a high peak power density of 220.2 mW cm &#8210;2 , and a small and stable charge&#8210;discharge voltage gap of 0.70 V at 10 mA cm &#8210;2 after 1136 cycles. Furthermore, in situ Raman spectroscopy together with theoretical calculations confirmed that phase transformation of FeNi hydroxides takes place from &#945;&#8208;Ni(OH) x to &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH) x to &#947;&#8208;Ni (3+&#948;)+ OOH for the oxygen evolution reaction and Ni is the active center while Fe enhances the activity of Ni active sites.</description>

                This study introduces an innovative approach to enhance cathodic CO2 reduction on the working side by focusing on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the counter side. Maintaining an inert atmosphere on the counter side led to a significant improvement in CO faradaic efficiency from 65% to 95%. BiVO4 on FTO proved to be resistant to oxygen poisoning when used as photoanode. Additionally, investigations into the stability of [AgSePh]&#8734; reveal insights into its behaviour under elevated potential and surrounding electrolyte, suggesting weakening Ag-Se bonds and the release of benzeneselenol upon charge accumulation within the first 2 hours before producing CO in a stable manner for 16 hours. Overall, this research significantly contributes to electrocatalytic CO2 reduction, offering innovative pathways for catalyst development and optimization.</description>

                The Ti/Mn2O3-Co3O4 coating anodes synthesized via thermal decomposition, and their phase and morphology were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). Electrochemical tests, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), were conducted in a MnSO4 solution. Results indicated that the Ti/Mn2O3-Co3O4 anode with 10 mol% Co showed the best performance with a significantly higher voltammetric charge and a lower overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to Ti/Mn2O3 coating anode. The Co-Mn synergy enhanced oxygen adsorption on the anode surface, thereby improving OER electrochemical performance of Ti/Mn2O3-Co3O4 coating anodes. In addition, the Ti/Mn2O3-Co3O4 coating anode had a voltammetric charge 21 times higher than Pb-Ag alloy anodes.</description>

                Developing efficient, economical, and resource-abundant dual-function electrocatalysts for water splitting is crucial. In this study, uniform growth of NiSex nanocrystals on Fe-doped XC-72 carbon (NS/XC-Fe) was achieved through a solvothermal method, resulting in the formation of a composite material with outstanding performance. NS/XC-Fe exhibits excellent catalytic performance for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (261 mV, 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (275 mV, 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2) under alkaline conditions, owing to the introduction of iron and the construction of heterogeneous interfaces. Additionally, NS/XC-Fe exhibited excellent stability during the 24 h polarization test. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the introduction of iron optimized the catalyst's H adsorption capability, while the construction of heterogeneous interfaces lowered the energy barrier of the rate-determining step. This demonstrates the significant potential of NS/XC-Fe as an electrocatalyst, providing new insights for the design and synthesis of efficient bifunctional electrochemical water splitting catalysts.</description>

      <title>Enhanced electro-catalytic activity of TNTs/SnO2-Sb electrode through the effect mechanism of TNTs architecture</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/s1872-5813(23)60390-1</link>
      <description>Lisha Yang, GUO Yanming, Journal of fuel chemistry &amp; technology. 52(5)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396626888

                The TiO2 nanotubes arrays/SnO2-Sb (TNTs/SnO2-Sb) electrode is successfully fabricated using the solvothermal synthesis technique. Various architectures of TNTs are constructed by varying the anodization voltage and time, aiming to investigate their impact on the structural and electrochemical properties of the SnO2-Sb electrode. The anodization voltage is identified as the primary influencing factor on the morphology and surface hydrophilia of TNTs arrays, which is evidenced by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and contact angle testing. In contrast, the effect of anodization time is relatively small. SEM, X-ray diffraction (XRD), linear sweep voltammograms (LSV), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) results indicate that the morphology and crystal size of the catalytic coating, as well as the oxygen evolution potential of the electrode, are influenced by the pore size of TNTs arrays. The influencing mechanism of enhanced electrochemical activity by adjusting the architecture of TNTs arrays is investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and hydroxyl radicals (&#183;OH) generation test. The results reveal a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies on the sample with a compact and smaller particle coating, indicating the presence of more adsorbed oxygen species. Consequently, this enhances the generation capacity of active radicals for organic matter degradation. The electrode featuring TNTs arrays with a length of 950 nm and a pore diameter of 100 nm exhibits the most effective remediation of phenol-containing wastewater, achieving approximately 92% &#177; 4.6% removal after a duration of 2 h.</description>

      <title>Shape&#8211;Preserved CoFeNi&#8211;MOF/NF Exhibiting Superior Performance for Overall Water Splitting across Alkaline and Neutral Conditions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/ma17102195</link>
      <description>Yu Liu, Panpan Li, Zegao Wang, Liangjuan Gao, Materials. 17(10)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396691543

                This study reported a multi&#8211;functional Co0.45Fe0.45Ni0.9&#8211;MOF/NF catalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and overall water splitting, which was synthesized via a novel shape&#8211;preserving two&#8211;step hydrothermal method. The resulting bowknot flake structure on NF enhanced the exposure of active sites, fostering a superior electrocatalytic surface, and the synergistic effect between Co, Fe, and Ni enhanced the catalytic activity of the active site. In an alkaline environment, the catalyst exhibited impressive overpotentials of 244 mV and 287 mV at current densities of 50 mA cm&#8722;2 and 100 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. Transitioning to a neutral environment, an overpotential of 505 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 was achieved with the same catalyst, showing a superior property compared to similar catalysts. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Co0.45Fe0.45Ni0.9&#8211;MOF/NF shows versatility as a bifunctional catalyst, excelling in both OER and HER, as well as overall water splitting. The innovative shape&#8211;preserving synthesis method presented in this study offers a facile method to develop an efficient electrocatalyst for OER under both alkaline and neutral conditions, which makes it a promising catalyst for hydrogen production by water splitting.</description>

      <title>Achieving Visible Light Triggered Overall Water Splitting over Plasmonic Au/SrTiO3:Al Photocatalyst</title>

                The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect has garnered extensive attention in semiconductor photocatalysis for solar energy conversion, thanks to its remarkable optical properties. However, the majority SPR&#8208;induced photocatalytic systems have been limited to achieving hydrogen evolution or oxygen evolution half reactions, and attaining overall water splitting on a SPR&#8208;induced photocatalyst under visible light remains a formidable challenging. In this study, we employed a plasmonic photocatalyst Au/SrTiO3, and further enhanced its performance by doping aluminum (Al) into the SrTiO3 lattice (denoted as Au/SrTiO3:Al). By constructing reduction cocatalyst (RhCrOx) and oxidation cocatalyst (CoOOH), the Au/SrTiO3:Al photocatalyst successfully realizes photocatalytic overall water splitting with a stoichiometric ratio of H2 and O2 under visible light (&#955; &#8805; 440 nm). We revealed that the introduction of Al species effectively modified the electronic structure of SrTiO3, thereby enhancing the hydrogen evolution reaction in Au/SrTiO3:Al. Simultaneously, the RhCrOx and CoOOH cocatalysts synergistically capitalized on the short&#8208;lived hot electrons and holes generated by the plasmonic Au/SrTiO3:Al photocatalyst, enabling to realize photocatalytic overall water splitting. This work offers a promising avenue for the rational design of plasmon&#8208;induced overall water splitting photocatalysts through the integration of suitable cocatalysts and surface/interface engineering strategies.</description>

                Abstract The pursuit of high energy densities propels the design of next&#8208;generation nickel&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes. The utilization of low&#8208;cobalt, ultrahigh&#8208;nickel layered oxide cathodes, and the extension of operating voltages promise enhanced energy density. However, stability and safety face challenges associated with nickel content, including structural degradation, lattice oxygen evolution, and thermal instability. In this study, a promising strategy of Al and Nb dual&#8208;bulk&#8208;doping is presented in high&#8208;Ni cathode materials of LiNi 0.96 Co 0.04 O 2 (NC) to stabilize the bulk structure, suppress oxygen release, and attain superior electrochemical performance at high voltages. The introduction of Al and Nb effectively raises the migration energy of Ni 2+ into Li sites and stabilizes lattice oxygen through strengthened Al&#9472;O and Nb&#9472;O bonds. Furthermore, the substitution of high&#8208;valence Nb ions reduces the charge depletion of lattice oxygen and induces an ordered microstructure. The Al and Nb dual&#8208;bulk&#8208;doping strategy mitigates strain and stress associated with the H2&#8596;H3 phase transition, reducing the generation and propagation of microcracks. The resulting Li(Ni 0.96 Co 0.04 ) 0.985 Al 0.01 Nb 0.005 O 2 (NCAN) cathode exhibits superior cycling stability, with a capacity retention of 77.8% after 300 cycles, even when operating at a high&#8208;voltage of 4.4 V, outperforming the NC (48.5%). This work provides a promising perspective for developing high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;Ni cathode materials.</description>

                Efficient and affordable electrocatalysts are a crucial part of rechargeable zinc air batteries (ZAB) to address the problems caused by the sluggish activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the cathode. Anchoring noble metals on transition-metal-based substances is a promising strategy to reinforce electrochemical activity and reduce the cost. Herein, we have developed a subsequent spontaneous-redox strategy to load Pt nanoparticles with 3.75% containing NiFe-LDH nanoflakes to boost the ORR activity. After that, NiFe-LDH@ Co9S8 is constructed as a rational design for bifunction catalysis. In the ORR process, the half-wave potential of the obtained catalyst, Pt-anchored NiFe-LDH@Co9S8, is 0.83 V vs RHE, showing better catalytic activity than Pt/C. In the OER process, the obtained catalyst exhibits a low overpotential of 280 mV, which is superior to that of RuO2. Notably, aqueous ZAB and quasi-solid-state ZAB achieve peak power densities of 164.3 and 78.4 mW cm&#8211;2, respectively. Furthermore, quasi-solid-state ZAB exhibits a long cycle lifespan for 240 cycles in 80 h, and a remarkable stability after bending for 50 cycles. This work paves the way for the design of the NiFe-LDH nanostructure by vacancy engineering.</description>

                Abstract Electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) stands out as an economical and prospective technology to replace oxygen evolution reaction for co&#8208;producing high&#8208;valued chemicals and hydrogen (H 2 ). Regulating the adsorption of glycerol (GLY) and hydroxyl (OH) species is of great significance for improving the GOR performance. Herein, a hierarchical p&#8211;n heterojunction by combining Co&#8208;metal organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with CuO nanorod arrays (CuO@Co&#8208;MOF) is developed to realize the optimization on GOR. Specifically, CuO@Co&#8208;MOF electrode exhibits superior performance with a conversion of 98.4%, formic acid (FA) selectivity of 87.3%, and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 98.9%. The flow&#8208;cell system with the bifunctional CuO@Co&#8208;MOF electrode for pairing GOR with the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reveals better energy conversion efficiency. Experimental results and theoretical calculations unravel the redistributed electric field by introducing Co&#8208;containing species that contribute to the improved performance, which not only enhances the OH adsorption but also modulates the excessive GLY adsorption of CuO, thus reducing reaction energy barriers of FA desorption. Simultaneously, finite element analysis reveals that the novelty hierarchical structure can increase the concentration of OH &#8722; and facilitate the mass transfer of OH &#8722; in the solution.</description>

                Developing earth-abundant electrocatalysts with optimized intrinsic active sites is crucial for enhancing bifunctional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance. In this study, we fabricated a hollow structured carbon framework utilizing NiFe Prussian Blue analogs (PBAs) as templates, while polypyrrole (PPy) and phosphotungstic acid (PW12). Pyrrole monomer underwent polymerization on the nanocubic PBA surface in the presence of PW12 (PBA@PPy-PW12). Subsequent carbothermal reduction created an N-doped carbon shell with embedded NiFe alloy and tungsten carbide (WC) nanoparticles. The polymeric PPy-PW12 nature can not only prevent the aggregation of PBA and WC structures but also enhance electrical conductivity by connecting neighboring nanospheres. Moreover, the introduction of WC can significantly enhance the bifunctional electrocatalytic activity of the carbon-based catalyst, which is attributed to synergism between the WC and NiFe materials within the NC layer. Consequently, NiFe/W0.3C@NC exhibited outstanding OER (overpotential = 290 mV for 10 mA/cm2; Tafel slope = 57 mV/dec) and ORR (half wave potential = 0.81 V; Tafel slope = 61 mV/dec) performances. This work presents a promising avenue for developing high-performance electrocatalysts for energy conversion systems that showcase remarkable efficiency, stability, and potential practicability.</description>

                Summary Woody plants display some photosynthetic activity in stems, but the biological role of stem photosynthesis and the specific contributions of bark and wood to carbon uptake and oxygen evolution remain poorly understood. We aimed to elucidate the functional characteristics of chloroplasts in stems of different ages in Fraxinus ornus . Our investigation employed diverse experimental approaches, including microsensor technology to assess oxygen production rates in whole stem, bark, and wood separately. Additionally, we utilized fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to characterize the relative abundance of photosystems I and II (PSI : PSII chlorophyll ratio) in bark and wood. Our findings revealed light&#8208;induced increases in O 2 production in whole stem, bark, and wood. We present the radial profile of O 2 production in F. ornus stems, demonstrating the capability of stem chloroplasts to perform light&#8208;dependent electron transport. Younger stems exhibited higher light&#8208;induced O 2 production and dark respiration rates than older ones. While bark emerged as the primary contributor to net O 2 production under light conditions, our data underscored that wood chloroplasts are also photosynthetically active. The FLIM analysis unveiled a lower PSI abundance in wood than in bark, suggesting stem chloroplasts are not only active but also acclimate to the spectral composition of light reaching inner compartments.</description>

                Zinc&#8211;air battery as one of the new generations of battery system, its theoretical specific energy is as high as 1086 Wh kg&#8722;1, specific capacity up to 820 mAh/g, and zinc has the advantages of environmental friendliness, resource abundance, low cost and good safety, so it has attracted much attention. However, due to its slow reaction kinetic process, zinc&#8211;air battery will produce a large charging overpotential usually up to 2 V, it is far beyond the theoretical voltage of 1.65 V, so reducing the overpotential of zinc&#8211;air batteries is extremely necessary, and the most common way to solve this problem is to use excellent catalyst cathode to improve the oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution kinetics of zinc&#8211;air batteries. So we developed a new photothermal assisted zinc&#8211;air battery system with Hollow carbon nanosphere@poly (vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene-chlorofluoroethylene)@CdS (HCN@PVTC@CdS) photocathode, the pyroelectric and photocatalysis effect can effectively promote the reaction kinetics and reduce the reaction overpotential. With the pyroelectric and photocatalysis synergistic effect, the zinc&#8211;air has displayed a high discharge potential of 1.33 V and a low charging potential of 1.5 V with good cycle stability. This multi-assist technology with built-in electric and light fields paves the way for the development of high-performance zinc&#8211;air batteries and other energy storage systems.</description>

                Hydrogen production by electrolysis of water is gradually becoming the main way to obtain green energy, but due to the scarcity of fresh water resources in the world, so the study of urea and seawater electrolysis has become an important work. In this experiment, different metal ions M (M=Co, Cr, Cu, Zn) doped Ni3S2/FeS were investigated as catalysts with good catalytic activity in hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) as well as in urea oxidation reaction (UOR) in urea electrolyte, and Co-Ni3S2/FeS and Cr-Ni3S2/FeS, which performed well in HER and UOR, were assembled into an electrolytic cell for the overall urea decomposition (1.50 V @ 10 mA cm&#8722;2). Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that Co-Ni3S2 possesses a lower free energy for H, while FeS possesses a higher density of states (DOS) near the Fermi energy level, and such a composite structure promotes significantly the catalytic activity of HER. The catalytic effect of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was further investigated in the seawater electrolyte, and the results showed that the performance of Co-Ni3S2/FeS catalyst was better, and certain ions in seawater affected durability of the catalyst. The electronic structure of the catalyst was investigated through the characterization of the catalyst and combined with the special morphology jointly promote the catalytic reaction in electrolysis experiments, which provides a candidate catalyst for electrolysis of urea and seawater oxidation reaction.</description>

                In situ growth of nanoarrays on conductive substrates is an efficient strategy for designing electrocatalysts. However, preparing array with excellent catalytic activities for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a challenge. Here, we construct a novel hollow sugar gourd-like Ni-Co-S@NiMoO4&#183;xH2O/NF nanocage array through MOF derivation strategy for stable solar-driven overall water splitting. Due to the hollow core&#8211;shell structure and multi-component advantages, the Ni-Co-S@NiMoO4&#183;xH2O/NF presents high density of active sites and fast charge transfer rate. Therefore, Ni-Co-S@NiMoO4&#183;xH2O/NF exhibits attractive electrocatalytic activity in alkaline electrolytes for HER (90 mV@10 mA cm&#8722;2) and OER (208 mV@10 mA cm&#8722;2, 245 mV@100 mA cm&#8722;2). The corresponding two-electrode electrolytic cell demonstrates small cell voltage (1.515 V @ 10 mA cm&#8722;2) and shows durability over 50 h at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, exhibiting excellent overall water splitting performance. It is worth noting that the solar-assisted electrolysis cell reaches a high solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion rate of 19.4 %. The construction of this unique hollow structure gives a fascinating method for improving the HER and OER performance of transition metal sulfide electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract Developing efficient, low-price non-noble metal-based electrocatalysts for overall water splitting in alkaline medium remains a formidable challenge. In our work, Cr-doped CoP/Fe2P (Cr-CoP/Fe2P) flower-like microsphere was synthesized through a simple hydrothermal and phosphating process. The resulting Cr-CoP/Fe2P electrocatalyst shows significantly enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance (262 mV @ 10 mA cm-2) and has a satisfactory hydrogen evolution reaction performance (114 mV @ 10 mA cm-2), coupled with favorable stability in an alkaline medium. Furthermore, when assembling Cr-CoP/Fe2P into an electrolytic cell, the two-electrode system can provide a current density of 10 mA cm-2 at a voltage of 1.61 V. At high current density, the performance of the electrolytic cell composed of Cr-CoP/Fe2P is superior to that of noble metal catalyst electrode pair. Electronic structure analysis and various characterizations confirm that Cr doping and the formation of CoP/Fe2P heterogeneous interfaces redistribute the electron densities of the active sites, enlarge the specific surface area, and enhance the aerophobicity of the catalysts, thereby improving the electrocatalytic property. This work provides a referable method for engineering highly efficient and stable non-noble polymetallic phosphides, which serve as bifunctional electrocatalyst for overall water splitting.</description>

                Designing hybrid photoelectrodes with graphene capable of efficient charge-carrier transfer and excellent chemical stability is an effective strategy for developing high-performance photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells. However, it remains unclear how the PEC properties are enhanced and how to control the junction properties in graphene/metal oxide heterojunction-based photoelectrodes. Here, we develop a deterministic junction to enhance PEC performance in graphene/tungsten trioxide (WO3)-based photoelectrodes by tuning the work function of graphene. It reveals that the band structure of graphene/WO3 heterojunctions can be modified by ultraviolet (UV) treatment on WO3 thin films. This modification is supported by the observation that a single-layer graphene/UV-treated WO3 photoelectrode exhibits significantly enhanced PEC activities toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (evidenced by features like a threefold increase in photocurrent, an onset potential shift, and improved stability), whereas the single-layer graphene/untreated WO3 electrode demonstrates improved properties for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Additionally, defects in the graphene layer formed during PEC water splitting contribute to high catalytic activities of the graphene/WO3 photoelectrode due to a decrease in the Gibbs free energy for OER and HER. These results emphasize that band structure engineering via work function tuning in graphene/WO3 heterostructures can provide multiple benefits for high PEC performance and long-term stability.</description>

                Despite the potential of heterostructure construction and surface reconstruction strategies to significantly enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance of transition metal compounds, integrating these approaches into a single material system remains a significant challenge. In this work, we report an efficient CoFe-LDH catalyst with multi-metal nitrides on the surface through simple and tunable N2-plasma treatment. Structural and chemical state characterization indicates a high concentration of defective sites in PL CoFe-LDH, which facilitates the exposure of a greater number of active N-Fe-O and N-Co-O centers. During the initial stage of the OER process, there is a rapid phase transition of Fe and Co, leading to the formation of metal (oxy)hydroxides. Meanwhile, Co3+ species gradually accumulate on the surfaces, which is responsible for the excellent OER catalytic activity. Then, the neighboring N atoms function as electron reservoirs, donating electrons to the Co sites to prevent overoxidation and dissolution of Co in the electrolyte, thus significantly enhancing the stability of the OER. The catalysts enable the achievement of ultralow OER overpotential, measuring 161.1 and 205.5 mV at current densities of 10 mA cm-2 and 200 mA cm-2, respectively, while exhibiting exceptional stability.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Anion-Hybrid in Atomic Ni Sites for High-Rate Water Electrolysis: Insights into the Charge Accumulation Mechanism</title>

                Single-atom catalysts, characterized by transition metal&#8211;(N/O)4 units on nanocarbon (M&#8211;(N/O)4&#8211;C), have emerged as efficient performers in water electrolysis. However, there are few guiding principles for accurately controlling the ligand fields of single atoms to further stimulate the catalyst activities. Herein, using the Ni&#8211;(N/O)4&#8211;C unit as a model, we develop a further modification of the P anion on the outer shells to modulate the morphology of the ligand. The catalyst thus prepared possesses high activity and excellent long-term durability, surpassing commercial Pt/C, RuO2, and currently reported single-atom catalysts. Notably, mechanistic studies demonstrated that the pseudocapacitive feature of multiscale anion-hybrid nanocarbon is considerable at accumulating enough positive charge [Q], contributing to the high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) order (&#946;) through the rate formula. DFT calculations also indicate that the catalytic activity is decided by the suitable barrier energy of the intermediates due to charge accumulation. This work reveals the activity origin of single atoms on multihybrid nanocarbon, providing a clear experiential formula for designing the electronic configuration of single-atom catalysts to boost electrocatalytic performance.</description>

      <title>A highly-stable and low-energy-barrier photoelectrocatalyst (NiFe-LDH@Ti-MOF) for water splitting at high current densities via breaking the atomic structure symmetry</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiec.2024.05.005</link>

                There is a flurry of interest in enhancing the stability and efficiency of photoelectrocatalysts in water splitting at high current densities. In the present study, nickel&#8211;iron layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) was decorated with MIP-177-LT (Ti-metal organic framework (MOF)) to fabricate a heteroatom electrocatalyst (NiFe-LDH@Ti-MOF). The overpotentials of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) turned out to be very low: 199 and 232 mV at current densities of 200 and 600 mA cm&#8722;2, in that order. Then, current densities of 1,000 mA cm&#8722;2 were applied to the modified electrode over a long period of 800 h, and this generated a higher stability than that of the commercial IrO2. Further, its mass activity proved &#8764;2 and 7 times as high as those of IrO2 and NiFe-LDH, in that order. Furthermore, for water splitting, the produced photoelectrocatalyst obtained a current density of 1,000 mA cm&#8722;2 using only 1.6 V, and this performance remained changeless for 800 h, which can be considered the most superb performance ever reported. The experimental characterization revealed that during the process of doping Ti-MOF on NiFe-LDH, symmetry breaking takes place in the atomic structure of the LDH surface, which increases the active sites in the photoelectrocatalyst. The presence of oxygen in the Ti-MOF active sites improves the efficiency of OER at high current densities and also contributes to the higher stability of multiple heteroatomic interfaces for water splitting. The propounded strategy enables the generation of oxygen and hydrogen from water splitting at high current densities on an industrial scale by changing the symmetry of the atomic structure of heteroatomic photocatalysts.</description>

                The exploration of multifunctional electrocatalysts with cost-effective and high kinetic activity for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for the development of advanced energy conversion and storage equipment. Herein, a novel hierarchical mesoporous/macropores MIL-101(Fe) derivative carbon catalyst material was prepared by a simple molten ZnCl2-assisted synthesis route. Specifically, 1H-benzotriazole (BTA) organic ligands were intentionally introduced as nitrogen sources in order to induce the formation of charge-rich regions through an electronegative nitrogen doping control strategy, and most importantly, the lone pair electron-rich nature of element N could facilitate the separation and anchoring of iron species enchanted the utilization rate of active sites. Because of these properties, the as-prepared catalyst (denoted as FeSACs/NxC) possesses unrivalled bifunction electrocatalytic activity and durability for the ORR and OER. The FeSACs/N1.25C as working electrode exhibits a quite satisfactory electrochemical performance for the ORR (half-wave potential of 0.82 V) and OER (a small overpotential of 302 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2) in the classic three-electrode configuration. Moreover, the FeSACs/N1.25C-based air cathode imparts encouraging performance in a rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery prototype with an open-circuit voltage of 1.45 V, a specific capacity of 792.16 mAh g&#8722;1, an energy density of 871.38 Wh kg&#8722;1, and excellent stability for 120 h. This work has opened the way for the development of low-cost, fast kinetic and stable non-noble metal multifunctional catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Urea oxidation reaction (UOR) features a lower overpotential compared to the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during electrolysis, facilitating the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. The distribution of charge plays a pivotal role in promoting the adsorption and cleavage of chemical groups in urea molecules, which can be modulated by introducing a heterostructure. Herein, a CoS 1.097 /Ni 3 S 2 heterojunction grown on nickel foam is designed, serving simultaneously for UOR and HER. Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the spontaneous charge transfer at the CoS 1.097 /Ni 3 S 2 heterointerface induces the formation of localized electrophilic/nucleophilic regions, intelligently adsorbing electron&#8208;donating/electron&#8208;withdrawing groups in urea molecules, activating chemical bonds, thereby triggering urea decomposition. CoS 1.097 /Ni 3 S 2 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for urea, requiring only a potential of 1.22 V (with an overpotential of 0.85 V) to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 in UOR, and potentials of 1.27 and 1.57 V to reach current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm &#8722;2 , respectively, in a UOR//HER electrolysis cell, maintaining good stability at high current density for 60 h. Tests in real urine have demonstrated performance similar to that in urea electrolyte. This work represents nearly the best catalytic performance of transition metal&#8208;based materials in UOR applications, promising for both efficient hydrogen production and urea decomposition.</description>

      <title>Induced Diffusion Effect Realizes Heterogeneous Separation/Aggregation for In Situ Fabrication of Heterostructure with Enhanced Catalytic Activity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202405339</link>

                Abstract Space charge transfer, which can be provided by heterogeneous structure, is the key to efficient electrocatalytic processes. However, difficulty in controlling the relative atomic diffusion rates due to different atomic radii and affinity makes heterogeneous nanostructures difficult to be accurately designed. Herein, an induced diffusion strategy based on affinity differences between elements is proposed to direct the separation/aggregation of different components in the precursor. The key to strategy in this study is the different affinity of Cu and Co to S/P in the precursor of CuCo Prussian blue analogue (PBA). By controlling the molar ratio of S and P during the phosphorization/vulcanization process, induced diffusion can be achieved and leads to directional separation/aggregation of Cu and Co species. As a result, a heterogeneous yolk&#8208;shell Cu 2 S@CoP 2 &#8208;C&#8208;N&#8208;S structure is successfully synthesized with a reticular CoP2&#8208;C&#8208;N&#8208;Cu&#8208;S as the shell and a Cu 2 S nanocrystal as the core. The space charge effect of the semiconductor heterojunction resulting from component separation/aggregation significantly promotes oxygen evolution reaction, resulting in an ultralow overpotential of 180 mV at 10 mA&#183;cm &#8722;2 . This work not only provides a simple method for efficient separation of key components in gas&#8208;solid systems but also provides a method for fine&#8208;tuning the active site in an active&#8208;site&#8208;engineering approach.</description>

                In the application of renewable energy, the oxidation&#8211;reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are two crucial reactions. Single-atom catalysts (SACs) based on metal-doped graphene have been widely employed due to their high activity and high atom utilization efficiency. However, the catalytic activity is significantly influenced by different metals and local coordination, making it challenging to efficiently screen through either experimental or density functional theory (DFT) calculations. To address this issue, this study employed a combination of DFT calculations and machine learning (DFT-ML) to investigate rare earth-modified carbon-based (RENxC6&#8211;x) electrocatalysts. Based on computational data from 75 catalysts, we trained two ML models to capture the underlying patterns of physical properties and overpotential. Subsequently, the candidate catalysts were screened, leading to the discovery of four ORR catalysts, nine OER catalysts, and five bifunctional electrocatalysts, all of which were thoroughly validated for their stability. Lastly, by integrating the ML models with the SHAP analysis framework, we revealed the influence of atomic radius, Pauling electronegativity, and other features on the catalytic activity. Additionally, we analyzed the physicochemical properties of potential catalysts through DFT calculations. The revolutionary DFT-ML approach provides a crucial driving force for the design and synthesis of potential catalysts in subsequent studies.</description>

      <title>Constructing Nano&#8208;Interlayer Inhibiting Interfacial Degradation toward High&#8208;Voltage PEO&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>

                Abstract The interfacial instability between PEO&#8208;based solid electrolyte (SPE) and high&#8208;voltage cathode materials inhibits the longevity of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer lithium metal batteries (ASSPLBs). Herein, for the first time it is demonstrated, that contact loss caused by gas generation from interfacial side reactions between the high&#8208;voltage cathode and solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) can also arise in ASSPLBs. To alleviate the interfacial side reactions, a LiNb 0.6 Ti 0.5 O 3 (LNTO) layer is well coated on LiNi 0.83 Co 0.07 Mn 0.1 O 2 (NCM83), denoted as (CNCM83). The LNTO layer with low electronic conductivity reduces the decomposition drive force of SPE. Furthermore, Ti and Nb in the LNTO layer spontaneously migrate inside the NCM83 surface to form a strong Ti/Nb&#9472;O bond, stalling oxygen evolution in high&#8208;voltage cathodes. The interfacial degradation phenomena, including SPE decomposition, detrimental phase transition and intragranular cracks of NCM83, and void formation between cathode and SPE, are effectively mitigated by the LNTO layer. Therefore, the growth rate of interfacial resistance (R CEI ) decreases from 37.6 &#937; h &#8722;0.5 for bare NCM83 to 2.4 &#937; h &#8722;0.5 for CNCM83 at 4.2 V. Moreover, 4.2 V PEO&#8208;based ASSPLBs achieve impressive cyclability with high capacity retention of 135 mAh g &#8722;1 (75%) even after 300 cycles at 0.5 C.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the electric, dielectric and optical properties of template-free hydrothermally synthesized CuO nanostructures via Co doping</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.05.051</link>
      <description>M.P. Monis, H. A. A. Saadallah, Yuda Prima Hardianto, Mohamed Khairy, N. M. A. Hadia, A.M. Abdel Hakeem, E.M.M. Ibrahim, Ceramics international. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396694255

                Facile template-free hydrothermal method was utilized for preparing CuO nanostructures (NSs) doped with Co element (Cu1-xCoxO (x=0.0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08)). A single-phase monoclinic crystal with changing in morphology from rod- to sphere-like nanoparticles was observed. . The temperature dependency of DC electrical conductivity revealed that the shallow and deep donor levels are responsible for the DC conduction in low and high temperature ranges, respectively. The Ac electrical conductivity, dielectric constant and dielectric loss were also measured as functions in frequency and temperature. The frequency dependence of the AC conductivity was well represented by the Jonscher's universal power law. The AC conduction was governed by the Correlated Barrier Hopping model where the inter-well and intra-well hopping mechanisms contribute to the electrical conduction in the low and high frequency ranges, respectively. The activation energies and the barrier height decreased while the dielectric constant and dielectric loss increased with increasing the Co content. The relaxation and deformational polarizations predominate and the overall behavior of dielectric constant fits well with the Koops' model. The Cole-Cole plots indicated a decrease in the sample resistance with increasing temperatures and Co concentrations. UV-vis absorption spectra exhibited two peaks at wavelengths 252 and 323 nm. The optical energy gap was calculated using Tauc's equation and decrease from 2.24 to 2.1 eV with increasing the Co concentrations. The effect of Co-doping on CuO was explored for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and found a decrease in the overvoltage (&#956;) about 50 mV at 0.08 ratios, which declares that the doping of Co element enhances the electrical conductivity and feasibility for further electrocatalytic improvement.</description>

      <title>Dealloying of Mg-based alloys for production of self-supporting metallic nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intermet.2024.108308</link>
      <description>Jian&#8208;Bin Lin, Weitao Zheng, Wenxue Ke, Xin He, Pei Liang, Chengkai Zhang, Intermetallics. 170(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396650185

                Dealloying is a proficient technique in the fabrication of nanostructured metals, particularly nanoporous materials, with promising potential for diverse applications. However, the development of robust and self-standing nanostructured metal foils through dealloying presents significant challenges. By generating an alloy layer on the surface of the metal foil, nanostructures can be generated on the metal foil surface through subsequent dealloying. This approach utilizes the inherent flexibility and ductility of the metal foil to ensure self-support. It also allows for the tailoring of the structure and composition of the dealloyed nanostructured metal by manipulation of the phase constitution in the surface alloy layer. In this study, we report a strategy for generating alloy layers on metal foil surfaces through the thermal evaporation of magnesium (Mg) followed by annealing. Upon dealloying the surface alloy layer, we successfully obtain self-supported nanostructured metal foils. Employing copper (Cu) as an example, we demonstrate that Mg can form a Mg&#8211;Cu alloy layer on the surface of a Cu foil, where the control over the alloy layer's phase composition and thickness is achieved by adjusting the annealing duration. Furthermore, we investigated the feasibility of this method on nickel (Ni) substrates, including Ni foils and Ni foams. Moreover, by further functionalizing the resulting nanostructured Ni foil, we transformed it into Ni(OH)2/Ni foil and explored its performance in the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The resulting catalyst achieved a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at a potential of only 349 mV in a 1 M KOH solution, exhibiting a Tafel slope of 84.52 mV dec&#8722;1. Following 10 h of stability testing, the catalyst exhibited negligible degradation in performance. This study provides a convenient and versatile pathway for preparing self-supported nanostructured metals.</description>

      <title>Influence of solution pH on the dynamics of oxygen bubbles on the surface of TiO2-NTAs electrodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2024.04.293</link>

                The rise of concentration resistance caused by bubble growth is a key factor affecting the photoelectrochemical water splitting efficiency. In this research, we employed an electrochemical workstation, a synchronized measuring system, and a CCD camera to investigate the in-situ evolution of oxygen bubbles on the surfaces of TiO2-NTAs and C/TiO2-NTAs electrodes. The connection among the critical nucleation, growth and departure behavior of a single bubble on the photoanode surface and photocurrent curves at different solution pH (1&#8211;13) has been investigated. For TiO2-NTAs, it was found that strong alkalinity significantly reduces the voltage required for critical bubble nucleation. The photocurrent rises approximately 1.5 times when the control voltage is 0.10 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) by pH increasing from 1 to 13 and while the bubble evolution cycles decline by approximately 3.2 times. The photocurrent rises by 10.4 times compared with pH = 9 and by 7.3 times compared with pH = 13 when the control voltage is 0.71 V (vs. RHE), respectively. We also found that the oxygen bubble evolution of C/TiO2-NTAs is similar to TiO2-NTAs. When pH = 3&#8211;13, the average photocurrent of C/TiO2-NTAs electrode is higher than that of TiO2-NTAs, and the average bubble evolution cycles are lower than those of TiO2-NTAs at the same pH. According to the results, carbon films can rise the absorption capacity of TiO2-NTAs and significantly improve the effectiveness of photogenerated holes and electrons departure. Meanwhile, based on the oxygen bubble force balance model on the photoanode surface, the concentration Marangoni force rises with the increase of pH, which leads to the growth of bubble departure diameter. The outcomes demonstrate that oxygen bubbles on the photoanode surface can be successfully eliminated in strongly alkaline settings.</description>

      <title>The Implications of Thermal Hydrodynamic Atmospheric Escape on the
  TRAPPIST-1 Planets</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2405.02401</link>
      <description>Megan T. Gialluca, R. Barnes, Victoria Meadows, Rodolfo Garc&#237;a, Jessica Birky, Eric Agol, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396715330

                JWST observations of the 7-planet TRAPPIST-1 system will provide an excellent opportunity to test outcomes of stellar-driven evolution of terrestrial planetary atmospheres, including atmospheric escape, ocean loss and abiotic oxygen production. While most previous studies use a single luminosity evolution for the host star, we incorporate observational uncertainties in stellar mass, luminosity evolution, system age, and planetary parameters to statistically explore the plausible range of planetary atmospheric escape outcomes. We present probabilistic distributions of total water loss and oxygen production as a function of initial water content, for planets with initially pure water atmospheres and no interior-atmosphere exchange. We find that the interior planets are desiccated for initial water contents below 50 Earth oceans. For TRAPPIST-1e, f, g, and h, we report maximum water loss ranges of 8.0$^{+1.3}_{-0.9}$, 4.8$^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$, 3.4$^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$, and 0.8$^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ Earth oceans, respectively, with corresponding maximum oxygen retention of 1290$^{+75}_{-75}$, 800$^{+40}_{-40}$, 560$^{+30}_{-25}$, and 90$^{+10}_{-10}$ bars. We explore statistical constraints on initial water content imposed by current water content, which could inform evolutionary history and planet formation. If TRAPPIST-1b is airless while TRAPPIST-1c possesses a tenuous oxygen atmosphere, as initial JWST observations suggest, then our models predict an initial surface water content of 8.2$^{+1.5}_{-1.0}$ Earth oceans for these worlds, leading to the outer planets retaining $&gt;$1.5 Earth oceans after entering the habitable zone. Even if TRAPPIST-1c is airless, surface water on the outer planets would not be precluded.</description>

                Perovskite oxygen carriers in a methane chemical looping partial oxidation process enable high reactivity over 850 &#176;C. Lowering the reaction temperature helps to circumvent energy dissipation and couple the above-mentioned process with energy-efficient systems. This paper demonstrates the attractive oxygen-donating capacity of Fe&#8211;Ni-based perovskite oxygen carriers for methane partial oxidation. The aforesaid process exhibits more than 70% methane conversion and 6.71 mmol&#183;g&#8211;1 unit syngas yield at 700 &#176;C, using LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3. This impressive high reactivity mainly originates from the lowered lattice oxygen bonding strength and the spontaneously constructed active Ni-rich surface of perovskite oxides by Ni doping. In addition to the outward migration of lattice oxygen, active metal elements, such as Ni, continuously segregate to the surface with the reduction of perovskite oxides, promoting methane partial oxidation. We speculate that the chemical looping reaction pathway consists of consecutive competitive reactions based on analysis of the real-time product distribution and the dynamic evolution of oxygen carriers. Highly selective syngas production can be achieved on LaFe0.5Ni0.5O3 by reducing reaction temperatures or increasing space velocity to balance methane dissociation and lattice oxygen release kinetics. Irreversible Ni segregation and phase-separation-induced inert La2O3 on the surface of perovskite oxides during redox cycles are responsible for the cyclic performance degradation of oxygen carriers. This work offers intriguing references to design perovskite oxygen carriers for intensifying the medium-temperature chemical looping partial oxidation process.</description>

                The chemical reactions and phase transitions at high voltages determine the electrochemical properties of high voltage layered cathodes such as Ni-rich rhombohedral materials. Here, we performed a comprehensive and comparative study of the cationic and anionic redox reactions, as well as the structural evolution of a series of industrial Ni-rich layered cathode materials with and without Al doping, which are being utilized in the cells made by LG Energy Solutions Co.. We combined the results from X-ray spectroscopy, operando electrochemical mass spectrometry, and neutron diffraction with electrochemical properties, and revealed the different oxygen activities associated with structural and electrochemical degradations. We show that Al doping suppresses the irreversible oxygen release thereby enhancing the reversible lattice oxygen redox resulting from the interplay between static (doped Al) and dynamic disorders (reversible oxygen redox). With this modulated oxygen activity, the Ni-rich cathode's notorious H2-H3 structural phase transition becomes highly reversible. Our findings disentangle the different oxygen activities during high-voltage cycling and clarify the role of dopants in the Ni-rich layered cathodes in terms of structural and electrochemical stability finally making all the cell makers get back to the fundamental investigation regarding whether high-Ni NCM chemistry (NCM811 or NCM 91/2 1/2) is substantially beneficial compared to its mid-Ni homologues (NCM622).</description>

                The article presents an overview of the research contributions in the field of Marine Micropaleontology and Paleoceanography, made by the Indian scientists during the last five years. Keeping pace with recent development in analytical techniques, significant contributions have been made in diversified research aspects: paleoceanographic proxy development, Asian monsoon variability and dynamics, Neogene-Quaternary evolution of the Indian Ocean in relation to the global climate change, carbonate cycle and ocean acidification, development of oxygen minimum zone and its variability through time. Although, the major emphasis is given to the Indian Ocean paleoceanographic studies, a few Indian research groups are also actively engaged in understanding ocean-climate evolution of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, inter-basinal connections and their implications on global ocean deep circulation and climate on tectonic to millennial time scales.</description>

                Abstract Defects can introduce atomic structural modulation and tailor performance of materials. Herein, it demonstrates that semiconductor WO 3 with inert electrocatalytic behavior can be activated through defect&#8208;induced tensile strains. Structural characterizations reveal that when simply treated in Ar/H 2 atmosphere, oxygen vacancies will generate in WO 3 and cause defective structures. Stacking faults are found in defects, thus modulating electronic structure and transforming electrocatalytic&#8208;inert WO 3 into highly active electrocatalysts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed to calculate * H adsorption energies on various WO x surfaces, revealing the oxygen vacancy composition and strain predicted to optimize the catalytic activity of hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Such defective tungsten oxides can be integrated into commercial proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser with comparable performance toward Pt&#8208;based PEM. This work demonstrates defective metal oxides as promising non&#8208;noble metal catalysts for commercial PEM green&#8208;hydrogen generation.</description>

      <title>Black TiO2 and Oxygen Vacancies: Unraveling the Role in the Thermal Anatase-to-Rutile Transformation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/applnano5020007</link>
      <description>Mattia Allieta, Mauro Coduri, Alberto Naldoni, Applied nano. 5(2)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396613998

                Understanding the role of oxygen vacancies in the phase transformation of metal oxide nanomaterials is fundamental to design more efficient opto-electronic devices for a variety of applications, including sensing, spintronics, photocatalysis, and photo-electrochemistry. However, the structural mechanisms behind the phase transformation in reducible oxides remain poorly described. Here, we compare P25 and black TiO2 during the thermal anatase-to-rutile transformation using in situ synchrotron powder diffraction. The precise measurement of the phase fractions, unit cell parameters, and Ti-O bond sheds light on the phase transformation dynamics. Notably, we observe distinct temperature-dependent shifts in the relative phase fractions of anatase and rutile in both materials highlighting the role of the oxygen vacancy in promoting the phase transformation. We employ bond valence concepts for structural modeling, revealing unique trends in temperature evolution of Ti-O distances of black rutile, confirming that this TiO2 phase is preferentially reduced over anatase. These findings not only enhance our understanding of phase transitions in TiO2 but also open new ways for the design of advanced photocatalytic materials through targeted phase control.</description>

      <title>Buoyancy control and air breathing in royal knifefish (&lt;i&gt;Chitala blanci&lt;/i&gt;) and a new hypothesis for the early evolution of vertebrate air&#8208;breathing behaviors</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ar.25460</link>
      <description>Elska B Kaczmarek, Elizabeth L. Brainerd, &#152;The &#156;anatomical record. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396704495

                Abstract We present the first description of inspiration&#8208;first air breaths in royal knifefish, Chitala blanci , a ray&#8208;finned fish known to use four&#8208;stroke air breaths. Four&#8208;stroke breaths are used by nearly all ray&#8208;finned fish species that use their gas bladder to breathe air and are the ancestral breath type of ray&#8208;finned fishes. Interestingly, one such species, Amia calva , is known to perform two distinct breath types. Amia use four&#8208;stroke breaths when they need more oxygen and performs inspiration&#8208;first breaths to restore buoyancy. We observed that C. blanci also performs inspiration&#8208;first breaths and tested whether the two breath types are performed for the same functions in C. blanci as they are in Amia . We recorded the frequency of each breath type when exposed to aquatic hypoxia and two conditions of oxygen availability. We found that C. blanci performed more four&#8208;stroke breaths (81% &#177; 15% of total breaths) than inspiration&#8208;first breaths when exposed to aerial normoxia but performed more inspiration&#8208;first breaths (72% &#177; 40%) than four&#8208;stroke breaths when exposed to aerial hyperoxia. These patterns match those described for Amia and indicate that C. blanci performs four&#8208;stroke breaths in response to oxygen depletion and performs inspiration&#8208;first breaths to maintain buoyancy. Few studies have examined the role of air&#8208;breathing in buoyancy regulation. Decreasing buoyancy, rather than oxygen availability, to stimulate air breaths may reveal that inspiration&#8208;first breaths are more common among fishes than we are aware. We consider this possibility and present a new hypothesis for the origin and early evolution of air breathing in vertebrates.</description>

                The Zhang-Rice (ZR) state is a strongly hybridized bound state formed by transition-metal and oxygen atoms. The spin fluctuations within the ZR state are known to play an important role in high-${T}_{\mathrm{c}}$ superconductivity in cuprates. Here, we employ a combination of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), and ab initio embedded dynamical mean-field theory (eDMFT) to investigate the influence of magnetic ordering on the spectral characteristics of the valence band and Mn $2p$ core-level in MnO (001) ultrathin films. Our results demonstrate that a complex spin-selective evolution of Mn $3d\ensuremath{-}\mathrm{O}\phantom{\rule{4pt}{0ex}}2p$ hybridization develops due to the long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering. This hybridization significantly alters the spectral shape and weight of the ZR state. Specifically, in the AFM phase, we observed the sharpening of the ZR state and band folding with the periodicity of the AFM unit cell of MnO(001). We also demonstrated a strong connection between the spectral evolution of the ZR state and the non-local screening channels of the photoexcited core holes. Further, our detailed temperature-dependent study reveals the presence of short-range antiferromagnetic correlations that exist at much higher temperatures than Neel temperature $({T}_{\mathrm{N}})$ and shows the evolution of the ZR state across the magnetic transitions and its implication to the core-hole screening in $3d$ binary transition metal oxides.</description>

                The pursuit of precise and detailed kinetic characteristics continues to drive advancements in both modeling and measurement methodologies. A multiscale kinetic model was developed to analyze the redox behaviors of the hematite oxygen carrier (OC), characterized by a fluidized bed thermogravimetric analyzer (FB-TGA). This multiscale model integrates bulk diffusion of lattice oxygen, discrete growth of product islands, particle-scale gas diffusion, and interphase gas exchange, offering a comprehensive insight into the evolution of reaction rate and mass transfer. The investigation revealed that the surface diffusion rates of gas molecules are the crucial determinant in the Fe2O3 reactivity, with rapid surface diffusion delaying the formation of an enclosed product layer. The exceptional diffusion conditions and precise weight measurement capability of FB-TGA yielded faster reaction rate constants than conventional methods, facilitating transformative insights into rate-limiting factors. External diffusion and bulk lattice oxygen diffusion were identified as rapid and insufficient in imposing limitations on the overall reaction. Conversely, intraparticle diffusion emerged as the primary rate-limiting step in kinetic experiments even involving 0.1&#8211;0.15 mm hematite OC particles, especially during the initial oxidation of Fe3O4, where the mass transfer efficiency dropped below 85%. In actual chemical looping combustion environments utilizing 0.3&#8211;0.45 mm hematite OC particles, the resistance of intraparticle diffusion significantly intensified, inhibiting gas&#8211;solid reaction rates to an extent comparable to interphase mass transfer. Based on the insights derived from the multiscale model analysis, strategies for optimizing OC particle structure and reactor design have been proposed to enhance gas&#8211;solid reactions.</description>

                Although the Rare Earth (RE)2Fe14B type magnets were invented in the 1980s and are widely used worldwide. Yet, the phase formation and dissolution mechanisms are still not crystal clear. The reaction dynamics between rare earth elements (REE) and Iron enriched matrix is essential to understand the formation of hard magnetic REE-Fe-B phase or, conversely, phase dissociation and performance degeneration. The development of reaction mechanism is fundamentally important for process engineering and performance manipulation. This work investigates the interface reaction dynamics between REE and Iron enriched matrix via in-situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The Focused ion beam (FIB) procedure and in-situ STEM experiments are specifically designed to achieve both oxygen-involved and oxygen-free reaction mechanisms within one specimen. The reaction dynamics at high temperatures are frozen to room temperature (RT) by rapid quenching, preserving the solid-liquid interface dynamics between Fe23B6 and liquid phases. Serial atomic resolution STEM images depict lattice evolution while REE atoms embed into the Fe23B6 lattice. The presented work also demonstrates that combining advanced FIB procedure with in-situ annealing &amp; quenching STEM is a powerful tool for investigating high-temperature reaction mechanisms and interface phenomena of the complex system.</description>

                Exploring efficient and robust electrocatalysts with low cost for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical for practical application of electrochemical water splitting. Ru-based platinum group electrocatalysts shows great potential in HER, however, Ru suffer from sluggish kinetics of water dissociation for electrochemical reduction of water to hydrogen in alkaline environments. Here, oxygen atoms are introduced into Ru by simple secondary heat treatment to form Ru-O-C bonds to weak the strength of Ru-H bond. The overpotential of the catalyst is only 19 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and the stability is greatly improved. Theoretical calculations reveal that the Ru-O-C structure formed in RuO2 facilitates the dissociation of H-OH, which is the rate-determining step in alkaline electrolytes, leading to significant improvement in HER activity.</description>

                Rational reuse of municipal sludge to produce electro-Fenton electrode can not only save resources, but also produce superior peroxide and degradation pollutants simultaneously. Herein, a novel electro-Fenton electrode derived from sludge biochar loaded on Ni foam (SBC@Ni) was constructed via high temperature pyrolysis and chemical coating for efficient H2O2 evolution and pollutant degradation. Systematic experiments and density functional theory calculations (DFT calculation) explained that the production of graphite C and graphite N during high-temperature pyrolysis of municipal sludge can greatly enhance the oxygen reduction reaction of SBC@Ni electrode and promote the evolution of H2O2. And the hybrid heterojunctions, such as FeP, also played a key role in electrocatalytic processes. Notably, the electrode still exhibited excellent performance after 1000 linear scans and 12 hours of continuous current stimulation, which demonstrated the excellent stability of the electrode. Moreover, SBC@Ni electrode can not only effectively oxidize 4-chlorophenol through the electro-Fenton effect, but also fully mineralize organic matter, indicating promising environmental application. The free radical quenching experiment also revealed that the &#183;OH is the main active species for 4-CP degradation in SBC@Ni electro-Fenton system.</description>

      <title>Cross-scale deciphering thermal failure process of Ni-rich layered cathode</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nanoen.2024.109685</link>

                Ni-rich LiNixCoyMn1-x-yO2 (NCM) layered oxides are low-cost high-energy density cathode materials, but plagued by its poor thermal stability incurred safety concerns. The thermal failure process of the layered cathode is accompanied by heat generation and oxygen release, which drives the battery into thermal runaway (TR). Aiming to fully understand the TR process and the structure evolution, this work applies diverse characterization techniques onto a polycrystalline Ni-rich layered cathode (LiNi0.83Mn0.05Co0.12O2 (PCN83)) to comprehensively investigate its thermal failure process at multiple scales. From macro level, we validate that it is the cathode thermal failure that drives the battery from the heat accumulation stage into TR in adiabatic conditions. From micro level, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) verifies that the thermal failure of PCN83 starts from 150 &#176;C, which is much lower than the TR temperature measured from macro level tests. We reveal that the PCN83 cathode experiences sequential phase transitions before the TR, where the phase transition mechanism is illustrated from the atomic scale and the pore evolution process is unraveled. In situ heating TEM further reveals that thermal failure is preferentially initiated from grain boundaries and defect regions. These findings provide an in-depth understanding of the whole thermal failure process of NMC-based layered cathode materials and sheds new lights on the rational design of Ni-rich cathode materials with improved thermal safety.</description>

      <title>Corrosion Kinetics of T91 Steel under Low Oxygen Conditions (10-7wt% O) in Lead-Bismuth Eutectic at 500 &#186;C</title>

                Among the advanced reactor designs of the fourth generation, the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) stands out as one of six distinct types. The corrosion caused by the liquid Lead-Bismuth Eutectic (LBE) on structural materials is recognized as a significant obstacle hindering the development of LFR. The corrosion kinetics of T91 steel in static LBE with 10-7 wt% oxygen at 500 &#186;C is analyzed in this study. The formed oxide scale consists of an outer (Fe, Cr)3O4 layer with a Fe-Cr spinel structure and an inner internal oxidation zone (IOZ). The thickness evolution of the oxide layers follows a parabolic rule, with rate constants determined for different layers. The dissolution rate of metals into the LBE decreases over time, indicating diminishing the concentration gradient of Fe across the oxide layer-LBE interface. The observed deviations from expected norms may be attributed to dynamic flow conditions and non-isothermal loop experiments, which accelerate Fe diffusion into LBE.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of stress evolution in environmental barrier coatings considering the presence of crack channels</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2024.05.072</link>

                The roles of crack channel transitions and thermally grown oxides (TGO) in the failure of environmental barrier coatings (EBCs) should be clarified. Hence, in this study, the laws of penetration and delamination crack evolution were investigated using a virtual crack extension method for multilayer materials to gain insights into the transformation conditions with a framework for a coupled thermal/mechanical/chemical numerical model of TGO containing channel cracks developed based on this law. The framework integrates diffusion, TGO growth, and phase transformation of the oxides. A theoretical model for high-temperature gas corrosion of EBCs coupled with deformation, mass diffusion, and chemical reactions was proposed, with the results indicating that the cracks transitioned from vertical to exfoliation cracks in the ytterbium dibasic silicate (YbDS) layer. The coupling effect of cracks and stresses led to non-uniform growth of the TGO by affecting the oxygen diffusion and inflow rates. The y-direction stresses at the YbDS/TGO interface near the crack channel changed from compressive to tensile stresses after cooling, making the first location to undergo delamination failure. The proposed model can provide better guidance for designing EBCs systems and supporting the life prediction of EBCs in service environments.</description>

                Abstract:: In recent years, research and development efforts have been heavily focused on conductive diamond electrodes for electrochemical applications. Such initiatives may have been spurred by their broad potential window, low background current, chemical inertness, and mechanical robustness. Compared to other carbon-based materials, conducting diamond can oxidize several analytes before the breakdown of water in aqueous electrolytes. Since the evolution of oxygen and hydrogen does not obstruct the analysis, this is significant for the detection and/or identification of species in solution. As a result, conductive diamond electrodes expand the application of electrochemical detection and make it possible to use them for analytes that are incompatible with traditional electrode materials. Fabricating boron-doped diamond films via chemical vapor deposition on different substrates is of special interest. This article highlights the therapeutic and electroanalytical applications of boron-doped diamond electrodes in various aspects in addition to the synthetic strategies to obtain Boron Doped Diamond Electrodes (BDDE), the cost-effectiveness of BDD and its in-vivo compatibility that will help the analytical researchers to learn almost everything about the previous studies done on BDDE and encourage them to work more efficiently in this research field.</description>

                Aluminium is one of the most abundant metals in the universe and impacts the evolution of various astrophysical environments. Currently detected Al&#8208;bearing molecules represent only a small fraction of the aluminium budget, suggesting that aluminium may reside in other species. AlO and AlOH molecules are abundant in the oxygen&#8208;rich supergiant stars such as VY Canis Majoris, a stellar molecular factory with 60+ molecules including the prebiotic NC&#8208;bearing species. Additional Al&#8208;bearing molecules with N, C, O, and H may form in O&#8208;rich environments with radiation&#8208;accelerated chemistry. Here, we present spectroscopic identification of novel aluminium&#8208;bearing molecules composed of [Al, N, C, O, H] and [Al, N, C, O] from the reactions of Al atoms and HNCO in solid argon matrix, which are potential Al&#8208;bearing molecules in space. Photoinduced transformations among six [Al, N, C, O, H] isomers and three [Al, N, C, O] isomers, along with their dissociation reactions forming the known interstellar species, have been disclosed. These results provide new insight into the chemical network of astronomically detected Al&#8208;bearing species in space.</description>

      <title>Novel ultra-low NOx coal combustion technologies based on local microenvironment targeted regulation. Part 1. Selective oxygenation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.combustflame.2024.113486</link>
      <description>Xiuchao Yang, Jiaxun Liu, Guoqing Chen, Zining Zhou, Xinyu Zhong, Jianguo Liu, Xiumin Jiang, Combustion and flame. 265(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396650281

                Developing a novel high-efficiency coal combustion technology with ultra-low NOx emission is urgently needed to sustain the good ecological environment. Here, the targeted regulation of local microenvironment around fuel-N, such as functional groups, radicals, molecular configurations, and reaction atmosphere, is realized by the selective oxidation. The molecular configurations, including pore networks and microcrystalline structure in coal, are well characterized through synchrotron radiation-induced SAXS (small angle X-ray scattering) and WAXS (wide angle X-ray scattering) simultaneously. Furthermore, by combining density functional theory (DFT) and experiments, the effects of the local microenvironment on the nitrogen transformation and NO evolution during the thermal conversion are focused on. The results indicate that for the PPA oxidation, the H radicals attack the adjacent carbon to pyrrole/pyridine nitrogen, promoting the conversion of fuel-N to HCN. On the other hand, for the H2O2 oxidation, disrupting the &#960; bond electron cloud by the CO and C = O on the ortho carbon of pyrrole/pyridine dominates the NH3 generation. Additionally, the increased La (average graphene layer extent), a3 (average interlayer spacing), &#963;3 (standard deviation of interlayer spacing) and &#963;1 (standard deviation of the first-neighbor distribution) induce massive smaller pores, promoting the generation of abundant reaction defects inside the particles. Importantly, the intensified adsorption on abundant active sites lead to the decreased HCN and increased NH3 evolution, which is adverse for the interaction between homogeneous and heterogeneous NO reduction. Interestingly, the PAA selective oxidation can reduce NO emission by 31.72 % - 34.30 % during the air combustion, which is far better than the H2O2 oxidation. Overall, the attack of free radicals on nitrogen-containing heterocycles promotes the conversion of fuel-N to HCN, the adsorption of which on char surfaces can further enhance the heterogeneous reduction in a lean oxygen atmosphere. The work here provides a novel route for developing high-efficiency and low-NOx combustion technologies.</description>

                Summary Some cyanobacteria can grow photoautotrophically or photomixotrophically by using simultaneously CO 2 and glucose. The switch between these trophic modes and the role of glycogen, their main carbon storage macromolecule, was investigated. We analysed the effect of glucose addition on the physiology, metabolic and photosynthetic state of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and mutants lacking phosphoglucomutase and ADP&#8208;glucose pyrophosphorylase, with limitations in glycogen synthesis. Glycogen acted as a metabolic buffer: glucose addition increased growth and glycogen reserves in the wild&#8208;type (WT), but arrested growth in the glycogen synthesis mutants. Already 30 min after glucose addition, metabolites from the Calvin&#8211;Benson&#8211;Bassham cycle and the oxidative pentose phosphate shunt increased threefold more in the glycogen synthesis mutants than the WT. These alterations substantially affected the photosynthetic performance of the glycogen synthesis mutants, as O 2 evolution and CO 2 uptake were both impaired. We conclude that glycogen synthesis is essential during transitions to photomixotrophy to avoid metabolic imbalance that induces inhibition of electron transfer from PSII and subsequently accumulation of reactive oxygen species, loss of PSII core proteins, and cell death. Our study lays foundations for optimising photomixotrophy&#8208;based biotechnologies through understanding the coordination of the crosstalk between photosynthetic electron transport and metabolism.</description>

      <title>Effect of lapped sequence on corrosion behavior and mechanism of pure titanium/galvanized steel joint using cold metal transfer joining technology</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpvp.2024.105203</link>

                Titanium/steel joints are widely used in petrochemical, nuclear and aerospace industries. The lapped sequence of dissimilar metal lapped joints can considerably affect their mechanical and corrosion properties. In the study, the microstructure and corrosion behavior of pure titanium/galvanized steel dissimilar cold metal transfer welding joints with different lapped sequences were investigated using microscopic examination, immersion and electrochemical corrosion tests. Pure titanium/galvanized steel joints can be defined as Ti/steel joint (the Ti sheet on top of the steel sheet) or steel/Ti joint (the steel sheet on top of the Ti sheet). The results showed that the corrosion resistance of the Ti/steel joint was poorer than that of the steel/Ti joint in artificial seawater solution because of the formation of larger intermetallics in the weld metal of the Ti/steel joint. Galvanic corrosion occurred in both the Ti/steel and steel/Ti joints. The interface between the galvanized steel base metal and weld metal was the weakest zone in both joints. Moreover, the corrosion mechanisms of the Ti/steel and steel/Ti joints were similar, the reactions were the reduction of oxygen and the evolution of H2 at the cathode. Anodic reactions included the oxidation of metal ions, the formation of TiO2 oxide film and the oxidation of the intermetallics. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of the corrosion behavior of titanium/steel lapped joints under artificial seawater conditions.</description>

                Background: Acute leukemia is the result of clonal transformation and proliferation of a hematopoietic progenitor giving rise to poorly differentiated neoplastic cells. Reactive oxygen species play a role in maintaining the quiescence, self-renewal, and long-term survival of hematopoietic stem cells, but it is unclear how they would affect disease onset and progression. The aim is to evaluate, at the transcriptional and systemic level, the oxidative-inflammatory status in newly diagnosis acute leukemia patients. Methods: Seventy acute leukemia patients [26 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 13 Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL), and 31 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)] and forty-one healthy controls were analyzed. Malondialdehyde and catalase activity were evaluated. Gene expression of NRF2, SOD, PRDX2, CAT, IL-6, and TNF-&#945; was analyzed by real-time PCR. Results: Malondialdehyde concentration was similar in all groups studied. Catalase activity was significantly higher in AML and APL patients compared to controls, while ALL showed similar activity to the healthy group. NRF2, CAT, and PRDX2 expression levels were similar between groups, SOD expression was downregulated in all acute leukemia patients. TNF-&#945; expression was lower in AML groups than in healthy individuals, and IL-6 mRNA expression was downregulated in ALL and APL. Conclusion: This is the first report that correlates transcriptional and systemic parameters associated with the oxidative inflammatory status in newly diagnosed acute leukemia. Some of the parameters evaluated could be used as biomarkers in the selection of an effective therapeutic strategy and will open new directions for the follow-up and evolution of this disease.</description>

                Abstract Dual-atom catalysts (DACs) with synergetic dinuclear active sites, have the potential to break the linear scaling relationship of the well-established single-atom catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR); however, the design of DACs with rationalized local microenvironment for high activity and selectivity remains a blind area and is great challenge. Herein, we reported a design of bisalphen ladder polymer with well-defined densely populated binuclear cobalt sites that in suit growth on Ketjenblack substrates (CoCo-BiSalphen@KB). The strong electron coupling effect between the fully-conjugated ladder structure with carbon substrates induces the low-to-high spin transition for the 3d electron of Co(II), activating O-O bond through the side-on overlapping and enhancing the electron transfer between the cobalt center and reactants/intermediates. In situ techniques and density functional theory calculations revealed the dynamic evolution of Co2N4O2 active sites and reaction intermediates. In alkaline conditions, the catalyst presented impressive ORR activity featuring an ultrahigh onset potential of 1.10 V and a remarkable half-wave potential of 1.00 V, insignificant decay after 30,000 cycles, which pushes the overpotential boundaries of ORR electrocatalysis to an unprecedented low level. This work provides a new platform for designing high-efficiency dual atom catalysts with well-defined coordination and electronic structures in energy conversion technologies.</description>

      <title>Simulations predict preferred Mg2+ coordination in a nonenzymatic primer extension reaction center</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2024.04.032</link>

                The mechanism by which genetic information was copied prior to the evolution of ribozymes is of great interest because of its importance to the origin of life. The most effective known process for the nonenzymatic copying of an RNA template is primer extension by a two-step pathway in which 2-aminoimidazole activated nucleotides first react with each other to form an imidazolium-bridged intermediate that subsequently reacts with the primer. Reaction kinetics, structure-activity relationships, and X-ray crystallography have provided insight into the overall reaction mechanism, but many puzzles remain. In particular, high concentrations of Mg2+ are required for efficient primer extension, but the mechanism by which Mg2+ accelerates primer extension remains unknown. By analogy with the mechanism of DNA and RNA polymerases, a role for Mg2+ in facilitating the deprotonation of the primer 3&#8242;-hydroxyl is often assumed, but no catalytic metal ion is seen in crystal structures of the primer extension complex. To explore the potential effects of Mg2+ binding in the reaction center, we performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of a series of modeled complexes in which a Mg2+ ion was placed in the reaction center with inner sphere coordination to different sets of functional groups. Our simulations suggest that coordination of a Mg2+ ion to both O3&#8242; of the terminal primer nucleotide and the pro-Sp non-bridging oxygen of the reactive phosphate of an imidazolium-bridged dinucleotide would help to preorganize the structure of the primer/template substrate complex to favor the primer-extension reaction. Our results suggest that the catalytic metal ion may play an important role in overcoming electrostatic repulsion between a deprotonated O3&#8242; and the reactive phosphate of the bridged dinucleotide, and lead to testable predictions of the mode of Mg2+ binding that is most relevant to catalysis of primer extension.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the expression of the unspecific peroxygenase in Komagataella phaffii through a combination strategy</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1007/s00253-024-13166-7</link>
      <description>Ya&#8208;Ping Xue, Ya&#8208;Ping Xue, Ya&#8208;Ping Xue, Ya&#8208;Ping Xue, Ya&#8208;Ping Xue, Applied microbiology and biotechnology. 108(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396676995

                The unspecific peroxygenase (UPO) from Cyclocybe aegerita (AaeUPO) can selectively oxidize C-H bonds using hydrogen peroxide as an oxygen donor without cofactors, which has drawn significant industrial attention. Many studies have made efforts to enhance the overall activity of AaeUPO expressed in Komagataella phaffii by employing strategies such as enzyme-directed evolution, utilizing appropriate promoters, and screening secretion peptides. Building upon these previous studies, the objective of this study was to further enhance the expression of a mutant of AaeUPO with improved activity (PaDa-I) by increasing the gene copy number, co-expressing chaperones, and optimizing culture conditions. Our results demonstrated that a strain carrying approximately three copies of expression cassettes and co-expressing the protein disulfide isomerase showed an approximately 10.7-fold increase in volumetric enzyme activity, using the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as the substrate. After optimizing the culture conditions, the volumetric enzyme activity of this strain further increased by approximately 48.7%, reaching 117.3 U/mL. Additionally, the purified catalytic domain of PaDa-I displayed regioselective hydroxylation of R-2-phenoxypropionic acid. The results of this study may facilitate the industrial application of UPOs. KEY POINTS: &#8226; The secretion of the catalytic domain of PaDa-I can be significantly enhanced through increasing gene copy numbers and co-expressing of protein disulfide isomerase. &#8226; After optimizing the culture conditions, the volumetric enzyme activity can reach 117.3 U/mL, using the 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) as the substrate. &#8226; The R-2-phenoxypropionic acid can undergo the specific hydroxylation reaction catalyzed by catalytic domain of PaDa-I, resulting in the formation of R-2-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)propionic acid.</description>

      <title>Identification and characterization of the CRK gene family in the wheat genome and analysis of their expression profile in response to high temperature-induced male sterility</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.17370</link>
      <description>Hongzhan Liu, Xiaoyi Li, Zujun Yin, Junmin Hu, Liuyong Xie, Huanhuan Wu, Seung Hoon Han, Bing Li, Huifang Zhang, Chaoqiong Li, Lili Li, Fuli Zhang, Guangxuan Tan, PeerJ. 12(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4396704694

                Cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (CRKs) play many important roles during plant development, including defense responses under both biotic and abiotic stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, callose deposition and programmed cell death (PCD). However, there are few studies on the involvement of the CRK family in male sterility due to heat stress in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). In this study, a genome-wide characterization of the CRK family was performed to investigate the structural and functional attributes of the wheat CRKs in anther sterility caused by heat stress. A total of 95 CRK genes were unevenly distributed on 18 chromosomes, with the most genes distributed on chromosome 2B. Paralogous homologous genes with Ka/Ks ratios less than 1 may have undergone strong purifying selection during evolution and are more functionally conserved. The collinearity analysis results of CRK genes showed that wheat and Arabidopsis ( A. thaliana ), foxtail millet, Brachypodium distachyon ( B. distachyon ), and rice have three, 12, 15, and 11 pairs of orthologous genes, respectively. In addition, the results of the network interactions of genes and miRNAs showed that five miRNAs were in the hub of the interactions map, namely tae-miR9657b-5p, tae-miR9780, tae-miR9676-5p, tae-miR164, and tae-miR531. Furthermore, qRT-PCR validation of the six TaCRK genes showed that they play key roles in the development of the mononuclear stage anthers, as all six genes were expressed at highly significant levels in heat-stressed male sterile mononuclear stage anthers compared to normal anthers. We hypothesized that the TaCRK gene is significant in the process of high-temperature-induced sterility in wheat based on the combination of anther phenotypes, paraffin sections, and qRT-PCR data. These results improve our understanding of their relationship.</description>

      <title>Maturation from oceanic arcs to continental crust: Insights from Paleozoic magmatism in West Junggar, NW China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2024.104795</link>

                Understanding the processes involved in the transformation of juvenile basaltic oceanic arc crust into mature continental crust remains a key challenge in Earth sciences. In this contribution, we present a comprehensive synthesis of in situ zircon UPb age and HfO isotope data for Paleozoic intrusions within the West Junggar oceanic arc, NW China. Our study reveals four distinct pulses of magmatic activity: Early Cambrian to Early Ordovician (515 to 486 Ma); Late Ordovician to Middle Devonian (445 to 392 Ma); Early Carboniferous (343 to 310 Ma) and Late Carboniferous to Middle Permian (309 to 259 Ma). These pulses have varied spatial and temporal distributions. All magmatic rocks display consistently high zircon Hf and whole-rock Nd isotope values, but substantial variations in zircon O isotopes. There are two groups of intrusions: those with high zircon &#948;18O (&gt;6.5&#8240;) and those with mantle-like zircon &#948;18O (ca. 5.5&#8240;). The high zircon &#948;18O intrusions are predominantly concentrated in the southern West Junggar and their Hf and Nd isotopes indicate the involvement of supracrustal material and juvenile basaltic crust in their petrogenesis. Binary mixing calculations indicate a contribution from the supracrustal rocks ranging from 10% to 50%. The intrusions with mantle-like zircon &#948;18O are found primarily in northern West Junggar with a small amount occurring in southern West Junggar. The intrusions record a variety of magma sources and processes as demonstrated by HfO isotope and geochemical data. These data indicate partial melting of metasomatized depleted mantle, mixing of depleted mantle and juvenile crust, and partial melting of trapped juvenile oceanic crust or mafic lower crust. Hf model ages reveal significant crustal growth in the West Junggar, characterized by three distinct episodes of crust formation occurring at approximately 656&#8211;684 Ma, 524&#8211;536 Ma, and 441&#8211;471 Ma, involving periodic remelting of igneous material derived from a depleted mantle source. This newly-formed crust maintains a mantle-like oxygen isotope composition despite being repeatedly sampled by magmas for up to 0.26 Ga. Since the timing of crustal growth occurred independently of the major magmatic pulses, the latter reflect primarily reworking and remelting processes. Two significant episodes of magmatic activity, the late Silurian to early Devonian and the late Carboniferous to early Permian, preserve a signature of ocean ridge subduction. High-temperature magmatism during these periods promoted extensive melting of the mafic lower crust, oceanic crust, and supracrustal rocks, leading to the compositional transformation from basaltic to felsic continental crust. This comprehensive compilation provides valuable insights into granite petrogenesis, crustal evolution, and the diverse processes involved in the maturation of oceanic arc crust and its contribution to continental crust formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>The NIRVANDELS Survey: the stellar and gas-phase mass-metallicity
  relations of star-forming galaxies at z = 3.5</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2405.00774</link>

                We present determinations of the gas-phase and stellar metallicities of a sample of 65 star-forming galaxies at $z \simeq 3.5$ using rest-frame far-ultraviolet (FUV) spectroscopy from the VANDELS survey in combination with follow-up rest-frame optical spectroscopy from VLT/KMOS and Keck/MOSFIRE. We infer gas-phase oxygen abundances ($Z_{\mathrm{g}}$; tracing O/H) via strong optical nebular lines and stellar iron abundances ($Z_{\star}$; tracing Fe/H) from full spectral fitting to the FUV continuum. Our sample spans the stellar mass range $8.5 &lt; \mathrm{log}(M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}) &lt; 10.5$ and shows clear evidence for both a stellar and gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR). We find that our O and Fe abundance estimates both exhibit a similar mass-dependence, such that $\mathrm{Fe/H}\propto M_{\star}^{0.30\pm0.11}$ and $\mathrm{O/H}\propto M_{\star}^{0.32\pm0.09}$. At fixed $M_{\star}$ we find that, relative to their solar values, O abundances are systematically larger than Fe abundances (i.e., $\alpha$-enhancement).We estimate an average enhancement of $\mathrm{(O/Fe)} = 2.65 \pm 0.16 \times \mathrm{(O/Fe)_\odot}$ which appears to be independent of $M_{\star}$. We employ analytic chemical evolution models to place a novel constraint on the strength of galactic-level outflows via the mass-outflow factor ($\eta$). We show that outflow efficiencies that scale as $\eta \propto M_{\star}^{-0.32}$ can simultaneously explain the functional form of of the stellar and gas-phase MZR, as well as the degree of $\alpha$-enhancement at fixed Fe/H. Our results add further evidence to support a picture in which $\alpha$-enhanced abundance ratios are ubiquitous in high-redshift star-forming galaxies, as expected for young systems whose interstellar medium is primarily enriched by core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>Microbial nitrogen transformation processes across environments: more than just a cycle</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tim.2024.04.006</link>

                Nitrogen (N) is unique amongst the bioessential elements in that its major reservoir is in the atmosphere, as triple-bonded N2, which comprises 78% of the atmosphere. Breaking the extremely strong triple bond of N2 is challenging; in nature, only the microbial nitrogenase enzyme is known to be capable of this reaction, and nitrogenase is by far the dominant source of N2 fixation on the modern Earth. Abiotic N2 fixation is found only in extremely high energy situations, namely lightning bolts, and industrial N2 fixation for fertilizer production. Indeed, N is one of the elemental cycles most influenced by human activities; in a little over a century, humans have more than doubled fixed N2 in the environment due to industrial N2 fixation via the Haber&#8211;Bosch process. Excess fertilizer use and subsequent runoff contributes to eutrophication of waterways and emissions of greenhouse gases, namely nitrous oxide. While humans have radically changed the N cycle in the Anthropocene, it was single-celled microorganisms that established the nitrogen cycle and its enzymatic processes over Earth's history [1.St&#252;eken E.E. et al.The evolution of Earth's biogeochemical nitrogen cycle.Earth Sci. Rev. 2016; 160: 220-239Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar]. Once fixed into 'reactive' N (the term for all forms of N in the environment except N2), N cycles through dozens of inorganic and organic nitrogenous forms on the Earth's surface [2.Zhang X. et al.Global nitrogen cycle: critical enzymes, organisms, and processes for nitrogen budgets and dynamics.Chem. Rev. 2020; 120: 5308-5351Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar]. With every passing year, it becomes clearer that the so-called N cycle, often drawn as a circle, is instead a tangled web. While relatively stable chemical species like nitrate and ammonium are often the focus of attention, highly reactive intermediates &#8211; such as nitric oxide, hydroxylamine, and even hydrazine (rocket fuel) &#8211; are increasingly recognized as the linchpins in the N web but often experience cryptic cycling due to their reactivity. Even more complexity is introduced when one considers the fact that the N web is woven by biotic&#8211;abiotic couplings, such as chemodenitrification, in which products of microbial metabolism react with ferrous iron to produce gaseous N. Biotic transformations in the N cycle are primarily catalyzed by metalloenzymes, many of which contain iron, molybdenum, and/or copper cofactors [3.Lycus P. et al.Structural biology of proteins involved in nitrogen cycling.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2023; 74102278Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar]. For instance, alternative forms of nitrogenase (vanadium&#8211;iron or iron&#8211;iron) have been detected, but they are rare in natural environments. Intriguingly, molybdenum&#8211;iron nitrogenase is by far the dominant form, even in environments in which vanadium is present at higher concentrations than molybdenum [4.Warren M.J. et al.Molybdenum-based diazotrophy in a sphagnum peatland in northern Minnesota.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2017; 83e01174&#8211;17Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar]. In some environments, such as the low-chlorophyll, high-nitrate regions of the oceans, scarcity of trace metals, particularly iron, limits photosynthesis and nitrate assimilation by phytoplankton. Scientific disciplines separate the N cycle/web into soil, freshwater, marine, and anthropogenic compartments; microbial life, of course, ignores all such designations and N freely flows across such artificial boundaries. While challenging, enhanced communication across disciplinary spheres is vital for expediting scientific discoveries and applications. Towards that end, Trends in Microbiology has joined forces with iScience to present a special issue on 'Nitrogen Cycling Across Environments' that explores microbial N processes across aquatic and terrestrial environments, with a focus on lessons that can be gained from cross-communication across the fields. The N cycle is replete with examples of how processes discovered in one environment have informed another. This is particularly common in the study of wastewater engineering, in which a large priority is conversion of reactive N from human and animal waste to N gas while minimizing greenhouse gas emissions, also known as biological N removal [5.Winkler M.K. Straka L. New directions in biological nitrogen removal and recovery from wastewater.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2019; 57: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar]. Anaerobic oxidation of ammonium (anammox) was first characterized in samples of wastewater sludge but has since been discovered in soil as well. More recently, the pathway of complete nitrification, thus far restricted to terrestrial environments, was discovered in other samples from engineered, aquatic systems. Crosstalk between fields can also bring new ideas about potential interactions between species in the N cycle. Interactions between diazotrophic bacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes in root nodules (e.g., in legumes and alder trees) have long been studied in soils but remained relatively unknown in the ocean until the discovery of UCYN-A unicellular cyanobacteria in symbiosis with haptophyte algae. Likewise, while non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs have long been known to be key for terrestrial N2 fixation, they were only relatively recently discovered in the ocean. The role of viruses in the nitrogen cycle remains understudied across ecosystems. Many technological challenges hinder progress, such as challenges cultivating and genetic systems for environmentally key species and applying limited rate measurements across scales. Methods for microbial cultivation and pathway characterization are increasingly complex, which poses problems for widespread access to study of the cycle. This special issue tackles these questions and more. Three of the articles focus on the entry of N into the cycle via N2 fixation catalyzed by nitrogenase. Chakraborty et al. discuss engineering N2-fixing bacteria to increase N yield to crops, Zehr and Capone highlight recent developments and challenges in marine N2 fixation research, and Rucker and Ka&#231;ar describe interconnections between metal cycles and N cycles. Bowen et al. highlight salt marshes as an interface between terrestrial and marine realms, both subject to anthropogenic disturbances, which remove excess N prior to its entry into marine habitats. Deutsch and colleagues tackle the temperature dependence of biological N2 fixation and uncover a relationship that is similar across terrestrial and marine environments. Beeckman et al. critically examine the role of nitrification inhibitors that are used to relieve the deleterious effects associated with excess nitrification, providing insights into their applicability in the field. Sagha&#239; and Hallin review ammonifiers in terrestrial and aquatic environments. The article looks at enzymes involved in the reduction of nitrate and nitrite to ammonia with a particular focus on the widely used marker, NrfA. The special issue also highlights two recently published articles on the influence of tillage practices on the rhizosphere [6.Behr J.H. et al.Long-term conservation tillage with reduced nitrogen fertilization intensity can improve winter wheat health via positive plant&#8211;microorganism feedback in the rhizosphere.FEMS Microb. Ecol. 2024; 100fiae003Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar] and the identification of Methylomirabilis bacterium capable of methane-dependent complete denitrification [7.Yao X. et al.Methane-dependent complete denitrification by a single Methylomirabilis bacterium.Nat. Microbiol. 2024; 9: 464-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. Finally, our Microbe of the Month for this special issue is the diazotrophic Gram-negative bacterium, Bradyrhizobium japonicum (diazoefficiens), covered by Ong and O'Brian. We would also like to draw your attention to the articles published in iScience that are part of this interdisciplinary collection (https://www.cell.com/cp/collections-microbial-nitrogen-transformation). Christensen and Rousk review global sources of N2O emissions, identifying those which are influenced by anthropogenic activities, and highlighting agricultural systems with the potential for mitigation. Derikvand and colleagues focus on the microbial ecology of engineered aquaponic systems, investigating microbial community dynamics and ammonia removal in response to ammonia-oxidizing inocula and changing pH. While dozens of microbial reactions in the N cycle have been discovered, many more exergonic and disproportionation reactions, and the enzymes that catalyze them, await unearthing [8.Kuypers M.M.M. et al.The microbial nitrogen-cycling network.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2018; 16: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar]. Crystal structures of membrane proteins such as ammonia monooxygenase have been notoriously difficult to solve but are essential for mechanistic understanding of nitrogen cycle processes [9.Bradely B.T. et al.Integrated structural biology and molecular ecology of N-cycling enzymes from ammonia-oxidizing archaea.Environ. Microbiol. 2017; 5: 484-491Google Scholar]. Forms of oxygen-resistant enzymes previously thought to be extremely oxygen sensitive have also been discovered, such as the atypical form of nitrous oxide reductase, and surely many more remain to be found [10.Simon J. Klotz M.G. Diversity and evolution of bioenergetic systems involved in microbial nitrogen compound transformations.BBA-Bioenergetics. 2013; 2: 114-135Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar]. As we venture even further into the Anthropocene, the importance of studying N cycling across environments subject to global climate change becomes ever more important. Nitrogen is a bioessential element with an almost limitless supply from the atmosphere, yet conversion to reactive N currently relies on fossil fuels and results in eutrophication and greenhouse emissions. Harnessing insights from microbes that drive the N cycle to tackle these environmental challenges will be increasingly key going forward [11.Stein L.Y. Klotz M.G. The nitrogen cycle.Curr.
