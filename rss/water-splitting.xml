                Electrolysis of water is one of low-cost green hydrogen production technologies. The challenge is designing and developing low-cost and high-activity catalysts. Herein, we present a strategy to fabricate flexible electrocatalysts based on nickel-iron (NiFe) alloy coatings. NiFe coatings were plated on the flexible copper-coated polyimide surface (Cu/PI) using the low-cost and straightforward electroless metal plating method and morpholine borane as a reducing agent. It was found that Ni90Fe10, Ni80Fe20, Ni60Fe40, and Ni30Fe70 coatings were deposited on the Cu/PI surface, then the concentration of Fe2+ in the plating solution was 0.5 mM, 1 mM, 5 mM, and 10 mM, respectively. Morphology, structure, and composition of NixFey/Cu/PI catalysts have been examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), whereas their activity has been investigated for hydrogen evolution (HER) and oxygen evolution (OER) reactions in 1 M KOH using linear sweep voltammetry (LSVs). It was found that the Ni80Fe20/Cu/PI catalyst exhibited the lowest overpotential value of &#8211;202.7 mV for the HER to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 compared to Ni90Fe10/Cu/PI (&#8211;211.9 mV), Ni60Fe40/Cu/PI (&#8211;276.3 mV), Ni30Fe70/Cu/PI (&#8211;278.4 mV), and Ni (&#8722;303.4 mV). On the other hand, the lowest OER overpotential (344.7 mV) was observed for the Ni60Fe40/Cu/PI catalyst to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2 as compared with the Ni30Fe70 (369.9 mV), Ni80Fe20 (450.2 mV), Ni90Fe10 (454.2 mV) coatings, and Ni (532.1 mV). The developed Ni60Fe40/Cu/PI catalyst exhibit a cell potential of 1.85 V at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. The obtained catalysts seem to be suitable flexible catalysts for HER and OER in alkaline media.</description>

                The efficient anion exchange membrane water electrolysis is challenging with low cell voltage and long-term stability at large current density, due to the unstable anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Fe-based electrocatalysts are potential candidates for the anodic OER. In Fe-based materials, iron oxides always show better stability in alkaline solution but lower OER activity. However, the catalysts in previous study are difficult to continuously and effectively activate iron oxides supported on carbon during electrocatalysis. Herein, a new class of electrocatalyst: bamboo-like carbon nanotubes (B-CNT)-encapsulated Fe</description>

      <title>Maximizing Bifunctionality for Overall Water Splitting by Integrating H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Spillover and Oxygen Vacancies in CoPBO/Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Composite Catalyst</title>

                In the pursuit of utilizing renewable energy sources for green hydrogen (H 2 ) production, alkaline water electrolysis has emerged as a key technology. To improve the reaction rates of overall water electrolysis and simplify electrode manufacturing, development of bifunctional electrocatalysts is of great relevance. Herein, CoPBO/Co 3 O 4 is reported as a binary composite catalyst comprising amorphous (CoPBO) and crystalline (Co 3 O 4 ) phases as a high&#8208;performing bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline water electrolysis. Owing to the peculiar properties of CoPBO and Co 3 O 4 , such as complementing Gibbs free energy values for H&#8208;adsorption (&#916; G H ) and relatively smaller difference in their work functions (&#916;&#934;), the composite exhibits H 2 spillover (HS) mechanism to facilitate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The outcome is manifested in the form of a low HER overpotential of 65 mV (at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ). Moreover, an abundant amount of surface oxygen vacancies (O v ) are observed in the same CoPBO/Co 3 O 4 composite that facilitates oxygen evolution reaction (OER) as well, leading to a mere 270 mV OER overpotential (at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ). The present work showcases the possibilities to strategically design non&#8208;noble composite catalysts that combine the advantages of HS phenomenon as well as O v to achieve new record performances in alkaline water electrolysis.</description>

                Abstract Interface engineering is an efficient strategy to create high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for water splitting. In the present work, CeO 2 @CoSe 2 nanoneedle on carbon cloth (CeO 2 @CoSe 2 /CC) demonstrates high efficiency for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and water splitting. CeO 2 with abundant O vacancies facilitates the adsorption of OH &#8722; and boosts the reconstruction of CoSe 2 into CoOOH at lower potentials. The in situ generated active CeO 2 @CoOOH heterointerface upshifts the d&#8208;band center of Co site, thereby decreasing the free energy of rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) ( * O to * OOH) during the OER process. It delivers a low OER overpotential of 245 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . CeO 2 @CoSe 2 /CC is also found to be active for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER, 138 mV overpotential at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ), profiting from CeO 2 &#8208;facilitated * H 2 O dissociation and * H adsorption on CoSe 2 . The overall water splitting is achieved over the CeO 2 @CoSe 2 /CC bifunctional electrode with a low electrolysis voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work offers valuable insights into CeO 2 &#8208;assisted surface reconstruction as well as provides water electrolysis catalysts through interface engineering.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Interplay between Fe&#8208;based Perovskite Oxides and Co in Electrolyte for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202401982</link>
      <description>Yuta Inoue, Yuto Miyahara, Kohei Miyazaki, Changhee Lee, Ryo Sakamoto, Takeshi Abe, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404228579

                Perovskite oxides have been extensively investigated as active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline solution. While the OER activity of some perovskite oxides is positively influenced by Fe ions in the electrolyte, the impact of other transition metal ions in the electrolyte remains unclear. In this study, we compared the influence of Co ions intentionally added to the electrolyte on the OER activities of two Fe-based perovskite oxides (Ba0.5Sr0.5FeO3-&#948; and LaFeO3). While the OER activity of Ba0.5Sr0.5FeO3-&#948; is significantly enhanced by adding Co ions to the electrolyte, LaFeO3 showed little difference in the OER behavior between the Co-free and Co-containing electrolytes. In the case of Ba0.5Sr0.5FeO3-&#948;, an amorphous layer was formed, and the Co ions from the electrolyte were incorporated on the surface as a result of OER cycling. On the other hand, Co ions were also detected on the surface of LaFeO3, but its crystalline structure remains unchanged during the OER. Our study suggests that synergistic interplay between the perovskite oxides undergoing a structural transformation at the surface and transition metal ions in the electrolyte can improve the OER activity.</description>

                In computational heterogeneous catalysis, Sabatier's principle-based activity volcano plots provide an intuitive guide to catalyst design but impose a fundamental constraint on the maximum achievable catalytic performance. Recently, subnano clusters have emerged as an exciting platform, offering high noble metal utilization and superior performance for various reactions compared to extended surfaces, reflecting a complex structure-activity relationship in the non-scalable regime. However, understanding their non-monotonic catalytic activity, attributed to the large configurational space and their fluxional identity, poses a formidable challenge. Here, we present a machine learning (ML) framework that captures the non-monotonic trends in oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity at the subnanometer scale, attributed to their dynamic fluxional characteristics. We demonstrate a size-dependent shifting and reshaping of the ORR activity volcano, with Au replacing Pt at the peak. Leveraging only upon the non-</description>

                Oxygen evolution reactions (OER), commonly employed in applications such as metal-air batteries, water electrolysis, fuel cells, etc. , often suffer from slow kinetics, thus leading to ultra-high potentials that severely affect device energy efficiency. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have garnered massive attention as electrodes for OER, benefiting from their highly ordered porous frameworks, abundant accessible active metal sites, and adjustable lattice structures. However, using powdered MOFs in OER poses a challenge, limiting the exposure of numerous active sites and resulting in suboptimal efficiency. To address this limitation, the trend towards designing MOF-based self-supported electrodes with enhanced contact between MOFs and the current collector has gained considerable attention for OER applications. This review highlights recent advancements and future prospects in developing MOF-based self-supported electrodes for OER. We delve into various aspects, including preparation methods, optimization strategies, catalytic efficiencies, and OER mechanisms with MOF-based electrocatalysts. Furthermore, we explore the existing challenges associated with MOF-based self-supported electrodes for OER. This comprehensive overview provides valuable insights into the evolving landscape of MOF-based materials in advancing OER.</description>

                Activating the lattice oxygen can significantly improve the kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER), however, it often results in reduced stability due to the bulk structure degradation. Here, we develop a spinel Fe0.3Co0.9Cr1.8O4 with active lattice oxygen by high-throughput methods, achieving high OER activity and stability, superior to the benchmark IrO2. The oxide exhibits an ultralow overpotential (190 mV at 10 mA cm-2) with outstanding stability for over 170 h at 100 mA cm-2. Soft X-ray absorption- and Raman-spectroscopies, combined with 18O isotope-labelling experiments, reveal that lattice oxygen activation is driven by Cr oxidation, which induces a cation migration from CrO6 octahedrons to CrO4 tetrahedrons. The geometry conversion creates accessible non-bonding oxygen states, crucial for lattice oxygen oxidation. Upon oxidation, peroxo O-O bond is formed and further stabilized by Cr6+ (CrO4 tetrahedra) via dimerization. This work establishes a new approach for designing efficient catalysts that feature active and stable lattice oxygen without compromising structural integrity.</description>

                Abstract Nonprecious metal&#8208;based 2D materials have shown promising electrocatalytic activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the catalytically active sites of 2D materials are mainly presented at the edge, and most of their basal planes are still catalytically inactive, which turns into a significant drawback on the catalytic efficiency. Here, a novel p&#8211;n heterojunction strategy is suggested that generates active sites on the basal plane of 2D NiFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (NiFe&#8208;LDH). The n&#8208;type NiFe&#8208;LDH is first grown on a nickel foam (NF) substrate, and p&#8208;type Co 3 O 4 nanocubes are deposited through a simple dip&#8208;coating method to fabricate a Co 3 O 4 /NiFe&#8208;LDH@NF p&#8211;n heterojunction electrode. As a result, electron transfer is induced at the interface of p&#8208;type Co 3 O 4 and n&#8208;type NiFe&#8208;LDH, which consequently promotes oxidation of the inert Ni 2+ state to a more catalytically active Ni 3+ state on the inert basal plane of NiFe&#8208;LDH. As&#8208;prepared Co 3 O 4 /NiFe&#8208;LDH@NF electrodes obtained enhanced OER performance showing a high current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 at 1.48 V (vs RHE) which outperforms that of pristine NiFe&#8208;LDH@NF. The utilization of the p&#8211;n junction concept will disclose a new strategy for modifying the electronic structure of the catalytically inactive basal plane and stimulating its electrocatalytic activity.</description>

                A comprehensive understanding of the electrode-electrolyte interface in energy conversion systems remains challenging due to the complex and multifaceted nature of interfacial processes. This complexity hinders the development of more efficient electrocatalysts. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach to the theoretical description of the OER process on nickel-iron-based oxyhydroxides ($\gamma$-Ni$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$OOH) electrodes in alkaline media as a model system. Multiple reaction pathways represented by the single- and dual-site mechanisms were investigated by taking into account the realistic structure of the catalyst, the doping, and the solvation effects using a simple and computationally feasible strategy. Accounting for the variable solvation effects considerably affects the predicted overpotential in a roughly linear relationship between overpotential and dielectric constant. By incorporating quantum chemical simulations with kinetic modeling, we demonstrate that tuning the local solvation environment can significantly enhance the OER activity, opening new routine ways for elucidation of the emerging issues of OER processes on transition metal oxide surfaces and design of cost-effective, efficient electrocatalytic systems.</description>

      <title>Metal Single Atom&#8208;Hydroxyl Incorporation in Poly(heptazine imide) to Create Active Sites for Photocatalytic Water Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202408436</link>
      <description>Wenxuan Hu, Aifeng Li, Haiping Li, Yu Wang, Zhenzhong Fan, Quanhua Deng, Guoan Wang, Yuguo Xia, Wanguo Hou, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404273304

                Abstract Poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) salts are extensively researched crystalline carbon nitride photocatalysts, but their photocatalytic water oxidation (PWO) performance is scarcely researched because of the difficulty in creating efficient active sites. Interference of metal ion (e.g., Na + and K + ) loss from the PHI salts in their PWO research has hardly been considered. Herein, metal single atom&#9472;OH (e.g., Co&#9472;OH) groups are incorporated into PHI to create efficient PWO active sites, via simple ion metathesis, hydrolysis, and deprotonation. The Co&#9472;OH modified PHI exhibits 9.3&#8208;fold higher PWO (oxygen evolution) activity than PHI, with an external quantum yield reaching 0.44% even at 600 nm. Excluding interference of the metal ion loss, the function of the Co&#9472;OH incorporation is evidenced mainly to facilitate the oxygen evolution reaction, as well as to promote photogenerated charge separation and raise visible light absorption, with the role of the OH especially revealed. Moreover, it is discovered that Na + loss from sodium PHI will decrease its PWO activity, protonation of PHI has a detrimental effect on its PWO performance, and some other metal single atom&#9472;OH incorporation in PHI can also enhance its PWO activity. Overall, this work provides a general way to create PWO active sites in PHI.</description>

                Abstract In recent years, there has been an increasing research focus on the luminol&#8211;H 2 O electrochemiluminescence (ECL) system due to its ability to address the instability and toxicity of H 2 O 2 , which are common issues associated with the conventional luminol&#8211;H 2 O 2 ECL system. To enhance the ECL efficiency of the luminol&#8211;H 2 O system, researchers have developed electrocatalytic materials with exceptional oxygen evolution reaction (OER) properties to facilitate water electrolysis into O 2 to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and act as co&#8208;reactant promoters. However, most of these materials are characterized by their nanoscale or microscale dimensions, resulting in relatively large sizes and low specific surface areas, which hinder the application of the luminol&#8211;H 2 O system. To address this challenge, nickel molybdate sub&#8208;1 nm nanowires (NiMoO 4 S1 NWs) with a large specific surface area is synthesized that can offer many active sites to enhance the performance of the OER to boost the ECL of luminol. This study demonstrates that the large amount of ROS generated by the OER of NiMoO 4 S1 NWs play a crucial role in enhancing the ECL intensity of luminol. Finally, a NiMoO 4 S1 NWs&#8208;based ECL biosensor for the highly sensitive detection of the nucleocapsid proteins of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 is successfully constructed.</description>

      <title>Engineering MXene Surface via Oxygen Functionalization and Au Nanoparticle Deposition for Enhanced Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smtd.202401569</link>
      <description>Mengrui Li, Xiaoxiao Dong, Qinzhu Li, Yaru Liu, Shuang Cao, Chun&#8208;Chao Hou, Tong Sun, Small Methods. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404287069

                Abstract MXene, a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides, presents promising applications in electrocatalysis. Maximizing its large surface area is key to developing efficient non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, oxygen&#8208;functionalized Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene (Ti 3 C 2 O x ) is synthesized and deposited gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) onto it, forming a novel composite material, Au&#8208;Ti 3 C 2 O x . By selectively removing other functional groups, mainly &#8208;O functional groups are retained on the surface, directing electron transfer from Au NPs to MXene due to electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI), thereby improving the catalytic activity of the MXene surface. Additionally, the interaction between Au NPs and &#8208;O functional groups further enhanced the overall catalytic activity, achieving an overpotential of 62 mV and a Tafel slope of 40.1 mV dec &#8722;1 at a current density of &#8722;10 mA cm &#8722;2 in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 solution. Density functional theory calculations and scanning electrochemical microscopy with &#8804;150 nm resolution confirmed the enhanced catalytic efficiency due to the specific interaction between Au NPs and Ti 3 C 2 O x . This work provides a surface modification strategy to fully utilize the MXene surface and enhance the overall catalytic activity of MXene&#8208;based catalysts.</description>

      <title>Fluorine&#8208;Induced Lattice Oxygen Participation in 2D Layered Double Hydroxide/MXene Hybrids for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>

                Abstract In oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the participation of lattice oxygen can break the limitation of adsorption evolution mechanism, but the activation of lattice oxygen remains a critical challenge. Herein, a surface fluorinated highly active 2D/2D FeNi layered double hydroxide/MXene (F&#8208;LDH/MX) is demonstrated, boosting OER with the enhanced lattice&#8208;oxygen&#8208;mediated path. The introduction of fluorine promotes the self&#8208;evolution of catalyst in an alkaline environment, even without an external current. It further accelerates the formation of active metal oxyhydroxides with abundant oxygen vacancies under the operating potential. The introduced oxygen vacancy activates the lattice oxygen, increasing the proportion of lattice oxygen mechanism in OER. Owing to the synergistic effects of the 2D/2D hierarchical structure and the modulated active surface, F&#8208;LDH/MX possesses excellent electrochemical performances, including a low overpotential of 251 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , a low Tafel slope of 40.28 mV dec &#8722;1 , and robust stability. The water electrolyzer system with F&#8208;LDH/MX as the anode offers the benchmark current density at a low cell voltage of 1.53 V, while the Zn&#8208;air battery with F&#8208;LDH/MX as the air electrode exhibits a higher power density of 75.43 mW cm &#8722;2 . This study presents a promising strategy to design highly active electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage.</description>

      <title>On the Quest for Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysts Based on Layered Double Hydroxides: An Electrochemical and Chemometric Combined Approach</title>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial process in various energy conversion and storage technologies, such as water electrolysis. Developing efficient and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts is essential to achieve the commercialization of devices for the transition toward sustainable energy solutions. Herein, ternary layer double hydroxides (LDHs) are synthesized and characterized as electrocatalysts for OER using a potentiodynamic electrochemical deposition method on Grafoil. A chemometric approach based on experimental design is employed to rationalize the effort in the investigation of the LDHs which are based on Ni, Co, and Fe. The deposited films are characterized using cyclic voltammetry and X&#8208;ray diffraction to determine peak currents and potentials, and crystal size. Furthermore, the electrocatalyst performances are assessed by linear sweep voltammetry in 1M KOH from which the Tafel slope and onset potential are calculated. The obtained data are used to derive models describing the material properties and electrocatalyst performance as a function of the electrolyte composition used during the LDHs electrodeposition. This study provides valuable insights into the relationship between the electrocatalyst composition and its OER activity, enabling the design of more efficient and sustainable electrochemical systems for energy applications.</description>

                In order to create new value in biomass production using sterile Ulva with high production efficiency, we selected sterile Ulva with high culture stability from the coast of Imari City in Japan and investigated the conditions for generating high concentrations of dissolved oxygen through photosynthesis using the sterile Ulva . In the cultivation of sterile Ulva , we investigated the conditions for generating high concentrations of dissolved oxygen (DO) by controlling conditions such as aeration, NO 3 &#8208;N concentration, and population density. As a result, we found that under the cultivation control conditions we found, DO reached about 3.8 times the saturation concentration after 3 h. It was found that this high level of DO can be maintained if the supersaturated DO seawater obtained here is properly sealed. Seawater containing high levels of DO is essential for the cultivation of oysters and shellfish, which also prefer a growth temperature of 20&#176;C&#8722;25&#176;C. Therefore, from the perspective of creating new value in biomass production, we developed a new system for simultaneously cultivating sterile Ulva and cultivating oysters.</description>

                Dual&#8208;atom catalysts with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal sites embedded in carbon can drive the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), and the further improvement is limited by the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding energies in the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is promising to overcome this challenge, but has yet been verified since the lacking of bridge oxygen (O) in the rigid coordination environment of the metal centers. Here, we demonstrate that suitably tailored dual&#8208;atom catalysts of FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C can undergo out&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane reconstruction to form the both axial O and bridge O at the metal centers, and thus activate the LOM pathway. The tailored FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C with shortened Fe&#8211;N bonds also favor the ORR process, therefore is a promising dual&#8208;atom oxygen catalyst. The assembled rechargeable ZABs demonstrate a peak power density of 332 mW cm&#8722;2, and exhibit no notable decline after ~ 720 h of continuous cycling.</description>

      <title>Modulating Coordination&#8208;Driven Metal&#8208;Oxygen Interaction Triggers Oxygen Evolution in Polymorphic and High&#8208;Entropy Phosphate Electrocatalyst</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202416834</link>
      <description>Sampath Gayathri, Paulraj Arunkumar, Dipankar Saha, Durga P. Acharya, J. Karthikeyan, Jong Hun Han, Advanced Functional Materials. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404390058

                Abstract Engineering metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8210;O) interactions for catalyzing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) by tuning the coordination geometry of metal sites is crucial for improving catalytic performance, which remains unexplored, especially in structurally diverse phosphate&#8208;based catalysts. Herein, two NaCoPO 4 (NCP) polymorphs with distinct metal coordinations: orthorhombic&#8208; Pnma (CoO 6 ) and hexagonal&#8208;P 6 5 (CoO 4 ) denoted as O&#8208;NCP and H&#8208;NCP, respectively are synthesized through unique quenching&#8208;based synthesis, to investigate the impact of coordination geometry on M&#8210;O covalency and OER performance. The CoO 4 (H&#8208;NCP) polymorph delivered superior OER activity with low overpotential at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 (&#951; 10 = 303 mV) and long&#8208;term stability than CoO 6 &#8208;based O&#8208;NCP. Spectroscopic and computational studies linked the superior activity of CoO 4 to higher Co&#8210;O covalency, enhanced metal electronic states near the Fermi level, and improved electrochemical reconstruction. Further, M&#8210;O covalency regulated OER mechanism, where high&#8208;covalent CoO 4 follows conventional concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer pathway, while CoO 6 entails a non&#8208;concerted pathway, where the lattice oxygen participation remains unfavorable due to downshifted O 2p band center. Further, OER&#8208;active tetrahedral metal is demonstrated in a high&#8208;entropy catalyst requiring lower &#951; 10 of &#8776;284 mV. This study unlocks a unique strategy for designing next&#8208;generation OER catalysts with superior activity and durability, harnessing the interplay between metal coordination and metal&#8208;oxygen covalency.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Oxygen Evolution Performance of NiFeOx Semitransparent Electrocatalysts Applicable to Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting Device</title>

                In photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, semiconductor&#8208;based photoelectrodes can improve reaction rates and durability by incorporating cocatalysts that serve as active sites for the water splitting process. However, achieving both high light transmittance and efficient catalytic activity is essential for these cocatalysts. This study aimed to optimize the surface loading of semitransparent NiFeOx thin&#8208;film electrocatalysts to enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) rates while maintaining high light transmittance. NiFeOx thin films were deposited on fluorine&#8208;doped SnO2 (FTO) transparent conductive substrates, and the relationship between the NiFeOx loading amount (&#915;) and the OER rate was examined using electrochemical techniques. The OER rate of NiFeOx on FTO (NiFeOx/FTO) was the highest at a &#915; value of 0.20 &#956;mol cm&#8208;2. To further explore the connection between this optimized &#915; and PEC activity, the impact of &#915; on the PEC OER performance of visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 semitransparent photoanodes was evaluated as a model system. Applying the optimized &#915; of NiFeOx to modify the &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 surface also led to enhanced PEC OER performance. These findings highlight the critical role of surface design, specifically the optimization of cocatalyst loading and electrocatalytic activity, in improving PEC water splitting efficiency, providing valuable guidelines for future semitransparent photoelectrode development.</description>

                Abstract The application of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in the electro&#8208;catalysis of heterogeneous structures is limited by the problems of low electrical conductivity and poor mechanical strength due to the complex synthesis process, although their high specific surface area and controllable structure. In this study, a method involving metal precipitation and ligand reaction is used during the electrochemical corrosion of hydroxides/oxy&#8208;hydroxides to obtain ZIF&#8208;67 in situ. The in situ growth technology not only effectively addresses the bonding strength and material conductivity challenges in the heterostructure between MOFs and the substrate but also enhances the catalyst's surface area and activity. Additionally, the exposure and protection of Co 4+ by ZIF&#8208;67 contribute to the electrocatalyst's performance, demonstrating a low overpotential (&#951; 100 ) of 293 mV, a Tafel slope of 25.8 mV dec &#8722;1 , and a charge transfer resistance of 3.9 &#937;, with long&#8208;term robustness proven in continuous stability test exceeding 75 000 s under the superhigh current density of 500 mA cm &#8722;2 . This work on binder&#8208;free in situ growth of MOFs not only provides relevant theoretical insights and experimental experience for cost&#8208;effective and controllable production of MOF&#8208;based catalysts but also offers ideas for the development of future electrocatalysts by exploring the exposure and protection of active site using MOFs materials.</description>

                Thin &#64257;lms of bare and Se-containing tungsten trioxide (WO3) on AISI304 stainless steel were prepared by electrochemical deposition using peroxy-tungstate solutions. Cobalt-phosphate catalyst was photochemically deposited onto the surface of semiconductor particles in order to enhance their activity towards the oxygen evolution reaction. The photoelectrochemical properties of as-prepared electrodes were investigated in neutral 0.1 M phosphate buffer solutions. The voltammetric characteristics revealed that the presence of cobalt-based catalyst effectively changes the photoelectrocatalytic activity of WO3 and Se-WO3 particles.</description>

      <title>Vacancy enriched structurally modulated Nickel Ferrite for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cnma.202400480</link>

                Generation of clean hydrogen fuel from renewable source like water by electrocatalytic water splitting is an advanced energy conversion technology. The idea of water splitting attracts the researcher to focus on the synthesis of active and stable catalysts. We modulated nickel ferrite using different surfactants and developed an active two&#8208;dimensional (2D), economic and sturdy catalyst for the study of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in basic electrolytic solution. Nickel ferrite with CTAB named as NF(C), with ascorbic acid named as NF(A) and with oxalic acid named as NF(O) and Nickel ferrite without surfactant is named as NF. NF(O) having 2D structure shows better catalytic activity among all. The catalytic activity of NF(O) was further enhanced through reduction process. We reduced NF(O) using hydrazine hydrate along with ultrasonication power treatment to induce vacancy in the material namely Vo&#8208; NF(O). Vo&#8208; NF(O) exhibits low overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA/cm2 with Tafel slope of 25 mV/dec and stability of 18 h. Creation of vacancy boosts the catalytic activity of electrocatalyst by increasing the surface area and number of reactive sites of the catalyst which improve electrical conductivity, thus facilitating the transfer of charge.</description>

      <title>A general machine-learning framework for high-throughput screening for stable and efficient RuO2-based acidic oxygen evolution reaction catalysts</title>

                Abstract Doping guest elements is an effective way to increase activity and stability of RuO2 catalysts in acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, due to the vastness of doping space, it is challenging for either high-cost experiments or density functional theory (DFT) calculations to screen out the doped structures with the optimized catalytic performance. Herein, we reported a machine-learning (ML) framework that aims to realize high-throughput screening for both stability and activity of doped-RuO2 acidic OER catalysts from mono-doping to triple-doping at a low level of computational cost. Compared to the d-band theory and some other previous models, our ML model was constructed based on more general input features and realized higher prediction accuracy with mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 0.074, 0.142 and 0.082 eV for *OH, *O and *OOH adsorption, respectively. Through the ML models, three doping structures, Ru41Zn7O96, Ru41Zn4Fe3O96, and Ru39Zn4Cu4Co1O96 were found to possess the extraordinarily high stability and comparable or higher activity than the previously reported OER catalysts. This work provided an efficient study paradigm in fields of material screening and a useful guide for experimental synthesis.</description>

                Abstract We efficiently synthesize magnesium copper phosphate nanoparticles (MgCuPO4) doped with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) using a hydrothermal method for supercapattery and oxygen evolution reactions in KOH electrolyte. The GQDs-MgCuPO4 electrode has a high specific capacity (1188 Cg-1 at 1.0 Ag-1) and a high-rate capability (67%). The symmetric supercapattery (GQDs-MgCuPO4/GQDs-MgCuPO4) provides a staggering energy density of 46 Wh-kg-1, as well as a high-power density of 1300 W-kg-1 and a high cyclic stability of 93% after 10,000 cycles. Furthermore, it demonstrates high efficiency in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), with corresponding low overpotentials of 181 mV and 119 mV. The GQDs-MgCuPO4 stands out as a capable solution for various energy storage and conversion difficulties.</description>

      <title>In Situ Anodic Transition and Cathodic Contamination Affect the Overall Voltage of Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29225298</link>

                NiFe (oxy)hydroxide has been widely used as a benchmark anodic catalyst for oxygen evolution reactions (OERs) in alkaline water electrolysis devices; however, the energy saving actually takes contributions from both the anodic OER and cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this work, we observe the catalytic promotion upon the in situ-derived NiFe (oxy)hydroxide from the NiFe alloy monolithic electrode and also point out that the coupled nickel cathode is contaminated, leading to the loss of HER activity and a reduction in overall efficiency. It is found that Ni2+ and Fe3+ cations are inevitably detached from the anode into the electrolyte and electrodeposited on the nickel cathode after the three-month industrial simulation. This research presents the significant enhancement of the oxygen evolution catalysis using an in situ aging process and emphasizes that the catalytic application should not only be isolated on the half reaction, but a reasonable coupled electrode match to get rid of the contamination from the electrolyte is also of great significance to sufficiently present the intrinsic catalytic yielding for the real application.</description>

                The advancement of acid-stable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts is crucial for efficient hydrogen production through proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Unfortunately, the activity of electrocatalysts is constrained by a linear scaling relationship in the adsorbed evolution mechanism, while the lattice-oxygen-mediated mechanism undermines stability. Here, we propose a heterogeneous dual-site oxide pathway mechanism (OPM) that avoids these limitations through direct dioxygen radical coupling.

                In this work, we report the x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterization of a novel nanocomposite (photo)electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction, based on amorphous carbon nitride (aCN) functionalized with CuxO nanoparticles (NPs). The specimen has been fabricated employing two sequential plasma-assisted processes, involving the initial aCN deposition onto conductive glass via magnetron sputtering, followed by carbon nitride functionalization with CuxO (x = 1, 2) NPs by radio frequency-sputtering. The results reported herein include the survey spectrum and the high-resolution C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, Cu 2p, and Cu LMM signals. The most significant spectral features are analyzed and critically discussed.</description>

                Laser-structuring techniques like Direct Laser Interference Patterning show great potential for optimizing electrodes for water electrolysis. Therefore, a systematic experimental study based on statistical design of experiments is performed to analyze the influence of the spatial period and the aspect ratio between spatial period and structure depth on the electrode performance for pure Ni electrodes. The electrochemically active surface area could be increased by a factor of 12 compared to a non-structured electrode. For oxygen evolution reaction, a significantly lower onset potential and overpotential ($\approx$-164 mV at 100 mA/cm$^2$) is found. This is explained by a lower number of active nucleation sites and, simultaneously, larger detached bubbles, resulting in reduced electrode blocking and thus, lower ohmic resistance. It is found that the spatial distance between the laser-structures is the decisive processing parameter for the improvement of the electrode performance.</description>

                Rechargeable Zn-air batteries are considered to be an effective energy storage device due to their high energy density, environmental friendliness, and long operating life. Further progress on rechargeable Zn-air batteries with high energy density/power density is greatly needed to satisfy the increasing energy conversion and storage demands. This review summarizes the strategies proposed so far to pursue high-efficiency Zn-air batteries, including the aspects of the electrocatalysts (from noble metals to non-noble metals), the electrode chemistry (from the oxygen evolution reaction to the organic oxidation reaction), electrode engineering (from powdery to free-standing), aqueous electrolytes (from alkaline to non-alkaline) and the battery configuration (from liquid to flexible). An essential evaluation of electrochemistry is highlighted to solve the challenges in boosting the efficiency of rechargeable metal-air batteries. In the end, the perspective on current challenges and future research directions to promote the industrial application of rechargeable Zn-air batteries is provided.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Conceptual and Functional Factors Affecting the Effectiveness of Proton-Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/chemengineering8060116</link>

                Hydrogen has the potential to decarbonize the energy and industrial sectors in the future, mainly if it is generated by water electrolysis. The proton-exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) system is regarded as a propitious technology to produce green hydrogen from water using power supplied by renewable energy sources. It offers many benefits, such as high performance, high proton conductibility, quick response, compact size, and low working temperature. Many conceptual and functional parameters influence the effectiveness of PEM, including temperature, pressure of anode and cathode regions, water content and wideness of the layer, and cathode and anode exchange current density. In addition, the anodic half-reaction (known as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER)) and cathodic half-reaction (known as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)) perform an important function in the development of PEMWE. The current study aims to present these parameters and discuss their impacts on the performance of PEM. Also, the PEM efficiency is presented. The different methods used to enhance the scattering of OER electrocatalysts and minimize catalyst loading to minimize the price of PEMWE are also highlighted. Moreover, the alternative noble metals that could be used as electrocatalysts in HER and OER to minimize the cost of PEM are reviewed and presented.</description>

      <title>Targeted Topological Routine Regulation of RuNiOx Precursors for Excellent Alkaline Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cctc.202401664</link>
      <description>Ziyan Cai, Minghao Yang, Xiaoke Xu, Xiuming Bu, Chuqian Xiao, Yikai Yang, Di Yin, Yuxuan Zhang, Gao Wei, Xianying Wang, Johnny C. Ho, ChemCatChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404205798

                Designing efficient and stable electrocatalysts for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER) is crucial for green hydrogen production via the water&#8208;splitting system. The bifunctional electrocatalyst offers a promising strategy due to the simplified preparation process and reduced expenses. However, the single&#8208;component bifunctional catalysts often struggle to match the redox potential of water and to achieve proper adsorption/desorption of Gibbs free energy for both H and O intermediates simultaneously. Herein, through precisely controlling the topological transformation path of the RuNiOx precursor, we successfully prepared high&#8208;performance RuNi/Ni and Ru/NiO heterostructure electrocatalysts for the HER and OER, respectively. The energy level matching between the fabricated electrocatalyst and water oxidation/reduction potential confirms the feasibility of HER and OER. The synergistic effect between the active sites ensures rapid, intermediate adsorption/desorption kinetics. As a result, the assembled alkaline overall water splitting setup achieves a current density of 1 A cm&#8208;2 at 2 V and maintains stable operation at 100 mA cm&#8208;2 for 100 hours.</description>

      <title>Sulfate Oxyanion Steered &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Orbital Electronic State of Nickel&#8208;Iron Nanoalloy for Boosting Electrocatalytic Performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202408171</link>

                Abstract Oxyanion groups recently offer an innovative avenue for improving the sluggish kinetics of electrochemical reactions benefitting from their particular polyanion configurations and large electronegativity. Nevertheless, the exact structure design and deep regulating mechanism of oxyanion species remain poorly understood. Herein, a fresh architecture of the sulfate oxyanion coordinated nickel&#8208;iron nanoalloy on nitrogen and sulfur co&#8208;doped carbon nanotube (SO 4 2&#8722; &#8208;NiFe/NSCT) is newly proposed to study the activity increment effect and mechanism. The SO 4 2&#8722; &#8208;NiFe/NSCT displays hierarchical nanostructure with robust&#8208;wrinkled surface and highly efficient active sites. Importantly, the SO 4 2&#8722; group, as a significant manipulation factor, is first evidenced to promote the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity for NiFe nanoalloy under the reductive condition, showcasing outstanding bifunctional properties toward ORR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as well as the exceptional performance in non&#8208;aqueous Li&#8208;O 2 battery. Both experimental and theoretical results elucidate that, as an electron bridge, the introduction of SO 4 2&#8722; downshifts the d&#8208;band center of SO 4 2&#8722; &#8208;NiFe/NSCT and gives the electron transfer passageway between the H atom in OH* intermediate and the O atom in SO 4 2&#8722; group, greatly optimizing the metal&#8208;intermediate interaction with weaker bond energy. This work provides a deep insight into the activity enhancement mechanism by the sulfate oxyanion.</description>

                Comprehensive Summary Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have attracted significant attention due to their high atomic utilization and tunable coordination environment. However, the catalytic mechanisms related to the active center and coordination environment remain unclear. In this study, we systematically investigated the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalytic activities of NiN 4 , NiN 3 , NiN 3 H 2 , NiN 4 X, NiN 3 X, and NiN 3 H 2 X (X denotes axial ligand) through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This study unveils two distinct reaction pathways for ORR and OER, involving proton&#8208;electron pairs adsorbed from both the solution and the catalyst surface. The overpotential is the key parameter to evaluate the catalytic performance when proton&#8208;electron pairs are adsorbed from the solution. NiN 3 and NiN 3 H 2 show promise as pH&#8208;universal bifunctional electrocatalysts for both ORR and OER. On the other hand, when proton&#8208;electron pairs are adsorbed from the catalyst surface, the reaction energy barrier becomes the crucial metric for assessing catalytic activity. Our investigation reveals that NiN 3 H 2 consistently exhibits optimal ORR activity across a wide pH range, regardless of the source of proton&#8208;electron pair (solvent or catalyst surface).</description>

      <title>In Situ Raman Study of Layered Double Hydroxide Catalysts for Water Oxidation to Hydrogen Evolution: Recent Progress and Future Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/en17225712</link>

                With the increasing global emphasis on green energy and sustainable development goals, the electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is gradually becoming a crucial focus in research on water oxidation for hydrogen generation. However, its complicated reaction processes associated with its high energy barrier severely limit the efficiency of energy conversion. Recently, layered double hydroxide (LDH) has been considered as one of the most promising catalysts in alkaline media. Nonetheless, lacking a deep insight into the kinetic process of the electrocatalytic OER process is detrimental to the further optimization of LDH catalysts. Therefore, monitoring the catalytic reaction kinetic process via surface-sensitive in situ spectroscopy is especially important. In particular, the in situ Raman technique is capable of providing fingerprint information for surface species and intermediates in the operating environment. From the perspective of Raman spectroscopy, this paper provides an exhaustive overview of research progress in in situ Raman for the characterization of the catalytic mechanism of LDH catalysts, providing theoretical guidance for designing LDH materials. Finally, we present an incisive discussion on the challenges of the electrocatalytic in situ Raman technique and its future development trend.</description>

                Ruthenium metal and its oxide stand out for their exceptional catalytic activity, stability in Oxygen Evolution Reactions (OER) and electrical conductivity, making them indispensable in electronics and electrocatalysis. In this study, atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to synthesize ruthenium thin films, and the subsequent annealing of deposited ruthenium films at different elevated temperatures resulted in a progressive phase transformation from ruthenium metal to ruthenium dioxide (RuO2). The films were systematically characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy. XPS was carried out with both soft X-rays from a lab-based instrument and tender X-rays from the synchrotron. The different probing depths of the techniques revealed the gradual transformation of Ru to RuO2 from the top surface as the annealing temperature was increased. The water adsorption behavior of the films was also assessed using ambient pressure XPS (APXPS) at different water vapor pressures. The influence of annealing conditions on the films affinity for water and tendency for water dissociation was analyzed to seek an initial understanding of the surface chemistry relevant to electrochemical water splitting.</description>

                Abstract Kenneth (Ken) Sauer was a mainstay of research in photosynthesis at the University of California, Berkeley and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) for more than 50 years. Ken will be remembered by his colleagues, and other workers in the field of photosynthesis as well, for his pioneering work that introduced the physical techniques whose application have enriched our understanding of the basic reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis. His laboratory was a training ground for many students and postdocs who went on to success in the field of photosynthesis and many others. Trained as a physical chemist, he always brought that quantitative approach to research questions and used several spectroscopic methods in his research. His broad scientific interests concerned the role of manganese in oxygen evolution, electronic properties of chlorophylls, energy transport in antenna complexes, and electron transport reactions. He was also an enthusiastic teacher, an enormously successful mentor who leaves behind a legion of scientists as his abiding legacy, a lover of music and the outdoors with many interests beyond science, and a dedicated family man with a great sense of humility. In this tribute, we summarize some aspects of Ken Sauer&#8217;s life and career, illustrated with selected research achievements, and describe his approach to research and life as we perceived it, which is complemented by reminiscences of several current researchers in photosynthesis and other fields. The supporting material includes Ken Sauers&#8217;s CV and publication list, as well as a list of the graduate students and postdocs he trained and of researchers that spent a sabbatical in his lab.</description>

                This study explores the enhancement of &#945;-Fe2O3 (hematite) nanorod arrays for photoelec-trochemical applications by constructing a Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) heterojunction. While &#945;-Fe2O3 offers good stability, a low cost, and environmental benefits, its efficiency is limited by slow oxygen evolution kinetics, high carrier recombination rates, and low conductivity. By introducing CZTS, a material with strong light absorption and charge transport properties, we enhance the separation of photogenerated charge carriers, reduce charge transfer resistance, and increase the carrier concentration, thereby boosting the overall photoelectrochemical performance. The experimental results show that a modified FC-15 photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 3.40 mA/cm2 at 1.60 V vs. RHE, a substantial increase compared to 0.40 mA/cm2 for unmodified &#945;-Fe2O3. Band gap analysis reveals a reduced band gap in the FC-15 material, enhancing light absorption and boosting the photoelectrocatalytic performance. In photoelectrochemical water-splitting tests, the FC-15 photoanode achieves a hydrogen production rate of 41.6 &#956;mol/cm2/h, which is significantly improved over the unmodified sample at 5.64 &#956;mol/cm2/h. These findings indicate that the CZTS/&#945;-Fe2O3 heterojunction effectively promotes charge separation, enhances charge transport, and improves light absorption, substantially increasing photocatalytic efficiency. This heterojunction approach offers new insights and technical strategies for developing photocatalytic materials with potential applications in renewable energy.</description>

      <title>Atomistic understanding of hydrogen coverage on RuO2(110) surface under
  electrochemical conditions from ab initio statistical thermodynamics</title>

                Understanding the dehydrogenation of transition metal oxide surfaces under electrochemical potential is critical to the control of important chemical processes such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Using first principles computations, we model the thermodynamic dehydrogenation process on RuO$_2$(110) and compare the results to experimental cyclic voltammetry (CV) on single crystal. We use a cluster expansion model trained on *ab initio* energy data coupled with Monte Carlo (MC) sampling to derive the macroscopic electrochemical observables, i.e., experimental CV, from the energetics of different hydrogen coverage microstates on well-defined RuO$_2$(110). Our model reproduces the unique "two-peaks" cyclic voltammogram observed experimentally with current density peak positions and shapes in good qualitative agreement. We show that RuO$_2$(110) starts as a water-covered surface with hydrogen on bridge (BRG) and coordination-unsaturated sites (CUS) at low potential (less than 0.4 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE). As the potential increases, the hydrogens on BRG desorb, becoming the main contributor to the first CV peak with smaller contributions from CUS. When all BRG hydrogens are desorbed (before 1.2 V vs. RHE), the remaining CUS hydrogens desorb abruptly in a very small potential window leading to the sharp second peak observed during CV. Our work shows that above 1.23 V, the OER proceeds on a fully dehydrogenated RuO$_2$(110) surface.</description>

      <title>Controlled Synthesis of 2D Nanostructured Bimetallic Oxide (NiMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) on Self&#8208;Supported Nickel Foam for Boosted Electrocatalytic Seawater Oxidation Performance</title>

                The design and development of effective electrocatalysts containing nonprecious materials for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in seawater splitting remains a significant challenge for large&#8208;scale industrial hydrogen production. Nonprecious bimetallic oxide&#8208;constructed catalysts are utmost promising candidates to obtain boosting electrochemical water oxidation performance. Herein, a transition bimetallic oxide nanostructure electrocatalyst as NiMoO 4 vertically standing nanosheet over the nickel foam substrate (NiMoO 4 /NF) for electrochemical water oxidation process in alkaline fresh/simulated seawater conditions is presented. NiMoO 4 nanostructure on NF substrate is successfully obtained using a straightforward hydrothermal reaction route and thermal annealing processes. The surface morphology with elemental characteristics of the resultant NiMoO 4 /NF sample exposes highly homogenous vertical standing nanosheets assembled on the NF surface. The electrochemical water oxidation performance of the as&#8208;prepared electrodes demonstrates the function of diverse hydrothermal reaction times (3, 6, and 9 h) in fresh and simulated seawater electrolyte conditions. In alkaline seawater electrolyte conditions, optimal hydrothermal reaction time&#8208;assisted NiMoO 4 /NF&#8208;6 h electrocatalyst possesses significant OER electrocatalytic actives compared to the other samples. Similarly, NiMoO 4 /NF&#8208;6 h catalyst exhibits a small overpotential of 429 mV to achieve a current density of 50 mA cm &#8722;2 with a Tafel slope value of 122 mV dec &#8722;1 for OER process. As a result, the resultant superior electrocatalytic performance of the optimal hydrothermal reaction time&#8208;aided electrocatalyst (NiMoO 4 /NF&#8208;6 h) is ascribed to highly accessible catalytic active centers and enhanced charge transfer kinetics at the interface for electrochemical reactions. Thus, proposed nanostructure&#8208;constructed electrocatalysts could prove to be prospective OER candidates for electrochemical water oxidation.</description>

      <title>On the Non-Oxygenic Origins of Thylakoids</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2411.07081</link>
      <description>Luc Cornet, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404391957

                Recent studies have shed light on the emergence and evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis. It is likely that the ancestor of Terrabacteria already possessed two distinct reaction centers, and that the ability to split water via photosystem II arose early in their evolution. Consequently, it is equally probable that the emergence of thylakoid membranes played a crucial role in the accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. However, the study of thylakoid emergence remains less explored than the origin of photosystems. With a highly synchronized process involving numerous assembly factors, the biogenesis of thylakoid membranes suggests the existence of intermediate evolutionary states in the emergence of these compartments. Constrained by the sulfide-rich environment of the Archean, I propose a non-oxygenic origin of thylakoid membranes, which would have been initially devoted to alternative electron flows.</description>

                Dual&#8208;atom catalysts with nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal sites embedded in carbon can drive the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) in rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs), and the further improvement is limited by the linear scaling relationship of intermediate binding energies in the absorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Triggering the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM) is promising to overcome this challenge, but has yet been verified since the lacking of bridge oxygen (O) in the rigid coordination environment of the metal centers. Here, we demonstrate that suitably tailored dual&#8208;atom catalysts of FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C can undergo out&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane reconstruction to form the both axial O and bridge O at the metal centers, and thus activate the LOM pathway. The tailored FeCo&#8211;N&#8211;C with shortened Fe&#8211;N bonds also favor the ORR process, therefore is a promising dual&#8208;atom oxygen catalyst. The assembled rechargeable ZABs demonstrate a peak power density of 332 mW cm&#8722;2, and exhibit no notable decline after ~ 720 h of continuous cycling.</description>

                LOCALIZED CORROSION OF ALUMINUM IN AERATED ENVIRONMENTS AND IN ENVIRONMENTS WITH LOW OXYGEN CONTENT: STUDY AND COMPARISON THROUGH POLARIZATION CURVES. In this study, the influence of deaeration on the electrochemical behavior of aluminum was studied by polarization techniques. The advantages of deaeration for the evaluation of localized corrosion on aluminum are discussed. The influence of the corrosive environment with low oxygen contents on the electrochemical response of aluminum was evaluated by anodic and cathodic potentiodynamic polarization curves. The polarization tests were carried out in chloride solutions followed by optical and scanning electron microscopy characterization. It was observed that deaeration of the solution significantly influences the electrochemical behavior of aluminum, as predicted by corrosion kinetics theories. For the cathodic curves, a decrease in the limiting current density for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was observed for low oxygen solutions, while the &#8220;apparent&#8221; initiation of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) was shifted to higher potentials. In the anodic curves, a common passive behavior was not observed in aerated conditions, however, at the corrosion potential, localized pitting was observed indicating that the material was already above the breakdown potential (Ebr). In the low oxygen content solution, however, a passive region with a breakdown potential, was observed on the anodic curves.</description>

                Abstract Mitochondria, as the cellular end-users of oxygen and responsible for approximately 98% of total body oxygen consumption, play a significant role in the development of organ dysfunction during shock. Therefore, integrating information on mitochondrial oxygen homeostasis with macroscopic observations of macrocirculation and microcirculation is crucial for monitoring critically ill patients or those undergoing high-risk surgery. However, current clinical practice still lack reliable surrogate parameters for assessing mitochondrial function. The Cellular Oxygen METabolism (COMET) monitor, utilizing the protoporphyrin IX triplet state lifetime technique (PpIX-TSLT), represents the first clinical device capable of non-invasive, in vivo measurement of mitochondrial oxygen pressure and oxidative phosphorylation. Recent research suggests that implementing this real-time bedside monitoring will provide additional insights into microcirculatory dynamics and enhance patient management. This review will comprehensively detail the rationale, methodologies, evolution, and clinical applications of the technique, aiming at improving the understanding of mitochondrial pathology in daily clinical practice and facilitating the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.

      <title>From Micro-Environments to Macroscopic Effects: How the Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Drives Cu Cathodic Corrosion</title>

                Cathodic corrosion of copper (Cu) has posed a significant challenge for over a century, impeding various technological progresses such as electrochemical conversion of CO2 (eCO2RR) into fuels and other value-added carbon products. In this study, employing a combined Density Functional Theory (DFT) and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation approach, we delve into the atomistic level mechanism driving this phenomenon in Cu. Our hypothesis posits the pivotal role of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in facilitating cathodic corrosion in Cu. We rigorously develop a pH-dependent hydroxide (OH) adsorption mechanism and calculate the equilibrium OH coverage (&#120579;OH) at varying pH levels, the thermodynamic stability of subsurface oxygen (Osub), as well as the Cu-vacancy mediated diffusion of subsurface oxygens (Osub). Through comprehensive analysis, we establish correlation among various microenvironments, including oxygen diffusion in subsurface layers, pH-dependent OH adsorption, and Cu dissolution into the electrolyte as (Cu- OH) complexes. Furthermore, our investigation explores the correlation between surface coordination environment of active sites and cathodic corrosion of Cu. Finally, by integrating DFT- derived thermodynamic data into a kMC model, we successfully predict the formation of experimentally observed corrosion pits on Cu-surfaces. This combined approach not only advances our fundamental understanding of Cu cathodic corrosion but also offers insights crucial for developing effective corrosion mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Analysis of pore formation and carburizing mechanism of magnetite reduction by CO</title>

                To investigate the porosity and expansion mechanism of CO-reduced magnetite, the reduced microstructures of magnetite under conventional heating and microwave heating were compared. The microstructure characteristics of magnetite with various reduction degrees were examined in a 60%CO-Ar reduction atmosphere, and the formation and evolution mechanism of the structure were analyzed in conjunction with the reduction effect. The results indicate that the reduction product of CO reduced magnetite possesses a porous structure. Nevertheless, when the gas diffusion is restricted, the reduction process is sluggish and the porous structure is not readily formed. Microwave heating enhances the gas-phase diffusion capacity, thermodynamic carburizing capacity, and solid-phase carbon-oxygen diffusion capacity, resulting in a higher oxygen loss rate than that of conventional heating. Under the experimental conditions, the lattice shrinkage during the Fe 3 O 4 &#8594; Fe 0.88 O transformation and the rapid expansion of Fe 0.88 O &#8594; Fe 0.94 O are the causes of the crack. Microwaves facilitate the formation of pores and cracks in the product. This study offers a novel concept for the development of foam steel.</description>

                The disproportionate expansion of telencephalic structures during human evolution involved tradeoffs that imposed greater connectivity and metabolic demands on midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Despite the central role of dopaminergic neurons in human-enriched disorders, molecular specializations associated with human-specific features and vulnerabilities of the dopaminergic system remain unexplored. Here, we establish a phylogeny-in-a-dish approach to examine gene regulatory evolution by differentiating pools of human, chimpanzee, orangutan, and macaque pluripotent stem cells into ventral midbrain organoids capable of forming long-range projections, spontaneous activity, and dopamine release. We identify human-specific gene expression changes related to axonal transport of mitochondria and reactive oxygen species buffering and candidate cis- and trans-regulatory mechanisms underlying gene expression divergence. Our findings are consistent with a model of evolved neuroprotection in response to tradeoffs related to brain expansion and could contribute to the discovery of therapeutic targets and strategies for treating disorders involving the dopaminergic system.</description>

                Abstract Lutao is an islet off the eastern coast of the main island of Taiwan and is composed of pyroclastic agglomerates, volcanic breccias, lava flows, and dykes. There have been no reports of SIMS zircon oxygen isotopic data from Lutao Island so far, which has significantly hampered further understanding of its magmatic processes, such as crystallization, evolution, and generation of magma. In this study, we use zircon U&#8211;Pb dating, Lu&#8211;Hf and O isotopic analysis to constrain the age, origin, and magmatic processes of the volcanic rocks from Lutao Island. Integration of our new U&#8211;Pb and Hf&#8211;O isotope data with available published data allows us to better assess the timing and magmatic processes of Lutao Island in the context of the northern Luzon arc system. This work is the first report of SIMS zircon oxygen isotopic data of volcanic rocks from Lutao island. This study shows that the volcanic rocks from Lutao Island were generated by mantle-derived magma associated with high-T&#176; hydrothermal alteration by seawater-derived fluids.</description>

      <title>A phenotype-structured mathematical model for the influence of hypoxia
  on oncolytic virotherapy</title>

                The effectiveness of oncolytic virotherapy is significantly affected by several elements of the tumour microenvironment, which reduce the ability of the virus to infect cancer cells. In this work, we focus on the influence of hypoxia on this therapy and develop a novel continuous mathematical model that considers both the spatial and epigenetic heterogeneity of the tumour. We investigate how oxygen gradients within tumours affect the spatial distribution and replication of both the tumour and oncolytic viruses, focusing on regions of severe hypoxia versus normoxic areas. Additionally, we analyse the evolutionary dynamics of tumour cells under hypoxic conditions and their influence on susceptibility to viral infection. Our findings show that the reduced metabolic activity of hypoxic cells may significantly impact the virotherapy effectiveness; the knowledge of the tumour's oxygenation could, therefore, suggest the most suitable type of virus to optimise the outcome. The combination of numerical simulations and theoretical results for the model equilibrium values allows us to elucidate the complex interplay between viruses, tumour evolution and oxygen dynamics, ultimately contributing to developing more effective and personalised cancer treatments.</description>

      <title>Research on aging mechanism and capacity attenuation of automotive lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1177/09544070241293593</link>

                In order to investigate the internal mechanism and the variation law of capacity attenuation of LIBs, a simplified electrochemical model of the LIBs was established using the nickel-cobalt-aluminum LIBs as the research object, and the aging model of solid electrolyte interface SEI growth and lithium evolution was added to simulate the electrochemical behavior of the batteries. The results showed that the porosity of the anode/diaphragm reduced continually at the start of the cycle, while the SEI film grew continuously. The loss of active materials accelerated as the number of cycles increased, while the side reaction of lithium development continued. Finally, the aging mechanism was confirmed by using microscopic morphology. The results show that the negative particles are obviously crushed and contain white deposited substances. The formation of these compounds increases the oxygen content, reduces the carbon content, reduces the porosity of the electrode, increases the overpotential of the electrolyte transport, and becomes the main reason for the attenuation of the battery life. Finally, the positive particles expand and break, which leads to the sudden reduction of the battery capacity. This study determined the evolution process of aging mechanism in the whole life cycle, and provided a theoretical basis for the establishment of mechanism aging model.</description>

                The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) of nickelates has potential similarities with cuprate superconductors, which may provide unique perspectives on the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. Up to now, most of high-pressure experiments concentrated on the lanthanum-related RP phase. Therefore, the discovery of new superconducting nickelate compounds is highly desired to explore the generality of pressure-induced superconductivity in RP nickelates. Here, we grow high-quality Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal with an optical floating zone furnace under high oxygen pressure and conduct high-pressure transport measurements with various pressure transmitting mediums. The density wave in Pr4Ni3O10 single crystal was suppressed by pressure, accompanying the arising of superconducting state beyond 10 GPa. The maximum and unsaturated Tc of 39 K is obtained within our research pressure. Although zero resistivity was not achieved in our experiments, the pressure and temperature-dependent diamagnetism along with the systematic evolution of resistivity with applied magnetic field, corroborate the superconductivity in Pr4Ni3O10 single crystals. Our findings provide a new platform for the investigation of the relationship among structural evolution, magnetism, correlation, and superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates.</description>

      <title>Introduction of cytosine-5 DNA methylation sensitizes cells to oxidative damage</title>

                DNA methylation at the 5 position of cytosine (5mC) is an ancient epigenetic mark in eukaryotes. The levels of total 5mC vary enormously between different species, and the DNA methyltransferases that introduce 5mC have been repeatedly lost in several independent lineages. DNA methyltransferases are a threat to genomic stability due to the increased mutagenicity of 5mC bases and the propensity of DNA methyltransferases themselves to introduce DNA alkylation damage as an off-target effect. However, whether alkylation damage explains why 5mC is frequently lost in evolution is unclear. Here we tested the fitness consequences of DNA methyltransferase-induced alkylation damage by introducing a eukaryotic-like 5mC system into E. coli . We showed that introducing 5mC genome-wide leads to increased sensitivity to alkylating agents, which is strongly enhanced by removal of the 3mC repair enzyme AlkB. Unexpectedly, we discovered that 5mC introduction led to increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. We showed that this is due to increased formation of reactive oxygen in the presence of 5mC. We determined that reactive oxygen species led to non-enzymatic oxidation of 5mC, producing modified cytosines such as 5fC that are recognised as DNA base damage in E. coli . Overall, our work identifies increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, as well as alkylating agents, as a negative consequence of genome-wide 5mC. Oxidative stress is frequently encountered by organisms in their environment, thus offering a plausible reason for total loss of 5mC in some species.</description>

      <title>Rational design of MoS2/CNT heterostructure with rich S-vacancy for enhanced HER performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0237254</link>
      <description>Yuxin Sun, Jinhua Li, Zhiying Wang, Fengxue Tan, Kaixi Shi, Yingjiao Zhai, The Journal of Chemical Physics. 161(18)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404244572

                Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is a promising electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) due to excellent stability and low cost. However, the utilization in electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution is constrained by inherent shortcomings, including fewer edge active sites, poor dispersion, and electrical conductivity. In this work, MoS2 was compounded with carbon nanotubes (CNTs), which are known for their high specific surface area and excellent electrical conductivity. These CNTs, laden with oxygen-containing functional groups, provided nucleation sites that facilitated the rapid assembly of MoS2 nanoflowers under hydrothermal conditions within 3 h. Due to their diminutive size (&#8764;300 nm), these nanoflowers possess a large specific surface area and numerous active sites at their edges. Furthermore, MoS2 nanoflowers exhibited a high concentration of intrinsic S-vacancies. This heterojunction material exhibited superior HER properties. In addition, density functional theory simulation further confirmed that the MoS2 with S vacancy and CNT heterojunction electrocatalysts (VS-M/C) provided a fast charge transfer pathway for water electrolysis, and analysis showed that the conduction band minimum and valence band maximum were mainly contributed by the d orbits of Mo and the p orbits of C. This study proffered a novel approach for the engineering of high-performance MoS2-based HER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Chemical Evolution of R-process Elements in Stars (CERES) II. The impact
  of stellar evolution and rotation on light and heavy elements</title>

                Context. Carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen are the most abundant elements throughout the universe, after hydrogen and helium. Studying these elements in low-metallicity stars can provide crucial information on the chemical composition in the early Galaxy and possible internal mixing processes that can alter the surface composition of the stars. Aims. This work aims to investigate the chemical abundance patterns for CNO elements and Li in a homogeneously analyzed sample of 52 metal-poor halo giant stars. Methods. We used high-resolution spectra with a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) to carry out a spectral synthesis to derive detailed C, N, O, and Li abundances for a sample of stars with metallicities in the range of -3.58 &lt;= [Fe/H] &lt;= -1.79 dex. Our study was based on the assumption of one-dimensional (1D) local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) atmospheres. Results. Based on carbon and nitrogen abundances, we investigated the deep mixing taking place within stars along the red giant branch (RGB). The individual abundances of carbon decrease towards the upper RGB while nitrogen shows an increasing trend, indicating that carbon has been converted into nitrogen. No signatures of ON-cycle processed material were found for the stars in our sample. We computed a set of galactic chemical evolution (GCE) models, implementing different sets of massive star yields, both with and without including the effects of stellar rotation on nucleosynthesis. We confirm that stellar rotation is necessary to explain the highest [N/Fe] and [N/O] ratios observed in unmixed halo stars. The predicted level of N enhancement varies sensibly in dependence of the specific set of yields that are adopted. For stars with stellar parameters similar to those of our sample, heavy elements such as Sr, Y, and Zr appear to have unchanged abundances despite the stellar evolution mixing processes.</description>

      <title>Personalized &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; model for radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2024.0525</link>

                Radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (RIPF) is a severe late-stage complication of radiotherapy (RT) to the chest area, typically used in lung cancer treatment. This condition is characterized by the gradual and irreversible replacement of healthy lung tissue with fibrous scar tissue, leading to decreased lung function, reduced oxygen exchange and critical respiratory deficiencies. Currently, predicting and managing lung fibrosis post-RT remains challenging, with limited preventive and treatment options. Accurate prediction of fibrosis onset and progression is therefore clinically crucial. We present a personalized in silico model for pulmonary fibrosis that encompasses tumour regression, fibrosis development and lung tissue remodelling post-radiation. Our continuum-based model was developed using data from 12 RT-treated lung cancer patients and integrates computed tomography (CT) and dosimetry data to simulate the spatio-temporal evolution of fibrosis. We demonstrate the ability of the in silico model to capture the extent of fibrosis in the entire cohort with a less than 1% deviation from clinical observations, in addition to providing quantitative metrics of spatial similarity. These findings underscore the potential of the model to improve treatment planning and risk assessment, paving the way for more personalized and effective management of RIPF.</description>

      <title>Supersensitive seismic magnetometry on white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2410.20557</link>
      <description>Nicholas Z. Rui, Jim Fuller, J. J. Hermes, arXiv (Cornell University). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404314173

                The origin of magnetic fields in white dwarfs (WDs) remains mysterious. Magnetic WDs are traditionally associated with field strengths $\gtrsim1\,\mathrm{MG}$, set by the sensitivity of typical spectroscopic magnetic field measurements. Informed by recent developments in red giant magnetoasteroseismology, we revisit the use of WD pulsations as a seismic magnetometer. WD pulsations primarily probe near-surface magnetic fields, whose effect on oscillation mode frequencies is to asymmetrize rotational multiplets and, if strong enough, suppress gravity-mode propagation altogether. The sensitivity of seismology to magnetic fields increases strongly with mode period and decreases quickly with the depth of the partial ionization-driven surface convective zone. We place upper limits for magnetic fields in $24$ pulsating WDs: $20$ hydrogen-atmosphere (DAV) and three helium-atmosphere (DBV) carbon-oxygen WDs, and one extremely low-mass (helium-core) pulsator. These bounds are typically $\sim1$-$10\,\mathrm{kG}$, although they can reach down to $\sim10$-$100\,\mathrm{G}$ for DAVs and helium-core WDs in which lower-frequency modes are excited. Seismic magnetometry may enable new insights into the formation and evolution of WD magnetism.</description>

                Background Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a common pathway to End-stage renal disease (ESRD). Podocytes are crucial due to their dual barrier functions in kidney diseases. Their role in renal fibrosis and DKD regulatory mechanisms is increasingly studied. However, bibliometric research in this field has not been explored. Methods 1,250 publications from Jan. 1, 2000, to Feb. 16, 2024, were retrieved from the WoSCC database and analyzed by the Web of Science results analysis tool, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace. Results Our scrutiny reveals that authors Liu Youhua, Fogo Agnes B, and Zhao Yingyong have made substantial contributions to this domain. Notably, &#8220;Kidney International&#8221; has the highest volume of publications in this area. Furthermore, our analysis identifies ten co-citation clusters: DKD, IncRNA, reactive oxygen species, glomerulosclerosis, Poria cocos, glomerular diseases, fibroblasts, connective tissue growth factor, coagulation, and Wnt. Recent research accentuates keywords such as autophagy, TRPC6, ERS, epigenetics, and NLRP3 inflammasome as frequently occurring terms in this field. The prevailing research hotspot keywords include autophagy, biomarker, and exosomes. Conclusion Through the utilization of bibliometric tools and knowledge graph analysis, we have undertaken a comprehensive review of the intricate nexus between podocytes in DKD and renal fibrosis. This study imparts valuable insights to scholars regarding the dynamic evolution of this association and delineates prospective research avenues in this pivotal realm.</description>

      <title>Versatile Organometallic Synthesis of 0D/2D Metal@Germanane Nanoarchitectonics for Electrochemical Energy Conversion Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smtd.202400854</link>

                Abstract Hydrogen&#8208;terminated 2D&#8211;Germanane (2D&#8211;GeH), a germanium&#8208;based 2D material akin to graphene, is receiving enormous attention owing to its predicted optoelectronic characteristics. However, experimental research of 2D&#8211;GeH is still in an early stage, and therefore its real implementation for task&#8208;specific applications will depend on the correct development of suitable chemical functionalization methods. Herein, a general and straightforward organometallic (OM) approach is provided for the robust functionalization of 2D&#8211;GeH with different 0D noble metal nanoparticles (M&#8211;NPs), resulting in 0D/2D M@GeH nanoarchitectonics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, 0D/2D Pt@GeH and Au@GeH nanoarchitectonics have been successfully synthesized, characterized, and explored as unconventional electrocatalysts for boosting energy conversion reactions. While the hydrogen evolution reaction activity was evaluated for Pt@GeH, the oxygen reduction reaction was interrogated for Au@GeH. Interestingly, the implanted catalytic features of M&#8211;NPs yielded to 0D/2D M@GeH nanoarchitectonics with enhanced energy conversion activity comparing to pristine 2D&#8211;GeH counterpart. This work proves the suitability of 2D&#8211;GeH as unconventional substrates to stabilize nobleM&#8722;NPs, and the versatility of the OM approach for the custom design of a new family of 0D/2D M@GeH nanoarchitectonics to expand the implementation of monoelemental 2D materials as promising electrocatalysts in energy conversion field and beyond.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the marine iodine cycle and its relationship to ocean deoxygenation in an Earth system model</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-21-4927-2024</link>
      <description>Keyi Cheng, Andy Ridgwell, Dalton Hardisty, Biogeosciences. 21(21)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404326688

                Abstract. Iodine (I) abundance in marine carbonates (measured as an elemental ratio with calcium, I / Ca) is of broad interest as a proxy for local/regional ocean redox. This connection arises because the speciation of iodine in seawater, the balance between iodate (IO3-) and iodide (I&#8722;), is sensitive to the prevalence of oxic vs. anoxic conditions. However, although I / Ca ratios are increasingly commonly being measured in ancient carbonate samples, a fully quantitative interpretation of this proxy requires the availability of a mechanistic interpretative framework for the marine iodine cycle that can account for the extent and intensity of ocean deoxygenation in the past. Here we present and evaluate a representation of marine iodine cycling embedded in an Earth system model (&#8220;cGENIE&#8221;) against both modern and paleo-observations. In this framework, we account for IO3- uptake and release of I&#8722; through the biological pump, the reduction in ambient IO3- to I&#8722; in the water column, and the re-oxidation of I&#8722; to IO3-. We develop and test a variety of different plausible mechanisms for iodine reduction and oxidation transformation and contrast model projections against an updated compilation of observed dissolved IO3- and I&#8722; concentrations in the present-day ocean. By optimizing the parameters controlling previously proposed mechanisms involved in marine iodine cycling, we find that we can obtain broad matches to observed iodine speciation gradients in zonal surface distribution, depth profiles, and oxygen-deficient zones (ODZs). However, we also identify alternative, equally well performing mechanisms which assume a more explicit mechanistic link between iodine transformation and environment &#8211; an ambiguity that highlights the need for more process-based studies on modern marine iodine cycling. Finally, to help distinguish between competing representations of the marine iodine cycle and because our ultimate motivation is to further our ability to reconstruct ocean oxygenation in the geological past, we conducted &#8220;plausibility tests&#8221; of different model schemes against available I / Ca measurements made on Cretaceous carbonates &#8211; a time of substantially depleted ocean oxygen availability compared to modern and hence a strong test of our model. Overall, the simultaneous broad match we can achieve between modeled iodine speciation and modern observations, and between forward proxy modeled I / Ca and geological elemental ratios, supports the application of our Earth system modeling in simulating the marine iodine cycle to help interpret and constrain the redox evolution of past oceans.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Magma Plumbing System and Regional Magmatic Processes via Chemical and Structural Zoning of Biotite in Rhyolite from Long Valley, CA</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2024jb029205</link>
      <description>Jiaxin Xi, Yiping Yang, Huifang Xu, Haiyang Xian, Fabin Pan, Shan Li, Shuo Xue, Yonghua Cao, Jianxi Zhu, Hongping He, Journal of Geophysical Research Solid Earth. 129(9)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404291502

                Abstract Minerals with compositional zoning in volcanic products are widely used to decipher the history of magmatic evolution. However, structural information, which reflects physical conditions and crystallization equilibrium, has often been overlooked. This study presents the first report on the structural zoning of deep&#8208;derived biotite phenocrysts through investigations of metaluminous rhyolite from Long Valley, CA. Biotite is enriched in Si, Mg, and K and depleted in Fe 3+ , Ti, and Al IV in core zones compared with rims. In situ structural analyses, including micro X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, were conducted to identify cores with perfect 2 M 1 polytype and disordered rims of biotite. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in revealing various (micro)polytypes of a single species, which occur at different crystallization temperatures, pressures, supersaturation levels, and oxygen fugacities. The concept of structural zoning is introduced here to describe the different structural features distributed systematically in various parts of minerals. By combining structural and chemical zoning, we illustrate a two&#8208;step growth for samples: equilibrium crystallization of the highly ordered cores in a deep magma reservoir with high temperature and pressure, followed by rapid growth of disordered rims during magma mixing in a crystal mush. We further discuss the implications of these findings for reflecting the plumbing system structure and eruption history of rhyolitic magma over extended periods. Our study underscores the remarkable sensitivity of structural zoning in delineating the crystallization conditions of minerals and documenting the environmental changes within magma.</description>

                We present an investigation of Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in the spatially resolved Keplerian disk around V883 Ori, an eruptive young star, based on a spectral survey carried out with ALMA in Band 6 (220.7$-$274.9 GHz). We identified about 3,700 molecular emission lines and discovered 23 COMs in the disk. We estimated the column densities of COMs detected through the iterative LTE line fitting method. According to our analyses, using only optically thin lines is critical to deriving the reliable column densities of COMs. Therefore, covering a large frequency range is important for the studies of COMs. The most distinct phenomenon found from the spectra of the V883 Ori disk is that nitrogen-bearing COMs other than CH$_{3}$CN are missing, whereas various oxygen-bearing COMs, except for the CH$_2$OH-bearing molecules, are detected. The missing CH$_2$OH-bearing COMs may indicate the warm water-ice dominant environment for forming COMs. We compared our results with various objects in different evolutionary stages, from Class 0 hot corinos to a Solar System comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to examine the effect of evolution on the COM compositions. In general, the COMs abundances relative to methanol in V883 Ori are higher than in the hot corinos and hot cores, while they are comparable to the cometary values. This may indicate the planet-forming material chemically evolves in the disk midplane after being accreted from the envelope. In addition, as found in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, nitrogen might also be trapped as ammonium salt within the dust grains in the V883 Ori disk.</description>

      <title>Occurrence of Gravitational Collapse in the Accreting Neutron Stars of Binary-driven Hypernovae</title>

                Abstract The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model proposes long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate in binaries composed of a carbon&#8211;oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion. The CO core collapse generates a newborn NS and a supernova that triggers the GRB by accreting onto the NSs, rapidly transferring mass and angular momentum to them. This article aims to determine the conditions under which a black hole (BH) forms from NS collapse induced by the accretion and the impact on the GRB&#8217;s observational properties and taxonomy. We perform three-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of BdHNe using up-to-date NS nuclear equations of state, with and without hyperons, and calculate the structure evolution in full general relativity. We assess the binary parameters leading either NS in the binary to the critical mass for gravitational collapse into a BH and its occurrence time, t col . We include a nonzero angular momentum of the NSs and find that t col ranges from a few tens of seconds to hours for decreasing NS initial angular momentum values. BdHNe I are the most compact (about 5 minute orbital period), promptly form a BH, and release &#8819;10 52 erg of energy. They form NS&#8211;BH binaries with tens of kiloyears merger timescales by gravitational-wave emission. BdHNe II and III do not form BHs, and release &#8764;10 50 &#8211;10 52 erg and &#8818;10 50 erg of energy, respectively. They form NS&#8211;NS binaries with a range of merger timescales larger than for NS&#8211;BH binaries. In some compact BdHNe II, either NS can become supramassive, i.e., above the critical mass of a nonrotating NS. Magnetic braking by a 10 13 G field can delay BH formation, leading to BH&#8211;BH or NS&#8211;BH with tens of kiloyears merger timescales.</description>

      <title>Spatio-chemical deconvolution of the LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2/Li6PS5Cl interphase layer in all-solid-state batteries using combined X-ray spectroscopic methods</title>

                The (electro-)chemical degradation at the interface between Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) and LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) is systematically investigated using non-destructive synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (XPEEM). These techniques provide surface chemical depth profiling (from 2 nm to several hundred nm) and high-resolution elemental imaging of both LPSC and NCM622 particles. This analysis was complemented by galvanostatic cycling, impedance spectroscopy, and operando cell pressure measurements. Several correlations between interphase evolution and cell electrochemical performance are clarified, while some inconsistencies are rationalized and discussed. Firstly, the intrinsic LPSC electrochemical oxidation mechanisms were studied using an LPSC:C65 working electrode. The results showed that increased cell resistance during the first charge stemmed from polysulfide by-products and particle contact loss due to LPSC volume shrinkage at the interface. Secondly, when using an NCM622:LPSC working electrode, species such as sulfites, sulfates and phosphates, were detected on both LPSC and NCM622 particles, while electrochemically inactive reduced transition metals (TMs) were observed only at NCM622 surfaces. These species, initially present at open circuit potential, increased after the first charge, due to the chemical reactions between LPSC and NCM622 surface lattice oxygen. The estimated interphase thickness on the LPSC and NCM622 surface over the cycling remains below &#8275;3 nm. Our findings highlight that the formation of an electrochemically inactive NCM622 surface is a primary cause of impedance rise during the first charge, along with the formation of LPSC by-products and contact loss. However, the continuous increase in cell resistance could not be attributed to further interphase growth after the first charge. We hypothesize that this may result from slow and progressive LPSC polymerization reactions (e.g., form Li2PS6 and P2S5) and structural changes at the NCM622 surface.</description>

      <title>Sulfur-bearing molecules in a sample of early star-forming cores</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2411.00539</link>

                The sulfur content in dense molecular regions of the interstellar medium is highly depleted in comparison to diffuse clouds. The reason of this phenomenon is unclear, thus it is necessary to carry out observational studies of sulfur-bearing species towards dense regions, mainly at early evolutive stages to uncover the early sulfur chemistry. Using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) data archive, we investigated a sample of 37 dense cores embedded in the most massive infrared-quiet molecular clumps from the ATLASGAL survey. Lines of 34SO, SO2, NS, SO, SO+, and H2CS were analyzed and column densities of each molecular species were obtained. From the continuum emission, and two CH3OH lines, the 37 cores were characterized in density and temperature, and the corresponding H2 column densities were derived. The abundances of such sulfur-bearing species were derived and studied. We find that the abundances of the analyzed species increase with the growth of the gas temperature, suggesting that the chemistry involved in the formation of each of the analyzed molecule may have a similar dependence with Tk in the range 20 to 100 K. We find that the comparisons among abundances are, in general, highly correlated. Given that such correlation decreases in more evolved sources, we suggest that the sulfur-bearing species here analyzed should have a similar chemical origin. From the measured line widths we point out that molecules with oxygen content (34SO, SO2, SO, and SO+) may be associated with warmer and more turbulent gas than the other ones. H2CS and NS are associated with more quiescent gas, probably in the external envelopes of the cores. This work gives quantitative information about abundances that could be useful in chemical models pointing to explain the sulfur chemistry in the interstellar medium.</description>

                Abstract We present NIRSpec/MSA observations from the JWST large-area survey WIDE, targeting the rest-frame UV&#8211;optical spectrum of Ulema, a radio-AGN host at redshift z = 4.6348. The low-resolution prism spectrum displays high equivalent width nebular emission, with remarkably high ratios of low-ionisation species of oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, relative to hydrogen; auroral O+ emission is clearly detected, possibly also C+. From the high-resolution grating spectrum, we measure a gas velocity dispersion of &#963; &#8764; 400 km s&#8722;1, broad enough to rule out star-forming gas in equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the galaxy. Diagnostics based on emission-line ratios suggest that the nebular emission is due to a shock which ran out of pre-shock gas. To infer the physical properties of the system, we model simultaneously the galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) and shock-driven line emission under a Bayesian framework. We find a relatively low-mass, star-forming system (M&#8902; = 1.4 &#215; 1010 M&#8857;, SFR = 70 M&#8857; yr&#8722;1), where shock-driven emission contributes 50 per cent to the total H&#946; luminosity. The nebular metallicity is near solar &#8211; three times higher than that predicted by the mass-metallicity relation at z = 4.6, possibly related to fast-paced chemical evolution near the galaxy nucleus. We find no evidence for a recent decline in the SFR of the galaxy, meaning that, already at this early epoch, fast radio-mode AGN feedback was poorly coupled with the bulk of the star-forming gas; therefore, most of the feedback energy must end up in the galaxy halo, setting the stage for future quenching.</description>

                The evolution of protoplanetary disks in regions with massive OB stars is influenced by externally driven winds that deplete the outer parts of these disks. The winds have previously been studied via forbidden oxygen emission lines, which also arise in isolated disks in low-mass star-forming regions (SFRs) with weak external UV fields in photoevaporative or magnetic (internal) disk winds. It is crucial to determine how to disentangle external winds from internal ones. Here, we report a proxy for unambiguously identifying externally driven winds with a forbidden line of neutral atomic carbon We compare for the first time the spatial location of the emission in the and lines traced by VLT/MUSE-NFM with the ALMA Band 7 continuum disk emission in a sample of 12 proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We confirm that the emission is co-spatial with the disk emission, whereas that of is emitted both on the disk surface and on the ionization front of the proplyds. We show for the first time that the line is also co-spatial with the disk surface in proplyds, as seen in the MUSE and ALMA data comparison. The peak emission is compatible with the stellar location in all cases, apart from one target with high relative inclination with respect to the ionizing radiation, where the peak emission is located at the disk edge in the direction of the ionizing radiation. To verify whether the line is detected in regions where external photoevaporation is not expected, we examined VLT/X-Shooter spectra for young stars in low-mass SFRs. Although the and 6300 lines are well detected in all these targets, the total detection rate is $ in the case of the line. This number increases substantially to a $ detection rate in sigma -Orionis, a region with higher UV radiation than in low-mass SFRs, but lower than in the ONC. The spatial location of the line emission and the lack of its detection in isolated disks in low-mass SFRs strongly suggest that this line is a tell-tale tracer of externally driven photoevaporative winds, which agrees with recent excitation models.</description>

The spatial location of the [C i] 8727 A line emission and the lack of its detection in isolated disks in low-mass SFRs strongly suggest that this line is a tell-tale tracer of externally driven photoevaporative winds, which agrees with recent excitation models.</description>

      <title>UV-Induced DNA Repair Mechanisms and Their Effects on Mutagenesis and Culturability in Escherichia coli</title>

                Mutagenic processes drive evolutionary progress, with ultraviolet (UV) radiation significantly affecting evolution. Despite extensive research on SOS response-mediated mutagenesis, UV-induced repair mechanisms remain complex, and their effects on cell survival and mutagenesis are not fully understood. We previously observed a near-perfect correlation between RecA-mediated SOS response and mutation levels in Escherichia coli following UV treatment. However, prolonged UV exposure caused transient non-culturability and impaired SOS-mediated mutagenesis. Using fluorescent reporters, flow cytometry, promoter-reporter assays, single-gene deletions, knockouts, and clonogenic assays, we found that excessive UV exposure disrupts cellular translation, reducing SOS gene expression, albeit with minimal impact on membrane permeability or reactive oxygen species levels. While our findings underline the abundance of repair mechanisms in E. coli cells, enabling them to compensate when specific genes are disrupted, they also highlighted the differential impacts of gene deletions on mutagenesis versus culturability, leading to three major outcomes: (i) Disruption of proteins involved in DNA polymerase for trans-lesion synthesis (UmuC and UmuD) or Holliday junction resolution (RuvC) results in significantly decreased mutagenesis levels while maintaining a transient non-culturability pattern after UV exposure. (ii) Disruption of proteins involved in homologous recombination (RecA and RecB) and nucleotide excision repair (UvrA) leads to both significantly reduced mutagenesis and a more severe transient non-culturability pattern after UV exposure, making these cells more sensitive to UV. (iii) Disruption of DNA Helicase II (UvrD), which functions in mismatch repair, does not affect mutagenesis levels from UV radiation but results in a very pronounced transient non-culturability pattern following UV exposure. Overall, our results further advance our understanding of bacterial adaptation mechanisms and the role of DNA repair pathways in shaping mutagenesis.</description>

      <title>Abstract 4143506: Inflammation but not Coronary Atherosclerotic Burden Is Related to Oxygen Uptake On-Kinetics in the 6-Minute Walk Test</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1161/circ.150.suppl_1.4143506</link>
      <description>Isadora S. Rocco, Walter J. Gomes, Caroline Bublitz, Isis Begot Krainer, Nelson Am&#233;rico Hossne, Ross Arena, Solange Guizilini, Circulation. 150(Suppl_1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4404359658

                Background: Anatomic burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) has been considered a consistent prognostic marker. Inflammation also increases the cardiovascular risk and plays a significant role in the evolution of atherosclerosis. The progression of CAD impacts the responses to exercise, reducing functional capacity. Despite this knowledge, the specific interplay between inflammation and atherosclerotic burden in influencing submaximal exercise capacity, particularly oxygen uptake (VO 2 ) kinetics, remains underexplored in CAD. This study aims to investigate how these factors correlate with VO 2 on-kinetics in the Six-minute Walk Test (6MWT) in patients with CAD. METHODS: Patients with obstructive CAD, confirmed by coronary angiography, underwent a 6MWT using a mobile telemetric cardiopulmonary monitoring to assess functional capacity and the VO 2 on-kinetics through the mean response time corrected by work (wMRT). Inflammatory markers were analyzed by dosage of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interferon-gama, tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukins (IL), IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10. Coronary atherosclerotic burden was evaluated by the Grading Scale for Anatomic Burden of Disease from COURAGE Trial. Correlation analyses were performed according to the symmetric distribution of data, using Pearson&#8217;s (r) or Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficients(r s ). RESULTS: A total of thirty-four patients aged between 60.3&#177;8.0 years were enrolled, presenting body mass index of 26.0&#177;3.7kg/cm 2 , left ventricular ejection fraction of 0.50&#177;0.14, walking distance of 443&#177;66m, VO 2 at steady-state (VO 2SS ) of 896&#177;240ml/min and wMRT of 1.64x10 -3 &#177; 1.00x10 -3 min 2 /ml. Although correlated with distance and VO 2SS (r=-0.472;p=0.002 and r=-0.434;p=0.015, respectively), atherosclerotic burden was not associated with wMRT (p=0.17). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein and IL-8 were negatively associated with both distance and VO 2SS (r s =-0.428;p=0.001/ r s =-0.543;p=0.001 and r s =-0.438;p=0.014/ r s =-0.407;p=0.019) and positively correlated with wMRT (r s =0.412;p=0.022/ r s =0.505;p=0.003). CONCLUSION: In contrast to anatomic burden, inflammatory markers were associated with both walking intensity and VO 2 kinetics. Therefore, inflammation may be more crucial to exercise response mechanisms than coronary stenosis, suggesting a paradigm shift in our understanding of clinical repercussions of obstructive CAD. Actions able to attenuate the inflammatory profile may improve exercise capacity and prognosis.</description>
