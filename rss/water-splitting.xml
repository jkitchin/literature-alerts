      <title>Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution with Prussain Blue Coated ZnO Origami Core&#8208;Shell Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cphc.202400817</link>

                The design and development of particulate photocatalysts has been an attractive strategy to incorporate earth&#8208;abundant metal ions to water splitting devices. Herein, we synthesized CoFe&#8208;Prussian blue (PB) coated ZnO origami core&#8208;shell nanostructures (PB@ZnO) with different mass ratio of PB components and investigated their photocatalytic water oxidation activities in the presence of an electron scavenger. Photocatalytic experiments reveal that the integration of PB on ZnO boosts the oxygen evolution rate by a factor of ~2.4 compared to bare ZnO origami. We ascribe this increased photocatalytic rate to an improved charge carrier separation and transfer due to the formation of heterojunction at the interface between PB and ZnO. Long&#8208;term photocatalytic experiments indicate that the activity and stability of the catalyst was preserved up to 9 h. Our results indicate that the core&#8208;shell PB@ZnO particles possess a proper band energy alignment for the photocatalytic water oxidation process.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Atomic Environment Optimization of Nickel&#8211;Iron Dual Sites by Co Doping and Cr Vacancy for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c14675</link>
      <description>Hua&#8208;Jie Niu, Nian Ran, Wei Zhou, Wei An, Chuanxue Huang, Wenxing Chen, Min Zhou, Wen-Feng Lin, Jianjun Liu, Lin Guo, Journal of the American Chemical Society. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406164462

                The dual-site synergistic catalytic mechanism on NiFeOOH suggests weak adsorption of Ni sites and strong adsorption of Fe sites limited its activity toward alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Large-scale density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that Co doping can increase Ni adsorption, while the metal vacancy can reduce Fe adsorption. The combined two factors can further modulate the atomic environment and optimize the free energy toward oxygen-containing intermediates, thus enhancing the OER activity. Accordingly, we used Co doping and Cr vacancies to fabricate an amorphous catalyst of VCr,Co-NiFeOOH. It provides an OER overpotential of 239 mV at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 and high stability over 500 h at 500 mA cm&#8211;2 with a &#8764;98% potential retention. The resulting water electrolyzer based on an anion exchange membrane (AEM) exhibits a remarkable performance of 1 A cm&#8211;2 at 1.68 V in 1 M KOH. XPS, soft-XAS, and XANES combined with Bader charge analysis results reveal that the regulation of the local microenvironment can increase the valence state of Ni by Co doping, thus improving the adsorption energy on Ni sites. The Cr vacancy can alleviate the strong adsorption on Fe sites. DFT calculations confirm that the synergistic effect of Co doping and Cr vacancies can redistribute the charge on the Ni/Fe sites, optimize the d-band center of Ni and Fe, and endow the catalyst with Ni&#8211;Fe dual sites to reduce the energy barrier of the OER rate-determining step.</description>

      <description>Sadam Hussain, Manzar Sohail, Nadia Shahzad, Geoffrey Will, Anthony P. O&#8217;Mullane, Ahmed Abdala, Ibrahim A. Alnaser, Mohammad Rezaul Karim, Md A. Wahab, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406167842

                The strategic design and fabrication of efficient electrocatalysts are pivotal for advancing the field of electrochemical water splitting (EWS). To enhance EWS performance, integrating non-noble transition metal catalysts through a cooperative double metal incorporation strategy is important and offers a compelling alternative to conventional precious metal-based materials. This study introduces a novel, straightforward, single-step process for fabricating a bimetallic MoCo catalyst integrated within a three-dimensional (3D) nanoporous network of N, P-doped carbon nitride derived from a self-contained precursor. The subsequent carbonization at 550 &#176;C yields a highly effective bimetallic phosphide carbon nitride electrocatalyst, denoted as MoCoPCN, tailored explicitly for EWS. The MoCoPCN electrocatalyst demonstrates exceptional electrocatalytic performance, with a low onset potential of 1.43 V and an overpotential value of 202 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 49.5 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), respectively. Moreover, the catalyst exhibits a high electrochemically active surface area of 2720 cm&#8211;2, a small Tafel slope of 47.5 mV dec&#8211;1 for HER and 45.7 mV dec&#8211;1 for the OER, and a low charge transfer resistance of 0.09 &#937; for the HER and 0.805 &#937; for the OER. The optimal catalyst was tested for overall water splitting performance in a 1 M KOH electrolyte, demonstrating excellent efficiency with a low cell voltage of 1.49 V required to achieve a current density of 10 mA/cm2. These outstanding characteristics, combined with the synergistic effects arising from the interaction between MoCo and P-g-C3N4 (PCN), underscore the potential of a bimetallic phosphide carbon nitride material as a highly promising electrocatalyst for efficient water splitting.</description>

      <title>Controlled Structural Activation of Iridium Single Atom Catalyst for High-Performance Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c11442</link>

                Iridium single atom catalysts are promising oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE), as they can reduce the reliance on costly Ir in the OER catalysts. However, their practical application is hindered by their limited stability during PEMWE operation. Herein, we report on the activation of Ir-doped CoMn2O4 in acidic electrolyte that leads to enhanced activity and stability in acidic OER for long-term PEMWE operation. In-depth material characterization combined with electrochemical analysis and theoretical calculations reveal that activating Ir-doped CoMn2O4 induces controlled restructuring of Ir single atoms to IrOx nanoclusters, resulting in an optimized Ir configuration with outstanding mass activity of 3562 A gIr&#8211;1 at 1.53 V (vs RHE) and enhanced OER stability. The PEMWE using activated Ir-doped CoMn2O4 exhibited a stable operation for &gt;1000 h at 250 mA cm&#8211;2 with a low degradation rate of 0.013 mV h&#8211;1, demonstrating its practical applicability. Furthermore, it remained stable for more than 400 h at a high current density of 1000 mA cm&#8211;2, demonstrating long-term durability under practical operation conditions.</description>

      <title>Charge Equalization Strategy for Regulating Key Intermediate Adsorption on Bifunctional Fecr-Ni3s2 to Boost Seawater Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5087548</link>
      <description>Haodong Qi, Kai Huang, Wen Zeng, Cheng Lian, Honglai Liu, Jun Hu, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406172809

                Seawater splitting offers a sustainable way to meet the crises of globe warming and energy shortage. Bifunctional electrocatalysts for both oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction (OER, HER) and naturally resistant for chlorine evolution reaction (CER) are highly anticipated. Here, we developed a charge equalization strategy through bimetallic doping and successfully constructed bifunctional electrocatalysts of FeCr-Ni3S2 by the in-situ growth on the Nickel foam (NF). After composition optimization, FeCr-Ni3S2 exhibits both excellent catalytic OER and HER performance. DFT calculations reveal the bimetallic doping of Fe and Cr in Ni3S2 synergistically drives the d-band center of Ni away from its Fermi energy level and weakens the activity of Ni site. Owing to this charge equalization, *O intermediate adopts a hetero-bidentate adsorption configuration of Ni-O-Cr. Consequently, the potential determining step of *OOH adsorption reversely transports on the Cr site, providing a significant reduction of the energy barrier and prompting intrinsic activity of the sluggish OER. As a result, the overall seawater splitting only requires 1.824 V to achieve a current density of 500 mA cm-2. Most importantly, the overpotential of 307 mV was achieved on FeCr-Ni3S2 in the alkaline natural seawater, which is much lower than that the overpotential of 490 mV required to trigger the CER. More significantly, when coupling with the urea oxidation reaction (UOR), the voltage of the urea-assisted seawater splitting keeps on decreasing to 1.676 V stably for 500 h, superior to all state-of-the-arts works, which offers a feasible strategy for achieving energy-efficient seawater electrolysis hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>Mixed Ionic Conductor Brings Extra Gain in Oxygen-Evolving Activity of Nife Hydroxide Electrocatalyst at Practical Working Temperature</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5086992</link>
      <description>Lu Li, Liqi Bai, Sixuan She, Gao Chen, Haitao Huang, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406174854

                Industrial water electrolysis typically occurs at temperatures higher than ambient. The anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis is inherently temperature-dependent, with enhancements in thermodynamics and kinetics at higher temperatures. However, it is often overlooked that material properties at elevated temperatures can differ significantly from those at room temperature. In this study, NiFe-based layered double hydroxide (LDH)/CeO2 is utilized as anodic electrocatalyst for both ambient- and elevated-temperature water/seawater electrolysis. The optimal catalyst displays favorable oxygen conductivity and thus enhanced OER activity. The partial coverage of LDH with CeO2 effectively mitigates direct chlorine adsorption. Additionally, its high proton conductivity prevents proton accumulation within LDH interlayers and ensures stability. Notably, the enhanced mixed ionic conductivities at elevated temperature contribute to significant improvements in OER performance. This study underscores the effectiveness of employing mixed ionic conductors for OER and highlights the importance of characterizing OER process under elevated temperature for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Boosting Water Oxidation Kinetics of Bivo4 Through a Metal-Organic Co-Catalyst Enriched with Phosphate Groups (Co,Fe-Ntmp): Insights from Lmct Mechanism and Dft Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5086994</link>
      <description>Alaa Magdy Saad, A. Hussein, Mostafa Saad Sayed, Ga-Yeong Kim, Min Kyu Kim, Woo Kyoung Kim, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406176258

                The primary challenges of BiVO4 include its poor stability and inefficient electron-hole pair separation. To enhance BiVO4 photoanode oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a Co,Fe- nitrilotris (methylene phosphonic acid) (Co,Fe-NTMP) metal-organic co-catalyst was developed and applied to the BiVO4 photoelectrode surface using the SILAR technique. The proposed approach significantly improved charge separation and transfer. The optimized BiVO4/Co,Fe-NTMP photoanode exhibited a current density of 2.6 mA cm-2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, representing more than a fivefold increase compared to bare BiVO4 (0.5 mA cm-2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE) under illumination of AM 1.5 G without a sacrificial agent. Additionally, the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of BiVO4/Co,Fe-NTMP reached 0.58% at 0.83 V vs. RHE. The &#8710;OCP measurements indicated improved band bending and enhanced charge separation following the Co,Fe-NTMP coating. The BiVO4/Co,Fe-NTMP photoanode also demonstrated remarkable stability for 9000 s, which can be attributed to the formation of ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), which facilitates efficient electron transport. This mechanism was substantiated by XPS and DFT analyses.</description>

                Deactivation of the dimensionally stable anode (DSA) restricts their long-term service in the harsh electrolysis industries. In this work, Ti/IrxPb1&#8211;xO2/RuIrSnO2 electrodes with enhanced electrochemical stability were prepared by the thermal decomposition method. Compared with Ti/RuIrSnO2 electrode (95 h), the accelerated service lifetime of Ti/Ir0.7Pb0.3O2/RuIrSnO2 electrode (245 h) was increased by 2.5 times. The increase of the Ir:Pb ratio in IrxPb1&#8211;xO2 interlayer enhanced the oxygen evolution reaction activity and stability of the interlayer to some extent. The electrochemical stability of the RuIrSnO2 layer was closely associated with an electrochemical property of introduced IrxPb1&#8211;xO2 interlayers. This was because once the cracks in the electrode extended to the interlayer, the local defects with high oxygen evolution reaction activity tended to preferentially convert active oxygen species into O2. It impeded the permeation of active oxygen species through oxide matrix to passivate the substrate. This work provided an effective strategy to prolong the service lifetime of DSA.</description>

                Abstract Developing efficient, economical, and stable catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction is pivotal for producing large&#8208;scale green hydrogen in the future. Herein, a vanadium&#8208;doped nickel&#8208;iron oxide supported on nickel foam (V&#8208;NiFe 2 O 4 /NF) is introduced, and synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method as a highly efficient electrocatalyst for water electrolysis. X&#8208;ray photoelectron and absorption spectroscopies reveal a synergistic interaction between the vanadium dopant and nickel/iron in the host material, which tunes the electronic structure of NiFe 2 O 4 to increase the number of electrochemically active sites. The V&#8208;NiFe 2 O 4 /NF electrode exhibited superior electrochemical performance, with a low overpotential of 186 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , a Tafel slope value of 54.45 mV dec &#8722;1 , and minimal charge transfer resistance. Employing the V&#8208;NiFe 2 O 4 /NF electrode as an anode in an alkaline anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer single&#8208;cell, a cell voltage of 1.711 V is required to achieve a high current density of 1.0 A cm &#8722;2 . Remarkably, the cell delivered an energy conversion efficiency of 73.30% with enduring stability, making it a promising candidate for industrial applications.</description>

                Abstract Oxygen vacancy (V O ) engineering is widely regarded as a key strategy for enhancing CoMo&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) while understanding their formation mechanisms and role in boosting OER activity remains a significant challenge. Herein, a CoMoO x system doped is developed with different 3 d &#8208;orbital atoms M (V, Ni, Zn, and Mn) to investigate the construction and stabilization of V O and its crucial role in OER performance. In situ and ex situ measurements along with theoretical calculations demonstrate that V doping adjusts the bandgap between the CoMo&#8208; d and O &#8208;p orbitals, leading to the transfer of electrons from the O&#8208; p orbitals to the M&#8208; d orbitals, thereby promoting the formation of V O . The formation of V O leads to an upshifted d &#8208;band center, optimizing the desorption of oxygen intermediates on V O &#8208;CoMoVO x and lowering the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS), thereby enhancing the catalyst's activity. Additionally, V doping promotes electron transfer from Co to V atoms, stabilizing the V O and ultimately improving the catalyst's stability. The resulting V O &#8208;CoMoVO x catalyst delivered attractive activity (overpotential of 248 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and durability over 600 h. This study offers a rational method for designing efficient OER electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract This study explores the effect of nickel cobalt oxide (Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;O) anode layer microstructure on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Four anodes with similar Ni&#8208;Co&#8208;O loadings and chemical characteristics but distinct morphologies are fabricated by ultrasonic spraying catalyst inks of varying solvent composition (pure water versus a water&#8208;ethanol mixture) and drying temperatures (50 and 150 &#176;C) on nickel (Ni) plates. Upon varying solvent composition, particles in the water&#8208;based ink exhibited lower stability than particles in the water&#8208;ethanol&#8208;based ink, boosting the particle connectivity in the layers. This particle connectivity correlated with the mechanical strength of the layers, resulting in reduced contact resistance and enhanced activity. The second observation is that at 50 &#176;C, the surface morphology exhibited hill&#8208;like islands with higher roughness, while at 150 &#176;C, concave hemispherical shapes with lower roughness are observed. From 2D&#8208;distribution data, it is found that surface roughness correlated with the wettability with electrolyte. Roughness increased the lyophobicity and enhanced the activity through more accessible active sites and efficient bubble transport. This work highlights how microstructure affects macroscopic layer properties, and how these in turn can enhance or diminish the performance of the OER compared to bare Ni, offering insights into the knowledge&#8208;based design of anode layers.</description>

      <title>Surface S-Doped Nanostructured RuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Its Anion Passivating Effect for Efficient Overall Seawater Splitting</title>

                Electrolysis of seawater for hydrogen (H2) production to harvest clean energy is an appealing approach. In this context, there is an urgent need for catalysts with high activity and durability. RuO2 electrocatalysts have shown efficient activity in the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER), but they still suffer from poor stability. Herein, surface S-doped nanostructured RuO2 (S-RuO2) is rationally fabricated for efficient overall seawater splitting. Doping with S enhances the activity (overpotentials of 25 mV for the HER and 243 mV for the OER), long-term durability (1000 h at 100 mA cm&#8211;2), and achieves nearly 100% Faraday efficiency (FE). Moreover, the S-RuO2-based anion exchange membrane seawater electrolyzer requires 2.01 V to reach 1.0 A cm&#8211;2 under demanding industrial conditions. Experimental analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that surface S introduction could lower the valence state of Ru, thereby conferring enhanced activity and stability. Furthermore, the nanostructured S-RuO2 electrocatalyst is highly protected by the S-doped surface, which repels Cl&#8211; in alkaline seawater. This investigation presents a feasible strategy for designing RuO2-based seawater splitting catalysts with both high performance and good resistance to anodic corrosion.</description>

                A catalyst for an electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key component of the large&#8208;scale storage of renewable energy through the conversion of water into oxygen and hydrogen. Iron&#8208;based selenide materials are currently being considered as potential options for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) because of their, widespread availability, inexpensive cost, and outstanding performance. In this study, we employed a thermal decomposition method to synthesize all stable phases of the Fe&#8208;Se system, including Fe7Se8, Fe3Se4, FeSe2, and FeSe. Additionally, we slurry&#8208;coated these phases onto a 3D nickel foam substrate. The prepared three&#8208;dimensional electrodes of Fe7Se8, Fe3Se4, FeSe2, and FeSe exhibit remarkably low overpotentials of 270, 276, 299, and 289 mV at a current density of 50 mA/cm2 for OER. In addition, the catalytic activity for OER is also tested on glassy carbon electrodes to compare its performance with the Ni&#8208;foam 3D substrate. The Fe7Se8 phase in the Fe&#8208;Se system exhibits the highest catalytic activity towards OER on both substrates due to variations in the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio and the presence of Fe vacancies (cation vacancies) within the crystal lattice. Moreover, a faradaic efficiency of 98% was exhibited by Fe7Se8 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).</description>

      <title>Vs2-Incorporated Nis/Nis2/Zn-Doped Nimoo4 Nanosheet Arrays on Nickel Foam with Multiphase Heterointerface as Highly Efficient Alkaline Electrocatalysts for Overall Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.5091049</link>
      <description>Lina Jia, Gaohui Du, Qingmei Su, Huayv Li, Shixian Chen, Bingshe Xu, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406210180

                Exploring and developing highly active and low-cost transition metal-based electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and overall water splitting in alkaline media is greatly significant for achieving large-scale applications of sustainable clean energy. Herein, we reported the preparation of VS2/NiSx-Zn-NiMoO4 porous nanosheet arrays grown on nickel foam (NF) with rich multiphase interfacial structures via transition metal doping and sulfurization, and its electrocatalytic properties of HER, OER and overall water splitting were studied. The doping of the NiMoO4 host material with transition metal cations (Zn2+) optimizes its electronic structure and generates abundant active sites, thus accelerating the OER reaction kinetics. The formation of transition metal nickel-based sulfides (NiS and NiS2) is beneficial for improving the conductivity of the material. Meanwhile, the introduction of VS2 also promotes the adsorption and transport efficiency of intermediate hydrogen atoms, thereby enhancing HER activity. The multiphase interfaces in VS2/NiSx-Zn-NiMoO4 nanosheets synergistically modulated NiMoO4, which fully utilized the advantages of each material to accelerate electron transfer and induce synergistic catalytic effects to achieve excellent electrocatalytic performance. When VS2/NiSx-Zn-NiMoO4/NF was used as catalyst for HER and OER in an alkaline solution, it required only 162 and 118 mV overpotential at 100 mA cm-2, respectively. Furthermore, the water electrolyser system constructed by using it as the cathode and anode showed excellent performance, requiring only 1.60 V cell voltage to reach 100 mA cm-2 and showing excellent stability. This work provides a new perspective for the application of transition metal molybdates in highly efficient electrocatalysts for alkaline water splitting through reasonable structural optimization.</description>

                Abstract Understanding the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism is pivotal for improving the overall efficiency of water electrolysis. Despite methylammonium lead halide perovskites (MAPbX 3 ) have shown promising OER performance due to their soft&#8208;lattice nature that allows lattice&#8208;oxygen oxidation of active &#945;&#8208;PbO 2 layer surface, the role of A&#8208;site MA or X&#8208;site elements in the electrochemical reconstruction and OER mechanisms has yet to be explored. Here, it is demonstrated that the OER mechanism of perovskite@zeolite composites is intrinsically dominated by the A&#8208;site group of lead&#8208;halide perovskites, while the type of X&#8208;site halogen is crucial for the reconstruction kinetics of the composites. Using CsPbBr x I 3&#8208; x @AlPO&#8208;5 ( x = 0, 1, 2, 3) as a model OER catalyst, it is found that the CsPbBr 3 @AlPO&#8208;5 behaves oxygen&#8208;intercalation pseudocapacitance during surface restructuring due to absence of halogen&#8208;ion migration and phase separation in the CsPbBr 3 , achieving a larger diffusion rate of OH &#8722; within the core&#8208;shell structure. Moreover, distinct from the single&#8208;metal&#8208;site mechanism of MAPbBr 3 @AlPO&#8208;5, experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the soft lattice nature of CsPbBr 3 triggers the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;site mechanism via the CsPbBr 3 /&#945;&#8208;PbO 2 interface, resulting in excellent OER performance. Owing to the variety and easy tailoring of lead&#8208;halide perovskite compositions, these findings pave a way for the development of novel perovskite@zeolite type catalysts for efficient oxygen electrocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Introducing Sulfur in VNi-Layered Double Hydroxide Enables Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Benzylamine with High Current Densities</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c20149</link>

                The replacement of the thermodynamically unfavorable anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with a more favorable organic oxidation reaction, such as the anodic oxidation of benzylamine, has garnered significant interest in hybrid water electrolyzer cells. This approach promises the production of value-added chemicals alongside hydrogen fuel generation, improving overall energy efficiency. However, achieving high current density for benzylamine oxidation without interference from OER remains a challenge, limiting the practical efficiency of the electrolyzer cell. In this study, we investigated a room temperature method for sulfur introduction in VNi-layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalyst and its application for electrocatalytic benzylamine oxidation. The S-introduction in VNi-LDH was found to modulate the electronic states of nickel and vanadium, increasing the number of active sites, electrochemical surface area, and charge transfer properties. The resulting S-VNi-LDH catalyst achieved a high current density of 400 mA cm&#8211;2 at only 1.39 V vs RHE potential for benzylamine oxidation, avoiding interference from oxygen evolution. The catalyst demonstrated 100% selectivity (Faradaic Efficiency = 98.6%) for the conversion of benzylamine into benzonitrile within 2.5 h of the reaction. In a two-electrode electrolysis system, S-VNi-LDH achieved a current density of 400 mA cm&#8211;2 at a cell voltage of 1.50 V when OER was substituted with benzylamine oxidation. The S-VNi-LDH showed energy consumption of 4.67 kWh/m3 H2 for OER and 1.31 kWh/m3 H2 during benzylamine oxidation, indicating a high energy efficiency with exceptional stability over five cycles, maintaining 98.6 &#177; 0.4% FE and consistent voltage. The S-VNi-LDH also oxidized various amines, including substituted benzylamines and secondary amines, achieving high conversion (95&#8211;97%) and faradaic efficiency (85.8&#8211;98%). This study presents an eco-friendly, room-temperature method for S-doping in VNi-LDH, which out performed the reported catalysts in the literature.</description>

                Electrochemical biomass upgrading is a promising substitute for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to generate valuable chemicals in conjunction with hydrogen generation. Pursuing highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts for significant concentration levels (&#8805; 50 mM) of biomass electrooxidation remains an enduring challenge. Herein, we introduce a robust Cu-supported CoFe Prussian blue analogue (CoFe PBA/CF) electrocatalyst, adept at facilitating high-concentration (50 mM) 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) oxidation into 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA), achieving an exceptional HMF conversion (100%) with a notable FDCA yield of 98.4%. The influence of copper substrate and adsorption energy are therefore discussed. Impressively, the CoFe PBA/CF electrode sustains considerable durability in a continuous-flow electrochemical reactor designed for consecutive FDCA production, showcasing FDCA yields of 100/94% at flow rates of 0.4/0.8 mL&#183;min-1 over 60 h&#8217; uninterrupted electrolysis. This work provides a promising strategy to develop highly efficient and robust electrocatalysts for the consecutive production of high-value products coupled with green H2 production.</description>

                Abstract The industrial application of green hydrogen production from water electrolysis strongly depends on the invention of low&#8208;cost, highly&#8208;active, and stable nonprecious electrocatalysts for an oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this work, a two&#8208;step process is developed to prepare a NiCo&#8208;Se/CFP bimetallic electrocatalyst by a low&#8208;temperature selenization of NiCo&#8208;PBA precursors electro&#8208;deposited on carbon fibre paper. The NiCo&#8208;Se/CFP bimetallic electrocatalyst exhibits good catalytic activity for the OER, with an overpotential of 307 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , and a Tafel slope of only 39.94 mV dec &#8722;1 in 1 M KOH. The steady current density and well&#8208;preserved microscopic morphology during the 20 h electrolysis proves its outstanding stability. The high inherent activity of the electrocatalyst is attributed to the 3D porous structure, the synergistic effects of Ni, and Co active components doping, and low&#8208;temperature selenization. The results provide an insightful reference for further improving composition and structure design while investigating nonprecious metal electrocatalysts.</description>

                Abstract Oxygen vacancy (OV) defect engineering plays a crucial role in enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. However, the direct visual characterization of oxygen vacancies still remains technically limited. Herein, a bismuth titanate (Bi 4 Ti 3 O 12 , BTO&#8208;OV) model photocatalyst containing oxygen vacancies is constructed through density functional theory (DFT) calculations to reveal the influence mechanism of distinctive periodic quantum well and oxygen vacancies on the charge transfer behavior in BTO. Notably, the distribution of oxygen vacancies is directly observed using the low&#8208;dose integrated differential phase contrast&#8208;scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM), providing visual evidence for the location of these oxygen vacancies in BTO&#8208;OV. Furthermore, the theoretical calculation results are verified by characterizing the photoelectric properties and conducting performance tests on the hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) photosynthesis. Specifically, the oxygen vacancies and distinctive periodic quantum well in BTO&#8208;OV accelerate charge separation, leading to a H 2 O 2 photosynthesis efficiency reaching 5278 &#181; m g &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 , which is 5 times that of the original BTO. This work offers theoretical and experimental references for the visual characterization of oxygen vacancies and the improvement of the charge transfer mechanism.</description>

                Transition&#8208;metal nitrides (TMNs) have garnered considerable attention for energy conversion applications owing to their exceptional electronic structures and high catalytic activities. However, the scarcity of active sites in TMNs impedes their large&#8208;scale application. This study describes the use of wetness impregnation and ionic&#8208;liquid methods to enhance the electrocatalytic efficiency of molybdenum nitride (MoN) atomic clusters finely dispersed on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (MoN@NC) substrates. The as&#8208;synthesized electrocatalysts feature atomically dispersed MoN clusters, achieving an impressive onset potential of 0.93 V vs. RHE for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and maintaining an overpotential of just 295 mV at a current density of 10 mA/cm2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The MoN@NC&#8208;based zinc&#8211;air battery demonstrated a high&#8208;power density of 151 mW/cm2, a robust specific discharge capacity of 759 mAh/gZn at 20 mA/cm2, and superior charge&#8211;discharge cycling stability exceeding 190 cycles. The detailed experimental characterization revealed that the uniformly dispersed MoN clusters served as the primary active sites driving the observed catalytic performance. Additionally, the present findings suggested significant correlations between the phase of the material, crystallization, atomic cluster distribution, support porosity, and nitridation temperature. These insights are expected to refine strategies for achieving atomically dispersed nitrides with optimized ORR performance.</description>

                Developing durable IrO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity under acidic condition is crucial for proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. While oxygen defects are considered potentially important in OER, their direct relationship with catalytic activity has yet to be established. In this study, we introduced abundant oxygen vacancies through Re doping in 2D IrO2 (Re0.03Ir0.97O2), demonstrating their decisive role in enhancing OER performance. The Re0.03Ir0.97O2 catalyst exhibited excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 193 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and sustained activity for over 650 hours, significantly surpassing the undoped catalyst. Moreover, it maintained operation at a cell voltage of 1.70 V (~1200 mA cm&#8208;2) for over 140 hours without significant performance degradation. Theoretical calculations coupled with cyclic voltammetry, transient potential scanning and in&#8208;situ characterizations confirmed the adsorbate evolving mechanism on Re0.03Ir0.97O2, as well as the critical role of Re&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies in enhancing OER performance. These findings highlight that oxygen defects directly influence OER activity, providing guidance for the application of oxygen vacancy engineering in electrocatalyst design.</description>

      <title>Chloride Residues in RuO2 Catalysts Enhance Its Stability and Efficiency for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202420860</link>
      <description>Huile Jin, Jiadong Chen, Menghui Qi, Yun Yang, Xiaofen Xiao, Ying Li, Yong Wang, Angewandte Chemie International Edition. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406255437

                Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) is a benchmark electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE), but its stability during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is often compromised by lattice oxygen involvement and metal dissolution. Despite that the typical synthesis of RuO2 produces chloride residues, the underlying function of chloride have not well investigated. In this study, we synthesized chlorine&#8208;containing RuO2 (RuO2&#8208;Cl) and pure RuO2 catalysts with similar morphology and crystallinity. RuO2&#8208;Cl demonstrated superior stability, three times greater than that of pure RuO2, and a lower overpotential of 176 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, the RuO2&#8208;Cl catalysts that were in situ synthesized on a platinum&#8208;coated titanium felt could maintain high performance for up to 1200 hours at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. Computational and experimental analyses show that chloride stabilizes RuO2 by substituting the bridging oxygen atoms, which subsequently inhibits lattice oxygen evolution and Ru demetallation. Notably, this substitution also lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step by strengthening the binding of *OOH intermediates. These findings offer new insights into the previously unknown role of chloride residues and how to improve RuO2 stability.</description>

                The complexity of the intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanism, particularly the precise relationships between the local coordination geometry of active metal centers and the resulting OER kinetics, remains to be fully understood. Herein, we construct a series of 3 d transition metal-incorporated cobalt hydroxide-based nanobox architectures for the OER which contain tetrahedrally coordinated Co(II) centers. Combination of bulk- and surface-sensitive operando spectroelectrochemical approaches reveals that tetrahedral Co(II) centers undergo a dynamic transformation into highly active Co(IV) intermediates acting as the true OER active species which activate lattice oxygen during the OER. Such a dynamic change in the local coordination geometry of Co centers can be further facilitated by partial Fe incorporation. In comparison, the formation of such active Co(IV) species is found to be hindered in CoOOH and Co-FeOOH, which are predominantly containing [CoIIIO6] and [CoII/FeIIIO6] octahedra, respectively, but no mono-&#956;-oxo-bridged [CoIIO4] moieties. This study offers a comprehensive view of the dynamic role of local coordination geometry of active metal centers in the OER kinetics. The oxygen evolution reaction and its relationship with metal center coordination remain unclear. Here, the authors report that optimization of the local coordination geometry of Co centers plays a crucial role in facilitating the O-O bond formation atop high-valent Co (IV) sites.</description>

                NiFe layered double hydroxide (LDH) currently are the most efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline environments. However, the development of high&#8208;performance low cost OER electrocatalysts using straightforward strategies remains a significant challenge. In this study, we describe an innovative microbial mineralization&#8208;based method for in situ&#8208;induced preparation of NiFe LDH nanosheets loaded on nickel foam and demonstrate that this material serves as an efficient oxygen evolution electrocatalyst. In the microbial mineralization process, bacteria adhere to electrode materials and promote the surface nucleation of nanomaterials when metal ions are present. Specifically, our findings indicate that biomineralization accelerates the formation and regulation of NiFe LDH. The new electrocatalyst displays excellent OER performance, with a small overpotential of 220 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope down to 38.6 mV dec&#8722;1 in alkaline solution. The remarkable OER performance of the microbial mineralization&#8208;derived electrocatalyst is attributed to the synergistic effect of NiFe LDH and a bacterial&#8208;specific surface area that contains multiple active sites. This study has uncovered a new approach for the assembly of NiFe LDH that relies on biomineralization to bring about morphological and structural modification of LDH nanosheets.</description>

                Abstract The success of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) depends on active and robust electrocatalysts to facilitate oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Heteroatom-doped-RuO x has emerged as a promising electrocatalysts because heteroatoms suppress lattice oxygen participation in the OER, thereby preventing the destabilization of surface Ru and catalyst degradation. However, identifying suitable heteroatoms and achieving their atomic-scale coupling with Ru atoms are nontrivial tasks. Herein, to steer the reaction pathway away from the involvement of lattice oxygen, we integrate OER-active Ir atoms into the RuO 2 matrix, which maximizes the synergy between stable Ru and active Ir centers, by leveraging the changeable growth behavior of Ru/Ir atoms on lattice parameter-modulated templates. In PEMWE, the resulting (RuIr)O 2 /C electrocatalysts demonstrate notable current density of 4.96 A cm &#8722;2 and mass activity of 19.84 A mg Ru+Ir &#8722;1 at 2.0 V. In situ spectroscopic analysis and computational calculations highlight the importance of the synergistic coexistence of Ru/Ir-dual-OER-active sites for mitigating Ru dissolution via the optimization of the binding energy with oxygen intermediates and stabilization of Ru sites.</description>

                Abstract N&#8208;doped carbon confined alloy catalysts possess considerable potential in facilitating oxygen electrocatalytic reaction and consequent applications in metal air batteries, but the sluggish catalytic kinetics and high reaction barrier of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remain the bottleneck restricting its further development. Here, a novel CoFe&#8208;NiFe biphase alloy nanoheterojunction encapsulated within N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (CoFe&#8208;NiFe@NCNT) is fabricated via the hydrothermal carbothermic reduction approach. Owing to the plentiful active sites and high electrical conductance, the potential difference between OER and ORR amounts to merely 0.68 V. Simultaneously, the performance of the Zn&#8208;air and Mg&#8208;air batteries assembled by CoFe&#8208;NiFe@NCNT serving as the air&#8208;cathode are superior to that of commercial Pt/C + RuO 2 . The DFT outcomes reveal that the transformation between *OOH and *O is the rate&#8208;determining step (RDS) of ORR/OER. Also, the synergy between the biphase alloy heterojunction and N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes is conducive to reduce the reaction energy barrier. This study offers a profound understanding toward the structural design of biphase alloy nanoheterojunction electrocatalysts and the utilization in metal&#8208;air batteries for portable wearable electronic apparatuses.</description>

      <title>&lt;i&gt;In Situ&lt;/i&gt; Manipulation of Surface Spin Configurations for Enhanced Performance in Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.4c05609</link>
      <description>Chao Zhong, Wenda Zhou, Xingfang Luo, Tingfeng Li, Fujin Huang, Jie Hu, Zhenzhen Jiang, Ce Hu, Wen Lei, Cailei Yuan, Nano Letters. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406309081

                In situ studies of the relationship between surface spin configurations and spin-related electrocatalytic reactions are crucial for understanding how magnetic catalysts enhance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance under magnetic fields. In this work, 2D Fe7Se8 nanosheets with rich surface spin configurations are synthesized via chemical vapor deposition. In situ magnetic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy reveal that a 200 mT magnetic field eliminates spin-disordered domain walls, forming a spin-ordered single-domain structure, which lowers the OER energy barrier, as confirmed by theoretical calculations. Electrochemical tests show that under a 200 mT magnetic field, the OER overpotential of multidomain Fe7Se8 nanosheets at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 decreases from 346 mV to 259 mV, while the magnetic field has minimal effect on single-domain nanosheets. These findings highlight the critical role of spin configurations in enhancing electrocatalytic performance, offering new insights into the design of magnetic catalysts for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Solid-State Reaction Synthesis of CoSb2O6-Based Electrodes Towards Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Electrolytes: Effects of Calcination Time and Temperature</title>

                Mitigating global warming necessitates transitioning from fossil fuels to alternative energy carriers like hydrogen. Efficient hydrogen production via electrocatalysis requires high-performance, stable anode materials for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to support the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode. Developing noble metal-free electrocatalysts is therefore crucial, particularly for acidic electrolytes, to avoid reliance on scarce and expensive metals such as Ir and Ru. This study investigates a low-cost, solvent-free solid-state synthesis of CoSb2O6, focusing on the influence of calcination time and temperature. Six samples were prepared and characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) analysis, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and electrochemical techniques. A non-pure CoSb2O6 phase was observed across all samples. Electrochemical testing revealed good short-term stability; however, all samples exhibited Tafel slopes exceeding 200 mV dec&#8722;1 and overpotentials greater than 1 V. The sample calcined at 600 &#176;C for 6 h showed the best performance, with the lowest Tafel slope and overpotential, attributed to its high CoSb2O6 content and maximized {110} facet exposure. This work highlights the role of calcination protocols in developing Co-based OER catalysts and offers insights for enhancing their electrocatalytic properties.</description>

      <title>Decoding Dual&#8208;Functionality in N&#8208;doped Defective Carbon: Unveiling Active Sites for Bifunctional Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202411035</link>
      <description>Sakshi Bhardwaj, A. J. Pathak, Sabuj Kanti Das, Prasenjit Das, Ranjit Thapa, Ramendra Sundar Dey, Small. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406340062

                Abstract Oxygen electrocatalysis plays a pivotal role in energy conversion and storage technologies. The precise identification of active sites for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for developing an efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst. However, this remains a challenging endeavor. Here, it is demonstrated that metal&#8208;free N&#8208;doped defective carbon material derived from triazene derivative exhibits excellent bifunctional activity, achieving a notable &#916;E value of 0.72 V. Through comprehensive X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopic analyses, the active sites responsible for oxygen electrocatalysis are elucidated, resolving a long&#8208;standing issue. Specifically, pyridinic&#8208;N sites are crucial for ORR, while graphitic&#8208;N are good for OER. A predictive model utilizing &#960;&#8208;electron descriptors further aids in identifying these sites, with theoretical insights aligning with experimental results. Additionally, in situ ATR&#8208;FTIR spectroscopy provides clarity on reaction intermediates for both reactions. This research paves the way for developing metal&#8208;free, site&#8208;specific electrocatalysts for practical applications in energy technologies.</description>

      <title>Laser induced oxidation Raman spectroscopy as analysis tool for iridium-based oxygen evolution catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1039/d4cp03592e</link>
      <description>Stefan Speer, Sven Jovanovic, Alexandre Merlen, Francesco B&#224;rtoli, Kiran Kiran, N. Nijs-De Wolf, Andr&#233; Karl, Eva Jodat, R&#252;diger&#8208;A. Eichel, Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406346003

                The study of degradation behavior of electrocatalysts in an industrial context calls for rapid and efficient analysis methods. Optical methods like Raman spectroscopy fulfil these requirements and are thus predestined for this purpose. However, the iridium utilized in proton exchange membrane electrolysis (PEMEL) is Raman inactive in its metallic state. This work demonstrates the high oxidation sensitivity of iridium and its utilization in analysis of catalyst materials. Laser induced oxidation Raman spectroscopy (LIORS) is established as a novel method for qualitative, chemical and structural analysis of iridium catalysts. Differences in particle sizes of iridium powders drastically change oxidation sensitivity. Oxidation of the iridium powders to IrO2 occurred at a laser power density of 0.47 &#177; 0.06 mW &#956;m-2 for the 850 &#956;m powder and at 0.12 &#177; 0.06 mW &#956;m-2 and 0.019 &#177; 0.015 mW &#956;m-2 for the 50 &#956;m and 0.7-0.9 &#956;m powders respectively. LIORS was utilized to assess possible deterioration of an iridium electrocatalyst due to operation under electrolysis. The operating electrocatalyst exhibited higher oxidation sensitivity, suggesting smaller iridium particle size due to catalyst dissolution. Peak shifts of the IrO2 signal were utilized to assess differences in transformation temperatures. The operated electrocatalyst transformed to IrO2 at lower temperature (8 cm-1 redshift) relative to the pristine catalyst (10 cm-1 redshift), demonstrating that pre-oxidation of the iridium to amorphous IrOx during electrolysis diminishes the energy barrier needed for IrO2 formation. Thus, LIORS can be utilized as a straightforward screening method for the analysis of iridium electrocatalysts in the industrial application of PEMEL.</description>

      <title>Chloride Residues in RuO2 Catalysts Enhance Its Stability and Efficiency for Acidic Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202420860</link>
      <description>Huile Jin, Jiadong Chen, Menghui Qi, Yun Yang, Xiaofen Xiao, Ying Li, Yong Wang, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406255095

                Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) is a benchmark electrocatalyst for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE), but its stability during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is often compromised by lattice oxygen involvement and metal dissolution. Despite that the typical synthesis of RuO2 produces chloride residues, the underlying function of chloride have not well investigated. In this study, we synthesized chlorine&#8208;containing RuO2 (RuO2&#8208;Cl) and pure RuO2 catalysts with similar morphology and crystallinity. RuO2&#8208;Cl demonstrated superior stability, three times greater than that of pure RuO2, and a lower overpotential of 176 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2. Furthermore, the RuO2&#8208;Cl catalysts that were in situ synthesized on a platinum&#8208;coated titanium felt could maintain high performance for up to 1200 hours at 100 mA cm&#8208;2. Computational and experimental analyses show that chloride stabilizes RuO2 by substituting the bridging oxygen atoms, which subsequently inhibits lattice oxygen evolution and Ru demetallation. Notably, this substitution also lowers the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step by strengthening the binding of *OOH intermediates. These findings offer new insights into the previously unknown role of chloride residues and how to improve RuO2 stability.</description>

      <title>Correlation Between Conductivity and Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity in Perovskite Oxides CaMnO3-&#948;, Ca0.5Sr0.5MnO3-&#948; and SrMnO3-&#948;</title>

                The perovskite oxides CaMnO3-&#948;, Ca0.5Sr0.5MnO3-&#948;, and SrMnO3-&#948; were synthesized in air using a solid-state method, and their structural, electrical, and electrocatalytic properties were studied in relation to their oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Iodometric titration showed &#948; values of 0.05, 0.05, and 0.0, respectively, indicating that Mn is predominantly in the 4+ oxidation state across all materials, consistent with prior reports. Detailed characterization was performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), iodometric titration, and variable-temperature conductivity measurements. Four-point probe DC measurements revealed that CaMnO3-&#948; (&#948; = 0.05) has a semiconductive behavior over a temperature range from 25 &#176;C to 300 &#176;C, with its highest conductivity attributed to polaron activity. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 M KOH was employed to assess OER catalytic performance, which correlated with room-temperature conductivity. CaMnO3-&#948; exhibited superior catalytic activity, followed by Ca0.5Sr0.5MnO3-&#948; and SrMnO3-&#948;, demonstrating that increased conductivity enhances OER performance. The conductivity trend, CaMnO3-&#948; &gt; Ca0.5Sr0.5MnO3-&#948; &gt; SrMnO3-&#948;, aligns with OER activity, underscoring a direct link between electronic transport properties and catalytic efficiency within this series.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the acidic oxygen evolution reaction efficiency of sol&#8211;gel synthesized SrCo0.5Ir0.5O3 catalysts through optimized ball milling and acid leaching</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0242496</link>
      <description>D.Z. Yang, Nicolai Sage Andreas, Ankit K. Yadav, Kyriakos C. Stylianou, Zhenxing Feng, APL Energy. 3(1)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406329854

                High-efficiency and low-cost catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic electrolytes are critical for electrochemical water splitting in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers to produce green hydrogen, a clean fuel for sustainable energy conversion and storage. Among OER catalysts, solid-state synthesized SrCo1&#8722;xIrxO3 has demonstrated superior activity compared to commercial standards, such as IrO2 and RuO2. However, the solid-state synthesis process is economically inefficient for industrial use due to the potential for impurities and low yield of the final product. In addition, the requirement for electrochemical cycling to activate the catalyst introduces contaminations and uncertainties for industrial applications. In this study, a modified solution-based sol&#8211;gel method was employed to produce SrCo0.5Ir0.5O3 (SCIO) with high purity and yield. Subsequent ball milling and acid leaching treatments were applied, resulting in a catalyst with higher efficiency than those activated solely by electrochemical cycling. The electrochemical analysis and physical characterizations of our SCIO catalyst after ex-situ post-synthesis treatments show a similar active phase in composition and structure to those obtained through in situ electrochemical cycling and activation. Our approach simplifies the preparation process, making the catalyst ready for direct use in PEM electrolyzers without further treatment, offering a promising solution for producing high-performance, industrial-scale OER catalysts.</description>

                Developing durable IrO2&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity under acidic condition is crucial for proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. While oxygen defects are considered potentially important in OER, their direct relationship with catalytic activity has yet to be established. In this study, we introduced abundant oxygen vacancies through Re doping in 2D IrO2 (Re0.03Ir0.97O2), demonstrating their decisive role in enhancing OER performance. The Re0.03Ir0.97O2 catalyst exhibited excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 193 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 and sustained activity for over 650 hours, significantly surpassing the undoped catalyst. Moreover, it maintained operation at a cell voltage of 1.70 V (~1200 mA cm&#8208;2) for over 140 hours without significant performance degradation. Theoretical calculations coupled with cyclic voltammetry, transient potential scanning and in&#8208;situ characterizations confirmed the adsorbate evolving mechanism on Re0.03Ir0.97O2, as well as the critical role of Re&#8208;induced oxygen vacancies in enhancing OER performance. These findings highlight that oxygen defects directly influence OER activity, providing guidance for the application of oxygen vacancy engineering in electrocatalyst design.</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen, a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, can be efficiently produced by electrochemical water splitting, which involves hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at the cathode and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode. Both HER and OER require electrocatalysts. The large scale implementation of this technology depends heavily on the development of highly active, stable, and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts. In view of this, several electrocatalysts have been explored. Herein, the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution performance of MnCO 3 synthesized by hydrothermal method is reported. While MnCO 3 is chosen as the electrocatalyst owing to cost&#8208;effect and abundant precursors, environmental friendliness, and good electrochemical activity, the hydrothermal method is chosen for its simplicity, efficiency, and scalability. The micron size MnCO 3 synthesized hydrothermally exhibits &#951; 10 of 143 mV, a Tafel slope of 72 mV dec &#8722;1 and retains its performance over 3000 cycles and 14 h of continuous operation in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 , demonstrating its utility in sustainable hydrogen production.</description>

      <description>Assegid Ergete, Yongfa Huang, Jiawei Zhou, Teklewold Getachew, Asmamaw Taye, Ruidong Xia, Emmanuel I. Iwuoha, Xinwen Peng, Shimelis Admassie, Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Ethiopia. 39(3)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4406243109

                Activated N-doped carbon derived from water hyacinth leaves (WHL) was prepared and investigated as metal-free bi-functional catalyst for oxygen reduction and evolution (ORR/OER) in zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) methods were used to examine the morphology, elemental composition and the specific surface area of the samples, respectively. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) at rotating disk electrodes (RDEs) and rotating ring-disk electrodes (RRDEs) were employed to characterize the electrocatalytic activities. The electrochemical studies reveal that N-doped porous carbon from N-WHLs exhibited remarkable electrocatalytic activity for ORR, with an onset potential of 0.95 V and half-wave potential of 0.88 V comparable to commercial Pt/C catalyst. It also displays promising activity towards OER, with an overall potential of 1.86 V versus RHE to reach a current density of 10 mAcm&#61485;&#61490;, resulting in an oxygen electrode activity (OEA) value of 0.98 V. The percentage of hydrogen peroxide produced was significantly low, with average electron transfer number value of 3.94 at 0.8 V for N-WHL. Furthermore, the ZAB using N-WHL catalysts as an air cathode displayed a power density of 84 mW cm&#8722;2 and superior stability over 450 hours.

                Abstract The design and fabrication of nanocatalysts with high accessibility and sintering resistance remain significant challenges in heterogeneous electrocatalysis. Herein, a novel catalyst is introduced that combines electronic pumping with alloy crystal facet engineering. At the nanoscale, the electronic pump leverages the chemical potential difference to drive electron migration from one region to another, separating and transferring electron&#8208;hole pairs. This mechanism accelerates the reaction kinetics and improves the reaction rate. The interface electronic structure optimization enables the CoFe/carbon nanotube (CNT) catalyst to exhibit outstanding oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance. Specifically, this catalyst achieves an ORR half&#8208;wave potential (E&#8321;/&#8322;) of 0.895 V, outperforming standard Pt/C and RuO&#8322; electrocatalysts in terms of both specific activity and stability. It also demonstrates excellent electrochemical performance for OER, with an overpotential of only 287 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8315; 2 . Theoretical calculations reveal that the carefully designed crystal facets reduce the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining steps for both ORR and OER, optimizing O&#8322; adsorption and promoting the oxygen capture process. This study highlights the potential of developing cost&#8208;effective bifunctional ORR&#8211;OER electrocatalysts, offering a promising strategy for advancing Zn&#8211;air battery technology.</description>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting (EWS) driven by renewable energy is vital for clean hydrogen (H 2 ) production and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. While IrO 2 and RuO 2 are the leading electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and Pt for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in acidic environments, the need for efficient, stable, and affordable materials persists. Recently, transition&#8208;metal borides (TMBs), particularly metal diborides (MDbs), have gained attention due to their unique layered crystal structures with multicentered boron bonds, offering remarkable physicochemical properties. Their nearly 2D structures boost electrochemical performance by offering high conductivity and a large active surface area, making them well&#8208;suited for advanced energy storage and conversion technologies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the critical factors for water splitting, the crystal and electronic structures of MDbs, and their synthetic strategies. Furthermore, it examines the relationship between catalytic performance and intermediate adsorption as elucidated by first&#8208;principle calculations. The review also highlights the latest experimental advancements in MDb&#8208;based electrocatalysts and addresses the current challenges and future directions for their development.</description>

                Developing clean and renewable energy technologies requires the design of efficient bifunctional catalysts that do not rely on inert metals for electrochemical water splitting. This study introduced a novel three-step strategy to fabricate NiCoFe-modified MoNi4/MoO2 nanowires supported on nickel foam substrates (denoted as NiCoFe-MoNi4/MoO2/NF), which demonstrate excellent catalytic performance with an impressively low overpotential of just 13 mV at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 current density for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and 230 mV at 50 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Notably, its performance greatly exceeded that of many noble-metal catalysts, requiring only 1.51 V for overall water splitting at 50 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 current density. The exceptional catalytic efficiency is ascribed to the unique one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure and the synergistic interactions between the NiCoFe complex and the MoNi4/MoO2 framework, which improve mass transfer, increase active site exposure, and enhance intrinsic catalytic activity. The incorporation of cobalt (Co) and iron (Fe) into the ternary complex significantly enhanced the efficiencies of both HER and OER, offering a promising route for developing high-performance, low-cost bifunctional electrocatalysts and advancing sustainable energy conversion technologies.</description>

                Abstract Enhancing the catalytic performance and durability of M&#8208;N&#9472;C catalyst is crucial for the efficient operation of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) and Zn&#8208;Air batteries (ZABs). Herein, an approach is developed for the in situ fabrication of a MOFs&#8208;derived porous carbon material, co&#8208;loaded with Co nanoparticles (NPs) and Co&#8208;N x sites and integrated onto Fe&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (CNTs), named Co NP/SA &#8208;NC/Fe&#8208;NCNTs. Incorporating polymer&#8208;wrapped CNTs improves MOFs dispersion annealing at high temperature, which amplifies the three&#8208;phase boundary (TPB) by generating much more mesopores and exposing additional active sites within the catalysts layer. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the presence of Co NPs promotes the conversion of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates for Co&#8208;N x sites. The optimized catalysts display a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.9 V (vs RHE) for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and a low overpotential of 327 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, which significantly outperforms the counterpart single structure, as well as noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. Specifically, the PEMFCs and ZABs derived from Co NP/SA &#8208;NC/Fe&#8208;NCNTs catalyst exhibit power densities of 702 and 192 mW cm &#8722;2 , respectively. This work offers novel insights into the synthesis of the composited bifunctional carbon materials for ZABs and PEMFCs application.</description>

                Methanol (ME) is a liquid hydrogen carrier, ideal for on-site-on-demand H2 generation, avoiding its costly and risky distribution issues, but this "ME-to-H2" electric conversion suffers from high voltage (energy consumption) and competitive oxygen evolution reaction. Herein, we demonstrate that a synergistic cofunctional Pt1Pdn/(Ni,Co)(OH)x catalyst with Pt single atoms (Pt1) and Pd nanoclusters (Pdn) anchored on OH-vacancy(VOH)-rich (Ni,Co)(OH)x nanoparticles create synergistic triadic active sites, allowing for methanol-enhanced low-voltage H2 generation. For MOR, OH* is preferentially adsorbed on Pdn and then interacts with the intermediates (such as *CHO or *CHOOH) adsorbed favorably on neighboring Pt1 with the assistance of hydrogen bonding from the surface hydrogen of (Ni,Co)(OH)x. The enhanced selectivity of the *CHOOH pathway, instead of *CO, sustains the MOR activity to a practically high current density. For HER, triadic Pt1, Pdn, and OH-vacancy sites on (Ni,Co)(OH)x create an "acid-base" microenvironment to facilitate water adsorption and splitting, forming H* species on Pt1 and Pdn, and *OH at the vacancy, to promote efficient H2 evolution from the asymmetric Pt1 and Pdn sites via the Tafel mechanism. The triadic-site synergy opens new avenues for the design and synthesis of highly efficient and stable cofunctional catalysts for "on-site-on-demand" H2 production, here facilitated by liquid methanol.</description>

                Abstract Developing overall water splitting non&#8208;noble metal electrocatalysts achieving long&#8208;term stability with high activity at industrial&#8208;grade current density remains challenging. Herein, a self&#8208;reconstruction strategy of Co 9 S 8 &#8208;Ni 3 S 2 /NCF is employed to fabricate Ni x Co 3&#8208;x O 4 &#8208;Ov&#8208; in which partial Co is replaced by Ni in the structure. The reconstructed Ni x Co 3&#8208;x O 4 &#8208;Ov can enhance the adsorbing ability of leached from the initial phase compared with Co spinel, achieving exceeding 1000&#8208;h oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and 600&#8208;h overall water splitting stability at 1000 mA cm &#8722;2 with excellent activity. In situ Raman and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that partial substitution of Ni for Co atoms enhances the adsorption capacity on the reconstructed Ni x Co 3&#8208;x O 4 &#8208;Ov, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;density Co 3+ active sites on (400) that expedited interfacial electron transfer at high current densities. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the adsorption of leached stabilizes surface oxygen vacancies and optimizes the adsorption energy of intermediates, thereby improving both stability and catalytic performance. The findings provide new insights into overcoming the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off and contribute to the strategy for the design of electrocatalysts for long&#8208;term water splitting at industrial&#8208;grade current densities.</description>

                As a transition material between bulk materials and individual atoms, nickel clusters have interesting electrical and structural characteristics that could make them useful as catalysts. To examine the catalytic efficiency of nickel clusters in different applications, this Review combines experimental techniques with density functional theory (DFT). Researchers have shown that nickel clusters can activate and alter tiny molecules like CO, NO, and H2 through DFT studies that delve deeply into their electronic structures, adsorption mechanisms, and stability. These findings lay the groundwork for the development of effective catalysts for various processes. Nickel clusters considerably improve the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), indicating their promise for renewable energy conversion. Furthermore, electrocatalysis for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) showcases the electrochemical performance of nickel clusters, demonstrating their stability and efficiency. The adaptability of nickel clusters is further demonstrated by their use in nitrogen reduction to ammonia. Experimental data confirm that these clusters are good catalysts for this crucial industrial activity. Hydrocarbon reforming and pollutant degradation are two areas in which research has shown that nickel clusters can be useful in thermal reactions. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and environmental transmission electron microscopy (ETEM) are examples of in situ characterization techniques that support theoretical predictions by providing real-time insights into the structural alterations and active sites of nickel clusters during these processes. Preparing the way for future research and practical applications in energy and environmental technologies, this thorough study highlights the great potential of nickel clusters in constructing sustainable and efficient catalytic systems.</description>

                With the rising levels of atmospheric CO2, electrochemistry shows great promise in decarbonizing industrial processes by converting CO2 into valuable products through scalable and sustainable technologies. In this framework, the present study investigates the solar-driven CO2 reduction toward carbon monoxide, achieved by the integration between the electrochemical reactor and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), both in experimental and modeling perspectives. COMSOL&#174; Multiphysics 6.3 was used to develop a detailed finite element method model of the electrochemical cell integrated with a photovoltaic module, validated with the experimental results that demonstrated a strong correlation. A 2D model was designed, incorporating cathode and anode regions divided by an ion-exchange membrane. The model includes platinum foil and silver nanoparticles as catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction and CO2 reduction reaction, respectively. Integration with the fundamental equations of the DSSCs was simulated to analyze the solar-driven CO2 reduction behavior under solar irradiance variations, offering a valuable tool for optimizing operating conditions and predicting the device performance under different environmental conditions. The integrated device successfully produces CO with a faradaic efficiency of 73.85% at a current density of J = 3.35 mA/cm2 under 1 sun illumination, with the result validated and reproduced by the mathematical model. Under reduced illumination conditions of 0.8 and 0.6 suns, faradaic efficiencies of 68.5% and 64.1% were achieved, respectively.</description>

      <title>Lattice Engineering Triggered Phase Formation of Bimetallic Thiospinels with Excellent HzOR and OER Activity for Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Production</title>

                Introducing foreign elements into a crystal lattice could trigger phase transformation, serving as an excellent means to fabricate highly electrocatalytic phases. NiCo2S4 is a notably electrocatalytic thiospinel phase, normally synthesized via two&#8208;step route and rarely explored for electrocatalytic hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). This work reports one&#8208;step hydrothermal syntheses of NiCo2S4 and CuCo2S4 and their performance for HzOR and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Time&#8208;dependent syntheses suggest formation of (M, Co)9S8; M=Ni/Cu phase, followed by conversion to the respective thiospinel phase. Computational study validates that the incorporation of Ni into Co9S8 disrupts its stability and induces the formation of a stable bi&#8208;metallic thiospinel phase. Even without the assistance of metal foam substrate, NiCo2S4 displayed remarkable activity for HzOR requiring potentials of 153 and 350 mV to afford current densities of 10 and 500 mA/cm2, respectively. Furthermore, NiCo2S4 showed good activity for OER, providing 10 mA/cm2 at 290 mV. For hydrazine&#8208;assisted H2 production, the two&#8208;electrode setup, NiCo2S4||Pt/C attained a current density of 10 mA/cm2 at 140 mV, which is 1.39 V less than that required for conventional water electrolyzer (1.53 V). Long&#8208;term durability of NiCo2S4 for both HzOR and OER at high current densities highlights the suitability of the catalyst for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Positive Feedback Mechanism of Stability Degradation of the IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Electrocatalyst Induced by Inferior Catalytic Activity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.energyfuels.4c05299</link>

                Iridium (Ir)-based catalysts embracing both catalytic activity and stability are of great significance for scaling up the application of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Herein, supported IrO2 on TiO2 (IrO2/TiO2) with high specific surface area and electrolytic activity was prepared by adopting a chlorine (Cl)-free synthesis based on the Adams fusion method. The crucial influential factors of annealing temperature were systematically explored on the catalytic activity and stability of IrO2/TiO2. Although increasing annealing temperature is believed to be of benefit to the increase of crystallinity and nanoparticle size in the catalyst, thus improving the stability of the catalyst, the as-prepared catalyst annealed at high temperature exhibited inferior stability at a constant-current density working state. This result is mainly attributed to the adverse impact of the annealing process at high temperatures on the catalytic activity, in terms of decreasing the active surface area due to the aggregation effect and decreasing the intrinsic activity due to the formation of a highly crystalline structure. The inferior catalytic activity caused by the adverse impact can induce a large working voltage, which can accelerate the catalyst degradation via a positive feedback mechanism (PFM) beneath the electrocatalytic system consisting of 'catalytic activity&#8211;electrocatalytic performance (working voltage)&#8211;aging'. Besides, the influences of Cl residue on the catalytic activity and stability of the as-prepared IrO2/TiO2 were also investigated by substituting a Cl-free precursor using IrCl3 (IrO2/TiO2&#8211;Cl). It presented slightly inferior initial oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic performance to that using a Cl-free precursor, perhaps due to the strong adsorption of Cl residue on IrO2 nanoparticles. However, the stability of the as-prepared IrO2/TiO2&#8211;Cl deteriorates significantly in chronopotentiometric measurement probably due to the PFM. Consequently, catalytic activity and stability are of equal significance; both the annealing temperature and Cl residue need to be fine-tuned to achieve an optimal combination of catalytic activity and stability.</description>

      <title>Evolution Path of Nitrogen-Water Cluster Cation: A Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-3nnbx-v2</link>
      <description>Sihan Zhang, Z. Zhu, No host. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406333469

                We applied a highly accurate Density Functional Theory (DFT) method to obtain thermodynamic data for various water-nitrogen clusters. In combination with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and wavefunction analysis, we proposed a theoretical pathway for the evolution of nitrogen-water cation clusters, offering insights into the formation of oxidative environments. Our calculations reveal that nitrogen molecules can form weak bonds with certain hydrogen-oxygen cations, stabilizing key intermediates during hydroxyl radical transfer. Such interaction alters the cluster&#8217;s evolution. Our findings show a clear map of how nitrogen-water cluster cations evolve and give oxidative reactants.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the Hydrothermal Fluids Inferred from the Occurrence and Isotope Characteristics of the Carbonate Minerals at the Pogo Gold Deposit, Alaska, USA</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/min15010067</link>

                Pogo is identified as a deep-seated, intrusion-related gold deposit. Carbonate minerals have a close spatial relationship to hydrothermal gold mineralization in all of its principal ore zones. The carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios of carbonate minerals (siderite, ankerite, and calcite) present within the deposit illustrate the isotopic evolution of the ore-forming fluid. The initial hydrothermal fluid phase is interpreted to be magmatic in origin. The fluid evolution was characterized by a gradual decrease in &#948;18O and a slight increase in &#948;13C with decreasing temperature. The dominant carbon-bearing species was CO2, with methane introduced sporadically. Siderite is associated with early-stage mineralization and occurs with ankerite in main-stage ore assemblages. Calcite is recognized in the later stages of mineralization. Gold in the Pogo deposit occurs as native gold, Au-Bi-Te minerals, inclusions in sulfide minerals, or as &#8220;invisible gold&#8221;. The latter is found in pyrite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, and quartz, based on ion microprobe analysis. The presence of invisible gold in these minerals has significant metallurgical implications for gold processing at the Pogo mine.</description>

      <title>Application of Time Series Analysis on Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations of Hyperthermal Oxidation of Graphite</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.4c07175</link>
      <description>Sharon Edward, Moon&#8208;ki Choi, Harley T. Johnson, The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. None(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406245536

                The oxidation of carbon fiber ablators for thermal protection systems has been extensively studied for atmospheric reentry missions. We investigate this oxidation process at the atomic scale using atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo (A-KMC) simulations, focusing on the influence of two pathways of oxygen adsorption on carbon oxidation: adsorption of oxygen on the basal plane as epoxy groups and adsorption of oxygen directly on the edges of defects. We find that the majority of CO formation results from oxygen adsorbed on the basal plane, which subsequently diffuses toward defect edges. This is due to the greater availability of basal sites relative to defect edges throughout most of the simulation, and the rapid diffusion of epoxy groups toward defect edges at the studied temperatures (1700&#8211;2200 K). In this study, we exploit the temporal data from these A-KMC simulations to investigate the dynamics between the adsorption and CO formation reactions as they evolve with time. From KMC, we obtain time series that represent the time evolution of the frequency of occurrence of these reactions in the model. Pearson's correlation coefficient is used as a metric to identify correlated relationships between time series. By comparing adsorption and CO formation time series using this metric, we find that the contribution of each adsorption reaction toward CO formation varies with time due to the evolving oxidized graphite structure. Specifically, as the ratio of basal plane sites (nbasal) to defect edge sites (nedge) decreases during the simulation, the contribution of basal plane adsorption relative to direct edge adsorption toward CO formation also decreases. We also address several challenges associated with conducting time series analysis in KMC due to the stochastic nature of the method.</description>

                Modern-day applications demand onboard electricity generation that can be achieved using piezoelectric phenomena. Reducing the dimensionality of materials is a pathway to enhancing the piezoelectric properties. Transition-metal dichalcogenides have been shown to exhibit high piezoelectricity. Monolayer MoS2 possesses strong piezoelectricity that is otherwise negligible in its bulk form. The presence of sulfur vacancy defects in two-dimensional MoS2 can starkly reduce piezoelectric output due to enhanced charge screening. Oxygen passivation offers thermodynamically favorable and superior vacancy passivation. Here, we demonstrate an in situ oxygen passivation of sulfur vacancies achieved by performing chemical vapor deposition in atmospheric pressure conditions, resulting in a dramatically enhanced piezoelectric output. We achieved an out-of-plane effective piezoelectric coefficient d33eff 0.54 pm/V for the MoS2 monolayer with sulfur vacancies (SV-MoS2) and 0.94 pm/V where sulfur vacancies are passivated by oxygen (OP-MoS2). The piezoelectric device (PED) based on OP-MoS2 exhibits 26% higher output voltage than SV-MoS2 with the maximum peak-to-peak value of 0.95 V. Additionally, we show that the OP-MoS2-based PED can charge a 330 nF capacitor 30% faster than the SV-MoS2 PED for up to 50 mV in 0.5 s by repetitive finger tapping. The evolution of piezoelectricity in MoS2 with sulfur vacancy defect manipulation promises an avenue for scalable defect engineering for next-generation applications in miniaturized self-powered electronics and sensors across computing, healthcare, and size-, weight-, and power-constrained environments.</description>

                Abstract The stability of perovskite quantum dot solar cells is one of the key challenges of this technology. This study reveals the unique degradation behavior of cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI 3 ) quantum dot solar cells. For the first time, it is shown that the oxygen&#8208;induced degradation and performance loss of CsPbI 3 quantum dot photovoltaic devices can be reversed by exposing the degraded samples to humidity, allowing the performance to recover and even surpass the initial performance. By careful characterization and analysis throughout the degradation and recovery process, the underlying physical and chemical mechanisms that govern the evolution of the device performance could be identified. It is shown that the ligand shell of the quantum dots, rather than the instability of the semiconducting material itself, is the driving factor in these mechanisms. This highlights the important role of surface chemistry and ligand design in enhancing perovskite quantum dot photovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Water or dry land &#8722; that is not a question for amphibious plant species</title>

                Amphibious plants attract much attention due to their unique ability to live in aquatic and terrestrial environments and sustain abrupt changes of water regime in the habitat. They may colonise habitats with pronounced water level fluctuations and water /dry land interface areas. Water and air differ in many aspects, like density, buoyancy, light and thermal conditions, as well as humidity and diffusion of gases, including oxygen and carbon dioxide, that all affect plant growth and development. The evolution of amphibious plant species resulted in high phenotypic plasticity that is manifested as a variety of ecophenes performing optimally in contrasting conditions. The most important adaptations are heterophylly and/or different life forms that differ at morphological, anatomical, biochemical, and physiological levels. These adaptations comprise the wide span of traits that are found in submerged and terrestrial plant species. The plasticity of amphibious plant species offers a potential to colonise water bodies where hydrology is affected by climate changes and present a unique model system where different scientific aspects of plants may be studied in genetically identical specimens.</description>

      <title>Polythiophene-Based Nonmetal Electrocatalyst with Biocompatibility to Boost Efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Conversion</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/cbe.4c00156</link>

                In a hybrid microbial&#8211;inorganic catalysis system, H2 evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts are coupled with microorganisms to achieve the highly efficient conversion of CO2 to value-added chemicals using H2 as an electron mediator. However, currently developed HER electrocatalysts suffer from poor biocompatibility, hindering the performance of the system. This study presents a N- and Si-doped polythiophene nanocomposite (PTh-NSi) as a nonmetal HER electrocatalyst with biocompatibility for use in a hybrid microbial&#8211;inorganic catalysis system. By coupling PTh-NSi with Ralstonia eutropha H16, conversion of CO2 to poly-&#946;-hydroxybutyrate with a maximum yield of 662.99 &#177; 27.46 mg/L was achieved. The PTh-NSi electrocatalyst demonstrated HER performance in bacterial media, minimal reactive oxygen species production, and no heavy metal ion leaching, ensuring biocompatibility with R. eutropha H16. The interactions between PTh-NSi and R. eutropha H16 were revealed. This work highlights an approach to designing biocompatible catalysts for hybrid microbial&#8211;inorganic catalysis systems, offering the potential for sustainable CO2 conversion.</description>

      <title>C/O ratios in self-gravitating protoplanetary discs with dust evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1017/pasa.2024.126</link>
      <description>Tamara Molyarova, E. I. Vorobyov, Vitaly Akimkin, Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia. 42(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406187615

                Abstract Elemental abundances, particularly the C/O ratio, are seen as a way to connect the composition of planetary atmospheres with planet formation scenario and the disc chemical environment. We model the chemical composition of gas and ices in a self-gravitating disc on timescales of 0.5 Myr since its formation to study the evolution of C/O ratio due to dust dynamics and growth and phase transitions of the volatile species. We use the thin-disc hydrodynamic code FEOSAD, which includes disc self-gravity, thermal balance, dust evolution, and turbulent diffusion, and treats dust as a dynamically different and evolving component interacting with the gas. It also describes freeze-out, sublimation, and advection of four most abundant volatile species: H $_2$ O, CO $_2$ , CH $_4$ , and CO. We demonstrate the effect of gas and dust substructures such as spirals and rings on the distribution of volatiles and C/O ratios, including the formation of multiple snowlines of one species, and point out the anticorrelation between dust-to-gas ratio and total C/O ratio emerging due to the contribution of oxygen-rich ice mantles. We identify time and spatial locations where two distinct trigger mechanisms for planet formation are operating and differentiate them by C/O ratio range: wide range of the C/O ratios of $0-1.4$ for streaming instability, and a much narrower range $0.3-0.6$ for gravitational instability (with the initial value of 0.34). This conclusion is corroborated by observations, showing that transiting exoplanets, which possibly experienced migration through a variety of disc conditions, have significantly larger spread of C/O in comparison with directly imaged exoplanets likely formed in gravitationally unstable outer disk regions. We show that the ice-phase $\textrm{C/O}\approx$ 0.2&#8211;0.3 between the CO, CO $_2$ , and CH $_4$ snowlines corresponds to the composition of the Solar system comets, that represent primordial planetesimals.</description>

      <title>Dressed Up to the Nines: The Interplay of Phytohormones Signaling and Redox Metabolism During Plant Response to Drought</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/plants14020208</link>
      <description>Douglas Jardim&#8208;Messeder, Ygor de Souza-Vieira, Gilberto Sachetto&#8208;Martins, Plants. 14(2)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406307964

                Plants must effectively respond to various environmental stimuli to achieve optimal growth. This is especially relevant in the context of climate change, where drought emerges as a major factor globally impacting crops and limiting overall yield potential. Throughout evolution, plants have developed adaptative strategies for environmental stimuli, with plant hormones and reactive oxygen species (ROS) playing essential roles in their development. Hormonal signaling and the maintenance of ROS homeostasis are interconnected, playing indispensable roles in growth, development, and stress responses and orchestrating diverse molecular responses during environmental adversities. Nine principal classes of phytohormones have been categorized: auxins, brassinosteroids, cytokinins, and gibberellins primarily oversee developmental growth regulation, while abscisic acid, ethylene, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and strigolactones are the main orchestrators of environmental stress responses. Coordination between phytohormones and transcriptional regulation is crucial for effective plant responses, especially in drought stress. Understanding the interplay of ROS and phytohormones is pivotal for elucidating the molecular mechanisms involved in plant stress responses. This review provides an overview of the intricate relationship between ROS, redox metabolism, and the nine different phytohormones signaling in plants, shedding light on potential strategies for enhancing drought tolerance for sustainable crop production.</description>

      <title>Guidelines for Accurate and Precise Stable Isotope Analysis of Calcite, Dolomite, and Magnesite Using a Carbonate Device for Continuous Flow&#8208;Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry (CF&#8208;IRMS)</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/rcm.9958</link>

                ABSTRACT Rationale Carbonate minerals are one of the most popular samples for an automated sample preparation system for CF&#8208;IRMS, such as GasBench II and iso FLOW, but no standardized analytical protocols exist. This study gives guidelines on optimal analytic conditions for carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of Ca&#8211;Mg carbonates when using the carbonate&#8211;phosphoric acid reaction method. Methods Calcite (CaCO 3 &#8211;McMaster Carrara), dolomite (CaMg(CO 3 ) 2 &#8211;MRSI Dolomite), and magnesite (MgCO 3 &#8211;ROM Brazil Magnesite) with two grain size fractions (&lt; 74 and 149&#8211;250 &#956;m) were reacted with 103% (specific gravity of 1.92) phosphoric acid under He atmosphere in 12&#8208;mL borosilicate glass vials to examine the full &#948; 13 C and &#948; 18 O evolution of acid&#8208;liberated CO 2 for an extended reaction time of up to 12&#8211;30 days at 25&#176;C and up to 3&#8211;7 days at 72&#176;C. Results At 25&#176;C, the optimal reaction time of calcite is 1 day for both grain size fractions while the optimal reaction time of 2&#8211;10 day is suggested for dolomite with a grain size of &lt; 74 &#956;m. At 72&#176;C, 30&#8208;min to 12&#8208;h or 45&#8208;min to 12&#8208;h reaction is optimal for calcite with &lt; 74&#8208;&#956;m or 149&#8208; to 250&#8208;&#956;m grain size fraction, respectively, whereas dolomite requires 12&#8208;h to 1&#8208;day reaction for both grain size fractions. The only optimal condition for magnesite is 6&#8211;7 days of reaction with &lt; 74&#8208;&#956;m grain size at 72&#176;C. Conclusions To determine precise and accurate &#948; 13 C and &#948; 18 O values of a carbonate mineral using the carbonate&#8211;phosphoric acid reaction method, an optimal reaction time must be assessed for a given analytical condition to avoid nonequilibrium isotope effects and unnecessary oxygen isotope exchange of acid&#8208;liberated CO 2 in the carbonate reaction vessel. Our experimental result provides a guideline for the accurate and precise stable isotope analysis of Ca&#8211;Mg carbonate minerals.</description>

                Abstract The Systemic Evolutionary Theory of the Origin of Cancer (SETOC) is a recently proposed theory founded on two primary principles: the cooperative and endosymbiotic process of cell evolution as described by Lynn Margulis, and the integration of complex systems operating in eukaryotic cells, which is a core concept in systems biology. The SETOC proposes that malignant transformation occurs when cells undergo a continuous adaptation process in response to long-term injuries, leading to tissue remodeling, chronic inflammation, fibrosis, and ultimately cancer. This process involves a maladaptive response, wherein the 'endosymbiotic contract&#8217; between the nuclear-cytoplasmic system (derived from the primordial archaeal cell) and the mitochondrial system (derived from the primordial &#945;-proteobacterium) gradually breaks down. This ultimately leads to uncoordinated behaviors and functions in transformed cells. The decoupling of the two cellular subsystems causes transformed cells to acquire phenotypic characteristics analogous to those of unicellular organisms, as well as certain biological features of embryonic development that are normally suppressed. These adaptive changes enable cancer cells to survive in the harsh tumor microenvironment characterized by low oxygen concentrations, inadequate nutrients, increased catabolic waste, and increased acidity. De-endosymbiosis reprograms the sequential metabolic functions of glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). This leads to increased lactate fermentation (Warburg effect), respiratory chain dysfunction, and TCA cycle reversal. Here, we present an updated version of the SETOC that incorporates the fundamental principles outlined by this theory and integrates the epistemological approach used to develop it.</description>

                Abstract Background Use of remote measurement of physiological parameters using digital biometrics (i.e., Electro Dermal Activities, heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood volume pulse, etc.) has a multitude of opportunities in rural contexts that have not yet fully been explored in Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) clinical research. This study assessed feasibility and acceptability of advanced digital biometric data collection among rural, community&#8208;dwelling adults living with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease with support from primary caregivers (dyad). Methods Initial feasibility and acceptability of a wrist&#8208;worn wearable device (Empatica E4) as means for digital biometric data collection were assessed among participants of a larger randomized controlled trial which was aimed to assess a non&#8208;pharmacological care intervention improving behavioral symptoms of AD. Following consent, dyads were mailed an E4 device and behavior tracking journal to companion digital recordings for one week of data collection. Caregivers assisted the person with AD in wear and care of the E4 device and completed time&#8208;stamped behavior tracking. Feasibility was assessed based on completeness of digital biometric data recordings and acceptability was determined based on wear schedules for the device in participants with AD (worn &gt;50% of allotted time). Results Digital biometric data collection via remote, wearable devices is feasible and acceptable among participants with AD in rural settings among 16 dyads (person with AD age x&#772;=77&#177;2.4 years, 10 female; caregiver age years x&#772;=57&#177;2.9 years, 8 female). The E4 correctly captured biometric signals (Electro Dermal Activities, blood volume pulse, Skin Temperature, etc.). The device was acceptable as 14 of the 16 participants with AD wore the device &gt;50% of allotted time with proper completion of the caregiver&#8208;reported behavior tracking. Further, we observed that unsupervised machine learning models were able to create digital biometrics that mirrored caregivers&#8217; notes. Conclusion Advances in technology, evolution of health status surveillance, and vast needs in rural areas create an ideal scenario to advance research in digital biometrics. With goals to use digital biometrics as primary outcome measures in AD clinical trials, the findings presented here illustrate feasibility and acceptability among geographically remote communities. Additional research is needed to assess context&#8208;aware machine learning applicability in intervention&#8208;based clinical research.</description>

      <title>Editorial: Micro and nanoparticles for regenerative medicine</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2024.1548963</link>
      <description>Aurore Van de Walle, Yang Zhang, Alessandro Polini, Riccardo Di Corato, Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology. 12(None)] 2025. https://openalex.org/W4406346650

                The synthesis of micro-and nano-particles must be precisely controlled to achieve the desired shape and composition, as these characteristics profoundly influence their applicative efficacy. A large body of literature aims at constantly improving structure/function of these materials by refining synthesis procedures. Within it, a growing field of chemistry focuses on green synthesis methods to provide more sustainable alternatives while maintaining the bioactive efficiency of the particles. For instance, this Research Topic features a study on magnesium oxide (MgO) nanoparticles synthesized using Azadirachta indica (neem) extract (Al-Harbi et al., 2024). The produced MgO nanoparticles exhibit remarkable stability under heat and in biological media, alongside notable antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties. Aligned with this search for greener processes and materials, another featured study reviews the development of silk fibroin-based scaffolds for tissue engineering (Ma et al., 2024). Silk, biosynthesized by over 200,000 arthropod species -including the Bombyx mori moth, whose silk is the most characterized -offers a rich source of fibroin, a natural biopolymer. Silk fibroin stands out for its mechanical strength, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and structural tunability. It can be used alone or combined with other materials to enhance cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation.A focus in regenerative medicine consists in creating tissue alternatives to repair aging or diseased tissues and organs. It generally relies on the use of a scaffold for cell support. These scaffolds must meet precise guidelines to provide appropriate biomechanical and biochemical cues to facilitate cell adhesion and regulate phenotypic expression. Their conception thus requires control over shape, mechanical properties, and surface characteristics. The previously mentioned review on silk fibroin details the numerous possible processing techniques of this biomaterial (i.e. electrospinning, freeze-drying, solvent casting, gas foaming, particulate leaching, 3D printing) making it versatile and relevant for the repair of various tissues, including skin, bone, cartilage, blood vessel, and nerves (Ma et al., 2024). Nano-and micro-structuration of scaffolds is another approach to enhance scaffold features as explored in this research topic in a study that showcases the incorporation of graphene oxide to the pure hardystonite (used for bone repair) leading to the obtention of a porous nano-and microstructured hardystonite/reduced graphene oxide composite (Bagherpour et al., 2023). The produced biomaterial demonstrates enhanced osteogenic differentiation and mechanical strength. An additional study focuses on the nanoscale properties of biphasic calcium phosphate (BCP), also employed in bone repair (Su et al., 2023). Granular-shaped BCP nanoparticles were synthesized, and the nanoscale texturing of these materials enhanced biocompatibility and osteogenic features. Importantly, they demonstrated immunomodulatory effects by reducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in macrophages, even under lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory conditions. The ability of BCP nanoparticles to restore osteogenesis impaired by inflammation underscores their dual role in promoting bone regeneration and modulating the immune response.Nanometer-scaled materials can provide stronger antibacterial features. The silver-copper bimetallic nanoparticles featured in this issue exemplify this strategy (Hao et al., 2024). Silver and copper nanoparticles have superior antibacterial effects compared to their bulk or micron-size counterparts. Furthermore, combining these nanomaterials rather than using them individually amplifies their antibacterial efficacy while minimizing cytotoxicity. These nanoparticles have dynamic interactions in biological environments through metal ions release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which collectively boost localized antibacterial activity, minimizing systemic side effects (Hao et al., 2024).Bioinspired MgO NPs also exhibited targeted effects. They show selective cytotoxicity against liver hepatic cancer cells in comparison to human umbilical vein endothelial ones, encouraging their potential in anticancer therapies (Al-Harbi et al., 2024). Additionally, they demonstrate significant antidiabetic activity through the inhibition of key enzymes like &#945;glucosidase and &#945;-amylase, along with robust anti-inflammatory effects via protein stabilization and cytokine regulation. Antioxidant activity is another critical aspect of bioactive particles. By scavenging free radicals, MgO NPs protect tissues from oxidative stress, a major contributor to inflammation and chronic diseases.Similarly, BCP nanomaterials have shown remarkable bioactivity. They mitigate inflammation in macrophages and enhance osteogenic processes by increasing alkaline phosphatase activity and upregulating osteogenesis-related genes, such as Runx2 and OPN (Su et al., 2023). Notably, BCP nanoparticles can reverse the detrimental effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory conditions on osteoblast activity. This dual functionality makes BCP nanoparticles promising candidates for applications in environments where inflammation impedes bone regeneration.The integration of micro-and nano-particles into regenerative medicine can not only support tissue regeneration but also actively engage in therapeutic processes. While these versatile biomaterials hold large promises, challenges still remain for their widespread adoption in the clinic. Among them, the assessment of long-term biocompatibility requires monitoring biomaterial evolution over years. It is a complex task, yet necessary, as these materials are designed to interact with biological systems over extended periods. Another challenge concerns their integration with advanced manufacturing, such as 3D printing, as well as the scalability and reproducibility of their manufacturing. This is necessary to ensure consistent production of high-quality particles for large-scale applications. In parallel to these technical hurdles come regulatory and translational barriers. However, as this field progresses and with sustained efforts to overcome these obstacles, we are optimistic that micro-and nanoparticles can pave the way for more effective medical solutions.</description>

                Metastatic hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2&#8722;) breast cancer often develops resistance to first-line treatment, typically combining cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) with hormone therapy (HT) [1, 2]. After an initial response, most patients become resistant, and compensatory mechanisms are not fully uncovered [3]. To address this, we analyzed HR+ resistant CAMA1 and 747D cells using whole-exome and RNA sequencing, supplemented by proteomics and target validation with human samples. Additionally, we conducted combination therapy trials using xenografts and patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Detailed study designs and methods are provided in the Supplementary file. In a cohort of 27 patients with metastatic breast cancer, we observed reduced progression-free survival in second- and third-line therapies following progression post palbociclib-HT treatment (Supplementary Figure S1A and Supplementary Table S1). Resistant tumors showed reduced estrogen receptor alpha (ER&#945;) and progesterone receptor (PR) and increased proliferation rates (Supplementary Figure S1B-D). CAMA1 and T47D cells, treated with palbociclib and fulvestrant (PF) for 2 years, developed resistance (CAMA1-PFR and T47D-PFR) confirmed by proliferation assays and elevated half-maximal inhibitory concentrations. Resistant cells exhibited reduced levels of ER&#945; and retinoblastoma protein (Supplementary Figure S2). Exome analysis revealed no drug resistance-related mutations (Supplementary Tables S2-S3), suggesting non-genetic factors. RNA sequencing of T47D cells treated with DMSO or PF for 20 days and T47D-PFR cells revealed 1,172 upregulated genes and 824 downregulated genes in the resistant cells (Supplementary Figure S3A). Gene set enrichment analysis indicated increased fatty acid localization (Supplementary Figure S3B), with a heatmap showing elevated fatty acid uptake and metabolism-related genes, such as fatty acid binding protein-6 (FABP6), FABP7, cluster of differentiation-36 (CD36), and proteasome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR&#947;) in T47D-PFR cells (Figure 1A). Lipid droplets accumulated in PF-treated parental and PF-resistant T47D and CAMA1 cells (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S3C). FABP6 levels were elevated in PF-treated parental and PF-resistant cells, with CD36 overexpression unique to T47D-PFR cells at both protein and mRNA levels (Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S3D-E), suggesting that lipid uptake might be an adaptive response to oxidative stress [4, 5]. This was supported by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in PF-treated parental cells (Figure 1D). Furthermore, proteomic analysis in human biopsies revealed a functional network of 11 oxidative stress-triggered proteasomes (Supplementary Figure S4A and Supplementary Tables S4-S5) as indicators of oxidative stress [6]. Immunohistochemistry validated increased proteasome subunit alpha type-7 (PSMA7) in resistant biopsies (Supplementary Figure S4B). Ferroptosis inducers overcome resistance of HR+HER2&#8722; breast cancer cells to palbociclib-hormone therapy. (A) Heatmap of upregulated genes (red) or downregulated genes (blue) during the treatment of T47D cells with PF combination for 20 days, and in PF-resistant cells (T47D-PFR) after continuous PF treatment for 2 years, compared to parental T47D cells treated with vehicle (DMSO). All represented genes had a P value &lt; 0.05. (B) Lipid droplet detection by BODIPY 493/503 staining in parental CAMA1 and T47D cells after treatment with the PF combination for 20 days, and in CAMA1-PFR and T47D-PFR cells after continuous PF treatment for 2 years. DAPI staining was used to visualize the nuclei. (C) Western blot analysis of FABP6 and CD36 in parental CAMA1 and T47D cells after treatment with the PF combination for 20 days, and in CAMA1-PFR and T47D-PFR cells after continuous PF treatment for 2 years. (D) Measurement of ROS levels by DCFDA ROS assay in parental CAMA1 and T47D cells and in CAMA1-PFR and T47D-PFR cells treated for 5 days with DMSO or PF. Continuous PF treatment for resistant cells was discontinued 3 days prior to the assay. (E) Western blot analysis of GPX4 in parental CAMA1, T47D and ZR75.1 cells after treatment with PF combination for 20 days and in CAMA1-PFR, T47D-PFR and ZR75.1-PFR cells after continuous PF treatment for 2 years. (F) Immunohistochemistry analysis (images) and quantification (bar chart) of GPX4-positive cells in biopsies of patients taken before treatment with palbociclib-HT or after resistance (*P &lt; 0.05). (G) Assessment of cell proliferation according to the fold change in confluence in parental and PF-resistant CAMA1 and T47D cells treated with DMSO, the ferroptosis inducer RSL3 (1 &#181;mol/L), the ferroptosis inhibitor Trolox (10 &#181;mol/L), or a combination of both for 7 days. Continuous PF treatment for resistant cells was discontinued 3 days prior to the assay. (H) Assessment of cell proliferation according to the fold change in confluence in parental and PF-resistant CAMA1 and T47D cells treated with different combinations of DMSO, palbociclib (P) (0.3 &#181;mol/L), fulvestrant (F) (30 nmol/L), or eprenetapopt (Ep) (25 &#181;mol/L) for 7 days. Continuous PF treatment for resistant cells was discontinued 3 days prior to the assay. (I, J) Tumor growth curves of parental CAMA1 (6 mice per group) (I) and CAMA1-PFR (8 mice per group) (J) xenografts treated with different combinations of palbociclib (P) 75 mg/kg daily, fulvestrant (F) 50 mg/kg once a week, and eprenetapopt (Ep) 150 mg/kg, 2 times/day or RSL3 100 mg/kg by intratumoral injection every two days for two weeks (***P &lt; 0.001). (K) Growth curves of palbociclib-HT-na&#239;ve HBCx-124 PDXs (5 mice per group) treated with different combinations of palbociclib (P) 75 mg/kg daily, fulvestrant (F) 50 mg/kg once a week, and eprenetapopt (Ep) 150 mg/kg, 2 times/day (***P &lt; 0.001). (L) Growth curves of palbociclib-HT-resistant HBCx-180 PDXs (8 mice per group) treated with different combinations of palbociclib (P) 75 mg/kg daily, fulvestrant (F) 50 mg/kg once a week, and eprenetapopt (Ep) 150 mg/kg, 2 times/day. The difference between the measured tumor volumes was significant between the "vehicle" group and the eprenetapopt + fulvestrant + palbociclib (FPE) group from Day 25 until the end of the experiment (P &lt; 0.05). Tumor evolution formula is (Vf &#8722; V0 / V0) &#215; 100%, where V0 is the initial volume and Vf is the final volume measured at each time point.

We investigated whether cell survival is affected by ferroptosis&#8212;a type of non-apoptotic cell death linked to lipid peroxidation. GPX4 protein, the main protector against ferroptosis, was overexpressed in parental cells after PF treatment and in PF-resistant cells, even after drug wash-out, with no changes in mRNA levels (Figure 1E and Supplementary Figure S5A-C). Silencing GPX4 expression reduced cell proliferation in parental and PF-resistant cells (Supplementary Figure S5D-F), indicating their reliance on GPX4. GPX4 overexpression was also observed in resistant human tumors (Figure 1F). Cells were treated with the GPX4 inhibitor RAS-selective lethal 3 (RSL3) and the antioxidant Trolox for 6 days. CAMA1 and T47D cells were insensitive to RSL3, whereas CAMA1-PFR and T47D-PFR cells showed high sensitivity to RSL3 (Figure 1G). Trolox reversed RSL3's effect in both cell lines (Figure 1G), highlighting the role of GPX4 in PF-resistant cell proliferation. Due to unverified safety of RLS3, we used eprenetapopt (Ep), a p53 activator and GSH depletory [7] proven safe in hematological cancer patients [8]. In vitro, CAMA1 and CAMA1-PFR cells were sensitive to Ep, while T47D cells were insensitive; T47D-PFR showed higher sensitivity (Figure 1H). To investigate the effect of pharmacologically induced ferroptosis on the palbociclib-fulvestrant response in vivo, we used nude mice implanted with estrogen pellets. Due to its low pharmacokinetics in mouse plasma [9], RSL3 was administered via intratumoral injection. Mice were treated with vehicle, PF, Ep, RSL3, a combination of palbociclib-fulvestrant and eprenetapopt (PFEp), or a combination of palbociclib-fulvestrant and RSL3 (PF-RSL3). PF effectively inhibited the growth of the CAMA1 xenografts, while CAMA1-PFR tumors were insensitive (Figure 1I and J). RSL3 alone did not affect CAMA1-PFR tumor growth, whereas PF-RSL3 demonstrated a strong antitumor effect (Figure 1J), suggesting that RSL3 sensitizes CAMA1-PFR cells to PF, or vice versa. Similarly, Ep alone did not inhibit CAMA1-PFR tumor growth, but its combination with PF completely abolished tumor growth (Figure 1J). To evaluate treatment effects on proliferation and cell death, we assessed Ki67, caspase-3 and hydroxynonenal (HNE) in tumors by immunohistochemistry. Parental CAMA1 tumors treated with PF showed a significant decrease in Ki67, with no effect on caspase-3, while CAMA1-PFR tumors exhibited no significant changes in either marker after treatment with PF, PFEp, or PF-RSL3 (Supplementary Figure S6A-D). HNE labeling revealed no difference between PF- and vehicle-treated CAMA1 tumors (Supplementary Figure S6E), but HNE increased moderately in CAMA1-PFR tumors treated with RSL3 and significantly with PFEp or PF-RSL3 (Supplementary Figure S6F), indicating potential cell death by ferroptosis. No treatments affected CD36 expression in either tumor type, although CAMA1-PFR xenografts showed significantly increased basal expression compared to human biopsies (Supplementary Figure S6G-J). To strengthen the translational impact of our findings, we used patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) from HR+HER2&#8722; breast cancer patients without p53 mutations (Supplementary Figure S7A) [10]. Consistent with human samples, GPX4 protein was upregulated in the palbociclib-HT-resistant PDX model (HBCx-180) compared to the palbociclib-HT-na&#239;ve PDX model (HBCx-124) (Supplementary Figure S7B). While GPX4 mRNA levels were unaffected in resistant cells, its expression was significantly higher in HBCx-180 (Supplementary Figure S7C), suggesting specific transcriptional/translational regulation differing between in vitro and in vivo contexts. In the HBCx-124 model, all the tumors (n = 5) responded well to PF, with no added benefit from Ep (PFEp), although a partial response to Ep monotherapy was observed (Figure 1K). Conversely, the HBCx-180 model showed no significant response to PF or Ep, with significant differences in tumor volumes between PFEp and vehicle and Ep groups from Day 25 onward (P &lt; 0.05) (Figure 1L). These results confirm that adding Ep to PF in PF-resistant tumors produces a strong antitumor effect. Ki67 labeling decreased with PF in the HBCx-124 PDX but not in the HBCx-180 PDX (Supplementary Figure S8A-B). Aside from reduction in caspase-3 labeling in the HBCx-124 treated with PF, no significant changes were observed with Ep or PFEp, and none of the treatment conditions affected HBCx-180 (Supplementary Figure S8C-D), indicating that proliferation and apoptosis are not affected in HBCx-180. HNE labeling suggested that PF promoted ferroptosis in HBCx-124, while only tumors treated with PFEp in HBCx-180 exhibited significant HNE increase compared to vehicle (Supplementary Figure S8E-F). PF slightly increased HNE in HBCx-124 without significance but the only vulnerability of HBCx-180 is attributed to ferroptosis induced with PFEp. The p53-dependent antitumor effect of eprenetapopt was excluded, as p53 expression was similar in parental and PF-resistant cells and in PDXs, while slightly elevated in resistant human tumors (Supplementary Figure S9). Finally, the addition of Ep or RSL3 to PF did not induce significant renal, hepatic, or hematological toxicity in mice (Supplementary Figure S10). In conclusion, HR+HER2&#8722; tumors resistant to palbociclib-HT are vulnerable to ferroptosis inducers, highlighting the potential of collateral drug sensitivity and the promise of developing pro-ferroptosis agents for treating drug-resistant metastatic breast cancer (Supplementary Figure S11).

PDX experiments were performed at the Institute of Curie, in accordance with institutional guidelines and the rules of the French Ethics Committee (project authorization no. 02163.02).
