      <title>Influence of a Tiny Quantity of Ir in Ruir Binary Oxide for Oxygen Evolution Reaction Using the Model Electrode Method</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02674692mtgabs</link>
      <description>Mayu Negishi, Akichika Banno, Takahiro Maruyama, Takahiro Saida, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-02(67)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405639573

                Polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is one method for mass hydrogen production. However, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) of the PEMWE anode has a high overpotential, which is the main factor in increasing electricity requirements. Therefore, it is desired to decrease the overpotential of OER. RuO 2 is known as the most active OER catalyst, but its stability in the high-potential regions is poor. For this reason, IrO 2 , with relatively high stability, is generally used as the anode catalyst despite its OER activity being lower than that of RuO 2 . The most significant problem with the IrO 2 catalyst is its cost, which is attributed to the rarest element. There are many reports about the Ir-Ru binary oxide catalyst proposed to improve stability in RuO 2 and increase OER activity in IrO 2 . Their Ir/Ru ratio is generally about one, and the Ir content should be reduced as much as possible to suppress the cost. Recently, it was reported that the combination of only 6% of Ir with a Ru catalyst demonstrated high OER activity and stability [1]. The other research groups haven&#8217;t followed the low rate of Ir in the Ir-Ru binary catalyst, although it is very advantageous in terms of commercialization. Therefore, it is hard to judge the true effect of a tiny quantity of Ir to OER activity and stability in Ru-based catalysts. In the practical catalyst, many factors, such as the diffusivity of the O 2 bubble, proton and electron conductivities, and so on, influence the OER activity. Herein, we employed the model electrode method to investigate the essential effect of a small number of Ir for the OER activity of the Ru-based catalyst. The model electrode doesn&#8217;t have to consider proton and electron conductivity and O 2 bubble diffusivity. Therefore, it can focus on the difference in electron structure, OER activity, and stability in the model electrode with several Ir content rates. In this study, the additive effect of a tiny quantity of Ir on the Ru-based model electrodes on OER activity and stability was investigated. The model electrode was composed of a glassy carbon substrate, the Ru nanosheet stacking layer of about 1 &#8211; 3 nm, and a few nanometer-sized Ir nanoparticles at the top layer. The amount of the Ir on a model electrode was controlled by a number of pulses in the arc plasma deposition method. The electrochemical measurements were conducted by a three-electrode cell, which is composed of a working electrode, a carbon counter electrode, a reversible hydrogen electrode, and 0.1 M HClO 4 (room temp.). All of the model electrodes were subjected to electrooxidation by potential sweeping before their OER activity and stability were evaluated. Furthermore, before and after the electrochemical measurements, the electron structure of the model electrodes was confirmed by XPS analysis. All model electrodes showed redox peaks at around 0.6 V and 1.0 V, which are attributed to RuO 2 and IrO 2 , respectively. Adding a tiny quantity of Ir seemed to improve the OER activity. In contrast, the stability of RuO 2 depended on the amount of Ir. Surprisingly, the dissolution rate of Ru increased with the increase of Ir contents in the model electrode. These results suggested the possibility that a few amounts of Ir contents in RuO 2 could improve the OER activity but have a negative effect on its stability. [1] D.

      <title>Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity of Highly Crystalline Hydrated Cobalt Oxyhydroxide Synthesized with Soft Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02583899mtgabs</link>

                Introduction Zinc-air secondary batteries are expected to have high energy density because oxygen in ambient air can be used as the active material. They are also expected to satisfy high safety standards owing to the aqueous electrolyte solutions and open structure. In addition, low cost is expected since zinc is a relatively cheap metal compared to lithium. Because of these features, Zinc-air secondary batteries are attracting attention as a next-generation large-scale energy storage device. One of the challenges for commercializing this battery system is the low energy conversion efficiency caused by the large overvoltage of the air electrode. To solve this problem, oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts have been intensively researched, and Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3-&#948; (BSCF) and Ca 2 FeCoO 5 (CFCO) have been developed as OER catalysts having higher activity than conventional noble metal oxide catalysts. Since the active sites of BSCF and CFCO are reported as partially Fe-substituted CoOOH phases 1,2 , it is essential to understand OER characteristics of partially Fe-substituted CoOOH phases. However, the effects of the crystallinity and Fe-substitution ratio on OER activity have not been clarified. This is mainly because metastable hydrated CoOOH is conventionally synthesized at relatively low temperatures. On the other hand, we have successfully synthesized highly crystalline hydrated Ni x Fe 1&#8211;x OOH using soft chemistry and clarified the effect of crystallinity and Fe-substitution ratio on the OER activity 3 . In this study, we synthesized highly crystalline hydrated CoOOH using soft chemistry and evaluate its OER activity to elucidate factors controlling it. Experimental Hydrated CoOOH was synthesized with two-step soft chemistry following the report by Sakurai et al. 4 . First, Na 0.74 CoO 2 was obtained by calcination of Co 3 O 4 :Na 2 CO 3 =40:60 mol% at 900 &#176;C for 12 h. Then, synthesized Na 0.74 CoO 2 was stirred in 7.8 mmol dm &#8211;3 Br 2 / CH 3 CN to obtain Na 0.358 CoO 2 by extracting Na. Finally, Na 0.358 CoO 2 was hydrated by refluxing with ultra-pure water at 100 &#176;C for 24 h. The synthesized samples were characterized with powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Results and discussion Figure 1 shows a XRD pattern of the synthesized sample. Though relatively broad unidentified peak is observed at around 8 &#176;, the diffraction pattern of hydrated CoOOH is observed as a main phase. Its OER performance in an aqueous solution of KOH will be presented at the site. References 1) K. J. May, C. E. Carlton, K. A. Stoerzinger, M. Risch, J. Suntivich, Y. L. Lee, A. Grimaud, Y. S.

      <title>Shedding Light on Active Site Reconstruction and Structural Transformation of Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysts for Water Electrolysis</title>

                Designing efficient and stable electrolcatalysts for the demanding oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in water electrolysis is challenging and we are still lacking fundamental understanding of the underlying processes related to catalyst transformations governing their final activity and stability. Only the combination of operando spectroscopy techniques with electrochemical measurements can promote a deeper understanding on the interplay of different phenomena taking place during OER [1]. In this work, we utilize operando techniques like X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) and Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) [2], in combination with specifically designed electrochemical protocols to study i) the reconstruction/reactivation of active sites in Ir-based OER catalysts for acidic media (Fig. 1a-c) and Ni-based OER catalysts for alkaline media (Fig. 1d) and ii) the identification of the relevant OER active species which will eventually define the final electrocatalyst performance [3]. We show not only the formation of the active species for OER but also the dynamic operando transformation of the Ir- and Ni-based electrocatalysts before the onset of OER but also their structural transformation due to electro-oxidation during OER, processes that lead to the final active phase. The underlying mechanisms studied via our operando analysis provide fundamental understanding of reaction mechanism but also guidance for the design of efficient OER catalysts optimized for their operation in technical devices.

                Particulate photoelectrocatalysts (PEC) have attracted substantial attention due to their potential for renewable fuel generation from sunlight and water. The characterization of reactivity at the active sites of photocatalysts with nanometer-scale spatial resolution is essential for understanding and developing more efficient energy conversion systems. In this study, we present the results of the first single-particle-on-microelectrode oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity measurements assisted by in situ photoelectrochemical scanning electrochemical microscopy (photo-SECM). An individual micrometer-sized Al-doped SrTiO 3 /Rh 2&#8211;y Cr y O 3 photocatalyst crystal was immobilized on a carbon fiber microelectrode and probed using a Pt nanoelectrode at various substrate bias conditions to promote OER and HER. Local fluxes of oxygen and hydrogen generated by an individual PEC microcrystal were quantitatively evaluated with COMSOL Multiphysics finite-element simulations.</description>

      <title>(Invited) Light-Guided Electrodeposition for Functional Integration of Catalyst Pattern on Semiconductor for Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02594025mtgabs</link>
      <description>Suyeon Lee, Ha&#8208;Ni Im, Nayeon Lee, Sung Yul Lim, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-02(59)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405639635

                Photoelectrochemical cells (PECs) for water splitting typically rely on catalysts deposited on the semiconductor due to its lack of intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. However, the placement of catalysts within the light path between the source and semiconductor in artificial leaf-based architectures can hinder the semiconductor's light absorption, diminishing photoelectrochemical activity, especially at high catalyst loading. To address this challenge, we propose a strategy involving the controlled formation of patterned catalysts on the semiconductor surface. This approach, utilizing light-guided electrodeposition facilitated by a digital micromirror device (DMD), enables the direct, localized deposition of transition metal-based catalysts. The resulting patterned catalysts correspond to the light pattern, allowing for optimized photoelectrochemical performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy on a hematite (&#945;-Fe 2 O 3 )-based photoanode, achieving enhanced performance with grid-patterned CoPi catalysts. This approach not only facilitates high catalyst loading but also ensures sufficient light penetration through the exposed intrinsic surface of &#945;-Fe 2 O 3 . Our findings suggest that this technique holds promise for advancing the commercialization of PECs, particularly for self-biased water splitting devices aimed at green H 2 production.</description>

      <title>Lithium-Doped Nickel Iron Oxyhydroxide Nanosheets Coupled Polyaniline As Bi-Functional Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen/Oxygen Evolution Reactions at All pH Levels</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02583897mtgabs</link>
      <description>Niranjanmurthi Lingappan, Wonoh Lee, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-02(58)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405639662

                Hydrogen represents a carbon-free and sustainable energy carrier. Electrochemical water splitting via hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a green approach for the hydrogen production. Nevertheless, unfavorable thermodynamics and sluggish kinetics limit the water splitting efficiency. While the benchmark catalysts such as Pt@C and RuO 2 /C catalysts display remarkable catalytic activity, the inferior durability remains a major concern. Further, scarcity and high demand result in sharp rise in cost, hindering their large-scale commercialization. Herein we report the synthesis of lithium-doped nickel iron oxyhydroxide nanosheets gown on polyaniline functionalized carbon fiber as (Li@NiFeOOH@PANi-CF) as bi-functional electrocatalyst for HER and OER. In this design, the interfacial PANi layers substantially improve the surface functionality of the CF substrate and thereby facilitates strong coupling interaction with the Li@NiFeOOH catalyst, which influences the charge transport kinetics across the catalyst/substrate interface and also maintains the structural integrity of the overall catalyst throughout the cyclic and long-term durability tests. Furthermore, the Li@NiFeOOH provide abundant active sites for the dissociation of water, while the PANi-CF facilitates the adsorption of H + ions from the intermediates and promotes its convention to hydrogen molecules, which accelerates the HER effectively. Due to these intriguing features, the Li@NiFeOOH@PANi-CF manifested remarkable HER efficiency with low overpotential (34, 42, and 53 mV mV at 10 mA cm - 2 ) in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes. Besides, the Li@NiFeOOH@PANi-CF demonstrated better OER durability even in acidic electrolyte. As a key functionality, PANi layers protected the carbon surface from corrosive reactions and suppressed the active catalyst dissolution, resulting in high tolerance for both HER and OER at all pH conditions.</description>

      <title>Oxygen Evolution Behavior of Ni-Containing Alloy Electrodes in NaOH&#8211;KOH Hydrate Melt</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02573807mtgabs</link>
      <description>Kenji Kawaguchi, Toshiyuki Nohira, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-02(57)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405639663

                Hydrogen is expected to be the next-generation energy carrier with zero CO 2 emissions. Alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) is one of the methods for hydrogen production; however, improving its energy efficiency is a challenge. We are currently developing a highly efficient water electrolysis using hydroxide hydrate melts at 150&#8211;200&#176;C [1,2]. Recently, we reported that the overpotential for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at a Ni electrode in a NaOH&#8211;KOH hydrate melt at 200&#176;C under atmospheric pressure was significantly reduced compared to a 30 wt% KOH aqueous solution at 80&#176;C, which is a typical electrolyte for conventional commercial AWE [2]. In addition, the OER overpotential was found to be larger than the HER overpotential at the Ni electrode in the NaOH&#8211;KOH hydrate melt [2]. In the present study, we investigated the OER behavior of Ni-containing alloys in the NaOH&#8211;KOH hydrate melt. Linear sweep voltammetry was performed in the NaOH&#8211;KOH hydrate melt (NaOH:KOH:H 2 O = 9:61:30 mol%) at 150 and 200&#176;C using a three-electrode cell. Several types of commercially available Ni-containing alloy plates with a flag-shaped and 3 mm diameter were used as the working electrode. A Ni rod was used as the counter electrode. A palladium hydride (Pd&#8211;H) electrode was used as the reference electrode and the potential was calibrated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). All measured potentials were IR compensated. All measurements were performed in stationary electrolytes under Ar gas flow at atmospheric pressure. Figure 1 shows anodic polarization curves at Ni&#8211;Fe and Ni&#8211;Cu alloy electrodes in the NaOH&#8211;KOH hydrate melt at 150&#176;C. The polarization of Ni&#8211;Fe and Ni&#8211;Cu alloy electrodes is lower than that of the Ni electrode. In this paper, we will also present the results for other Ni-containing alloys.

      <title>(Invited) Structure and Reactivity of Cobalt-Containing Nanocomposites for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution in Acid Medium</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02594021mtgabs</link>
      <description>Iwona A. Rutkowska, Marzena Krech, Olena Siamuk, Pawe&#322; J. Kulesza, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-02(59)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405639694

                Electrochemical water splitting involves two heterogeneous multi-step half-reactions, which are referred to as the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). It should be noted that the OER under acidic conditions has the following two advantages compared to the process in neutral and alkaline solutions. The kinetics of the OER in acidic media could be much faster due to the higher proton transfer rate between anode and cathode. The proton exchange membrane (PEM) is an acidic solid polymer electrolyte membrane characterized by good proton conductivity, excellent electrochemical durability, and high mechanical strength. Polynuclear iron(III) hexacyanoferrate(II), or Prussian blue, and its analogues possess unique open framework structures with the general chemical formula of A x M y [Fe-(CN) 6 ]z&#183;nH 2 O (where A = alkali metal cation, M = transition metal cation). The possibility to accommodate different transition metal cations within the coordination framework renders them with appealing electrochemical, ion-exchange, sensing, or photomagnetic properties, which have been the subject of intense research for decades. Despite their rigid structure, these mixed-metal coordination polymers are usually nonstoichiometric. This chemical variety makes them a versatile type of molecule-based materials. Prussian Blue type cobalt hexacyanoferrates seem to activate water molecules during photoelectrochemical oxidations. Here we report the water oxidation catalytic activity found in Prussian blue-type cobalt hexacyanoferrate modified electrodes both under conventional electrochermcal and photoelectrochemical conditions (using WO 3 n-type semiconductor) in acid medium. It is noteworthy that some of the hybrid cobalt-ruthenium hexacyanoferrate compositions showed remarkable catalytic ability towards the oxygen evolution reaction in acid electrolyte. The enhanced catalytic activities of the as-synthesized electrodes should also be attributed to such features as high population of hydroxyl groups and high Broensted acidity (due to presence of Ru or W oxo sites) and related fast electron transfers coupled to unimpeded proton displacements. The possibility of metal-metal interactions between nanosized metals (Co and Ru or Co and W) cannot be excluded For comparison, we also show that mixed-metal oxide nanocomposites combining the favorable catalytic properties of Co 3 O 4 and CeO 2 , nanocomposites (with different phase distribution and Co 3 O 4 loading) can modify the cobalt-oxo-species and enhance its intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction activity. Synthesis of Co 3 O 4 -modified CeO 2 , which was addressed through three different sol-gel based routes, each with 10.4 wt% Co 3 O 4 loading, yielded three different nanocomposite morphologies: CeO 2 -supported Co 3 O 4 layers, intermixed oxides, and homogeneously dispersed Co. It is reasonable to expect that the local bonding environment of Co 3 O 4 can be modified after the introduction of nanocrystalline CeO 2 , which allows the Co III species to be easily oxidized into catalytically active Co IV species, thus avoiding the undesirable surface reconstruction process. Here, ceria is likely to regulate the surface oxygen concentration, due to its oxygen buffer (storage/release) capacity, associated with the fast Ce IV /Ce III redox transition. Our research addresses the problems related to the fabrication of efficient earth-abundant catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction, and it provides strategies for designing more active and stable catalytic systems.</description>

                To enhance the catalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at water electrolysis electrodes, it is imperative to eliminate the energy-consuming processes involved in multiple electron and proton transfer reactions. We propose employing a combination of machine-learning analysis of electrochemical activity and in-situ electrochemical Raman observation for the OER electrodes. The OER behavior can be categorized based on the contributions of Ni-OH and Ni-OOH, which serve as key OER intermediates. This information is utilized to elucidate the OER behavior through energetic and intermediate analyses. The presented study provides the direction for designing active OER catalysis in the future.</description>

                Water electrolysis emerges as a pivotal technology for hydrogen production in the quest for sustainable energy solutions, distinguished by its lack of carbon dioxide emissions. This study zeroes in on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a critical yet energy-intensive component of the electrolysis process. We study the effects of modulating the nickel-iron (NiFe) ratio in NiFe selenides, a leading non-precious metal catalyst for OER, on the reaction's efficiency. Our findings elucidate how variations in the NiFe ratio and electrochemical activation methods on nickel selenium (NiSe) significantly influence catalytic performance. We elucidate the performance variations in catalysts using in situ Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These advanced analytical techniques have allowed us to uncover the pivotal role of selenium not only in increasing active surface area via its dissolution but also in enhancing the activity of catalysts for the OER.</description>

                The exact mechanism and surface coverage present on (photo)-catalysts used for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remain elusive. Time-resolved in-operando spectroscopy on model single crystal surfaces has started to clarify these questions but requires strong first- principles theoretical support to facilitate the interpretation of the spectroscopic signatures. The trapping of photo-generated holes as polarons on adsorbs at the catalyst surface is a key step in the photo-driven OER. We model from first principles the optical signature of these hole polarons on OER intermediates (OH2, OH, O) on titanium-based photocatalysts (SrTiO3 and TiO2), and use our results to assign experimental absorptive peaks to hole trapping at specific adsorbates.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the Relationship between Crystallographic Structure and Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity of Nickel Cobalt Oxide Thin Films</title>

                The development of a sustainable energy system relies on the production of green hydrogen. One of the major challenges for water splitting is the synthesis of platinum group metal-free oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. Spinel nickel cobalt oxides (NCOs) have attracted particular interest due to their stable electrocatalytic performance. The less researched rock-salt NCOs, however, are also promising due to their ability to convert to the OER-active hydroxide phase 1 . Further development of NCO electrocatalysts requires fundamental understanding of their crystallographic structure-OER performance relationship. This work addresses ~20 nm atomic layer deposited (ALD) NCO thin film systems with a broad composition range to unravel the above-mentioned relationship. Our previously developed ALD supercycle process 2 based on Ni( Me Cp) 2 , CoCp 2 and O 2 plasma is employed to generate a full range of chemical compositions, such that the phase transition from Ni-rich rock-salt films to Co-rich films at ~55 at.% Co can be observed. Extensive material characterisation reveals that the phase transition is accompanied by an increase in the +3/+2 ratio of the oxidation state of both Ni and Co. Electrochemical analysis in 1M KOH shows an optimal performance for the 30 at.% Co rock-salt film after 500 CV cycles and a synergistic effect between cobalt and nickel such that NCO films are more OER active than Co 3 O 4 and NiO. The films show a composition-dependent activation during CV cycling, where a decrease in activation is observed for increasing Co at.%. No activation is observed for the spinel films. The activation is driven by bulk transformation to the active (oxy)hydroxide phase and is accompanied by an increase in electrochemical surface area (ECSA) up to a factor 8 for rock-salt films. The overpotential after cycling is corrected for the increase in ECSA using an original method, which reveals that Ni-rich spinel structure films are intrinsically more active 3 . The use of model systems in combination with extensive material characterisation and prolonged electrochemical testing allows us to distinguish two classes of NCO catalysts, the instantly active and highly stable Co-rich spinel films and the high surface area Ni-rich rock-salt phase which develops upon extensive activation . Placing these results in perspective, we conclude that application of these catalysts on high surface area 3D electrodes would benefit from the more intrinsically active spinel NCO films, whilst activated rock-salt films would be the preferred choice for thin film electrocatalysis studies. These results also show that rock-salt NCO films (&lt;40 at.% Co) could be a more sustainable alternative to the more commonly used spinel NCO films. 1 Gebreslase et al. J.

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key reaction in several photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical reaction schemes. While iridium-based materials such as iridium dioxide are commonly used to catalyze the OER, contemporary findings indicate that iridium dioxide will undergo substantial corrosion during operation. A fundamental understanding of the degradation pathways during the OER is necessary to design materials that exhibit improved stability and enable the long-term operation of photocatalytic and photoelectrochemical devices. The Moreno-Hernandez Laboratory utilizes liquid phase transmission electron microscopy techniques that enable nanoscale and near-atomic spatial resolution imaging in liquid environments during electrocatalyst operation. These techniques were used to probe the stability of iridium dioxide nanocrystals and observe electrocatalyst degradation at near-atomic resolution for individual nanocrystals, and at nanoscale resolution for nanocrystal ensembles. Our observations indicate several reaction pathways and nanocrystal properties that were previously underexplored could have a substantial impact on the macroscale performance of iridium-based materials.</description>

                Efficient seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production faces challenges like active site poisoning, chloride oxidation, and anode corrosion, necessitating the development of effective oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts [1] . Strategies such as enhancing OER kinetics, mitigating chloride oxidation, bolstering corrosion resistance, and integrating multifunctionality into electrocatalysts are being pursued. Researchers explore internal and external cultivation methods to optimize electrocatalyst properties while understanding structural evolution and OER mechanisms remains crucial. Seawater electrolysis, tapping into Earth's abundant seawater resources, offers a scalable solution for green hydrogen production, especially when paired with renewable energy sources [2] . It holds promise for providing energy and water to offshore areas and mobile maritime systems, crucial for addressing energy and environmental challenges. In this study, we have fabricated a PGM (platinum group metal) free anode that shows promising performance in alkaline seawater. The material consists of nanoclusters of FeNiS x . This study applied a polyol-assisted hydrothermal synthesis strategy to describe an advanced procedure for synthesising NiFeS x . Several physical and chemical characterisation tools are applied to investigate the anode electrode for alkaline seawater oxidation XRD, SEM, TEM and electrochemical characterisation. The outcomes of these characterisations were displayed as graphs. The catalysts reveal nanocluster morphologies. The figure below depicts the preliminary findings, illustrating the electrochemical performance and the physical characterisations. Figure 1 (a ) and (b) depict the morphological evaluation by electron microscopy revealing the nanostructure-based clusters of the produced materials with the scanning and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. In. Polarisation curves of the oxygen evolution activity of the synthesised NiFeiS x electrocatalysts on Ni foam working electrodes, in a three-electrode configuration with Pt wire serving as the counter and Hg/HgO serving as the reference electrode in 0.1M KOH + 0.5 NaCl electrolyte. The best-performing catalysts obtained a high current exchange density close to 225 mAcm -2 shown in Figure 1(c) . In addition, we are evaluating the efficacy of this high-performance anode electrocatalyst in a single-cell electrolyser and the best and most stable catalyst will be tested in stacks we are developing with our partners in the ANEMEL project. Our research methodology encompasses a comprehensive array of ex-situ and in-situ characterization techniques to delve into the intricacies of seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production. We will utilize impedance spectroscopy to dissect electrochemical behaviour, including resistance, capacitance, and charge transfer resistance. Additionally, chronopotentiometry/chronoamperometry will assess the catalyst's long-term stability, while real-time examination of catalyst crystal structure during OER will be facilitated by Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). Surface chemistry and elemental composition analysis will be conducted using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), while in-situ Raman spectroscopy will offer insights into electronic structure changes during the reaction, shedding light on the OER mechanism. Furthermore, FTIR spectroscopy will unveil reaction intermediates and mechanisms, providing a detailed understanding of the reaction pathway. Post-mortem catalyst analysis post-electrochemical testing will evaluate degradation, ultimately aiding in optimizing catalyst design for long-term stability and high-performance OER.

                Oxygen-evolving electrocatalysts in acid undergo structural changes that result in a loss of activity, which necessitates high catalyst loadings of precious noble metal oxides. A fundamental understanding of the structural dynamics at the electrode/electrolyte interface that occur during oxygen evolution is necessary to design the next generation of electrocatalyst materials with improved performance. The Moreno-Hernandez Laboratory utilizes liquid phase transmission electron microscopy to directly observe the stability of single-nanocrystalline and highly faceted metal oxide nanocrystals under anodic conditions in acidic electrolytes. Our studies reveal the distribution of stability relationships between different crystallographic facets for nanocrystalline materials, and enable the direct determination of nanoscale heterogeneity at the single nanocrystal level. Substantial stability differences are observed across multiple nanocrystals, which are correlated to variability in the nanoscale strain present in individual nanocrystals. These studies suggest that nanoscale heterogeneity occluded in conventional bulk-scale analysis techniques substantially influences stability under relevant operation conditions, and provide crucial information for the design of resilient electrocatalyst materials.</description>

                Carbon decomposition by molten salt electrolysis has been researched for achievement of carbon negative emissions. Carbonate ions, which are derived from carbon dioxides and oxide ion in the molten salts, are reduced into carbon and oxide ions are produced at cathodes. Oxygen gas is generated from the produced oxide ions at anodes. For realizing the electrochemical carbon decomposition process, development of inert anode is essential task. In the previous research, various materials of metal, cermet and metal oxide have been tested for inert anodes to obtain low corrosion rate and high current density in electrochemical oxygen evolution. Especially, conductive oxides are expected to have both of high electrical conductivity and high corrosion resistance to produced oxygen. In this study, we report the characteristics of Co-based oxide anodes for oxygen evolution in chloride melts. Co 3 O 4 is one of the representative conductive oxides, which have conduction characteristic. In the experiments of molten chloride containing oxide ions at a temperature over 600&#8451;, the cyclic voltammograms with a prepared Co 3 O 4 anode were measured. The results show drastically increases of current density at 2.9 V vs Ca(&#8545;)/Ca, which was approximately same to the oxygen evolution potential estimated from thermodynamic calculations. The corrosion behaviors of Co-based anodes will be discussed from the results of long-time electrochemical operation and chemical analysis using XRD, SEM, EDs, and ICP-AES analysis.</description>

                The advancement of water electrolysis technology has seemingly plateaued. Further advances require new strategies to address the key limitations of the oxygen evolution reaction: high overpotential and low stability of electrode materials. Herein, we designed a nanoporous Ir 3 Co-core@IrO 2 -shell electrocatalyst with 5 and 3 times higher mass activity and 6 and 2 times higher activity&#8211;stability factors than conventional IrO 2 nanoparticles and Ir nanoporous electrocatalysts, respectively. The origin of the performance enhancement in the Ir 3 Co-core@IrO 2 -shell electrocatalyst was revealed in computational density functional theory calculations. The residual Co after the dealloying process resulted in a down-shift of the d -band center position, thus weakening the &#8722;OH* adsorption energy. In addition, the electronic conductivity was enhanced by the three-dimensionally interconnected structure. Under high-current-density operating conditions, the Ohmic losses were reduced by the ultrafast charge transfer pathway provided by the metallic IrCo core.</description>

                Direct seawater electrolysis is a promising approach to producing green hydrogen in water-scarce environments using renewable energy. However, the undesirable chlorine evolution reaction (CER) and hypochlorite evolution reaction (HCER) compete with the desired oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the anode electrocatalyst. This issue is most pronounced in unbuffered pH neutral solutions due to local acidification resulting from the OER. To overcome this challenge, this study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the use of silicon oxide (SiO x ) and titanium oxide (TiO x ) nanoscale overlayers coated on metallic ruthenium (Ru) and ruthenium oxide (RuO x ) thin film electrodes and their ability to block chloride ions from reaching active sites during operation in unbuffered 0.6 M NaCl electrolyte. Using a combination of (electro)analytical techniques, encapsulated RuO x anodes are shown to effectively suppress Cl - transport to buried catalyst active sites while allowing for the desired OER to occur, leading to increases in OER faradaic efficiency at moderate overpotentials. Evidence for the ability of SiO x overlayers to block Cl - ions from reaching the active buried interface was obtained by monitoring the OH stretching mode of OH adsorbates using in situ Raman spectroscopy. This study also reports trade-offs between the activity, selectivity, and stability of bare and encapsulated Ru and RuO x electrocatalysts, finding that the magnitude of these trade-offs strongly depends on the complex interplay between electrode architecture, material properties, and catalytic performance, especially in unbuffered pH neutral seawater.</description>

      <title>Lanthanum-Promoted Electrocatalyst for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction: Unique Catalyst or Oxide Deconstruction?</title>

                A conventional performance metric for electrocatalysts that promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is the current density at a given overpotential. However, the assumption that increased current density at lower overpotentials indicates superior catalyst design is precarious for OER catalysts in the working environment, as the crystalline lattice is prone to deconstruction and amorphization, thus greatly increasing the concentration of catalytic active sites. We show this to be the case for La3+ incorporation into Co3O4. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Raman spectroscopy and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) reveal smaller domain sizes with decreased long-range order and increased amorphization for La-modified Co3O4. This lattice deconstruction is exacerbated under the conditions of OER as indicated by operando spectroscopies. The overpotential for OER decreases with increasing La3+ concentration, with maximum activity achieved at 17% La incorporation. HRTEM images and electron diffraction patterns clearly show the formation of an amorphous overlayer during OER catalysis that is accelerated with La3+ addition. O 1s XPS spectra after OER show the loss of lattice-oxide and an increase in peak intensities associated with hydroxylated or defective O-atom environments, consistent with Co(O)x(OH)y species in an amorphous overlayer. Our results suggest that improved catalytic activity of oxides incorporated with La3+ ions (and likely other metal ions) is due to an increase in the number of terminal octahedral Co(O)x(OH)y edge sites upon Co3O4 lattice deconstruction, rather than enhanced intrinsic catalysis.</description>

                Abstract The cooperation between metal single atom (SA) and atomic cluster (AC) within an electrocatalyst has showcased enormous potential in 2e &#8722; oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) production. Nevertheless, developing an SA&#8208;AC catalyst with the synergy of optimized functional groups to afford advanced catalytic capability has been challenging. Herein, a new and highly effective catalyst with tandem cobalt SA&#8208;AC moieties and C&#9472;O&#9472;C functional group decorations anchored over carbon nanotubes is presented, which is denoted as Co SA&#8208;AC(C&#9472;O&#9472;C). As an electrocatalyst, Co SA&#8208;AC(C&#9472;O&#9472;C) demonstrates favorable activity, selectivity, and stability for 2e &#8722; ORR, delivering an onset potential of 0.72 V (vs RHE) and an H 2 O 2 selectivity of 97.6% in 0.5 m H 2 SO 4 . In a flow&#8208;cell reactor, the Co SA&#8208;AC(C&#9472;O&#9472;C) realizes an H 2 O 2 production rate of 3.88 mol g cat &#8722;1 h &#8722;1 at 300 mA cm &#8722;2 targeting on&#8208;site pollutant treatment by integrating a Fenton&#8208;like process. The theoretical computations guide the selection of C&#9472;O&#9472;C among the functional group decorations and reveal the actual active sites to locate at Co SAs, while the synergistic effect of Co ACs and C&#9472;O&#9472;C groups helps optimize the * OOH binding and modulate the electronic structure.</description>

                Abstract As the energy industries, such as secondary batteries and fuel cells, expand rapidly, the demand for transition metals used as electrode materials is increasing, which has led to a rise in their prices. One promising strategy to address these challenges is upcycling, which involves recycling transition metal&#8208;based waste from various industries. In this study, a heterostructure electrocatalyst for anion exchange membrane water electrolysis is developed by upcycling iron&#8208;based waste from the automotive industry. The iron&#8208;based swarf is converted into single&#8208;phase Fe 2 O 3 by removing surface impurities through calcination in air. Subsequently, NiFe&#8208;LDH is formed via sequential hydrothermal synthesis, resulting in NiFe&#8208;LDH/Fe 2 O 3 heterostructured electrocatalysts. The hetero&#8208;interface between NiFe&#8208;LDH and Fe 2 O 3 significantly reduced the electrochemical activation barrier, enhancing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity and, furthermore, achieving high&#8208;performance AEMWE. This approach not only reduces waste but also provides a cost&#8208;effective alternative to traditional materials, highlighting the potential for sustainable and efficient energy solutions.</description>

                Abstract Low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for water electrolysis. Herein, the synthesis of low&#8208;cost Fe/P&#8208;CoO 2 amorphous catalyst is reported, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1 m KOH. Assembled Pt/C||Co 0.75 Fe 0.25 P/MWCNTs system affords a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 at a cell voltage of only 1.53 V, which is much better than that of the benchmark Pt/C||RuO 2 system (1.62 V). Such performance lies ointhe electronic mediation of active sites with asymmetric Co&#8208; and Fe&#8208;coordination structures with different d&#8208;band occupancy. The combination of Fe&#8208;cationic and P&#8208;anionic coordination effectively optimizes the adsorption of OER intermediates (OH * , O * ), promoting direct O * &#9472;O * coupling and avoiding the formation of unstable OOH * intermediate. Benefiting from these advantages, Co 0.75 Fe 0.25 P/MWCNTs demonstrate excellent OER activity and stability, surpassing the benchmark RuO 2 . The proposed strategy presents a novel approach for the synthesis of cost&#8208;effective, highly efficient, and durable electrocatalysts for alkaline OER.</description>

                Abstract Ruthenium oxide (RuO 2 ) is considered one of the most promising catalysts for replacing iridium oxide (IrO 2 ) in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nevertheless, the performance of RuO 2 remains unacceptable due to the dissolution of Ru and the lack of *OH in acidic environments. This paper reports a grain boundary (GB)&#8208;rich porous RuO 2 electrocatalyst for the efficient and stable acidic OER. The involvement of GB regulates the valence state of Ru and weakens the interaction between Ru and O, effectively facilitating *OH adsorption and *OOH formation. Notably, achieved a record&#8208;high catalytic activity (145 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) with a low Tafel slope (40.9 mV dec &#8722;1 ) and a remarkable mass activity of 332 mA mg &#8722;1 Ru at 1.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode is achieved. Additionally, the porous RuO 2 exhibits superb stability with an ultra&#8208;low degradation rate of 26 &#181;V h &#8722;1 over a 50&#8208;day durability test. This study opens a viable pathway for the development of efficient and robust Ru&#8208;based acidic OER electrocatalysts.</description>

                The high cost and low energy efficiency of conventional water electrolysis methods continue to restrict the widespread adoption of green hydrogen. Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis is a promising technology that can produce hydrogen using cost-effective transition metal catalysts at high energy efficiency. Herein, we investigate the catalytic activity of nickel and iron nanoparticles dispersed on metal-oxide supports for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), employing electrochemical testing with an anion exchange ionomer to evaluate their potential for application in AEM electrolyzers. We report the electrochemical performance of NiFe nanoparticles of varying Ni:Fe ratios on CeO2 for OER reaction, assessing the overpotential, Tafel slope and electrochemical stability of the catalysts. Our findings indicate that Ni90Fe10 has the highest catalytic activity as well as stability. To further understand the role of different supports, we assess the electrocatalytic performance of Ni90Fe10 nanoparticles on two more supports - TiO2 and ZrO2. While CeO2 has the lowest overpotential, the other supports also show high activity and good performance at high current density. TiO2 exhibits superior stability and its overpotential after chronopotentiometry measurements approaches that of CeO2 at high current densities. These results underscore the critical role of iron addition in enhancing nickel nanoparticles' catalytic activity and further emphasize the importance of metal oxide supports in improving catalyst stability and performance.</description>

                Abstract Photovoltaic&#8208;driven electrochemical (PV&#8208;EC) carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 R) coupled with sulfide oxidation (SOR) can efficiently convert the solar energy into chemical energy, expanding its applications. However, developing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts that exhibit high selectivity and efficiency for both CO 2 R and SOR remains a challenge. Herein, a bifunctional copper selenide catalyst is developed with copper vacancies (v&#8208;CuSe 2 ) for the CO 2 R&#8208;SOR. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 62.4% for methane at &#8722;200 mA cm &#8722;2 is achieved in the cathodic CO 2 R. In a two&#8208;electrode CO 2 R&#8208;SOR system with 16 h of long&#8208;term operation at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 , an average Faradaic efficiency of 57.2% for methane and 97.7% for sulfur powder generation is achieved at cathode and anode, respectively. Compared to the coupling of CO 2 R with oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the energy efficiency (EE) of the CO 2 R&#8208;SOR system can be increased to 22.9%. The mechanism study has found that the synergistic effect of copper vacancies and introduced Se significantly enhances the selectivity toward methane. Driven by silicon solar cells, a solar&#8208;to&#8208;methane conversion efficiency of 2% is achieved.</description>

                Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) finds extensive applications in various industries, particularly in the environmental field. The photocatalytic production of H2O2 through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or the water oxidation reaction (WOR) offers a promising approach. However, several challenges hinder effective on-site production, such as the rapid electron&#8211;hole pair recombination, inefficient visible light utilization, and limited selectivity in H2O2 formation. Thus, developing efficient photocatalysts to overcome these challenges is crucial. This review comprehensively outlines the development of photocatalysts and their modification techniques. It also summarizes and compares the H2O2 yield and apparent quantum yield among various photocatalysts with and without the use of organic sacrificial reagents. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations propose the band structure of photocatalysts and the mechanisms underlying oxygen reduction to H2O2. Finally, this review explores the potential environmental applications of photocatalytically produced H2O2. This review guides the design and optimization of photocatalysts, facilitating the continued advancement and application of photocatalysts in environmental contexts.</description>

                MXene 2D materials and non&#8208;noble transition metal oxide nanoparticles have been proposed as novel pH&#8208;universal platforms for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), owing to the enhancement of active site exposures and conductivity. Herein, Co3O4&#8208;RuO2 /Ti3C2Tx/carbon cloths (CRMC) were assembled in a facile way as an efficient OER platform through a hydrothermal process. The Co3O4&#8208;RuO2/Ti3C2Tx demonstrated prominent OER catalytic performance under acidic and alkaline conditions, which showed overpotential values of 195 and 247 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 with Tafel slopes of 93 and 97 mVdec&#8208;1, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the electron transfer from Co3O4&#8208;RuO2 to Ti3C2Tx/carbon cloth played a remarkable role in promoting OER catalytic activity. Further OER characterization indicated that the enhanced multi&#8208;electron reaction kinetics are attributed to Co and Ru acting as the primary active places for O2 adsorption and activation, which facilitated the generation of *OOH intermediate.</description>

                Oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER, respectively) are the two most extensively studied reactions in electrochemistry. Herein, we report the synthesis of Co3O4/CeO2/GNP (GNP=graphene nanoplatelet) electrocatalyst for ORR and OER that exhibits an early onset potential (0.85 V) and half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.69 V for ORR. The reported catalyst is highly durable with 87.6% retention of its initial current after a 6 h chronoamperometry test compared to 72.5% by Pt/C. It exhibits a negligible shift of E1/2 after 10,000 potential cycles for ORR. Heterogeneous oxide/oxide interfaces, oxygen vacancies and semicrystalline nature are inferenced to play a dominant role in altering the collective catalytic efficiency of Co3O4/CeO2/GNP. High concentration of oxygen vacancy defects (68%) in Co3O4/CeO2/GNP is presumed to play a dominant role here. The catalyst is bifunctional for ORR and OER with a bifunctionality index of 0.98 V and operates at an overpotential of &#414;10= 440 mV for OER. Ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption studies indicate an increased average oxidation state of Co by 15% in Co3O4/CeO2/GNP compared to Co3O4/GNP, aiding in preserving its inherent catalytic nature of spinel Co3O4.</description>

                FeOOH with excellent catalytic properties for oxygen evolution and also considered to be a true active site has attracted great interest in recent years. However, the intrinsic low conductivity limits its catalytic performance. Herein, a one&#8208;dimensional core&#8208;shell NiMoO4/FeOOH heterojunction with high OER activity and stability was developed. At current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2, low overpotentials of 194 and 266 mV are need to drive oxygen evolution, meanwhile, the electrode exhibits high catalytic kinetics with small Tafel slopes of 53.4 mV dec&#8208;1 and excellent stability over 100 hours. Further analysis showed that the ultrathin FeOOH layer (~5 nm) uniformly covered the surface of NiMoO4 nanorods, acting as an active species and facilitating the surface change transfer to the interior. The internal NiMoO4 cores, on the other hand, provides reliable electron transmission as a highly conductive medium, and can effectively overcome the low conductivity of FeOOH. DFT calculations further manifest the strong electronic interactions between NiMoO4 and FeOOH species. The NiMoO4 core serves as mass transport of active materials is beneficial to tune the adsorption energy of OH&#8208; on the surface of electrocatalysts.</description>

                The photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from oxygen (O2) represents a promising catalytic pathway, the limited efficiency of the oxygen reduction constitutes a primary barrier to enhancing production. In this content, alkali metal potassium (K+) and Br&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4 photocatalysts (K&#8208;CN) were successfully constructed by one&#8208;pot method. The introduction of K+ is not only beneficial to the transmission of space charge and the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, but also promotes the efficient production of H2O2 by 2e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction. The introduction of Br&#8208; promotes O2 converted to triplet state and triggers energy transfer process to increase 1O2 production, O2 adsorption was facilitated through regulating the oxygen evolution (O2&#8594;1O2), which is beneficial to the subsequent oxygen reduction process. The results showed that the H2O2 yield of 0.05 K&#8208;CN catalyst reached 26.0 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which was more than 5 times that of pure g&#8208;C3N4.</description>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting, which produces hydrogen and oxygen through water electrolysis, is a promising method for generating renewable, carbon-free alternative fuels. However, its widespread adoption is hindered by the high costs of Pt cathodes and IrO$_{x}$/RuO$_{x}$ anode catalysts. In the search for cost-effective alternatives, barium titanate (BaTiO$_{3}$) has emerged as a compelling candidate. This inexpensive, non-toxic perovskite oxide can be synthesized from earth-abundant precursors and has shown potential for catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in recent studies. In this work, we explore the OER activity of pristine and Ni-doped BaTiO$_{3}$ at explicit water interfaces using metadynamics (MetaD) simulations. To enable efficient and practical MetaD for OER, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential based on artificial neural networks (ANN), achieving large-scale and long-time simulations with near-DFT accuracy. Our simulations reveal that Ni-doping enhances the catalytic activity of BaTiO$_{3}$ for OER, consistent with experimental observations, while providing mechanistic insights into this enhancement.</description>

      <title>A high&#8208;entropy engineering on sustainable anionic redox Mn&#8208;based cathode with retardant stress for high&#8208;rate sodium&#8208;ion batteries</title>

                Manganese&#8208;based (Mn&#8208;based) layered oxides have emerged as competitive cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), primarily due to their high energy density, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and potential for mass production. However, these materials often suffer from irreversible oxygen redox reactions, significant phase transitions, and microcrack formation, which lead to considerable internal stress and degradation of electrochemical performance. This study introduces a high&#8208;entropy engineering strategy for P2&#8208;type Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes (HE&#8208;NMCO), wherein a multi&#8208;ingredient cocktail effect strengthens the lattice framework by modulating the local environmental chemistry. This innovative approach fosters sustainable reversible oxygen activity, mitigates stress concentrations at grain boundaries, and accelerates Na&#8314; transport kinetics. The resulting robust lattice framework with optimized elemental interactions significantly improves structural integrity and reduces the formation of intragranular fractures. Consequently, HE&#8208;NMCO demonstrates remarkable cycling stability, retaining 93.5% capacity after 100 deep (de)sodiation cycles, alongside an enhanced rate capability of 134.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5C. Notably, comparative studies through multimodal characterization techniques highlight HE&#8208;NMCO's superior reversibility in oxygen anion redox (OAR) reactions over extensive cycling, contrasting sharply with conventional NMCO cathode. This work elucidates the potential for advancing high energy and power density Mn&#8208;based cathodes for SIBs through local species diversity.</description>

                Developing durably active catalysts to tackle harsh voltage polarization and seawater corrosion is pivotal for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion, yet remains a challenge. We report a durably active catalyst of NiCr&#8208;layered double hydroxide (RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH) with highly exposed Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ru units, in which low&#8208;loading Ru (0.32 wt%) is locked precisely at defect lattice site (Rulds) by Ni and Cr. The Cr site electron equilibrium reservoir and Cl&#8208; repulsion by intercalated CO32&#8208; ensure the highly durable activity of Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ru units. The RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH&#8214;RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH electrolyzer based on anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM&#8208;WE) shows ultrastable seawater electrolysis at 1000 mA cm&#8208;2. Employing RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH both as anode and cathode, a photovoltaic&#8208;electrolysis seawater system achieves a 17.73% STH efficiency, corresponding photoelectricity&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (PVTH) efficiency is 72.37%. Further, we elucidate the dynamic evolutionary mechanism involving the interfacial water dissociation&#8208;oxidation, establishing the correlation between the dynamic behavior of interfacial water with the kinetics, activity of RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH catalytic water electrolysis. Our work is a breakthrough step for achieving economically scalable production of green hydrogen.</description>

                The rational design of metal oxide catalysts with enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is crucial for the practical application of aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (a&#8208;r&#8208;ZABs). Precisely regulating the electronic environment of metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8208;O) active species is critical yet challenging for improving their activity and stability toward OER and ORR. Herein, we propose an atomic&#8208;level bilateral regulation strategy by introducing atomically dispersed Ga for continuously tuning the electronic environment of Ru&#8208;O and Mn&#8208;O in the Ga/MnRuO2 catalyst. The Ga/MnRuO2 catalyst breaks the stability&#8208;activity restriction, showing remarkable bifunctional performance with a low potential gap (&#916;E) of 0.605 V and super durability with negligible performance degradation (300,000 ORR cycles or 30,000 OER cycles). The theoretical calculations revealed that the strong coupling electron interactions between Ga and Ru&#8208;O/Mn&#8208;O tuned the valence state distribution of the metal center, effectively modulating the adsorption behavior of *O/*OH, thus optimizing the reaction pathways and reducing the reaction barriers. The a&#8208;r&#8208;ZABs based on Ga/MnRuO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance with a wide working temperature range of &#8208;20~60 &#176;C and a long lifetime of 2308 hours (i.e., 13,848 cycles) under a current density of 5 mA cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;20 &#176;C.</description>

                Abstract The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mainly encompasses four elementary reactions, involving intermediates such as HO*, O*, and HOO*. Balancing the Gibbs free energies of these intermediates at a single active site is a challenging task. In this work, a high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic framework incorporating Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, and Y metal elements is synthesized using an electrodeposition method, which then serves as a template for preparing a high&#8208;entropy phosphide/carbon (FeCoNiCuYP/C) composite. Notably, the obtained composite exhibits an amorphous structure with multiple catalytically active sites. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental measurements reveal the critical roles of Co/Ni and Fe atoms in tuning the electronic structure of FeCoNiCuYP and optimizing the binding strength of intermediates. Furthermore, Fe and Ni/Co sites prefer to stabilize the HO* and HOO* intermediates respectively, conducive to breaking their scaling relation of Gibbs free energy during OER. Owing to its fine&#8208;tuned composition and the synergistic effect of multiple active sites, the FeCoNiCuYP/C electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance in alkaline solutions, requiring a mere 316 mV overpotential to yield 100 mA cm &#8722;2 current density with excellent stability. This work provides an innovative route to design efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts, holding significant promise for cutting&#8208;edge electrocatalytic applications.</description>

                Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis faces challenges associated with high overpotential and acidic environments, which pose significant hurdles in developing highly active and durable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ir-based nanomaterials are considered promising OER catalysts for PEM due to their favorable intrinsic activity and stability under acidic conditions. However, their high cost and limited availability pose significant limitations. Consequently, numerous studies have emerged aimed at reducing iridium content while maintaining high activity and durability. Furthermore, the research on the OER mechanism of Ir-based catalysts has garnered widespread attention due to differing views among researchers. The recent progress in balancing activity, durability, and low iridium content in Ir-based catalysts is summarized in this review, with a particular focus on the effects of catalyst morphology, heteroatom doping, substrate introduction, and novel structure development on catalyst performance from four perspectives. Additionally, the recent mechanistic studies on Ir-based OER catalysts is discussed, and both theoretical and experimental approaches is summarized to elucidate the Ir-based OER mechanism. Finally, the perspectives on the challenges and future developments of Ir-based OER catalysts is presented.</description>

                Abstract The key ongoing challenge is to design and develop effective and inexpensive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts to replace Pt&#8208;based ones for commercial use in fuel cells. Owing to its abundance and tunable electronic properties, in the current work, the synthesis of highly dispersed mixed valent copper oxide electrocatalyst is reported. The EC exhibits a high mass activity of 9.8 mA mg &#8722;1 and a high current density of 5.3 mA cm &#8722;2 in contrast to the benchmark (20 wt%) Pt/C catalyst in a 0.1&#8208;M KOH solution for ORR. The significantly high electrochemical activity at the cathode is believed to be due to the presence of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox pair. Furthermore, the catalyst has been shown to be highly stable, maintaining a high current retention of 78% for up to 24 h. Furthermore, the engineered material is also active for the oxygen evolution reaction, making it a viable replacement for conventional Pt/C in alkaline fuel cells.</description>

                The combination of the electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction serves to reduce the anodic overpotential, thereby facilitating the efficient production of hydrogen. However, the GOR is confined to a narrow potential range due to the competition of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at high potential. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a catalyst with a high Faraday efficiency of formate (FE</description>

                Abstract The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are key processes in numerous oxygen&#8208;involved applications over a wide temperature range. Despite advances in nanofiber engineering to increase active site density and catalytic efficiency for ORR/OER, conventional electrode fabrication methods often compromise the integrity of nanofibrous structures. Herein, a robust strategy is presented for the fabrication of LaCo 0.6 Ni 0.4 O 3&#8208;&#948; (LCN) nanofibrous membranes using optimized electrospinning techniques. This approach achieves high specific surface area, increased porosity, rapid mass transport, and precise control of morphology and thickness. The resulting LCN nanofibers exhibit exceptional ORR and OER catalytic activity at room temperature, rivaling commercial Pt/C and RuO&#8322; catalysts. Moreover, in solid oxide cells (SOCs) operating at elevated temperatures, LCN nanofibrous membranes deliver remarkable ORR and OER performance, with a peak power density of 0.802 W cm &#8722; 2 at 700 &#176;C and excellent stability over 180 h. These results highlight the potential of nanofibrous perovskite catalysts for practical oxygen electrocatalytic applications and demonstrate that the LCN nanofibrous membrane, combined with a self&#8208;assembly approach, exploits on the advantages of high porosity and specific surface area. This work opens up new avenues for the use of nanofibrous electrodes in a wide temperature range.</description>

                Metal oxyhydroxides have been considered efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and structural flexibility has a significant role in boosting catalytic performance. However, structural control usually requires time-consuming and complicated synthesis stages. Here, a rapid one-step wet-chemical synthetic approach is reported to construct amorphous NiFeOOH nanosheets (a-NiFex NSs). This short-term, low-cost method can efficiently control the crystallinity of the materials. Interestingly, one can regulate the oxygen defect concentration and the metal valence by varying the Ni/Fe ratio. The high-valence metal species and oxygen vacancy in the amorphous structure facilitate the nucleophilic attack of OH&#8211;, activate lattice oxygen, and promote electrocatalytic performance. The optimized a-NiFe0.86 NS exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 309 mV to achieve 100 mA cm&#8211;2 and high stability. This strategy provides a facile and universal approach to fabricating amorphous NiFe-based oxyhydroxides as highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.</description>

                The generation of hydrogen through water electrolysis represents a significant advancement in the transition towards low-carbon energy systems. Graphene-supported catalysts have demonstrated significant potential in improving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) among several electrocatalysts utilised for this process. Nonetheless, attaining exact control over the morphology and electrical configuration of these catalysts continues to pose a considerable difficulty. This study presents the development of a highly effective electrocatalyst composed of graphene-supported NiFe LDH and PbO2, incorporating sulphur anions into the structure by a plasma jet treatment method. By optimising the ratio of sulphur anions, we were able to fine-tune the local coordination environment, which effectively adjusted the properties of the OH and OOH intermediates, thereby improving the OER catalytic performance. The plasma treatment introduced vacancy defects into the catalyst, further regulating its surface morphology and electronic structure. After sulphur anion optimisation, the graphene-supported catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance in alkaline environments, achieving an OER overpotential of 228 mV at 100 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. This performance, along with exceptional stability, exceeds the majority of previously documented catalysts. The results underscore the promise of sulphur anion optimisation and plasma treatment in improving OER performance, providing significant insights for the advancement of highly effective water-splitting catalysts.</description>

                Nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxide shows significant promise as an electrocatalyst in facilitating oxygen evolution reactions. But its development is hindered by low conductivity and insufficient cycling stability. Herein, the synthesis of a hierarchically structured heterostructure catalyst, CeO2@NiFe LDH, is reported through a straightforward two&#8208;step process involving hydrothermal treatment. The catalyst realizes a significant breakthrough in OER catalytic performance and stability. At a current density of 100 mA cm&#8208;2, the overpotentials amount to 255 mV in 1 M KOH, 263 mV in simulated seawater with alkaline conditions, and 346 mV in actual alkaline seawater. After 200 hours of continuous operation under high current density in simulated alkaline seawater, the morphology with no significant alterations observed, highlighting its high stability in complex seawater environments. Introducing CeO2 optimizes the binding energy of the OH intermediate, which facilitates the formation and dissociation of the OOH intermediate. In situ Raman analysis demonstrates the positive impact of CeO2 on the generation of active species. This research emphasizes the efficacy of CeO2 in improving the performance and durability of NiFe LDH for oxygen evolution reactions.</description>

                Abstract Development of high&#8208;performance and inexpensive electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at neutral pH is important for direct seawater splitting and organic electrosynthesis but remains challenging due to the sluggish OER kinetics and diverse side reactions inherent to the constituents of working electrolytes. Herein, we report on a P:NiFe electrode, containing P&#8208;doped NiFe alloy, as an excellent electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER pre&#8208;catalyst for efficient OER in both seawater and organic electrolyte for adiponitrile (ADN) electrosynthesis at neutral pH. Fe and P species modulate the coordination environment of nickel sites, which enables the simultaneous formation of OER&#8208;active nickel species and FePO x passivation layer, thus transforming HER&#8208;active P:NiFe to OER&#8208;active a &#8208;P:NiFe. Besides, the redox&#8208;dependent interconversion between HER&#8208;active P:NiFe and OER&#8208;active a &#8208;P:NiFe is fast and reversible. Finally, efficient and stable overall seawater&#8208;splitting and ADN electrosynthesis at an industrially relevant current density (100 mA cm &#8722;2 ) in pH&#8208;neutral media are also demonstrated.</description>

                Abstract The rational design of multicomponent heterostructure is an effective strategy to enhance the catalytic activity of electrocatalysts for water and seawater electrolysis in alkaline conditions. Herein, MOF&#8208;derived nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon/nickel&#8208;cobalt sulfides coupled vertically aligned Rhenium disulfide (ReS 2 ) on carbon cloth (NC&#8208;CoNi 2 S 4 @ReS 2 /CC) are constructed via hydrothermal and activation approaches. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrates that the strong interactions between multiple interfaces promote electron redistribution and facilitate water dissociation, thereby optimizing *H adsorption energy for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Meanwhile, the adsorption energies of oxygenated intermediates are balanced to reduce the thermodynamic barrier for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Consequently, NC&#8208;CoNi 2 S 4 @ReS 2 /CC shows smaller overpotentials of 87 and 253 mV for HER and OER at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , with a lower Tafel slope and R ct than control samples. Superior catalytic stability is confirmed by cyclic voltammetry (CV) for 1000 cycles and CA test for 56 h. Furthermore, NC&#8208;CoNi 2 S 4 @ReS 2 /CC presents exceptional electrocatalytic activity in both alkaline water/seawater electrolytes. Stability assessments reveal that NC&#8208;CoNi 2 S 4 @ReS 2 /CC maintains a highly catalytic activity in both water and seawater, owing to the corrosion&#8208;resistant properties of the sulfur species at the interface. These findings highlight the importance of designing heterostructure electrocatalysts for clean hydrogen production.</description>

                Developing highly efficient non-iridium-based active sites for acidic water splitting is still a huge challenge. Herein, unique Ru&#8211;B&#8211;Cr moieties have been constructed in RuO2 nanofibers (NFs) to activate Ru sites for water electrolysis, which overcomes the bottleneck of RuO2-based catalysts usually possessing low activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and poor stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The fabricated Cr, B-doped RuO2 NFs exhibit low overpotentials of 205 and 379 mV for acidic HER and OER at 1 A cm&#8211;2 with outstanding stability lasting 1000 and 188 h, respectively. The assembled acidic electrolyzer also possesses great hydrogen production efficiency and durability at a high current density. Experimental and theoretical explorations reveal that the formation of Ru&#8211;B&#8211;Cr moieties effectively optimizes the atomic configurations and modulates the adsorption/desorption free energy of reaction intermediates to achieve exceptional HER and OER performance.</description>

                Surface engineering is sought to stabilize nickel-rich layered oxide cathodes in high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries, which suffer from severe surface oxygen loss and rapid structure degradation, especially during deep delithiation at high voltages or high temperatures. Here, we propose a well-designed oxygen-constraining strategy to address the crisis of oxygen evolution. By integrating a La, Fe gradient diffusion layer and a LaFeO3 coating into the Ni-rich layered particles, along with incorporating an antioxidant binder into the electrodes, three progressive lines of defense are constructed: immobilizing the lattice oxygen at the subsurface, blocking the released oxygen at the interface, and capturing the residual singlet oxygen on the external surface. As a result, effective surface passivation, mitigated bulk and surface degradation, suppressed side reactions, and enhanced electrochemical performance are achieved, far beyond conventional single surface modification. The Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes with integrated oxygen-constraining modifications demonstrate impressive cycling stability in both half-cells and full cells, achieving stable long-term cycling even at a high cutoff voltage of 4.7 V and a high temperature of 45 &#176;C. This work provides a multilevel oxygen-constraining strategy, which can be extended to various layered oxide cathodes involving oxygen release challenges, providing an effective path for the development of high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries.</description>

                Abstract Oxygen electrochemistry, which encompasses the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is of utmost importance in energy&#8208;related reactions such as zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). However, due to their four&#8208;electron transfer process, these reactions are still significantly restricted by sluggish reaction kinetics. Supporting atomically&#8208;dispersed (AD) catalyst or metal nanoparticles (NPs) on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) is proven to be an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of oxygen electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the performance of these types of catalysts still fails to meet the critical requirements for ZABs. Herein, a novel Fe AD Co NPs @NC, which consists of both AD Fe&#8208;N 1 and Fe sites in the Co lattice, is developed. Spectroscopy studies and density functional theory calculations indicate that the Fe site in the Co lattice facilitates the conversion of Co NPs to an amorphous CoOOH, and the Fe&#8208;N 1 serves as the main active site for ORR. Fe AD Co NPs @NC demonstrates remarkable activity for both OER and ORR. When it is used as an air&#8208;electrode for ZABs, it demonstrates a power density of 247.49 mW cm &#8722;2 . This work presents a simple yet efficient method to enhance oxygen electrochemical performance through the synergy between AD sites and metal NPs.</description>

                Implementing a hydrogen economy on an industrial scale poses challenges, particularly in developing cost-effective and stable catalysts for water electrolysis. This study explores the catalytic potential of selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs) synthesized via a simple chemical bath deposition method for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The successful fabrication of Se-NPs on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes has been confirmed using a wide range of analytical tools like X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Importantly, electrochemical measurements revealed superior electrocatalytic activity of the modified Se-NPs/FTO electrodes, with low overpotential (220 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2) and Tafel slope (90.13 mV dec&#8211;1), indicating faster reaction kinetics and reduced energy inputs for oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, the Se-NPs/FTO electrode was employed for PEC water splitting in Na2S electrolyte, showing a notable enhancement in photocurrent density with a difference of 700 &#956;A cm&#8211;2 between light and dark conditions at 1.5 V vs RHE, demonstrating efficient light-driven hydrogen production. The overall findings of this work establish that the proposed Se-NPs/FTO electrodes are promising composites for both electrochemical and PEC performance, thereby providing insights into developing cost-effective catalysts for large-scale water splitting.</description>

      <title>Phase Engineering Facilitates O&#8211;O Coupling via Lattice Oxygen Mechanism for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution on Nickel&#8211;Iron Phosphide</title>

                Nickel&#8211;iron-based catalysts are recognized for their high efficiency in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions, yet the underlying mechanisms that drive their superior performance remain unclear. Herein, we revealed the molecular OER mechanism and the structure-intermediate-performance relationship of OER on a phosphorus-doped nickel&#8211;iron nanocatalyst (NiFeP). NiFeP exhibited exceptional activity and stability with an overpotential of only 210 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 in 1 M KOH and a cell voltage of 1.68 V at 1 A cm&#8211;2 in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers. The evolution of active sites and intermediates during OER on NiFeP was in situ probed and correlated using shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, complemented by differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and density functional theory. These results provide direct evidence that OER proceeds via the lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism. Remarkably, phosphorus doping plays a critical role in stabilizing the active &#946;-Ni(Fe)OOH phase, which facilitates the *OH deprotonation and the subsequent O&#8211;O coupling to form *OO intermediates. Our findings offer a deeper understanding of the OER mechanism, providing a clear pathway for designing next-generation OER catalysts with improved efficiency and durability.</description>

      <title>Tuning Surface State in CoFe (Oxy)Hydroxide for Improved Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>

                CoFe-based catalysts have shown excellent activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with the oxidation states of the active sites playing a crucial role in determining catalytic performance. However, how to effectively increase the oxidation state of these active sites remains a key challenge. In this work, a facile treatment with NaBH4 solution was employed to modulate the surface state of CoFeOxHy catalysts, inducing an enhanced OER activity. The overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for the NaBH4-treated CoFe catalyst was reduced to 270 mV, indicating improved OER activity. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results reveal that NaBH4 treatment induced a phase reconstruction of the CoFe oxalate framework, a critical step in enhancing its catalytic properties. The strong reducing ability of NaBH4 strengthened the Co-Fe interaction, allowing the retention of low-valence Co species while facilitating the formation of high-valence Fe sites. This dual modulation of Co and Fe oxidation states significantly accelerated charge transfer kinetics, ultimately boosting OER performance. These findings highlight the importance of improving the oxidation states of active sites in CoFe-based catalysts, providing insights for developing efficient catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.</description>

                Theoretical studies have revealed the kinetics of oxygen evolution are controlled by the binding energies of reaction intermediates. However, those simulations are based on idealised single crystal structures. Little is known about the catalytically active phases on high surface area catalysts. In this contribution I will show how operando optical spectroscopy of oxygen evolution catalysts can yield (i) site densities (ii) binding energies of intermediates and (iii) turnover frequencies. We reveal the role of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions on state-of-the-art iridium2-4 and cobalt5 based catalysts, including molecular catalysts and oxides. I will correlate electrochemical measurements to operando optical spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry. Density functional theory measurements provide a molecular scale explanation for the observed phenomena. Man, I. C., Su, H. Y., Calle-Vallejo, F., Hansen, H. A., Mart&#237;nez, J. I., Inoglu, N.

                Hydrogen production via water splitting is one of the latest low-cost green hydrogen production technologies. The challenge is to develop inexpensive and highly active catalysts. Herein, we present the preparation of electrocatalysts based on cobalt&#8211;phosphorus (Co-P) coatings with different P contents for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). The Co-P coatings were deposited on the copper (Cu) surface using the economical and simple method of electroless metal deposition. The morphology, structure, and composition of the Co-P coatings deposited on the Cu surface were studied via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), while their activity for HER and OER in 1 M KOH was investigated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chrono-techniques. It was found that the catalyst activity for both HER and OER depends on the P content of the catalyst and varies based on the highest efficiency for each reaction. The Co-P coating with 11 wt% P exhibited the lowest overpotential value of 98.9 mV for the HER to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 compared to the Co-P coatings with 8, 5, 1.6, and 0.4 wt% P (107.6, 165.9, 218.2, and 253.9 mV, respectively). In contrast, the lowest OER overpotential (378 mV) was observed for the Co-P coating with 8 wt% P to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 as compared to the Co-P coatings with 5, 11, 1.6, and 0.4 wt% P (400, 413, 434, and 434 mV, respectively). These results suggest that the obtained catalysts are suitable for HER and OER in alkaline media.</description>

                Bimetallic catalysts have gained attention as promising contenders, owing to the synergistic interaction between two distinct metal centers. In this study, we present two N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene iridium(III) pentamethylcyclopentadienyl complexes [Cp*Ir(fcpyNHC)Cl]PF6 (1) and [Cp*Ir(pyNHC)Cl]PF6 (2) where 1 includes a ferrocene moiety acting as a bimetallic complex. Using ceric ammonium nitrate as a sacrificial oxidant, both complexes were tested for water oxidation. Complex 2 achieved a maximum turnover number (TONmax) of 3240 and a turnover frequency (TOFmax) of 231 min&#8208;1. In comparison, complex 1 demonstrated nearly double the activity with a TONmax of 6047 and TOFmax of 431 min&#8208;1 compared to 2, which was attributed to the cooperative effect of the catalyst in water oxidation reaction. This bimetallic Fe^Ir catalyst (1) exhibited outstanding catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution from water at ambient conditions. We identified a proposed FeIII^IrIV intermediate experimentally via UV&#8208;Vis spectroscopy and XPS study. Theoretically, this intermediate was more stable by 7.84 kcal/mol than the traditional FeII^IrV electromer intermediate. This delineates the pronounced bimetallic cooperative participation of both Fe and Ir metal centres for better activity.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Surface Hydride, Hydrogen Evolution, and Oxygen Reduction on Cu(111)</title>

                Copper is presently the material of choice for hydrogenation reactions converting CO 2 or CO to hydrocarbons and oxygenates although the identity and role of adsorbed reaction intermediates remains unresolved and understudied. Accordingly, the interactions between C, O, H, and molecules comprised thereof, with different Cu surfaces, defects and applied potentials are of substantial interest. This talk will focus on the dynamic interplay between surface hydride formation, hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Cu(111) in perchloric acid electrolyte using electrochemical mass spectrometry (EC-MS). Voltammetric EC-MS unveils a two-stage process for surface hydride formation, with recombination to H 2 occurring at specific potentials. Controlled introduction of O 2 into the cell does not disrupt hydride coverage, while its recombination potential correlates with the transition from mass-transport-limited ORR kinetics to mixed control ORR kinetics. Concurrent ORR accelerates steady-state HER onset, with a sharp increase in transient H 2 production upon potential stepping. Furthermore, convolved voltammetric waves suggest surface restructuring due to O 2 exposure post-ORR. These findings elucidate the complex interactions between surface species and electrochemical behavior, shedding light on Cu's catalytic selectivity and the impact of O 2 on its electrochemical properties.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Effects in Electrocatalysis Studied with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy: The Cases of Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions on Cobalt Ferrite Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202402167</link>
      <description>Alfredo Giner-Requena, Jos&#233; Gracia, Teresa Lana&#8208;Villarreal, Roberto G&#243;mez, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405720879

                Recent years have witnessed an intense effort to unravel magnetic field effects in electrocatalysis, as they can enhance the performance of common electrocatalysts. Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that magnetic fields may affect, among others, the macroscopic spin&#8208;orbital ordering, charge transport, bubble release, and electron transfer kinetics. This paper highlights Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) as a tool to analyze and separate the effects of magnetic field on both the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions at cobalt iron oxide electrodes. The unequivocal existence of magnetic field effects is demonstrated through EIS, which provides additional information useful to individuate the magnetic field effects. In the almost superparamagnetic nanoparticles studied here, while the magnetic field impact is positive for oxygen reduction, it turns out to be negligible in the case of oxygen evolution. In addition, this study reveals new significant insights, including the exceptionally slow relaxation kinetics of the magnetic effects and the significance of magnetic&#8208;induced surface modifications. The fact that the effects virtually disappear in the presence of electrolyte cesium ions points to the key role of electrode surface states. This study showcases the potential of EIS to probe the effects of permanent magnetic fields in electrocatalysis.</description>

      <description>Jala Bib Khan, Pradeep Kumar Panda, Pranjyan Dash, Chien&#8208;Te Hsieh, Chemistry - A European Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405719634

                Nano&#8208;sized high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) recently received more attention to researchers due to their superior electrochemical catalytic properties. HEMs comprise at least five elements with or without metals and are synthesized through solid&#8208;state reactions and solution&#8208;mediated techniques. The presence of many elements in these HEMs result in a high mixing entropy and facilitates the formation of stable solid solutions in fundamental crystal structures. Herein, Pt&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) were synthesized through facile and straightforward pulse microwave (PM) synthesis technique, which serve as efficient electrochemical catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction. The PM synthesis method was conducted at an extremely low temperature (100 &#176;C) without any external catalytic reagents. Using this PM technique, Cr18.2Zr13.5Ti5.3Co17.8Ni8.4Cu8.5Fe28.3 and Al15.3Mn18.2Ti3.7Co23.2Ni5.9Cu5.9Fe27.8 HEAs catalysts were synthesized with superior catalytic activity towards OER and ORR and compare its activities with pure Pt catalysts. The as&#8208;prepared HEAs also display an anti&#8208;CO poisoning effect and long&#8208;term durability, as compared to pure Pt catalysts. The low&#8208;temperature PM approach not only confirms the feasibility of synthesis of noble metal&#8208;free HEAs but also validates their superior catalytic activity towards OER and ORR, which is beneficial for the development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.</description>

                Unbearable to the high catalytic potentials, most materials undergo either reversible or irreversible structural reconstruction during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis, involving valence changes as well as coordination alternation of both metal and oxygen active sites. Such potential-dependent evolution happening on the local surface brings about certain challenges but also necessity to explore in-situ structure-performance relations. However, corresponding researches prove intractable to reach a consensus due to universally undeveloped operando characterization techniques.</description>

      <title>Construction of Heterostructured Ni3S2@V-NiFe(III) LDH for Enhanced OER Performance</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules29246018</link>
      <description>Qianqian Dong, Qijun Zhong, Jie Zhou, Yuhao Li, Yujing Wang, Jiayang Cai, Shuangwei Yu, Xiong He, Shaohui Zhang, Molecules. 29(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405644289

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), which involves a four-electron transfer and slow kinetics, requires an efficient catalyst to overcome the high energy barrier for high-performance water electrolysis. In this paper, a novel Ni3S2@V-NiFe(III) LDH/NF catalyst was prepared via a facile two-step hydrothermal method. The constructed heterostructure of Ni3S2@V-NiFe(III) LDH increases the specific surface area and regulates the electronic structure. Furthermore, the introduction of the V element forms an electron transport chain of Ni-O-Fe-O-V-O-Ni, which optimizes the binding energy between metal active sites and oxygen evolution reaction intermediates, accelerates electron transfer, and improves self-reconstruction. With this dual regulation strategy, Ni3S2@V-NiFe(III) LDH/NF exhibits exceptional OER performance with an overpotential of 280 mV at 100 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 45.4 mV/dec. This work develops a dual regulation strategy combining heterostructure formation and the doping effect, which are beneficial in the design of efficient OER catalysts.</description>

                Photoelectrochemistry is used to develop solar energy technologies for fuel production and chemical transformations. Semiconductor materials such as TiO 2 , WO 3 , BiVO 4 , Fe 2 O 3 , and Cu 2 O are often investigated in devices designed to convert light energy into chemical energy, including for the production of hydrogen by photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The oxide electrodes are of significant interest due to their potential for efficient PEC reactions with high durability and their relatively low costs compared to other semiconductor materials. This presentation provides an overview of recent advancements in gas-fed PEC systems specifically designed for utilizing water vapor as a hydrogen resource. The gas-fed PEC system utilizes a proton exchange membrane (PEM) as a solid polymer electrolyte. Additionally, it utilizes gas-diffusion photoelectrodes composed of a fibrous conductive substrate with macroporous structures and semiconductor oxide particles. Herein, the porous photoelectrodes are composed of n-type oxides for oxygen evolution reactions and used with a Pt electrocatalyst cathode for hydrogen evolution reactions. The topics covered include the conceptual framework of vapor-fed PEC hydrogen production, the strategic design of gas-phase PEC reaction interfaces, and the development of porous photoanodes for an oxygen evolution reaction. A significant enhancement in the PEC efficiency was achieved through the application of a thin proton-conducting ionomer film on these porous photoelectrodes for surface functionalization. The rational design of proton exchange membrane-based PEC cells will play a pivotal role in realizing renewable-energy-driven hydrogen production from atmospheric humidity in the air.

                Mechanistic understanding of how electrode-electrolyte interfaces evolve dynamically is crucial for advancing water-electrolysis technology, especially the restructuring of catalyst surface during complex electrocatalytic reactions. However, for perovskite fluorides, the mechanistic exploration for the influence of the dynamic restructuring on their chemical property and catalytic mechanism is unclear due to their poor conductivity that makes the definition of electrocatalyst structure difficult.

      <title>Sequential Generation of Hydrogen and Oxygen By Water Electrolysis Using Iodine Redox</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02493517mtgabs</link>
      <description>A. Tang Kai, Mai Tomisaki, Hiroshige Matsumoto, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-02(49)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405641528

                Introduction In a hydrogen-centric society, hydrogen production via water electrolysis plays a crucial role 1 . Conventional water electrolysis generates hydrogen and oxygen simultaneously, necessitating a separation mechanism to prevent purity reduction and explosion risks induced by gas mixing. This study aims to selectively generate hydrogen and oxygen sequentially in two steps by utilizing the redox reaction between iodide and iodate ions. Specifically, exploiting the lower oxidation potential of iodide ions compared to the oxygen evolution potential, hydrogen is generated during the first step alongside the oxidation of iodide ions. Utilizing the lower reduction potential of iodate ions compared to the hydrogen evolution potential, oxygen is generated during the second step alongside the reduction of iodate ions. This presentation reports the results of investigating the feasibility of generating hydrogen and oxygen based on this principle. Experimental A two-compartment cell separated by a Nafion membrane was employed as the electrolysis cell. Platinum electrodes were used as the working and counter electrodes, and Ag/AgCl served as the reference electrode. Potentials were expressed relative to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) which was converted from the measured potential ( vs. Ag/AgCl) by the following equation: E RHE = E Ag/AgCl + 0.198 + 0.059 pH (V) 2 . Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements were conducted at each step to observe the current-potential characteristics and to determine at which potential only iodide ions and iodate ions react. In the first step, the anode was filled with 10 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM KI aqueous solutions (in 100 mM KOH), while the cathode was filled with 100 mM KOH aqueous solution. In the second step, the cathode was filled with 10 mM, 50 mM, and 100 mM KIO 3 aqueous solutions (in 100 mM KOH), while the anode was filled with 100 mM KOH aqueous solution. Control experiments using 100 mM KOH aqueous solution in both compartments were conducted for comparison with two-step water electrolysis. Constant potential electrolysis was performed at the potentials determined from LSV measurements, and the reactants and products were analyzed using a gas chromatography and a high-performance liquid chromatography to examine current efficiency. All electrochemical experiments were conducted at room temperature. Results and Discussion LSV measurements in the first step revealed a peak of oxidation current between +1.4 V and +2.0 V, increasing with the initial concentration of iodide ions. Comparison with control experiments indicated that this oxidation potential was lower than that of oxygen evolution reaction. Hence, under conditions where iodide ions are contained in the anolyte, oxidation of iodide ions occur at a lower potential than oxygen evolution reaction. In the second step, a peak of reduction current appeared between +0.2 V and &#8211;0.6 V, increasing with the initial concentration of iodate ions. Comparison with control experiments suggested that the reduction reaction of iodate ions occurred at a lower potential than hydrogen evolution reaction. Utilizing the identified potentials which iodine redox reactions selectively occur, constant potential electrolysis revealed iodate ions being generated at the anode in the first step and iodide ions being generated at the cathode in the second step. It was found that the maximum current efficiency for the oxidation reaction of iodide ions was 98% at +1.9 V in the first step, while the maximum current efficiency for the reduction reaction of iodate ions was almost 100% at +0.1 V in the second step. These results confirmed the feasibility of water electrolysis using iodine redox reactions, with desired reactions occurring efficiently.

                Solid Oxide Cells, SOFC and SOEC, are attracting attention in energy conversion and storage systems due to their high efficiency and flexibility in various fuels. However, their performance is decreased by the limited reversibility of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the air electrode, particularly at intermediate temperatures because of high overpotential from large activation energy. Therefore, developing an active and reversible air electrode for fast oxygen dissociation/association processes is crucially required. Conventional air electrodes often utilize Co-based perovskites (such as La 0.6 Sr 0.4 Co 0.2 Fe 0.8 O 3&#8722;&#948; and Ba 0.5 Sr 0.5 Co 0.8 Fe 0.2 O 3&#8722;&#948; ) due to their high ionic and electronic conductivity, along with good catalytic activity. However, it has been observed that the presence of A-site oxide on the perovskite surface leads to lower catalytic activity. Recent approaches have explored surface modification through infiltration to enhance catalytic activity and stability [1-3]. This study focuses on investigating the cathodic performance of surface-modified B-site oxide, specifically Co 3 O 4 spinel-type oxide, as a model catalyst with SrO modification. Figure 1 illustrates the image of the air electrode aimed in this study. It was found that the power density of the cells in SOFC condition increased after Sr infiltration, which is almost the same performance with SrCoO 3 reference cell. Additionally, overpotential was significantly decreased due to the formation of active sites for ORR. For SOEC condition, Sr infiltrated cell reached a reasonable current density compared with bare Co 3 O 4 . Also, ohmic and polarization resistances decreased because of better oxygen evolution on the surface. It is found that interface between SrO and Co 3 O 4 is active site for air electrode of solid oxide reversible cell, which is demonstrated by using diffusion of oxygen tracer, 18 O. References [1] A.

                Spinel oxides are promising multifunctional electrocatalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant elements. While NiFe 2 O 4 and CoFe 2 O 4 have been widely studied for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), CuFe 2 O 4 has been less investigated. Herein, cubic CuFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles are synthetic using a microwave&#8208;assisted approach. The effect of post&#8208;synthetic calcination on particle morphology, crystal structure, and inherent properties such as optical bandgap, magnetic moment, or degree of inversion is investigated. The influence of the post&#8208;synthetic treatment on the electrochemical performance is then evaluated. It is found that higher calcination temperatures are beneficial for the OER, the hydrogen evolution reaction, and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which can be explained by an improved crystallinity, removal of organic surface residues and changes in the dominant crystal phase&#8212;and relatedly the conductivity. Especially for the ORR activity, an increase in the electrochemical active surface area and a decrease in the charge transfer resistance upon calcination are important prerequisites. The activity of CuFe 2 O 4 for the reduction of CO 2 to CO, in contrast, is mainly determined by the local environment of Cu 2+ and is best at a comparatively high degree of inversion and low amounts of organic residues and for particles with a cubic structure.</description>

                The research and improvement of electrocatalysts are crucial for lowering the energy barrier of water-splitting electrocatalytic reactions and enhancing reaction kinetics. To achieve this, the development of low-cost, high-performance electrocatalysts with broad application potential is urgent. In this study, The ZnCo 2 O 4 @Co 3 O 4 hybrid-structure nanowires were successfully synthesized using a hydrothermal method. As electrocatalysts for water splitting, ZnCo 2 O 4 @Co 3 O 4 achieves a current density of 20 mA cm &#8722;2 with an overpotential of 388.6 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and an overpotential of 92.4 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), demonstrating superior catalytic performance compared to single ZnCo 2 O 4 or Co 3 O 4 . Additionally, the ZnCo 2 O 4 @Co 3 O 4 sample exhibits a cell voltage of 1.747 V and maintains excellent stability in tests lasting over 25 hours.</description>

                Microsensors for resolving local pH are versatile analytical tools for studying reactions at solid-liquid interfaces in applications such as electrocatalysis and corrosion. However, the achievable temporal resolution is limited, hindering the operando investigation of local pH at surfaces in electrochemical reactions. Here, we present a methodology to achieve a high time resolution by deploying AC voltammetry with a pH microsensor. The sensor is composed of a gold ultramicroelectrode functionalized with electropolymerized methylene blue at its tip, allowing for continuous monitoring of pH in aqueous solutions in the neutral and acidic regime at a subsecond time resolution. As a proof-of-principle, we show that our sensors can be used for detecting interfacial pH at an electrified platinum nanoparticle-modified carbon electrode during the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The fast pH sensing capability is expected to open an avenue for routine operando studies of local pH at electrified interfaces.</description>

                The interaction between interfacial water and metal oxides represents an important first step in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). RuO 2 is a well-known OER electrocatalyst; however, its active state remains elusive. We will discuss an atomic force microscopy (AFM) investigation on the RuO 2 (110) surface held at various potentials. We use this result to study how RuO 2 surfaces change during OER. We further image water dissociation into OH* (* denotes adsorbed species) and O* species. Starting from surface-bound water, which manifests as a row of surface-bound molecules, increasing the oxidative potential transforms these adsorbates into OH* and O*. This oxidative step also changes the pattern of the surface-bound molecules. We use these results to map the surface phase diagram of RuO 2 (110) and provide an interpretation of its cyclic voltammetry.</description>

                Abstract Oxygen electrocatalysis plays a pivotal role in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries, which hold immense potential for energy conversion and storage systems due to their superior theoretical energy density, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and safety profile. However, carbon&#8208;based materials in air electrode face challenges stemming from the harsh oxidative environment of oxygen catalysis, leading to thermodynamic instability. This underscores the urgent necessity for the development of effective carbon anti&#8208;oxidation strategies. This comprehensive review initially explores the complex mechanisms underlying the oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER) and the prevalent issue of carbon corrosion in carbon&#8208;based materials. It then delves into diverse strategies aimed at mitigating catalyst corrosion through doped carbons, encompassing techniques such as graphitization, active site management, surface modification using functional groups, and corrosion resistance coating. Moreover, the review discusses methods to counteract carbon oxidation in catalyst supports, including the utilization of novel carbons, highly active catalysts to minimize oxidation, and the exploration of non&#8208;carbon alternatives. Furthermore, the review also sheds light on protecting current collectors and conductive additives within the air electrode from corrosion. Ultimately, it outlines emerging challenges and opportunities for addressing carbon oxidation in air electrode, paving the way for enhanced performance and longevity in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries.</description>

      <title>Atomically Dispersed Transition Metal Catalysts for Electrochemical Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02493516mtgabs</link>

                Chlorine evolution reaction (CER) is a crucial anodic reaction in the chlor&#8211;alkali process. For 50 years, dimensionally stable anode (DSA) has been extensively used for CER. However, the DSA requires about 30 at% of precious metals, such as iridium and ruthenium, and also catalyzes oxygen evolution reaction as a parasitic reaction, invoking the cost and selectivity issues, respectively. In this work, we have synthesized atomically dispersed non-precious metal (M; M = Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu)-based CER catalysts to unravel their CER catalytic trends. The catalysts were synthesized by coating carbon nanotube (CNT) with polyaniline layers, adsorption of a metal precursor, silica layer overcoating, thermal annealing, followed by silica layer etching. The resulting M 1 /aniCNT catalysts showed over 90% CER selectivity. Among the catalysts, Ni 1 /aniCNT exhibited the best CER activity, surpassing that of DSA. The high CER activity of Ni 1 /aniCNT is attributed to the asymmetric Ni&#8211;N 3 structure with Ni 1+ oxidation state. This work highlights the dependency of activity on the structure of atomically dispersed catalysts and broadens the range of CER catalysts.</description>

                Abstract Transition metal hydroxides (TMHs), comprising metal-centered polyhedra, are abundant in nature and have a broad range of applications. Although the intercalation/deintercalation of polyhedra with unconventional coordination number (UCN) plays a pivotal role in their formation process and influences their chemical behavior, the detailed mechanism remains obscure. Here, by combining kinetically controlled growth of Co(OH)2 as a model system (where polyhedra with UCN refer to 4-coordinated tetrahedra), in situ pH measurement, and in situ ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, we tracked Co2+ tetrahedral intercalation/deintercalation with varying OH&#8722; concentration, discovering that the initial Co2+ tetrahedral intercalation into the Co(OH)2 lattice is inevitable and its retention is influenced by the effective OH&#8722; concentration, challenging previous beliefs about the formation of Co(OH)2 and potentially other hydroxides. More importantly, understanding the intercalation mechanism significantly contributes to optimizing the synthesis conditions of hydroxides with tunable coordination environments, which hold significant application potential, as evidenced by a proof of concept application in the oxygen evolution reaction.</description>

                This study explores the influence of Fe ion incorporation on the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, utilizing CuO-based materials. Instead of developing an efficient and stable OER catalyst, this research investigates two distinct CuO variants: one with Fe ions adhered to the surface and another with Fe ions integrated into the CuO lattice. By employing a variety of analytical techniques, the study demonstrates that the CuO variant with surface-bound Fe ions (referred to as compound 1) exhibits significantly enhanced OER performance compared to the variant with internally embedded Fe ions (referred to as compound 2). The Tafel plots obtained from multistep amperometry profiles for compounds 1 and 2, as well as pure CuO and FeO(OH), exhibit linear relationships in the log(j) vs overpotential plot, with Tafel slopes of 39.3, 41.5, 115.9, and 121.9 mV/decade, respectively. These Tafel slopes indicate that compounds 1 and 2 likely share a similar reaction mechanism, whereas CuO and FeO(OH) appear to follow distinct mechanisms. At 570 mV overpotential, the turnover frequencies of Fe ions for compounds 1 and 2, as well as for FeO(OH), calculated from electrode compositions and chronoamperometry data, are found to be 1.1, 0.2, and 5.7 &#215; 10</description>

                Photoelectrochemistry holds the promise of directly converting sunlight to valuable chemical products since its birth over 50 years ago. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) methods, however, lag behind their electrochemical (EC) counterparts (which can be powered by a solar photovoltaic (PV) power source) in terms of current density, by orders of magnitude. In this work, we demonstrate that by integrating the recent achievements of the PV and EC communities (in terms of using concentrated sunlight and gas diffusion electrodes, respectively), we can achieve current densities similar to EC methods, but with lower energy input. Specifically, in this proof-of-concept study, we combined the direct PEC oxidation of glycerol (on a NiOOH co-catalyst-coated n-Si photoanode) with the dark hydrogen evolution (HER) or CO2 reduction (CO2R) in an anion exchange membrane (AEM) separated continuous-flow PEC cell. We achieved over 110 mA cm&#8211;2 photocurrent density under 10 Sun irradiation, which is at least an order of magnitude larger than those typically reported in the literature, for any of these PEC half reactions. We demonstrated that the product distribution of glycerol oxidation is notably different in PEC and EC scenarios at the same current density, and the parasitic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) can be suppressed in the PEC case. This approach raises new opportunities to drive electrochemical reactions with complex reaction pathways in a more selective manner even at high current densities. In the second part of my talk I will demonstrate the effect of the co-catalyst properties in tailoring the product distribution.</description>

                The electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (CO2eRR) to high value-added chemicals in an aqueous electrolyte usually faces challenges, including sluggish oxygen evolution at the anode and the competing reaction of hydrogen evolution at the cathode. A novel CoNi@NC composite with high saturation magnetization, prepared by facile pyrolysis, was used as the cathode and a Pt sheet as the anode in an ionic liquid (IL)-methanol electrolyte to conduct the CO2eRR to produce CH4 and CO, and oxidation of methanol to generate methylal (dimethoxymethane, DMM). A magnetic CoNi alloy nanomaterial (CoNi@NC) with a nitrogen-doped carbon layer-coated structure was synthesized by a one-pot method. The system achieved an associative strategy for synchronous production of high-valued chemicals via two half-reactions at the cathode and anode, respectively. The optimal CoNi@NC composite exhibited efficient catalytic activity, obtaining an average of 54.5% faradaic efficiency (FE) for DMM within 48 h and 91.9% of momentary FE for CO and CH4 at 24 h under lower energy consumption. The electrode catalyst and ionic liquid electrolyte also exhibited good recyclability and stability in the CO2eRR. Mechanism studies indicated that magnetic CoNi alloy species served as adsorption and active sites for CO2 conversion. In addition, the carbon layer coating enhanced the stability of the CoNi alloy, and N-doping introduced surface defects on the carbon layer, thereby promoting CO2 adsorption and electrocatalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the magnetic CoNi (1 1 1) species was conducive to CO2 adsorption and activation, exhibiting high selectivity for the CO2eRR.</description>

                Metal oxides such as TiO 2 are widely used as electrocatalysts and photo-responsive electrodes in various electrochemical devices, and many researchers have studied them. However, the reaction processes at their interfaces are generally complex, and there are many aspects that remain to be elucidated. Even for TiO 2 electrodes, which have been the most widely studied, the mechanism of interfacial reactions still remains unclear, especially the effects of crystal faces and atomic- to nano-level surface structures on electrode reactions. Our group has been investigated how the atomic- to nano-level structure of the TiO2 electrode surface affects the reaction at the TiO 2 electrode interface. In our previous study, we revealed that the water photooxidation reaction (i.e. oxygen evolution reaction) on TiO 2 surface accompanies with other three kinds of side reactions (photoluminescence (PL), surface roughening and non-radiative recombination) [1]. These reactions are competitive with each other and the ratio of their quantum efficiencies strongly depends on the atomic-scale surface local structure. Thus, we investigated the surface local structure dependence of those competitive reactions on TiO 2 surface using atomically flat TiO 2 (rutile) single crystal electrode those step-terrace structure was strictly controlled. It was revealed that the ratio of the quantum efficiency of four kinds of reactions strongly depends on the surface local structure such as step-terrace structure. On the other hand, the surface roughening process, which is one of the four competitive reactions, induced the drastic change of the surface local structure and also induced the change in the ratio of quantum efficiency of four kinds of competitive reactions, leading to the increase of the photocatalytic activity for oxygen photoevolution [2]. Such an investigation would be very important because some recent studies indicate that the surface local structure changes during the photooxidation process even in the case of practical catalyst. We also investigated the influence of nanostructure formed on the TiO 2 electrode on the branch ratio of 4 competitive photooxidation reactions. We found that the overvoltage for O 2 evolution on nanostructured electrode was decreased comparing with that on atomically flat (100) surface. We can explain these results by the spatial configuration of edge and facet sites which depends on the surface nanostructure. The organic synthesis by using of photooxidation reaction on photocatalysis has been investigated by many researchers. Although the formation of phenol from benzene on TiO 2 surface by photo-induced oxidation reaction is one of the representative reactions, its molecular mechanism is still unclear. We can assumed that the quantum efficiencies of phenol generation depends on the atomic-scale surface local structure. We investigated the atomic leveled surface local structure dependence of the efficiency of photooxidation reaction of benzene (in HClO 4aq solution) on Nb-doped rutile TiO 2 (110) single crystal electrode. It was found that the efficiency of the photooxidation reaction of benzene is largely affected by the step structure on the TiO 2 surface [3]. Detailed analysis of the dependence on surface structure revealed that the photooxidation reaction of benzene and the photoinduced decomposition of water (Oxygen evolution reaction) proceed competitively via the same intermediate, and that the ratio of their efficiencies is strongly affected by the step direction and step density.

                INTRODUCTION The quest for sustainable and efficient hydrogen production has led to the exploration of various catalyst materials for seawater electrolysis, a promising avenue for renewable energy generation. Seawater, abundant and accessible, offers a compelling resource for electrolytic hydrogen production, but its high salinity and corrosive nature pose challenges for catalyst stability and performance. The development of efficient catalysts capable of withstanding the harsh conditions of seawater while achieving high oxygen evolution efficiency (OEE) has captured the attention of researchers in this field. The development of high activity/high stability/low-cost oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts for large-scale production is an important issue for academia and the industry today [1]. Although RuO 2 and IrO 2 noble metal oxides are considered the most efficient OER electrocatalysts, their high costs, apparent scarcity, and low stability have greatly impeded their large-scale application as OER electrocatalysts [2]. In recent years, manganese, cobalt, molybdenum and other transition metals have emerged as promising candidates for catalyzing the OER in seawater electrolysis applications. Cobalt oxide electrodes are well-known for their catalytic activity towards the OER and stability in alkaline medium specially when it modified with other transition metals such as Mo [3]. Some researchers use manganese as anodic catalysts for oxygen evolution from seawater or MnO 2 decorated with Co 3 O 4 yields the best performances in alkaline seawater splitting [4]. Also, these electrodes were applied on FTO surface in acid medium [5]. We consider testing cobalt (Co) and Co mixed with molybdenum are important challenge in acidic medium under high current density. The present work aimed to (i) determine the optimum conditions for production of durable Co/Ti and Co-Mo/Ti anodes using a fast and easy fabricated method. (ii) focus on durability test of these electrodes under high current density without using intermediate conductive layer (iii) comparative analysis involves evaluating various aspects including catalytic activity, stability, structural properties, and OEE. EXPERIMENTAL First, the titanium substrate underwent a treatment for surface roughening. Subsequently, the treated titanium substrate was coated with cobalt oxide (Co 3 O 4 ) through the calcination of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O) dissolved in a butanol solution, which was then brushed onto the substrate. Using the same method, a Co-Mo oxide was also prepared by calcinating butanol solutions of Co(NO 3 ) 2 .6H 2 O and molybdenum chloride (MoCl 5 ) at 450&#176;C. The fabricated electrodes were characterized by XRD and EPMA to examine the structural and elemental properties of these electrodes. Moreover, electrochemical testing was conducted to evaluate the catalytic activity and stability of the electrodes during seawater electrolysis. The performance of the electrode was examined by electrolysis of 0.5 M NaCl solution at 1000Am -2 . The OEE was estimated by the difference between the total charge passed during electrolysis and the formation charge of chlorine analyzed by iodometric titration. Polarization curves were measured using multi electrochemical measurement system. Correction for iR drop was made with a current-interruption technique. Durability test was measured using DC power supply 30V/5A. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION This study compares the performance of cobalt oxide electrodes, a well-established material for seawater electrolysis, with cobalt-molybdenum oxide composite electrodes. SEM images show the mesoporous structure for Ti/Co-Mo electrodes which is suitable for various applications (Fig. 1). X-ray diffraction clarified that all fabricated electrode consisted of free Co 3 O 4 on Ti plate and cobalt molybdenum oxide composite on Ti plate. EPMA indicate that the samples contain Co, Ti, O and/or Mo for the modified electrode. Polarization curves and OEE analysis indicate that incorporating Mo to Co electrode enhances efficiency and reduces resistance. Additionally, the resulting electrode composition exhibits a porous structure expecting high performance in electrolysis. Mo addition led to a decrease in polarization potential, and the analysis of polarization curves showed that Mo addition increased the specific conductivity of the oxide. The value of the OEE is 18.98% for Co-Mo electrode compared to 13.15% for only Co electrode. Durability tests were conducted to evaluate the stability of both electrodes at a current density of 1000 A/m&#178; over an extended period. The results indicate that the Co-Mo electrode exhibits inferior stability for two weeks and higher OEE compared to Co electrode under the same operating conditions.

                CO 2 reduction is an important step in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). The utilization of a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) with a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) realizes high current density CO 2 reduction. However, most of the developed CO 2 reduction catalysts suffer from low Faradaic efficiency when using a proton exchange membrane MEA, due to low local pH surrounding catalysts. Alternatively, with an anion exchange membrane MEA, CO 2 reduction suffers from low conversion efficiency due to carbonate-bicarbonate crossover through the membrane to the anode. For continuously-running CO 2 electrolyzers, the crossover of acids and cations results in low reduction efficiency and flooding of the GDE. We have designed and characterized an asymmetric membrane that prohibits carbonate-bicarbonate crossover, yet can maintain a high local pH surrounding the catalyst. The resulting MEA can achieve high Faradaic efficiency toward CO 2 reduction using developed catalysts with near-zero CO 2 crossover. When using oxygen evolution in the anode, we further developed an ion-blockage strategy to diminish the crossover of acids or cations during long-term operation, maintaining a relatively stable and suitable environment for CO 2 reduction on GDE. The crossover management of carbonate, bicarbonate, protons and cations can lead to a long lifetime high-efficiency CO 2 electrolyzer.</description>

      <title>Near Real-Time Evaluation of Hydroxyl Radical Generation on Photocatalytic Electrodes Using Flow-Type Electron Spin Resonance Method</title>

                Tungsten trioxide (WO 3 ) and titanium oxide are known as photocatalysts that oxidize and decompose organic compounds. Hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) generated during water oxidation not only decompose organic substances but also cause other selective oxidation reactions. However, the behavior of &#8226;OH production under different reaction conditions is not completely understood. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively analyze the &#8226;OH generated during the photoanodic reaction on photocatalyst electrodes. Herein, we developed a novel electrolyte flow-type electron spin resonance (ESR) method using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N -oxide (DMPO) as a spin-trapping agent to analyze the Faraday efficiency of &#8226;OH production in near real-time response. The WO 3 photoanode was prepared by a dip coating method using Ti felt as the conductive substrate. When the WO 3 electrode was irradiated with ultraviolet light at 1.2 V vs. RHE, four ESR signals were observed, and the formation of &#8226;OH (&#8226;DMPO-OH) was confirmed from the g value and hyperfine coupling constant. The amount of &#8226;OH produced was quantified every minute by comparing the double-integrated intensity of this signal with that of a standard sample. The results showed that the Faraday efficiency of the total amount of &#8226;OH in WO 3 was low, less than 1%, and most of the photocurrent was used for oxygen evolution reaction. In the presentation, we will also report on the dependence of &#8226;OH formation on applied potential and incident light intensity. Figure 1</description>

                Rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZAB) are a promising energy storage solution due to their low cost, low toxicity and high theoretical energy density. However, conventional alkaline ZABs face challenges such as CO2 absorption, zinc corrosion, and poor cycle stability. To address these issues, non&#8208;alkaline near&#8208;neutral electrolytes offer potential benefits, but they also present slower kinetics, especially during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the cell charge. This study investigates the use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce Ru&#8208;based Nano&#8208;sites onto carbon cathodes to enhance catalytic activity in non&#8208;alkaline ZABs. The catalytic performance of these ALD&#8208;treated materials was evaluated in ZABs with 1M Zn(OAc)2 and 1M ZnSO4 electrolytes. ALD&#8208;treated Ru catalysts significantly lower the OER overpotentials, improving charging capacity and stability of the battery compared to pristine carbon and benchmark RuO2/C samples with a similar content of ruthenium. We also find that with the Ru&#8208;based catalyst, OER proceeds exclusively through the four&#8208;electron pathway, in contrast to a mixture of two&#8208; and four&#8208;electron mechanisms observed for the pristine carbon. Our findings show, using a model catalytical system, that non&#8208;alkaline based ZABs can be realized through cathode engineering, and that the reaction mechanism on the cathode is highly dependent on its catalytic properties.</description>

                Developing low-cost and highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts using earth-abundant elements through simple and efficient synthesis methods holds paramount importance for sustainable hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Porous catalyst materials have proven versatile in heterogeneous catalysis due to their high surface area and fast mass diffusion. Herein, we developed a simple and sustainable approach for synthesizing high-surface-area, porous Co3O4 nanomaterials from perovskite materials, i.e., SrCoO3 and LaCoO3. The resulting porous Co3O4 nanomaterials exhibit exceptional efficiency in the water oxidation reaction. Notably, the acid-treated sample (AT-SCO-1M) demonstrated superior photochemical and electrochemical activities. It exhibits a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 8.13 &#215; 10&#8211;3 s&#8211;1, along with a lower overpotential (375 mV) and Tafel slope (117 mV/dec) compared to the untreated Cg-Co3O4 nanoparticles (4.28 &#215; 10&#8211;3 s&#8211;1, 465 mV, and 220 mV/dec). This method's selective removal of A-site cations from the perovskite precursors increases the catalyst surface area, porosity, and hydrophilicity, all collectively contributing to improved water oxidation activity. Our sustainable approach for synthesizing high-surface-area, porous nanomaterials through a simple, environmental, and recyclable method shows a new way to design highly active water oxidation catalysts and other catalytic applications.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Mechanism of Nickel-Mediated Electrochemical Alcohol Oxidation Using in-Situ X-Ray Absorption Spectroscopy and Microkinetic Modeling</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02563759mtgabs</link>

                Electrochemical alcohol oxidation (AOR) is an attractive replacement for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in hydrogen production. Compared to OER, AOR has a lower thermodynamic potential and produces higher value products. Nickel-mediated AOR has been proposed to proceed through a chemical, redox pathway preferred by aldehydes (geminal diols in alkaline electrolyte), and a potential dependent pathway preferred by alcohols. The precise mechanism of these reactions and their effects on the material are not well understood. Using furfural and furfuryl alcohol as model molecules, we elucidate the mechanism of nickel-mediated AOR. In-situ tracking of the Ni K edge using x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) reveals nickel is at a more reduced state during AOR compared to when no organic reactant is present. The nickel oxidation state profile, however, varies depending on the reactant present (furfural vs. furfuryl alcohol). Product analysis shows that competition for catalytic sites with OER at high potential could contribute to these differences. Microkinetic modeling explores the potential dependence of the Ni K edge position by studying the interplay between the rate of electrochemical nickel oxidation and its chemical reduction through reaction with alcohol. Understanding this relationship will identify rate-limiting steps and active (and inactive) phases for AOR. Insights from this model system will motivate novel guidelines for AOR catalyst design.</description>

      <title>(Invited) Design of Durable OER Catalyst for Water Splitting</title>

                Developing durable catalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is critical for advancing the hydrogen economy. Here, we reported OER catalyst based on cobalt spinel oxide with ultrahigh activity and remarkable durability for the acidic OER. Specifically, the as-prepared NiCo 2 O 4 displayed a low overpotential of 310 mV at 10 mA/cm 2 in 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 , respectively. More importantly, at a high current density of 100 mA/cm 2 , NiCo 2 O 4 also delivered a low overpotential of 395 mV and a high mass stability of 384 h/mg, demonstrating its exceptional durability. Furthermore, as X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies revealed that Ni mainly occupied the octahedral site in the NiCo 2 O 4 spinel structure. With Ni in the lattice, the structural integrity was maintained during the OER, which led to its outstanding durability. Density functional theory calculations showed that the acidic OER on the NiCo 2 O 4 spinel structure underwent a direct O-O coupling mechanism on the (001) facet rather than the traditional adsorbate evolution mechanism. Our calculation demonstrated that the metal vacancy formation is significantly suppressed with Ni in the structure. Ni can also prevent surface electronic relaxation during the OER cycles, consistent with the superior durability provided by NiCo 2 O 4 . This study demonstrated a promising and cost-effective approach to producing nickel cobalt spinel oxides with outstanding acidic OER performance. The markedly improved OER activity and durability in acidic media promise an attractive catalyst material for proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers and renewable chemical fuel generation.</description>

      <title>Optical and Electrochemical Effects of Semiconductor Nanoparticle Clustering on Photocatalytic Water Splitting Half-Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02594029mtgabs</link>
      <description>Rebecca Lentz, Rohini Bala Chandran, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-02(59)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405640554

                To meet increasing demands for carbon-reduction, renewable and low-emission fuel alternatives have been proposed as a replacement for carbon-intense natural gas and coal. Specifically, hydrogen and oxygen evolution have been demonstrated at the lab-scale through a room temperature water-splitting process using only water, sunlight, and suspended semiconductor nanoparticles as inputs. Recent advancements in improving the efficiency of this water-splitting process focus on methods to boost charge separation, chemical selectivity, and optical band-engineering. However, there is a growing need for demonstrations at scale that also consider nano-particle interactions as an ensemble. Additionally, Z-scheme reactor designs have motivated the study of oxidation and reduction half-reactions using charge-carrying ions as an intermediary. This work studies how photocatalytic rates of half-reactions driven by semiconductor nano-particle suspension are affected by the inevitable presence of aggregation and agglomeration. The effects of solution pH, Fe(III) concentration, input light intensity, reaction temperature, stirring and sonication, nanoparticle concentration and size, and material quality are experimentally characterized by the desired ion evolution reaction rates and external quantum yield. Additionally, the effects of these variables on the zeta potential, optical scattering, particle aggregation, and mass transport are also experimentally measured to probe ensemble behavior and nano-particle interactions. Results indicate the importance of balancing ion concentration and pH to reduce aggregation via enhanced zeta potential nanoparticle repulsion, while also avoiding competitive absorption from suspended intermediary ions and their respective pH-dependent hydrolysis states. Reaction modeling further motivates investigation into charge-transfer limitations and enhancements due to aggregation states that cannot be explained by optical effects alone.</description>

      <title>Efficient Production of Hypochlorite in Water Using Boron-Doped Diamond Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02583914mtgabs</link>
      <description>Yuuri Tsuji, Andrea Fiorani, Yasuaki Einaga, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-02(58)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405641318

                Hypochlorite (OCl - ) has various uses such as wastewater treatment, sterilization, and bleaching. Generally, OCl - (in basic condition, NaOCl) is produced by dissolving Cl 2 gas into aqueous NaOH. Cl 2 gas has intrinsic problems of carry, storage, and safety use because of its toxicity, and it is desirable to avoid using Cl 2 gas. Electrolysis of a NaCl aqueous solution is one of the methods to produce OCl - from the oxidation of the chloride ion without using Cl 2 gas. However, there is a problem of selectivity because the reaction potentials between O 2 evolution and OCl - production are close. Also, Cl - can cause electrodes corrosion. To overcome these problems encountered in the ClO - production, we focus our attention on boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes which have low electrocatalytic activity for water oxidation to O 2 , combined with high physical and chemical stability. BDD electrodes are prepared by microwave plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD), introducing H 2 gas for the plasma, in combination with CH 3 COCH 3 and B(OCH 3 ) 3 as source of carbon and boron, respectively. The electrolytic solutions were 0.5 M NaCl at pH 11 (in mixed 0.1 M Na 3 PO 4 and Na 2 HPO 4 ) and at pH 14 (in 1 M NaOH). Electrolysis was performed for 1 hour by chronoamperometry (CA) using 1% BDD as the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) as the reference electrode. To optimize the conditions, electrolysis of NaCl solution was performed in various conditions, such as pH, applied potentials, and electrolyte salts. The solutions at each pH were prepared with phosphate buffer and NaOH. To detect and quantify the produced OCl - , UV-vis spectra were measured, which show a peak at 292 nm for OCl - . The amount of OCl - produced after the electrolysis was quantified according to the calibration curve of absorption vs OCl - concentration, furthermore the faradaic efficiency was calculated. To compare the efficiency, selectivity, and stability with other standard electrodes, grassy carbon electrode was also used for the electrolysis. After 1 hour electrolysis of NaCl solution at pH 14, no absorbance peak was observed at 292 nm and OCl - was not detected. On the other hand, after 1 hour electrolysis of NaCl solution at pH 11, OCl - was detected within all the potential range. Also, after the electrolysis of the solution at pH 9, OCl - was detected. These results showed that NaCl solutions at lower pH were beneficial to produce OCl - . Fig.1 shows the OCl - production and faradaic efficiency for each electrolysis potential at pH11. As the applied potential was increased, the OCl - production increased accordingly. The faradaic efficiency also increased with the potential reaching around 70% with the electrolysis at 6.0 V for 1 hour. Reasonably, the remaining 30% of the current is used in the competing reaction, the oxygen evolution reaction. In line with this hypothesis, at pH 14 only oxygen evolution reaction occurred without OCl - production, because water oxidation is favored at high pH. Though OCl - production occurred with the glassy carbon electrodes, the faradaic efficiency was lower than that with BDD electrodes. When the applied potential was the same 3.0 V, the faradaic efficiency with BDD was higher than that with GC (BDD:28.9%, GC:18.9%), though OCl - production was similar (BDD: 130&#956;mol cm -2 , GC: 134&#956;mol cm -2 ). The surface condition of GC changed from smooth to rough, while BDD showed negligible modifications. Therefore, BDD electrode is better for OCl - production in selectivity and stability than glassy carbon electrode. Figure 1</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Biomass Upgrading of 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural to 2,5-Furandicarboxylic Acid Under Mild Alkaline Media</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02563755mtgabs</link>
      <description>Eunchong Lee, Yun Jeong Hwang, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-02(56)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405640392

                Biomass holds promise as a substitute for carbon sources derived from fossil fuels, which are known for their production of CO 2 emissions and contribution to microplastic pollution. 2,5-Furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) from biomass-derived 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) has emerged as a green plastic because it is a monomer of poly(ethylene furoate), poised as a viable alternative to poly(ethylene terephthalate) due to its robust mechanical properties and environmentally sustainable production. An electrochemical oxidation reaction of HMF to FDCA (HMFOR) has been studied actively due to the high performance and cost-effectiveness of transition metal catalysts. Furthermore, it demonstrates a lower overpotential for water splitting by substituting the anodic reaction from oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to HMFOR with value-added FDCA production than oxygen. The majority of HMFOR research has been carried out in highly alkaline media (1 M KOH) because the OH - serves as a reactant and accelerates the HMFOR. Nevertheless, this approach is not conducive to scaling up concentrated HMFOR processes due to the risk of high OH - concentrations, which leads to the instability of HMF through polymerization into humin. Herein, we investigate the HMFOR under mild alkaline media, ensuring the preservation of HMF, facilitated by a Cu-Ni based catalyst. In contrast to the conditions at high pH, the oxidation of aldehyde groups was inhibited due to the lack of sufficient OH - , which hindered the OH - mediated formation of germinal diols. Through several in situ studies, we proposed that Cu induces the adsorption of OH - and HMF, promoting the geminal diol formation, and Ni acts as the most active site of HMFOR. This research would be expected to provide strategies for achieving highly efficient HMFOR while maintaining the stability of HMF via suppression of the OH - mediated humin polymerization.</description>

                Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in ambient electrolyzers consumes a significant amount of energy and yields oxygen, an inherently low-value product. Therefore, it is imperative to choose anodic reactions that can make efficient use of the supplied energy to the electrolyzer when paired with a desired cathodic reaction such as CO 2 reduction into value-added commodities. Utilizing biomass oxidation offers a promising avenue to reduce the overall energy input by &gt;50% while producing high-value chemicals, and address the critical requirements for biomass conversion, a crucial 21st-century non-fossil carbon resource. In this work, we demonstrate the oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) as an alternative to OER. This reaction not only reduces the theoretical overall energy input into the electrolyzer but also generates FDCA, a significant building block for the sustainable polyester PEF, which has a global market size of more than 30 Mt/yr. We present an experimental and computational approach to understand HMF oxidation on Ni-based catalysts. Our experimental investigation involves evaluating the effect of microenvironment on thin-film (5nm) Ni-catalyst in a pH range of 11-13 to understand the intrinsic kinetics of HMF oxidation. In addition, we compare the reaction energetics of OER and the hydride transfer reaction of the HMF oxidation using density functional theory to understand the competing reaction pathways on the anode. Using the experimental data, we also develop a Multiphysics model to evaluate the electrode kinetics and species concentration distribution near the catalyst surface to understand the implications of mass transport limitations in this electrochemical system. This comprehensive analysis could potentially provide new guidelines to design more energy-efficient anodes for upgrading sustainable alcohols. This work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.</description>

                Abstract Inhibiting the deactivation of nickel&#8208;based catalysts caused by self&#8208;oxidation and competitive adsorption behavior is still a major challenge for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), especially under industrial&#8208;level current densities. In this study, a crystalline NiSe 2 /amorphous NiFe&#8208;LDH (NiSe 2 /NiFe&#8208;LDH) heterojunction catalyst is rationally constructed for selective electrocatalytic UOR. In situ Raman spectra and ex situ characterization results reveal that such a structure can tailor the self&#8208;oxidation of catalyst and impede the accumulation of NiOOH species during the UOR process. Density function theory simulations disclose that the self&#8208;driven charge transport from electron&#8208;deficient NiFe&#8208;LDH region to electron&#8208;rich NiSe 2 region would induce the formation of local electrophilic/nucleophilic region to adsorb the electron&#8208;donating &#8208;NH 2 and electron&#8208;withdrawing C = O groups, respectively. This optimizes the adsorption of urea molecules and hinders the overaccumulation of OH &#8722; ions on the surface of NiSe 2 /NiFe&#8208;LDH, which is beneficial for the priority occurrence of UOR over the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the realization of high UOR selectivity. Benefiting from the tailored surface self&#8208;oxidation and favorable urea adsorption, the NiSe 2 /NiFe&#8208;LDH could act as a high&#8208;selective UOR anode and achieve ultrahigh 800 mAcm &#8722;2 only at 1.447 V. Besides, UV&#8211;vis spectrophotometry also unveiled that the NiSe 2 /NiFe&#8208;LDH has the capability to electrochemically degrade urea, offering great promise for practical application potentials.</description>

                Advances in the theoretical understanding of electrochemical systems have, over the past decade, led to growing use of periodic Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies to treat a surprisingly large ensemble of electrocatalytic reactions, ranging from carbon dioxide electroreduction to oxygen evolution. Many such studies have employed simplified models of the electrochemical environment to determine reactivity trends across a broad space of catalytic materials, while other efforts have focused on developing detailed descriptions of electrochemical phenomena, such as the structure of electrochemical double layers, on model catalyst structures. An emerging challenge is to combine these approaches to ultimately enable theoretical design of electrocatalysts for reactions of significantly expanded chemical and materials complexity. In this talk, we begin by discussing how we develop and apply DFT-based methods to study the electrooxidation of ethanol and related oxygenated species on Pt surfaces. We show how explicit double layer models and ab initio molecular dynamics provide exciting insights beyond the traditional computational hydrogen electrode treatments, leading to improved descriptions of elementary reaction steps involving adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates and proton-coupled electron transfer processes. By combining the aggregate results with detailed microkinetic models and explicit descriptions of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions, we further demonstrate how these effects can influence both the predicted overpotentials and the selectivities to acetic acid, acetaldehyde, and carbon dioxide. We conclude with some perspectives on how these insights may be used to enhance the search for improved oxygenate electrooxidation catalysts.</description>

                Understanding how electrocatalysts evolve during operation is critical to optimizing their performance. The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) exposes electrocatalytic materials to harsh conditions that lead to significant transformations. A discovery that revolutionized OER catalysis was the dramatic improvement in activity due to the intentional, or incidental, in situ incorporation of Fe into Ni and Co oxyhydroxides. This finding raised questions about the true active phase in OER catalysts. While Fe incorporation is now widely acknowledged, there is still significant room for improvement in comprehending the in situ incorporation of trace metals and its effects on the electrochemical and structural properties of transition metal oxyhydroxides. We report a comprehensive investigation of in situ metal incorporation on nickel oxyhydroxide OER electrocatalysts encompassing four multivalent cations: Fe, Co, Mn, and Cu. We found that adding trace amounts of these to alkaline electrolytes alters the electrocatalytic and energy storage properties of NiO x H y films. As opposed to the well-known increase in OER activity induced by Fe incorporation ( Figure 1a ), in situ incorporation of trace Co and Mn increases the redox capacitance ( Figure 1b ), while Cu incorporation does not proceed. Depth profiling measurements reveal that metal incorporation is confined to the film's surface ( Figure 1c-d ), resulting in an interstratified structure that partially retains the more active, disordered phase. We describe four factors determining the occurrence of in situ metal incorporation, underscoring its nature as a cation exchange reaction. Finally, Fe and Co cation exchange processes are manipulated by shifting the solubility equilibrium and through ion complexation. By providing a better understanding of in situ metal incorporation processes, our results underscore its potential as a strategy for manipulating the surface chemical composition.

                The development of bifunctional electrocatalysts using renewable electricity for sustainable green energy industrial production is a potential method. As a result, numerous standard methodologies investigate developing electrocatalysts that naturally alter the electronic structure and minimize kinetic barriers. This study developed a promising method for engineering interfacial heterostructure nanoframes (Co2P/FeP-FeP4, hereafter denoted as CFP-8) deposited on nickel foam using hydrothermal and low-temperature phosphorization techniques. However, the improved CFP-8 electrocatalyst was exposed to abundant active sites and nanocrystals that remained intact. Importantly, P incorporation plays a crucial role in creating a P vacancy defect, which contributes to the thermodynamic favoring of the electrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and intrinsically enhances the hydrogen adsorption-free energy in hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs), due to the interconnected arrangement of CFP-8 nanoframes via the synergistic and strain-induced effect. Therefore, enclosed CFP-8 nanoframes demonstrate good performance and display low overpotential with high current densities (HER, &#951;10 = 97 mV, &#951;20 = 131 mV, &#951;50 = 186 mV; OER, &#951;10 = 230 mV, &#951;20 = 247 mV, &#951;50 = 280 mV) with a minimal Tafel value of &#951;10 = 111 mV/dec and &#951;10 = 74 mV/dec for HER and OER under alkaline medium, superior to benchmark electrocatalysts. Also, CFP-8 demonstrated remarkable stability over 50 h, utilizing chronoamperometry (CA) and chronopotentiometry (CP). In addition, an integrated electrolyzer using CFP-8/NF electrodes (polymeric binder-free electrodes) delivered a cell voltage of 1.65 V with a current density of 20 mA cm&#8211;2 with accelerated kinetics and improved stability, outperforming Pt/C (cathode)||RuO2 (anode) for overall water splitting reactions (OWSRs). The coexistence of Co, Fe, and P elements may accelerate electron and mass movement, improving the high current density electrocatalytic performance. This method paves the way for further research into low-cost transition metal-based phosphides for bifunctional energy applications.</description>

                The development of highly active and durable electrode for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential for efficient hydrogen production by polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Ir oxide is currently used as OER catalysts, while their extreme scarcity and high cost hinder the widespread adoption of PEMWE. Recently, Ru oxide has attracted attention as a non-iridium OER catalyst with high electronic conductivity. However, since its electrochemical stability under acidic environment is quite low compared to Ir oxide, significant stability improvement is needed for practical applications of Ru-oxide catalysts. In this talk, I will present our recent work on surface and interface control to improve the performance of Ru oxide using single crystal thin film electrodes prepared by arc-plasma deposition. First, I will introduce the beneficial role of Ti doping on RuO 2 ( hkl ) surfaces ( hkl = 110, 001, 100). The OER activity, stability, and corrosion resistance were enhanced by a small amount of Ti doping on all the hkl surfaces. Second, the importance of structural control of noble metal oxide catalyst/transition metal oxide support interface will be discussed. The SnO 2 interlayer effectively improved not only the electronic resistance, but also the structural stability at the catalyst/support interface [1]. These studies demonstrate that metal oxide thin film model electrodes are powerful platforms to elucidate the role of surface and interfacial structure on the water electrolysis electrodes. This study was partly supported by JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number 21H01661, 22K19078 and Toyota Mobility Foundation Hydrogen Initiative. [1] N. Todoroki, R. Kudo, K. Hayashi, M. Yokoi, N. Naraki and T.

      <title>(Invited) Electrochemical Stripping for Ammonia Recovery: Mechanisms and Impacts of Chlorine Evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02493502mtgabs</link>
      <description>Jinxing Ma, Jiazhou He, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-02(49)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405641289

                Electrochemical stripping is an attractive alternative to converting NH 4 + to NH 3(g) via the OH &#8722; produced by the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode. However, conventional electrochemical systems suffer from relatively low ammonia recovery (&lt;80%) and need of external acid solution to absorb ammonia. To address the limitations, this work has developed a novel stacked system that uses anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to in&#8722;situ produce acid and achieve chemical free ammonia recovery. To solve the issue of ammonia escape caused by constant current charging in conventional electrochemical systems, pulsed electric field (PEF) has been applied to regulate side reactions and interfacial mass transfer, weakening the sweeping effect of hydrogen gas produced by the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction on ammonia gas. With an ammonia removal rate of 35.1 g&#8722;N m &#8722;2 h &#8722;1 and an electrical energy consumption of 28.9 kWh kg&#8722;N &#8722;1 , our chemical&#8722;free system in PEF mode has achieved significantly higher ammonia recovery (&gt;90%) from high-strength streams. With regard to a high concentration of chloride, high potentials during electrolysis may lead to the generation of strong active chlorine. The non&#8722;specific oxidation of ammonia by active chlorine results in lower ammonia recovery. This study therefore combined in&#8722;situ Raman spectroscopy to explore the effects of chloride ion concentration and pH on ammonia speciation and recovery. Under strong acidic conditions, active chlorine mainly escaped in the form of Cl 2(g) , thus having a negligible effect on ammonia recovery. The proposed system maintained good stability after 390 h continuous operation. While the effect of active chlorine on ammonia oxidation was negligible, the reaction of chlorine with dissolved organic matter (DOM) can form more toxic by-products. This work further realized the effective control of by-products through the integration with activated carbon adsorption process. Overall, the total cost to recover 1 kg of NH 3 &#8211;N using the electrochemical system from real waste stream is $15.9, which includes $11.1 for capital expenses (CapEx) and $4.8 for operating expenses (OpEx). This highlights the great potential for realizing high ammonia recovery in practical applications, and provides insights to innovations in treatment and resource recovery.</description>

      <title>Utilization of Waste Melamine Formaldehyde Resin As an Enhancer in g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; Photocatalyst and Photoelectrochemical Applications</title>

                Melamine Formaldehyde resin (MF), one of the thermoset plastic frequently used for cook wares, adhesive, insulator and coatings because of its thermostability, mechanical strength, electronic insulation and ease of manufacture. However, because of above properties of MF resin, it is hard to recycle after used, which causes serious environmental contamination. To overcome this drawback of after-used MF resin, we introduce a method on utilizing after-used MF resin for an enhancer of g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst, inspired by pristine methodologies to synthesize g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst. The pristine g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst is synthesized by heat polymerization of urea, dicyandiamide(DCDA) and melamine and it utilize widely as a photocatalytst because it has a suitable band gap for visible light absorption, high chemical stability, and high thermal stability. However, high electron-hole recombination rate of g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst regarded as the reason decreases photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst. Therefore, in this study, after-used MF resin as an enhancer during g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst syntehsis process, to improve photocatalytic activity of g-C 3 N 4 . The pure g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst was synthesized by heat polyemrization of urea and MF resin added g-C 3 N 4 photocatalyst (MR X, X is the amount of added MF resin) was synthesized by adding certain amount of MF resin during g-C 3 N 4 synthesis process. Comparing photocatalytic activity between pure g-C 3 N 4 and MR photocatalyst was carried out by Methyl Orange (MO) degradation under 1 sun illumination. Finally, pure g-C 3 N 4 and MR photocatalyst was fabricated as an photoelectrode and their oxygen evolution reaction(OER) activity was analyzed by electrochemical analysis techniques.</description>

                Research on CO 2 conversion into valuable materials has attracted much attention, aiming to realize carbon neutrality and carbon-negative emission technology. It has been reported that the unique physicochemical properties of high-temperature molten salt, such as high conductivity and wide electrochemical window, make it possible to obtain solid carbon directly from CO 2 and metal carbides. In this study, we focused on the electrochemical formation of CaC 2 from CO 2 in high-temperature chloride melt. CaC 2 is the raw material for acetylene, the starting material for various chemical products. This study demonstrated the selective formation of CaC 2 from CO 2 by an electrochemical process in NaCl-KCl-CaCl 2 -CaO melt at 823 K to produce C 2 H 2 with high current efficiency. When the inert material for oxygen evolution in the high-temperature melts was used as the anode, the formation of acetylene and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water can be realized as the total reaction. 2CO 2 + H 2 O &#8594; C 2 H 2 + 5/2O 2 On the metal cathode, the CaC 2 was formed through two reactions: the carbon electrodeposition from CO 2 -derived CO 3 2&#8722; (Step 1) and the electrochemical reduction of Ca(II) ion on the carbon (Step 2). These two reactions could be controlled by conducting potentiostatic electrolysis under CO 2 and Ar atmospheres, resulting in acetylene synthesis with a maximum current efficiency of 92%. The electrolysis on carbon electrodes revealed that the higher the crystallinity of carbon, the more selectively CaC 2 was formed. The CaC 2 formation was induced by the reduction of Ca(II) ions on the basal plane of the graphite layer rather than the edge plane. The unique interfacial phenomenon between high-temperature melt and a carbon electrode surface will contribute to realizing a highly efficient CO 2 conversion process to acetylene. It was found that the electrochemical formation of CaC 2 tends to proceed at the basal plane of the graphite layer. This reaction mechanism is entirely different from the interlayer reactions that tend to occur in LIBs and is unique to this electrolytic system at the carbon/molten salt interface. The obtained data will provide a highly efficient process for CO 2 resource conversion and physicochemical insights into new carbon surface reactions.</description>

      <title>Predicted Current Density Response Versus Applied Potential for Five Crystallographic IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Facets: Comparison with Thin Film Experiment</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02614095mtgabs</link>
      <description>Soonho Kwon, Kelsey A. Stoerzinger, Reshma R. Rao, Liang Qiao, William A. Goddard, Yang Shao&#8208;Horn, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-02(61)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405639586

                Iridium oxide (IrO 2 ) stands out as the most effective catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a pivotal component of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers. Despite its exceptional catalytic prowess, the kinetics of this reaction still impose limitations on the efficient production of green H 2 , thereby inflating costs and impeding broader commercialization. The catalytic activity of IrO 2 for OER is influenced by its local chemical and atomic environment, wherein distinct crystallographic facets with unique atomic arrangements can induce significant variations even with the same bulk composition. In this study, we examine the OER performance across five distinct rutile IrO 2 facets. Through DFT calculations, we predict cyclic voltammetry (under the water oxidation potential) and compare directly to the results to experiments conducted on IrO 2 thin films for validation. Unlike pure metallic systems characterized by degenerate active sites resulting in broad single redox peaks, or homogeneous systems where redox reactions occur at metallic centers, active sites on metal oxide surfaces exhibit localization yet remain interconnected via various types of oxygen bonds. This unique attribute introduces additional considerations that must be included to interpret redox behavior, because interactions between adjacent intermediates alter their identities differently for different applied potentials. We find that multiple redox features can overlap while a single type of redox couple can be associated with multiple redox features. To elucidate the OER activity under operational conditions (&gt; 1.23 V RHE ), we conducted grand canonical calculations to explicitly capture the dependence of reactions on the applied potential, with particular emphasis on non-electrochemical steps such as O-O coupling. Through the construction of various possible OER pathways and amalgamating their energy landscapes into a unified microkinetic scheme under steady-state assumptions, we successfully replicate the experimental OER current density for each of the five facets. Our analysis unveils mechanistic disparities between nucleophilic attack and direct oxo coupling across facets, predicting rates as a function of applied potential and identifying the rate-limiting steps. Our approach provides a thorough comprehension of the OER mechanism at the atomic level, offering valuable insights into the structural characteristics that enhance or inhibit the OER activity of IrO 2 . We expect these insights to have implications for understanding the structural effects on other heterogeneous catalysts which should aid the development of more efficient electrocatalysts.</description>

                Water (H 2 O) electrolysis represents a sustainable approach to produce green hydrogen (H 2 ); however, the high energy cost (2H 2 O &#8594; 4H 2 + O 2 , &#8710;H&#176; = 286 kJ/mol H 2 , E&#176; = &#8722;1.23 V) associated with water electrolysis and electricity cost (&gt;$50/MWh) results in a minimum H 2 selling price &#8776;$4/kg H 2 . Therefore, we need to find an alternative process to generate H 2 to meet the current U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Energy Earthshots of $1/kg H 2 in one decade. Seawater represents an earth abundant natural H 2 O source for H 2 generation in island and coastal communities. However, there are several technical challenges hindering its widespread implementation such as the corrosive nature of seawater and the production of poisonous chlorine gas (Cl 2 ) via the chlorine evolution reaction (CER: 4Cl - &#8594; Cl 2 + 4e - , E&#176; = 1.36 V vs. RHE). The CER competes against the oxygen evolution reaction (OER: 2H 2 O &#8594; 4H + + 4e - + O 2 , E&#176; = 1.23 V vs. RHE), thus inhibiting the production of e - and H + needed for the H 2 production via the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER: 4H + + 4e - &#8594; 2H 2 , E&#176; = 0.0 V vs RHE). Instead, we propose to use the full electrocatalytic oxidation (FECO) of naturally-occurring and artificially-made organic molecules to generate H 2 (e.g., CH 3 COOH + 2H 2 O &#8594; 2CO 2 + 8e - + 8H + , E&#176; = &#8722;0.02 V vs RHE) which occurs at &gt;1 V lower potential than CER and OER. As opposed to traditional H 2 O electrolysis that requires clean water streams, the proposed electrolysis technology can use readily available H 2 O streams containing organic molecules (e.g., municipal wastewater) combined with seawater to generate H 2 while removing the undesirable organic contaminants. In this work, we compare the performance of heterogeneous electrocatalysts for the FECO of organic molecules present in wastewater in a model seawater electrolyte (0.1&#8722;0.6 M NaCl) at room temperature. PECO electrocatalysts were developed and tested using real wastewaters derived from several sources including the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of food waste. We synthesized the PECO electrocatalysts using both platinum-group metals (PGM) as well as base-group metals (BGM) and tested them as a function of half-cell potential. Our results show that both PGM- and BGM-based bimetallics improve the activity and stability compared to the baseline RuO 2 -based catalysts. Figure 1</description>

                Solar-driven seawater splitting is a promising approach for sustainable green hydrogen generation. Chlorine evolution reaction (ClER) can provide much faster kinetics than oxygen evolution reaction (OER), due to lower number of electrons involved in the interfacial charge transfer. Designing stable and efficient photoelectrodes for a photoelectrochemical (PEC) seawater splitting presents challenges due to the corrosive nature of seawater. BiVO 4 has been a promising photoanode for solar energy conversion to molecular hydrogen (H 2 ), due to desirable bandgap (2.4 eV), favorable band position and chemical stability. Nevertheless, BiVO 4 has been mostly employed for OER, and shows limitation of poor charge transport and insufficient active sites for interfacial charge transfer. This study proposed a composite photoanode comprising MoO x hole transfer layer and iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) electrocatalysts on BiVO 4 , to enhance photocurrent and stability in the PEC seawater splitting. The MoO x layer, containing Mo 6+ as electron donors, was deposited on BiVO 4 using a simple drop-casting method. A simple reductive electrodeposition introduced the FeOOH electrocatalysts, while simultaneously forming MoO x with surface defect states (FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 ) to facilitate the facilitating hole transfer through the segregated MoO x layer. The surface structure of FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 photoanode was investigated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed successful synthesis of MoO x and FeOOH layers on BiVO 4 . The charge separation efficiency was four times higher on the FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 photoanode (78%) compared to the intact BiVO 4 photoanode (18%). Additionally, the FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 photoanode exhibited improved photocurrent density for OER and ClER under simulated AM 1.5 G sunlight, reaching 3.3 mA cm -2 at 1.23 V RHE in circum-neutral pH, which is approximately three times higher than that of the intact BiVO 4 . The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of the FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 photoanode reached 0.9% at 1.23 V RHE , five times higher than that of intact BiVO 4 . Such excellent PEC activity can be ascribed to introduced surface defects (such as oxygen vacancy) on MoO x /BiVO 4 and alleviated kinetic barrier by FeOOH. Moreover, the photocurrent density of the FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 photoanode in a 0.5 M NaCl electrolyte (for ClER) was 0.5 mA cm -2 higher than that in 0.5 M Na 2 SO 4 electrolyte (for OER). Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) confirmed the improved charge transport behavior of the modified BiVO 4 for OER or ClER. The generation of reactive chlorine species could compromise the stability of FeOOH, which could be mitigated by an added aqueous pollutants. For instance, in the PEC chlorine evolution reaction system, ammonia or 4-chlorophenol as model pollutant enhanced the stability. Notably, the FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 exhibited a 10-fold higher rate for ammonia oxidation compared to the intact BiVO 4 . A moderated concentration of bromide ion could further elevate the photocurrent density. The increased photocurrent activity of the modified FeOOH/MoO x /BiVO 4 photoanode in PEC splitting of blended seawater and wastewater can serve multifaceted purposes, enhancing the efficiency of pollutants degradation (or chemical upgrading) and H 2 evolution.</description>

                Although the use of fossil fuels is gradually decreasing every year, it still accounts for more than 80% of global energy consumption, and discriminatory use is causing a significant increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentration and global warming. In order to control the indiscriminate use of fossil fuels that cause environmental problems, establishing an eco-friendly energy conversion system is essential. The water electrolysis using surplus power generated from renewable energy is recognized as a representative system that can produce high-purity hydrogen from water. On the other hand, CO 2 electrolysis is also a promising energy conversion technology that can reduce atmospheric CO 2 centration because it electrochemically converts CO 2 into valuable carbon products. Both of the above systems are based on electrochemical reactions, which means they can operate under moderate conditions with zero pollutant emissions. In general, the composition of conventional energy conversion system includes an electrolyte layer, which has a large ohmic resistance and limitation of CO 2 solubility, which reduces energy efficiency. To address the disadvantage of the conventional system, membrane electrode assembly (MEA)-based electrolyzer are receiving attention. The MEA consists of an electrode and a membrane with a polymer membrane capable of ion exchange between the anode and the cathode. These MEA-based electrolyzer has a zero-gap configuration, providing minimized ohmic resistance and improved energy efficiency. Among them, various studies are being actively conducted on applying an anion exchange membrane (AEM) to MEA-based electrolyzers. When using AEM, water electrolysis has the advantage of being able to use a non-noble metal catalyst, which can reduce costs, and CO 2 electrolysis has the advantage of reducing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which is a competing reaction. Herein, the electrode with a structure in which electrocatalyst is loaded on a porous transport layer (PTL) is fabricated by the facile electrodeposition method. The electrodeposition is possible to fabricate self-supported electrodes by modulating catalytic properties such as morphology, composition, and crystallinity by controlling various parameters. Additionally, ionomer and binder-free electrode structure prepared through electrodeposition contributes to improving catalytic performance by promoting electron transfer to the active site. Moreover, the as-prepared porous transfer electrodes (PTE) are used as cathode and anode in anion exchange MEA-based electrolyzer and exhibit reasonable single-cell performance, suggesting that PTEs prepared via electrodeposition are suitable for energy conversion systems such as water electrolysis and CO 2 electrolysis. In the MEA configuration, three cathodes, anodes, and AEM were optimized. In the cathode part, the HER was optimized using catalysts such as NiMo, Pt, and PtRu, and the CO 2 electrolysis was optimized using Au, Ag, Cu, and Pd. In the anode part, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) was optimized using catalysts such as NiFe, IrO 2 . In the membrane part, optimization was performed by comparing the commercial membrane and the fabricated fluorine-containing poly(fluorene)-based AEM.</description>

                Solutions for effective energy conversion and storage are needed for the shift from fossil fuel-based, CO 2 -intensive energy production to a future sustainable energy-based economy. This way green energy from renewable sources, such as solar or wind power, may later be re-electrified. One option is to use water electrolysis to transform energy from renewable sources into chemical energy in the form of hydrogen. Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis is a potent, cutting-edge technique that leverages rare iridium-based catalysts to boost the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) to solve this issue. Reducing the total density of iridium-based catalysts for the OER requires minimizing the usage of rare and valuable iridium, which will enhance the PEM process's sustainability and economics. Here we present an investigation aimed to further reduce the iridium usage for proton-exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis. First, SnO 2 nanofibers are produced utilizing a water-free alkoxide route. A wet-chemical method is then used to deposit nanoparticulate IrO(OH) x on the filaments. After subsequent oxidation at various temperatures, the final OER active catalyst is obtained. With the emphasis on reaching high activity, stability, and conductivity at the laboratory level, ultra-small interconnected IrO x /IrO 2 nanoparticles anchored to electrospun SnO 2 nanofibers (IrO x /IrO 2 @SnO 2 ) and associated percolation pathways are investigated. The utilization of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in scanning mode (STEM) before and after electrocatalytic reactions provides insights into the oxidation and crystallization state of iridium oxide nanoparticles dependent on temperature and upon catalytic use. This enables an understanding of further possible reduction of iridium content by optimizing synthesis parameters. The data indicate that the optimal iridium utilization is achieved at 375&#176;C oxidation temperature, with the highest resulting conductivity and electrochemical activity. Furthermore, TEM data reveal initiation of crystallization of IrO 2 in the temperature window between 365 and 375&#176;C. The pivotal role of conductivity in electron transport to active sites is underscored by cyclic voltammetry (CVA) measurements, which provide further insight regarding performance and stability with a view on future PEM electrolysis applications. These findings not only enhance our fundamental understanding but also offer practical strategies for advancing cost-effective and efficient electrolysis technologies.</description>

                The electrification of the petrochemical industry will greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the manufacturing of commodity chemicals; however, electrification on a global scale is only achievable using earth-abundant materials for electrocatalysis in place of state-of-the-art catalysts made from precious metals. A promising catalyst that has been used for industrial hydrodesulfurization and electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution, nitrate reduction, carbon dioxide reduction, and oxygen evolution is Ni 2 P. Ni 2 P and other transition metal phosphides benefit from active site ensembles that moderate the binding of reaction intermediates, making them promising electrocatalysts for reactions beyond the ones listed, especially other hydrogenation reactions. However, Ni 2 P and other TMPs are susceptible to oxidation, which can lead to catalyst degradation and loss in certain conditions. Stability is an important part of catalysis; therefore, it is important to understand the degradation mechanism of Ni 2 P in order to mitigate corrosion, accurately predict surface reactivity, and prepare Ni 2 P for industrial electrocatalysis. Previous reports on Ni-P alloys found passivation regimes through anodic polarization but others saw complete dissolution at more oxidizing potentials. Bulk nickel phosphides have been shown to have a passivated surface, and characterization, often limited to ex-situ spectroscopy after the fact, has shown that the surface is composed of nickel hydroxides, phosphates, and oxyhydroxides. In the present work, operando Ni K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy and polarization are combined to understand the electrochemical degradation of Ni 2 P nanoparticles. Ni 2 P nanoparticles were synthesized by heating NiCl 2 and tris(diethylamino)phosphine in oleylamine and thermally annealed at 450 &#176;C under 5% H 2 /95% N 2 . Transmission-mode Ni K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy was conducted on benchtop spectrometers (easyXAFS) using a 3D-printed electrochemical cell designed for operando spectroscopy. Nanoparticles maximize surface to bulk atom ratio, which is beneficial both for electrocatalysis, less atoms are necessary to have the same number of active sites, and for X-ray absorption, spectra are more surface sensitive. The use of a benchtop spectrometer offers the flexibility to iterate on experiments on the fly and the power to acquire synchrotron quality data on a routine basis. Preliminary results in neutral phosphate buffered electrolyte indicate that Ni 2 P significantly oxidizes and dissolves at and beyond 0.8 V vs RHE which agrees with anodic polarization corrosion experiments. Ongoing work extends anodic polarization experiments to acidic and basic pH and probes the potentials at which oxidation is no longer reversible. We hypothesize that dissolution will be less severe with increased pH and reduction of oxidized species to Ni 2 P will no longer be possible after the onset of Ni dissolution.</description>

                The transition from fossil fuel-based and CO 2 -intensive energy production to a future sustainable energy-based economy requires solutions for efficient energy conversion and storage for later re-electrification of green energy from a renewable source such as solar or wind power. One possibility is to convert energy from sustainable sources into chemical energy in the form of hydrogen by electrolysis of water. To meet this challenge, Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysis is a powerful, state-of-the-art technology that uses scarce iridium-based catalysts to promote the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). To improve the sustainability and economics of the PEM process, it is necessary to minimize the use of rare and precious iridium to reduce the overall density of iridium-based catalysts for the OER. Here, we present different strategies for the synthesis of low-total iridium OER catalysts. In addition to the choice of support material and support morphology, we also consider the coating strategy to produce highly active and durable catalysts. The coating of corrosion-resistant high surface area metal oxide supports of various morphologies with an ultrathin layer of amorphous iridium hydroxide by a simple wet chemical synthesis at low temperature and ambient pressure or by a hydrothermal approach leads to the formation of interconnected amorphous hydrous iridium oxide particles. In a subsequent step, the amorphous phase is oxidized at elevated temperatures using an Adams fusion salt melt. This process allows a controllable phase transformation and crystallization to form a layer of interconnected partially crystalline IrOx nanoparticles of &#8776;1.5-2 nm domain size on the surface of the supporting metal oxides, thus providing an electrical percolation path in the catalyst layer. The appropriate choice of support material in terms of crystal lattice parameters can moderate the crystal growth of the iridium oxide in terms of epitaxy and significantly increase the stability due to tight anchoring to the support. The final core-shell nanostructures comprise highly active iridium oxide with total Ir weight fractions as low as 7at% on SnO 2 nanoparticles, compared to a state-of-the-art benchmark catalyst with 56at% Ir supported on TiO 2 nanoparticles. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging was used to elucidate the effect of different core-shell designs, particularly on iridium coating and crystallinity. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) measurements were performed to evaluate the electrochemical properties and assess the activity of respective catalyst as well as the cycling stability. Further, membrane electrode (MEA) polarization curves suggest enhanced stability of epitaxial catalyst layers.</description>

                To anticipate high performance in the electrocatalytic reactions, a comprehensive understanding of the electric double layer (EDL) is essential. Experimental, spectroscopic, and computational studies of the EDL have been reported for understanding the performance in electrocatalytic reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR). Notably, in the CO 2 RR, previous studies have revealed the accumulation of cations near the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP) significantly has an impact on the reaction performance, product selectivity, and partial current density. The presence of these cations induces various effects, such as creating a strong electric field, altering local pH levels, stabilizing the intermediates, and specific adsorption. However, unraveling the sole cation effect remains challenging due to the system's complexity and hierarchical characteristics. Moreover, experiments predominantly conducted under favorable conditions for understanding the electric field and stabilization effects have left the specific adsorption effect relatively unexplored. Specific adsorption involves direct coordination with the electrode at the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), with the degree determined by catalyst type and electrolyte conditions. Previous studies have highlighted the significant impact of specific adsorption on current density and intermediate stabilization, with potassium (K + ) and cesium (Cs + ) cation exhibiting the most pronounced effect owing to their minimal hydration degree compared to the lithium (Li + ) and sodium (Na + ). Acidic CO 2 RR has recently garnered attention for its high carbon efficiency (CE) and energy efficiency (EE). However, the abundance of hydronium ions can lead to a favorable occurrence of HER over CO 2 RR due to its facile protonation. To mitigate this challenge, excess cations have been employed to suppress the hydronium ion migration and enhance the performance of the CO 2 RR, which means accumulated cation layer at the OHP can suppress the HER and stabilize the intermediates of the CO 2 RR simultaneously. Meanwhile, in the excess cation condition, adsorbed cations can be dominant on the electrode originated from the excess cations, which is not investigated intensively. For the better performance of the electrocatalytic reactions in the acidic condition, we need to elucidate the EDL formed in the presence of the excess cations. In here, we investigated the electrode-electrolyte interface in the different cation species during the acidic CO 2 RR through the attenuated total reflection-surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS), which can give the local information such as the adsorbed species on the metal and free species near the electrode. We confirmed the different product distribution and interface depending on the cation species, especially in the excess cations (1 M M + , M = Li, K, Cs). Specific adsorption in the presence of the excess cations can alter the product distribution, and it differs from the low cation concentration (0.1 M M + , M = Li, K, Cs). In final, to clarify the effect originated from the excess cations, we confirmed the interface on the copper and silver, which major products are C 2+ and C 1 , respectively.</description>

                Hydrogen is an attractive energy carrier with high energy density and without harmless burning products, leading to magnificent efforts to build the hydrogen production system. Accordingly, water electrolysis is one of the promising strategies to generate hydrogen without carbon emission, requiring highly active catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its sluggish reaction kinetics than hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). To reduce overpotential and increase economic feasibility, Ni and Fe based catalysts have extensively studied due to their high OER activity as well as excellent stability in alkaline media. Many studies have controlled the morphological characteristics and electronic structures of Ni-Fe based OER catalysts to enhancing electrocatalytic performances. Particularly, interface formation is considered as one of the most significant aspects to design and obtain the desirable anode material. In this study, we synthesized colloidal Ni-Fe intermediate nanoparticles (NFI NPs) with various molar ratios between Ni and Fe. Unique physical mixture phase of NFI NPs was identified by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy (TEM EDS), displaying that their morphological characteristics as well as crystalline phases depending on the composition of Ni and Fe. Through washing processes, the Fe 2 O 3 NPs were mainly aggregated around the metallic Ni NPs, meaning a formation of multiple contacts between Ni metal and Fe 2 O 3 NPs. Subsequent annealing step turned the simple contacts to Ni-Fe 2 O 3 heterointerfaces. Electrochemical performances were examined, revealing significantly lower OER overpotential (199 mV) at 10 mA cm -2 (75:25 sample) than that of the previous Ni-Fe catalysts. Among the products of various Ni and Fe ratio (from 100:0 to 0:100, molar ratio of metal precursors), the 75:25 sample presented the highest OER activity than the other samples. In addition, the 75:25 sample exhibited long-term durability under alkaline OER operation for 5 days, confirmed through chronopotentiometry analysis at 10 mA cm -2 . We speculated that this outstanding OER performance of 75:25 sample was due to the electronic structure modulation through Ni-Fe 2 O 3 heterointerfaces. The sample was further investigated through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to confirm the chemical states of catalyst surface. XPS results confirmed that oxyhydroxides were well formed on the metallic Ni sites than NiO, meaning that the Ni-Fe 2 O 3 was more efficient catalyst than the NiO-Fe 2 O 3 . This work revealed that colloidally synthesized 75:25 sample having Ni-Fe 2 O 3 heterointerfaces showed the highest OER performance among the samples we prepared. Furthermore, these results provide the insights to design the OER catalyst possessing heterointerfaces without precious metals.</description>

                Electrochemical ammonia oxidation reaction (AOR) offers a sustainable approach for waste ammonia remediation, energy conversion, and valuable product production.[1] Despite the promise of transition metal oxides as effective catalysts, the AOR mechanism on their surface remains elusive, along with factors leading to deactivation, which often involve surface poisoning species formation and site corrosion. Moreover, the AOR potential overlaps with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), leading to the formation of O 2 as a byproduct and an overall decline in energy efficiency. Therefore, it is critical to understand the molecular behavior of ammonia and other species on the oxide surface under reaction conditions. In this work, we systematically investigate the AOR mechanism on NiOOH and CuOOH, emphasizing the influence of OER and dissolved O 2 , which has been previously largely overlooked. Utilizing three in situ techniques: differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) for detecting gaseous intermediates and products, Raman spectroelectrochemistry for monitoring surface transformations, and UV-vis spectroelectrochemistry for observing species within the electrical double layer, we reveal that the formation of NiOOH/CuOOH, the AOR catalytic activity and selectivity, and the deactivation pathway are all significantly modulated by OER and the presence of O 2 . It is established that AOR on NiOOH is potential-dependent, with N 2 production being initiated at potentials coinciding with OER commencement and the generation of NO x species being favored at elevated potentials (Figure 1 left). Moreover, OER competes with the AOR to N 2 pathway but promotes the AOR to NO x (N 2 O, NO, and NO 2 ), which is further elucidated through the protective role of O 2 to remove *N poisoning species, mitigating surface deactivation and decreasing charge transfer resistance (Figure 1 right). On CuOOH, however, the O 2 can promote NO formation and Cu dissolution from the CuOOH layer, leading to complete deactivation at high potential. Our findings offer an in situ insight into the AOR mechanisms on metal oxides with co-existing OER and provide a critical direction for designing electrocatalysts for environmental applications, particularly for systems where long-term electrolysis is desired.

                Anion redox in layered Li-rich cathodes provides a high capacity but triggers a series of cascading issues. Current research predominantly focuses on how oxygen species participate in redox and how transition metals move, often ignoring the influence of magnetic frustration. This work systematically investigates the potential link between the evolution of magnetic frustration, structural evolution and oxygen redox in honeycomb Li2RuO3. Our findings indicate that the phase transition from C2/c to R3 exacerbates the magnetic frustration during Ru oxidation. Subsequently, during oxygen oxidation, the strong magnetic frustration drives the generation of (O2)n&#8722; and trapped O2, which serves to relieve and eventually eliminate the magnetic frustration. This (O2)n&#8722;/O2 formation mechanism, termed "magnetic-frustration-driven mechanism", provides a plausible explanation for the formation of trapped O2 in the systems with strong covalent TM&#8211;O bonds. Accordingly, we emphasize that improvement strategies should not only enhance the covalent TM&#8211;O bonds but also relieve strong magnetic frustration.</description>

      <title>(Invited) Neutral Seawater Splitting of Perovskite Oxynitrides Under Sunlight via Alternative Oxidation Reactions</title>

                Photo-electrochemical (PEC) seawater splitting using semiconductors is a promising means of directly producing hydrogen from seawater occupying approximately 97% of Earth&#8217;s water. The n-type perovskite oxynitride semiconductors with a general formula AB(O,N) 3 (A=Ca, Sr, Ba or La; B=Ti, Nb or Ta) are capable of absorbing intensive visible light up to 750 nm wavelength, thermodynamically leading to high solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 10% or above. 1 Also, their band positions straddle various oxidation and reduction potentials including the water redox potential to produce value-added energy resources such as H 2 , HCOOH, and NH 3 . 2 Based on the favorable optical properties, the water splitting activity using the oxynitrides has been significantly increased in strong alkaline electrolytes, although it is still low in neutral electrolytes. 2-3 Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is driven via four-electron oxidation. Its kinetics is commonly very sluggish in neutral aqueous solutions, which the significant overpotential is required to catalyze it. Thus, applying alternative oxidations to OER, such as chlorine evolution reaction (CER), may be a feasible approach to efficient hydrogen production in neutral seawater electrolytes. 4 In terms of thermodynamic potential, OER ( E 0 = 1.23 V NHE ) is more oxidative than CER ( E 0 = 1.36 V NHE ). However, CER driven via two-electron oxidation can be catalyzed faster than OER kinetically in neutral electrolytes. Herein we first present sunlight-driven seawater splitting activity of perovskite AB(O,N) 3 largely improved in neutral environments and also discuss CER activity depending on various pH values as an alternative oxidation to OER. Highly-crystalline, porous SrNbO 2 N particles grown on Nb substrate was prepared by bottom-up fabrication including oxidation of Nb substrate and flux-assisted nitridation. 5 The advanced fabrication caused less-defective oxynitride with a large surface area. The resulting SrNbO 2 N/Nb photoanode produced significant OER photocurrent in 0.2 M NaPi electrolyte at a neutral pH 6.4, and the photocurrent was three times increased by adding 0.5 M NaCl to catalyze CER simultaneously. Moreover, the onset potential for seawater splitting including CER was shifted to a lower potential by approximately 0.1 V RHE than that for water splitting leading to OER exclusively. These results clearly demonstrate that CER was preferentially catalyzed during neutral seawater splitting compared with competitive OER. It also implies that CER kinetics over the SrNbO 2 N was faster than OER kinetics despite its unfavorable thermodynamic potential. The BaTaO 2 N/Ta photoanode, more photoactive and stable than the Nb-based oxynitrides, was synthesized in the similar manner. The seawater splitting of the oxynitride at different pH values was further investigated, and the quantitative analysis of the resulting products, namely, H 2 , O 2 , and ClO &#8722; was also performed to determine the operating conditions suitable for efficient and stable seawater splitting. Moreover, different electro-catalysts to improve the selectivity to CER were evaluated in the artificial seawater. The enhanced seawater splitting activity and selectivity to CER of the AB(O,N) 3 in artificial seawater will be discussed in detail in a presentation. References J. Seo, H. Nishiyama, T. Yamada, K.

                As is well known, the global movement toward carbon neutrality became legally effective as an internationally applicable law on November 4, 2016. This encouraged countries worldwide to proactively invest in the development of environmentally friendly energy conversion and storage technologies. Among various renewable energy, hydrogen stands out as an abundant and eco-friendly energy source. Therefore, the development of water electrolyzers and fuel cells is crucial for producing and utilizing green hydrogen, a key to advancing the hydrogen economy. To improve and commercialize these two specific electrochemical applications, the development of efficient electrocatalytic materials is essential. Moreover, the rapid advancement in computer performance and software engineering since the introduction of Moore&#8217;s Law has enabled the development of effective materials by predicting catalytic activity and durability based on the unique electronic configurations of materials. It facilitates the design and validation of optimal catalysts and enables a faster and more accurate search for ideal catalytic materials. Especially, according to the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) project, it is asserted that combining computational and experimental approaches can effectively discover, manufacture, and deploy advanced materials twice as fast and at a fraction of the cost compared to traditional methods. In recent energy research fields, the development of new energy materials based on theoretical mechanism validation and materials screening through computational methods, such as DFT calculations and molecular dynamics, is essential, not optional. In this presentation, effective strategies for designing superior materials, developed through theory-guided experimental approaches, will be introduced with a focus on two specific electrochemical applications: the polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) and the alkaline electrolyte membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE). The detailed two topics of the presentation are as follows. As the first research topic, PEMFCs function by efficiently converting chemical energy into electrical energy through electrochemical reactions, producing clean byproducts such as water and heat. Their appeal lies in their high energy efficiency, environmentally friendly energy conversion, and low operating temperatures. However, the widespread adoption and commercialization of PEMFCs have been impeded by various issues related to scientific challenges, durability, and cost-effectiveness. For PEMFCs to achieve broad commercialization, enhancing the intrinsic activity and durability of electrocatalysts and catalyst layers (CLs) at high current densities is crucial. Therefore, two research strategies of nanostructure control and durable carbon materials for long-term PEMFC will be respectively introduced as follows: (1) The intrinsically superstable PtCo intermetallic nanostructure, validated by machine-learning-derived real-size simulations; and (2) The anti-carbon corrosive fluorine-doped graphene nanoribbon/carbon nanotube (F-GNR@CNT) composite as additives in the electrode. As the second research topic, AEMWE presents a promising solution by combining the advantageous features of both alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) such as using non-precious metals in alkaline media and producing high-quality hydrogen at high-pressure. Although significant attention has conventionally been focused on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to its complex multi-electron transfer process, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is critical to the overall efficiency and cost-effectiveness of water electrolysis systems. This is because HER kinetics in alkaline media are approximately two to three orders of magnitude slower than in acidic media due to the Volmer step. Therefore, two research strategies for developing precious and non-precious electrocatalysts will be respectively introduced as follows: (1) The design of atomically ordered PtNi nanostructures for application in practical AEMWE systems; and (2) The introduction of a synergistic interfacial effect between Ni metal and CeO&#8322;. In summary, we have successfully designed superior electrocatalysts and durable carbon materials for green energy applications (PEMFC, AEMWE) through the combined study of computational and experimental approaches. For long-term PEMFCs, the highly ordered PtCo intermetallic nanostructure demonstrated robust stability in acidic conditions during the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Furthermore, the addition of F-GNR@CNT to the Pt/C cathode improved durability by enhancing carbon corrosion resistance and optimizing water management. For high-performance AEMWE, intermetallic PtNi nanostructures were introduced to intrinsically enhance catalytic activity and durability. Additionally, Ni/CeO&#8322; electrocatalysts, benefiting from a synergistic interfacial effect, were integrated into an industrial-scale durable AEMWE system with an active surface area of 64 cm&#178;. Finally, we definitely believe that the synergy between computational validation and experimental skills can be highly effective and productive in the field of energy research.

      <title>Shape- and Size-Controlled Preparation of Columnar Layered Transition Metal Hydroxides Enriched with Edges</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02674651mtgabs</link>
      <description>Akira Watanabe, Keisuke Muramatsu, Wataru Sugimoto, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-02(67)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405639594

                Layered transition metal hydroxides have been extensively studied as electrocatalyst for alkaline water electrolysis. 1 The morphological features such as size, aspect ratio, and exposed surface is known to strongly affect the performance of electrocatalysts, and edges are known to particularly exthibit high activity for oxygen evolution reactions. 2 Thus, controlling the crystal growth direction of layered metal hydroxides to expose more edges may be an effective method to enhance the catalytic activity of metal hydroxides. In general, layered materials, including layered metal hydroxides, grow preferentially along the lateral directions to form plate-like crystals, which means that preparation of columnar crystals with an aspect ratio of the thickness to the lateral size higher than 1 is difficult. Recently, we found the formation of columnar layered metal hydroxides with an aspect ratio exceeding 1 by utilizing metal-diamine complexes as precursors. 3 Here, we aim to control the size and aspect ratio of columnar crystals. We focused on the stability of the complexes and evaluated the anisotropic growth behavior of &#946;-Co(OH) 2 . Columnar crystals of metal hydroxide are synthesized by mixing metal salt solution and diamine ligand solution at specific molar ratios, followed by heating under hydrothermal conditions. During hydrothermal treatment, metal ions, which can undergo condensation, are gradually released from metal-diamine complexes, leading to the formation of supersaturated solutions. When the degree of supersaturation is relatively high, anisotropic growth towards the stacking direction occurs. The stability of the complexes becomes a controlling factor for crystal shape. By using cobalt ions as the metal source and N,N' -dimethylethylenediamine ( NN' -dmeda) as the ligand, [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] ratio was varied from 3 to 30 and the morphological change of the products was evaluated. Scanning electron microscopy images show microscale hexagonal-prism shaped crystals with aspect ratios exceeding 1 at [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] ratios of 3, 5, 10, and 15. Powder X-ray diffraction and electron diffraction analysis indicate that all products were &#946;-Co(OH) 2 and the long-axis direction of the columnar crystals corresponded to the stacking direction. Thus, the outer surfaces of these columnar crystals were enriched with edges. In the range of [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] = 3&#8211;10, the overall crystal size increased both in the stacking and lateral direction according to the increase of [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] while maintaining an average aspect ratio of approximately 2. At [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] = 15, columnar crystals with smaller aspect ratios were formed, and at [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] = 30, plate-like crystals with lateral sizes of about 20 &#956;m were formed. Because the increase in [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] led to stabilization of metal complex and a decrease in the degree of supersaturation, the decrease in aspect ratio at [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] = 15&#8211;30 suggests that high degree of supersaturation is favable for the anisotropic growth. Therefore, controlling the degree of supersaturation by [ NN' -dmeda]/[Co 2+ ] enables the variation of the size and aspect ratio of columnar crystals. References (1) G. Chen, H. Wan, W. Ma, N.

                Abstract The efficient production of useful substances in plant factories is very attractive to secure the nutrition for human health in the future. The aim of this study was to investigate the growth behavior of rice sprouts to establish a high&#8208;density production system for plant factories. To clarify the material balance during the growth of sprout of brown rice, a single individual of rice was cultivated in vitro. The weight of the sample and the oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations in the test tube were measured, with bioactivity indices being calculated. The contribution of growth respiration was confirmed based on the growth, oxygen uptake, and carbon dioxide evolution rates. The specific growth rates and oxygen concentrations all increased during the 60&#8208; to 80&#8208;h period. The decrease in the specific oxygen uptake rate and carbon dioxide evaluation rate generally corresponded to the 90&#8208; to 160&#8208;h period. These results suggest that the physiological state of rice sprouts can be evaluated using bioactivity indices obtained from individual cultivation systems. A trial application for the high&#8208;density heterotrophic cultivation of rice sprouts was performed using the developed container. The growth productivity of rice sprouts cultivated in containers was similar to that of individual test tubes. These results showed the new value of crop cultivation by the plant factory.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary oxidation behavior of W-Zr thin-film metallic glasses: A
  route for tailoring functional properties of W-Zr-O films</title>

                The oxidation behavior of W-Zr thin-film metallic glasses (TFMGs) with 32, 48 and 61 at.% Zr, prepared by dc magnetron co-sputtering, was comprehensively studied after annealing in synthetic air. The study focuses on the effect of the annealing temperature (up to 600{\deg}C) on the oxidation process, oxygen saturation, structure evolution, and their subsequent impact on electrical, optical and mechanical properties. The findings reveal that controlled oxidation transforms W-Zr TFMGs into amorphous ceramic W-Zr-O films with substoichiometric compositions. This is a consequence of an oxidation process that does not proceed through the formation of a stoichiometric oxide layer on the surface of W-Zr TFMGs, acting as a diffusion barrier against fast oxidation, but leads to a gradual incorporation of oxygen across the film volume due to thermodynamics factors. Higher Zr content accelerates the oxygen incorporation and its depth uniformity in the films. As a result, the mechanical properties are significantly enhanced achieving hardness values of up to 17.5 GPa at approximately 50% oxygen saturation. Simultaneously, the electrical and optical properties are finely tuned with the resistivity and the extinction coefficient (measured at 550 nm) ranging from 1.7 to 95.7x10-4 Ohm.cm and 0.28 to 1.06, respectively.</description>

                We applied a highly accurate Density Functional Theory (DFT) method to obtain thermodynamic data for various water-nitrogen clusters. In combination with ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations and wavefunction analysis, we proposed a theoretical pathway for the evolution of nitrogen-water cation clusters, offering insights into the formation of oxidative environments. Our calculations reveal that nitrogen molecules can form weak bonds with certain hydrogen-oxygen cations, stabilizing key intermediates during hydroxyl radical transfer. This interaction alters the cluster&#8217;s evolution. Our findings show a clear map of how nitrogen-water cluster cations evolute and give radicals or other active redox reactants.</description>

                Abstract From a spectroscopic survey of candidate H ii regions in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) with MMT/Hectospec, we have identified 294 H ii regions using emission line ratios and calculated elemental abundances from strong-line diagnostics (values ranging from sub-solar to super-solar) producing both Oxygen and Nitrogen radial abundance gradients. The Oxygen gradient is relatively flat, while the Nitrogen gradient is significantly steeper, indicating a higher N/O ratio in M31&#8217;s inner regions, consistent with recent simulations of galaxy chemical evolution. No strong evidence was found of systematic galaxy-scale trends beyond the radial gradient. After subtracting the radial gradient from abundance values, we find an apparently stochastic and statistically significant scatter of standard deviation 0.06 dex, which exceeds measurement uncertainties. One explanation includes a possible collision with M32 200 - 800 Myrs ago. Using the two-point correlation function of the Oxygen abundance, we find that, similar to other spiral galaxies, M31 is well-mixed on sub-kpc scales but less so on larger (kpc) scales, which could be a result of an exponential decrease in mixing speed with spatial scale, and the aforementioned recent merger. Finally, the MMT spectroscopy is complemented by a dust continuum and CO survey of individual Giant Molecular Clouds, conducted with the Submillimeter Array. By combining the MMT and SMA observations, we obtain a unique direct test of the Oxygen abundance dependence of the &#945;&#8242;(12CO) factor which is crucial to convert CO emission to dust mass. Our results suggest that within our sample there is no trend of the &#945;&#8242;(12CO) with Oxygen abundance.</description>

      <title>A NIRS-Based Technique for Monitoring Brain Tissue Oxygenation in Stroke Patients</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/s24248175</link>

                Stroke is a global health issue caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, which leads to severe motor disabilities. Measuring oxygen levels in the brain tissue is crucial for understanding the severity and evolution of stroke. While CT or fMRI scans are preferred for confirming a stroke due to their high sensitivity, Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)-based systems could be an alternative for monitoring stroke evolution. This study explores the potential of fNIRS signals to assess brain tissue in chronic stroke patients along with rehabilitation therapy. To study the feasibility of this proposal, ten healthy subjects and three stroke patients participated. For signal acquisition, two NIRS sensors were placed on the forehead of the subjects, who were asked to remain in a resting state for 5 min, followed by a 30 s motor task for each hand, which consists of opening and closing the hand at a steady pace, with a 1 min rest period in between. Acomplete protocol for placing sensors and a signal processing algorithm are proposed. In healthy subjects, a measurable change in oxygen saturation was found, with statistically significant differences (females p = 0.016, males p = 0.005) between the resting-state and the hand movement conditions. This work showed the feasibility of the complete proposal, including the NIRS sensor, the placement, the tasks protocol, and signal processing, for monitoring the state of the brain tissue cerebral oxygenation in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation therapy. Thus this is a non-invasive barin assessment test based on fNIRS with the potential to be implemented in non-controlled clinical environments.</description>

By combining the MMT and SMA observations, we obtain a unique direct test of the Oxygen abundance dependence of the $\alpha^{\prime}(^{12}\mathrm{CO})$ factor which is crucial to convert CO emission to dust mass. Our results suggest that within our sample there is no trend of the $\alpha^{\prime}(^{12}\mathrm{CO})$ with Oxygen abundance.</description>

      <title>Diverse Transient Chiral Dynamics in Evolutionary Distinct Photosynthetic Reaction Centers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c01469</link>
      <description>Yanmei Yang, Zihui Liu, Fulu Zheng, Panpan Zhang, Hongxing He, Ajay Jha, Hong-Guang Duan, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405736006

                The evolution of photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) from anoxygenic bacteria to higher-order oxygenic cynobacteria and plants highlights a remarkable journey of structural and functional diversification as an adaptation to environmental conditions. The role of chirality in these centers is important, influencing the arrangement and function of key molecules involved in photosynthesis. Investigating the role of chirality may provide a deeper understanding of photosynthesis and the evolutionary history of life on Earth. In this study, we explore chirality-related energy transfer in two evolutionarily distinct RCs: one from the anoxygenic purple sulfur bacterium Thermochromatium tepidum (BRC) and the other from the oxygenic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vulcanus (PSII RC), utilizing two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES). By employing circularly polarized laser pulses, we can extract transient chiral dynamics within these RCs, offering a detailed view of their chiral contribution to energy transfer processes. We also compute traditional 2DES and compare these results with spectra related to circular dichroism. Our findings indicate that two-dimensional circular dichroism spectroscopy effectively reveals chiral dynamics, emphasizing the structural symmetries of pigments and their interactions with associated proteins. Despite having similar pigment&#8211;protein architectures, the BRC and PSII RC exhibit significantly different chiral dynamics on an ultrafast time scale. In the BRC, the complex contributions of pigments such as BChM, BPhL, BCh, and PM to key excitonic states lead to more pronounced chiral features and dynamic behavior. In contrast, the PSII RC, although significantly influenced by ChlD1 and ChlD2, shows less complex chiral effects and more subdued chiral dynamics. Notably, the PSII RC demonstrates a faster decay of coherence to localized excitonic populations compared to the BRC, which may represent an adaptive mechanism to minimize oxidative stress in oxygenic photosystems. By examining and comparing the chiral excitonic interactions and dynamics of BRC and PSII RC, this study offers valuable insights into the mechanisms of photosynthetic complexes. These findings could contribute to understanding how the functional optimization of photosynthetic proteins in ultrafast time scales is linked to biological evolution.</description>

                Abstract Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) is an important chemical in synthetic chemistry with huge demands. Photocatalytic synthesis of H 2 O 2 via oxygen reduction and water oxidation reactions (ORR and WOR) is considered as a promising and desirable solution for on&#8208;site applications. However, the efficiency of such a process is low due to the poor solubility of molecular oxygen and the rapid reverse reaction of hydroxyl radicals ( &#8226; OH) with hydrogen atoms (H). Here, a strategy is proposed to boost the H 2 O 2 evolution via oxidation of water by employing a H acceptor ( A , nitrocyclohexane), an &#8226; OH mediator ( M , dioxane), and a photocatalyst (CdS nanosheets). While &#8226; OH radicals are stabilized by dioxane to produce ketyl radicals prior to the formation of H 2 O 2 , H atoms are effectively utilized in the generation of cyclohexanone oxime, an important intermediate in the production of Nylon 6. The system displays a rapid kinetic accumulation of H 2 O 2 (0.13 min &#8722;1 ) to a high concentration (6.6 m M ). At optimum reaction conditions, a high quantum efficiency (16.6%) and light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency (4.9%) can be achieved under 410 nm irradiation.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical Production of Nitrite and Nitrate via Cathodic Oxygen Activation in Liquefied Ammonia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02563767mtgabs</link>
      <description>Moritz Krebs, Ferdi Sch&#252;th, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-02(56)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405640030

                Nitrite and nitrate play pivotal roles in industrial applications, being utilized in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, nylon precursors, explosives, and especially as fertilizer compounds. However, their synthesis primarily relies on the energy-intensive Ostwald process, which operates at high temperatures. Recently, there has been growing interest in producing nitrite and nitrate through the electrooxidation of ammonia. This method shows promise for enabling decentralized small-scale production under mild conditions while directly utilizing renewable energy sources. [1] However, production is currently restricted to low ammonia concentrations (typically 0.1 M) in aqueous systems while requiring high cell voltages. [2,3] An alternative yet unexplored concept is the electrooxidation of liquefied ammonia gas with molecular oxygen. This concept would enable nitrite and nitrate production at lower cell voltages without being restricted to low ammonia concentrations. In fact, the pioneering studies of Allen Bard have demonstrated that cathodic activation of gaseous oxygen in liquefied ammonia is possible. [4] Nonetheless, the possibility of producing nitrite and nitrate in liquefied ammonia has yet to be investigated. By using an autoclave for electrochemistry experiments, we are able to investigate the possibility of nitrite and nitrate synthesis at ammonia equilibrium pressures, elevated temperatures, and different oxygen partial pressures. [5] In a two-electrode configuration, a Pt coil and a Pt sheet (1cm x 1cm) are used as the cathode and anode, respectively. In this work, we utilize the high overpotential of Pt electrodes in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in liquefied ammonia to selectively form active oxygen species via the competitive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The so-formed oxygen species then react with the ammonium-containing electrolyte to form nitrogen oxides. By introducing 30 bars of pressure of O 2 (4%) in Ar, we observed a reduction in the overall cell voltage by approximately 800 mV at current densities of 20 mA cm -2 . After transferring 100 C of charge, ion chromatography (IC) confirms the formation of both nitrite and nitrate with formal faradaic efficiencies of 15% and 41%, respectively. Additional headspace analysis via diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) disproved the formation of significant amounts of gaseous NO x species. Via GC analysis, we confirmed that the ORR successfully suppresses the HER. At the same time, the Faraday efficiency towards the anodic nitrogen evolution (NER) is unchanged, indicating a solely cathodically driven reaction mechanism. To determine the role of in-situ formed water in the reaction mechanism, we conducted experiments examining the impact of water addition. These investigations revealed that adding water is advantageous in the presence of oxygen. However, when water was the exclusive source of oxygen, only trace amounts of nitrite were observed, and no nitrate was formed. This indicates that in-situ-formed water molecules are not the primary active species responsible for the production of nitrite and nitrate. Currently, we further study the reaction mechanism and the influence of different electrolyte salts and ammonium-ion concentrations on the nitrite and nitrate yield. In addition, experiments at various reaction temperatures have been conducted, further improving nitrite and nitrate efficiency. In summary, we present a novel method for the electrochemical formation of nitrite and nitrate in liquefied ammonia under equilibrium pressures, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first study of this kind. By exploring various reaction parameters, we additionally probe the impact of water content, reaction temperature, and different electrolyte salts on the yields of the nitrogen oxides, thereby advancing our understanding of the underlying reaction mechanism.

                Abstract The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (e&#8208;NRR) presents a promising approach for environmentally friendly ammonia synthesis. However, the efficiency of ammonia synthesis can be hindered by competitive hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). Therefore, the development of a catalyst capable of suppressing HER is essential. In this study, a synergistic hybrid catalyst Sr(Ti 0.6 Fe 0.4 ) 0.8 B 0.2 O 3&#8208;&#948; [S(TF)B 0.2 ], composed of Sr 3 B 2 O 6 (SB) and Sr y Ti 0.6 Fe 0.4 O 3&#8208;&#948; (S y TF, y&lt;1) is synthesized and used as an electrocatalyst for electrochemical ammonia synthesis via protonic ceramic electrolysis cells, in which SB is utilized as a proton acceptor, thereby inhibiting HER and promoting proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) for the ammonia synthesis. The formation of SB results in a deficiency of A&#8208;site cations in S y TF, leading to an increased number of oxygen vacancies in S(TF)B 0.2 . DFT calculation indicates that oxygen vacancies facilitate ammonia generation and desorption, adhering to the enzymatic pathway for NH 3 synthesis. Additionally, the grain boundary (GB) between S y TF and SB introduces further defects, which contribute to the enhancement of the eNRR. Research indicates that utilizing S(TF)B 0.2 as a catalyst enhances both the ammonia synthesis rate and Faradaic efficiency. This study presents a straightforward and efficient approach for the fabrication of eNRR catalysts.</description>

      <title>Magma Ocean Evolution at Arbitrary Redox State</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1029/2024je008576</link>
      <description>Harrison Nicholls, Tim Lichtenberg, Dan J. Bower, Raymond T. Pierrehumbert, Journal of Geophysical Research Planets. 129(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405736118

                Abstract Interactions between magma oceans and overlying atmospheres on young rocky planets leads to an evolving feedback of outgassing, greenhouse forcing, and mantle melt fraction. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the solidification of oxidized Earth&#8208;similar planets, but the diversity in mean density and irradiation observed in the low&#8208;mass exoplanet census motivate exploration of strongly varying geochemical scenarios. We aim to explore how variable redox properties alter the duration of magma ocean solidification, the equilibrium thermodynamic state, melt fraction of the mantle, and atmospheric composition. We develop a 1D coupled interior&#8208;atmosphere model that can simulate the time&#8208;evolution of lava planets. This is applied across a grid of fixed redox states, orbital separations, hydrogen endowments, and C/H ratios around a Sun&#8208;like star. The composition of these atmospheres is highly variable before and during solidification. The evolutionary path of an Earth&#8208;like planet at 1 AU ranges between permanent magma ocean states and solidification within 1 Myr. Recently solidified planets typically host &#8208; or &#8208;dominated atmospheres in the absence of escape. Orbital separation is the primary factor determining magma ocean evolution, followed by the total hydrogen endowment, mantle oxygen fugacity, and finally the planet's C/H ratio. Collisional absorption by induces a greenhouse effect which can prevent or stall magma ocean solidification. Through this effect, as well as the outgassing of other volatiles, geochemical properties exert significant control over the fate of magma oceans on rocky planets.</description>

                The development of efficient hydrogen production technology by water splitting electrolysis with low overvoltage is underway to realize a hydrogen society, and the development of a technology to precisely design and sheet the chemical structure along with catalyst development is very important to understand the electrocatalytic reaction mechanism such as hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reaction and the effect of gap spacing on the active site at the nanoscale. This is very important for visualizing and understanding the mechanisms of electrocatalytic reactions, such as hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction reactions (HER and ORR), and the effect of gap spacing on the active sites at the nanoscale. For example, it has been reported that ORR activity is enhanced on surfaces with adsorbed hydrophobic organic molecules on Pt compared to that on clean surfaces ( Nat. Commun. 2018, 9 , 4378). The effect of nanopores (vacancy sites) on the HER is unclear, although it is attributed to the limited reaction sites of Pt atoms owing to the adsorption of organic molecules. Furthermore, it is difficult to control the size of the nanopores and their dispersion (distance between nanopores) at the nano-level using a top-down approach, in which graphene sheets are mechanically and chemically processed, and a bottom-up 2D sheet fabrication method should be established. The development of a technique to precisely design chemical structures and fabricate sheets is important to understand the electrocatalytic reaction mechanism at the nanoscale and to visualize the effect of nanopore size and spacing on the active sites at the nanoscale. In this study, we investigated the formation of nanostructures by the intermolecular condensation of nanographene, such as ovalene and dicoronylene (Fig. 1), and investigated the thermal condensation conditions by adsorption on a Au(111) substrate under various conditions. The pore size of the nanostructures formed by ovalene and dicoronylene was characterized by using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). A clean Au (111) substrate was immersed in an ovalene- and/or dicoronylene-saturated benzene solution for 10 &#8211; 60 s, and the coated Au(111) electrode was investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements. The current density was significantly reduced before and after the vacuum heat treatment, suggesting that the ovalene molecules were rearranged on Au(111) and condensed between molecules. In addition, as a result of observation of the surface state in the atmosphere with STM, it was found before heating (Fig. 2a), confirming that the ovalene molecule was adsorbed over a wide area, and after heating (Fig. 2b), nanostructures with voids of 2.5 ~ 3 nm in diameter were observed. These results suggest that condensation may have occurred between the ovalene molecules due to heating, resulting in the formation of nanostructures with many nanopores. In contrast, dicoronylene forms a diamond-shaped lattice structure with sides of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 nm. Considering the molecular size of dicoronylene, it is difficult to judge whether intermolecular condensation among dicoronylene molecules occurred; however, the adlayer structure was different from that observed at room temperature. These results strongly suggest that intermolecular condensation reaction among ovalene and dicoronylene occurred on Au(111) upon elevating the temperature in vacuum. From the CV measurements, no significant change in the electric double-layer region was observed before and after the vacuum heating treatment; however, we found small change in the overpotential on the hydrogen evolution reaction.

                Four fundamental reactions are essential to harnessing energy from water sustainably: oxidation reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen reduction reaction (OER), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This review summarizes the research advancements in the electrocatalytic reaction of metal nanoclusters for water splitting. It covers various types of nanoclusters, particularly those at the size level, that enhance these catalytic reactions. The synthesis of cluster-based catalysts and the elucidation of the structure-activity relationships and reaction mechanisms are discussed. Emphasis is placed on utilizing atomically precise cluster materials and the interplay between the carrier and cluster in water catalysis, especially for applying catalytic engineering principles (such as synergy, coordination, heterointerface, and lattice strain engineering) to understand structure-activity relationships and catalytic mechanisms for cluster-based catalysts. Finally, the field of cluster water catalysis is summarized and prospected. We believe that developing cluster-based catalysts with high activity, excellent stability, and high selectivity will significantly promote the development of renewable energy conversion reactions.</description>

      <title>An Artificial Leaf That Generates Electricity: Coupling Photoelectro-Oxidation of Water to Bioelectro-Reduction of Oxygen</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02593996mtgabs</link>

                In this study, we demonstrate energy conversion in a device that couples photo- and bioelectrocatalysis. This device can be described as a photoelectrochemical biofuel cell where electricity is generated via photoelectrochemcial dioxygen evolution supplying substrate (i.e. dioxygen) for the oxydoreductase, laccase. This device mimics the photosynthetic process of leafs where the energy from sunlight is used to produce dioxygen and glucose, an energy-rich reaction product (electricity equivalent). The overall reaction of this system is the reversible interconversion of oxygen and water in a closed loop. This closed-loop device makes use of a photoanode of TiO 2 (rutile, single crystal) that generates dioxygen via photoelectrolysis of water when illuminated, thereby providing an internal substrate (i.e., cathodic dioxygen fuel) for the oxidoreductase, laccase. The cathode of this system consists of an electrode coated with a conducting polymer matrix entrapping laccase and a redox mediator, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiaxoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) (PAL-coated cathode), previously reported by our laboratory. The immobilization of the enzyme and its mediator eliminates the need for a separation membrane, allowing the anode and cathode to be located within the same compartment.</description>

      <title>Primary cilia as antennas for oxygen</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00298.2024</link>
      <description>Pascal Schneider, Joachim Fandrey, Tristan Leu, AJP Cell Physiology. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405706114

                Over the last few decades, the primary cilium, an inconspicuous cell organelle, has increasingly become the focus of current research. The primary cilium is a microtubule-based, non-motile, antenna-like structure that is present on almost all mammalian cells. The ciliary membrane incorporates a large number of receptor molecules, which further characterize this cellular organelle. These include receptors of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-, Wnt- or Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-signaling pathways. For this reason, as well as due to the fact that extracellular signaling molecules can bind to the ciliary membrane, primary cilia have been named &#8220;the antenna of the cell&#8221;. In addition to their signaling function, the association of ciliary dysfunctions with a variety of diseases, so-called ciliopathies, underscores the importance of this functional cellular structure. Recent studies have also implicated primary cilia in the adaptation to low&#8209;oxygen conditions, which are characteristic for ischemia, such as in stroke or myocardial infarction, or tumor entities. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of these multiple facets and to take a closer look at the evolution of an inconspicuous cell organelle to a major player in hypoxia.</description>

      <title>Study of the Influence of Thermal Annealing of Ga-Doped ZnO Thin Films on NO2 Sensing at ppb Level</title>

                In this paper, the sensitivity to sub-ppm NO2 concentration of 50 nm thick Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films grown by RF magnetron sputtering is studied. The films were annealed under dry air for 4 h at either 500 &#176;C, 600 &#176;C, or 700 &#176;C. The increase in the annealing temperature leads to an improvement of the crystallinity while no significant evolution of the surface grain size is observed. The electrical resistance of the thin films was measured at 250 &#176;C under neutral argon atmosphere, humid air reference atmosphere, and reference atmosphere polluted by 100 ppb of NO2. An increase in sensitivity to NO2 is noted for samples annealed at 600 &#176;C, leading to a response RNO2/Rair of ~10 for 100 ppb of NO2. Finally, photoluminescence spectra are compared with their electrical resistance at 250 &#176;C under the various atmospheres to understand this phenomenon. It is proposed that the origin of the NO2 maximum sensitivity for films annealed at 600 &#176;C is the consequence of a specific annihilation of point defects resulting in an increase in the relative concentration of oxygen vacancies, which improves selectivity toward NO2.</description>

      <title>3.08 billion-year-old crustal differentiation constrained by Sn and O isotopes of detrital cassiterite</title>

                Formation of granite-hosted tin deposits reflects the differentiation and maturation of continental crust. While rare in Earth's early continental crust, the eastern Kaapvaal Craton in southern Africa may harbor the oldest known tin-bearing granites. Here we present a perspective of early continental evolution from the study of Archean detrital cassiterite from the volcano-sedimentary continental cover succession of the Dominion Group of the western Kaapvaal Craton. The cassiterites yield a concordia age of 3084.7 &#177; 2.3 million-year-old, representing the oldest detrital cassiterite ever found. They are enriched in hafnium, zirconium, niobium, and tantalum, depleted in tungsten, and have overall consistent &#948;18O values (mostly 3&#8210;5&#8240;) but heterogeneous &#948;122/118Sn values (&#8722;0.59 to 0.79&#8240;). They likely originated from erosion of peraluminous granites, forming immediate basement of the Dominion Group. The occurrence of ~3.08 billion-year-old detrital cassiterite suggests widespread tin mineralization in the granites, the intrusion of which led to stabilization of the Kaapvaal craton. A detrital cassiterite found in the Kaapvaal Craton, South Africa, implies widespread tin mineralization and stabilization of granitic cratons approximately 3.08 billion years ago, as shown by U-Pb geochronology, trace element and oxygen and tin isotopes.</description>

      <title>Producing type Ia supernovae from hybrid CONe white dwarfs with main-sequence binary companions at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001</title>

                Abstract The nature of progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and their explosion mechanism remain unclear. It has been suggested that SNe Ia may be resulted from thermonuclear explosions of hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs (CONe WDs) when they grow in mass to approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit by accreting matter from a binary main-sequence (MS) companion. In this work, we combine the results of detailed binary evolution calculations with population synthesis models to investigate the rates and delay times of SNe Ia in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001. For a constant star formation rate of 5 M &#8857; yr -1 , our calculations predict that the SN Ia rates in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001 is about 0.11-3.89 &#215; 10 -4 yr -1 . In addition, delay times in this channel cover a wide range of 0.05-2.5 Gyr. We further compare our results to those given by previous study for the CONe WD + MS channel with higher metallicity of Z = 0.02 to explore the influence of metallicity on the results. We find that these two metallicity environments give a slight difference in rates and delay times of SNe~Ia from the CONe WD + MS channel, although SNe Ia produced at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001 have relatively longer delay times.</description>

                We report on a series of SrMo1-xMnxO3-&#948; perovskite oxides designed as potential anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). These materials were synthesized using a citrate method, yielding scheelite-type precursors with nominal SrMo1-xMnxO4 compositions, which were further reduced to obtain the active perovskite oxides. Their structural evolution was examined through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD). These techniques provided insights into the crystallographic changes upon Mn doping, revealing key factors influencing ionic conductivity. Whereas the oxidized scheelite precursors are tetragonal, space group I41/a, the reduced perovskite specimens are cubic, space group Pm-3m, and show the conspicuous absence of oxygen vacancies, even at the highest temperature of 800&#186;C. The transport properties were analyzed through electrical conductivity measurements, exhibiting a metallic-like behavior. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dilatometry give insights into the thermal stability and expansion behavior, essential for SOFC operation. Test single SOFC were built in an electrolyte-supported configuration, on LSGM pellets of 300m thickness, assessing the performance of the title materials as anodes. This work emphasizes the critical relationship between the crystal structure and its electrochemical behavior, providing a deeper understanding of how doping strategies can optimize fuel cell performance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Oxygen Catalytic Performance in Zinc-Air Batteries through Localized Micro-Interface Reconstruction of Cobalt-Manganese Spinel</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02483484mtgabs</link>
      <description>Nengneng Xu, Christabel Adjah-Tetteh, Yudong Wang, Zizhou He, Xiao&#8208;Dong Zhou, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-02(48)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405640663

                Reversible zinc-air batteries are widely regarded as one of the most promising candidates for clean energy conversion and storage technology owing to their cost-effectiveness, inherent safety, wide operating temperature window and high theoretical energy density.(1) In general, the performance of zinc-air batteries is heavily dependent on highly active bifunctional electrocatalysts, which effectively accelerate oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) kinetics. Among various electrocatalysts for advanced air cathodes, multivalent Co 3-x Mn x O 4&#177;&#948; oxides, as the representative mixed transition metal spinel, have attracted widespread interest because of their O 2 catalytic potential and diverse properties.(2) In comparison to the state-of-the-art Pt- and Ir-based catalysts, the catalytic performances of Co 3-x Mn x O 4&#177; &#948; remains constrained by its low electrical conductivity and inadequate ability to adsorb and activate O 2 .(3) Herein, we develop a unique pathway to achieve the self-reconstruction of the local micro-interface and electronic structure of Co 3-x Mn x O 4&#177;&#948; via a combustion reaction coupled with a high-temperature reduction process. The Co particles derived from the self-reconstructed Co x @Co 1.5-x Mn 1.5 O 4-&#948; catalyst not only facilitate the formation of a metal/oxide heterojunction active interface but also improve the electrical conductivity. More importantly, Co metal precipitated from the tetrahedral site with high spin electronic configuration induces the transformation of lattice oxygen into oxygen vacancies, thereby effectively accelerating reactant adsorption. As expected, the Co x @Co 1.5-x Mn 1.5 O 4-&#948; catalyst shows good ORR/OER activity with low overpotential. Furthermore, the zinc-air battery assembled by Co x @Co 1.5-x Mn 1.5 O 4-&#948; catalyst demonstrates an extended charge-discharge lifespan exceeding 1000 hours, significantly surpassing that of the Pt/C+Ir/C catalyst (100 hours). The primary factor contributing to its high stability is the dimensional growth following catalyst reconstitution. This work offers novel insights into enhancing the small molecule electrocatalytic performance of typical mixed transition metal oxides, including spinel and perovskite catalysts. References A.

      <title>(Invited) Improvement in Dynamic Operational Stability of Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1149/ma2024-02493504mtgabs</link>

                The significant advantages of alkaline electrolyzers, including their maturity, large capacity, and cost-effectiveness, have garnered considerable attention as viable applications for energy storage systems linked to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. These attributes offer economic benefits for managing fluctuations in electrical loads by storing excess energy as hydrogen, serving as an efficient energy carrier, particularly in long-term and large-scale storage systems. However, the fluctuating loads stemming from renewable power sources can impact electrolysis performance and potentially affect overall durability. Here, we will discuss improvements in the dynamic operational stability of alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE), mainly focusing on the electrodes, analyzing degradation phenomena. This analysis was conducted from the perspective of material design disciplines, combined with computational engineering and X-ray spectroscopic analysis. The dynamic operational stability of the screened electrodes in alkaline solutions was evaluated using accelerated test protocols. Importantly, no significant oxygen &amp; hydrogen evolution reaction performance degradation was observed after the lab-scale dynamic operation tests, and no structural deformation or metal ion dissolution were found to occur. Furthermore, these electrodes were scalable up to an area of 2,500 cm2 and could be evaluated in electrolyzer stacks of 100 kW or higher. We believe that enhancing poor kinetic efficiency and mitigating component degradation would extend the system's lifetime, thereby improving the economics of alkaline water electrolysis.</description>

                Controlling trap depth is crucial to improve photocatalytic activity, but designing such crystal structures has been challenging. In this study, we discovered that in 2D materials like BiOCl and Bi4NbO8Cl, composed of interleaved [Bi2O2]2+ and Cl&#8208; slabs, the trap depth can be controlled by manipulating the slab stacking structure. In BiOCl, oxygen vacancies (VO) create deep electron traps, while chlorine vacancies (VCl) produce shallow traps. The depth is determined by the coordination around anion vacancies: VO forms strong &#963; bonds with Bi&#8208;6p dangling bonds below the conduction band minimum (CBM), while those around Cl are parallel, forming weak &#960;&#8208;bonding. The strong re&#8208;hybridization makes the trap depth deeper. In Bi4NbO8Cl, VCl also creates shallow traps, but VO does not produce deep traps although Bi&#8208;6p orbitals are also forming strong &#963; bonding. This difference is attributed to the difference of energy level of CBM. In both cases, CBM consists of Bi&#8208;6p orbitals extending into the Cl layers. However, these orbitals are isolated in BiOCl, but those in Bi4NbO8Cl are bonded with each other between neighboring [Bi2O2]2+ layers. This unique bonding&#8208;based CBM prevents the formation of deep electron traps, and significantly enhances H2 evolution activity by prolonging lifetime of highly reactive free electrons.</description>

      <title>Effect of pressurization on bubble dynamics of photoelectrochemical water splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0237629</link>
      <description>Xinyi Luo, Qiang Xu, Tengfei Nie, Yonglu She, Liejin Guo, Physics of Fluids. 36(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405734653

                Energy consumption of hydrogen production significantly restricts the practical application of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting technology for hydrogen production, despite its vital role in addressing the energy crisis. The direct high-pressure hydrogen production technology holds promise for reducing production costs and streamlining the overall process. This paper delved into the study of bubble dynamic characteristics of PEC water splitting reaction under elevated pressure operations by coupling a photoelectrochemical system with a high-speed microscopic camera. The results prove that the bubble growth behaviors are pressure-dependent. Pressurization leads to the simultaneous evolution of multiple bubbles along with bubble slip and coalescence on the photoelectrode surface. And the bubble detachment diameter and growth period are significantly reduced, suggesting that increasing pressure is conducive to promoting bubble detachment. Analysis of the results of linear sweep voltammetry and Tafel slope shows that elevated pressure leads to more challenging bubble nucleation. Furthermore, the time coefficient and growth coefficient of the bubble growth stage are computed, revealing that the diffusion-controlled stage dominates the bubble growth process post-pressurization. A force balance model is constructed in the initial process of bubble rising, and it is found that the terminal rise velocity of bubbles decreases when pressure increases. The effect of pressure on gas density was considered to calculate the gas production rate by bubble volume and growth period, discovering that the proportion of gas products in the form of dissolved oxygen in the liquid increases significantly under high pressure.</description>

                Abstract Recently, metal&#8208;based atomically thin materials (M&#8208;ATMs) have experienced rapid development due to their large specific surface areas, abundant electrochemically accessible sites, attractive surface chemistry, and strong in&#8208;plane chemical bonds. These characteristics make them highly desirable for energy&#8208;related conversion reactions. However, the insufficient active sites and slow reaction kinetics leading to unsatisfactory electrocatalytic performance limited their commercial application. To address these issues, defect engineering of M&#8208;ATMs has emerged to increase the active sites, modify the electronic structure, and enhance the catalytic reactivity and stability. This review provides a comprehensive summary of defect engineering strategies for M&#8208;ATM nanostructures, including vacancy creation, heteroatom doping, amorphous phase/grain boundary generation, and heterointerface construction. Introducing recent advancements in the application of M&#8208;ATMs in electrochemical small molecule conversion reactions (e.g., hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfur), which can contribute to a circular economy by recycling molecules like H 2 , O 2 , CO 2 , N 2 , and S. Furthermore, a crucial link between the reconstruction of atomic&#8208;level structure and catalytic activity via analyzing the dynamic evolution of M&#8208;ATMs during the reaction process is established. The review also outlines the challenges and prospects associated with M&#8208;ATM&#8208;based catalysts to inspire further research efforts in developing high&#8208;performance M&#8208;ATMs.</description>

                Abstract Ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts are promising candidates for assembling high&#8208;performance anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) while their intrinsic activities are restricted due to the strong Ru&#9472;H bond strength. Herein, we present the synthesis and stabilization of electron&#8208;deficient Ru nanoclusters on oxygen&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotube (Ru/O&#8208;CNT) via strong electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI) toward highly efficient and stable alkaline HER. A scalable high&#8208;temperature shock method is used to anchor Ru nanoclusters on O&#8208;CNT, which suppresses the aggregation of Ru clusters and the loss of O anion during synthesis, thus strengthening the EMSI between the two components via Ru&#8211;O&#8211;C link. The strong EMSI helps to stabilize Ru at electron&#8208;deficient state at reductive potentials and optimizes the Ru&#9472;H bond strength. Consequently, Ru/O&#8208;CNT delivers outstanding performances for alkaline HER with a small overpotential of 10 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , which is superior to the benchmark Pt/C and most reported Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts. More impressively, an AEMWE assembled with Ru/O&#8208;CNT as cathode achieves high current densities of 1 and 5 A cm &#8722;2 at low cell voltages of 1.68 and 2.09 V, respectively, at a Ru mass loading of only 20 &#181;g cm &#8722;2 .</description>

                Abstract. Developing reliable methods for quantifying past temperature changes is essential for understanding Earth's climate evolution and predicting future climatic shifts. The degree of methylation of branched tetraethers (MBT&#8217;5ME), of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), a group of bacterial membrane lipids, has become a widely accepted tool for lacustrine paleothermometry. To allow this, an empirical calibration was developed, based on MBT&#8217;5ME values of surface sediments across large spatial scales. As these sediments integrate variability across several years to decades, the sensitivity of MBT&#8217;5ME to seasonal and short-term environmental changes in the water column remains underexplored. Here, we present a record of brGDGTs in suspended particulate matter (SPM) from a monomictic, eutrophic temperate lake (Rotsee, Switzerland) over a 10-month period, examining both core lipids and intact polar lipids. Rotsee offers an ideal setting for this study due to its strong seasonal variations in temperature, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen caused by summer warming and associated stratification. In the oxic epilimnion, a minor increase in MBT'5ME during stratified summer months was caused by a rise in brGDGT Ia concentration. A similar increase in concentration of 6-methyl brGDGTs indicates a sensitivity to water temperature. In the seasonally anoxic hypolimnion, MBT'5ME correlated with water pH rather than temperature, suggesting that water chemistry influences this ratio, complicating its use as a temperature proxy. The production of intact polar lipid (IPL) tetraethers was observed exclusively in the anoxic hypolimnion during stratification, confirming anoxia as a key trigger for IPL tetraether production. Surface sediment samples along a depth gradient have a distinct depth-dependent distribution. Sediments below the oxic water column showed lower MBT'5ME values, likely due to the sedimentary production of brGDGTs IIa and IIIa. Sediments from seasonally anoxic areas reflected average epilimnion SPM values, suggesting the deposition of epilimnion brGDGTs into the sediments. This study of brGDGTs in Rotsee SPM and sediments thus indicates that temperature, pH and oxygen concentration impact GDGT distribution, with significant implications for using MBT'5ME as a temperature proxy in sediments from stratified lakes.</description>

                Producing clean energy is one of the world's greatest challenges today. The use of solar energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen is therefore of great interest. In addition to semiconductor materials, heterogenized molecular catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and water oxidation catalysts (WOC) have attracted considerable interest. The development and design of artificial molecular devices (i.e. artificial photosynthesis systems) using visible light requires the heterogenization of catalysts (CAT) and photosensitizers (PS). However, the correlation of structural heterogeneity, leaching of active components and degradation processes during illumination, as well as the continuous monitoring of reactivity have not been fully addressed. 1,2 Scanning electrochemical probe microscopy such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), scanning electrochemical cell microscopy (SECCM), and scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy (SPEM), have been used to map light-driven water splitting and local electron transfer kinetics under in situ and operando conditions. 3-5 In this contribution, we present the deposition of mixed CAT/PS nanowires using earth-abundant BPh 2 -bridged, organometallic cobaloxime CATs and Ru-based ([Ru(tbbpy) 2 (mmip)]Cl 3 ) PS on various substrates using SECCM. Based on different studies an cabolime microarrays 6 , the nanowires are characterized with respect to their stabilty, elemental composition as well as their light-driven H 2 evolution activity. The H 2 evolution of nanowire arrays is imaged via SECM using Pd- and Pt-Black modified microelectrodes. In addition, submicron-sized electrocatalytically active cantilever-based probes, recently developed by our group, are used for improved lateral resolution. These probes can be used for colloidal force spectroscopy 7,8 providing nanomechanical properties of the studied materials. A thorough characterisation of the cantilever-based sensors will be presented together with nanomechanical and activity mapping of nanowires with different CAT/PS ratios. References: 1 C. Kranz, M.

                Abstract. Developing reliable methods for quantifying past temperature changes is essential for understanding Earth's climate evolution and predicting future climatic shifts. The degree of methylation of branched tetraethers (MBT&#8217;5ME), of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), a group of bacterial membrane lipids, has become a widely accepted tool for lacustrine paleothermometry. To allow this, an empirical calibration was developed, based on MBT&#8217;5ME values of surface sediments across large spatial scales. As these sediments integrate variability across several years to decades, the sensitivity of MBT&#8217;5ME to seasonal and short-term environmental changes in the water column remains underexplored. Here, we present a record of brGDGTs in suspended particulate matter (SPM) from a monomictic, eutrophic temperate lake (Rotsee, Switzerland) over a 10-month period, examining both core lipids and intact polar lipids. Rotsee offers an ideal setting for this study due to its strong seasonal variations in temperature, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen caused by summer warming and associated stratification. In the oxic epilimnion, a minor increase in MBT'5ME during stratified summer months was caused by a rise in brGDGT Ia concentration. A similar increase in concentration of 6-methyl brGDGTs indicates a sensitivity to water temperature. In the seasonally anoxic hypolimnion, MBT'5ME correlated with water pH rather than temperature, suggesting that water chemistry influences this ratio, complicating its use as a temperature proxy. The production of intact polar lipid (IPL) tetraethers was observed exclusively in the anoxic hypolimnion during stratification, confirming anoxia as a key trigger for IPL tetraether production. Surface sediment samples along a depth gradient have a distinct depth-dependent distribution. Sediments below the oxic water column showed lower MBT'5ME values, likely due to the sedimentary production of brGDGTs IIa and IIIa. Sediments from seasonally anoxic areas reflected average epilimnion SPM values, suggesting the deposition of epilimnion brGDGTs into the sediments. This study of brGDGTs in Rotsee SPM and sediments thus indicates that temperature, pH and oxygen concentration impact GDGT distribution, with significant implications for using MBT'5ME as a temperature proxy in sediments from stratified lakes.</description>

      <title>In preprints: oxygen and NF&#954;B signals shift the timing of hindlimb formation</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.204578</link>
      <description>Alberto Rosell&#243;&#8208;D&#237;ez, Sergio Menchero, Development. 151(24)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405631333

                Broadly conserved developmental programmes have been challenged with modifications throughout evolution, generating phenotypic diversification. A big part of this diversification arises from changes in the timing, order and speed in the formation of tissues, which together are included under the umbrella term heterochrony (Gould et al., 1977; Smith, 2002). Despite their relevance from an evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo) perspective, the molecular mechanisms behind heterochrony remain unsolved, partly due to the practical challenges of cross-species comparisons.Limb development in tetrapods has often been used as a system to examine the mechanisms underlying similarities and differences in morphogenetic events, because a vast diversity can emerge from the limb's highly conserved and well-characterised developmental programmes. This system allows comparisons between species but also within individuals, by contrasting forelimb and hindlimb development. The differences between forelimb and hindlimb are not only characterised by their position along the anterior-posterior axis but also by their timing of formation and growth. The relative time sequence of forelimb and hindlimb formation varies by class. Aves develop both limbs synchronously, Amphibia develop hindlimbs first, and Mammalia develop forelimbs first, with marsupials showing the most extreme forelimb prioritisation (Bininda-Emonds et al., 2007; Chew et al., 2014).In a recent preprint, Zhu and colleagues compare chicken and mouse limb development to investigate the mechanisms behind limb heterochrony (Zhu et al., 2024 preprint). Two T-box transcription factors, Tbx5 and Tbx4, are known key players in the initiation of forelimb- and hindlimb-forming fields, respectively (Agarwal et al., 2003; Logan et al., 1998). Using RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR RNA-FISH), the authors quantified Tbx5 and Tbx4 transcripts to determine their expression dynamics across a time course in chicken and mouse embryos. While the expression dynamics of both factors were almost synchronous in chicken embryos, Tbx4 expression in the mouse hindlimb was delayed by around 18 h relative to Tbx5 in the mouse forelimb. However, upstream regulators of Tbx4, including Pitx1 and Isl1, were expressed synchronously with Tbx5, suggesting that a delay in the expression of known upstream factors did not cause the delay in Tbx4 expression.Species-specific cis-regulatory elements can control the timing of expression of a particular gene. For example, a marsupial-specific sequence promotes the early activation of Sox9 in the opossum neural crest (Wakamatsu and Suzuki, 2019). Zhu and colleagues investigated the influence of cis-regulatory elements by identifying chicken Tbx4 enhancers and comparing their activity to known mouse Tbx4 enhancers. Using elegant enhancer-swap experiments to test the activity of mouse enhancers in the chicken embryo, and vice versa, the authors confirmed that these elements were functionally equivalent, being activated at the expected time and place in both species. These experiments ruled out the possibility that sequence variation between enhancers would be responsible for the temporal shift in Tbx4, but different factors binding to those elements could still drive it. To identify differentially expressed factors that could act as Tbx4 regulators, the authors performed forelimb and hindlimb bulk RNA-seq analyses in mouse and chicken embryos at the time of forelimb and hindlimb initiation. These analyses identified cRel (Rel), an effector of the NF&#954;B signalling pathway, as a potential Tbx4 repressor. Overexpression of cRel in chicken embryos resulted in a reduction in hindlimb bud size and lower Tbx4 expression. Conversely, cRel knockout mouse embryos showed scarce but earlier expression of Tbx4 in the hindlimb field. The authors reasoned that the low penetrance could be due to the compensatory role of other NF&#954;B effectors such as RelA (Rela).Zhu et al. then analysed oxygen levels as a potential upstream regulator of NF&#954;B signalling based on a link in other cellular contexts (Jiang et al., 2015; Yin and Juurlink, 2000). Furthermore, they argued that oxygen conditions are different during chicken (normoxia) and early mouse (hypoxia) development. Once the mouse placenta is functional, the embryo has access to higher oxygen levels, and this correlates with the timing of hindlimb formation. These observations prompted the authors to test whether oxygen levels could influence the timing of hindlimb initiation. They collected mouse embryos at embryonic day (E) 6.75 and cultured them ex utero under normoxic (20% oxygen) and hypoxic (5% oxygen) conditions for 1.5 days (ending the culture at the equivalent of &#8764;E8.25; i.e. before normal Tbx4 expression takes place in vivo). Remarkably, Tbx4 expression was initiated in mouse embryos cultured in normoxic conditions, but not in those cultured in hypoxic conditions. Concomitantly, cRel expression levels were higher in embryos cultured in hypoxic conditions, sustaining its repressor role.These interesting observations support the idea that hypoxic conditions could delay the expression of Tbx4 in the mouse hindlimb and raise more questions about the direct or indirect link between hypoxia, NF&#954;B signalling and the Tbx4 enhancers. Moreover, this work opens up an exciting evolutionary perspective where one could investigate the timing of hindlimb formation in other mammals in which the maturation of the placenta occurs at different time points or in those where the placenta capacity, and thus the oxygen supply, is limited. Similarly, comparisons between oviparous and viviparous lizards could reveal whether the presence of a placenta delays hindlimb induction in closely related species. Interestingly, a small delay in hindlimb outgrowth can be inferred from the description of developmental hallmarks in Eremias multiocellata, a viviparous lizard, although some oviparous lizards also develop forelimbs slightly earlier (Lin et al., 2021).An interesting observation of Zhu and colleagues is that, when cRel was knocked out in mouse, the low-penetrant premature expression of Tbx4 always happened on one side of the embryo. This result is reminiscent of the left-specific defects that a moderate loss of function of Tbx5 &#8211; or of its upstream regulator retinoic acid &#8211; has been shown to generate in mouse embryos (Niederreither et al., 2002; Sulaiman et al., 2016). It remains to be determined whether this indicates that retinoic acid had an ancestral role in controlling limb induction, which was superseded in the hindlimb when the hypoxia/NF&#954;B axis took over.HIF1&#945;, a hypoxia response transcription factor, is needed later for early chondrogenesis in the limb bud (Provot et al., 2007). Therefore, oxygen levels could regulate different steps in limb morphogenesis; however, it is unclear if and how oxygen, HIF and NF&#954;B factors coordinate the progression of these programmes.</description>

                Abstract As the demand for cleaner energy becomes a paramount objective of sustainable development, the advancement of cutting&#8208;edge engineered materials for a wide range of applications becomes increasingly vital. Tailoring catalyst properties through precise design and electronic state tuning is essential for adapting these materials to large&#8208;scale energy applications. Given this, an effective electronic fine&#8208;tuning (EFT) strategy is presented to optimize the electronic structures of single&#8208;atom Zn site and Ru species, synergistically enhancing the both electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefiting from the interaction between Ru species anchored on hierarchically layered nanosheets and isolated Zn atoms (Ru@Zn&#8208;SAs/N&#8208;C), the catalyst exhibits superior ORR and HER activities compared to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm a novel EFT effect between a single Zn site and Ru species, that enables the Ru@Zn&#8208;SAs/N&#8208;C approaches the optimal scaling relation between * OOH and * OH, breaking the universal ORR scaling limitation. Additionally, the optimal G H* value positions Ru@Zn&#8208;SAs/N&#8208;C near the apex of the theoretical HER volcano model. This work provides an innovative avenue for regulating the electronic localization of catalytic active centers by virtue of carbon substrate and offers valuable insights for designing high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Ongoing loss of viable neurons for weeks after mild perinatal hypoxia-ischemia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.19.629457</link>

                Mild hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is common in neonates with no evidence-based therapies, and 30-40% of patients experience adverse outcomes. The nature and progression of mild injury is poorly understood. Thus, we studied the evolution of mild perinatal brain injury using longitudinal two-photon imaging of transgenic fluorescent proteins as a novel readout of neuronal viability and activity at cellular resolution. In vitro, perinatal murine organotypic hippocampal cultures underwent 15-20 minutes of oxygen-glucose deprivation. In vivo, mild hypoxia-ischemia was completed in post-natal day 10 mouse pups of both sexes with carotid ligation and 15 minutes of hypoxia. Consistent with a mild injury, minimal immediate neuronal death was seen and there was no volumetric evidence of injury by ex vivo MRI 2.5 weeks after injury. In both the hippocampus and neocortex, these mild injuries resulted in a significantly delayed and progressive neuronal loss in the second week after injury, measured by fluorophore quenching. Mild hypoxia-ischemia transiently suppressed cortical network activity followed by normal maturation. No post-injury seizures were seen. The participation in network activity of individual neurons destined to die was indistinguishable from those that survived for 4 days post-injury. In conclusion, our results showed that mild perinatal brain injury resulted in a prolonged increase of neuronal death. Neurons that died late were functioning normally for days after injury, suggesting a new pathophysiology of neuronal death. Critically, the neurons destined to die late demonstrated multiple biomarkers of viability long after mild injury, suggesting their later death may be modified with neuroprotective interventions.</description>

      <title>IL-1&#946; primed mesenchymal stromal cells moderate hemorrhagic shock-induced vascular permeability</title>

                Hemorrhagic shock (HS) corresponds to absolute hypovolemia creating an imbalance between oxygen supply and consumption. This causes an impaired hemostasis, a systemic inflammatory response, and microvascular permeability which can lead to multiple organ failure (MOF). There is no specific treatment for the endothelial dysfunction that plays a major role in the evolution towards MOF. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been used in clinical trials for their immunomodulation and tissue repair capabilities for many years. Moreover, we previously showed that IL-1&#946;-primed-MSC (MSCp) attenuated HS-induced organ injuries. The objective of the study was to determine whether MSCp could prevent the onset of MOF after HS by preventing endothelial dysfunction. We established a rat model of HS, inducing 90 min of HS at a fixed mean arterial pressure of 35 mmHg, followed by resuscitation and transfusion. MSCp treatment was administered intravenously at the onset of resuscitation. After 6 h, we assessed plasma levels of endothelial markers, vascular permeability using Evans Blue (EB) dye, and renal and hepatic water content by measuring the wet-to-dry weight difference. Additionally, we investigated the ability of MSCp to inhibit leukocyte adhesion to activated endothelium in vitro. Our results indicate that early administration of MSCp significantly reduced the percentage of water content and EB dye in the liver but not in the kidney. These results were associated with a trend toward decreased plasma levels of Syndecan-1, ICAM-1, vWF, and VCAM-1. In vitro, MSCp reduced leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion. Together, our results suggest that MSCp help to prevent endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage, which, in turn, could protect the liver from injury.</description>

                An efficient multi-functional electrolyzer with an electrodeposited Ni- and Fe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) anode and an electrodeposited NiMo cathode is designed for overall water splitting coupled with the desalination of saline water and production of acid and base solution. NiFe-LDH is characterized by abundant active sites for OH adsorption and an optimal binding energy for M-OH. Meanwhile, loading bimetallic NiMo on an active electrode for the HER has been known to improve the electrocatalytic activity and durability owing to its high surface area. The NiFe-LDH and NiMo pairs separated by a bipolar membrane (BPM) show overpotentials as low as those of noble metal catalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reactions in 1 M KOH and 1 M H 2 SO 4 solutions, respectively. Thereafter, the electrode pair with an array of anion- and cation-exchange membranes (AEMs and CEMs) in alternatively stacking manner showed the desalination of brackish water and seawater at specific energy consumption of 1.8 kW h m &#8722;3 , with concurrent production of HCl and NaOH. The Faradaic efficiencies of the device for O 2 and H 2 production are &gt;95% at J = 100 mA cm &#8722;2 over 20 h, while the initial pH values of the anolyte and catholyte remain unchanged. The proposed multi-functional electrolyzer is highly promising for converting electrical energy into hydrogen energy, simultaneously desalinating saline water, and producing value-added chemicals. Subsequently, we compared electrodialytic performance over unit cell thickness, types of ion exchange membranes, and number of stacks in the device.

                Electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies, which include fuel cells, electrolyzers, batteries, photoelectrochemical devices are at the forefront of the transition to a sustainable future. Although they have all been in use for more than half a century, they are far from reaching their full potential as defined by the laws of thermodynamics. Their performance rests almost entirely on the electrochemical interface - the boundary between the electronic conductor (electrode) and the ionic conductor (electrolyte). The desire of both phases to reduce the surface energy as well as the appearance of electrochemical potential across the interface can manifest itself as the formation of unique (near)surface atom arrangements (e.g. surface relaxation or reconstruction), as significant differences in electrode composition close to the surface (e.g. segregation profile), via substrate-adsorbate covalent and non-covalent interactions, via formation of a passive film as well as ordering of solvent and/or electrolyte molecules several nm away from the surface. This extremely complex and sensitive "interfacial bridge", is a consequence of inherent incompatibility of two materials, brought into contact, and is very hard to control. However, to control it means to control the energy efficiency, power density, durability and safety &#8211; the most important metrics of any energy conversion and storage device. In this presentation we will discuss, how the chemical nature of non-covalently and covalently [1,2] adsorbed species as well as thicker passive films and their morphology at the electrochemical interface affect the individual terms of the common rate equation [1], including the free energy of adsorbed intermediates and adsorbed spectators, mass transport, availability of active sites and electronic and ionic resistivity for common electrocatalytic reactions in acid and alkaline aqueous as well as in non-aqueous media on a plethora of metal electrodes (Pt, Ir, Au, Ni, Cu) as well as carbon. We will draw parallels between HER, OER, HOR and ORR in electrolyzers [1], fuel cells [2] and Li-ion batteries [3,4]. The interphase properties will be discussed through the lens of deviations of modified electrode properties from its intrinsic properties. Examples of artificially modified interfaces [5,6] will be given to demonstrate our ability to tailor their activity, stability and selectivity to our liking. [1] Strmcnik, D.

                There has been growing interest in the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), a potent greenhouse gas and a contributor to global climate change, and its conversion into useful carbon-based fuels or chemicals. Numerous homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic systems have been proposed to induce the CO 2 reduction and, depending on the reaction conditions various products that include carbon monoxide, oxalate, formate, carboxylic acids, formaldehyde, acetone or methanol, in addition to various hydrocarbons at different ratios. Given the fact that the CO 2 molecule is very stable, its electroreduction processes are characterized by large overpotentials. To produce highly efficient and selective electrocatalysts, the transition-metal-based molecular materials are often considered. It is believed that, during electroreduction, the rate limiting step is the protonation of the adsorbed CO product to form the CHO adsorbate. Because reduction of CO 2 can effectively occur by hydrogenation, to optimize the conventional copper-based electrocatalytic approach, we explore such a model catalytic matrix as nanostructured tungsten oxide nanowires which are capable to undergo partial reduction to hydrogen-rich nonstoichiometric tungsten oxide bronzes. We demonstrate here that following the ntercalation of copper into tungsten(VI)-oxide-nanowires, the resulting electrocatalytic systems exhibits synergistic properties toward electroreduction of carbon dioxide, in addition to other inert inorganic reactants, such as oxygen, nitrates(V), nitrates(III) or bromates(V). In particular, evidence has been provided that hierarchically deposited films (on glassy carbon) of copper(I) oxide decorated with tungsten(VI) oxide nanowires and, subsequently, subjected to electroreduction and voltammetric conditioning to generate hybrid Cu/WO 3 catalyst can be successfully utilized to drive reduction of carbon dioxide (saturated solution, concentration, ca. 0.033 mol dm -3 )in a fairly strong acid medium of 0.5 mol dm -3 H 2 SO 4 . Here formation of the partially reduced tungsten oxides (H x WO 3 and WO 3-y ) is accompanied by consumption of protons and sorption of hydrogen, and it tends to inhibit hydrogen evolution by shifting the proton discharge toward more negative potentials. Our observations are consistent with the view that copper is irreversibly trapped (i.e., it cannot be reoxidized) within the network of WO 3 nanowires. The dispersed metallic copper sites seem to facilitate electron transfers and charge distribution in the catalytic layers. Among important issues are the capacity of copper-containing partially reduced tungsten oxides to induce reductions of nitrates, bromates and oxygen in acid medium. On mechanistic grounds, the existence of hydrogen-rich partially-reduced tungsten oxides, H x WO 3 , which contain large population of delocalized electrons and monoatomic H, or coexisting protons and electrons, H + + e - , is likely to induce hydrogenation of carbon oxo species, followed by protonation, in the vicinity of Cu to form oxo-hydrocarbon-type products. The hybrid Cu/WO 3 system, is also characterized by improved durability, relative to pristine Cu 2 O-dervied copper, as evident from electroreductions under chronoamperometric conditions. Our research aiming at optimization the material&#8217;s activity and selectivity have also concentrated on application of mixed oxides, e.g. WO 3 -ZrO 2 . Finally, the present study demonstrates the usefulness of certain diagnostic electroanalytical approaches, such as ultramicroelectrode-based sensing,chronocoulometric probing of the diffusional-type charge propagation dynamics , or voltammetric stripping and monitoring of small organic or inorganic molecules as electroreduction products.</description>

These batteries offer enhanced safety, stability, and potential for high energy density, addressing limitations of conventional liquid-state designs, such as flammability and side reactions under operational conditions. This perspective reviews the latest advancements in solid-state Li-O2 batteries, focusing on performance metrics such as cycle life, areal capacity, and current density. Material selections from recent studies are examined. Key reporting practices, such as liquid content, operation temperature, availability of differential electrochemical mass spectrometry results, and reporting completeness on loading information are summarized. Additionally, relationships among various performance metrics are explored. Despite significant progress, solid-state Li-O2 batteries continue to face limitations with low current densities and limited cycle capacities, indicating that existing materials and designs have yet to fully exploit the technology's theoretical potential. This analysis highlights areas for future research, particularly in stability and interfacial engineering, to bridge the gap toward commercially viable, high-energy-density solid-state Li-O2 batteries. Download figure Download PowerPoint Introduction In recent years, the global push to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources has significantly boosted the demand for next-generation energy storage devices. As a critical component of these devices, battery technology has become central to meeting the increasing energy density requirements brought by advancements in electric vehicles (EVs), commercial aviation, locomotives, and portable electronics. The lithium-oxygen battery (LOB) is recognized for having the highest theoretical energy density among current battery technologies, capable of delivering a specific energy of up to 5.2 kWh/kg, far exceeding the energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries.1&#8211;3 A typical liquid-state LOB generally comprises a lithium metal anode, a separator, a porous cathode, and an electrolyte.4 In the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharge, lithium atoms lose electrons on the anode and become Li+ ions, which are then transported to the cathode to react with O2 and electrons, forming lithium peroxide (Li2O2). In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charging, Li2O2 decomposes into Li+ ions and O2; the Li+ ions then diffuse back to the anode, where they gain electrons to reform lithium metal. Liquid electrolytes facilitate faster Li+ ion transport and maintain excellent contact between active materials, enabling efficient electrochemical reactions. However, liquid-state LOBs are limited to electrolyte instability, parasitic reactions with oxygen, and safety concerns related to flammability, which hinder their long-term performance and reliability. Solid-state LOBs utilize solid electrolytes, which improve electrolyte stability, extend cycle life, and enhance potential energy density. Solid electrolytes are less flammable than liquid electrolytes, providing greater safety and stability by reducing degradation and minimizing undesirable side reactions with oxygen. Additionally, the compact design and lighter weight of the electrolyte in solid-state LOBs enable higher potential energy density. Solid-state electrolytes can also mitigate lithium dendrite formation and provide better compatibility with lithium metal anodes, both of which are essential for maximizing energy density.5,6 Though promising, several challenges restrict the energy density and practical applications of solid-state LOBs. These challenges include interfacial impedance between battery component layers, the stability of solid-state electrolytes when exposed to air, low ionic conductivity, compatibility and reactivity with lithium metal, and scalability of production processes.7&#8211;14 Researchers have attempted to address these challenges by exploring various materials for solid-state electrolyte (SSE), adding interlayers between electrodes, incorporating small amount of liquid electrolytes, and operating cells at temperatures above room temperature.15 Despite the growing diversity of material choices and significant improvements in cell performance, the path to achieving practical, high-energy-density solid-state LOBs remains distant. In this article, we will summarize recent research progress and trends, examine key reporting practices and experimental conditions, and explore the correlation among various performance metrics. All discussions are based on quantitative metrics extracted from a large majority of research papers published between 2009 and 2024 on solid-state/quasi solid-state/hybrid LOBs (totaling 48, collected data set can be found in Supporting Information spreadsheet).16&#8211;41 In this work, current density and specific capacity are consistently compared using the units of mA/cm2 and mAh/cm2, respectively. We find that while solid-state LOBs have made progress in material selections and performances, they remain limited by low current densities, cycle capacities, and interfacial stability issues. Inconsistent reporting practices, particularly on liquid content, operational conditions, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS)/titration data, and loading information hinder accurate comparisons across studies. Addressing these challenges and standardizing reporting are essential steps toward realizing the commercial potential of solid-state lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries. Research Progress and Trends Cycle current density is a critical parameter for evaluating the rate capability and efficiency of solid-state LOBs. Figure 1a shows the reported cycle current densities over time, ranging from 2009 to 2024. The data indicates a diverse range of current densities explored in the range of 0.013&#8211;0.516 mA/cm2. A high proportion, 86.7%, of research works have primarily focused on low current densities, which are define as less than 0.3 mA/cm2. Only three studies reported current densities above 0.5 mA/cm2. However, the two of the studies used a specific amount of liquid electrolyte,25,30 while another study demonstrated its performance for only 10 cycles.17 In addition, there is no clear trend of increasing current densities over the years (Figure 1a), indicating that the cycle performance of solid-state LOBs is limited to low current densities. At higher current densities, the number of achievable cycles decreases significantly. Similarly, the reported cycle capacities are generally low, with 90.9% of reported values under 1 mAh/cm2 (Figure 1b). However, they were either incorporated with certain amounts of liquid electrolyte21,22,38 or operated at high temperatures.27 In fact, it appears that studies of recent years have clustered to an areal capacity range of 0.1&#8211;0.5 mAh/cm2, suggesting it has become a sort of standard practice to remain within these bounds for cycling. One of the possible reasons is that the electrochemical efficiencies of these cells are insufficient to support long-term cycling at high rates. It is known that Li2O2 titration and DEMS are effective approaches to examine the efficiency of OER and ORR. Unfortunately, our analysis indicates that Li2O2 titration and DEMS results are missing from many papers. This will be further discussed in a later section. Figure 1 | Research progress and trends. (a) Cycle current densities; (b) cycle capacity; (c) cycle number; and (d) throughput capacity over time, ranging from 2009 to 2024. Download figure Download PowerPoint Interestingly, we still observed a steady increase in cycle life over time for solid-state LOB (Figure 1c). Given the significant impact of the volume of liquid electrolyte on the performance of solid-state LOBs, it is important to point out that there are two clear groups of studies. Articles that incorporate high liquid (&gt;5 uL) and those that incorporate none to limited amounts (&gt;5 uL) of explicitly added electrolyte. When these two groups are separated (Figure 1c inset), the increasing trend in cycle life becomes arguably more pronounced. The magnitude of such trends proved to be deceiving. Unfortunately, upon a more detailed investigation, the upward trends in cycle life are very much amplified due to the decreasing trend in cycling capacity that used during long cycle tests. If we adopt a figure of metric for Li metal anodes, the throughput capacity,42,43 the cycling capacity is also taken into account by computing a total cycled capacity (areal capacity &#215; cycle number), and we can see that the grouping of the performance over the years becomes tighter with a significantly weaker upward trend. Specifically, solid-state LOBs could only operate for less than 132 cycles before 2019, while the cycle life of cells have been extensively improved in the recent years. Notably, the cycle life of a Li2O-based solid-state LOB44 and a cell with an integrated cathode/electrolyte structure45 has reached 1000 cycles. Both works focus on solving at least one of the essential challenges of solid-state LOBs. An LOB with Li2O as the main discharge product, produced through a four-electron process, can achieve significantly higher energy density compared to an LOB with Li2O2 as the main discharge product, which is formed through a two-electron process. More importantly, Li2O can be generated at a lower charge potential, reducing the formation of side products and minimizing SSE degradation, thereby extending cycle life. Meanwhile, the integrated cathode and electrolyte was proven to be an effective approach to mitigating the high interfacial impedance issue which has already been recognized as one of the main challenges for solid-state LOBs. The solid-state cells from these two works exhibited both long cycle life and high throughput capacity. Both cases encourage a strategic focus on addressing fundamental challenges in solid-state LOBs. By concentrating on these critical issues, researchers are making significant progress in improving the longevity and overall performance of solid-state LOBs, advancing them toward practical application. This analysis shows that the performance of solid-state LOBs has improved to some extent over the past decade. However, most studies are limited to low current densities and small specific capacities, indicating that current solid-state materials or solid-state LOB systems are not yet capable of supporting high areal capacity cycle testing effectively. Among these 48 research articles, there exists a large range of different materials with different performances. The types of SSE materials used from 2009 to 2024 are shown in Figure 2a. They were primarily categorized into five classes: polymer, lithium lanthanum titanium oxide (LLTO), lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO), lithium aluminium germanium phosphate (LAGP) or LATP, and composite types. Polymer refers to SSEs primarily composed of a polymer matrix and Li+ salt. LLTO, LLZO, and LAGP or LATP refer to SSEs where these materials constitute the majority composition, without polymers. The composite type includes SSEs made from Li+ salt, polymers, and additional materials such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, perovskite (LLTO), garnet (LLZO or LLZTO), or NASICON-type (LAGP or LATP) materials. It is clear that NASICON-type and polymer type are always common choices across the decades. LLZO and composite types have been extensively studied since 2017. After 2021, composite types have become the primary choice for SSE. This shift likely reflects researchers' efforts to address a wider range of challenges by incorporating diverse materials into SSEs, thereby enhancing overall performance factors such as mechanical stability, ionic conductivity, and interface impedance. Figure 2 | Materials for SSE. (a) Materials selection trend for SSE over time; (b) Cycle life; and (c) throughput capacity distribution for different SSE materials. Download figure Download PowerPoint The cycle life and throughput capacity distribution for different SSE materials are shown in Figure 2b,c. Composite type SSE show the widest range of cycle number and throughput capacities, suggesting that composites are relatively mature among the material studied, though high cycle life (&gt;200) remains rare. The LAGP/LATP group shows most studies distributed in the low cycle life (0&#8211;50 and 50&#8211;100) and low throughput capacity (0&#8211;10 and 10&#8211;25), indicating that these materials often experience early capacity fade, potentially due to instability of SSE materials and high interfacial impedance. Two studies report exceptionally high throughput capacities exceeding 200; however, their cells were immersed in a certain amount of ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) liquid electrolyte. The LLTO and LLZO types exhibit similar moderate cycle life and throughput capacity, though LLZO studies scatter across a wider range. Polymer-based solid-state LOBs show a relatively even distribution across all ranges, suggesting varied performance outcomes depending on other factors, such as specific polymer formulation and cell design. Though composite and polymer types show potential in terms of cycle life and throughput capacity, there is still significant room for improvement across all material types. In addition, the composite-type solid-state LOBs with an integrated SSE/cathode structure is a promising strategy to solve the interfacial impedance issue.46 This design minimizes the physical and chemical mismatches at the interface, leading to improved ionic conductivity and reduced resistance. Additionally, the integrated structure enhances mechanical stability, mitigates the formation of voids or cracks during cycling, and ensures better contact between active materials, ultimately improving cycle life and overall cell performance. Achieving high cycle life and throughput capacity in solid-state LOBs remains challenging, especially for LAGP/LATP, LLTO, and LLZO materials. This suggests that future research should prioritize enhancing the stability and compatibility of these materials. Additionally, optimizing the composition and structure of composites and polymers could further enhance their performance, positioning them as one of the leading candidates for the next generation of solid-state LOBs. The average throughput capacity, cycle number, and operating current density of each type of SSE materials are summarized in Supporting Information Figure S1. Polymer-based electrolytes exhibit the highest cycle numbers, suggesting superior stability during cycling. However, their throughput capacity is moderate, indicating potential limitations in achieving high capacity. LAGP/LATP and composite materials show relatively balanced performance, with moderate cycle numbers and decent throughput capacities. This balance may make them suitable for applications where both cycle number and capacity are critical. LLZO displays a lower throughput capacity but competitive cycle numbers, while LLTO demonstrates higher throughput capacity, indicating potential for high-rate applications. Reporting Practices Due to the rather nascent nature of the field of solid-state LOB, reporting practices are not as well established as adjacent battery fields. At times, there are crucial details that are missing from articles that can greatly sway the conclusion of the study. One such detail is the degree of liquid addition. An all-solid-state LOB is appealing due to its potential for achieving high energy density and excellent safety performance. However, the cycle performance of all-solid-state LOBs is severely limited by poor interfacial contact. To enhance the overall performance of solid-state LOBs, researchers have opted to incorporate liquid electrolytes during cell fabrication. Several methods are used to achieve this: (1) adding a "few" microliters of tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) to the SSE slurry during membrane fabrication; (2) soaking the SSE in a 1 M LiTFSI solution with TEGDME as the solvent; (3) adding a few microliters of 1 M LiTFSI with TEGDME to the cathode during cell assembly. The boiling point of TEGDME is as high as 275 &#176;C, which is hard to evaporate even under vacuum conditions. We summarized the percentage of SSEs incorporating liquid electrolyte across all 48 studies. Any study that explicitly described using one of the liquid incorporation methods mentioned above was considered a liquid inclusive study. As shown in Figure 3a, 35.4% of studies incorporated liquid electrolyte or solvent. In 64.6% of the studies, there was no claim of the direct use of liquid electrolyte. However, it is also noted that common polymer solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and dimethylformamide (DMF), cannot be fully removed by vacuum drying at typical temperatures of 50&#8211;80 &#176;C, as used in many studies.7 These solvent molecules can also interact with Li+ salt molecules, making complete removal unlikely. Therefore, 64.6% of studies cannot be conclusively classified as fully solid-state LOBs, as residual liquid may remain in the SSEs. Based on these criteria, we have identified eight studies that likely describe 100% all-solid-state electrolytes with negligible liquid content, as noted in Supporting Information Table S1. These electrolytes are predominantly LAGP- or LLZO-based and are fabricated using methods such as cold pressing, hot pressing, or sintering. Figure 3 | Reporting practices. (a) Percentage of studies incorporating liquid in solid-state LOBs. (b) Distribution of operation temperature for solid-state LOBs. (c) Availability of DEMS results across 48 papers. (d) Number of loading information reported across 48 papers. Download figure Download PowerPoint Though performance improved, the involvement of liquid electrolyte or solvent would introduce additional challenges: (1) Liquid solvents, such as TEGDME, can still decompose into byproducts, as observed liquid-state LOB cells, leading to increased overpotential and reduced cycle life; (2) the performance improvements brought by liquid residue may diminish over time due to the gradual evaporation of the liquid, such as NMP and DMF; and (3) some solvents, such as dimethylsulfoxide, are known to be reactive with intermediates in the LOB reactions.47 Adding liquid without careful design solely for performance improvement risks being a shortsighted solution without addressing the fundamental issues of solid-state LOBs. The percentage of operation temperature of solid-state LOBs is also summarized in Figure 3b. Of the works, 83.7% focus their studies on room temperature (25 &#176;C). It is known that elevated temperature can improve ion conductivity of SSE, resulting in an improvement of battery performance. Several studies operated their cells at higher temperatures because they used pure LLZO or LAGP to fabricate the SSE, which may imply insufficient conductivity (especially at the interfaces) at room temperature. In general, room temperature solid-state LOBs are more practical, but high temperature solid-state LOBs are also valuable for certain extreme operating conditions. Li2O2 titration and DEMS results are important indicators of ORR and OER efficiency. Li2O2 can be quantified by Ti(IV)OSO4 solution though UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy technique or by potassium iodide under acidic conditions, the resulting elemental iodine (I2) can be titrated using sodium thiosulfate solution (Na2S2O3).48,49 DEMS can quantify gas evolution and evaluate electron transfer number of OER process. However, most studies lack titration results, and only 12.5% of them include DEMS data (Figure 3c). It is understandable that the discharge products of LOBs are influenced by various factors, such as SSE materials, liquid fraction, and cathode composition. Additionally, some studies may not focus on the discharge products of the first cycle. However, high-performance solid-state LOBs typically begin with a promising initial result, making it important to include this fundamental information at the early stages of research. Some solid-state LOB systems can even discharge without oxygen or charge in the absence of Li2O2 because the complex battery system includes multiple materials, some of which may decompose during operation. Without basic characterizations, such as discharge product confirmation and DEMS analysis, it is challenging to confirm whether the cell operates via a true oxygen redox electrochemical process or majorly through irreversible side reaction. Future research should prioritize using titration to determine the Li2O2 yield rate during the ORR process and DEMS to measure O2 evolution during the OER process. Combining these results will enable accurate calculations of the true efficiency of solid-state LOBs. Additionally, conducting these tests at various cycle numbers of cycled cells can provide deeper insights into performance degradation and reaction mechanisms over time. Although irreversible, since the cycling areal capacity is controlled to be small, the large mass of cell component can sustain cycling that appears to be reversible. In fact, the mass of many of the cell components remains to be under reported. To estimate energy density of a solid-state LOB, some basic loading information is needed, including mass loading of anode, SSE, cathode, and catalysts/carbon loading on the cathode. The number of loading information reported across the 48 papers is summarized in Figure 3d. Unfortunately, only a meager 4 out of the 48 studies have all information available to calculate energy density at the chemistry level (mass of anode, electrolyte, cathode). Taking the weight of the above battery components without case into account, their energy densities are 33.47, 542.1, and 727.84 Wh/kg.16,30,45 We can observe a trend of improvement in the energy density of solid-state LOBs, increasing from 33.47 Wh/kg in 2009 to 727.84 Wh/kg in 2018, although it still falls short of practical levels.50 More importantly, with 91.7% of studies lacking the necessary loading information to calculate cell energy density, it is difficult to claim whether advancements in energy densities have been made. This indicates that most research groups are not yet focused on achieving high energy density and are likely still studying the fundamental mechanism of the system. To have a better comparison among different studies in the future, it is recommended that all studies report specific loading information of each battery components, especially the unit of performance matrix is mA/g or mAh/g. It is also important to specify liquid addition and operation temperature information. Relationship Among Different Performance Metrics Although energy density cannot be calculated for many of the 48 papers, we can still draw some conclusions about the performance of solid-state LOB. Specifically, the correlations among current densities, throughput capacity, and cycle number are further examined to investigate the research stage of solid-state LOBs. In general, cells cycling at low current densities are expected to achieve a higher cycle number and larger throughput capacity as the Li metal anode is known to behave better at low current densities while the air cathode is known to experience side reaction-inducing overpotential. This appears to be somewhat true when looking at the cycle life versus current density plot shown in Figure 4a. Solid-state LOBs cycled at low current densities tend to have longer cycle numbers. However, when the throughput capacity is used, we see that lower current density does not significantly imply high throughput capacity (Figure 4b). In fact, there is little trend between the throughput capacity versus current density. If the throughput capacity is taken as a more significant metric than cycle number for quantifying performance, this suggests that the current density regime that is commonly operated are not influential to the performance. Other factors beyond current densities, such as interfacial impedance, stability of SSE, ionic conductivity, and compatibility and reactivity with lithium metal, play a more crucial role in determining the performance of solid-state LOBs. Figure 4 | Apparent relationship between different parameters. The correlation between (a) cycle number and current density; (b) throughput capacity and current density; and (c, d) throughput capacity and cycle number with unlimited liquid and limited liquid. Download figure Download PowerPoint The rate capability can depend on the ionic conductivity of SSE, interfacial impedance, and material stability. Ionic conductivity of SSE is not the primary limitation in rate capability of solid-state LOB performance. For example, a typical SSE with an ionic conductivity of 10&#8722;4 S/cm, a voltage drop of 0.2 V, and a thickness of around 200 &#956;m can theoretically support a current density of up to 1 mA/cm2, which is already higher than what is reported in most studies. Additionally, even at low rates, high energy density is achievable just as the process is simply slower. Similarly, if the voltage drop across the interface is 0.1 V and interfacial impedance increases from 200 to 500 ohms after long-term cycling, the maximum achievable current density will decrease 0.5&#8211;0.2 mA/cm2, reducing the cell rate performance. Such estimation proves the importance of interfacial impedance issues in a solid-state cell. It is also worth noting that the degradation of the SSE and cathode materials due to high current densities can further reduce performance, emphasizing the importance of stability studies. When the cases with unlimited and limited liquid electrolyte are analyzed separately, reasonably strong correlations (R2 = 0.77 or 0.76) are found between throughput capacity and cycle number (Figure 4c,d). This suggests that solid-state LOBs with longer cycle life also tend to have higher throughput capacity. Cells with high long-term stability are more likely to deliver better performance. Based on this, it is important to include more stability related studies, such as analysis of failure mechanisms and degradation of SSE, in research studies. However, most works have not yet incorporated or explored this information in depth. Meanwhile, most studies continue to focus on low cycle life and throughput capacity, indicating that current research on solid-state LOBs remains in the early stages. Conclusion In summary, solid-state Li-O2 batteries hold significant promise for high-energy-density energy storage solutions, suitable for advanced applications such as EVs, aviation, and portable electronics. Despite recent progress in material selection and performance optimization, these batteries still face critical challenges, including low current density, limited cycle capacity, and persistent issues with interfacial impedance and stability. Our analysis suggests that reporting practices, particularly regarding liquid content and operational conditions, are essential to enhance consistency and comparability across studies. Availability of DEMS and titration are important results to ensure that batteries are operating through a true oxygen redox electrochemical process. The loading amount is also essential to calculate and compare energy density of cells across all other solid-state LOB studies and battery chemistries. The relationships among different performance matrixes reveal that current research on solid-state LOBs remains in its infancy. To achieve practic</description>

      <title>Locoregional Anesthesia Due to Tumescence in Bilateral Total Mastectomy of Goats</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.22456/1679-9216.124154</link>
      <description>Gisele Pereira Guimaraes, Kelly Regina Freitas Freire, B Blanc, Egle Raoni de Brito Montenegro, Bruno Ferreira Sp&#237;ndola, Michel Abdalla Helayel, Saulo Andrade Caldas, ACTA SCIENTIAE VETERINARIAE. 50(None)] 2022. https://openalex.org/W4405719926

                Background: Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland or udder, regardless of its origin, severity, or evolution. Bilateral total mastectomy is indicated in cases of chronic suppurative mastitis, gangrenous mastitis, udder neoplasm or hyperplasia. For mastectomy, the supine position is recommended and, as it is a long-term procedure, general anesthesia was chosen together with the tumescence technique with the objective of transanesthetic and postoperative analgesia. The present report aims to report the general anesthesia protocol used for 2 goats submitted to bilateral total mastectomy associated with a locoregional block by tumescence, a technique not described in the goat species. Cases: Two female goats, mixed breed, approximately 3 years old, were admitted to the Hospital Veterin&#225;rio de Grandes Animais (HVGA) of the Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ), with a history of recurrent mastitis. There was an increase in udder volume and the presence of purulent secretion during milking. One of the animals had given birth about 20 days ago. Surgical treatment through bilateral total mastectomy was recommended for both animals, as they did not present a satisfactory response to antimicrobial therapy, excessive enlargement and functional loss of the mammary system. For the procedure, food fasting for 48 h and water fasting for 24 h was established. The anesthetic protocols used consisted of previous sedation with xylazine&#185; [Xilazin&#174; - 0.05 mg/kg, IM] anesthetic induction with ketamine&#178; [Ketalex&#174; - 10 mg/kg, IV] and midazolam&#179; [Dormire&#174; - 0.1 mg/kg, IV]. Orotracheal intubation and connection to the anesthetic circuit were performed for maintenance through inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane4 (Forane&#174;) and oxygen therapy. Then, in bottle of lactated ringer's solution5 [Linhamax&#174; - 500 mL], lidocaine 2%6 without vasoconstrictor [Lidovet&#174; - 40 mL] and adrenaline7 [Adren&#174; - 25 mg/mL, 0.5 mL] were added, 10 mL/kg of the solution were injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the region of the mammary chains utilizing a Klein cannula after local antisepsis. After the administration of the tumescent solution, it was observed that the area involved is presented with the formation of a gel and there is minimal bleeding, compared to the conventional technique. The animals were monitored for the degree of analgesia, recording vital signs every 15 min at the end of the surgery, dipyrone9 [D-500&#174; - 25 mg/kg, IV], morphine7 [Sulfato de Morfina&#174; - 0.1 mg/kg, SC], and meloxicam10 [Maxican&#174; 0.5 mg/kg, IM, 3 consecutive days] for postoperative analgesia. Additionally, tetanus serum1 [Vencosat&#174; - 50,000 IU, single dose] and of oxytetracycline&#185; [Oxitetraciclina LA&#174; - 10 mg/kg, IM, 5 applications on alternate days)]. In the following 24 h, no signs of pain were observed on palpation of the surgical wound in the animals, but goat 1 was apathetic and inappetent, with improvement in the clinical picture only 48 h after surgery. Discussion: The choice of the surgical procedure resulted in an improvement in the clinical conditions of the animals and the anesthetic protocol using inhalation anesthesia and locoregional block (tumescence) proved to be efficient to perform in goats, contributing to transanesthetic and postoperative analgesia, being easily applied to ruminants that need surgical interventions in the region of mammary chains. Keywords: ruminant, mastectomy, local anesthetic, locoregional block.</description>

      <description>Pawe&#322; J. Kulesza, Iwona A. Rutkowska, Anna Chmielnicka, Beata Rytelewska, Meeting abstracts/Meeting abstracts (Electrochemical Society. CD-ROM). MA2024-02(62)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405639657

                Our research interests aim at establishing structure/property relations leading to rational designs of functionalized materials for efficient electrocatalysis and electrochemical energy conversion and storage. There has been growing interest in the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide, a potent greenhouse gas and a contributor to global climate change. Given the fact that the CO 2 molecule is very stable, its electroreduction processes are characterized by large overpotentials. To optimize the hydrogenation-type electrocatalytic approach, we have proposed to utilize nanostructured metallic centers (e.g. Pd, Pt or Ru) in a form of highly dispersed and reactive nanoparticles generated within supramolecular network of distinct nitrogen, sulfur or oxygen-coordination complexes. Among important issues are the mutual completion between hydrogen evolution and carbon dioxide reduction and specific interactions between coordinating centers and metallic sites. We have also explored the ability of biofilms to form hydro-gel-type aggregates of microorganisms attached to various surfaces including those of carbon electrode materials. Upon incorporation of various noble metal nanostructures and/or conducting polymer ultra-thin films, highly reactive and selective systems toward CO 2 -reduction have been obtained. Another possibility to enhance electroreduction of carbon dioxide is to explore direct transformation of solar energy to chemical energy using transition metal oxide semiconductor materials. We show here that, by intentional and controlled combination of metal oxide semiconductors (titanium (IV) oxide and copper (I) oxide), we have been able to drive effectively photoelectrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide mostly to methanol. Application of metal oxides as active matrices in electrocatalysis is particular importance. The hydrous behavior, which favors proton mobility and affects overall reactivity, reflects not only the oxide&#8217;s chemical properties but its texture and morphology as well. For example, the mixed WO 3 /ZrO 2 systems are characterized by fast charge (electron, proton) propagation during the system&#8217;s redox transitions. By dispersing metallic Cu electrocatalytic nanoparticles over such active WO 3 /ZrO 2 supports, the electrocatalytic activities of the respective systems toward the reduction of carbon dioxide have been enhanced even at decreased loadings in acid media. The fact that WO 3 /ZrO 2 nanostructures are in immediate contact with the metallic catalytic sites leads to the specific interactions (via the surface hydroxyl groups) with the reaction intermediates (e.g. CO adsorbates). Formation of ammonia is one of the most important chemical synthetic processes. Under industrial conditions, ammonia is primarily been synthesized from nitrogen and hydrogen via the Haber-Bosch process which requires pressurizing and heating, despite utilization of catalysts. Consequently, development of low-temperature synthetic methodology is tempting both from the practical and fundamental reasons. An ultimate goal for electrochemistry is to generate NH 3 from N 2 at temperatures lower than 100&#186;C, atmospheric pressure, and with use of new generation of catalysts. Currently, most of electrochemical approaches to drive N 2 -fixation suffer from slow kinetics due to the difficulty of achieving the appropriate adsorption and activation of dinitrogen molecule leading to cleavage of the strong triple N&#8801;N bond. Our recent studies, clearly demonstrate that coordinatively stabilized iron catalytic sites, e.g. iron-centered heme-type porphyrins or iron phosphide, FeP and Fe 2 P phases, have been found to act as efficient catalysts for the formation of NH 3 in alkaline and semi-neutral media.</description>

Geographical distribution of authors for the articles in the Applied Materials Portfolio Journals' Early Career Forum.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideThis Forum highlights groundbreaking research and innovative ideas from the emerging authors in the scientific community. A broad range of topics are covered, among these, energy and biorelated research take center stage, with a significant number of papers dedicated to these fields. Given the diversity of the topics, it is challenging to single out individual contributions. Instead, I have approached this by analyzing the prevailing trends across the Forum.Energy research is undergoing a transformative phase, fueled by advancements in catalysts, photocatalysts, batteries materials, and fabrication techniques. These breakthroughs are driving innovations in energy storage, harvesting, and conversion technologies, offering sustainable and efficient solutions for the future. Multifunction catalysts and photocatalysts materials are unlocking new potential in applications such as zinc&#8211;air batteries, hydrogen production, and water splitting. (1&#8722;4)Progress in advanced photovoltaic materials, including perovskites and photonic nanomaterials, is accelerating renewable energy technologies. Thermoelectric materials enable the conversion of low-grade heat into usable energy, whereas lightweight, flexible materials, such as 2D structures and thin-film polymers, are paving the way for scalable solar films and stretchable thermoelectric generators. (5&#8722;7)In biomaterials, different types of nanoparticles are revolutionizing cancer therapy, imaging, and biosensor technologies. Stimuli-responsive materials are employed for targeted drug delivery and advanced medical applications. Meanwhile, bioinks and 3D-printed biomaterials are driving breakthroughs in tissue engineering and wound healing, combining biocompatibility with functional properties to support regenerative medicine. (8&#8722;12)I would like to highlight a few noteworthy articles in key themes such as energy, catalysis, and device technologies. In a perspective, Xin et al. discuss nonconventional electrochemical reactions in rechargeable lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, addressing the challenge of unstable polysulfide intermediates. The authors review innovative strategies to enhance battery stability and performance, focusing on modifications to sulfur allotropes, electrolyte composition, and electrode design. (13) In a related study, Shi et al. investigate the nucleation mechanisms of lithium pits and their morphological evolution across large electrode areas. Their findings reveal that overpotential is inversely related to pit radius and exponentially related to nucleation rate, offering new insights for predicting and controlling surface area and roughness in lithium electrodes under various stripping conditions (Figure 2). (14)Figure 2Figure 2. Selected graphics from ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces Early Career Forum, showcasing energy-related research, including studies on lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries and lithium pit nucleation.High Resolution ImageDownload MS PowerPoint SlideIn the rapidly growing area of electronics, two particularly exciting fields&#9472;optoelectronic synapses and heat harvesting&#9472;are showcased. Xu and co-workers present an organic optoelectronic synapse with multilevel memory, enabled by gate modulation. It mimics synaptic plasticity with both volatile and nonvolatile states, transitioning between short-term and long-term plasticity through gate voltage and light exposure. The device offers program/erase current ratios and stability, making it a promising candidate for neuromorphic systems in image processing and memory retention (Figure 3A). (15) In parallel, Cai et al. introduce a heat harvesting system that combines daytime radiative cooling with thermally regenerative electrochemical cycles (TREC). Using nanoporous polyethylene and MXene, the system passively generates a 35 &#176;C temperature difference under sunlight, converting ambient heat into continuous electricity with a 50 mV cell voltage and over 20 mAh/g specific capacity, without external charging (Figure 3B). (16)Figure 3Figure 3. Selected graphics from ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces Early Career Forum.
