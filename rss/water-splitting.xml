      <title>Oxygen Vacancy and Heterostructure Modulation of Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P/Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P Electrocatalysts for Improving Total Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.3c19548</link>

                Designing a stable and highly active catalyst for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) is essential for the industrialization of hydrogen energy but remains a major challenge. This work reports a simple approach to fabricating coupled Co2P/Fe2P nanorod array catalyst for overall water decomposition, demonstrating the source of excellent activity in the catalytic process. Under alkaline conditions, Co2P/Fe2P heterostructures exhibit an overpotential of 96 and 220 mV for HER and OER, respectively, at 10 mA cm&#8211;2. For total water splitting, a low voltage of 1.56 V is required to provide a current density of 10 mA cm&#8211;2. And the catalyst exhibits long-term durability for 30 h at a high current density of 250 mA cm&#8211;2. The analysis of the results revealed that the presence of interfacial oxygen vacancies and the strong interaction between Co2P/Fe2P provided the catalyst with more electrochemically active sites and a faster charge transfer capability, which improved the hydrolysis dissociation process. Electrochemically active metal (oxygen) hydroxide phases were produced after OER stability testing. The results of this study prove its great potential in practical industrial electrolysis and provide a reasonable and feasible strategy for the design of nonprecious metal phosphide electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Bifunctional ligand Co metal-organic framework derived heterostructured Co-based nanocomposites as oxygen electrocatalysts toward rechargeable zinc-air batteries</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.03.040</link>
      <description>Xinglong Xie, Zeyu Zhai, Wenwu Cao, Jian Dong, Yushan Li, Qiangchuan Hou, Guixiang Du, Jiajun Wang, Li Tian, Jingbo Zhang, Tierui Zhang, Lu Shang, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392563475

                Rational construction of efficient and robust bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is key but challenging for the widespread application of rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). Herein, bifunctional ligand Co metal&#8211;organic frameworks were first explored to fabricate a hybrid of heterostructured CoOx/Co nanoparticles anchored on a carbon substrate rich in CoNx sites (CoOx/Co@CoNC) via a one-step pyrolysis method. Such a unique heterostructure provides abundant CoNx and CoOx/Co active sites to drive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER), respectively. Besides, their positive synergies facilitate electron transfer and optimize charge/mass transportation. Consequently, the obtained CoOx/Co@CoNC exhibits a superior ORR activity with a higher half-wave potential of 0.88 V than Pt/C (0.83 V vs. RHE), and a comparable OER performance with an overpotential of 346 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 to the commercial RuO2. The assembled ZAB using CoOx/Co@CoNC as a cathode catalyst displays a maximum power density of 168.4 mW cm&#8722;2, and excellent charge&#8211;discharge cyclability over 250 h at 5 mA cm&#8722;2. This work highlights the great potential of heterostructures in oxygen electrocatalysis and provides a new pathway for designing efficient bifunctional oxygen catalysts toward rechargeable ZABs.</description>

                Abstract Efficient electrocatalysts are pivotal for advancing green energy conversion technologies. Organic electrocatalysts, as cost&#8208;effective alternatives to noble&#8208;metal benchmarks, have garnered attention. However, the understanding of the relationships between their properties and electrocatalytic activities remains ambiguous. Plenty of research articles regarding low&#8208;cost organic electrocatalysts started to gain momentum in 2010 and have been flourishing recently though, a review article for both entry&#8208;level and experienced researchers in this field is still lacking. This review underscores the urgent need to elucidate the structure&#8208;activity relationship and design suitable electrode structures, leveraging the unique features of organic electrocatalysts like controllability and compatibility for real&#8208;world applications. Organic electrocatalysts are classified into four groups: small molecules, oligomers, polymers, and frameworks, with specific structural and physicochemical properties serving as activity indicators. To unlock the full potential of organic electrocatalysts, five strategies are discussed: integrated structures, surface property modulation, membrane technologies, electrolyte affinity regulation, and addition of anti&#8208;corrosion species, all aimed at enhancing charge efficiency, mass transfer, and long&#8208;term stability during electrocatalytic reactions. The review offers a comprehensive overview of the current state of organic electrocatalysts and their practical applications, bridging the understanding gap and paving the way for future developments of more efficient green energy conversion technologies.

      <title>Mesoporous Single Atom-Cluster Fe&#8211;N/C Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts Synthesized with Bottlebrush Block Copolymer-Templated Rapid Thermal Annealing</title>

                Current electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are either expensive (such as IrO2, RuO2) or/and exhibit high overpotential as well as sluggish kinetics. This article reports mesoporous earth-abundant iron (Fe)&#8211;nitrogen (N) doped carbon electrocatalysts with iron clusters and closely surrounding Fe&#8211;N4 active sites. Unique to this work is that the mechanically stable mesoporous carbon-matrix structure (79 nm in pore size) with well-dispersed nitrogen-coordinated Fe single atom-cluster is synthesized via rapid thermal annealing (RTA) within only minutes using a self-assembled bottlebrush block copolymer (BBCP) melamine&#8211;formaldehyde resin composite template. The resulting porous structure and domain size can be tuned with the degree of polymerization of the BBCP backbone, which increases the electrochemically active surface area and improves electron transfer and mass transport for an effective OER process. The optimized electrocatalyst shows a required potential of 1.48 V (versus RHE) to obtain the current density of 10 mA/cm2 in 1 M KOH aqueous electrolyte and a small Tafel slope of 55 mV/decade at a given overpotential of 250 mV, which is significantly lower than recently reported earth-abundant electrocatalysts. Importantly, the Fe single-atom nitrogen coordination environment facilitates the surface reconstruction into a highly active oxyhydroxide under OER conditions, as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ Raman spectroscopy, while the atomic clusters boost the single atoms reactive sites to prevent demetalation during the OER process. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support that the iron nitrogen environment and reconstructed oxyhydroxides are electrocatalytically active sites as the kinetics barrier is largely reduced. This work has opened a new avenue for simple, rapid synthesis of inexpensive, earth-abundant, tailorable, mechanically stable, mesoporous carbon-coordinated single-atom electrocatalysts that can be used for renewable energy production.</description>

      <title>Direct Synthesis of CuP2 and Cu3P and Their Performance as Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen Evolution, Oxygen Evolution, and Oxygen Reduction Reactions</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.3390/solids5010010</link>
      <description>Xiao Ma, Xueni Huang, Abdessadek Lachgar, Solids. 5(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392587799

                Copper phosphides are promising materials for energy conversion applications because of their unique electronic structure and controllable composition. Two stoichiometric copper phosphides, CuP2 and Cu3P, were prepared by direct wet-chemical synthesis using red phosphorus. They were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The precursor selection, reaction temperature, time and solvent composition were also studied. CuP2 is the thermodynamically more stable product, but Cu3P is more commonly obtained. This work demonstrated that higher temperature helps in CuP2 formation. More importantly, using more trioctylphosphine oxide helps control the morphology leading to crystal growth along the crystallographic a-axis. CuP2 and Cu3P were tested for hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, and oxygen reduction reactions. CuP2 works better for HER in acidic conditions and OER in general, and Cu3P showed better activity than CuP2 for HER and ORR in an alkaline medium. This study has led to a simple approach to the synthesis of CuP2 nanowires.</description>

      <title>Strong Lewis acid-induced self-healing of loose FeOOH for alkaline oxygen evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.150253</link>
      <description>Ning Yu, Jing Lv, Zhanhu Guo, Xin-Jie Tian, Yusheng Zhang, Wenjing Li, Yulu Zhou, Yong&#8208;Ming Chai, Bin Dong, Chemical Engineering Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392593905

                The fast leaching of the Fe catalytic center and low conductivity of FeOOH have hindered the optimal stability and activity of Fe-based electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reactions (OER). Here, Zn2+ is introduced into FeOOH with a looser nanosheet structure by regulating electric double layer (EDL) repulsion during electrodeposition. Meanwhile, as strong Lewis acids, Zn2+ in ZnxFeOOH could act as an electron acceptor, accepting electrons from FeOOH. The doping of Zn2+ shortens the bond length of Fe-O and enhances the covalency of Fe-O to improve electron transport rate and stability. The faster catalytic kinetics also been obtained by facilitating O* to form OOH* intermediates. At 100 mA cm&#8722;2, Zn0.5FeOOH requires overpotential of only 250 mV and maintains initial activity in 1 M KOH after 120 h. Notably, Zn-induced self-healing is achieved when the leaching and redeposition of Fe reach dynamic equilibrium. In 1 M KOH seawater, Zn0.5FeOOH requires overpotentials of 286 mV to produce current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2. At 2.0 V, Zn0.5FeOOH can achieve 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 in anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolyzer at room temperature. This work provides an effective Zn-induced strategy for designing efficient and stable OER catalysts for industrial development.</description>

                Abstract Electrocatalyst degradation, often caused by oxidative processes, forms a large barrier for the wide-spread application of electrolysers and fuel cells, which are crucial for a sustainable energy society. A detailed understanding of the catalyst surface structure under oxygen evolution reaction (OER) conditions is, therefore, required to design more stable catalysts. Here, we study the oxidation of a Pt(111) model electrode under operando conditions combining High-Energy Surface X-ray Diffraction (HE-SXRD) with a Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) in a unique experimental setup. This novel approach allows us to follow the atomic structure of the electrode/electrolyte interface under oxygen evolution reaction conditions under hitherto unexplored potential regimes. We find that the Pt(111) surface gets electro-oxidized in a layer-by-layer fashion, which is the best scenario in terms of electrode stability. From ex situ X-ray Reflectivity (XRR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements we find that a sub-nm thick, PtO 2 oxide film is forming, which deactivates the surface and leads to surface roughening after subsequent dissolution. Our results provide important insight for the operation of fuel cells and electrolysers under intermittent conditions of renewable energies.</description>

      <title>Augmenting the Electrocatalytic Activities of Metal&#8211;N-Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes as Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution Reactions by Carbon Composite Strategy</title>

                The pursuit of efficient transformation of green energy sources through water electrolysis necessitates the expansion of reasonable, earth-abundant, and robust bifunctional electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In this connection, N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) coordinated metal complexes have become one of the most stimulating and ubiquitous classes of organometallics due to their ease of preparation and modularity in stereoelectronic possessions. Here, we report a series of metal NHC complexes synthesized by the reaction of an NHC precursor with an appropriate metal source and thoroughly characterized using spectral and analytical techniques. Both metal&#8211;NHC complexes and their carbon composites using multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and graphene plates (GP) were tested for their electrochemical HER and OER performances in acidic and basic electrolytes, respectively. The MWCNT and GP composites displayed improved HER activity compared with the bare complexes. Furthermore, a two-fold improved OER performance of the carbon composites was evident compared with the activity of the bare metal&#8211;NHC complexes to achieve the overpotential (&#951;10). Furthermore, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic technique was used to bring out the key information required to justify the activity trend in HER and OER reactions and the nature of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interaction of electrocatalysts.</description>

                Developing a highly efficient catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance for its application in electrocatalytic water splitting. Herein, a solid&#8211;solid transformation strategy has been developed to construct sulfur-doped Ni0.5Co0.5Fe2O4 spinel porous single-crystal nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (S-NCFO/NF). The single-crystalline nanosheet self-assembled nanostructures can provide fast charge transfer channels. With the effect of S-doping, a distorted/incomplete octahedral structure nanosheet can be formed. The unique porous S-NCFO nanosheets can provide a large number of active sites and sufficiently contact the electrolyte to adsorb OH&#8211; and desorb O2. By virtue of the porous single-crystal nanosheet, sulfur-doped spinel structure, and the unique self-assembled nanosheet configurations, the S-NCFO/NF electrode exhibits enhanced OER performance with low overpotentials at 100 mA cm&#8211;2 of 300 mV in 1 M KOH and 317 mV in 1 M KOH + 0.5 M NaCl. The synthesis strategy provides insight for the preparation and application of self-assembled nanostructures in electrocatalytic seawater splitting.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline water electrolysis by Lorentz forces generated by an external magnetic field</title>

                The effects of vertical Lorentz forces generated by an external magnetic field applied perpendicular to the inherent electric field on the oxygen evolution reaction conducted on a Ni wire are investigated using cyclic voltammetry, impedance measurements, and particle image velocimetry (PIV). Both downward and upward Lorentz forces provide smaller overpotentials than that generated in their absence. Based on a dual-bubble layer model for reactant transfer, we find that the diffusion resistance of the hydroxide ions and increased ohmic resistance (after iR correction) induced by the layer of bubbles attached to the electrode surface are most effectively alleviated by the downward Lorentz force, while the charge-transfer resistance is retained. Furthermore, the generated bubbles have smaller average diameters. By using PIV measurements, we find that stronger shear stresses induced by the faster flow of the electrolyte in the vicinity of the working electrode facilitate the detachment of bubbles from the electrode surface.</description>

      <title>Assessment of photosynthetic activity in dense microalgae cultures using oxygen production</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2024.108510</link>

                Microalgae are photosynthetic microorganisms playing a pivotal role in primary production in aquatic ecosystems, sustaining the entry of carbon in the biosphere. Microalgae have also been recognized as sustainable source of biomass to complement crops. For this objective they are cultivated in photobioreactors or ponds at high cell density to maximize biomass productivity and lower the cost of downstream processes. Photosynthesis depends on light availability, that is often not constant over time. In nature, sunlight fluctuates over diurnal cycles and weather conditions. In high-density microalgae cultures of photobioreactors outdoors, on top of natural variations, microalgae are subjected to further complexity in light exposure. Because of the high-density cells experience self-shading effects that heavily limit light availability in most of the mass culture volume. This limitation strongly affects biomass productivity of industrial microalgae cultivation plants with important implication on economic feasibility. Understanding how photosynthesis responds to cell density is informative to assess functionality in the inhomogeneous light environment of industrial photobioreactors. In this work we exploited a high-sensitivity Clark electrode to measure microalgae photosynthesis and compare cultures with different densities, using Nannochloropsis as model organism. We observed that cell density has a substantial impact on photosynthetic activity, and demonstrated the reduction of the cell's light-absorption capacity by genetic modification is a valuable strategy to increase photosynthetic functionality on a chlorophyll-basis of dense microalgae cultures.</description>

      <title>Construction of porous flower-like Ru-doped CoNiFe layered double hydroxide for supercapacitors and oxygen evolution reaction catalysts</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.03.044</link>
      <description>Qian Ding, Jingbo Yin, Yueyue Huang, Chaofan Wang, Hubin Luo, Shiguo Sun, Yongqian Xu, Hongjuan Li, Journal of Colloid and Interface Science. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392626543

                In recent years, ternary layered double hydroxide (LDH) has become a research hotspot for electrode materials and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyst due to the enhanced synergistic effect between individual elements. However, the application of LDH is greatly limited by its low electrical conductivity and the disadvantage that nanosheets tend to accumulate and mask the active sites. Herein, a novel Ru-doped CoNiFe &#8722; LDH was prepared via a facile hydrothermal method. According to the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the doping of Ru element could improve electron state density and band gaps of LDH and consequently boosted the electrochemical reaction kinetics as well as electrical conductivity. Furthermore, introduction of Ru atom induced the formation of porous flower-like structures in nanosheets. Compared to CoNiFe &#8722; LDH (28.9 m2/g), Ru-doped CoNiFe &#8722; LDH performed larger specific surface area of 53.1 m2/g, resulting in more electrochemically active sites. In these case, Ru-doped CoNiFe &#8722; LDH demonstrated better energy storage performance of 176.0 mAh/g at 1 A/g compared to original CoNiFe &#8722; LDH (78.9 mAh/g at 1 A/g). Besides, the assembled Ru-doped CoNiFe &#8722; LDH//activated carbon (AC) device delivered a maximum energy density of 36.4 W h kg&#8722;1 at the power density of 740.3 W kg&#8722;1 and an outstanding cycle life (78.7 % after 10,000 cycles). Meanwhile, Ru-doped CoNiFe &#8722; LDH exhibited lower overpotential (339 mV at 50 mA cm&#8722;2) and Tafel slope (93.2 mV dec&#8722;1). Therefore, this work provided novel and valuable insights into the rational doping of Ru elements for the controlled synthesis of supercapacitor electrode materials and OER catalysts.</description>

      <title>Perovskite for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution at Elevated Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202301534</link>
      <description>Fatma Abdelghafar, Xiaomin Xu, San Ping Jiang, Zongping Shao, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4392697241

                The development of advanced electrolysis technologies such as anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) is central to the vision of a sustainable energy future. Key to the realization of such AEMWE technology lies in the exploration of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;efficient catalysts for facilitating the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Despite tremendous efforts in the fundamental research, most of today&#8217;s OER works are conducted under room temperature, which deviates significantly with AEMWE&#8217;s operating temperature (50&#8211;80 &#176;C). To bridge this gap, it is highly desirable to obtain insights into the OER catalytic behavior at elevated temperatures. Herein, using the well&#8208;known perovskite catalyst Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3&#8722;&#948; (BSCF) as a proof of concept, the effect of temperature on the variation in OER catalytic activity and stability is evaluated. It is found that the BSCF&#8217;s activity increases with increasing temperature due to enhanced lattice oxygen participation promoting the lattice oxygen&#8208;mediated OER process. Further, surface amorphization and cation leaching of BSCF become more pronounced as temperature increases, causing a somewhat attenuated OER stability. These new understandings of the fundamental OER catalysis over perovskite materials at industrial&#8208;relevant temperature conditions are expected to have strong implications for the research of OER catalysts to be deployed in practical water electrolyzers.</description>

                Nitrogen doped leather waste-derived carbon materials have been employed as eletrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction. Low current densities and complex synthesis routes of other carbon-based materials limit their practical applicability. We present herein a simple and cost-competitive design of a metal free nitrogen-doped carbon matrix (NCM). At 10 mA cm&#8722;2 of current density, the assembled NCM showed a low over potential of 330 mV. NCM provided 73 mV dec-1 of slope value according to Tafel analysis, with NCM slope value improved as compared to previously described electrocatalysts inclusive of graphene (113 mV dec&#8722;1) and carbon nanosheets (101 mV dec&#8722;1), under similar reaction conditions. Linear sweep voltamogram, stability test and electrochemical impedance spectra confirmed the potential of NCM in OER as a heterogeneous electrocatalyst.</description>

                Recently, surface reconstruction derived from Ir-based derivatives could achieve satisfactory oxygen evolution performance. Herein, ultra-long nanowire hollandite structured Rb0.17IrO2 was synthesized and a nano-amorphous layer with a thickness of &#8764;1.5 nm was achieved by interfacial oxidation treatment. The prepared catalyst exhibits outstanding water oxidation activity with an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 at 330 mV for robust continuous operation in acidic media. Through the spectroscopic and density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that the nano-amorphous layers induced by interfacial oxidation on the one-dimensional (1D)-nanowire surface have enhanced O-2p centers and increased Ir-O hybridization compared to the bulk Rb0.17IrO2 phase, which essentially balances the adsorption energy of the intermediates. Effectively incorporating surface reconstruction behavior could significantly improve catalyst activity. This work effectively combines 1D Ir-based materials and surface reconstruction, which provides a strategy for the subsequent full utilization of Ir-based materials applied on OER process.</description>

                Abstract The discovery of non&#8208;precious catalysts for replacing the precious metal of ruthenium in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a key step in reducing the cost of green hydrogen production. The 2D d &#8208;MHOFs, a new 2D materials with controllable oxygen vacancies formed by controlling the degree of coordination bridging between metal hydroxyl oxide and BDC ligands are synthesized at room temperature, exhibit excellent OER properties with low overpotentials of 207 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 . High&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy images and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the introduction of oxygen vacancy sites leads to a lattice distortion and charge redistribution in the catalysts, enhancing the OER activity of 2D d &#8208;MHOFs comprehensively. Synchrotron radiation and in situ Raman/Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicate that part of oxygen defect sites on the surface of 2D d &#8208;MHOFs are prone to transition to highly active metal hydroxyl oxides during the OER process. This work provides a mild strategy for scalable preparation of 2D d &#8208;MHOFs nanosheets with controllable oxygen defects, reveals the relationship between oxygen vacancies and OER performance, and offers a profound insight into the basic process of structural transformation in the OER process.</description>

      <title>Modulating space charge of FeP/CoP p-n heterojunction for boosting oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2024.03.060</link>

                Surface reconstruction of electrocatalysts is an effective strategy to modulate the space charge distribution to enhance the electrocatalytic activity. The p-n heterostructured FeP/CoP-2D octagonal nanoplates were successfully constructed by cation-exchange method. The space charge effect caused by the p-n heterojunction accelerated the electron transfer, optimized the electronic structure, and improved the activity of the active sites during the oxygen evolution reaction process. As a result, FeP/CoP-2D required only 247 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with a Tafel slope as low as 68 mV dec-1. Density-functional theory calculations confirmed that the construction of p-n heterojunctions can enhance the adsorption of *OH in the active centers and optimize the Gibbs free energy of the OER reaction. This study provides an effective and feasible strategy for constructing p-n heterojunctions to modulate the space charge state for optimizing the OER performance of electrocatalysts.</description>

                Electrocatalysts with high activity and long-term durability are vital toward large-scale hydrogen production from electrocatalytic water splitting. Here, the self-supported electrode (FeOxHy@Ni3B/NF) with hierarchical heterostructure was simply prepared by using Ni3B chunks grown on nickel foam as substrate to in situ form vertical FeOxHy nanosheets. Such hybrid shows efficient oxygen evolution reaction activity with overpotentials as low as 267 and 249 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 in 1 M KOH solution and 30 wt% KOH solution, respectively. Meanwhile, it also exhibits excellent catalytic stability, sustaining catalysis at 500 mA cm&#8722;2 in 1 M KOH solution for 200 h, and even for 200 h at 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 in 30 wt% KOH solution. Further experimental results reveal that the FeOxHy@Ni3B/NF is endowed with superhydrophilic and superaerophobic surface properties, which not only provide more mass transport channels, as well as facilitated the diffusion of reaction intermediates and gas bubbles. Also, it holds faster reaction kinetics, more accessible active sites and accelerated electron transfer rates due to strong synergistic interactions at the heterogeneous interface.</description>

      <title>A review on synthesis and modification of cobalt-molybdenum based sulfides as hydrogen and oxygen evolution catalysts for water electrolysis</title>

                Hydrogen energy as the alternative to fossil fuel received wide attention. Among different methods of hydrogen production, water electrolysis is the cleanest and most promising method. However, its development is greatly limited by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) reaction and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) reaction. Therefore, it is very necessary to develop low-cost, high activity, and good stability of non-precious metal catalyst to replace the precious metal catalyst (Pt, RuO2), and to further reduce overpotential and power consumption. To date, great efforts have been made to develop transition metal compounds with electrocatalytic performance, such as sulfides, oxides, and carbides materials. Especially, transition metal sulfides play a very important role as catalysts and have attracted wide attention for their structural adjustability, high abundance, and mild preparation process. In this introduction, we focus on the role of transition metal sulfides in catalysts for water electrolysis, especially in a few most studied sulfides such as cobalt/molybdenum based sulfides and the recently reported homogeneous cobalt-molybdenum based sulfides, in which cobalt acts as a key element. Composition, morphology, and size are the most important factors that influence the intrinsic activity, electrical conductivity, and electronic structure of these transition metal sulfides. Besides, the effect of carbon nanomaterials as carrier materials is also discussed. The aim of this review is to emphasize the great potentials of cobalt and molybdenum based sulfides with high performance, and to help improve the performance of existing sulfides and explore new modification methods.</description>
