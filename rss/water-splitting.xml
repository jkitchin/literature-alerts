      <title>Optimizing Oxygen-Production Kinetics of Manganese Dioxide Nanoparticles Improves Hypoxia Reversal and Survival in Mice with Bone Metastases</title>

                Persistent hypoxia in bone metastases induces an immunosuppressive environment, limiting the effectiveness of immunotherapies. To address chronic hypoxia, we have developed manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles with tunable oxygen production kinetics for sustained oxygenation in bone metastases lesions. Using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-stabilized MnO2 or poly(lactic[50]-co-glycolic[50] acid) (50:50 PLGA), poly(lactic[75]-co-glycolic[25] acid) (75:25 PLGA), and polylactic acid (PLA)-encapsulated MnO2 NPs, we demonstrate that polymer hydrophobicity attenuates burst oxygen production and enables tunable oxygen production kinetics. The PEG-MnO2 NPs resulted in rapid hypoxia reduction in spheroids, which was rapidly attenuated, while the PLA-MnO2 NPs exhibited delayed hypoxia control in cancer spheroids. The 50:50 PLGA-MnO2 NPs exhibited the best short- and long-term control of hypoxia in cancer spheroids, resulting in sustained regulation of the expression of HIF-1&#945; and immunosuppressive genes. The sustained control of hypoxia by the 50:50 PLGA-MnO2 NPs enhanced the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells against cancer spheroids. In vivo, 50:50 PLGA-MnO2 showed greater accumulation in the long bones and pelvis, common sites for bone metastases. The NPs decreased hypoxia in bone metastases and decreased regulatory T cell levels, resulting in enhanced survival of mice with established bone metastases.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and characterisation of CrMnFeCoNi high entropy alloy electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmt.2024.102128</link>

                Water electrolysis is attracting increasing attention in becoming the main method for green energy production, which has long been hindered by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and high cost of noble-metal (NM) containing electrodes. Template replication technique has been employed to fabricate porous CrMnFeCoNi high entropy alloy (HEA) bulk foams with &gt; 95 % porosity. High entropy led to the formation of a single-phase solid solution of transition metals in the as-fabricated porous HEA bulk foam, and the lattice distortion brings about the outstanding OER performance that is close to that of the RuO2 reference sample. Effective electrochemically active surface area and amount of exposed active sites are increased by grinding into nanoparticles, which produced superior OER performance with a near-record low overpotential of &#8764; 245 mV to drive a current density of 10 mA/cm2, a low Tafel slope of 73.6 mV/dec, a double layer capacitance of 102.3 mF, and excellent long-term stability over 24 h. This work demonstrates a cost-effective way to fabricate NM-free HEA electrocatalyst with complex structure and excellent stability in OER, which could help in advancing the research for alkaline water electrolysis.</description>

      <title>Transpassive Metal Dissolution vs. Oxygen Evolution Reaction: Implication for Alloy Stability and Electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202317058</link>
      <description>Annica Wetzel, Daniel Morell, Marcus von der Au, G&#252;nther Wittstock, &#214;zlem &#214;zcan, Julia Witt, Angewandte Chemie. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391944172

                Multi&#8208;principal element alloys (MPEAs) are gaining interest in corrosion and electrocatalysis research due to their electrochemical stability across a broad pH range and the design flexibility they offer. Using the equimolar CrCoNi alloy, we observe significant metal dissolution in a corrosive electrolyte (0.1 M NaCl, pH 2) concurrently with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the transpassive region despite the absence of hysteresis in polarization curves or other obvious corrosion indicators. We present a characterization scheme to delineate the contribution of OER and alloy dissolution, using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for OER&#8208;onset detection, and quantitative chemical analysis with inductively coupled&#8208;mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) and ultraviolet visible light (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy to elucidate metal dissolution processes. In&#8208;situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC&#8208;AFM) revealed that the transpassive metal dissolution on CrCoNi is dominated by intergranular corrosion. These results have significant implications for the stability of MPEAs in corrosion systems, emphasizing the necessity of analytically determining metal ions released from MPEA electrodes into the electrolyte when evaluating Faradaic efficiencies of OER catalysts. The release of transition metal ions not only reduces the Faradaic efficiency of electrolyzers but may also cause poisoning and degradation of membranes in electrochemical reactors.</description>

      <title>Alkali Containing Layered Metal Oxides as Catalysts for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/celc.202300761</link>
      <description>Mario Falsaperna, Rosa Arrigo, Frank Marken, Simon J. Freakley, ChemElectroChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391948002

                Abstract Improving the efficiency of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is essential to realise energy systems based on water electrolysis. Many catalysts have been developed for the OER to date, with iridium&#8208;based oxides being the most promising due to their relative stability towards corrosion in acidic electrolytes under oxidising potentials. In recent years, examples of catalysts adopting layered structures have been shown to have promising characteristics such as higher conductivity and higher electrochemically active surface area compared to highly crystalline metal oxides. Furthermore, such materials possess additional tuneable properties such as interlayer spacing, identity and concentration of the interlayer species, edge and interlayer active sites, and higher active surface area. Recent attention has focused on mono&#8208; and polymetallic lithium&#8208;containing layered materials, where the presence of interlayer lithium cations, in situ delithiation processes and combinations of transition metal oxides result in enhanced catalytic properties towards OER. This review aims to provide a summary of the recent developments of such layered materials, in which lithium or other alkali metal ions occupy interlayer sites in oxides.</description>

      <title>Glassy State Hydroxide Materials for Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202312168</link>
      <description>Jing Wang, Jingyu Chen, Jian Zhang, Qiang Gao, Bo Han, Ruimin Sun, Chenggang Zhou, Zhao Cai, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4391952436

                Abstract Hydroxides are the archetype of layered crystals with metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8208;O) octahedron units, which have been widely investigated as oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts. However, the better crystallinity of hydroxide materials, the more perfect octahedral symmetry and atomic ordering, resulting in the less exposed metal sites and limited electrocatalytic activity. Herein, a glassy state hydroxide material featuring with short&#8208;range order and long&#8208;range disorder structure is developed to achieve high intrinsic activity for OER. Specifically, a rapid freezing point precipitation method is utilized to fabricate amorphous multi&#8208;component hydroxide. Owing to the freezing&#8208;point crystallization environment and chaotic M&#8208;O (M = Ni/Fe/Co/Mn/Cr etc.) structures, the as&#8208;fabricated NiFeCoMnCr hydroxide exhibit a highly&#8208;disordered glassy structure, as&#8208;confirmed by X&#8208;ray/electron diffraction, enthalpic response, and pair distribution function analysis. The as&#8208;achieved glassy&#8208;state hydroxide materials display a low OER overpotential of 269 mV at 20 mA cm &#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 33.3 mV dec &#8722;1 , outperform the benchmark noble&#8208;metal RuO 2 catalyst (341 mV, 84.9 mV dec &#8722;1 ) . Operando Raman and density functional theory studies reveal that the glassy state hydroxide converted into disordered active oxyhydroxide phase with optimized oxygen intermediates adsorption under low OER overpotentials, thus boosting the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity.</description>

                Abstract Dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) hold a higher metal atom loading and provide greater flexibility in terms of the structural characteristics of their active sites in comparison to SACs. Consequently, DACs hold great promise for achieving improved catalytic performance. This article aims to provide a focused overview of the latest advancements in DACs, covering their synthesis and mechanisms in reversible oxygen electrocatalysis, which plays a key role in sustainable energy conversion and storage technologies. The discussion starts by highlighting the structures of DACs and the differences in diatomic coordination induced by various substrates. Subsequently, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication strategies of DACs for oxygen electrocatalysis are discussed from several different perspectives. It particularly highlights the challenges of increasing the diatomic loading capacity. More importantly, the main focus of this overview is to investigate the correlation between the configuration and activity in DACs in order to gain a deeper understanding of their active roles in oxygen electrocatalysis. This will be achieved through density functional theory (DFT) calculations and sophisticated in situ characterization technologies. The aim is to provide guidelines for optimizing and upgrading DACs in oxygen electrocatalysis. Additionally, the overview discusses the current challenges and future prospects in this rapidly evolving area of research. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved</description>

      <title>A fingerprint-like supramolecular-assembled Ag3PO4/polydopamine/g-C3N4 heterojunction nanocomposite for enhanced solar-driven oxygen evolution in vivo</title>

                Biocompatible photocatalytic water-splitting systems are promising for tissue self-oxygenation. Herein, a structure&#8211;function dual biomimetic fingerprint-like silver phosphate/polydopamine/graphitic carbon nitride (Ag3PO4/PDA/g-C3N4) heterojunction nanocomposite is proposed for enhanced solar-driven oxygen (O2) evolution in vivo in situ. Briefly, a porous nitrogen-defected g-C3N4 nanovoile (CN) is synthesized as the base. Dopamine molecules are controllably inserted into the CN interlayer, forming PDA spacers (4.28 nm) through self-polymerization-induced supramolecular-assembly. Ag3PO4 nanoparticles are then in situ deposited to create Ag3PO4/PDA/CN. The fingerprint-like structure of PDA/CN enlarges the layer spacing, thereby accelerating mass transfer and increasing reaction sites. The PDA spacer roles as excellent light harvester, electronic-ionic conductor, and redox pair through conformational changes, resulting in tailored electronic band structure, optimized carrier behavior, and reduced electrochemical impedance. In physiological conditions, Ag3PO4/PDA/CN exhibits O2 evolution rate of 45.35 &#956;mol&#8901;g&#8722;1&#8901;h&#8722;1, 9-fold of bulk g-C3N4. The biocompatibility and in vivo oxygen supply effectiveness for biomedical applications have been verified in animal models.</description>

                Abstract Designing and fabricating highly efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic materials for water splitting is a promising and practical approach to green and sustainable low&#8208;carbon energy systems. Herein, a facile in situ growth self&#8208;template strategy by using ZIF&#8208;67 as a consumable layered double hydroxides (LDHs) template and silver nanowires (AgNWs) as 1D conductive cascaded substrate to controllably synthesize the target AgNWs@CoFe&#8208;LDH composites with unique hollow shell sugar gourd&#8208;like structure and enhanced directional electron transport effect is reported. The AgNWs exhibit the key functions of the close connection of CoFe&#8208;LDH nanocages and the support of the directional electron transport effect in the composite catalyst inducing electrons directionally moving from CoFe&#8208;LDH to AgNWs. Meanwhile, the CoFe&#8208;LDH nanocages with ultrathin nanosheets and hollow structural properties show abundant active sites for electrocatalytic oxygen generation. The versatile AgNWs@CoFe&#8208;LDH catalyst with optimized components, enhanced directional electron transport, and synergistic effect achieves high OER performance with the overpotential of 207 mV and long&#8208;term 50 h stability at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in an alkaline medium. Moreover, in&#8208;depth insights into the microstructure, structure&#8208;activity relationships, identification of key intermediate species, and a proton&#8208;coupled four&#8208;electron OER mechanism based on experimental discovery and theoretical calculation are also demonstrated.</description>

                Abstract Designing robust and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for efficient alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is of great significance in the field of water electrolysis. In this study, we introduce an electrochemical strategy to activate stainless steel (SS) electrodes for efficient OER. By cycling the SS electrode within a potential window that encompasses the Fe(II)&#8596;Fe(III) process, we can greatly enhance its OER activity compared to using a potential window that excludes this redox reaction, decreasing the overpotential at current density of 100 mA cm &#8722;2 by 40 mV. Electrochemical characterization, Inductively Coupled Plasma &#8211; Optical Emission Spectroscopy and operando Raman measurements demonstrated that the Fe leaching at the SS surface can be accelerated through a Fe &#8594; &#947;&#8208;Fe 2 O 3 &#8594; Fe 3 O 4 or FeO &#8594; Fe 2+ (aq.) conversion process, leading to the sustained exposure of Cr and Ni species. While Cr leaching occurs during its oxidation process, Ni species display higher resistance to leaching and gradually accumulate on the SS surface in the form of OER&#8208;active Fe&#8208;incorporated NiOOH species. Furthermore, a potential&#8208;pulse strategy was also introduced to regenerate the OER&#8208;activity of 316&#8208;type SS for stable OER, both in the three&#8208;electrode configuration (without performance decay after 300 h at 350 mA cm &#8722;2 ) and in an alkaline water electrolyzer (ca. 30 mV cell voltage increase after accelerated stress test&#8208;AST). The AST&#8208;stabilized cell can still reach 1000 mA cm &#8722;2 and 4000 mA cm &#8722;2 at cell voltages of 1.69 V and 2.1 V, which makes it competitive with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrolyzers based on ion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membranes using Ir&#8208;based anodes.

      <title>Silver zirconate: A versatile visible light harvesting photocatalyst for oxygen evolution, PMS activation, and bactericidal activity</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jphotochem.2024.115537</link>

                Herein, we have synthesized silver zirconate using a co-precipitation method at room temperature. The synthesized Ag2ZrO3 (SZ) was then subjected to calcination at different temperatures (300 &#176;C, 500 &#176;C, and 700 &#176;C). The synthesized Ag2ZrO3 material was evaluated for its photocatalytic oxygen evolution, activation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) ions, and antibacterial activity under visible light irradiation. Among the different samples, the SZ sample (Ag2ZrO3 synthesized at room temperature) exhibited the highest photocatalytic oxygen evolution rate (2175.02 &#956;molg-1h&#8722;1). This enhanced performance can be attributed to the higher surface area of SZ compared to the other samples. Furthermore, all four samples were tested for the photoactivation of peroxymonosulfate (PMS) ions to assess their ability for the decontamination of organic pollutant. The SZ photocatalyst demonstrated complete degradation (100 %) of RhB dye (2.1 &#215; 10-5 M) within 120 min of visible light irradiation in the presence of PMS. In contrast, without PMS, only 54.33 % degradation of RhB was recorded in 300 min. This result indicates that SZ effectively activates PMS ions for the degradation of organic pollutants. Additionally, SZ exhibited excellent bactericidal activity against E. coli and S. aureus bacteria, both in the dark and in the presence of visible light. The findings demonstrate the multifunctional properties of Ag2ZrO3, making it suitable for a wide range of environmental remediation applications.</description>

      <title>Sulfate anchored on the defective NiO by ion irradiation realizes enhanced oxygen evolution reaction</title>

                NiO has attracted wide attention in the past decade as a cost-effective electrochemical catalyst for OER. However, its relatively poor performance and conductivity limit its commercial applications. Here, we highlight a unique ion irradiation method to enhance the catalytic activity of NiO. Benefiting from sulfate anchoring and the introduction of oxygen vacancies by He+ ion irradiation, the optimal catalyst (ir-S-NiO) exhibits an outstanding OER performance with a low overpotential of 269 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. Moreover, the fabricated Anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) constructed by the ir-S-NiO is demonstrated to need a cell voltage of 1.72 V to reach a current density of 0.1 A cm&#8722;2 and shows remarkably long-term stability for 200 h without obvious attenuation at the current density of 0.5 A cm&#8722;2. This work provides a new method for the development of high-performance and stable OER electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Construction of nickel phosphide/iron oxyhydroxide heterostructure nanoparticles for oxygen evolution</title>

                Active and stable oxygen evolution electrocatalysts are essential in increasing the efficiency of the water electrolyzers. The Ni2P/Fe(O)OH heterostructure nanoparticles are prepared via solvothermal phosphidization of Ni metal-organic frameworks (MOF) followed by immersing in Fe3+ aqueous solution. Characterizations reveal that the Ni2P/Fe(O)OH heterostructure nanoparticles are 12.83 nm in size averagely, and the heterointerface induces electron interactions between the Ni2P and Fe(O)OH phases. When used to catalyze OER in alkaline solutions, the Ni2P/Fe(O)OH-40/nickel foam (NF) is the most active and exhibits 240 mV overpotential to reach 10 mA cm-2 oxygen evolution (OER) current densities, which is significantly better than the Ni2P/NF. Lower apparent activation energy, charge transfer resistance, and Tafel slope, along with higher electron rate constant are observed at Ni2P/Fe(O)OH-40/NF, which suggests that the OER kinetics is more facile at the heterostructure surface. Both Ni2P/Fe(O)OH-40/NF and Ni2P/NF involve decoupled electron and proton transfer process, and higher degree of lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM) participation is observed at Ni2P/Fe(O)OH-40/NF, which results from the increased acidity of the Ni3+ sites. Density functional theory calculations prove that the formation of heterostructure with Fe(O)OH alters the band structure and the OER intermediate adsorption energies, that lead to lower energy barrier in the rate-determining step. The Ni2P/Fe(O)OH-40/NF is also stable towards OER in alkaline solutions.</description>

                Abstract Water electrolysis is a crucial technology for independency on fossil fuels. However, water splitting is limited by the sluggish kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While many studies report highly active, non&#8208;precious metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts for alkaline OER, applicability under industrial conditions is often omitted. Such conditions require catalysts being applied on nickel or nickel&#8208;containing alloys in elevated electrolyte concentrations. In contrast to the rather inert substrates often used in scientific studies, such industrially applied substrates exhibit significant OER activity themselves and show dynamic behaviour. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the OER behaviour of such substrates. Here, nickel and seven commercially available nickel&#8208;containing alloys are investigated as anodes in alkaline OER and their elemental compositions correlated to their corresponding activities. Repeated potential cycling across the Ni(II)/Ni(III)&#8208;redox couple is established as activity&#8208;enhancing procedure. Overall, the nickel&#8208;base alloy Hastelloy&#174; X exhibits the highest activity due to its Fe&#8208;, Cr&#8208;, Mo&#8208; and Co&#8208;content. Though, the activity gain differs significantly for the various materials. Comparing Ni and Hastelloy&#174; X as least and most active materials, the positive impact of activation on both activity and stability becomes evident. While untreated Ni suffers from poor OER stability, the activity&#8208;enhancing procedure also significantly increases electrode stability in 24 h chronopotentiometry.</description>

                Developing ruthenium&#8208;based heterogeneous catalysts with an efficient and stable interface is essential for enhanced acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, we report a defect&#8208;rich ultrathin boron nitride nanosheet support with relatively independent electron donor and acceptor sites, which serves as an electron reservoir and receiving station for RuO2, realizing the rapid supply and reception of electrons. Through precisely controlling the reaction interface, a low OER overpotential of only 180 mV (at 10 mA cm&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term operational stability (350 h) are achieved, suggesting potential practical applications. In&#8208;situ characterization and theoretical calculations have validated the existence of a localized electronic recycling between RuO2 and BNNS. The electron&#8208;rich Ru sites accelerate the adsorption of water molecules and the dissociation of intermediates, while the interconnection between the O&#8208;terminal and B&#8208;terminal edge establishes electronic back&#8208;donation, effectively suppressing the over&#8208;oxidation of lattice oxygen. This study provides a new perspective for constructing a stable and highly active catalytic interface.</description>

      <title>Transpassive Metal Dissolution vs. Oxygen Evolution Reaction: Implication for Alloy Stability and Electrocatalysis</title>

                Multi&#8208;principal element alloys (MPEAs) are gaining interest in corrosion and electrocatalysis research due to their electrochemical stability across a broad pH range and the design flexibility they offer. Using the equimolar CrCoNi alloy, we observe significant metal dissolution in a corrosive electrolyte (0.1 M NaCl, pH 2) concurrently with the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the transpassive region despite the absence of hysteresis in polarization curves or other obvious corrosion indicators. We present a characterization scheme to delineate the contribution of OER and alloy dissolution, using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) for OER&#8208;onset detection, and quantitative chemical analysis with inductively coupled&#8208;mass spectrometry (ICP&#8208;MS) and ultraviolet visible light (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy to elucidate metal dissolution processes. In&#8208;situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC&#8208;AFM) revealed that the transpassive metal dissolution on CrCoNi is dominated by intergranular corrosion. These results have significant implications for the stability of MPEAs in corrosion systems, emphasizing the necessity of analytically determining metal ions released from MPEA electrodes into the electrolyte when evaluating Faradaic efficiencies of OER catalysts. The release of transition metal ions not only reduces the Faradaic efficiency of electrolyzers but may also cause poisoning and degradation of membranes in electrochemical reactors.</description>

                Electrochemical water splitting is a process that shows promise for the sustainable conversion, storage, and delivery of hydrogen energy. The support development of electrocatalysts that support hydrogen and oxygen evolution processes (HER/OER) without requiring precious metals and with superior activity and durability is crucial for the broad adoption of water electrolysis. Compared to the traditional powder-coated type, a freestanding electrode architecture exhibits superior stability and kinetics. In this study, the layered FeTe-PANI nanocomposite is designed for hydrogen generation. Various nanostructures of FeTe-PANI like nanorods and nanosheets by controllable expansion of surfactants such as hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) can be adjusted to agglomerations. The nanosheets combined with nanorods (FeTe-PANI) show remarkable electrocatalytic activity with 195 mV overpotentials at 10 mAcm&#8722;2 for OER. Additionally, FeTe-PANI employed in a 2-electrode electrolyzer as a cathodic electrode electrocatalyst in 1.0 Molar potassium hydroxide media, yields a cell voltage of 1.52 V at a current density of 10 mAcm&#8722;2 with a noteworthy 80 h sturdiness, making it an ideal electrocatalyst towards empirical deployment of water splitting electrolyzers.</description>

      <title>Constructions of hierarchical nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes anchored on CoFe2O4 nanoflakes for efficient hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution and oxygen reduction reaction</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpowsour.2024.234218</link>

                The three primary reactions in metal-air batteries and electrochemical hydrolysis are the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Therefore, it is crucial to develop efficient low-cost trifunctional catalysts. In this study, we design a self-supported electrocatalyst with hierarchical nanostructure, in which the bamboo-like nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) encapsulated CoFe nanoparticles (CoFe NPs) in-situ anchored on nanoflower like CoFe2O4 via chemical vapor deposition. Strikingly, the resulting catalysts CoFe@NC/CoFe2O4/IF demonstrate exciting trifunctional catalytic performance, overpotential of 66 mV and 185 mV for HER and OER at current densities of 10 mA cm&#8722;2, and a half-wave potential of 0.852 V for ORR, respectively. In addition, the maximum power density of the Zinc-air batteries (ZABs) assembled with CoFe@NC/CoFe2O4/IF as the cathode electrode is 134.5 mW cm&#8722;2; and the overall water splitting requires only a voltage of 1.50 V at a decomposition current density at 10 mA cm&#8722;2. This method provides a new strategy for trifunctional electrocatalysts and offers a promising approach for self-driven water electrolysis devices.</description>

      <title>Boosting activity on molten salt-synthesized Ce doped cobalt hydroxyl nitrate nanorods by oxygen vacancies for efficient oxygen evolution</title>

                Rationalizing the development of highly active, non-precious electrocatalysts through facile and cost-effective synthesis methods for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) constitutes a paramount research objective. In this study, we introduce an innovative molten salt approach to fabricate an arrayed nanorod architecture supported on a cobalt foam substrate denoted as Ce doped cobalt hydroxyl nitrate (Ce-CoNH). Cerium (Ce) is strategically employed to induce oxygen vacancies and effect localized electronic structure modifications of the cobalt (Co) sites. In comparison to individual CoNH catalysts, Ce-CoNH exhibits exceptional catalytic activity in alkaline water oxidation, achieving a notably low overpotential of 270 mV at a current density of 50 mA cm&#8722;2. Notably, the Ce-CoNH catalyst also demonstrates remarkable durability, sustaining a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 for an impressive duration of 50 h, surpassing the performance of Ce-free CoNH samples, which can be attributed to the flexible influence of Ce doping and the robust nanorod structure. Collectively, our study underscores the viability of molten salt-synthesized heteroatom substitution, accompanied by the introduction of defect-rich structures, as an effective strategy for the rational design of advanced electrocatalysts tailored for water electrolysis applications.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopy of electrochemical transformations on a metal-oxide surface during oxygen evolution from water</title>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) from water fuels the planet through photosynthesis and is a primary means for hydrogen storage in energy technologies. Yet the detection of intermediates of OER central to the catalytic mechanism has been an ongoing challenge. This review covers the relevance of ultrafast electronic and vibrational spectroscopy of the electrochemical transformations of a metal-oxide surface undergoing OER. The electron doped SrTiO3/electrolyte is the system under review because of its high photocurrent efficiency with an ultrafast light trigger and because it allowed for detection of intermediate forms across the electromagnetic spectrum. The first part covers how the efficient catalytic reaction is triggered by ultrafast light pulses, describing the Schottky diode, the depletion layer, and Helmholtz layer under operating conditions to the extent possible. The second part covers the detection of the surface bound intermediates by transient spectroscopy. These target ultrafast (ps-ns) electron transfer from (or hole-trapping to) bound surface water species that are associated with the reactive oxygen intermediates of OER (e.g. OH*, O*). Their detection via a broadband visible probe, a mid-infrared evanescent wave, and coherent acoustic waves is then described. These target, respectively, the electronic states, the vibrational levels, and the lattice strain associated with the intermediates. The review is primarily concerned with how the measurements are made and the intermediates&#8217; experimental spectra. The theoretical descriptions are brought in as a needed to provide context to spectra that are difficult to interpret on their own. A concluding section summarizes the essential findings and methodologies.</description>
