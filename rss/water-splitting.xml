                Abstract Low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts are crucial for water electrolysis. Herein, the synthesis of low&#8208;cost Fe/P&#8208;CoO 2 amorphous catalyst is reported, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 260 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 in 1 m KOH. Assembled Pt/C||Co 0.75 Fe 0.25 P/MWCNTs system affords a current density of 10 mA cm &#8722;2 at a cell voltage of only 1.53 V, which is much better than that of the benchmark Pt/C||RuO 2 system (1.62 V). Such performance lies ointhe electronic mediation of active sites with asymmetric Co&#8208; and Fe&#8208;coordination structures with different d&#8208;band occupancy. The combination of Fe&#8208;cationic and P&#8208;anionic coordination effectively optimizes the adsorption of OER intermediates (OH * , O * ), promoting direct O * &#9472;O * coupling and avoiding the formation of unstable OOH * intermediate. Benefiting from these advantages, Co 0.75 Fe 0.25 P/MWCNTs demonstrate excellent OER activity and stability, surpassing the benchmark RuO 2 . The proposed strategy presents a novel approach for the synthesis of cost&#8208;effective, highly efficient, and durable electrocatalysts for alkaline OER.</description>

                Abstract Ruthenium oxide (RuO 2 ) is considered one of the most promising catalysts for replacing iridium oxide (IrO 2 ) in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Nevertheless, the performance of RuO 2 remains unacceptable due to the dissolution of Ru and the lack of *OH in acidic environments. This paper reports a grain boundary (GB)&#8208;rich porous RuO 2 electrocatalyst for the efficient and stable acidic OER. The involvement of GB regulates the valence state of Ru and weakens the interaction between Ru and O, effectively facilitating *OH adsorption and *OOH formation. Notably, achieved a record&#8208;high catalytic activity (145 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 ) with a low Tafel slope (40.9 mV dec &#8722;1 ) and a remarkable mass activity of 332 mA mg &#8722;1 Ru at 1.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode is achieved. Additionally, the porous RuO 2 exhibits superb stability with an ultra&#8208;low degradation rate of 26 &#181;V h &#8722;1 over a 50&#8208;day durability test. This study opens a viable pathway for the development of efficient and robust Ru&#8208;based acidic OER electrocatalysts.</description>

                The high cost and low energy efficiency of conventional water electrolysis methods continue to restrict the widespread adoption of green hydrogen. Anion exchange membrane (AEM) water electrolysis is a promising technology that can produce hydrogen using cost-effective transition metal catalysts at high energy efficiency. Herein, we investigate the catalytic activity of nickel and iron nanoparticles dispersed on metal-oxide supports for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), employing electrochemical testing with an anion exchange ionomer to evaluate their potential for application in AEM electrolyzers. We report the electrochemical performance of NiFe nanoparticles of varying Ni:Fe ratios on CeO2 for OER reaction, assessing the overpotential, Tafel slope and electrochemical stability of the catalysts. Our findings indicate that Ni90Fe10 has the highest catalytic activity as well as stability. To further understand the role of different supports, we assess the electrocatalytic performance of Ni90Fe10 nanoparticles on two more supports - TiO2 and ZrO2. While CeO2 has the lowest overpotential, the other supports also show high activity and good performance at high current density. TiO2 exhibits superior stability and its overpotential after chronopotentiometry measurements approaches that of CeO2 at high current densities. These results underscore the critical role of iron addition in enhancing nickel nanoparticles' catalytic activity and further emphasize the importance of metal oxide supports in improving catalyst stability and performance.</description>

      <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Sulfide Oxidation Paired With CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Reduction Based on Vacancies Engineering of Copper Selenide</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/smll.202411269</link>
      <description>Zhongke Wang, Qixing Zhang, Jin Wang, Han He, San-Jiang Pan, Ying Zhao, Xiaodan Zhang, Small. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405700116

                Abstract Photovoltaic&#8208;driven electrochemical (PV&#8208;EC) carbon dioxide reduction (CO 2 R) coupled with sulfide oxidation (SOR) can efficiently convert the solar energy into chemical energy, expanding its applications. However, developing low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts that exhibit high selectivity and efficiency for both CO 2 R and SOR remains a challenge. Herein, a bifunctional copper selenide catalyst is developed with copper vacancies (v&#8208;CuSe 2 ) for the CO 2 R&#8208;SOR. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 62.4% for methane at &#8722;200 mA cm &#8722;2 is achieved in the cathodic CO 2 R. In a two&#8208;electrode CO 2 R&#8208;SOR system with 16 h of long&#8208;term operation at a current density of 200 mA cm &#8722;2 , an average Faradaic efficiency of 57.2% for methane and 97.7% for sulfur powder generation is achieved at cathode and anode, respectively. Compared to the coupling of CO 2 R with oxygen evolution reaction (OER), the energy efficiency (EE) of the CO 2 R&#8208;SOR system can be increased to 22.9%. The mechanism study has found that the synergistic effect of copper vacancies and introduced Se significantly enhances the selectivity toward methane. Driven by silicon solar cells, a solar&#8208;to&#8208;methane conversion efficiency of 2% is achieved.</description>

      <title>A Review on Photocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production from Oxygen: Material Design, Mechanisms, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.4c14902</link>
      <description>Zonglin Jiang, Chen Li, Fei Qi, Zhenbei Wang, Yatao Liu, Fan Li, Hui Wang, Zhaoyong Bian, Mingshan Zhu, Jolanta Kumirska, Ewa Maria Siedlecka, ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405703285

                Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) finds extensive applications in various industries, particularly in the environmental field. The photocatalytic production of H2O2 through the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or the water oxidation reaction (WOR) offers a promising approach. However, several challenges hinder effective on-site production, such as the rapid electron&#8211;hole pair recombination, inefficient visible light utilization, and limited selectivity in H2O2 formation. Thus, developing efficient photocatalysts to overcome these challenges is crucial. This review comprehensively outlines the development of photocatalysts and their modification techniques. It also summarizes and compares the H2O2 yield and apparent quantum yield among various photocatalysts with and without the use of organic sacrificial reagents. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations propose the band structure of photocatalysts and the mechanisms underlying oxygen reduction to H2O2. Finally, this review explores the potential environmental applications of photocatalytically produced H2O2. This review guides the design and optimization of photocatalysts, facilitating the continued advancement and application of photocatalysts in environmental contexts.</description>

                MXene 2D materials and non&#8208;noble transition metal oxide nanoparticles have been proposed as novel pH&#8208;universal platforms for oxygen evolution reaction (OER), owing to the enhancement of active site exposures and conductivity. Herein, Co3O4&#8208;RuO2 /Ti3C2Tx/carbon cloths (CRMC) were assembled in a facile way as an efficient OER platform through a hydrothermal process. The Co3O4&#8208;RuO2/Ti3C2Tx demonstrated prominent OER catalytic performance under acidic and alkaline conditions, which showed overpotential values of 195 and 247 mV at 10 mA cm&#8208;2 with Tafel slopes of 93 and 97 mVdec&#8208;1, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated that the electron transfer from Co3O4&#8208;RuO2 to Ti3C2Tx/carbon cloth played a remarkable role in promoting OER catalytic activity. Further OER characterization indicated that the enhanced multi&#8208;electron reaction kinetics are attributed to Co and Ru acting as the primary active places for O2 adsorption and activation, which facilitated the generation of *OOH intermediate.</description>

                Oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER, respectively) are the two most extensively studied reactions in electrochemistry. Herein, we report the synthesis of Co3O4/CeO2/GNP (GNP=graphene nanoplatelet) electrocatalyst for ORR and OER that exhibits an early onset potential (0.85 V) and half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) of 0.69 V for ORR. The reported catalyst is highly durable with 87.6% retention of its initial current after a 6 h chronoamperometry test compared to 72.5% by Pt/C. It exhibits a negligible shift of E1/2 after 10,000 potential cycles for ORR. Heterogeneous oxide/oxide interfaces, oxygen vacancies and semicrystalline nature are inferenced to play a dominant role in altering the collective catalytic efficiency of Co3O4/CeO2/GNP. High concentration of oxygen vacancy defects (68%) in Co3O4/CeO2/GNP is presumed to play a dominant role here. The catalyst is bifunctional for ORR and OER with a bifunctionality index of 0.98 V and operates at an overpotential of &#414;10= 440 mV for OER. Ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption studies indicate an increased average oxidation state of Co by 15% in Co3O4/CeO2/GNP compared to Co3O4/GNP, aiding in preserving its inherent catalytic nature of spinel Co3O4.</description>

                FeOOH with excellent catalytic properties for oxygen evolution and also considered to be a true active site has attracted great interest in recent years. However, the intrinsic low conductivity limits its catalytic performance. Herein, a one&#8208;dimensional core&#8208;shell NiMoO4/FeOOH heterojunction with high OER activity and stability was developed. At current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm&#8208;2, low overpotentials of 194 and 266 mV are need to drive oxygen evolution, meanwhile, the electrode exhibits high catalytic kinetics with small Tafel slopes of 53.4 mV dec&#8208;1 and excellent stability over 100 hours. Further analysis showed that the ultrathin FeOOH layer (~5 nm) uniformly covered the surface of NiMoO4 nanorods, acting as an active species and facilitating the surface change transfer to the interior. The internal NiMoO4 cores, on the other hand, provides reliable electron transmission as a highly conductive medium, and can effectively overcome the low conductivity of FeOOH. DFT calculations further manifest the strong electronic interactions between NiMoO4 and FeOOH species. The NiMoO4 core serves as mass transport of active materials is beneficial to tune the adsorption energy of OH&#8208; on the surface of electrocatalysts.</description>

                The photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from oxygen (O2) represents a promising catalytic pathway, the limited efficiency of the oxygen reduction constitutes a primary barrier to enhancing production. In this content, alkali metal potassium (K+) and Br&#8208;doped g&#8208;C3N4 photocatalysts (K&#8208;CN) were successfully constructed by one&#8208;pot method. The introduction of K+ is not only beneficial to the transmission of space charge and the separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers, but also promotes the efficient production of H2O2 by 2e&#8208; oxygen reduction reaction. The introduction of Br&#8208; promotes O2 converted to triplet state and triggers energy transfer process to increase 1O2 production, O2 adsorption was facilitated through regulating the oxygen evolution (O2&#8594;1O2), which is beneficial to the subsequent oxygen reduction process. The results showed that the H2O2 yield of 0.05 K&#8208;CN catalyst reached 26.0 mmol g&#8208;1 h&#8208;1, which was more than 5 times that of pure g&#8208;C3N4.</description>

                Electrocatalytic water splitting, which produces hydrogen and oxygen through water electrolysis, is a promising method for generating renewable, carbon-free alternative fuels. However, its widespread adoption is hindered by the high costs of Pt cathodes and IrO$_{x}$/RuO$_{x}$ anode catalysts. In the search for cost-effective alternatives, barium titanate (BaTiO$_{3}$) has emerged as a compelling candidate. This inexpensive, non-toxic perovskite oxide can be synthesized from earth-abundant precursors and has shown potential for catalyzing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in recent studies. In this work, we explore the OER activity of pristine and Ni-doped BaTiO$_{3}$ at explicit water interfaces using metadynamics (MetaD) simulations. To enable efficient and practical MetaD for OER, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential based on artificial neural networks (ANN), achieving large-scale and long-time simulations with near-DFT accuracy. Our simulations reveal that Ni-doping enhances the catalytic activity of BaTiO$_{3}$ for OER, consistent with experimental observations, while providing mechanistic insights into this enhancement.</description>

      <title>A high&#8208;entropy engineering on sustainable anionic redox Mn&#8208;based cathode with retardant stress for high&#8208;rate sodium&#8208;ion batteries</title>

                Manganese&#8208;based (Mn&#8208;based) layered oxides have emerged as competitive cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), primarily due to their high energy density, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and potential for mass production. However, these materials often suffer from irreversible oxygen redox reactions, significant phase transitions, and microcrack formation, which lead to considerable internal stress and degradation of electrochemical performance. This study introduces a high&#8208;entropy engineering strategy for P2&#8208;type Mn&#8208;based layered oxide cathodes (HE&#8208;NMCO), wherein a multi&#8208;ingredient cocktail effect strengthens the lattice framework by modulating the local environmental chemistry. This innovative approach fosters sustainable reversible oxygen activity, mitigates stress concentrations at grain boundaries, and accelerates Na&#8314; transport kinetics. The resulting robust lattice framework with optimized elemental interactions significantly improves structural integrity and reduces the formation of intragranular fractures. Consequently, HE&#8208;NMCO demonstrates remarkable cycling stability, retaining 93.5% capacity after 100 deep (de)sodiation cycles, alongside an enhanced rate capability of 134.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5C. Notably, comparative studies through multimodal characterization techniques highlight HE&#8208;NMCO's superior reversibility in oxygen anion redox (OAR) reactions over extensive cycling, contrasting sharply with conventional NMCO cathode. This work elucidates the potential for advancing high energy and power density Mn&#8208;based cathodes for SIBs through local species diversity.</description>

      <title>A 17.73% Solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen Efficiency with Durably Active Catalyst in Stable Photovoltaic&#8208;electrolysis Seawater System</title>

                Developing durably active catalysts to tackle harsh voltage polarization and seawater corrosion is pivotal for efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion, yet remains a challenge. We report a durably active catalyst of NiCr&#8208;layered double hydroxide (RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH) with highly exposed Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ru units, in which low&#8208;loading Ru (0.32 wt%) is locked precisely at defect lattice site (Rulds) by Ni and Cr. The Cr site electron equilibrium reservoir and Cl&#8208; repulsion by intercalated CO32&#8208; ensure the highly durable activity of Ni&#8208;O&#8208;Ru units. The RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH&#8214;RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH electrolyzer based on anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEM&#8208;WE) shows ultrastable seawater electrolysis at 1000 mA cm&#8208;2. Employing RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH both as anode and cathode, a photovoltaic&#8208;electrolysis seawater system achieves a 17.73% STH efficiency, corresponding photoelectricity&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (PVTH) efficiency is 72.37%. Further, we elucidate the dynamic evolutionary mechanism involving the interfacial water dissociation&#8208;oxidation, establishing the correlation between the dynamic behavior of interfacial water with the kinetics, activity of RuldsNiCr&#8208;LDH catalytic water electrolysis. Our work is a breakthrough step for achieving economically scalable production of green hydrogen.</description>

                The rational design of metal oxide catalysts with enhanced oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is crucial for the practical application of aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (a&#8208;r&#8208;ZABs). Precisely regulating the electronic environment of metal&#8208;oxygen (M&#8208;O) active species is critical yet challenging for improving their activity and stability toward OER and ORR. Herein, we propose an atomic&#8208;level bilateral regulation strategy by introducing atomically dispersed Ga for continuously tuning the electronic environment of Ru&#8208;O and Mn&#8208;O in the Ga/MnRuO2 catalyst. The Ga/MnRuO2 catalyst breaks the stability&#8208;activity restriction, showing remarkable bifunctional performance with a low potential gap (&#916;E) of 0.605 V and super durability with negligible performance degradation (300,000 ORR cycles or 30,000 OER cycles). The theoretical calculations revealed that the strong coupling electron interactions between Ga and Ru&#8208;O/Mn&#8208;O tuned the valence state distribution of the metal center, effectively modulating the adsorption behavior of *O/*OH, thus optimizing the reaction pathways and reducing the reaction barriers. The a&#8208;r&#8208;ZABs based on Ga/MnRuO2 catalysts exhibited excellent performance with a wide working temperature range of &#8208;20~60 &#176;C and a long lifetime of 2308 hours (i.e., 13,848 cycles) under a current density of 5 mA cm&#8208;2 at &#8208;20 &#176;C.</description>

      <title>Bimetallic Cooperativity of a Ferrocene&#8208;based Iridium NHC Complex in Water Oxidation Catalysis: A New Frontier for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/asia.202401357</link>

                Bimetallic catalysts have gained attention as promising contenders, owing to the synergistic interaction between two distinct metal centers. In this study, we present two N-heterocyclic carbene iridium(III) pentamethylcyclopentadienyl complexes [Cp*Ir(fcpyNHC)Cl]PF6 (1) and [Cp*Ir(pyNHC)Cl]PF6 (2) where 1 includes a ferrocene moiety acting as a bimetallic complex. Using ceric ammonium nitrate as a sacrificial oxidant, both complexes were tested for water oxidation. Complex 2 achieved a maximum turnover number (TONmax) of 3240 and a turnover frequency (TOFmax) of 231 min-1. In comparison, complex 1 demonstrated nearly double the activity with a TONmax of 6047 and TOFmax of 431 min-1 compared to 2, which was attributed to the cooperative effect of the catalyst in water oxidation reaction. This bimetallic Fe^Ir catalyst (1) exhibited outstanding catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution from water at ambient conditions. We identified a proposed FeIII^IrIV intermediate experimentally via UV-Vis spectroscopy and XPS study. Theoretically, this intermediate was more stable by 7.84 kcal/mol than the traditional FeII^IrV electromer intermediate. This delineates the pronounced bimetallic cooperative participation of both Fe and Ir metal centres for better activity.</description>

                Abstract The alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mainly encompasses four elementary reactions, involving intermediates such as HO*, O*, and HOO*. Balancing the Gibbs free energies of these intermediates at a single active site is a challenging task. In this work, a high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic framework incorporating Fe, Ni, Co, Cu, and Y metal elements is synthesized using an electrodeposition method, which then serves as a template for preparing a high&#8208;entropy phosphide/carbon (FeCoNiCuYP/C) composite. Notably, the obtained composite exhibits an amorphous structure with multiple catalytically active sites. Combined theoretical calculations and experimental measurements reveal the critical roles of Co/Ni and Fe atoms in tuning the electronic structure of FeCoNiCuYP and optimizing the binding strength of intermediates. Furthermore, Fe and Ni/Co sites prefer to stabilize the HO* and HOO* intermediates respectively, conducive to breaking their scaling relation of Gibbs free energy during OER. Owing to its fine&#8208;tuned composition and the synergistic effect of multiple active sites, the FeCoNiCuYP/C electrocatalyst demonstrates superior OER performance in alkaline solutions, requiring a mere 316 mV overpotential to yield 100 mA cm &#8722;2 current density with excellent stability. This work provides an innovative route to design efficient high&#8208;entropy electrocatalysts, holding significant promise for cutting&#8208;edge electrocatalytic applications.</description>

                Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis faces challenges associated with high overpotential and acidic environments, which pose significant hurdles in developing highly active and durable electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Ir-based nanomaterials are considered promising OER catalysts for PEM due to their favorable intrinsic activity and stability under acidic conditions. However, their high cost and limited availability pose significant limitations. Consequently, numerous studies have emerged aimed at reducing iridium content while maintaining high activity and durability. Furthermore, the research on the OER mechanism of Ir-based catalysts has garnered widespread attention due to differing views among researchers. The recent progress in balancing activity, durability, and low iridium content in Ir-based catalysts is summarized in this review, with a particular focus on the effects of catalyst morphology, heteroatom doping, substrate introduction, and novel structure development on catalyst performance from four perspectives. Additionally, the recent mechanistic studies on Ir-based OER catalysts is discussed, and both theoretical and experimental approaches is summarized to elucidate the Ir-based OER mechanism. Finally, the perspectives on the challenges and future developments of Ir-based OER catalysts is presented.</description>

                Abstract The key ongoing challenge is to design and develop effective and inexpensive oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts to replace Pt&#8208;based ones for commercial use in fuel cells. Owing to its abundance and tunable electronic properties, in the current work, the synthesis of highly dispersed mixed valent copper oxide electrocatalyst is reported. The EC exhibits a high mass activity of 9.8 mA mg &#8722;1 and a high current density of 5.3 mA cm &#8722;2 in contrast to the benchmark (20 wt%) Pt/C catalyst in a 0.1&#8208;M KOH solution for ORR. The significantly high electrochemical activity at the cathode is believed to be due to the presence of the Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox pair. Furthermore, the catalyst has been shown to be highly stable, maintaining a high current retention of 78% for up to 24 h. Furthermore, the engineered material is also active for the oxygen evolution reaction, making it a viable replacement for conventional Pt/C in alkaline fuel cells.</description>

                The combination of the electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) with the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction serves to reduce the anodic overpotential, thereby facilitating the efficient production of hydrogen. However, the GOR is confined to a narrow potential range due to the competition of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at high potential. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a catalyst with a high Faraday efficiency of formate (FE</description>

                Abstract The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are key processes in numerous oxygen&#8208;involved applications over a wide temperature range. Despite advances in nanofiber engineering to increase active site density and catalytic efficiency for ORR/OER, conventional electrode fabrication methods often compromise the integrity of nanofibrous structures. Herein, a robust strategy is presented for the fabrication of LaCo 0.6 Ni 0.4 O 3&#8208;&#948; (LCN) nanofibrous membranes using optimized electrospinning techniques. This approach achieves high specific surface area, increased porosity, rapid mass transport, and precise control of morphology and thickness. The resulting LCN nanofibers exhibit exceptional ORR and OER catalytic activity at room temperature, rivaling commercial Pt/C and RuO&#8322; catalysts. Moreover, in solid oxide cells (SOCs) operating at elevated temperatures, LCN nanofibrous membranes deliver remarkable ORR and OER performance, with a peak power density of 0.802 W cm &#8722; 2 at 700 &#176;C and excellent stability over 180 h. These results highlight the potential of nanofibrous perovskite catalysts for practical oxygen electrocatalytic applications and demonstrate that the LCN nanofibrous membrane, combined with a self&#8208;assembly approach, exploits on the advantages of high porosity and specific surface area. This work opens up new avenues for the use of nanofibrous electrodes in a wide temperature range.</description>

                Metal oxyhydroxides have been considered efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and structural flexibility has a significant role in boosting catalytic performance. However, structural control usually requires time-consuming and complicated synthesis stages. Here, a rapid one-step wet-chemical synthetic approach is reported to construct amorphous NiFeOOH nanosheets (a-NiFex NSs). This short-term, low-cost method can efficiently control the crystallinity of the materials. Interestingly, one can regulate the oxygen defect concentration and the metal valence by varying the Ni/Fe ratio. The high-valence metal species and oxygen vacancy in the amorphous structure facilitate the nucleophilic attack of OH&#8211;, activate lattice oxygen, and promote electrocatalytic performance. The optimized a-NiFe0.86 NS exhibits superior electrocatalytic performance with a low overpotential of 309 mV to achieve 100 mA cm&#8211;2 and high stability. This strategy provides a facile and universal approach to fabricating amorphous NiFe-based oxyhydroxides as highly efficient OER electrocatalysts.</description>

                The generation of hydrogen through water electrolysis represents a significant advancement in the transition towards low-carbon energy systems. Graphene-supported catalysts have demonstrated significant potential in improving the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) among several electrocatalysts utilised for this process. Nonetheless, attaining exact control over the morphology and electrical configuration of these catalysts continues to pose a considerable difficulty. This study presents the development of a highly effective electrocatalyst composed of graphene-supported NiFe LDH and PbO2, incorporating sulphur anions into the structure by a plasma jet treatment method. By optimising the ratio of sulphur anions, we were able to fine-tune the local coordination environment, which effectively adjusted the properties of the OH and OOH intermediates, thereby improving the OER catalytic performance. The plasma treatment introduced vacancy defects into the catalyst, further regulating its surface morphology and electronic structure. After sulphur anion optimisation, the graphene-supported catalyst exhibited excellent electrocatalytic performance in alkaline environments, achieving an OER overpotential of 228 mV at 100 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2. This performance, along with exceptional stability, exceeds the majority of previously documented catalysts. The results underscore the promise of sulphur anion optimisation and plasma treatment in improving OER performance, providing significant insights for the advancement of highly effective water-splitting catalysts.</description>

                Nickel-iron layered double hydroxide shows significant promise as an electrocatalyst in facilitating oxygen evolution reactions. But its development is hindered by low conductivity and insufficient cycling stability. Herein, the synthesis of a hierarchically structured heterostructure catalyst, CeO2@NiFe LDH, is reported through a straightforward two-step process involving hydrothermal treatment. The catalyst realizes a significant breakthrough in OER catalytic performance and stability. At a current density of 100 mA cm-2, the overpotentials amount to 255 mV in 1 M KOH, 263 mV in simulated seawater with alkaline conditions, and 346 mV in actual alkaline seawater. After 200 hours of continuous operation under high current density in simulated alkaline seawater, the morphology with no significant alterations observed, highlighting its high stability in complex seawater environments. Introducing CeO2 optimizes the binding energy of the OH intermediate, which facilitates the formation and dissociation of the OOH intermediate. In situ Raman analysis demonstrates the positive impact of CeO2 on the generation of active species. This research emphasizes the efficacy of CeO2 in improving the performance and durability of NiFe LDH for oxygen evolution reactions.</description>

                Abstract Development of high&#8208;performance and inexpensive electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at neutral pH is important for direct seawater splitting and organic electrosynthesis but remains challenging due to the sluggish OER kinetics and diverse side reactions inherent to the constituents of working electrolytes. Herein, we report on a P:NiFe electrode, containing P&#8208;doped NiFe alloy, as an excellent electrocatalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and OER pre&#8208;catalyst for efficient OER in both seawater and organic electrolyte for adiponitrile (ADN) electrosynthesis at neutral pH. Fe and P species modulate the coordination environment of nickel sites, which enables the simultaneous formation of OER&#8208;active nickel species and FePO x passivation layer, thus transforming HER&#8208;active P:NiFe to OER&#8208;active a &#8208;P:NiFe. Besides, the redox&#8208;dependent interconversion between HER&#8208;active P:NiFe and OER&#8208;active a &#8208;P:NiFe is fast and reversible. Finally, efficient and stable overall seawater&#8208;splitting and ADN electrosynthesis at an industrially relevant current density (100 mA cm &#8722;2 ) in pH&#8208;neutral media are also demonstrated.</description>

                Developing highly efficient non-iridium-based active sites for acidic water splitting is still a huge challenge. Herein, unique Ru&#8211;B&#8211;Cr moieties have been constructed in RuO2 nanofibers (NFs) to activate Ru sites for water electrolysis, which overcomes the bottleneck of RuO2-based catalysts usually possessing low activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and poor stability for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The fabricated Cr, B-doped RuO2 NFs exhibit low overpotentials of 205 and 379 mV for acidic HER and OER at 1 A cm&#8211;2 with outstanding stability lasting 1000 and 188 h, respectively. The assembled acidic electrolyzer also possesses great hydrogen production efficiency and durability at a high current density. Experimental and theoretical explorations reveal that the formation of Ru&#8211;B&#8211;Cr moieties effectively optimizes the atomic configurations and modulates the adsorption/desorption free energy of reaction intermediates to achieve exceptional HER and OER performance.</description>

      <title>Integrated Oxygen-Constraining Strategy for Ni-Rich Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.4c11901</link>
      <description>Miao Chang, Fangyuan Cheng, Wen Zhang, Mengyi Liao, Qing Li, Chun Fang, Jiantao Han, ACS Nano. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405777139

                Surface engineering is sought to stabilize nickel-rich layered oxide cathodes in high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries, which suffer from severe surface oxygen loss and rapid structure degradation, especially during deep delithiation at high voltages or high temperatures. Here, we propose a well-designed oxygen-constraining strategy to address the crisis of oxygen evolution. By integrating a La, Fe gradient diffusion layer and a LaFeO3 coating into the Ni-rich layered particles, along with incorporating an antioxidant binder into the electrodes, three progressive lines of defense are constructed: immobilizing the lattice oxygen at the subsurface, blocking the released oxygen at the interface, and capturing the residual singlet oxygen on the external surface. As a result, effective surface passivation, mitigated bulk and surface degradation, suppressed side reactions, and enhanced electrochemical performance are achieved, far beyond conventional single surface modification. The Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes with integrated oxygen-constraining modifications demonstrate impressive cycling stability in both half-cells and full cells, achieving stable long-term cycling even at a high cutoff voltage of 4.7 V and a high temperature of 45 &#176;C. This work provides a multilevel oxygen-constraining strategy, which can be extended to various layered oxide cathodes involving oxygen release challenges, providing an effective path for the development of high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries.</description>

                Abstract Oxygen electrochemistry, which encompasses the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), is of utmost importance in energy&#8208;related reactions such as zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZABs). However, due to their four&#8208;electron transfer process, these reactions are still significantly restricted by sluggish reaction kinetics. Supporting atomically&#8208;dispersed (AD) catalyst or metal nanoparticles (NPs) on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) is proven to be an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of oxygen electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the performance of these types of catalysts still fails to meet the critical requirements for ZABs. Herein, a novel Fe AD Co NPs @NC, which consists of both AD Fe&#8208;N 1 and Fe sites in the Co lattice, is developed. Spectroscopy studies and density functional theory calculations indicate that the Fe site in the Co lattice facilitates the conversion of Co NPs to an amorphous CoOOH, and the Fe&#8208;N 1 serves as the main active site for ORR. Fe AD Co NPs @NC demonstrates remarkable activity for both OER and ORR. When it is used as an air&#8208;electrode for ZABs, it demonstrates a power density of 247.49 mW cm &#8722;2 . This work presents a simple yet efficient method to enhance oxygen electrochemical performance through the synergy between AD sites and metal NPs.</description>

                Implementing a hydrogen economy on an industrial scale poses challenges, particularly in developing cost-effective and stable catalysts for water electrolysis. This study explores the catalytic potential of selenium nanoparticles (Se-NPs) synthesized via a simple chemical bath deposition method for electrochemical and photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting. The successful fabrication of Se-NPs on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) electrodes has been confirmed using a wide range of analytical tools like X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Importantly, electrochemical measurements revealed superior electrocatalytic activity of the modified Se-NPs/FTO electrodes, with low overpotential (220 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2) and Tafel slope (90.13 mV dec&#8211;1), indicating faster reaction kinetics and reduced energy inputs for oxygen evolution reaction. Furthermore, the Se-NPs/FTO electrode was employed for PEC water splitting in Na2S electrolyte, showing a notable enhancement in photocurrent density with a difference of 700 &#956;A cm&#8211;2 between light and dark conditions at 1.5 V vs RHE, demonstrating efficient light-driven hydrogen production. The overall findings of this work establish that the proposed Se-NPs/FTO electrodes are promising composites for both electrochemical and PEC performance, thereby providing insights into developing cost-effective catalysts for large-scale water splitting.</description>

      <title>Phase Engineering Facilitates O&#8211;O Coupling via Lattice Oxygen Mechanism for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution on Nickel&#8211;Iron Phosphide</title>

                Nickel&#8211;iron-based catalysts are recognized for their high efficiency in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) under alkaline conditions, yet the underlying mechanisms that drive their superior performance remain unclear. Herein, we revealed the molecular OER mechanism and the structure-intermediate-performance relationship of OER on a phosphorus-doped nickel&#8211;iron nanocatalyst (NiFeP). NiFeP exhibited exceptional activity and stability with an overpotential of only 210 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2 in 1 M KOH and a cell voltage of 1.68 V at 1 A cm&#8211;2 in anion exchange membrane water electrolyzers. The evolution of active sites and intermediates during OER on NiFeP was in situ probed and correlated using shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, complemented by differential electrochemical mass spectrometry and density functional theory. These results provide direct evidence that OER proceeds via the lattice oxygen-mediated mechanism. Remarkably, phosphorus doping plays a critical role in stabilizing the active &#946;-Ni(Fe)OOH phase, which facilitates the *OH deprotonation and the subsequent O&#8211;O coupling to form *OO intermediates. Our findings offer a deeper understanding of the OER mechanism, providing a clear pathway for designing next-generation OER catalysts with improved efficiency and durability.</description>

                CoFe-based catalysts have shown excellent activity for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), with the oxidation states of the active sites playing a crucial role in determining catalytic performance. However, how to effectively increase the oxidation state of these active sites remains a key challenge. In this work, a facile treatment with NaBH4 solution was employed to modulate the surface state of CoFeOxHy catalysts, inducing an enhanced OER activity. The overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for the NaBH4-treated CoFe catalyst was reduced to 270 mV, indicating improved OER activity. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results reveal that NaBH4 treatment induced a phase reconstruction of the CoFe oxalate framework, a critical step in enhancing its catalytic properties. The strong reducing ability of NaBH4 strengthened the Co-Fe interaction, allowing the retention of low-valence Co species while facilitating the formation of high-valence Fe sites. This dual modulation of Co and Fe oxidation states significantly accelerated charge transfer kinetics, ultimately boosting OER performance. These findings highlight the importance of improving the oxidation states of active sites in CoFe-based catalysts, providing insights for developing efficient catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.</description>

                RuO2 has been considered as a promising, low-cost, and highly efficient catalyst in the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, it suffers from poor stability due to the inevitable involvement of the lattice oxygen mechanism (LOM). Here, we construct a unique metallene-based core-skin structure and unveil that the OER pathway of atomic RuO2 skin can be regulated from the LOM to an adsorbate evolution mechanism by altering the core species from metallene oxides to metallenes. This switch is achieved without sacrificing the number of active sites, enabling Pd@RuO2 metallenes to exhibit outstanding acidic OER activity with a low overpotential of 189 mV at 10 mA cm&#8211;2, which is 54 mV lower than that of the counterpart PdO@RuO2 metallenes. Additionally, they also exhibit robust stability with negligible activity decay over 100 h at 50 mA cm&#8211;2, outperforming most reported RuO2-based catalysts. Multiple spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the Pd-metallene core, acting as an electron donor, increases the migration energy of subsurface oxygen atoms and optimizes the adsorption energy of intermediates on the active Ru sites, enabling a switch in the reaction mechanism. Such a unique metallene-based core-skin structure offers a novel way for tuning the catalytic behaviors of electrocatalysts.</description>

                We investigate the ultrafast electronic and thermal properties of the bulk amorphous cobalt oxide water oxidation catalysts cobalt-phosphate (CoPi) and cobalt borate (CoBi) using optical pump/X-ray probe correlated with in situ electrochemical transient absorption spectroscopy. The electronic signature of a light-generated intermediate species is compared to steady-state in situ heating X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), suggestive of non-thermal contributions to charge transfer formation on ultrafast timescales. With Co K-edge transient absorption spectroscopy, we observe a net photoreduction following 400 nm excitation that also initiates a potential-dependent increase in the excited-state fraction of trapped charge carriers that persists on nanosecond to microsecond timescales and is identified as a potential precursor state to oxygen evolving reactions (OER). Distinctly, the formation of excited-state species cannot be fully explained by photothermal reaction dynamics alone, with potential contributions from electronic motion acting in concert with macroscopic redox activity. The results can influence the design of water-splitting catalytic materials for tuning dimensionality, confinement, and charge delocalization across structures.</description>

      <title>Strong Heteroatomic Bond&#8208;Induced Confined Restructuring on Ir&#8208;Mn Intermetallics Enable Robust PEM Water Electrolyzers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.202420470</link>

                Low&#8208;iridium acid&#8208;stabilized electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the market deployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Manipulating the in situ reconstruction of Ir&#8208;based catalysts with favorable kinetics is highly desirable but remains elusive. Herein, we propose an atomic ordering strategy to modulate the dynamic surface restructuring of catalysts to break the activity/stability trade&#8208;off. Under working conditions, the strong heteroatom&#8208;bonded structure triggers rational surface&#8208;confined reconstruction to form self&#8208;stabilizing amorphous (oxy)hydroxides on the model Ir&#8208;Mn intermetallic (IMC). Combined in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the induced strong covalent Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Mn units in the catalytic layer weaken the formation barrier of OOH* and promote the preferential dynamic replenishment/conversion pathway of H2O molecules to suppress the uncontrollable participation of lattice oxygen (about 2.6 times lower than that of pure Ir). Thus, a PEM cell with Ir&#8208;Mn IMC as anode &#8220;pre&#8208;electrocatalyst&#8221; (0.24 mgIr cm&#8722;2) delivers an impressive performance (3.0 A cm&#8722;2@1.851 V@80 &#176;C) and runs stably at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 for more than 2,000 h with the cost of USD 0.98 per kg H2, further validating its promising application. This work highlights surface&#8208;confined evolution triggered by strong heteroatom bonds, providing insights into the design of catalysts involving surface reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Polyoxometalate for Enhanced OER Performance Using a Porous Manganese Oxide Support</title>

                The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical challenge in electrocatalytic water splitting, hindered by high energy demands and slow kinetics. Polyoxometalates (POMs), recognized for their unique redox capabilities, structural archetypes, and molecular precision, are promising candidates for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Yet, their application is hindered by high water solubility, causing rapid degradation and efficiency loss under harsh OER conditions. This study enhances the performance and stability of polyoxometalates (POMs) for OER by anchoring keggin&#8208;type POM [TiCoW11O40]7&#8208; nanosheets onto a conductive, carbon&#8208;protected manganese oxide (C&#8208;Mn2O3) nanospheres support. The acquired porous framework enhances POM/C&#8208;Mn2O3 (PCM) contact, improving stability, reaction kinetics, and redox activity by offering nucleation sites, electronic pathways, and abundant active sites, significantly boosting OER activity. The resulting PCM nanohybrid demonstrates remarkable OER activity in 1M KOH, requiring only a 300 mV overpotential to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm&#8208;2 with a Tafel slope of 88 mV/dec. The PCM electrocatalyst also shows high mass activity (784 A/g at 1.6 V) and maintains stability over 100 hours at 100 mA cm&#8208;2 without performance fatigue. Consequently, this study offers a viable strategy for developing efficient, durable electrocatalysts using low&#8208;cost materials.</description>

                Hydrogen production via water splitting is one of the latest low-cost green hydrogen production technologies. The challenge is to develop inexpensive and highly active catalysts. Herein, we present the preparation of electrocatalysts based on cobalt&#8211;phosphorus (Co-P) coatings with different P contents for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions (HER and OER). The Co-P coatings were deposited on the copper (Cu) surface using the economical and simple method of electroless metal deposition. The morphology, structure, and composition of the Co-P coatings deposited on the Cu surface were studied via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), while their activity for HER and OER in 1 M KOH was investigated using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chrono-techniques. It was found that the catalyst activity for both HER and OER depends on the P content of the catalyst and varies based on the highest efficiency for each reaction. The Co-P coating with 11 wt% P exhibited the lowest overpotential value of 98.9 mV for the HER to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 compared to the Co-P coatings with 8, 5, 1.6, and 0.4 wt% P (107.6, 165.9, 218.2, and 253.9 mV, respectively). In contrast, the lowest OER overpotential (378 mV) was observed for the Co-P coating with 8 wt% P to obtain a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 as compared to the Co-P coatings with 5, 11, 1.6, and 0.4 wt% P (400, 413, 434, and 434 mV, respectively). These results suggest that the obtained catalysts are suitable for HER and OER in alkaline media.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Effects in Electrocatalysis Studied with Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy: The Cases of Oxygen Reduction and Evolution Reactions on Cobalt Ferrite Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202402167</link>
      <description>Alfredo Giner-Requena, Jos&#233; Gracia, Teresa Lana&#8208;Villarreal, Roberto G&#243;mez, ChemSusChem. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405720879

                Recent years have witnessed an intense effort to unravel magnetic field effects in electrocatalysis, as they can enhance the performance of common electrocatalysts. Both experimental and theoretical studies have shown that magnetic fields may affect, among others, the macroscopic spin&#8208;orbital ordering, charge transport, bubble release, and electron transfer kinetics. This paper highlights Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) as a tool to analyze and separate the effects of magnetic field on both the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions at cobalt iron oxide electrodes. The unequivocal existence of magnetic field effects is demonstrated through EIS, which provides additional information useful to individuate the magnetic field effects. In the almost superparamagnetic nanoparticles studied here, while the magnetic field impact is positive for oxygen reduction, it turns out to be negligible in the case of oxygen evolution. In addition, this study reveals new significant insights, including the exceptionally slow relaxation kinetics of the magnetic effects and the significance of magnetic&#8208;induced surface modifications. The fact that the effects virtually disappear in the presence of electrolyte cesium ions points to the key role of electrode surface states. This study showcases the potential of EIS to probe the effects of permanent magnetic fields in electrocatalysis.</description>

                Nano&#8208;sized high&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) recently received more attention to researchers due to their superior electrochemical catalytic properties. HEMs comprise at least five elements with or without metals and are synthesized through solid&#8208;state reactions and solution&#8208;mediated techniques. The presence of many elements in these HEMs result in a high mixing entropy and facilitates the formation of stable solid solutions in fundamental crystal structures. Herein, Pt&#8208;free high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) were synthesized through facile and straightforward pulse microwave (PM) synthesis technique, which serve as efficient electrochemical catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction and oxygen reduction reaction. The PM synthesis method was conducted at an extremely low temperature (100 &#176;C) without any external catalytic reagents. Using this PM technique, Cr18.2Zr13.5Ti5.3Co17.8Ni8.4Cu8.5Fe28.3 and Al15.3Mn18.2Ti3.7Co23.2Ni5.9Cu5.9Fe27.8 HEAs catalysts were synthesized with superior catalytic activity towards OER and ORR and compare its activities with pure Pt catalysts. The as&#8208;prepared HEAs also display an anti&#8208;CO poisoning effect and long&#8208;term durability, as compared to pure Pt catalysts. The low&#8208;temperature PM approach not only confirms the feasibility of synthesis of noble metal&#8208;free HEAs but also validates their superior catalytic activity towards OER and ORR, which is beneficial for the development of proton exchange membrane fuel cells and proton exchange membrane water electrolysis.</description>

                Unbearable to the high catalytic potentials, most materials undergo either reversible or irreversible structural reconstruction during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis, involving valence changes as well as coordination alternation of both metal and oxygen active sites. Such potential-dependent evolution happening on the local surface brings about certain challenges but also necessity to explore in-situ structure-performance relations. However, corresponding researches prove intractable to reach a consensus due to universally undeveloped operando characterization techniques.</description>

                Spinel oxides are promising multifunctional electrocatalysts based on earth&#8208;abundant elements. While NiFe 2 O 4 and CoFe 2 O 4 have been widely studied for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), CuFe 2 O 4 has been less investigated. Herein, cubic CuFe 2 O 4 nanoparticles are synthetic using a microwave&#8208;assisted approach. The effect of post&#8208;synthetic calcination on particle morphology, crystal structure, and inherent properties such as optical bandgap, magnetic moment, or degree of inversion is investigated. The influence of the post&#8208;synthetic treatment on the electrochemical performance is then evaluated. It is found that higher calcination temperatures are beneficial for the OER, the hydrogen evolution reaction, and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which can be explained by an improved crystallinity, removal of organic surface residues and changes in the dominant crystal phase&#8212;and relatedly the conductivity. Especially for the ORR activity, an increase in the electrochemical active surface area and a decrease in the charge transfer resistance upon calcination are important prerequisites. The activity of CuFe 2 O 4 for the reduction of CO 2 to CO, in contrast, is mainly determined by the local environment of Cu 2+ and is best at a comparatively high degree of inversion and low amounts of organic residues and for particles with a cubic structure.</description>

                The research and improvement of electrocatalysts are crucial for lowering the energy barrier of water-splitting electrocatalytic reactions and enhancing reaction kinetics. To achieve this, the development of low-cost, high-performance electrocatalysts with broad application potential is urgent. In this study, The ZnCo 2 O 4 @Co 3 O 4 hybrid-structure nanowires were successfully synthesized using a hydrothermal method. As electrocatalysts for water splitting, ZnCo 2 O 4 @Co 3 O 4 achieves a current density of 20 mA cm &#8722;2 with an overpotential of 388.6 mV for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and an overpotential of 92.4 mV for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), demonstrating superior catalytic performance compared to single ZnCo 2 O 4 or Co 3 O 4 . Additionally, the ZnCo 2 O 4 @Co 3 O 4 sample exhibits a cell voltage of 1.747 V and maintains excellent stability in tests lasting over 25 hours.</description>

                Microsensors for resolving local pH are versatile analytical tools for studying reactions at solid-liquid interfaces in applications such as electrocatalysis and corrosion. However, the achievable temporal resolution is limited, hindering the operando investigation of local pH at surfaces in electrochemical reactions. Here, we present a methodology to achieve a high time resolution by deploying AC voltammetry with a pH microsensor. The sensor is composed of a gold ultramicroelectrode functionalized with electropolymerized methylene blue at its tip, allowing for continuous monitoring of pH in aqueous solutions in the neutral and acidic regime at a subsecond time resolution. As a proof-of-principle, we show that our sensors can be used for detecting interfacial pH at an electrified platinum nanoparticle-modified carbon electrode during the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions. The fast pH sensing capability is expected to open an avenue for routine operando studies of local pH at electrified interfaces.</description>

                Abstract Oxygen electrocatalysis plays a pivotal role in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries, which hold immense potential for energy conversion and storage systems due to their superior theoretical energy density, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and safety profile. However, carbon&#8208;based materials in air electrode face challenges stemming from the harsh oxidative environment of oxygen catalysis, leading to thermodynamic instability. This underscores the urgent necessity for the development of effective carbon anti&#8208;oxidation strategies. This comprehensive review initially explores the complex mechanisms underlying the oxygen reduction/oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER) and the prevalent issue of carbon corrosion in carbon&#8208;based materials. It then delves into diverse strategies aimed at mitigating catalyst corrosion through doped carbons, encompassing techniques such as graphitization, active site management, surface modification using functional groups, and corrosion resistance coating. Moreover, the review discusses methods to counteract carbon oxidation in catalyst supports, including the utilization of novel carbons, highly active catalysts to minimize oxidation, and the exploration of non&#8208;carbon alternatives. Furthermore, the review also sheds light on protecting current collectors and conductive additives within the air electrode from corrosion. Ultimately, it outlines emerging challenges and opportunities for addressing carbon oxidation in air electrode, paving the way for enhanced performance and longevity in fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries.</description>

      <title>Strong Heteroatomic Bond&#8208;Induced Confined Restructuring on Ir&#8208;Mn Intermetallics Enable Robust PEM Water Electrolyzers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/ange.202420470</link>

                Low&#8208;iridium acid&#8208;stabilized electrocatalysts for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) are crucial for the market deployment of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Manipulating the in situ reconstruction of Ir&#8208;based catalysts with favorable kinetics is highly desirable but remains elusive. Herein, we propose an atomic ordering strategy to modulate the dynamic surface restructuring of catalysts to break the activity/stability trade&#8208;off. Under working conditions, the strong heteroatom&#8208;bonded structure triggers rational surface&#8208;confined reconstruction to form self&#8208;stabilizing amorphous (oxy)hydroxides on the model Ir&#8208;Mn intermetallic (IMC). Combined in&#8208;situ/ex&#8208;situ characterizations and theoretical analysis demonstrate that the induced strong covalent Ir&#8208;O&#8208;Mn units in the catalytic layer weaken the formation barrier of OOH* and promote the preferential dynamic replenishment/conversion pathway of H2O molecules to suppress the uncontrollable participation of lattice oxygen (about 2.6 times lower than that of pure Ir). Thus, a PEM cell with Ir&#8208;Mn IMC as anode &#8220;pre&#8208;electrocatalyst&#8221; (0.24 mgIr cm&#8722;2) delivers an impressive performance (3.0 A cm&#8722;2@1.851 V@80 &#176;C) and runs stably at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 for more than 2,000 h with the cost of USD 0.98 per kg H2, further validating its promising application. This work highlights surface&#8208;confined evolution triggered by strong heteroatom bonds, providing insights into the design of catalysts involving surface reconstruction.</description>

                Abstract Transition metal hydroxides (TMHs), comprising metal-centered polyhedra, are abundant in nature and have a broad range of applications. Although the intercalation/deintercalation of polyhedra with unconventional coordination number (UCN) plays a pivotal role in their formation process and influences their chemical behavior, the detailed mechanism remains obscure. Here, by combining kinetically controlled growth of Co(OH)2 as a model system (where polyhedra with UCN refer to 4-coordinated tetrahedra), in situ pH measurement, and in situ ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, we tracked Co2+ tetrahedral intercalation/deintercalation with varying OH&#8722; concentration, discovering that the initial Co2+ tetrahedral intercalation into the Co(OH)2 lattice is inevitable and its retention is influenced by the effective OH&#8722; concentration, challenging previous beliefs about the formation of Co(OH)2 and potentially other hydroxides. More importantly, understanding the intercalation mechanism significantly contributes to optimizing the synthesis conditions of hydroxides with tunable coordination environments, which hold significant application potential, as evidenced by a proof of concept application in the oxygen evolution reaction.</description>

                This study explores the influence of Fe ion incorporation on the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media, utilizing CuO-based materials. Instead of developing an efficient and stable OER catalyst, this research investigates two distinct CuO variants: one with Fe ions adhered to the surface and another with Fe ions integrated into the CuO lattice. By employing a variety of analytical techniques, the study demonstrates that the CuO variant with surface-bound Fe ions (referred to as compound 1) exhibits significantly enhanced OER performance compared to the variant with internally embedded Fe ions (referred to as compound 2). The Tafel plots obtained from multistep amperometry profiles for compounds 1 and 2, as well as pure CuO and FeO(OH), exhibit linear relationships in the log(j) vs overpotential plot, with Tafel slopes of 39.3, 41.5, 115.9, and 121.9 mV/decade, respectively. These Tafel slopes indicate that compounds 1 and 2 likely share a similar reaction mechanism, whereas CuO and FeO(OH) appear to follow distinct mechanisms. At 570 mV overpotential, the turnover frequencies of Fe ions for compounds 1 and 2, as well as for FeO(OH), calculated from electrode compositions and chronoamperometry data, are found to be 1.1, 0.2, and 5.7 &#215; 10</description>

                The electrochemical reduction reaction of CO2 (CO2eRR) to high value-added chemicals in an aqueous electrolyte usually faces challenges, including sluggish oxygen evolution at the anode and the competing reaction of hydrogen evolution at the cathode. A novel CoNi@NC composite with high saturation magnetization, prepared by facile pyrolysis, was used as the cathode and a Pt sheet as the anode in an ionic liquid (IL)-methanol electrolyte to conduct the CO2eRR to produce CH4 and CO, and oxidation of methanol to generate methylal (dimethoxymethane, DMM). A magnetic CoNi alloy nanomaterial (CoNi@NC) with a nitrogen-doped carbon layer-coated structure was synthesized by a one-pot method. The system achieved an associative strategy for synchronous production of high-valued chemicals via two half-reactions at the cathode and anode, respectively. The optimal CoNi@NC composite exhibited efficient catalytic activity, obtaining an average of 54.5% faradaic efficiency (FE) for DMM within 48 h and 91.9% of momentary FE for CO and CH4 at 24 h under lower energy consumption. The electrode catalyst and ionic liquid electrolyte also exhibited good recyclability and stability in the CO2eRR. Mechanism studies indicated that magnetic CoNi alloy species served as adsorption and active sites for CO2 conversion. In addition, the carbon layer coating enhanced the stability of the CoNi alloy, and N-doping introduced surface defects on the carbon layer, thereby promoting CO2 adsorption and electrocatalytic activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrated that the magnetic CoNi (1 1 1) species was conducive to CO2 adsorption and activation, exhibiting high selectivity for the CO2eRR.</description>

                Rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries (ZAB) are a promising energy storage solution due to their low cost, low toxicity and high theoretical energy density. However, conventional alkaline ZABs face challenges such as CO2 absorption, zinc corrosion, and poor cycle stability. To address these issues, non&#8208;alkaline near&#8208;neutral electrolytes offer potential benefits, but they also present slower kinetics, especially during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) at the cell charge. This study investigates the use of atomic layer deposition (ALD) to introduce Ru&#8208;based Nano&#8208;sites onto carbon cathodes to enhance catalytic activity in non&#8208;alkaline ZABs. The catalytic performance of these ALD&#8208;treated materials was evaluated in ZABs with 1M Zn(OAc)2 and 1M ZnSO4 electrolytes. ALD&#8208;treated Ru catalysts significantly lower the OER overpotentials, improving charging capacity and stability of the battery compared to pristine carbon and benchmark RuO2/C samples with a similar content of ruthenium. We also find that with the Ru&#8208;based catalyst, OER proceeds exclusively through the four&#8208;electron pathway, in contrast to a mixture of two&#8208; and four&#8208;electron mechanisms observed for the pristine carbon. Our findings show, using a model catalytical system, that non&#8208;alkaline based ZABs can be realized through cathode engineering, and that the reaction mechanism on the cathode is highly dependent on its catalytic properties.</description>

                Developing low-cost and highly active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts using earth-abundant elements through simple and efficient synthesis methods holds paramount importance for sustainable hydrogen production via water electrolysis. Porous catalyst materials have proven versatile in heterogeneous catalysis due to their high surface area and fast mass diffusion. Herein, we developed a simple and sustainable approach for synthesizing high-surface-area, porous Co3O4 nanomaterials from perovskite materials, i.e., SrCoO3 and LaCoO3. The resulting porous Co3O4 nanomaterials exhibit exceptional efficiency in the water oxidation reaction. Notably, the acid-treated sample (AT-SCO-1M) demonstrated superior photochemical and electrochemical activities. It exhibits a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 8.13 &#215; 10&#8211;3 s&#8211;1, along with a lower overpotential (375 mV) and Tafel slope (117 mV/dec) compared to the untreated Cg-Co3O4 nanoparticles (4.28 &#215; 10&#8211;3 s&#8211;1, 465 mV, and 220 mV/dec). This method's selective removal of A-site cations from the perovskite precursors increases the catalyst surface area, porosity, and hydrophilicity, all collectively contributing to improved water oxidation activity. Our sustainable approach for synthesizing high-surface-area, porous nanomaterials through a simple, environmental, and recyclable method shows a new way to design highly active water oxidation catalysts and other catalytic applications.</description>

      <title>Mediating Self&#8208;Oxidation and Competitive Adsorption for Achieving High&#8208;Selective Urea Oxidation Catalysis at Industrial&#8208;Level Current Densities</title>

                Abstract Inhibiting the deactivation of nickel&#8208;based catalysts caused by self&#8208;oxidation and competitive adsorption behavior is still a major challenge for urea oxidation reaction (UOR), especially under industrial&#8208;level current densities. In this study, a crystalline NiSe 2 /amorphous NiFe&#8208;LDH (NiSe 2 /NiFe&#8208;LDH) heterojunction catalyst is rationally constructed for selective electrocatalytic UOR. In situ Raman spectra and ex situ characterization results reveal that such a structure can tailor the self&#8208;oxidation of catalyst and impede the accumulation of NiOOH species during the UOR process. Density function theory simulations disclose that the self&#8208;driven charge transport from electron&#8208;deficient NiFe&#8208;LDH region to electron&#8208;rich NiSe 2 region would induce the formation of local electrophilic/nucleophilic region to adsorb the electron&#8208;donating &#8208;NH 2 and electron&#8208;withdrawing C = O groups, respectively. This optimizes the adsorption of urea molecules and hinders the overaccumulation of OH &#8722; ions on the surface of NiSe 2 /NiFe&#8208;LDH, which is beneficial for the priority occurrence of UOR over the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the realization of high UOR selectivity. Benefiting from the tailored surface self&#8208;oxidation and favorable urea adsorption, the NiSe 2 /NiFe&#8208;LDH could act as a high&#8208;selective UOR anode and achieve ultrahigh 800 mAcm &#8722;2 only at 1.447 V. Besides, UV&#8211;vis spectrophotometry also unveiled that the NiSe 2 /NiFe&#8208;LDH has the capability to electrochemically degrade urea, offering great promise for practical application potentials.</description>

                The development of bifunctional electrocatalysts using renewable electricity for sustainable green energy industrial production is a potential method. As a result, numerous standard methodologies investigate developing electrocatalysts that naturally alter the electronic structure and minimize kinetic barriers. This study developed a promising method for engineering interfacial heterostructure nanoframes (Co2P/FeP-FeP4, hereafter denoted as CFP-8) deposited on nickel foam using hydrothermal and low-temperature phosphorization techniques. However, the improved CFP-8 electrocatalyst was exposed to abundant active sites and nanocrystals that remained intact. Importantly, P incorporation plays a crucial role in creating a P vacancy defect, which contributes to the thermodynamic favoring of the electrocatalysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and intrinsically enhances the hydrogen adsorption-free energy in hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs), due to the interconnected arrangement of CFP-8 nanoframes via the synergistic and strain-induced effect. Therefore, enclosed CFP-8 nanoframes demonstrate good performance and display low overpotential with high current densities (HER, &#951;10 = 97 mV, &#951;20 = 131 mV, &#951;50 = 186 mV; OER, &#951;10 = 230 mV, &#951;20 = 247 mV, &#951;50 = 280 mV) with a minimal Tafel value of &#951;10 = 111 mV/dec and &#951;10 = 74 mV/dec for HER and OER under alkaline medium, superior to benchmark electrocatalysts. Also, CFP-8 demonstrated remarkable stability over 50 h, utilizing chronoamperometry (CA) and chronopotentiometry (CP). In addition, an integrated electrolyzer using CFP-8/NF electrodes (polymeric binder-free electrodes) delivered a cell voltage of 1.65 V with a current density of 20 mA cm&#8211;2 with accelerated kinetics and improved stability, outperforming Pt/C (cathode)||RuO2 (anode) for overall water splitting reactions (OWSRs). The coexistence of Co, Fe, and P elements may accelerate electron and mass movement, improving the high current density electrocatalytic performance. This method paves the way for further research into low-cost transition metal-based phosphides for bifunctional energy applications.</description>

      <title>Coupling of Oxygen Dimer and Trapped O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with Strong Magnetic Frustration in Layered Li-rich Cathodes</title>

                Anion redox in layered Li-rich cathodes provides a high capacity but triggers a series of cascading issues. Current research predominantly focuses on how oxygen species participate in redox and how transition metals move, often ignoring the influence of magnetic frustration. This work systematically investigates the potential link between the evolution of magnetic frustration, structural evolution and oxygen redox in honeycomb Li2RuO3. Our findings indicate that the phase transition from C2/c to R3 exacerbates the magnetic frustration during Ru oxidation. Subsequently, during oxygen oxidation, the strong magnetic frustration drives the generation of (O2)n&#8722; and trapped O2, which serves to relieve and eventually eliminate the magnetic frustration. This (O2)n&#8722;/O2 formation mechanism, termed "magnetic-frustration-driven mechanism", provides a plausible explanation for the formation of trapped O2 in the systems with strong covalent TM&#8211;O bonds. Accordingly, we emphasize that improvement strategies should not only enhance the covalent TM&#8211;O bonds but also relieve strong magnetic frustration.</description>

                The development of high-performance bifunctional single-atom catalysts for use in applications, such as zinc-air batteries, is greatly impeded by mild oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER). Herein, we report a bifunctional oxygen electrocatalyst designed to overcome these limitations.

                Abstract The efficient production of useful substances in plant factories is very attractive to secure the nutrition for human health in the future. The aim of this study was to investigate the growth behavior of rice sprouts to establish a high&#8208;density production system for plant factories. To clarify the material balance during the growth of sprout of brown rice, a single individual of rice was cultivated in vitro. The weight of the sample and the oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations in the test tube were measured, with bioactivity indices being calculated. The contribution of growth respiration was confirmed based on the growth, oxygen uptake, and carbon dioxide evolution rates. The specific growth rates and oxygen concentrations all increased during the 60&#8208; to 80&#8208;h period. The decrease in the specific oxygen uptake rate and carbon dioxide evaluation rate generally corresponded to the 90&#8208; to 160&#8208;h period. These results suggest that the physiological state of rice sprouts can be evaluated using bioactivity indices obtained from individual cultivation systems. A trial application for the high&#8208;density heterotrophic cultivation of rice sprouts was performed using the developed container. The growth productivity of rice sprouts cultivated in containers was similar to that of individual test tubes. These results showed the new value of crop cultivation by the plant factory.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary oxidation behavior of W-Zr thin-film metallic glasses: A
  route for tailoring functional properties of W-Zr-O films</title>

                The oxidation behavior of W-Zr thin-film metallic glasses (TFMGs) with 32, 48 and 61 at.% Zr, prepared by dc magnetron co-sputtering, was comprehensively studied after annealing in synthetic air. The study focuses on the effect of the annealing temperature (up to 600{\deg}C) on the oxidation process, oxygen saturation, structure evolution, and their subsequent impact on electrical, optical and mechanical properties. The findings reveal that controlled oxidation transforms W-Zr TFMGs into amorphous ceramic W-Zr-O films with substoichiometric compositions. This is a consequence of an oxidation process that does not proceed through the formation of a stoichiometric oxide layer on the surface of W-Zr TFMGs, acting as a diffusion barrier against fast oxidation, but leads to a gradual incorporation of oxygen across the film volume due to thermodynamics factors. Higher Zr content accelerates the oxygen incorporation and its depth uniformity in the films. As a result, the mechanical properties are significantly enhanced achieving hardness values of up to 17.5 GPa at approximately 50% oxygen saturation. Simultaneously, the electrical and optical properties are finely tuned with the resistivity and the extinction coefficient (measured at 550 nm) ranging from 1.7 to 95.7x10-4 Ohm.cm and 0.28 to 1.06, respectively.</description>

                Atomic oxygen, due to its unique chemical properties, is widely used in astrophysics to study chemical composition, nucleosynthesis conditions, and the processes of formation and evolution. The recent detection of the O I 1304 &#197; and 7774 &#197; lines in the upper atmospheres of exoplanets using space and ground-based telescopes opens the possibility to evaluate its abundance in these objects and constrain important atmospheric parameters. However, the simple approximation of thermodynamic equilibrium is often inaccurate in describing the formation and absorption for many spectral lines in stars and hot exoplanets. The development of a kinetic model that takes into account detailed radiative and collisional processes in advanced atomic models is required to interpret the observations. In this work we for the first time analyze the advantages of transit absorption measurement of two oxygen lines simultaneously.</description>

                Abstract From a spectroscopic survey of candidate H ii regions in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) with MMT/Hectospec, we have identified 294 H ii regions using emission line ratios and calculated elemental abundances from strong-line diagnostics (values ranging from sub-solar to super-solar) producing both Oxygen and Nitrogen radial abundance gradients. The Oxygen gradient is relatively flat, while the Nitrogen gradient is significantly steeper, indicating a higher N/O ratio in M31&#8217;s inner regions, consistent with recent simulations of galaxy chemical evolution. No strong evidence was found of systematic galaxy-scale trends beyond the radial gradient. After subtracting the radial gradient from abundance values, we find an apparently stochastic and statistically significant scatter of standard deviation 0.06 dex, which exceeds measurement uncertainties. One explanation includes a possible collision with M32 200 - 800 Myrs ago. Using the two-point correlation function of the Oxygen abundance, we find that, similar to other spiral galaxies, M31 is well-mixed on sub-kpc scales but less so on larger (kpc) scales, which could be a result of an exponential decrease in mixing speed with spatial scale, and the aforementioned recent merger. Finally, the MMT spectroscopy is complemented by a dust continuum and CO survey of individual Giant Molecular Clouds, conducted with the Submillimeter Array. By combining the MMT and SMA observations, we obtain a unique direct test of the Oxygen abundance dependence of the &#945;&#8242;(12CO) factor which is crucial to convert CO emission to dust mass. Our results suggest that within our sample there is no trend of the &#945;&#8242;(12CO) with Oxygen abundance.</description>

      <title>A NIRS-Based Technique for Monitoring Brain Tissue Oxygenation in Stroke Patients</title>

                Stroke is a global health issue caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, which leads to severe motor disabilities. Measuring oxygen levels in the brain tissue is crucial for understanding the severity and evolution of stroke. While CT or fMRI scans are preferred for confirming a stroke due to their high sensitivity, Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)-based systems could be an alternative for monitoring stroke evolution. This study explores the potential of fNIRS signals to assess brain tissue in chronic stroke patients along with rehabilitation therapy. To study the feasibility of this proposal, ten healthy subjects and three stroke patients participated. For signal acquisition, two NIRS sensors were placed on the forehead of the subjects, who were asked to remain in a resting state for 5 min, followed by a 30 s motor task for each hand, which consists of opening and closing the hand at a steady pace, with a 1 min rest period in between. Acomplete protocol for placing sensors and a signal processing algorithm are proposed. In healthy subjects, a measurable change in oxygen saturation was found, with statistically significant differences (females p = 0.016, males p = 0.005) between the resting-state and the hand movement conditions. This work showed the feasibility of the complete proposal, including the NIRS sensor, the placement, the tasks protocol, and signal processing, for monitoring the state of the brain tissue cerebral oxygenation in stroke patients undergoing rehabilitation therapy. Thus this is a non-invasive barin assessment test based on fNIRS with the potential to be implemented in non-controlled clinical environments.</description>

                The Magellanic Clouds (MCs) are excellent locations to study stellar dust emission and its contribution to galaxy evolution. Through spectral and photometric classification, MCs can serve as a unique environment for studying stellar evolution and galaxies enriched by dusty stellar point sources. We applied machine learning classifiers to spectroscopically labeled data from the Surveying the Agents of Galaxy Evolution (SAGE) project, which involved 12 multiwavelength filters and 618 stellar objects at the MCs. We classified stars into five categories: young stellar objects (YSOs), carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (CAGB) stars, oxygen-rich AGB (OAGB) stars, red supergiants (RSG), and post-AGB (PAGB) stars. Following this, we augmented the distribution of imbalanced classes using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Therefore, the Probabilistic Random Forest (PRF) classifier achieved the highest overall accuracy, reaching 89% based on the recall metric, in categorizing dusty stellar sources before and after data augmentation. In this study, SMOTE did not impact the classification accuracy for the CAGB, PAGB, and RSG categories but led to changes in the performance of the OAGB and YSO classes.</description>

      <title>Diverse Transient Chiral Dynamics in Evolutionary Distinct Photosynthetic Reaction Centers</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c01469</link>
      <description>Yanmei Yang, Zihui Liu, Fulu Zheng, Panpan Zhang, Hongxing He, Ajay Jha, Hong-Guang Duan, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405736006

                The evolution of photosynthetic reaction centers (RCs) from anoxygenic bacteria to higher-order oxygenic cynobacteria and plants highlights a remarkable journey of structural and functional diversification as an adaptation to environmental conditions. The role of chirality in these centers is important, influencing the arrangement and function of key molecules involved in photosynthesis. Investigating the role of chirality may provide a deeper understanding of photosynthesis and the evolutionary history of life on Earth. In this study, we explore chirality-related energy transfer in two evolutionarily distinct RCs: one from the anoxygenic purple sulfur bacterium Thermochromatium tepidum (BRC) and the other from the oxygenic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vulcanus (PSII RC), utilizing two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES). By employing circularly polarized laser pulses, we can extract transient chiral dynamics within these RCs, offering a detailed view of their chiral contribution to energy transfer processes. We also compute traditional 2DES and compare these results with spectra related to circular dichroism. Our findings indicate that two-dimensional circular dichroism spectroscopy effectively reveals chiral dynamics, emphasizing the structural symmetries of pigments and their interactions with associated proteins. Despite having similar pigment&#8211;protein architectures, the BRC and PSII RC exhibit significantly different chiral dynamics on an ultrafast time scale. In the BRC, the complex contributions of pigments such as BChM, BPhL, BCh, and PM to key excitonic states lead to more pronounced chiral features and dynamic behavior. In contrast, the PSII RC, although significantly influenced by ChlD1 and ChlD2, shows less complex chiral effects and more subdued chiral dynamics. Notably, the PSII RC demonstrates a faster decay of coherence to localized excitonic populations compared to the BRC, which may represent an adaptive mechanism to minimize oxidative stress in oxygenic photosystems. By examining and comparing the chiral excitonic interactions and dynamics of BRC and PSII RC, this study offers valuable insights into the mechanisms of photosynthetic complexes. These findings could contribute to understanding how the functional optimization of photosynthetic proteins in ultrafast time scales is linked to biological evolution.</description>

      <title>A molecular dynamics study of the local structure evolution with temperature in Gd-doped CeO2: Focus on the bond length</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0240023</link>

                Since the long-range structure of the Gd-doped system (Ce1&#8722;xGdxO2&#8722;x/2) remains in the fluorite structure in the x-range [0&#8211;0.3], it is of interest to study this system in the local range. Molecular dynamics simulations seem to be particularly suitable for this purpose. Among all the possible parameters used to describe the local order/disorder, we focus on the behavior of the bond lengths. Doping cations and oxygen vacancies are introduced inside the fluorite structure following two arrangements, the random (R) and the neighbor (N). We investigate the evolution of the bond lengths with the temperature and doping level and identify different trends depending on the bond type (cation&#8211;anion, cation&#8211;cation). The bond length thermal expansion can be drastically different from the long-range thermal expansion mainly for the bonds implying Gd3+ cation. The presence of C-type Gd2O3 clusters is discussed through the study of the double component of the Gd&#8211;Gd Radial Distribution Function. Comments are provided for evolution of distances beyond the first and second shells of the cations&#8217; environment. This study also demonstrates the impact of point defect distribution (R or N) on the evolution of the local structure, while maintaining the long-range fluorite structure.</description>

      <title>Magma Ocean Evolution at Arbitrary Redox State</title>

                Abstract Interactions between magma oceans and overlying atmospheres on young rocky planets leads to an evolving feedback of outgassing, greenhouse forcing, and mantle melt fraction. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the solidification of oxidized Earth&#8208;similar planets, but the diversity in mean density and irradiation observed in the low&#8208;mass exoplanet census motivate exploration of strongly varying geochemical scenarios. We aim to explore how variable redox properties alter the duration of magma ocean solidification, the equilibrium thermodynamic state, melt fraction of the mantle, and atmospheric composition. We develop a 1D coupled interior&#8208;atmosphere model that can simulate the time&#8208;evolution of lava planets. This is applied across a grid of fixed redox states, orbital separations, hydrogen endowments, and C/H ratios around a Sun&#8208;like star. The composition of these atmospheres is highly variable before and during solidification. The evolutionary path of an Earth&#8208;like planet at 1 AU ranges between permanent magma ocean states and solidification within 1 Myr. Recently solidified planets typically host &#8208; or &#8208;dominated atmospheres in the absence of escape. Orbital separation is the primary factor determining magma ocean evolution, followed by the total hydrogen endowment, mantle oxygen fugacity, and finally the planet's C/H ratio. Collisional absorption by induces a greenhouse effect which can prevent or stall magma ocean solidification. Through this effect, as well as the outgassing of other volatiles, geochemical properties exert significant control over the fate of magma oceans on rocky planets.</description>

                Four fundamental reactions are essential to harnessing energy from water sustainably: oxidation reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen reduction reaction (OER), hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR), and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This review summarizes the research advancements in the electrocatalytic reaction of metal nanoclusters for water splitting. It covers various types of nanoclusters, particularly those at the size level, that enhance these catalytic reactions. The synthesis of cluster-based catalysts and the elucidation of the structure-activity relationships and reaction mechanisms are discussed. Emphasis is placed on utilizing atomically precise cluster materials and the interplay between the carrier and cluster in water catalysis, especially for applying catalytic engineering principles (such as synergy, coordination, heterointerface, and lattice strain engineering) to understand structure-activity relationships and catalytic mechanisms for cluster-based catalysts. Finally, the field of cluster water catalysis is summarized and prospected. We believe that developing cluster-based catalysts with high activity, excellent stability, and high selectivity will significantly promote the development of renewable energy conversion reactions.</description>

      <title>Primary cilia as antennas for oxygen</title>

                Over the last few decades, the primary cilium, an inconspicuous cell organelle, has increasingly become the focus of current research. The primary cilium is a microtubule-based, non-motile, antenna-like structure that is present on almost all mammalian cells. The ciliary membrane incorporates a large number of receptor molecules, which further characterize this cellular organelle. These include receptors of the Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-, Wnt- or Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-signaling pathways. For this reason, as well as due to the fact that extracellular signaling molecules can bind to the ciliary membrane, primary cilia have been named &#8220;the antenna of the cell&#8221;. In addition to their signaling function, the association of ciliary dysfunctions with a variety of diseases, so-called ciliopathies, underscores the importance of this functional cellular structure. Recent studies have also implicated primary cilia in the adaptation to low&#8209;oxygen conditions, which are characteristic for ischemia, such as in stroke or myocardial infarction, or tumor entities. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of these multiple facets and to take a closer look at the evolution of an inconspicuous cell organelle to a major player in hypoxia.</description>

      <title>Study of the Influence of Thermal Annealing of Ga-Doped ZnO Thin Films on NO2 Sensing at ppb Level</title>

                In this paper, the sensitivity to sub-ppm NO2 concentration of 50 nm thick Ga-doped ZnO (GZO) films grown by RF magnetron sputtering is studied. The films were annealed under dry air for 4 h at either 500 &#176;C, 600 &#176;C, or 700 &#176;C. The increase in the annealing temperature leads to an improvement of the crystallinity while no significant evolution of the surface grain size is observed. The electrical resistance of the thin films was measured at 250 &#176;C under neutral argon atmosphere, humid air reference atmosphere, and reference atmosphere polluted by 100 ppb of NO2. An increase in sensitivity to NO2 is noted for samples annealed at 600 &#176;C, leading to a response RNO2/Rair of ~10 for 100 ppb of NO2. Finally, photoluminescence spectra are compared with their electrical resistance at 250 &#176;C under the various atmospheres to understand this phenomenon. It is proposed that the origin of the NO2 maximum sensitivity for films annealed at 600 &#176;C is the consequence of a specific annihilation of point defects resulting in an increase in the relative concentration of oxygen vacancies, which improves selectivity toward NO2.</description>

      <title>3.08 billion-year-old crustal differentiation constrained by Sn and O isotopes of detrital cassiterite</title>

                Formation of granite-hosted tin deposits reflects the differentiation and maturation of continental crust. While rare in Earth's early continental crust, the eastern Kaapvaal Craton in southern Africa may harbor the oldest known tin-bearing granites. Here we present a perspective of early continental evolution from the study of Archean detrital cassiterite from the volcano-sedimentary continental cover succession of the Dominion Group of the western Kaapvaal Craton. The cassiterites yield a concordia age of 3084.7 &#177; 2.3 million-year-old, representing the oldest detrital cassiterite ever found. They are enriched in hafnium, zirconium, niobium, and tantalum, depleted in tungsten, and have overall consistent &#948;18O values (mostly 3&#8210;5&#8240;) but heterogeneous &#948;122/118Sn values (&#8722;0.59 to 0.79&#8240;). They likely originated from erosion of peraluminous granites, forming immediate basement of the Dominion Group. The occurrence of ~3.08 billion-year-old detrital cassiterite suggests widespread tin mineralization in the granites, the intrusion of which led to stabilization of the Kaapvaal craton. A detrital cassiterite found in the Kaapvaal Craton, South Africa, implies widespread tin mineralization and stabilization of granitic cratons approximately 3.08 billion years ago, as shown by U-Pb geochronology, trace element and oxygen and tin isotopes.</description>

      <title>Genetic Warfare: The Plant Genome's Role in Fending Off Insect Invaders</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/arch.70021</link>
      <description>Aleena Alam, Sohail Abbas, Noman Waheed, Arzlan Abbas, Weibo Qin, Jingxuan Huang, Khalid Ali Khan, Hamed A. Ghramh, Jamin Ali, Ri-Zhao Chen, Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology. 117(4)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405826247

                ABSTRACT The plant defense against insects is multiple layers of interactions. They defend through direct defense and indirect defense. Direct defenses include both physical and chemical barriers that hinder insect growth, development, and reproduction. In contrast, indirect defenses do not affect insects directly but instead suppress them by releasing volatile compounds that attract the natural enemies of herbivores. Insects overcome plant defenses by deactivating biochemical defenses, suppressing defense signaling through effectors, and altering their behavior through chemical regulation. There is always a genetic war between plants and insects. In this genetic war, plant&#8211;insect co&#8208;evolution act as both weapons and messengers. Because plants always look for new strategies to avoid insects by developing adaptation. There are molecular processes that regulate the interaction between plants and insect. Here, we examine the genes and proteins involved in plant&#8211;insect interactions and explore how their discovery has shaped the current model of the plant genome's role. Plants detect damage&#8208;associated and herbivore&#8208;associated molecular patterns through receptors, which trigger early signaling pathways involving Ca 2+ , reactive oxygen species, and MAP kinases. The specific defense mechanisms are activated through gene signaling pathways, including phytohormones, secondary metabolites, and transcription factors. Expanding plant genome approaches to unexplored dimensions in fending off insects should be a future priority in order to develop management strategies.</description>

                Controlling trap depth is crucial to improve photocatalytic activity, but designing such crystal structures has been challenging. In this study, we discovered that in 2D materials like BiOCl and Bi4NbO8Cl, composed of interleaved [Bi2O2]2+ and Cl- slabs, the trap depth can be controlled by manipulating the slab stacking structure. In BiOCl, oxygen vacancies (VO) create deep electron traps, while chlorine vacancies (VCl) produce shallow traps. The depth is determined by the coordination around anion vacancies: VO forms strong &#963; bonds with Bi-6p dangling bonds below the conduction band minimum (CBM), while those around Cl are parallel, forming weak &#960;-bonding. The strong re-hybridization makes the trap depth deeper. In Bi4NbO8Cl, VCl also creates shallow traps, but VO does not produce deep traps although Bi-6p orbitals are also forming strong &#963; bonding. This difference is attributed to the difference of energy level of CBM. In both cases, CBM consists of Bi-6p orbitals extending into the Cl layers. However, these orbitals are isolated in BiOCl, but those in Bi4NbO8Cl are bonded with each other between neighboring [Bi2O2]2+ layers. This unique bonding-based CBM prevents the formation of deep electron traps, and significantly enhances H2 evolution activity by prolonging lifetime of highly reactive free electrons.</description>

      <title>Effect of pressurization on bubble dynamics of photoelectrochemical water splitting</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0237629</link>
      <description>Xinyi Luo, Qiang Xu, Tengfei Nie, Yonglu She, Liejin Guo, Physics of Fluids. 36(12)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405734653

                Energy consumption of hydrogen production significantly restricts the practical application of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting technology for hydrogen production, despite its vital role in addressing the energy crisis. The direct high-pressure hydrogen production technology holds promise for reducing production costs and streamlining the overall process. This paper delved into the study of bubble dynamic characteristics of PEC water splitting reaction under elevated pressure operations by coupling a photoelectrochemical system with a high-speed microscopic camera. The results prove that the bubble growth behaviors are pressure-dependent. Pressurization leads to the simultaneous evolution of multiple bubbles along with bubble slip and coalescence on the photoelectrode surface. And the bubble detachment diameter and growth period are significantly reduced, suggesting that increasing pressure is conducive to promoting bubble detachment. Analysis of the results of linear sweep voltammetry and Tafel slope shows that elevated pressure leads to more challenging bubble nucleation. Furthermore, the time coefficient and growth coefficient of the bubble growth stage are computed, revealing that the diffusion-controlled stage dominates the bubble growth process post-pressurization. A force balance model is constructed in the initial process of bubble rising, and it is found that the terminal rise velocity of bubbles decreases when pressure increases. The effect of pressure on gas density was considered to calculate the gas production rate by bubble volume and growth period, discovering that the proportion of gas products in the form of dissolved oxygen in the liquid increases significantly under high pressure.</description>

      <title>Producing type Ia supernovae from hybrid CONe white dwarfs with main-sequence binary companions at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001</title>

                Abstract The nature of progenitors of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and their explosion mechanism remain unclear. It has been suggested that SNe Ia may be resulted from thermonuclear explosions of hybrid carbon-oxygen-neon white dwarfs (CONe WDs) when they grow in mass to approach the Chandrasekhar mass limit by accreting matter from a binary main-sequence (MS) companion. In this work, we combine the results of detailed binary evolution calculations with population synthesis models to investigate the rates and delay times of SNe Ia in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001. For a constant star formation rate of 5 M &#8857; yr -1 , our calculations predict that the SN Ia rates in the CONe WD + MS channel at low metallicity of Z = 0.0001 is about 0.11-3.89 &#215; 10 -4 yr -1 . In addition, delay times in this channel cover a wide range of 0.05-2.5 Gyr. We further compare our results to those given by previous study for the CONe WD + MS channel with higher metallicity of Z = 0.02 to explore the influence of metallicity on the results. We find that these two metallicity environments give a slight difference in rates and delay times of SNe~Ia from the CONe WD + MS channel, although SNe Ia produced at low metallicity environment of Z = 0.0001 have relatively longer delay times.</description>

                We report on a series of SrMo1-xMnxO3-&#948; perovskite oxides designed as potential anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). These materials were synthesized using a citrate method, yielding scheelite-type precursors with nominal SrMo1-xMnxO4 compositions, which were further reduced to obtain the active perovskite oxides. Their structural evolution was examined through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD). These techniques provided insights into the crystallographic changes upon Mn doping, revealing key factors influencing ionic conductivity. Whereas the oxidized scheelite precursors are tetragonal, space group I41/a, the reduced perovskite specimens are cubic, space group Pm-3m, and show the conspicuous absence of oxygen vacancies, even at the highest temperature of 800&#186;C. The transport properties were analyzed through electrical conductivity measurements, exhibiting a metallic-like behavior. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and dilatometry give insights into the thermal stability and expansion behavior, essential for SOFC operation. Test single SOFC were built in an electrolyte-supported configuration, on LSGM pellets of 300m thickness, assessing the performance of the title materials as anodes. This work emphasizes the critical relationship between the crystal structure and its electrochemical behavior, providing a deeper understanding of how doping strategies can optimize fuel cell performance.</description>

                Abstract Recently, metal&#8208;based atomically thin materials (M&#8208;ATMs) have experienced rapid development due to their large specific surface areas, abundant electrochemically accessible sites, attractive surface chemistry, and strong in&#8208;plane chemical bonds. These characteristics make them highly desirable for energy&#8208;related conversion reactions. However, the insufficient active sites and slow reaction kinetics leading to unsatisfactory electrocatalytic performance limited their commercial application. To address these issues, defect engineering of M&#8208;ATMs has emerged to increase the active sites, modify the electronic structure, and enhance the catalytic reactivity and stability. This review provides a comprehensive summary of defect engineering strategies for M&#8208;ATM nanostructures, including vacancy creation, heteroatom doping, amorphous phase/grain boundary generation, and heterointerface construction. Introducing recent advancements in the application of M&#8208;ATMs in electrochemical small molecule conversion reactions (e.g., hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfur), which can contribute to a circular economy by recycling molecules like H 2 , O 2 , CO 2 , N 2 , and S. Furthermore, a crucial link between the reconstruction of atomic&#8208;level structure and catalytic activity via analyzing the dynamic evolution of M&#8208;ATMs during the reaction process is established. The review also outlines the challenges and prospects associated with M&#8208;ATM&#8208;based catalysts to inspire further research efforts in developing high&#8208;performance M&#8208;ATMs.</description>

                Abstract Ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) electrocatalysts are promising candidates for assembling high&#8208;performance anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) while their intrinsic activities are restricted due to the strong Ru&#9472;H bond strength. Herein, we present the synthesis and stabilization of electron&#8208;deficient Ru nanoclusters on oxygen&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotube (Ru/O&#8208;CNT) via strong electronic metal&#8208;support interaction (EMSI) toward highly efficient and stable alkaline HER. A scalable high&#8208;temperature shock method is used to anchor Ru nanoclusters on O&#8208;CNT, which suppresses the aggregation of Ru clusters and the loss of O anion during synthesis, thus strengthening the EMSI between the two components via Ru&#8211;O&#8211;C link. The strong EMSI helps to stabilize Ru at electron&#8208;deficient state at reductive potentials and optimizes the Ru&#9472;H bond strength. Consequently, Ru/O&#8208;CNT delivers outstanding performances for alkaline HER with a small overpotential of 10 mV at 10 mA cm &#8722;2 , which is superior to the benchmark Pt/C and most reported Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts. More impressively, an AEMWE assembled with Ru/O&#8208;CNT as cathode achieves high current densities of 1 and 5 A cm &#8722;2 at low cell voltages of 1.68 and 2.09 V, respectively, at a Ru mass loading of only 20 &#181;g cm &#8722;2 .</description>

                Manifestations of sulfuric acid speleogenesis (SAS) documented in several caves in the areas of Aghia Paraskevi, Konitsa, W. Peloponnese, Elassona, Lavrion and Kammena Vourla in Greece are examined and discussed in this work. Carbonate and sulfate samples collected from caves in Aghia Paraskevi and western Peloponnese areas were investigated using methods, such as fluid inclusion, scanning electron microscopy, carbon, sulfur and oxygen stable isotopes, X-ray powder diffraction, and chemical analysis. The examined caves are mainly developed at or in the proximity of the local water table and they are related to hydrothermal springs and geothermal fields. In addition to the documentation of SAS in one case study from Aghia Paraskevi, calcite spar with a homogenization temperature peak at 280&#176;C, indicates an early speleogenetic stage that involves meteoric-origin hydrothermal fluids under deep-seated settings. Sulfur isotope composition of sulfates (&#8211;4 &#8240;) is indicative for pyrite oxidation. The Konitsa caves represent a system developed at multiple altitudes that is related to the evolution of Sarantaporos River. The caves in West Peloponnese are located in two different geotectonic units. However, the caves in both units are active and share common characteristics, such as their development near sea level, morphology and fracture-guided pattern, and the presence of gypsum with &#948;34S values (average &#8211;26 &#8240;) that are plausibly related to hydrocarbons and bacterial activity. Morphological and geochemical aspects of the caves in these two regions suggest long-lasting, multiphase speleogenetic systems.</description>

      <title>Diagenesis and Reservoir Evolution of Low Permeability Sandstones: A Case Study of the Second Member of the Jurassic Sangonghe Formation, Central Junggar Basin, China</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1002/gj.5109</link>
      <description>Zheng Cao, Hairuo Qing, Karem Azmy, Lei Zhang, Zhipeng Li, Shijie Zhu, Changcheng Han, Qing Wei, Nanxin Yin, Geological Journal. None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405851920

                ABSTRACT The low&#8208;permeability oil&#8208;bearing tuffaceous sandstones of the second member of the lower Jurassic Sangonghe Formation (J 1 s 2 ) in the Well Pen&#8208;1 west sag of the central Junggar Basin occur in a deep burial setting (&gt; 4000 m). They contain abundant oil and gas shows and hold promising exploration prospects. However, the reservoir heterogeneity is strong due to complex lithofacies and diagenesis, leading to significant productivity differences between adjacent wells. Therefore, identifying the lithofacies and diagenesis of the J 1 s 2 sandstones and elucidating their influence on the evolution of relatively high&#8208;quality reservoirs is of utmost importance for oil and gas exploration and development in this area. Samples from the Well Pen&#8208;1 west sag, representing the J 1 s 2 sandstones, were investigated utilising core and thin section observations, scanning electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, fluid inclusions and carbon and oxygen isotope analyses. The J 1 s 2 sandstones are mainly medium&#8208; to fine&#8208;grained and moderate&#8208; to&#8208;well&#8208;sorted feldspathic litharenites and litharenites. The tuffaceous contents range from 2.6% to 25% and the authigenic clay contents, produced by diagenesis, range from 0.6% to 12%, although carbonate cements are not abundant (av. 3.1%). Four sandstone lithofacies have been identified based on mineral compositions, leading to variations in diagenetic evolution and reservoir quality. Early diagenetic events included compaction, alteration of tuffaceous matrix and feldspar, and development of smectite, chlorite, kaolinite and early calcite. Mesogenic alteration included feldspar and tuffaceous matrix dissolution, alteration of kaolinite, chlorite and illite, and precipitation of quartz, anhydrite, late calcite and ferrocalcite. The alteration of the tuffaceous matrix resulted in a complex pore&#8208;throat structure in the J 1 s 2 sandstones. The pebbly sandstone and conglomerate (SC) and fine&#8208;grained sandstone (Sm) lithofacies are generally characterised by high compaction resistance, low tuffaceous matrix and cement contents, and abundant secondary dissolution pores, and they exhibit better reservoir quality and great potential for oil and gas enrichment.</description>

                Abstract. Developing reliable methods for quantifying past temperature changes is essential for understanding Earth's climate evolution and predicting future climatic shifts. The degree of methylation of branched tetraethers (MBT&#8217;5ME), of branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), a group of bacterial membrane lipids, has become a widely accepted tool for lacustrine paleothermometry. To allow this, an empirical calibration was developed, based on MBT&#8217;5ME values of surface sediments across large spatial scales. As these sediments integrate variability across several years to decades, the sensitivity of MBT&#8217;5ME to seasonal and short-term environmental changes in the water column remains underexplored. Here, we present a record of brGDGTs in suspended particulate matter (SPM) from a monomictic, eutrophic temperate lake (Rotsee, Switzerland) over a 10-month period, examining both core lipids and intact polar lipids. Rotsee offers an ideal setting for this study due to its strong seasonal variations in temperature, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen caused by summer warming and associated stratification. In the oxic epilimnion, a minor increase in MBT'5ME during stratified summer months was caused by a rise in brGDGT Ia concentration. A similar increase in concentration of 6-methyl brGDGTs indicates a sensitivity to water temperature. In the seasonally anoxic hypolimnion, MBT'5ME correlated with water pH rather than temperature, suggesting that water chemistry influences this ratio, complicating its use as a temperature proxy. The production of intact polar lipid (IPL) tetraethers was observed exclusively in the anoxic hypolimnion during stratification, confirming anoxia as a key trigger for IPL tetraether production. Surface sediment samples along a depth gradient have a distinct depth-dependent distribution. Sediments below the oxic water column showed lower MBT'5ME values, likely due to the sedimentary production of brGDGTs IIa and IIIa. Sediments from seasonally anoxic areas reflected average epilimnion SPM values, suggesting the deposition of epilimnion brGDGTs into the sediments. This study of brGDGTs in Rotsee SPM and sediments thus indicates that temperature, pH and oxygen concentration impact GDGT distribution, with significant implications for using MBT'5ME as a temperature proxy in sediments from stratified lakes.</description>

                Abstract As the demand for cleaner energy becomes a paramount objective of sustainable development, the advancement of cutting&#8208;edge engineered materials for a wide range of applications becomes increasingly vital. Tailoring catalyst properties through precise design and electronic state tuning is essential for adapting these materials to large&#8208;scale energy applications. Given this, an effective electronic fine&#8208;tuning (EFT) strategy is presented to optimize the electronic structures of single&#8208;atom Zn site and Ru species, synergistically enhancing the both electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Benefiting from the interaction between Ru species anchored on hierarchically layered nanosheets and isolated Zn atoms (Ru@Zn&#8208;SAs/N&#8208;C), the catalyst exhibits superior ORR and HER activities compared to the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm a novel EFT effect between a single Zn site and Ru species, that enables the Ru@Zn&#8208;SAs/N&#8208;C approaches the optimal scaling relation between * OOH and * OH, breaking the universal ORR scaling limitation. Additionally, the optimal G H* value positions Ru@Zn&#8208;SAs/N&#8208;C near the apex of the theoretical HER volcano model. This work provides an innovative avenue for regulating the electronic localization of catalytic active centers by virtue of carbon substrate and offers valuable insights for designing high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Ongoing loss of viable neurons for weeks after mild perinatal hypoxia-ischemia</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.19.629457</link>
      <description>Melanie A. McNally, Lauren A. Lau, Simon Granak, David Hike, Xiaochen Liu, Xin Yu, Rachel Donahue, Lori B. Chibnik, J Ortiz, Alicia Che, Frances J. Northington, Kevin J. Staley, bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405711121

                Mild hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is common in neonates with no evidence-based therapies, and 30-40% of patients experience adverse outcomes. The nature and progression of mild injury is poorly understood. Thus, we studied the evolution of mild perinatal brain injury using longitudinal two-photon imaging of transgenic fluorescent proteins as a novel readout of neuronal viability and activity at cellular resolution. In vitro, perinatal murine organotypic hippocampal cultures underwent 15-20 minutes of oxygen-glucose deprivation. In vivo, mild hypoxia-ischemia was completed in post-natal day 10 mouse pups of both sexes with carotid ligation and 15 minutes of hypoxia. Consistent with a mild injury, minimal immediate neuronal death was seen and there was no volumetric evidence of injury by ex vivo MRI 2.5 weeks after injury. In both the hippocampus and neocortex, these mild injuries resulted in a significantly delayed and progressive neuronal loss in the second week after injury, measured by fluorophore quenching. Mild hypoxia-ischemia transiently suppressed cortical network activity followed by normal maturation. No post-injury seizures were seen. The participation in network activity of individual neurons destined to die was indistinguishable from those that survived for 4 days post-injury. In conclusion, our results showed that mild perinatal brain injury resulted in a prolonged increase of neuronal death. Neurons that died late were functioning normally for days after injury, suggesting a new pathophysiology of neuronal death. Critically, the neurons destined to die late demonstrated multiple biomarkers of viability long after mild injury, suggesting their later death may be modified with neuroprotective interventions.</description>

      <title>IL-1&#946; primed mesenchymal stromal cells moderate hemorrhagic shock-induced vascular permeability</title>

      <description>Nathalie Baudry, Aur&#233;lie Campeanu, Clotilde Aussel, Caroline Doutrelon, Marion Grosbot, S&#233;bastien Banzet, &#201;ric Vicaut, Juliette Peltzer, Journal of Translational Medicine. 22(1)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405731942

                Hemorrhagic shock (HS) corresponds to absolute hypovolemia creating an imbalance between oxygen supply and consumption. This causes an impaired hemostasis, a systemic inflammatory response, and microvascular permeability which can lead to multiple organ failure (MOF). There is no specific treatment for the endothelial dysfunction that plays a major role in the evolution towards MOF. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been used in clinical trials for their immunomodulation and tissue repair capabilities for many years. Moreover, we previously showed that IL-1&#946;-primed-MSC (MSCp) attenuated HS-induced organ injuries. The objective of the study was to determine whether MSCp could prevent the onset of MOF after HS by preventing endothelial dysfunction. We established a rat model of HS, inducing 90 min of HS at a fixed mean arterial pressure of 35 mmHg, followed by resuscitation and transfusion. MSCp treatment was administered intravenously at the onset of resuscitation. After 6 h, we assessed plasma levels of endothelial markers, vascular permeability using Evans Blue (EB) dye, and renal and hepatic water content by measuring the wet-to-dry weight difference. Additionally, we investigated the ability of MSCp to inhibit leukocyte adhesion to activated endothelium in vitro. Our results indicate that early administration of MSCp significantly reduced the percentage of water content and EB dye in the liver but not in the kidney. These results were associated with a trend toward decreased plasma levels of Syndecan-1, ICAM-1, vWF, and VCAM-1. In vitro, MSCp reduced leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion. Together, our results suggest that MSCp help to prevent endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage, which, in turn, could protect the liver from injury.</description>

      <title>Long-term adaptation to hypoxia provides insight into mechanisms facilitating the switch of&lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;to chronic lung infections</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.12.26.630387</link>
      <description>Joanna Drabinska, Lucy O&#8217;Connor, Niamh Duggan, Conn Carey, Siobh&#225;n McClean, bioRxiv (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). None(None)] 2024. https://openalex.org/W4405825044

                Opportunistic bacterial infections emerging from the environment are an increasing threat, especially for immunocompromised individuals such as people with cystic fibrosis (CF), driving morbidity, and mortality. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a key pathogen from this group associated with chronic lung infections that has been extensively studied in this context, but the mechanism driving its adaptation towards chronic colonisation in the CF lung is not fully understood. This work focuses on the adaptations of P. aeruginosa to long-term hypoxia, one of the important environmental pressures present in the CF lung, to investigate whether it drives the development of persistence in CF patients. We examined how an early CF isolate adapted to 6% oxygen over 28 days using an experimental evolution approach and showed that two distinct P. aeruginosa small colony variants (SCVs) emerged, one exclusively in hypoxia exposure cultures. Importantly, SCVs were more prevalent in hypoxia-adapted cultures than in normoxia-adapted cultures (98% vs &lt;35%). Proteomic analysis revealed significant changes in the abundance of &gt;200 proteins within 28 days, including proteins involved in antibiotic resistance, stress response, iron acquisition, biofilm formation and those previously associated with chronic infection. Importantly the observed changes in the proteome were distinct from changes reported after short-term exposure to hypoxia. Phenotypic characterisation of adapted cultures supported these findings, showing that hypoxia-adapted cultures developed higher resistance to 8 of 13 antibiotics tested; increased biofilm (1.8-4.1-fold (p&lt;0.0001) and decreased pyocyanin production (2.6-fold, p&lt;0.0001). All hypoxia-adapted cultures showed decreased siderophore production (2.9-3.6-fold, p&lt;0.02). Two distinct patterns of adaptation to hypoxic conditions were observed, with the phenotypes of one culture being markedly different from the other two. Overall, we demonstrate that long-term hypoxia exposure contributes to multiple phenotype and proteome changes that are also observed in P. aeruginosa CF lung chronic infection, possibly opening the path to treatment of chronic infections.</description>

These batteries offer enhanced safety, stability, and potential for high energy density, addressing limitations of conventional liquid-state designs, such as flammability and side reactions under operational conditions. This perspective reviews the latest advancements in solid-state Li-O2 batteries, focusing on performance metrics such as cycle life, areal capacity, and current density. Material selections from recent studies are examined. Key reporting practices, such as liquid content, operation temperature, availability of differential electrochemical mass spectrometry results, and reporting completeness on loading information are summarized. Additionally, relationships among various performance metrics are explored. Despite significant progress, solid-state Li-O2 batteries continue to face limitations with low current densities and limited cycle capacities, indicating that existing materials and designs have yet to fully exploit the technology's theoretical potential. This analysis highlights areas for future research, particularly in stability and interfacial engineering, to bridge the gap toward commercially viable, high-energy-density solid-state Li-O2 batteries. Download figure Download PowerPoint Introduction In recent years, the global push to reduce carbon emissions and transition to renewable energy sources has significantly boosted the demand for next-generation energy storage devices. As a critical component of these devices, battery technology has become central to meeting the increasing energy density requirements brought by advancements in electric vehicles (EVs), commercial aviation, locomotives, and portable electronics. The lithium-oxygen battery (LOB) is recognized for having the highest theoretical energy density among current battery technologies, capable of delivering a specific energy of up to 5.2 kWh/kg, far exceeding the energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries.1&#8211;3 A typical liquid-state LOB generally comprises a lithium metal anode, a separator, a porous cathode, and an electrolyte.4 In the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) during discharge, lithium atoms lose electrons on the anode and become Li+ ions, which are then transported to the cathode to react with O2 and electrons, forming lithium peroxide (Li2O2). In the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) during charging, Li2O2 decomposes into Li+ ions and O2; the Li+ ions then diffuse back to the anode, where they gain electrons to reform lithium metal. Liquid electrolytes facilitate faster Li+ ion transport and maintain excellent contact between active materials, enabling efficient electrochemical reactions. However, liquid-state LOBs are limited to electrolyte instability, parasitic reactions with oxygen, and safety concerns related to flammability, which hinder their long-term performance and reliability. Solid-state LOBs utilize solid electrolytes, which improve electrolyte stability, extend cycle life, and enhance potential energy density. Solid electrolytes are less flammable than liquid electrolytes, providing greater safety and stability by reducing degradation and minimizing undesirable side reactions with oxygen. Additionally, the compact design and lighter weight of the electrolyte in solid-state LOBs enable higher potential energy density. Solid-state electrolytes can also mitigate lithium dendrite formation and provide better compatibility with lithium metal anodes, both of which are essential for maximizing energy density.5,6 Though promising, several challenges restrict the energy density and practical applications of solid-state LOBs. These challenges include interfacial impedance between battery component layers, the stability of solid-state electrolytes when exposed to air, low ionic conductivity, compatibility and reactivity with lithium metal, and scalability of production processes.7&#8211;14 Researchers have attempted to address these challenges by exploring various materials for solid-state electrolyte (SSE), adding interlayers between electrodes, incorporating small amount of liquid electrolytes, and operating cells at temperatures above room temperature.15 Despite the growing diversity of material choices and significant improvements in cell performance, the path to achieving practical, high-energy-density solid-state LOBs remains distant. In this article, we will summarize recent research progress and trends, examine key reporting practices and experimental conditions, and explore the correlation among various performance metrics. All discussions are based on quantitative metrics extracted from a large majority of research papers published between 2009 and 2024 on solid-state/quasi solid-state/hybrid LOBs (totaling 48, collected data set can be found in Supporting Information spreadsheet).16&#8211;41 In this work, current density and specific capacity are consistently compared using the units of mA/cm2 and mAh/cm2, respectively. We find that while solid-state LOBs have made progress in material selections and performances, they remain limited by low current densities, cycle capacities, and interfacial stability issues. Inconsistent reporting practices, particularly on liquid content, operational conditions, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS)/titration data, and loading information hinder accurate comparisons across studies. Addressing these challenges and standardizing reporting are essential steps toward realizing the commercial potential of solid-state lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) batteries. Research Progress and Trends Cycle current density is a critical parameter for evaluating the rate capability and efficiency of solid-state LOBs. Figure 1a shows the reported cycle current densities over time, ranging from 2009 to 2024. The data indicates a diverse range of current densities explored in the range of 0.013&#8211;0.516 mA/cm2. A high proportion, 86.7%, of research works have primarily focused on low current densities, which are define as less than 0.3 mA/cm2. Only three studies reported current densities above 0.5 mA/cm2. However, the two of the studies used a specific amount of liquid electrolyte,25,30 while another study demonstrated its performance for only 10 cycles.17 In addition, there is no clear trend of increasing current densities over the years (Figure 1a), indicating that the cycle performance of solid-state LOBs is limited to low current densities. At higher current densities, the number of achievable cycles decreases significantly. Similarly, the reported cycle capacities are generally low, with 90.9% of reported values under 1 mAh/cm2 (Figure 1b). However, they were either incorporated with certain amounts of liquid electrolyte21,22,38 or operated at high temperatures.27 In fact, it appears that studies of recent years have clustered to an areal capacity range of 0.1&#8211;0.5 mAh/cm2, suggesting it has become a sort of standard practice to remain within these bounds for cycling. One of the possible reasons is that the electrochemical efficiencies of these cells are insufficient to support long-term cycling at high rates. It is known that Li2O2 titration and DEMS are effective approaches to examine the efficiency of OER and ORR. Unfortunately, our analysis indicates that Li2O2 titration and DEMS results are missing from many papers. This will be further discussed in a later section. Figure 1 | Research progress and trends. (a) Cycle current densities; (b) cycle capacity; (c) cycle number; and (d) throughput capacity over time, ranging from 2009 to 2024. Download figure Download PowerPoint Interestingly, we still observed a steady increase in cycle life over time for solid-state LOB (Figure 1c). Given the significant impact of the volume of liquid electrolyte on the performance of solid-state LOBs, it is important to point out that there are two clear groups of studies. Articles that incorporate high liquid (&gt;5 uL) and those that incorporate none to limited amounts (&gt;5 uL) of explicitly added electrolyte. When these two groups are separated (Figure 1c inset), the increasing trend in cycle life becomes arguably more pronounced. The magnitude of such trends proved to be deceiving. Unfortunately, upon a more detailed investigation, the upward trends in cycle life are very much amplified due to the decreasing trend in cycling capacity that used during long cycle tests. If we adopt a figure of metric for Li metal anodes, the throughput capacity,42,43 the cycling capacity is also taken into account by computing a total cycled capacity (areal capacity &#215; cycle number), and we can see that the grouping of the performance over the years becomes tighter with a significantly weaker upward trend. Specifically, solid-state LOBs could only operate for less than 132 cycles before 2019, while the cycle life of cells have been extensively improved in the recent years. Notably, the cycle life of a Li2O-based solid-state LOB44 and a cell with an integrated cathode/electrolyte structure45 has reached 1000 cycles. Both works focus on solving at least one of the essential challenges of solid-state LOBs. An LOB with Li2O as the main discharge product, produced through a four-electron process, can achieve significantly higher energy density compared to an LOB with Li2O2 as the main discharge product, which is formed through a two-electron process. More importantly, Li2O can be generated at a lower charge potential, reducing the formation of side products and minimizing SSE degradation, thereby extending cycle life. Meanwhile, the integrated cathode and electrolyte was proven to be an effective approach to mitigating the high interfacial impedance issue which has already been recognized as one of the main challenges for solid-state LOBs. The solid-state cells from these two works exhibited both long cycle life and high throughput capacity. Both cases encourage a strategic focus on addressing fundamental challenges in solid-state LOBs. By concentrating on these critical issues, researchers are making significant progress in improving the longevity and overall performance of solid-state LOBs, advancing them toward practical application. This analysis shows that the performance of solid-state LOBs has improved to some extent over the past decade. However, most studies are limited to low current densities and small specific capacities, indicating that current solid-state materials or solid-state LOB systems are not yet capable of supporting high areal capacity cycle testing effectively. Among these 48 research articles, there exists a large range of different materials with different performances. The types of SSE materials used from 2009 to 2024 are shown in Figure 2a. They were primarily categorized into five classes: polymer, lithium lanthanum titanium oxide (LLTO), lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO), lithium aluminium germanium phosphate (LAGP) or LATP, and composite types. Polymer refers to SSEs primarily composed of a polymer matrix and Li+ salt. LLTO, LLZO, and LAGP or LATP refer to SSEs where these materials constitute the majority composition, without polymers. The composite type includes SSEs made from Li+ salt, polymers, and additional materials such as metal&#8211;organic frameworks, perovskite (LLTO), garnet (LLZO or LLZTO), or NASICON-type (LAGP or LATP) materials. It is clear that NASICON-type and polymer type are always common choices across the decades. LLZO and composite types have been extensively studied since 2017. After 2021, composite types have become the primary choice for SSE. This shift likely reflects researchers' efforts to address a wider range of challenges by incorporating diverse materials into SSEs, thereby enhancing overall performance factors such as mechanical stability, ionic conductivity, and interface impedance. Figure 2 | Materials for SSE. (a) Materials selection trend for SSE over time; (b) Cycle life; and (c) throughput capacity distribution for different SSE materials. Download figure Download PowerPoint The cycle life and throughput capacity distribution for different SSE materials are shown in Figure 2b,c. Composite type SSE show the widest range of cycle number and throughput capacities, suggesting that composites are relatively mature among the material studied, though high cycle life (&gt;200) remains rare. The LAGP/LATP group shows most studies distributed in the low cycle life (0&#8211;50 and 50&#8211;100) and low throughput capacity (0&#8211;10 and 10&#8211;25), indicating that these materials often experience early capacity fade, potentially due to instability of SSE materials and high interfacial impedance. Two studies report exceptionally high throughput capacities exceeding 200; however, their cells were immersed in a certain amount of ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC) liquid electrolyte. The LLTO and LLZO types exhibit similar moderate cycle life and throughput capacity, though LLZO studies scatter across a wider range. Polymer-based solid-state LOBs show a relatively even distribution across all ranges, suggesting varied performance outcomes depending on other factors, such as specific polymer formulation and cell design. Though composite and polymer types show potential in terms of cycle life and throughput capacity, there is still significant room for improvement across all material types. In addition, the composite-type solid-state LOBs with an integrated SSE/cathode structure is a promising strategy to solve the interfacial impedance issue.46 This design minimizes the physical and chemical mismatches at the interface, leading to improved ionic conductivity and reduced resistance. Additionally, the integrated structure enhances mechanical stability, mitigates the formation of voids or cracks during cycling, and ensures better contact between active materials, ultimately improving cycle life and overall cell performance. Achieving high cycle life and throughput capacity in solid-state LOBs remains challenging, especially for LAGP/LATP, LLTO, and LLZO materials. This suggests that future research should prioritize enhancing the stability and compatibility of these materials. Additionally, optimizing the composition and structure of composites and polymers could further enhance their performance, positioning them as one of the leading candidates for the next generation of solid-state LOBs. The average throughput capacity, cycle number, and operating current density of each type of SSE materials are summarized in Supporting Information Figure S1. Polymer-based electrolytes exhibit the highest cycle numbers, suggesting superior stability during cycling. However, their throughput capacity is moderate, indicating potential limitations in achieving high capacity. LAGP/LATP and composite materials show relatively balanced performance, with moderate cycle numbers and decent throughput capacities. This balance may make them suitable for applications where both cycle number and capacity are critical. LLZO displays a lower throughput capacity but competitive cycle numbers, while LLTO demonstrates higher throughput capacity, indicating potential for high-rate applications. Reporting Practices Due to the rather nascent nature of the field of solid-state LOB, reporting practices are not as well established as adjacent battery fields. At times, there are crucial details that are missing from articles that can greatly sway the conclusion of the study. One such detail is the degree of liquid addition. An all-solid-state LOB is appealing due to its potential for achieving high energy density and excellent safety performance. However, the cycle performance of all-solid-state LOBs is severely limited by poor interfacial contact. To enhance the overall performance of solid-state LOBs, researchers have opted to incorporate liquid electrolytes during cell fabrication. Several methods are used to achieve this: (1) adding a "few" microliters of tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) to the SSE slurry during membrane fabrication; (2) soaking the SSE in a 1 M LiTFSI solution with TEGDME as the solvent; (3) adding a few microliters of 1 M LiTFSI with TEGDME to the cathode during cell assembly. The boiling point of TEGDME is as high as 275 &#176;C, which is hard to evaporate even under vacuum conditions. We summarized the percentage of SSEs incorporating liquid electrolyte across all 48 studies. Any study that explicitly described using one of the liquid incorporation methods mentioned above was considered a liquid inclusive study. As shown in Figure 3a, 35.4% of studies incorporated liquid electrolyte or solvent. In 64.6% of the studies, there was no claim of the direct use of liquid electrolyte. However, it is also noted that common polymer solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and dimethylformamide (DMF), cannot be fully removed by vacuum drying at typical temperatures of 50&#8211;80 &#176;C, as used in many studies.7 These solvent molecules can also interact with Li+ salt molecules, making complete removal unlikely. Therefore, 64.6% of studies cannot be conclusively classified as fully solid-state LOBs, as residual liquid may remain in the SSEs. Based on these criteria, we have identified eight studies that likely describe 100% all-solid-state electrolytes with negligible liquid content, as noted in Supporting Information Table S1. These electrolytes are predominantly LAGP- or LLZO-based and are fabricated using methods such as cold pressing, hot pressing, or sintering. Figure 3 | Reporting practices. (a) Percentage of studies incorporating liquid in solid-state LOBs. (b) Distribution of operation temperature for solid-state LOBs. (c) Availability of DEMS results across 48 papers. (d) Number of loading information reported across 48 papers. Download figure Download PowerPoint Though performance improved, the involvement of liquid electrolyte or solvent would introduce additional challenges: (1) Liquid solvents, such as TEGDME, can still decompose into byproducts, as observed liquid-state LOB cells, leading to increased overpotential and reduced cycle life; (2) the performance improvements brought by liquid residue may diminish over time due to the gradual evaporation of the liquid, such as NMP and DMF; and (3) some solvents, such as dimethylsulfoxide, are known to be reactive with intermediates in the LOB reactions.47 Adding liquid without careful design solely for performance improvement risks being a shortsighted solution without addressing the fundamental issues of solid-state LOBs. The percentage of operation temperature of solid-state LOBs is also summarized in Figure 3b. Of the works, 83.7% focus their studies on room temperature (25 &#176;C). It is known that elevated temperature can improve ion conductivity of SSE, resulting in an improvement of battery performance. Several studies operated their cells at higher temperatures because they used pure LLZO or LAGP to fabricate the SSE, which may imply insufficient conductivity (especially at the interfaces) at room temperature. In general, room temperature solid-state LOBs are more practical, but high temperature solid-state LOBs are also valuable for certain extreme operating conditions. Li2O2 titration and DEMS results are important indicators of ORR and OER efficiency. Li2O2 can be quantified by Ti(IV)OSO4 solution though UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy technique or by potassium iodide under acidic conditions, the resulting elemental iodine (I2) can be titrated using sodium thiosulfate solution (Na2S2O3).48,49 DEMS can quantify gas evolution and evaluate electron transfer number of OER process. However, most studies lack titration results, and only 12.5% of them include DEMS data (Figure 3c). It is understandable that the discharge products of LOBs are influenced by various factors, such as SSE materials, liquid fraction, and cathode composition. Additionally, some studies may not focus on the discharge products of the first cycle. However, high-performance solid-state LOBs typically begin with a promising initial result, making it important to include this fundamental information at the early stages of research. Some solid-state LOB systems can even discharge without oxygen or charge in the absence of Li2O2 because the complex battery system includes multiple materials, some of which may decompose during operation. Without basic characterizations, such as discharge product confirmation and DEMS analysis, it is challenging to confirm whether the cell operates via a true oxygen redox electrochemical process or majorly through irreversible side reaction. Future research should prioritize using titration to determine the Li2O2 yield rate during the ORR process and DEMS to measure O2 evolution during the OER process. Combining these results will enable accurate calculations of the true efficiency of solid-state LOBs. Additionally, conducting these tests at various cycle numbers of cycled cells can provide deeper insights into performance degradation and reaction mechanisms over time. Although irreversible, since the cycling areal capacity is controlled to be small, the large mass of cell component can sustain cycling that appears to be reversible. In fact, the mass of many of the cell components remains to be under reported. To estimate energy density of a solid-state LOB, some basic loading information is needed, including mass loading of anode, SSE, cathode, and catalysts/carbon loading on the cathode. The number of loading information reported across the 48 papers is summarized in Figure 3d. Unfortunately, only a meager 4 out of the 48 studies have all information available to calculate energy density at the chemistry level (mass of anode, electrolyte, cathode). Taking the weight of the above battery components without case into account, their energy densities are 33.47, 542.1, and 727.84 Wh/kg.16,30,45 We can observe a trend of improvement in the energy density of solid-state LOBs, increasing from 33.47 Wh/kg in 2009 to 727.84 Wh/kg in 2018, although it still falls short of practical levels.50 More importantly, with 91.7% of studies lacking the necessary loading information to calculate cell energy density, it is difficult to claim whether advancements in energy densities have been made. This indicates that most research groups are not yet focused on achieving high energy density and are likely still studying the fundamental mechanism of the system. To have a better comparison among different studies in the future, it is recommended that all studies report specific loading information of each battery components, especially the unit of performance matrix is mA/g or mAh/g. It is also important to specify liquid addition and operation temperature information. Relationship Among Different Performance Metrics Although energy density cannot be calculated for many of the 48 papers, we can still draw some conclusions about the performance of solid-state LOB. Specifically, the correlations among current densities, throughput capacity, and cycle number are further examined to investigate the research stage of solid-state LOBs. In general, cells cycling at low current densities are expected to achieve a higher cycle number and larger throughput capacity as the Li metal anode is known to behave better at low current densities while the air cathode is known to experience side reaction-inducing overpotential. This appears to be somewhat true when looking at the cycle life versus current density plot shown in Figure 4a. Solid-state LOBs cycled at low current densities tend to have longer cycle numbers. However, when the throughput capacity is used, we see that lower current density does not significantly imply high throughput capacity (Figure 4b). In fact, there is little trend between the throughput capacity versus current density. If the throughput capacity is taken as a more significant metric than cycle number for quantifying performance, this suggests that the current density regime that is commonly operated are not influential to the performance. Other factors beyond current densities, such as interfacial impedance, stability of SSE, ionic conductivity, and compatibility and reactivity with lithium metal, play a more crucial role in determining the performance of solid-state LOBs. Figure 4 | Apparent relationship between different parameters. The correlation between (a) cycle number and current density; (b) throughput capacity and current density; and (c, d) throughput capacity and cycle number with unlimited liquid and limited liquid. Download figure Download PowerPoint The rate capability can depend on the ionic conductivity of SSE, interfacial impedance, and material stability. Ionic conductivity of SSE is not the primary limitation in rate capability of solid-state LOB performance. For example, a typical SSE with an ionic conductivity of 10&#8722;4 S/cm, a voltage drop of 0.2 V, and a thickness of around 200 &#956;m can theoretically support a current density of up to 1 mA/cm2, which is already higher than what is reported in most studies. Additionally, even at low rates, high energy density is achievable just as the process is simply slower. Similarly, if the voltage drop across the interface is 0.1 V and interfacial impedance increases from 200 to 500 ohms after long-term cycling, the maximum achievable current density will decrease 0.5&#8211;0.2 mA/cm2, reducing the cell rate performance. Such estimation proves the importance of interfacial impedance issues in a solid-state cell. It is also worth noting that the degradation of the SSE and cathode materials due to high current densities can further reduce performance, emphasizing the importance of stability studies. When the cases with unlimited and limited liquid electrolyte are analyzed separately, reasonably strong correlations (R2 = 0.77 or 0.76) are found between throughput capacity and cycle number (Figure 4c,d). This suggests that solid-state LOBs with longer cycle life also tend to have higher throughput capacity. Cells with high long-term stability are more likely to deliver better performance. Based on this, it is important to include more stability related studies, such as analysis of failure mechanisms and degradation of SSE, in research studies. However, most works have not yet incorporated or explored this information in depth. Meanwhile, most studies continue to focus on low cycle life and throughput capacity, indicating that current research on solid-state LOBs remains in the early stages. Conclusion In summary, solid-state Li-O2 batteries hold significant promise for high-energy-density energy storage solutions, suitable for advanced applications such as EVs, aviation, and portable electronics. Despite recent progress in material selection and performance optimization, these batteries still face critical challenges, including low current density, limited cycle capacity, and persistent issues with interfacial impedance and stability. Our analysis suggests that reporting practices, particularly regarding liquid content and operational conditions, are essential to enhance consistency and comparability across studies. Availability of DEMS and titration are important results to ensure that batteries are operating through a true oxygen redox electrochemical process. The loading amount is also essential to calculate and compare energy density of cells across all other solid-state LOB studies and battery chemistries. The relationships among different performance matrixes reveal that current research on solid-state LOBs remains in its infancy. To achieve practic</description>

      <title>Locoregional Anesthesia Due to Tumescence in Bilateral Total Mastectomy of Goats</title>
      <link>https://doi.org/10.22456/1679-9216.124154</link>
      <description>Gisele Pereira Guimaraes, Kelly Regina Freitas Freire, B Blanc, Egle Raoni de Brito Montenegro, Bruno Ferreira Sp&#237;ndola, Michel Abdalla Helayel, Saulo Andrade Caldas, ACTA SCIENTIAE VETERINARIAE. 50(None)] 2022. https://openalex.org/W4405719926

                Background: Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland or udder, regardless of its origin, severity, or evolution. Bilateral total mastectomy is indicated in cases of chronic suppurative mastitis, gangrenous mastitis, udder neoplasm or hyperplasia. For mastectomy, the supine position is recommended and, as it is a long-term procedure, general anesthesia was chosen together with the tumescence technique with the objective of transanesthetic and postoperative analgesia. The present report aims to report the general anesthesia protocol used for 2 goats submitted to bilateral total mastectomy associated with a locoregional block by tumescence, a technique not described in the goat species. Cases: Two female goats, mixed breed, approximately 3 years old, were admitted to the Hospital Veterin&#225;rio de Grandes Animais (HVGA) of the Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ), with a history of recurrent mastitis. There was an increase in udder volume and the presence of purulent secretion during milking. One of the animals had given birth about 20 days ago. Surgical treatment through bilateral total mastectomy was recommended for both animals, as they did not present a satisfactory response to antimicrobial therapy, excessive enlargement and functional loss of the mammary system. For the procedure, food fasting for 48 h and water fasting for 24 h was established. The anesthetic protocols used consisted of previous sedation with xylazine&#185; [Xilazin&#174; - 0.05 mg/kg, IM] anesthetic induction with ketamine&#178; [Ketalex&#174; - 10 mg/kg, IV] and midazolam&#179; [Dormire&#174; - 0.1 mg/kg, IV]. Orotracheal intubation and connection to the anesthetic circuit were performed for maintenance through inhalation anesthesia with isoflurane4 (Forane&#174;) and oxygen therapy. Then, in bottle of lactated ringer's solution5 [Linhamax&#174; - 500 mL], lidocaine 2%6 without vasoconstrictor [Lidovet&#174; - 40 mL] and adrenaline7 [Adren&#174; - 25 mg/mL, 0.5 mL] were added, 10 mL/kg of the solution were injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the region of the mammary chains utilizing a Klein cannula after local antisepsis. After the administration of the tumescent solution, it was observed that the area involved is presented with the formation of a gel and there is minimal bleeding, compared to the conventional technique. The animals were monitored for the degree of analgesia, recording vital signs every 15 min at the end of the surgery, dipyrone9 [D-500&#174; - 25 mg/kg, IV], morphine7 [Sulfato de Morfina&#174; - 0.1 mg/kg, SC], and meloxicam10 [Maxican&#174; 0.5 mg/kg, IM, 3 consecutive days] for postoperative analgesia. Additionally, tetanus serum1 [Vencosat&#174; - 50,000 IU, single dose] and of oxytetracycline&#185; [Oxitetraciclina LA&#174; - 10 mg/kg, IM, 5 applications on alternate days)]. In the following 24 h, no signs of pain were observed on palpation of the surgical wound in the animals, but goat 1 was apathetic and inappetent, with improvement in the clinical picture only 48 h after surgery. Discussion: The choice of the surgical procedure resulted in an improvement in the clinical conditions of the animals and the anesthetic protocol using inhalation anesthesia and locoregional block (tumescence) proved to be efficient to perform in goats, contributing to transanesthetic and postoperative analgesia, being easily applied to ruminants that need surgical interventions in the region of mammary chains.

Characterized by confined structures, these materials exhibit exceptional properties that differ fundamentally from their bulk counterparts, including enhanced electronic, optical, chemical, and catalytic functionalities. With applications spanning energy storage, catalysis, and optoelectronics, low-dimensional nanomaterials offer unparalleled opportunities for developing advanced technologies. (1,13&#8722;15,26&#8722;29) This Forum (Special Issue) explores the design, synthesis, characterization, and application of low-dimensional nanomaterials, with a particular focus on their role in energy applications.The versatility of low-dimensional nanomaterials lies in their ability to undergo precise tuning at the atomic or molecular level, which allows for optimization in a wide range of energy applications. 0D nanoparticles and clusters, characterized by a high proportion of surface atoms relative to their volume and exhibiting quantum confinement effects, are ideal for catalytic and energy storage applications. For example, FeCo bimetallic alloy nanoparticles embedded in nitrogen-doped porous carbon significantly enhance the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity in zinc&#8211;air batteries. (3) This synergy between bimetallic nanoparticles and pyridinic nitrogen-active sites delivers a half-wave potential superior to commercial Pt/C, showcasing the potential of nanoparticle-based catalysts.

In addition to LIBs, metal&#8211;air batteries, including zinc&#8211;air and lithium&#8211;air systems, rely heavily on efficient catalysts to overcome the sluggish oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER). Low-dimensional materials have enabled significant breakthroughs in this field. In lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries, amorphous RuO2 supported on TiO2 nanosheets outperforms its crystalline counterpart by promoting smaller and more reversible Li2O2 deposits. (35) This amorphous structure improves the discharge capacity (2.3 mAh/cm2) and extends cycling stability to 160 cycles, demonstrating the critical role of material morphology in optimizing catalytic performance.

However, the larger ionic radius of Na+ or K+ poses challenges for electrode materials to deliver stable cycling performance. Low-dimensional structures offer practical solutions. For example, by a nanoscale coating of octadecylamine chains, hydrophobic Prussian blue (PB) cathodes with open structures overcome moisture sensitivity during fabrication and usage. (36) This modification ensures stable capacities (145 mAh/g at 1 C) even after extended exposure to humid environments.

An in situ-formed Fe-based protective layer provides a novel solution by suppressing dendrite formation and enhancing ionic conductivity. (38) This artificial SEI improves the cycling stability of potassium metal anodes to over 1700 h, highlighting the importance of interface engineering in ensuring long-term battery performance.

(American Chemical Society) A review. Isolated atoms featuring unique reactivity are at the heart of enzymic and homogeneous catalysts. In contrast, although the concept has long existed, single-atom heterogeneous catalysts (SACs) have only recently gained prominence. Host materials have similar functions to ligands in homogeneous catalysts, detg. the stability, local environment, and electronic properties of isolated atoms and thus providing a platform for tailoring heterogeneous catalysts for targeted applications. Within just a decade, we have witnessed many examples of SACs both disrupting diverse fields of heterogeneous catalysis with their distinctive reactivity and substantially enriching our understanding of mol. processes on surfaces. To date, the term SAC mostly refers to late transition metal-based systems, but numerous examples exist in which isolated atoms of other elements play key catalytic roles. This review provides a compositional encyclopedia of SACs, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the introduction of this term. By defining single-atom catalysis in the broadest sense, we explore the full elemental diversity, joining different areas across the whole periodic table, and discussing historical milestones and recent developments. In particular, we examine the coordination structures and assocd. properties accessed through distinct single-atom-host combinations and relate them to their main applications in thermo-, electro-, and photocatalysis, revealing trends in element-specific evolution, host design, and uses. Finally, we highlight frontiers in the field, including multimetallic SACs, atom proximity control, and possible applications for multistep and cascade reactions, identifying challenges, and propose directions for future development in this flourishing field. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3cXitFSltL3P&amp;md5=f4c3e96ec0d47aa32db16737ef0965e62Fei, H.; Dong, J.; Feng, Y.; Allen, C.

(Nature Research) Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have recently attracted broad research interest as they combine the merits of both homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts. Rational design and synthesis of SACs are of immense significance but have so far been plagued by the lack of a definitive correlation between structure and catalytic properties. Here, we report a general approach to a series of monodispersed at. transition metals (for example, Fe, Co, Ni) embedded in nitrogen-doped graphene with a common MN4C4 moiety, identified by systematic X-ray absorption fine structure analyses and direct transmission electron microscopy imaging. The unambiguous structure detn. allows d. functional theor. prediction of MN4C4 moieties as efficient oxygen evolution catalysts with activities following the trend Ni &gt; Co &gt; Fe, which is confirmed by electrochem. measurements. Detn. of atomistic structure and its correlation with catalytic properties represents a crit. step towards the rational design and synthesis of precious or nonprecious SACs with exceptional atom utilization efficiency and catalytic activities. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BC1MXhtFGisLzN&amp;md5=ba4f0c2bc55d7aa8cc41ca3196bd2cde3Li, W.; Zhang, M.; Xie, X.; Liang, A.; Peng, H.; Ma, G.; Xu, Y.

(Nature Publishing Group) Nanowires and nanotubes carry charge and excitons efficiently, and are therefore potentially ideal building blocks for nanoscale electronics and optoelectronics. Carbon nanotubes have already been exploited in devices such as field-effect and single-electron transistors, but the practical utility of nanotube components for building electronic circuits is limited, as it is not yet possible to selectively grow semiconducting or metallic nanotubes. Here we report the assembly of functional nanoscale devices from indium phosphide nanowires, the elec. properties of which are controlled by selective doping. Gate-voltage-dependent transport measurements demonstrate that the nano- wires can be predictably synthesized as either n- or p-type. These doped nanowires function as nanoscale field-effect transistors, and can be assembled into crossed-wire p-n junctions that exhibit rectifying behavior. Significantly, the p-n junctions emit light strongly and are perhaps the smallest light-emitting diodes that have yet been made. Finally, we show that elec.-field-directed assembly can be used to create highly integrated device arrays from nanowire building blocks. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BD3MXkt1WqsA%253D%253D&amp;md5=4afc91799c3ba9d1f2b1627f3861c3d97Huang, Y.; Duan, X.; Wei, Q.; Lieber, C.

(American Association for the Advancement of Science) One-dimensional nanostructures, such as nanowires and nanotubes, represent the smallest dimension for efficient transport of electrons and excitons and thus are ideal building blocks for hierarchical assembly of functional nanoscale electronic and photonic structures. The authors report an approach for the hierarchical assembly of one-dimensional nanostructures into well-defined functional networks. They show that nanowires can be assembled into parallel arrays with control of the av. sepn. and, by combining fluidic alignment with surface-patterning techniques, that it is also possible to control periodicity. In addn., complex crossed nanowire arrays can be prepd. with layer-by-layer assembly with different flow directions for sequential steps.

(Elsevier Ltd.) One-dimensional (1D) tellurium (Te) nanowires (NWs) have triggered intense attention due to their remarkable properties in electronics, optoelectronics and nonlinear optics. However, the saturable absorption properties of Te NWs and the ability to be bleached by strong pulsed energy need to be further improved. Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures based on two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) exhibit prominent nonlinear optical properties. Direct epitaxial growth of large-area 1D/2D Te-TMDC vdW heterostructures is still rarely investigated. Herein, we demonstrate the controllable epitaxial growth of large-scale 1D/2D vertical Te-TMDC heterostructures via two-step vapor phase deposition method. Our exptl. results have confirmed that the saturable absorption properties of as-prepd. Te-TMDC heterostructures can be obviously enhanced. The first principle calcns. and surface potential measurements demonstrate that effective interlayer charge transfer between Te NWs and TMDC nanosheets is beneficial for promoting the saturable absorption properties. Systematic investigation of vdW Te-TMDC heterostructures with nonlinear optical properties is vital for the next generation of nanophotonics and integrated photonics, which paves the way for the development of saturable absorbers and light modulators based on Te-TMDC vdW heterostructures. &gt;&gt; More from SciFinder &#174;https://chemport.cas.org/services/resolver?origin=ACS&amp;resolution=options&amp;coi=1%3ACAS%3A528%3ADC%252BB3sXntlyqtLY%253D&amp;md5=7c55c94e2eaaffd6580ecb1adc8a16fd9Wang, K.; Sun, J.; Yang, H.; Zhang, Y.; Zhong, X.; Song, Y.; Hou, F.; Zhang, Y.; Zhang, Z.; Wang, H.

A broad range of topics are covered, among these, energy and biorelated research take center stage, with a significant number of papers dedicated to these fields. Given the diversity of the topics, it is challenging to single out individual contributions. Instead, I have approached this by analyzing the prevailing trends across the Forum.Energy research is undergoing a transformative phase, fueled by advancements in catalysts, photocatalysts, batteries materials, and fabrication techniques. These breakthroughs are driving innovations in energy storage, harvesting, and conversion technologies, offering sustainable and efficient solutions for the future.
